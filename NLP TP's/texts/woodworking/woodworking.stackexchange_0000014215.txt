Q:

What are some easy types of wood to start woodcarving?

I found some posts with tools to start with but now I am trying to figure out what type of wood to start with. I imagine a soft, easy to carve wood is best and probably cheaper?

A:

Basswood is generally the most recommended wood to start with. White pine should also work, but the details may not be as fine. Other good carving woods include butternut (also known as white walnut), aspen, and black walnut, although its price is rather high right now. If you live near a specialty woodworking store like Rockler or Woodcraft or similar, they should have a whole carving section including a variety of wood blanks, including basswood. You can also order blanks of various sizes online.
