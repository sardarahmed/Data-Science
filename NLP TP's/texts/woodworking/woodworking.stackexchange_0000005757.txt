Q:

How thin can a large dovetail tail be?

I'm building a small (12"D x 24"W) workbench for doing woodwork in my apartment. I want to dovetail the legs to the top, but the tail on the end will be about 1/2" wide on the narrower end. Is this acceptable, given that the tail will be about 1-3/4" deep (thickness of the top)? Will it be too weak? 

A:

That joint looks strong enough to me.
The bigger problem, though, is that you will have wood movement issues.  The top will get bigger and smaller seasonally (in the front-to-back direction) while the board you're joining to it will not.  This is because the grain in the top is running perpendicular to the other board.
I would suggest redesigning this as a sliding dovetail or a pinned mortise and tenon with enlarged pin holes on the tenon (like a breadboard).
(This is assuming that the board on the end is oriented in the normal fashion.  If it has the end grain on the top then there would be no problem with movement.)
