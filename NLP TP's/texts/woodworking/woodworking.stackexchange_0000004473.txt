DIY Kiln Dry Walnut Plan

I have a small Kiln used for pottery. I use it to melt aluminum for casting. I was thinking about building an enclosed space (like plastic sheet walls), putting that kiln inside to dry some walnut slabs. Would have fans at one end (same end as the kiln) blowing towards the stacked and stickered wood. Prob then have the opposite end venting outside to get rid of the moisture. 
My question: would this work better than air drying (better means faster)? What temp would I want the enclosure to reach to quickly dry walnut without limited side effects?
Or is this all just a stupid idea?

A:

would work faster than air
depends on drying stage and the wood (you want to prevent cracking)
not a stupid idea

http://extension.missouri.edu/p/G5507 is a good resource for you. 
You'll likely need a separate thermostat/controller for your wood drying kiln (the kiln itself might have one, but i doubt it controls to low enough temperatures for wood!). It could be accomplished by cycling the power to the kiln on and off. The above link says that temps range from 120-190 ÂºF, depending on the stage of drying.
