Q:

Dust collection - Do proper shop vacs/dust collectors eject much air?

This may be a silly question, but I have no experience with proper dust collectors/shop vacs.
Do shop vacs/dust collectors, when operating, eject much air? I ask as I have a super cheap wet/dry vaccuum, that has a blower feature; and when I turn the vac on, it instantly begins both sucking and blowing simultaneously. I find this... annoying as it starts blowing crap everywhere that I would like to not be blown around!
I've been working in my garden for a while but I'm getting a proper workshop shed soon so will definitely not want things blowing around!

Yes. All the air that a dust collector or shop vac sucks in, which is a lot, has to come out somewhere.
Exactly how the air is returned varies. Dust collectors generally return the air through some sort of filter that's much larger than the 4" or 6" intake, so the output is diffused quite a lot -- there's no blast of air from an exhaust port.
Some shop vacs also diffuse the exhaust so that there's no blast of air, but others send the air out an exhaust port. That's supposed to be a feature, as you can use the machine either to suck up debris or to blow it away. If it bothers you, I think you've got two options:

Buy a different shop vac that does a better job diffusing the outgoing air.

Make or buy a diffuser that you can add to the vac you have. It wouldn't take much to break up the stream of air so that it's no longer blowing things around.

Here's a diffuser from Craftsman that would probably work on any vac with a 2 1/2" output port:
