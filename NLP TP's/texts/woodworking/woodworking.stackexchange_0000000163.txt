Q:

Treating pine for partial burial

I'm replacing my garden edging (the separator between lawn and flower beds), and I have some treated pine I would like to use. 
Like this:

What's the best way to stop the pine from rotting?

A:

Buy pressure treated lumber. It's going to cost more than plain pine, but it will last significantly longer in direct contact with the ground, as that's what it's intended for. There's a reason that every telephone/power pole you see is that dark green color.

A:

You might want to consider non-toxic alternatives:

You could use plastic edging, possibly reinforced with stakes.
You could choose thin, untreated lumber that you are willing to have rot.  This would enrich the soil.  Choose thin, narrow lumber, so that it does not leave behind a hole big enough to break someone's ankle.
You could place a gravel border.  Embed the stones in the ground, so that you can safely run a lawnmower wheel along the border, without risking "mowing" the stones.
Consider using redwood, cedar, or another wood that rots more slowly than regular lumber, but is less toxic than pressure-treated lumber.
