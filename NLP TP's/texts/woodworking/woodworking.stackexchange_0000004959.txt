Advice on repairing a broken bed

We recently moved and a bed was not put back together properly (wrong screws were used). As a result one of the boards split where a screw joins the long side board to a leg. You can see the split and screw hole at the top of the picture below. The board split cleanly and the other part (not pictured) is one complete piece.
I'm not experienced in wood working and have done only small repairs before. Can I just (clamp and) glue the two parts back together? Will it hold? Do I need any additional braces or supports? Any tips on making it look nice if braces are needed?

A:

It appears you are on the right track. It should be possible to repair the piece by gluing it.  You will need 3 or 4 clamps to keep the loose piece in full contact with the board shown in the photo.  Use a wood glue such as Titebond (1,2, 0r 3 will all work) available at hardware stores, Home Depot or Lowes.  Place ample glue on both contact faces liberally so that some will squeeze out when the clamps are tightened. You can clean up the squeeze out with a damp rag. Let the whole thing set overnight and it should be ready to reassemble.  Good Luck!
