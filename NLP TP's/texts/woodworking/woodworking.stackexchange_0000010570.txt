Q:

What is this item he is holding in this video?

I was watching a YouTube video about DIY sofa upholstery. At 17:34 the guy pulls out some sort of long metal plate with screw-like protrusions on one side.

I would like to be able to order (or make) one of those. So what are those called?

A:

What you seek is called an upholstery tack strip. The screw-like protrusions are barbs rather than screws and snag/catch the fabric to be stretched and secured.
A quick search using these terms return many results with varied prices and locations to purchase.
