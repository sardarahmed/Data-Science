Q:

Joint in curtain rods

How can I secure joint in wooden curtain rod to make sure it does not give way because of heavy curtains.  We already have a bracket in the middle and one at each end.
Many thanks

A:

I don't know how this is done elsewhere in the world but where I am this is often (usually?) done using what's called a dowel screw:

Dowel screws come in a few variants, try to buy the type exactly as in the picture with the unthreaded portion in the centre that you can grip with pliers or vice-grips.
Note: these must go into a pre-drilled holes in the wood or you'll almost certainly split the rod. Making the hole perfectly centred and square to the ends requires careful marking out and drilling.
I can say from personal experience that it's not easy to install these straight! But once installed they can work quite well to keep two halves of a curtain rail in line even with heavy velvet curtains and their lining.
