Q:

Which way does spring washer go on the Ryobi circular saw

I just purchased a Ryobi 7 1/4 circular saw. Model CSB125. I am attaching the saw blade and I canâ€™t remember which way to put the spring washer back on. It is beveled, shaped like an umbrella. The washer is part #49 in this diagram. Thanks

A:

The bottom/wide part of the spring washer #49 would go against the outer washer #27.  The blade screw #28 presses against the crown of #49 creating a locking pressure.
