Q:

Is there a canonical source for retrieving Material Safety Data Sheets?

Is there a convenient, easy-to-access source for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSes) that does not require registration or payment?
A good website or reference book for wood-working MSDSes should make it easy to look up:

Products by manufacturer or brand name (such as Copper-Green Brown)
Products by chemical name (such as copper naphthenate)
Include a wide variety of wood working materials, glues, and finishes
Not require registration

A:

I'm not sure if it's required by law, but many companies make their MSDSes publicly available for free.
For example:

http://www.titebond.com/ProductMSDSCO.php
http://msds.gp.com/msdsinternet/?bu=bp

In addition, some resellers provide the MSDSes for products they sell:

http://www.highlandwoodworking.com/material-safety-datasheets-msds.aspx

You can also often find the MSDS for a product or chemical by searching for the product or chemical name along with "msds" in Google, Bing, etc.
