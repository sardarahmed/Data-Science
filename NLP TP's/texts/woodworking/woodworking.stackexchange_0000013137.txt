Q:

Filling Hole with Sawdust & Glue

I gouged out a rotted section on my outdoor deck rail surface approximtely 12" long & 2-3" deep.  Advised to fill with sawdust/glue mixture.  Should I fill all at once, or build-up/fill gradually...if so, how many inches at a time?  Thanks so much!

A:

I'd advise not trying to fill a void that big with glue and dust. Wood doesn't really like being treated like car bondo. Smaller voids and cracks can be filled with putty or home-made filler, but in general it will not last outdoors. Larger voids need to be filled in successive layers, and the layers will be more like 3/16ths of an inch or less. A 12" by 2" void is missing lumber, not a void to be filled with glue.
Either replace the member completely by scarfing a new length in, or chisel out the void and fill it with a "key" piece carefully fitted and glued to the void. Once cured you pare it to size with a chisel and/or plane.
It sounds like you need to replace the piece completely, but a photo added to your Question might answer that.
It really depends on how badly the piece is damaged, how it interfaces with other members, and how essential to load-bearing the affected member(s) are. If this is part of a deck that is there for safety and is intended to hold the entire mass of a stumbling human, then you absolutely cannot fill such a void with any kind of filler glue and junk. It is better to not have any safety railing (or whatever this is) than one that will give way immediately under a sudden load.
Not only is this contrary to any building code where such codes exist, it's the sort of thing that leads to broken bones and death.
