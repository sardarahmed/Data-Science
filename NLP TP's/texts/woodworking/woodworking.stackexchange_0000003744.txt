Q:

Glue joint bit, recommended?

I was wondering if I should get a glue joint router bit to make the glue joints. It would make it stay in place better and stronger right? What would you all think about that? All input is greatly appreciated.

Glue joints, when properly prepared, are at least as strong as the wood material that they are bonding.  Even a simple panel joint (two boards glued to each other along the long grain) is very strong at the joint.
Adding the "fingers" that this type of router bit does nothing to increase the strength of a long-grain glue joint.  These types of router bits are useful when joining end grain, like you see in a lot of manufactured furniture (IKEA, for example).

For end grain, the fingers supply much-needed long-grain-to-long-grain glue surface, which is much stronger than an end-grain-to-end-grain butt joint.

You are correct, this type of router bit would help align the two boards for gluing (assuming you set everything up correctly when using the router bit).
Bottom line, unless you're joining end grain to end grain, you don't need one.
