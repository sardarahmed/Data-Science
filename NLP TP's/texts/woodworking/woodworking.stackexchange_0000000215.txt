Q:

What woods are soft enough for glazier points?

I'm working on building square picture frames and holding in glass, image, and cardboard backing. I'm concerned that certain hard woods may not be appropriate for glazier points; in particular I am unsure of whether or not the points will stay in place in the long term. 
Is there a 'hardness limit' to which woods would be appropriate for this?
For reference, a glazier point is a small clip that is imbedded in the internal edge of the frame to hold the contents against the glass:

Within reason I don't believe there is. Many picture frames are made of pine of course so anything like a glazing point or finish nail can be pushed or lightly hammered into the surface without difficulty. But even with oak and beech frames points can usually be pushed in using only the pressure provided by a flathead screwdriver tip. Although a better tool for doing this is a firm-bladed putty knife. 
If there is some difficulty they can be squeezed in. There are a variety of commercial tools made to do this but any wide-mouth pliers (e.g. Channellock pliers) can be used for the purpose, with some card or scrap wood on the outside surface to protect the frame from bruising or denting:

They appear to hold fine over time. There are reports of them shifting and even falling out but that is also the case with small brads/finish nails.

If you're looking for a method to secure the contents of the frame and aren't particularly attached to glazier points, you could try something like a turn button. You can pilot the screw holes to secure the turn buttons, so it shouldn't matter as much if you're working with softwoods or hardwoods.
