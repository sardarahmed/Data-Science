Q:

Is it needed to have the lever cap flat against the blade in a shoulder plane?

I bought an approximately cheap small (1/2" width) shoulder plane from Dictum.
However I observed that only the toe of the lever cap presses on the blade (see picture above).
Should I tree to grind it to maximize the contact surface or it's no use to do that?

A:

This is normal. Shoulder planes of this design always like this.

Maybe best example:
