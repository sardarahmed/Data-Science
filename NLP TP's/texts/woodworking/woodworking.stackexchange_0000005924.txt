Q:

Do I need to worry about incidental contact between a finish and its thinner / solvent once it's cured?

This is probably most applicable for water-based finishes, but I suppose it could be generalized to all finishes. 
Once a finish has dried / cured, do I need to worry about incidental contact between a finish and its thinner / solvent? I'm not talking about leaving a piece finished with water-based poly outside in the rain, of course, but rather near a shower or sink, for instance. Will that contact with water eventually eat away the finish? Would it depend on the type of finish and/or how many coats and/or how thick each coat was?
I doubt you'd have a similar situation with oil-based finishes outside the shop, but what if you spilled mineral spirits, for example? Would you need to worry about refinishing?

A:

The answer is, it depends.  Finishes that "cure" after drying (like most oil-based products) will typically not be damaged by incidental contact with their solvent.  Finishes that only "dry" but do not cure (like shellac) can be removed with their solvent more-or-less indefinitely.
In your question specifically, water-borne products are not water soluble after they've cured.  Water-borne products are not actually water-based.  They have a finish material that is soluble in some solvent (typically glycol ether I think) that is itself soluble in water.  So they actually have 3 phases: water drying, solvent drying, finish curing.  Once the solvent has flashed off the finish is not water soluble at all.
