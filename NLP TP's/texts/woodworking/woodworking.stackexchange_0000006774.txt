Q:

Embedding/Inlaying a gem into wood

I am making a couple of purpleheart earrings. I want to embed an amethyst gem into each one. I have a couple of concerns though. The wood is so dark that I feel it will make the gem seem dark once it's embedded. How can I address this?
 Should I cut a hole all the way through the wood to let light into the gem? And how should I secure the gem? I'm thinking epoxy right now but depending on if I need to drill a hole all the way through I'm not sure if I should fill in the hole on the backside completely with epoxy or leave it open. 
This is what I have so far. The one on the right shows what I would like the finished product to look like.

A:

I am not an experienced woodworker, but I can offer a couple of suggestions.
First of all, if you think that the gem will look darker, you can try to have a light background in the hole (sometimes this trick is used to make look  the gem darker or vivid in the jewels), to test just make the hole and put a little piece of white paper as background (bonus: you can try with different paper colors without any problem). 
As you noted, another solution is to cut the hole all the way, but this change the overall look of the earrings, I don't say they will not be nice, just different.
About how to secure the gem, go for the epoxy or cyanoacrylate, just be sure they are cristal clear and, if you use the epoxy, that it has a high resistance to the UV or it will yellow with the time.
