Q:

How to recreate this bevel with ledge profile?

I'm wanting to build a display case like the one pictured, however I'm not sure how the 'ledge' at the top of the bevel is done.
I initially thought it would be router with chamfer bit and maybe table saw to do the notched ledge... Or it could be a router bit with an odd shape?
I can't quite get my head around it.
I have a jobsite tablesaw that I'm pretty new to, but I do also have my router.

A:

There are many different ways to get that profile, not One True Way.

Could all be done with a tablesaw
Could all be done with a shaper or router bit in one pass (faster to do, but more expensive and less generally useful)
Could all the done with two different router/shaper bits (slower to do, but more genererally useful)
Could all be done with hand planes.

None is more valid than another, one generally picks the method to suit the tools one has, unless following the siren song of suiting the tool you want an excuse to buy.
