Q:

How to calculate the angle for the legs?

I want to build the table on the photo, but can't figure out how to calculate the angle to cut the legs.
Table should be 2 m X 1 m x 75 cm (height)
Thank you

A:

Determine the displacement you wish for the legs. This measurement combined with the height, will allow you to calculate the angles required.

To calculate the angle of the lower left corner of the white triangle, divide the height by the displacement. Use the resulting number to determine the arctangent, either by google or a calculator. For example, if the height is 300 and the displacement is 400, the math results in 300/400 or 0.75. The arctangent of 0.75 is 36.9 degrees. When I used Google to determine the arctangent, it was necessary to specify "in degrees" as the answer was first presented in radians.
If the numbers are reversed, 400/300 is 1.333 resulting in a measurement of 53.1 degrees. You can see also that the reversal is the same as 90 degrees minus the previously calculated number.
NOTE: even though the word "displacement" encompasses the entire frame, the measurement is only of the white triangle segment.
