Q:

Can I screw in my cable tray into this desk?

So, I've had this desk for a few years now, and I just bought a cable tray that needs to be screwed in. It would go under the desk

Desk: https://www.wayfair.ca/furniture/pdp/upper-square-kosmas-writing-desk-c001698673.html
Top material described as: "Particle board, hollow-core, laminate, and MDF"
Top thickness: a little under 2"
Tray: https://www.autonomous.ai/office-accessories/cable-tray
Tray weight: 4lbs (I will only put cables on it, no adapters so the extra weight should be negligible)
Screws for the tray: M6x12 Screws (4)

My fear is that the tray won't hold if I screw it in, or that it could damage/rip the desk top seeing that the top has a hollow core
Any advice?

A:

You would not be able to use those machine screws to attach the tray directly to the desk.
You would either have to drill holes and insert a T-nut with a matching M6x12 thread, or you would need to replace the machine screws with an appropriate length x thickness wood screw.
Your concern about it ripping out if you mount it into the hollow-core section is absolutely spot on. You would, as Programmer66 said need to mount it along the back edge of the desktop where the solid wood (well, MDF) is located. To determine where the MDF ends, knock on the edge of the desk and listen to the sound, move in an inch or so and knock again, listening to the sound. Continue moving in until the sound changes - it should sound "hollow", or at least "different", somewhere toward the middle than it does at the edge. It is most likely that the solid filling takes up 1 1/2" in from the desk edge at most.
