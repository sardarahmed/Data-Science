Q:

How do I safely accomplish plunge cuts on a router table?

I am working on a cutting board and would like to plunge route "handles" into either side of it with a cove bit and it seems the best method would be with a router table.
What would be the technique to adequately support the work piece (cutting board, standing on end in this case) and also perform a plunge cut on the router table?
I've also found this result for accomplishing this with a handheld router, but my question is geared more generically to performing plunge cuts on a router table:
How can I make an inset cutting board handle?

A:

Plunge cuts on a router table are done by lowering the wood onto the spinning bit, holding it against the fence to stabilize it.
A higher-than-usual fence may help. Featherboards pushing the work piece agains the fence definitely help.
Marks can be made on the fence to indicate where the board should be at the start and end of the cut, so you can align the start properly and not overshoot the end.
As always, consider cutting to progressively greater depths until you reach your target depth rather than trying to do it all in a single pass.
Be sure to keep a firm grip on the board... But to keep your fingers safely away from the bit.
