Q:

How should I fix a broken chair stringer?

This part of the chair was damaged during shipping and I was wondering if it would be safe to glue together. 

The part on the left is a leg and the horizontal bar on the right supports the front of seat. I would imagine that the broken joint supports a bit of weight. Would glue be sufficient to hold it together?
The tenon is stuck firmly inside the mortise, I don't think I can extract it. If I were to attempt to glue it back together would I apply glue on the entire side face of the leg or just the broken tenon?
Here is a side view:

I have very little woodworking experience, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

A:

I agree with Ashlar's answer and I was going to say many of the same things, so I will just add some alternatives. My answer will depend on exactly what the break looks and how easy you think it will be to work with but if you want to try a little DIY here are some suggestions

The easiest option would be to glue it and then drive a screw through the joint, but that would probably not look very nice.
An alternative to the screw is to run a dowel though the leg and into the support. To do this you should glue the leg together and once the glue sets up drill a hole into the support then glue in the dowel and then cut the dowel flush. This image shows the theory I am describing but in your case you would want to run the dowel in from the other direction as your tenon is already stuck in the mortise.

If you are really worried about the outer face then you could try to embed the dowel inside the joint, this would be harder and require you to be very careful about hole size and placement but it is possible. Image from Wikimedia Commons
