Q:

Using green cedar for planks on a boat

I am building a Swampscott Dory as per "The Dory Book" by John Gardner.
What I am doing is using local wood (Red Cedar) and mills.  As such, I am starting from the log, milling it, and then making my boat.  Question is, how long should I wait for my planks to dry before placing them on the boat.  I am not using glue (all copper clench nails and wood screws) and all the wood is cut to my liking (quarter sawn).  So how long should I wait from mill to boat?  Log has been sitting out for about a year, but it was a 23" diameter log.

I was trying to find the answer to something else and realized there was a section in this book called, Modern Woodworking Techniques. It is a conglomeration of articles from the magazine Fine Woodworking. On page 124, they talk about drying your wood. It says that the "old-timers" rule of thumb is a year of air drying per inch of thickness, but ultimately you'll need to use a moisture meter to periodically test a sample board. Air drying will get you down to about 12% moisture content, unless you live in a very dry climate. For that matter, things like humidity, temperature, drying set-up (how you arrange your wood), and thickness has the most bearing on how fast your wood will dry. In other words, there is no set drying time ... it will take what it will take. There is no real way for us to give you a speculative answer as to how long it's going to take. You'll need to get a meter to tell you what the moisture content is and go from there.
