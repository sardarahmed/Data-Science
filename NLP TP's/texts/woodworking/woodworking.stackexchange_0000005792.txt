Q:

Any way to straighten this wood gate piece?

It wasn't until I got this gate piece screwed, glued, and hung up that I noticed there's a slight warp to it. I think it's due to just one piece in particular, but at this point I think I'm cooked. (Would have to drill out pocket hole plugs, dissolve the glue, and unscrew to replace the board.)
Is there any way to fix this? Hand plane it perhaps? (Newbie woodworker.) It's not awful, maybe a 1/4" gap. Enough to bug me though.

A:

At this point it's done, for all practical purposes.  If it were really important to straighten this thing out, and you were going to paint it, you could plow a dado, insert a Guitar Truss Rod , and Bondo over it.  Don't laugh - they've helped us out of a couple of jams over the years.  We even have a few made up, just in case. But it's a pretty extreme fix, and doesn't sounds like you need it. 
You can more than likely cheat the hinges in some way to compensate for that little bit of warp. Depending on what type of hinges you used, you could twist a leaf, or bend the pin, or simply push one hinge a bit out of alignment with the other.  
If you could post what type of hinges you will be using, I'm sure several folks have tricks for cheating those hinges.
