Q:

For a kid's balance beam, which way should the grain face?

I made a wood balance beam for my daughter out of a fir 4x4 and some compression joints. Which direction should the grain be? Should the grain run parallel or perpendicular to the top of the beam?

A:

You want the grain/growth lines to be oriented vertically to maximize strength.  Most 4x4 posts will have curved annual growth lines.  Choose the orientation that is most vertical.  As a caution, note that professional balance beams are made from laminated wood and are much deeper than the 3 1/2" in a 4x4 post.  If your daughter is going to do any gymnastics on the beam a pine 4x4 may not be rigid enough especially if you make it any longer than 8'.
