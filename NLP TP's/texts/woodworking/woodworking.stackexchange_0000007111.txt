Q:

Splotchy staining on cherry veneer

Based on a 14 x 17" sample the contractor showed us, we bought cherry veneer bathroom cabinets with a cinnamon finish. 
Most (not all) of the drawers have splotchy staining (see photo). The splotchiness bothers us, but we are also not wood experts. Is the splotchiness due to expected variations that will/should be less noticeable as the wood darkens; or should we raise a concern with the contractor?
Note: We know the question seems to straddle this site and the DIY site. We posted it here because the question is wood-focused. If the moderators think it's more appropriate at DIY (or even some other site), then please migrate the question.

Oh goodness! Your cherry is blotching when stained? Heavens!
Sorry. Couldn't resist. Cherry is famous for blotching. Here's a decent article.
As it states, the usual approach is a wash coat of sealer (such as shellac) to make the absorption more uniform. Your contractor didn't do this, as it would add another step (and more cost) to their finishing process. And even then, blotching can still happen, although it will be reduced. Particularly if your cabinets are not exposed to sunlight, the blotchiness will diminish with age but not disappear.
