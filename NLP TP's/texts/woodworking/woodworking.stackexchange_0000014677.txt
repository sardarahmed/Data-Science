Q:

Should I use pocket holes or I should screw through -I am building an adjustable shelf using 5/8" melamine (96"x20"x12")

I am building an adjustable shelf 96"x20"x12" (hxwxd) adjacent on both sides to an inside wall corner, anchored to wall
Since this will be kind of tall and slim I will probably install a fixed shelf board in the middle to make it more stable and rigid.
This shelf will will be used to store boxes with smaller tools, larger tools etc etc
It will sit 1" away from each wall because there is electrical conduit on that wall. Since it is at the top I might chose to cut the side panels to allow them to get closer to the wall and eliminate the gap at the back.
As mentioned I will use some furniture anti tip brackets to make sure is is secured
What type of screws can I use to build the frame of the shelf?

A:

Use screws designed for use in particle board.
They have a coarse thread and deeper gullets (greater difference between the diameter of the thread and diameter of the shank) to hold better in the grainlessness of particle board.
"Regular" wood screws will work, but they won't hold as well and will be more likely to tear out with movement of the wood. (Not expansion, there's no appreciable amount of expansion in particle board, but with movement of piece against piece, like when you bump into it.)
