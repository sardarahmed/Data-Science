Q:

Not sure how to successfully drill these pieces

I'm trying to drill two pieces of wood similar to the angled pieces marked in blue. However, I'm not sure how to clamp these and can't drill them straight without the wood slipping. What's the best way to join them? 

A:

There are a variety of strategies that can get you drilling the direction you would like. One of the simpler methods requiring no special jig or prep is to begin by drilling a shallow starter hole perpendicular to the surface where you want your final bore to begin. Once a starter hole is drilled, simply reposition the drill and drill in the direction you want to go. You can dial in the accuracy by off-setting the location of the starter hole. You may want to practice in some scrap material to get the feel of where your bores will go in relation to the angles and drill size you are using. Sometimes, using a larger drill for the starter can be helpful but most of the time the same size bit can be used. With practice, one can achieve a high degree of accuracy and repeatability applying this method. 
This is essentially a rough approximation of carefully chiseling an alcove in the material resulting in a flat surface perpendicular to the direction of your final desired bore. 
Creating a custom pocket hole jig would be an example of a more labor intensive process up front but may be worthwhile if highly repeatable precision is desired. In that case, efficient and accurate positioning and clamping present their own learning curves.
