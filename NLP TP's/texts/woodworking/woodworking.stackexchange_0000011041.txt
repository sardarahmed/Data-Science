Q:

How can I create surface defects intentionally?

My master's thesis is based on tactile detection of surface defects in wood surfaces. I am using standardized 20cm disks made from different wood species as samples for my system.
The control samples are trivial to make by just sanding a defect-free piece of wood properly. The defect samples are where I'm facing issues:
Given that tools are (hopefully) designed to minimize defects as much as possible, it's not exactly easy to produce defects in a controlled and intentional way. Some types are easy (Scratches, dents caused by impacts, over-agressive sanding, etc.), but others like torn/fuzzy/raised grain, chip marks, knife burn, saw marks, aren't.
How can I intentionally produce surface defects (without neglecting safety)?
Intentionally damaging (inexpensive) cutting tools like saw blades is an option.

A:

Raised grain is easy - get the wood wet.
Torn can be pretty easy, too - plane or chisel it in the wrong direction or with a dull tool.
I'm not sure what "chip marks" are, exactly, but if you plane into the end-grain (start the plane with the blade off the wood, then dig into it) of the wood, you're likely to tear out a chunk, which may be what you're after.
Saw marks can be fairly easy - assuming you're slicing your "disks" off of a long rod, cut part of the way through, then move the piece slightly while continuing the cut. This is potentially dangerous as you can cause the blade to bind which could grab your wood and throw it. Be extremely careful doing this.
I'm not exactly sure what "knife burn" is, either, but if you use a dull saw or router bit you're likely to burn the wood. I'm not sure that you'd be able to feel the difference (though you can see it), I guess that's part of the research, eh?
