Q:

Are the wheels of a bandsaw exactly the nominal diameter?

I recently bought a used bandsaw from a neighbor (AMT 14" model 4113).  It needs new tires, but when I went to measure their width/thickness, I discovered that the wheels are only 13 3/4" in diameter (with the tires on).
Is this the typical size of a 14" bandsaw's wheels?  If I buy 14" tires, will they fit, or do I have to buy 13 3/4" tires?

A:

Bandsaw tires are generally sold in 2" increments corresponding to the nominal size of the bandsaw wheels. As the comments indicate, there is some elasticity, so neither the wheels nor tires need to be exact. nominal 14" tires go on nominal 14" wheels.
