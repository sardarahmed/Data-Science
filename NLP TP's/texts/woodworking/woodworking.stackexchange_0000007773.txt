Q:

Vacuum pre-filter for large objects

My vacuum setup currently consists of a 5hp shop vac (orange) with 2.5” hoses, a hepa filter, a cyclone pre-filter (dust deputy), and automatic power. 
It works very well except the hose often clogs with large objects, particularly long thin slivers of material from the table saw or the occasional bit of masking tape. The problem points seem to be the joint with the cyclone filter and the outlet from the table saw, as well as inside the cyclone itself (when a very long object greater than the diameter of the filter tries to enter and hits the opposite wall). Once an object gets stuck, smaller things tend to get hung up on it until it becomes clogged enough for me to notice.
Is there a solution to this? I don’t mind things getting hung up on the tool sides but the cyclone joint is kind of a pain. Is there some additional type of pre-filter system that can drop out extremely large objects that make it through the hose before they reach the cyclone, or some other solution? I can’t really increase my hose diameter; I don’t have the budget or the space for it and the majority of my tools (and the cyclone) are 2.5” or smaller anyways.
I’d post pics but I don’t have any right now.

A:

You can put a rudimentary filter at the tool side. 
For filtering out just the super large chunks it is enough that the air changes direction and cannot pull the those along. 
An airtight box with just an inlet and outlet should be enough for that. If you want you can put a wire screen in there to truly catch those chunks.
