Q:

Using BLO on a Base Used for an Electrical Lamp

I'm just finishing a wooden lamp as a base for an electrical lamp (using a porcelain bulb socket)
Do I need to worry about the flammability of the stain/wood?
Assuming I keep the electrical components in a neat and unexposed.
This is my first ever wood working project so I'm rather clueless (even after using my best friend Google ;) )
Many Thanks!!

A:

Thete are lots of lamps out there with wooden bases with various finishes.If the wiring isn't bad, and the socket is approved for use in contact with wood (most are, if mounted correctly) and you let there be enough airflow around the bulb for it to cool itself, this really shouldn't be a problem.
