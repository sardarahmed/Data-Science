Q:

Honey locust disc cracking

I have a 4 inch cookie of honey locust I purchased from a local dealer. Kiln dried and moisture between 8 and 10.
I had done all the crack filling on this piece and sanding it up.
Left it in garage for a few weeks as life gets hectic.
Came out to find new and large cracks, some straight through.
Is this the nature of the wood? How to stop this from cracking further?

A:

Discs of most woods will crack. When first cut you can treat discs with PEG to limit cracking.
Your wood was probably not at EMC (equilibrium moisture content). Moisture meters either

check wood at one spot (where you put the pins), or
check the average MC (moisture content) across a section using resistance. Taking samples from all parts of the wood is the only surefire method.
