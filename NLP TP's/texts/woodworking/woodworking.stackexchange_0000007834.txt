Q:

Metal framed wood table, will expansion be an issue?

I've got a good deal of wood scraps from other projects laying about and am thinking of making a colored epoxy table, something like this: 

Where the blocks are my scraps, the area between will be filled with epoxy, and the outside would be steel or iron (going for a modern industrial look). 
I usually don't frame tables, but then again, this is the first one where I'd be filling it with epoxy as opposed to running full length boards. So, the question is: with this type of build, do I need to be concerned about wood expansion and the wood possibly bowing up? 
Thanks!

A:

I would be quite concerned with wood movement in this design.  You will be bonding epoxy (which doesn't move seasonally) directly to the end grain of wood.  Since the wood will be expanding and contracting but the epoxy won't I would expect one or the other (or both) to crack or buckle.
I would suggest either redesigning the piece so that the epoxy is bonded to the sides of the boards instead of the ends or decoupling the center section from the boards (i.e. change it to a piece of glass resting on rabbets on the end of each board.)
Also, you will need to make sure that there is some mechanism for expansion of the wood in the metal frame.  For example, the frame could be made of C-channel with the open side facing in and the boards float inside it with some room for expansion.
