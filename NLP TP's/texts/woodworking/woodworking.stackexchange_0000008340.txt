Q:

How hard is it to replace a hollow-core door with a solid one?

The pantry door in my kitchen is a hollow-core door. There's quite a lot of wasted space between the door and the existing shelves, that I'd like to utilize by hanging full-width, full-height, 8"-10' shelves on the inside surface of the door.
The plans I've worked up suggest that the shelves, when full, would be supporting quite a bit of weight, and I'm concerned that the hollow-core door won't be able to support it adequately.
How difficult is it to replace one door with another using the existing frame/jams, etc. It seems pretty straight-forward, but something tells me that there's more to it than I imagine... 
Is this something that is worth doing, or is it a rabbit-hole of pain and disappointment?

A:

I've replaced about half-a-dozen doors over time.  The old ones were mostly very tatty, old, solid-wood doors (rather than hollow-core), but that doesn't matter.
The important point is that the new doors are solid wood.  This is because the new doors need to fit (exactly) the existing door-frames ... and it is a lot easier to cut 10mm off the side of a solid door than it is with a hollow-core.  Obviously measure the door frame carefully (and if you have an old house, don't assume it is rectangular!)
Replacing the doors themselves is relatively straightforward.  The thing I would be more worried about, is the jams: can they take the load?  You might also want to consider having more and bigger hinges to take the load - but you'll probably want new hinges anyway.
I'd go for it!
