Q:

How do I make a drill hole the same depth every time?

My drill press doesn't have a "stop".
How do I make a drill hole the same depth every time?

A:

Ashler's answer is the simplest and cheapest way to get holes the same depth.  But as an extra there are bit collars that can be put on the bits which will enforce exact depth stops.  

A:

A lot of people drill a hole through a suitable length of wood dowel (or small square cross section) and use that as a stop-collar on the drill.

Example
You can also just use an external chunk of wood

Example
One benefit of both these is you don't need an Allen key and can very quickly swap back and forth between two or more different depths (useful for e.g. dowelling)
Unlike some pieces of tape or rubber/plastic grommets, they can't be pushed out of position by overenthusiastic pressure.

A:

The simplest means is to place a tab of masking tape on the drill bit at the desired depth.  When the spinning tab lowers to the surface of the wood and sweeps away the wood chips, stop.
