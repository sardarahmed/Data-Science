Q:

Percent error of a cut

I apologize ahead of time as I am brand new to wood cutting and do not know a lot.
I am cutting wood that is supposed to be 14 inches long lets say, but when I cut it, I mess up slightly and it winds up being 13 and 15/16th or 13 and 7/8th of an inch. Are these pieces of wood still good to use or is a redo necessary?
Thank you!

A:

If it is a picnic table no problem if it is in the face of a fancy hutch maybe, maybe not. Sometimes the project can be modified to fit, sometimes it really does not matter, and I have had to scrap a large part from expensive wood for a small error (ouch). Sorry for the clear as mud answer.
Anyone have a good board stretcher for sale? (no such thing)
One of the skills you will pick up on along the way is the ability to hide your mistakes or turn them into features.
