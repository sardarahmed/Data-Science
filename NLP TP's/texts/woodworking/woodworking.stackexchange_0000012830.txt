Q:

Do modern glues make miter lock joints obsolete?

The idea of the miter lock was to be able to create long rectangular tubes of wood that would have strong, perfect joints. The challenge of using miter lock bits was significant though. Adjustment of the miterlock has to be perfect and the wood must be very consistent in thickness, etc. Also, miter locks have a significant surface area, so a lot of wood gets removed when routing out a miter lock joint with all the consequent high forces and pressures.
I am wondering if all of this is now irrelevant, now that modern glues are "stronger than the wood itself"? Is there any advantage to use this complex joint over just gluing up a normal 45-degree mitre joint?

A:

Joinery is not all about the strength of the joint, though it is certainly an aspect. A large part of what makes woodworking satisfying is the beauty of the construction.
Aside from that, the structure of a joint is important to the strength of the joint as well, because it influences how the glue bonds the pieces together, particularly with relation to grain ... end-grain to end-grain joints tend to be weaker, or at least require more glue as much will be pulled into the grain itself. I typically reinforce a simple miter joint with a biscuit, dowel, or even pocket holes, because even with glue, the joint itself is weak. By using a miter lock joint or similar modification to the profile of the joint, you are adding more edge/face grain for the bonding, which tends to be superior. This is ignoring the obvious benefit of the interlocking members providing a better union.
