Q:

Glue mistake and redo

I glued my teak joint with wood glue and after 4 hours I realised I had the parts mixed up so I had to pry it apart again.
The glue I used was Evo-stick interior wood glue. It was white. The parts didn't splinter when I opened the join and some of the glue was still wet in the center. Luckily I had made a poor job of flattening the surface and didn't clamp them tight enough. After coming back I scraped the glue and some wood off the surface with a sharp chisel and glued again.
Can I just re-glue now or do I need to treat the surface before trying again?

A:

generally for best results in using wood glue, it is highly recommended to clean off all the old glue before hand.
