Q:

Tool Identification

I picked this up at a yard sale for ~$2 about 6 months ago and have been trying to figure out what the heck it is.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

UPDATE 4/26/20 - added more pictures.
And yes, it does pivot - there seems to be a spring of some sort in there.

UPDATE 4/27/20
While there doesn't seem to be complete understanding, it sounds like a double marking gauge of some sort. I appreciate everyone's assistance on this! I'll have to figure out if it's worth me trying to understand it, or repurpose the pieces into something more interesting!

A:

I'm going to call that a double marking gauge. 
Double because it looks like you can separate the two rods and set them independently. (Useful for marking independent sides of a mortise, for example.)
