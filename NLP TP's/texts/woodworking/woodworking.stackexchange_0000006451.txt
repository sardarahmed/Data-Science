Q:

Walnut drawer sides: Is it wise to glue-in the plywood base?

I'm making 6 large drawers (514x720x150mm) for the bedroom, with 20mm thick walnut sides (didn't realise quite how expensive that timber would be...!  ) and 8mm plywood for the base.
The drawer sides are joined with mitre lock joints done with a router, and the base will fit into 8mm deep dados in the drawer sides.
I'd like to glue the base into the dado grooves, and I realise that plywood is dimensionally stable, what I'm not sure if is whether  walnut is sufficiently stable for me to glue the base in snugly without fear of damage from expansion/contraction? 

A:

you should be fine. the drawer sides are thin enough that expansion/contraction of them is not an issue. furthermore, although you are pinning the dimension of the drawer from the inside, the outside is free to expand - but again, it's such a small amount. solid drawer bottoms are not glued in because the bottom panel is wide enough for expansion/contraction to be a major issue.
