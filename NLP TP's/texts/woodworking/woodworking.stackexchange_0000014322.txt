Q:

1/4" straight router bit 6mm ply

I'm making a panel and have imperial router bits. I can only get ply in metric. If I buy 6mm ply, will it create a resistance fit with a slot cut using a 1/4" bit. Not sure if the 0.35mm difference will be problematic or not.

A:

You can't guarantee your router bit will leave a fairly exact 1/4" slot with a single pass1.
And you certainly have no guarantee the plywood is 6mm exactly, and/or is consistently 6mm â€” perhaps the majority of modern plywood is not consistent.
Loose fit? No biggie
Regardless of this, let's say you do end up with a slightly sloppy fit2, does this actually matter for your application? It doesn't in a few applications including cupboard backs, drawer bottoms and in frame-and-panel construction.
For the first two, if you do need or want the plywood firmly anchored this can be achieved easily:

using glue blocks;
brad-nailing the perimeter;
using framer's triangles or similar at the back/underneath;
glueing the ply into the slot with a gap-filling adhesive (epoxy being the most common).

For the third:

tacking the ply in with dabs of glue (pretty much any glue will do here);
using foam spacer blocks or balls in the slots removes play and silences any tendency for the panel to rattle.

Want a more exact fit?
As @AloysiusDefenestrate points out in the Comments, running a narrower router bit twice can give you the exact fit you want.

1 Unless you have measured the bit with a calipers to confirm the size it's probably safest to assume it isn't exactly 1/4". With non-premium router bits it's likely there is some variation bit to bit.
2 Bear in mind the reverse might be a possibility!
