Q:

What is the difference between a dutchman patch and a butterfly patch?

In How can I repair a split in a board?, the accepted response suggests a "dutchman patch," but I'm getting mixed messages from various sources. Some show a dutchman as being the removal of damaged material and insertion of a patch of the same size. Others seem to specifically be a bowtie/butterfly shape reinforcing a crack in wood. 
For instance, both of these images are being referred to as dutchman patches:

So which is it? Is there a difference between a dutchman patch and a butterfly patch? Is this just a case of the same phrase meaning two different things?
Is a dutchman a general term and the buttefly specifically that shape of dutchman?

Yes and no. A Dutchman can be the shape of a butterfly (also called a bowtie) as well as many other shapes. 
But a butterfly in modern usage typically means a wooden fixing to secure or stabilise a crack.
This is yet another example (of many!) of terminology being used loosely or irregularly in woodworking.
Note: Dutchmen patches are usually thin, and can in fact be made from veneer, butterflies or bowties are typically thick because of their structural requirement.

A dutchman patch is basically using wood to fill a void larger than can be done with filler alone.  A butterfly patch is typically used to prevent a check from getting larger, or to reinforce a joint.  You could consider a butterfly patch to be a specific case of a more general dutchman patch.
