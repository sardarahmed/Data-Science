Q:

Filling pores on a turned bowl while remaining foodsafe/organic?

I recently received some really helpful answers to a previous question I had that exposed a big gap in my understanding of turning.
This answer mentions "filling the pores" of a walnut bowl as a solution (the only solution?) to the roughness that can be felt on the two end-grain sides of the bowl, even after sanding from 100 to 600 and finishing with 0000 steel wool.
I finish all my bowls in organic foodsafe beeswax and mineral oil, and for (perhaps stubborn) aesthetic reasons, I'd really like to avoid acrylic, poly, or other non-natural, non-foodsafe sealers.
Is this impossible? What are the best ways to make a fully smooth bowl while keeping it foodsafe and organic?
Thanks in advance for any tips you can provide!

A:

You can try making a paste of wood glue and sawdust to full the grain. This website, along with the glue bottle, cites that Titebond III is food-safe, so it should work for your purposes.
