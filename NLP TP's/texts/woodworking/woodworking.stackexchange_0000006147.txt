Q:

Imperial or metric?

I'm literally just starting out in woodworking. I notice that even many British woodworkers online are talking in inches, or "a couple of thou'" when describing measurements etc. I also notice that things like 1, 2, 3 blocks don't seem to come in metric sizes, and that lumber is still offered in 2x4" and plywood is "half-inch" or "quarter-inch" (although in Europe metric units have to be displayed on product labels as well).
I know that inches are divided into 8ths/16ths (though I've never measured a thousandth of an inch - that seems infinitesimal!) but haven't ever really worked with them.
Given I'm a child of the metric age, are there any concrete reasons to use imperial measurements in my woodworking?

A:

If imperial measurements were not so ingrained in my mind, I'd do everything in metric.  Quite a few of the tools here in the US that are labeled as "inch" are actually metric.  A few of my 1/2" chisels are actually 13mm - slightly larger than one would expect, which can cause difficulties.
My favorite tape measure is metric only - Talmeter.  As to 1-2-3 blocks, the metric versions are 25-50-75 blocks, and they are readily available on Amazon.  
Finally, absolute measurements are not as important when making non-production builds.  What is more important is that the parts fit relative to each other.  I typically will use a tape measure to get my initial sizes, but from then on I will use a story stick so I can get consistent sizing.  
So if you "think" in metric, use metric.  Hold your hands 165mm apart.  If you know about how far that is, then you are thinking in metric.  If you have to convert that to inches, then you don't.
