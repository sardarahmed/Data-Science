Q:

Can this be a very simple cross cut sled with replaceable zero inserts?

I am trying to reuse an older crosscut sled.
I will have problems with using the old cut for the blade so I googled for a solution and I came across a couple of complicated designs with replaceable zero inserts. Those would add another piece of plywood on top of the one that makes the sled base.
Since my fences are very solid (both front and back) I could practically cut out the piece of plywood 1" or 2" to the left and right of the blade cut and install a replacement screwed to the fence as shown below. Wood nuts will be installed int the fence and then I will use screws to attach a new insert every time I need a new one like below and then make a new cut. I wonder what I am missing since I never seen this simple design

A:

This will work. This is how mine works. People like to make things very complicated... a lot of people like making jigs more than anything else.
