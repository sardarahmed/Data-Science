Q:

Dice Tray Storage

I want to build some shelves to store trays of dice. The trays are 13.7" x 8.6" x 1.37" and are ~4.5 lbs when completely filled with dice.
What kind of lifespan can I expect if I use 1/4" pine plywood for the shelves and 3/4" pine plywood for the outer box with pocket holes?
Here's my design as I would try to build it today:

A:

The devil is in the details, but plywood is so stable that as this design will probably work for years and years if kept indoors and not used as part of an AD&D wet bar.
I question that each tray is 5lbs, though. But whatever mass is present is spread over the entire surface, so whatever.
You will still have to allow for plywood to expand and contract as relative humidity changes. But this will only happen along the width as the plies swell a little.
Assuming you are using butt-joints for the box, as long as you prepare and clamp the glued faces appropriately, modern PVA glue joints will be stronger than the material around it.
