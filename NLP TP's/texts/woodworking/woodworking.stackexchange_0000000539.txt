Q:

What is the purpose of a saw nib?

Saw nibs have been present for hundreds of years. What is their purpose?

A:

well, there may be more to it that you'd think.  And definitely an interesting piece of trivia.
There are 2 types of nibs, either as something sticking out like on the picture in the question, or as a little notch.
There are multiple answers, ranging from:

nothing, that's just for decoration
this can be used to attach a blade guard (so you tie the strings around it and it won't slip)
you can use it as a pivot point against a nail to draw a circle (you lock your pencil in between 2 teeth).

A:

The explanation I'd always seen was that this "single tooth" could be used to create an initial nick in the wood to start the cut at a fairly precise place. Without that nick, the first cut has a tendency to slip sideways a bit, losing accuracy.
You could create the guide nick in other ways -- with a chisel,  for example -- perhaps more accurately.  But building it into the saw guarantees you'll have it when you need it.
I can't prove that was the original intent. But I can say that it seems to work when used that way. It's more a carpentry solution than a cabinetry solution,  though, since it risks a bit more tear-out.

A:

A trollish question indeed ;) My favorite answer has been, "So you can recognize an old saw at garage sales," but the most well referenced sources I've found indicate that it was originally placed as a decoration and just stuck.
