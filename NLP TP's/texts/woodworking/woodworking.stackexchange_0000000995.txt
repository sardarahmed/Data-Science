Q:

Why thread both ends of a pipe for a pipe clamp?

I recently purchased Pony Pipe Clamps (#50 - 3/4 pipe).  In the instructions, they suggest to mount them on a pipe threaded at both ends.  My pipes are threaded at one end only.  I'm wondering what are the advantages to thread both ends.  Is this suggested just so that the movable part of the clamp doesn't slide off the pipe? (With the coil-spring stop installed)

A:

You can extend the reach of pipe clamps by connecting two together with a coupling. That requires that those ends be threaded.. Most people cant thread them at home, so it's better to get them threaded at the store up front so you don't have to make two trips :-) 

A:

Although the threaded ends can be used to extend the pipe to a longer length, the threads are used to hold a part that comes with the pony clamps. It is a piece of coiled wire that fits the threads so the sliding potion of the clamp does not come completely off the end.
