Q:

Router bit without shank

I inherited a router and stand from a neighbor who passed away. Nice router and stand, so I'd like to use it. It has an older model Sears router (315.17380) with a fixed shank.
The bits are changed by unscrewing the bolt, so the bits themselves don't have a shank. It came with one bit. I searched the internet and can't find that style of bit. They only come with shanks.
Are these types of router bits still sold?

A:

I believe you may be mistaken,  I see a collet nut and presumably collet nuts can be turned. It is very possible that the shank of the bit in it is stuck after many years.
I found the manual online  Here.
Page 3 shows the bit changing instructions.

I owned one, same model i believe, and it definitely had a collet and i could change bits.
Here is a YouTube video of a similar model being resurrected.
