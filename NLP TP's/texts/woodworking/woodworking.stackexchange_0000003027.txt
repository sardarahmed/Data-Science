Q:

What methods could I use to round the edge of a thick board?

Let's say I want to round the edge of a long board, something like the front and back of the desk I attached. 

What techniques can I use to achieve this? It's obviously too wide to use a router (unless you have a 12-inch round over...), and it's much too long to use a bandsaw. How could you do this?

A:

The easy way: Bending plywood over supports, veneered.
The hard and expensive way: Start with angled tablesaw rip-cuts to approximate the shape, refine with planes to create more/smaller facets, sand to final roundness.

A:

This sort of bullnose profile is very easily achieved by hand planing, followed by scraping and/or sanding. The bulk of the wood could be removed using a spokeshave, but all the work could be done with one or more planes if required. 
After marking your profiles on both ends you begin work by chamfering the corners to take off the bulk of the excess wood, then take the resulting corners off, then take those corners off and so forth until you're nearly at your marked lines. Then you scrape or sand to the final round profile.
