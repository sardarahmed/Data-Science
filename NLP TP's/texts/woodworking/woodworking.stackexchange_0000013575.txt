Q:

Veneer on pine wood lumber 25CM

I want to glue veneer on pine lumber wood 25x25 cm, is that possible? or the veneer will not hold?

A:

Why wouldn't it?
Marquetry has been done for centuries and involves gluing hundreds or thousands of tiny slivers of veneer pieces to a larger surface to make a pattern.
There's no reason a single larger sheet of veneer wouldn't stick to a 25 x 25cm piece of pine. The key is in the prep work, not in the size of the material.
