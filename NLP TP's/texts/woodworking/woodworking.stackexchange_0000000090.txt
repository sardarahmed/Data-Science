Q:

What are reliable ways of flattening out warped wood?

I know about cutting a line on the concave side to loosen it, and then gluing in strips of wood once flat, and I know of using water on one side and then laying things on top to help it dry flat. Are there any other ways of making warped wood flat again?

A:

Common wisdom is that if you have access to a jointer and planer, you will joint the board on the cupped side to flatten it, then use the planer to produce a smooth edge on the opposite side.  If you don't have a jointer, there are some jigs available that can attempt to replicate a jointer's function on just a planer.  If you don't have a planer, well, you'll be stuck using a hand plane to shave the warped portions off.
One thing I failed to mention is that one can also use a router to flatten a board; it seems a bit like a kludge but I wager many people have used this technique in absence of a jointer or planer.  The Wood Whisperer has a good video about this: TWW 174 on YouTube
