Q:

How to stop cat shelf split

I have two cat shelfs (brought, sorry).  The problem that i have is that they are sometimes quite weak.  
How do I make them more secure?  What do I need to do?
This is the bottom of the shelf
 
This the actual split from the top of the shelf
 

A:

That's a cantilever design

It looks like someone (or somecat) has put more weight on it than it is capable of supporting (was it located somewhere a child might have been tempted to try it?)
After repairing the split (disassemble, glue and screws or clamp, reassemble) I would add some bracing struts to the underside, secured to the wall.
