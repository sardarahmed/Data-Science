Q:

What is the difference between a worm and sidewinder drive circular saws?

I didn't even know this was a thing. Then I read comments in this question

Worm drive saws are long and unwieldy for all but the burliest of men. I found them a real pain to work with. A Makita is a nicely-balanced tool and will last a woodworker 200 years. We used them like rental cars for years with nothing more than motor brush and cord changes.

I aspire to be a burly man on occasion. What is the difference between a worm drive and sidewinder drive circular saws? Do each lend better to certain applications? What do I need to know to use each properly? Are there other types where modern circular saws are concerned?

A:

I agree with what Steven has to say. Unless you're routinely cutting 2" thick oak or hickory slabs, a modern direct-drive saw is likely more appropriate. Equipped with a sharp, suitable blade it will cut nearly any wood workpiece with ease.
To clarify my quote in the question, worm-drive saws should be considered two-handed tools for most folks. That usually means that your workpiece should be clamped or secured to keep it stable. Direct-drive saws are more easily operated with one hand.

A:

Worm drives use a worm gear to connect the motor to the blade. Generally speaking, they are more powerful than direct drive saws where the motor drives the blade directly. 
They are also larger, heavier and more expensive than direct drive models. 
Think of them like a cabinet table saw versus a contractor table saw. Both will get the job done but one will last longer and be up to tougher tasks. 
A lot of contractors prefer direct drive since they are lighter and smaller.
