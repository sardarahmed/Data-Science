How to cut wood to square it up when both sides are not cut straight?

How do I take a piece of plywood that is not square and make it square? I'm new at woodworking.
The sides are not straight which I can tell by just looking at them How do I cut the wood to make it straight when both sides are not straight cuts?

A:

I've used this method before to straighten boards.  You make a jig like the one shown.  The jig is used as a reference point to straighten the uneven board.
