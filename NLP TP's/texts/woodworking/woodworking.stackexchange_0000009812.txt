Q:

True up small piece of wood

I want to mount this piece of plywood in such a way that it is reasonably removable.

I first need to true up the edges of the wood and that is difficult because of its small size, 8" x 12".
I have a table saw, circular saw, and reciprocating saw.
I would like to avoid the table saw because of its weight and bulk and because it is not on a stand.
How can I true up the wood?

A:

Given your available power tools (and the stand-less state of the table saw which would be appropriate if it were set up properly and if you were comfortable using it), I would suggest using hand tools.
Use an 8-inch or larger carpenter's triangle with one edge flat against one of the long sides to draw a squared up edge along each of the 8-inch sides.  Then secure the wood in 
a workbench vice (or clamped off the edge of a sturdy table) to hold it motionless while you follow each of those drawn lines with a sharp hand saw.
Once those two 8-inch sides are square to one of the 12-inch sides, use a tape measure to find a point equally distant down each of those 8-inch sides.  Use a straight edge and a pencil to connect those two points, then re-secure the vice/clamp and reapply the hand saw.
When you are done, sand all cut surfaces to the desired smoothness.
