Q:

What is this tool with a metal strip mounted perpendicular to a wooden handle?

What is this tool?  It is 9 inches long, with a straight wooden handle and a flat wooden head with one rounded and one flat edge.  In the flat edge of the wooden head is a thick strip of metal which protrudes by half its width, offering a blunt/flat edge.
It feels sufficiently strong and has the right sort of heft that conceivably it could be used to strike something using the metal part â€” perhaps some sort of soft sheet metal like lead flashing.

A:

This is a veneer hammer.
The hammer part of the name is confusing as these aren't a percussion tool, they are instead pressing tools. They are used in traditional veneer work (using hot protein-based glue) to firmly press the veneer down onto the substrate as the glue cools and gels, a process called "hammer veneering".
This one could be a commercially made version or a user-made tool, not sure if it's possible to tell as if you go back far enough the shape and materials could be the same, and the quality of fit and finish could be indistinguishable. It does however look very much like the pattern suggested by Robert Wearing in his books on jig/tool/accessories making (which could originally have come from the pages of The Woodworker magazine).
