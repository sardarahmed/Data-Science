Q:

What are the metal inserts which accept adjustable screws called?

I was watching a woodworking YouTube video which showed a metal insert being permanently hammered into a pre-drilled hole at the bottom of a table leg.   A large machine screw with a padded head was then threaded through an opening in the insert and into the pre-drilled hole.  The result provided an adjustable foot for the leg which could extend the length of the total leg by up to about an inch.
Here is a bad drawing of what the insert looked like in the video...

My question is what are these inserts called?  I want to order some but don't know what to look for.

A:

The ones in your sketch are T-nuts, and are typically hammered into the wood. The prongs bite into the wood, keeping it from moving, and the inside of the barrel is threaded to accept a bolt.
Another commonly-used piece of hardware that performs a similar function is a threaded insert. These have threads on the outside of the barrel as well, and are screwed into a hole in the wood. The threads on the outside bite into the wood, keeping it from moving, although some people will also put a small amount of epoxy in there, too.
From what I can see, there's not a whole lot different about them other than the size. T-nuts require a bit more wood around the hole to provide a place for the prongs to bite into. Thus, threaded inserts can be used on smaller pieces of wood than T-nuts (e.g. end or edge grain of 3/4" or 4/4 material). Threaded inserts seem to be more common in knockdown furniture whereas T-nuts seem to be more common in "mechanical" builds (knobs, jigs, etc), although that's just based on me watching woodworking videos on youtube and nothing concrete.
