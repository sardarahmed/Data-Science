Q:

What are recommended angles for different wood-turning tools

I am going to make a jig for sharpening my lathe tools and I want to mark on the jig where each tool should be sharpened to. Like the roughing gouge to the skew and stuff. So for each of these different tools, what angle should they be at? If I need to list the different tools then ask. Otherwise I mostly want to know for the 6 (or so) main types. The more covered the better! The idea is to be sharpened on a bench grinder. 

A:

Don't obsess about the angle, work at sharpening what you have at the moment to a consistent grind and has no multiple facets. Consistency is the key and the wolverine type jigs are great for that. Cap,n Eddie Castalin has lots of good videos and shows how to make in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i9RDnJHz9g
Don't mark on the jig for each tool because as the are sharpened and get shorter that will change the angle, better to make a story stick for each tool if using the wolverine's cradle. The fingernail grind jig is set to 50mm for everything. Most factory grinds are not good and will need reshaping but that can come a bit later when you can sharpen consistently 
You can have the same size gouge with three different grinds depending where about's in the bowl you are cutting. Different woods may also require different angles depending on the wood and density. Brian Havens explains in this video on the skew https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhuEVVSkDtE
Both of these guys have very good videos with lots to learn.
