Q:

How to remove the upper wheel of a bandsaw?

I am in the process of restoring an old 14" bandsaw. I would like to disassemble it as much as possible and clean each part and remove as much saw dust and rust as I can. 
My first major step is to remove the upper wheel but it seems stuck. 

I have removed the nut in the middle and applied what I thought was a reasonable amount of force but it remains where it is. 
I don't want to apply to much force or bang it because I don't want to damage the bearing or the bolt. 
Any ideas on how I can remove the wheel?

A:

I attempted something along the lines of @Graphus's suggestion but could t get it to work. There wasn't enough space behind the wheel to put anything there to brace it. 
However, I banged the bolt lightly with a small hammer several times and noticed the wheel had moved a bit. I continued this for a while and pulled the wheel simultaneously and the wheel came off!
