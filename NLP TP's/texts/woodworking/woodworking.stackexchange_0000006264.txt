Q:

Ran into a few issues while staining my table top

My table top is made out of ash. There were a few spots that didn't take the stain well. Any suggestions on how to approach fixing these spots? This is my first build, so any help is appreciated!

A:

There was definitely some sort of surface contamination that prevented the stain from absorbing evenly. The only way to make it even, aside from painting, is to remove all of the current stain by planing, scraping, or sanding, and restain. The good news is, as long as you don't spill anything on the surface afterwards, you will have removed whatever contamination caused this.
