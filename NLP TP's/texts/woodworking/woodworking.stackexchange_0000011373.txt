Q:

Building a home climbing wall - questions

I'm building a freestanding climbing wall and have a few questions.
My design is two triangle frames built from 2x6 (green) with plywood panels (red) attached to the frame with 2x4 studs on the back (blue). The climbing wall is 40 degrees overhanging.

My main concern with the design is that all of the weight of the panels (~300lb) and climber (up to 200lb) goes onto the triangle frames, so they must be built absolutely solid. The small vertical panel at the bottom is not directly supporting any of the weight.
Questions:

Does this design look structurally sound, or are there any obvious things you would change?
The support legs will be mitered on the top, to attach to the angled frame. What is the best way to join the legs to the frame? Would pocket screws be sufficient?

Thank you and appreciate any advice.

A:

I haven't done any calculations but I would expect that the timber sizes you've selected will be fine for this application, as long as you use thick enough ply (definitely at least half-inch - if it were me I'd probably go for 3/4"). I believe a standard house-framing 2x4 can support 30,000lbs+ if it's loaded vertically. If something goes awry and it experiences lateral loading it will be much less.
As for the framing configuration, I would add more diagonal bracing, including some out to the sides of the longest uprights to brace against lateral loading. If possible I would tie the whole structure together with a base-plate (2x4 or 2x6) on the floor running laterally from base to base of your tallest uprights. Pocket screws etc, may be sufficient but I would suggest that using metal joist/truss plates (like those used when building roof trusses etc.) at the joints will make things more durable and reliable.
For a rough idea of what I'd do, see this image:
