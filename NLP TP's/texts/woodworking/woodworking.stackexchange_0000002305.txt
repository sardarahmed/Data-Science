Q:

Do I need to seal the ends of hardwood fence boards?

I am building a small horizontal fence.  The facing is batu and matches my front entryway deck. 
I put penofin penetrating oil on the fence boards. Do I need to seal the end of the hardwood fence boards?  With what?

A:

Yes you absolutely want to treat the ends of fence boards, even if they don't face upwards but especially if they do.
Typically you wouldn't use anything different on them, just coat with the same product you use to protect the faces of the boards. However, an additional coat (or two) is advisable since the end grain is very much more absorbent than the face grain. So much so in fact that prior to installation some people even go to the trouble of standing their fence boards (and posts) in a shallow pool of the protective coating, letting the end grain soak it up for some time (how long varies, at least 10-15 minutes but sometimes over an hour) so that it penetrates deeply. Note however that this can leave a tell-tale darker colouring at the ends of the boards or posts.
