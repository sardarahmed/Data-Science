Q:

What are the main categories of wood-turning tools?

For example, you have the spindle gouge:

A parting tool:

And several more. Walk into any wood-working store, and you'll probably see many of these sorts of tools, among others, that come in a great variety of lengths, dimensions, and shapes. Hence, I'm wondering if there's a broad categorization whereby tools in the same category are basically the same shape, just different sizes.

A:

There are gouges, which like you have displayed are made from curved pieces, bowl gouges, spindle gouges etc.
of course the parting tool is what it is, though there are different sizes.
skews - Angled on both front and back, can be straight, angled, or curved.
scrapers, often round nosed but many different shapes available
Then there are a whole host of texturing tools
a.Texturing and spiraling 
b.Chatter tools
As BrownRedHawk pointed out there are Hollowing tools as well, to make empty vessels and vases.
I'm sure there are plenty more too!
