Q:

Drill press, chuck falls down. How do I repair?

I have an old General International drill press (model 17-125M1 â€” so old that the GI website does not even show any results when I use their "Search" facility).
It works for the most part well, except that occasionally, the head (the chuck) just falls.  Usually not dangerous, but still an annoyance; plus, some times it ruins the wood piece.
When it falls, I simply push it up and slightly twist it counterclockwise, and it seems to just snap in place.   But it does not solve the problem  (in that it may continue to work at that moment, but at some point the problem will repeat).  For example, trying to use a countersink bit on a piece of plywood seems to be hopeless  (the chuck falls every single time).
How would I go about fixing this for good?  (I would like to try to fix it myself before getting it repaired, since I estimate the cost of getting it repaired may be too high)

A:

Does the chuck have a tapered shaft on its back end? That is called a Morse taper, developed for quick-change operations back in the day. The proper way to re-install it is to slide it into place, retract the 3 jaws into the chuck body, then use a hammer and a wood block to bang it upward sharply. The slight taper (about 2 degrees) helps it lock in. When they wanted to remove or change it, a light tap downward onto the chuck would pop it free.
