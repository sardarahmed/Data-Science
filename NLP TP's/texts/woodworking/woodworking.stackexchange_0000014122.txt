Q:

Drawer slides sticky with new drawer, common causes?

I am modifying a standalone cabinet to have a single, large drawer for holding garbage/recycling etc.

So far so good, however, when sliding the drawer in, the last 3-4 inches are pretty stiff/sticky. When operating the slides by themselves, there doesn't seem to be any trouble. They are overextension drawer slides from Rockler.
What are the most common causes for this sort of problem? My initial thought is that perhaps the mounting for the slides isn't perfectly square in the cabinet, but wanted to see what others thought before grabbing out the belt sander and trying to shave off a little, as it looks pretty good when I measure it.
I've also noticed that because of the width of the drawer, any sort of twisting exacerbates the issue, so I think I'll mount an additional pair of slides on the bottom to try and resist that twisting. However, even when I carefully slide the drawer directly in, it still binds.

Could be your cause since slides are not sticky alone and it is sticking when sliding fully in and not out @ full extension.

hard to measure this spacing accurately now, tape measure won't work.
Without large inside calipers I suggest using a gauge block. Make it exact fit at front of one slide to check spacing everywhere else. Should also be tight at back, front and back of other slider
But are sides of cabinet parallel? Maybe you did everything right and original cabinet is the villain!

That is normal but drawer maybe too narrow by small amount, or cabinet box sides are not parallel.
