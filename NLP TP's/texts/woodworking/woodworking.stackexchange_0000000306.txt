Q:

How to keep a hole saw together?

A few times I have purchased hole saw kits, there is one center piece and bunch of different sized saws every time I have tried to use one them by the second or third hole they are coming apart... It gets very frustrating.  Now I just buy one that is together and the size I need.  
It seems like having one center bit and several interchangeable hole sizes would be a great idea.  But I never get it to work in practice. Is there a secret to how to make them stay together, when you swap out pieces? 

A:

I have not seen the type of adjustable hole saw you describe, perhaps it's a regional thing (I'm on the west coast USA), but the type I'm familiar with have a spring loaded collar with "drive pins" that mate with holes in the bottom of the saw bit itself.
I would buy mandrel like this:

And a hole bit of the appropriate size which threads onto the collar screw:

After the bit is threaded on, the collar is snapped forward and the drive pins engage two of the four holes in the bit's base and prevent it from moving.
