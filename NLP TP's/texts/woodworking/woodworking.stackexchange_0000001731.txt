Q:

Is there a reference for how much weight a dowel rod can support before breaking?

I realize I am still in the beginning phase of designing this but I want to make a guitar wall hanger.  The design as is will be a simple base plate (either plywood or 1x dimensional lumber) with 2 dowel rods set into the base plate.  The guitar will hang on the dowels.
My question:
Since even the most expensive dowels are vastly cheaper than the even the cheapest guitars, I want the dowels to be strong enough to not shear off while the guitar is hanging.  SO, is there a reference for how much weight a dowel will hold when inserted into a board?  If it helps, I doubt the dowel on the finished piece will be longer than 3 inches sticking out from the wall, and the guitar will likely be inserted as far back on the dowels as possible.  As for how much weight, most weigh between 5 and 15 pounds, so let's budget for 20 pounds.

A:

While a 1/4" pair of dowels would likely be able to hold a guitar if left alone, a good twisting bump might break them off.  A 1/2" dowel would be plenty, and I think a 3/4" dowel (at 3-4") would be able to hold me without breaking (200 lbs.)  I would recommend 1/2" since that would be plenty strong and still small enough not to be obvious for your display.  
(I am assuming that most of these guitars are under 20 lbs. I think most are under 10 lbs.)
Found this one for dowels starting at 1.5" http://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/fnr/faculty/Eckelman/pdf/fpj57%285%2960-64.pdf
