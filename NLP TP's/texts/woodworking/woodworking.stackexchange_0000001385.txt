Q:

When making a box joint, how do I calculate the width of the board so that the teeth appear even?

I have made some box joints and thus far I've found it difficult to ensure that the teeth are evenly spaced; there's usually a pin that is cut down a bit.  Is there an equation or method of determining what the board's width should be?  Is it as simple as "always ensure board is a multiple of 2x the kerf of the dado set?

A:

Start by taking a multiple of the pin width, then add a little extra and cut all the slots/kerfs on all sides of the box. Once you're done, trim each side flush with the edge of a pin or slot. If you prefer, you can trim it to size after assembling and gluing it.
To guarantee that the teeth are evenly-spaced, use a jig. Popular Woodworking has a great article on how to build a box joint jig, and Fine Woodworking has a nice interactive demo illustrating how a box joint jig works.
Note that FWW calls it a finger joint jig because many people use the terms finger joint and box joint interchangeably, but personally I like to differentiate the right-angle joining version as a box joint and the straight joining version (e.g., to "lengthen" a board) as a finger joint since the straight joining version also often has tapered fingers.
