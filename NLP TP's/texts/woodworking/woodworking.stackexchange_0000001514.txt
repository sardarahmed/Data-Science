Q:

Carbide vs. high speed steel in jointer blade

I am replacing the cutters in my jointer and debating between high speed steel and carbide.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of HSS vs carbide jointer blades?

A:

All else being equal, anytime you have a choice between HSS (high speed steel) and carbide, you have to consider the tradeoffs.
High-Speed Steel
Advantages:

Cheaper up-front
Easier to sharpen
Less brittle

Disadvantages:

Potentially more expensive long-term (depending on application)
Wears faster (must be sharpened or replaced more frequently)

Carbide
Advantages:

Theoretically more cost-effective long-term (depending on application)
More wear-resistant (often praised as lasting 10x as long as HSS)

Disadvantages:

More expensive up-front
More difficult to sharpen
More brittle

When does it matter?
If you're looking at long jointer knives, high-speed steel is a proven material, and if you happen to completely trash your knives by running nails through your machine, the knives aren't very expensive to replace.
If you're looking at a cutterhead with segmented knives or inserts, carbide is a good choice because at worst you'll shatter the inserts that hit the nails.
