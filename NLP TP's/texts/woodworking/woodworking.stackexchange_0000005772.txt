Q:

My contractor sanded our plywood seating... Is there any way to fix the finish?

Just like the title says... any way to make this look less bad?

A:

Paint it, or pull off the hardwood edges, veneer over it with a new piece of veneer of the same species, and then apply new edges.
Depending on if you have multiple other matching finished end conditions, you could create a new trim detail that covers over the affected areas.
It looks like he face screwed, and then filled the holes with epoxy filler or possibly plugs of some sort, and then did an abysmal job of sanded them flush.
I work for a commercial millwork company, and if one of our installers did something like this, after firing them, we would replace that finished end panel completely.
