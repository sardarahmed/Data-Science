Q:

Minwax “One Coat Polyurethane” — does it work?

I stumbled across Minwax's One Coat Polyurethane on their website. It purports to built a finish equal to 3 coats of regular poly in a single application. I'm curious if anybody has used it and has any input/thoughts/feedback on how it works and whether it's worth trying out. 

A:

I just used it on a coffee table I built. The top consisted of 1x2s of different species with different stains. Used the One Coat on it. It went on smooth and same appearance across all the boards. It had a decent amount of working time where it didn't dry out by the time I got to the other side. I used the clear satin. Pretty matte, tiny bit of sheen but better than most. Virtually no brush strokes. Only thing is on some boards the grain was raised and the One Coat covered it, but went into the valleys a bit. Meaning it was not 100% smooth in that portion but couldn't tell until you were right against it. Still had full coverage and protected though. Took a screw driver to scrape a test piece. Held up as well as others. I plan on using it going forward on the pieces in my house.
