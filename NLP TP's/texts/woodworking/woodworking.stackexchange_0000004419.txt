Q:

Affixing a dowel to the bottom of a piece of board

I'm creating a desk from a file cabinet with a piece of wood atop it. I want to place a 1.25" dowel on the left side so that it is more stable, but I don't think running a screw through the top will suffice. 

Is there a piece like this photo, either square or round 

which I can glue to the board and then glue in the dowel???
I'm flummoxed.

A:

The joint you are probably thinking of is a mortise and tenon joint.  Such a joint is very strong, but strength is relative.  If you have the top securely fastened to the file cabinet, and only need the dowel as a leg to keep it from tipping, a 1 1/4" dowel would have enough strength for that purpose, but fastening it to a relatively thin tabletop would be the weak link.
If the leg never had any lateral stress applied to it, and was always in compression between the tabletop and the floor, almost anything that held it in place would suffice.  Unfortunately, you cannot assume that the leg will never get knocked or kicked, an so you need to provide some support to prevent lateral movement.
If you look at a table, the top is affixed to an apron consisting of boards perpendicular to the top, and the legs are fastened to this apron.  The problem is, it is hard to attach a round dowel to a flat apron.  Usually this is solved by having the leg be squared at the top allowing fasteners to connect to the apron in two dimensions.  

Instead of a dowel, you could buy a single table leg, then attach it to the desk bottom somewhat like this.

Using a simple table leg similar to this one below available at Home Depot.
