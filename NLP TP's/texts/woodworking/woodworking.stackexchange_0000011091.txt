Q:

What size is the T-track for Metabo Bs 0633 bandsaw table?

Problem: I recently bought a used Metabo Bs 0633 bandsaw but cannot find any marketed t-track attachment for the t-tracks running parallel to the blade.
Question: What is the name or sizing category for a t-track slider for this bandsaw?
Context: I am looking for sliders or bolts or something like that to slide in the track for attachment of jigs and things like this:

Photo of the t-track lower part: ~19 mm (~3/4")

Photo of the t-track upper part: ~12 mm (~1/2")

Photo of the t-track cross section: ~7 mm total depth (~1/4")

A:

This is not a type of T-track, but a solution I have found is to file off the top and square the edges of the top of a M8 carriage bolt. It fits well enough for clamping operations. It has more slop than you may need for proper sliding work. I may not have needed to file the edges down at all.
