Q:

Angle to Inches Calculator

Is there a calculator that can provide dimensions for a triangle that produce an angle that I specify?  There seems to be an abundance of calculators that tell you what angle you get from dimensions that you supply, but nothing to tell you what dimensions will produce an angle that you supply.

A:

Here is a site for solving triangles.
The user interface doesn't show a right triangle by default (assuming that's what you're after), though the solved triangle does appear to be drawn to scale. Here is what you'll see to start:

Suppose you want a right triangle where, say, you know the bottom side is 96 inches and the angle of elevation is 24 degrees, then type those values into the relevant blanks (don't forget the 90 degree right angle) and click to "calculate":

This will produce the triangle with the missing values filled in:

A:

I created a calculator that searches triangles in 1/8" increments to get as close to the target angle as possible.
As I see it, the advantage of this approach over others is that you can get extremely close to the desired angle while your measurements remain "tape-measure-friendly".
angle = asin(height / hypotenuse)
There is a working demo here

…nothing to tell you what dimensions will produce an angle that you supply.

Angles don’t determine the lengths of the sides. You could supply all three angles and that would constrain the sides to a certain ratio, but you’d still need to supply the length of one of the sides to determine the lengths of the other two.
