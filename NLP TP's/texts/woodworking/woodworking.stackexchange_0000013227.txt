Q:

2 3/4" x 1 1/8" board?

Lumber question for any professional homeowners / handyfolks out there:

I'm replacing a piece of rotted wood on each side of my garage door frame (piece circled in the image). The actual dimensions of the board are 2 3/4" x 1 1/8" .... anyone know what manner of sorcery are those dimensions? None I'm familiar with (nor is Home Depot or Lowe's).
Maybe those are just boards that were custom-cut to get them flush with the siding? In which case I suppose I'd need to get some at a lumber yard?

A:

That is not an "off the shelf" board. Most likely you'll need a buddy with a table saw to cut wood from the BigBox store to the needed dimensions.
You might be able to contact a local lumber dealer and have them cut some boards to size too. There will be a modest charge and lead time.
