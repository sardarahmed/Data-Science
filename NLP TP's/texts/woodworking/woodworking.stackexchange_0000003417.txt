Q:

Cleaning old hard wood

I am building a computer desk out of some old oak boards that had been on the side of an old tobacco barn for around 60 years. I tore the building down and thought, hey I wonder what this would look like cleaned up.  After running the boards through a planner they looked awesome. 
My question to you: Is there anything to be worried about with these boards? They were pretty well coated in black mold. 

A:

I think the most dangerous part was putting them through your planner.  I hope you used a good dust mask.  Lots of that stuff gets airborn when you plane it. 
However, if you made it to clean wood, then you are likely to be pretty good.  You still might want to take precautions when cutting it up, but then you should be doing that anyway, since 'clean' saw dust is still a hazard.
But once you build your desk, and put a seal and finish on it, you shouldn't have much to worry about.

A:

Second the safety aspects of bowlturner's answer. Black molds, if that is indeed what you found, are some of the more dangerous ones to peoples health. They condemn buildings on a significant presence. My only other concern would be for your projects. 
For mold to be growing you typically need higher levels of humidity. I would let you boards normalize for a while and check their moisture content. Possibly leave them out in the sun for a while. If you check it now and its MC is fine then there is no issue. I am worried that your boards are going to warp.
