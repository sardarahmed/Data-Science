Q:

Do I need to treat or finish lumber if I want to use it for a bed

I'm trying to build a platform bed using 2x4 lumber from Home Depot.
I'm wondering if I need to treat the surface somehow if I want to put the mattress on top of the platform. Will a 2x4 surface be smooth enough to put the mattress on top? Or do I need to sand it down or put some other kind of finish? 

A:

The wood used for slats and other surfaces that touch your bedding should be smooth enough not to catch fabric or raise slivers. It does not have to be finished. If you do finish it you must make sure it is fully cured, and not oil-based, before you use it. (Don't bother finishing it.)
A decent planed or scraped surface and rounded or chamfered edges is fine. This is not a time for hours of hand-sanding at the finest grit. Just smooth enough so that you feel safe running your hand across it.
