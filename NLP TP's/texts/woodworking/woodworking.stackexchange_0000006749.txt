Q:

Carving a wood bowl or cut without a lathe

My son wants to make my wife a wooden bowl or cup out of a section of a log.  I don't have a lathe and was wondering if its possible to hollow it out using some type of drill bit or sanding disc on a drill attachment?  

A:

Depending on how deep the cup/bowl will be you may be able to carve it out with a large gouge, hook knife, or scorp.
I would also look into power carving options, such as a burr on a Foredom-style tool, or the arbortech "mini turbo" or "turbo shaft".
With any of these options, though, I think you'd still want to hog out as much waste as possible with a drill press.
