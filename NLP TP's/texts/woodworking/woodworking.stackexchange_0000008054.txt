Q:

Table Saw without ability to lower blade

I recently received a secondhand saw, a black and decker 9442, and from what I can tell there is no way to adjust the blade height.  All I see is a tilt lever to make angle adjustments.
Am I missing something?
From this web shot of the saw it seems to have a lowered blade so I’m a bit confused...
If this is so, what are my options for using this machine safely?  I’ve read about using 7 1/4 circular saw blades on a table saw and thought it might be my only option apart from having a larger 10” blade exposed all the time.

A:

The missing part is going to be a handwheel that attaches to the shaft that's about one-third from the left side of the arc cut into the side of the machine.
As it turns, the motor assembly and saw blade will raise and lower as desired. As FreeMan suggests, grab the shaft with pliers, although that will degrade the surface of the shaft. Consider to pad the pliers with a piece of rubber or canvas to protect it.
Additional research found a possible match on eBay but it would be wise to measure the shaft diameter and ask the seller to measure the item for sale. If there is a keyway on the shaft, that would be a factor to discuss with the seller too.
