Q:

How heavy should the drawer front be?

I just finished building plywood drawers that are 60 cm wide x 50 cm deep x 15 cm high.
They are made of 10 mm plywood, hanging on high quality soft close slides that are rated 45 kg per pair or per slide, I'm not sure, and this is already about 10 times the weight of the drawer and its content.
Now I'm considering using solid oak to make the drawer fronts, which will be 60 cm wide x 36 cm high, in 2 cm thick oak.
This adds up to about 3.6 kg per drawer front, which I find excessive. On the other hand, it's also nice to have that extra mass to the drawer because it helps the moving part of the slide hit the mechanism at the back and trigger the soft close.
So I'm wondering if I'm going to regret adding that extra mass to the drawer.

A:

A solid wood front added to an existing drawer box will be absolutely fine.
If anything, it’ll be better, as it will give a solid ‘thunk’ when it closes.
