Q:

What are the holes in a circular saw rip fence intended for

I have a rip fence on my circular saw similar to the one here. What are the holes for? Can I add a longer piece of metal / wood to extend the fence? Wouldn't that then make the measurements on the fence inaccurate?

A:

The holes are so you can attach a straight longer piece of wood to it.
