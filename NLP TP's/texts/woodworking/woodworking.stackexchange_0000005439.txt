Q:

Hinge that extends flap/door so that it is in line with the wood it is mounted to?

First of just a quick note, I'm struggling to explain exactly  what I'm looking for, so I made a quick image of what I mean.

A new project I'm looking to undertake has me a bit stumped; I want to create a coffee table that has flaps on the shorter of the vertical sides, that fold up and extends the table creating a longer, yet still flat, table.
Now the problem is that I don't want to use just a regular hinge or piano hinge because when the flaps are folded down, there would be a gap between the top and flaps. So of course I tried looking for a solution. At first I thought of European hinges, but when its folded open it doesn't pull back to eliminate the gap between the flaps and table but leaves a gap. So I continued looking for an answer online and found something way better:

Note how when the legs are folded in the table top lies on the flaps/sides. How does one achieve this? Is there a way to have the flaps sides next to the table top instead of under (like in my original idea)? What are the hinges called?
Thanks

This seems to do what you are thinking:

The installation does look rather tricky, though.
