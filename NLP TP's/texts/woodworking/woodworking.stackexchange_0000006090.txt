Q:

What frame saw can I use to mill small lumber?

I am wanting to do some small milling projects. I have pieces of oak and alligator juniper that are between 6 and 14" across that I would like to try and cut into boards. I know I can build my own frame saw with some 2x2's and hardwar, creating a rectangular frame that the saw blade sits within, but I also saw this type:

The thing I like about this design is that I don't have to pass the frame around the stock, because the blade sits at the far end of the frame and can be rotated to cut at any angle (at least the ones I'm looking at buying can). So I can set the piece down and work it horizontally if I like. Does anyone have experience with this type of saw? Will they work better than a rectangular frame saw with the blade completely enclosed? 

A:

The bow saw pictured is a type of frame saw; other frame saws may have a rectangular frame all the way around the outside as you mentioned in a comment.

Will [a commercially-produced bow saw] work better than a home made frame saw?

A homemade frame or bow saw is just as functional as a commercially-produced one. If you can build a frame saw, you can also build a bow saw like the one pictured in your question.

all the stuff I see online for these "bow/frame" saws talks about them being used for finishing work, not milling

Yes, you can use these saws for milling. If desired, you could even use the same bandsaw blade stock that is used for bandsaw mills.
