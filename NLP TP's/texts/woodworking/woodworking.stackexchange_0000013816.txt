Q:

Is the mineral oil sold for constipation the same type of mineral oil used for cutting boards?

I want to make my own mix of beeswax and mineral oil. The mineral oil sold at Home Depot costs over 6 times more than the stuff sold in Walmart for constipation.
Are they the same thing?

A:

Are they the same thing?

Check the label.
You're asking about two unspecified products, so it's hard to say definitively whether they're both exactly the same thing or not. Mineral oil sold for specific applications sometimes has additives that you might or might not care about, such as fragrance and/or stabilizing compounds, even when they're described as "pure mineral oil".
In other words, anything described as "mineral oil" will be very nearly the same thing as "cutting board oil," and they're likely interchangeable for your purpose, but check the label to be certain.
