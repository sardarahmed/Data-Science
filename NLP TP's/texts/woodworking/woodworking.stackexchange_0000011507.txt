Q:

Advice for cutting a thick, wide, poplar board

I have a 4" thick, 10.5" wide by 120" long poplar board (read heavy) that I was originally going to saw into workbench bench legs but now want to saw into a handrailing. Any ideas on how to saw so that it is 4" wide?
I have Laguna 14BX 14" bandsaw, do you think if it is properly supported (I have a king resaw blade on it) that will work? Otherwise I have a 3hp sawstop, but wound't cut all the way through nor a circular saw. Thanks for the help, it'd be expensive or worse to mess it up.

A:

You could rip it both on the table saw and on the band saw.
With the table saw, you'll need to do at least two cuts, as the depth of cut probably is around 3". If the board is straight and has a clean edge and the table saw is well setup you should have a nearly seamless cut. I've done the same on 4x4's with great success.
Band saws typically have good height capacity, and I'm sure your 14" saw can handle 4" to thickness (my 10" Delta will easily resaw 6" with a good blade).
In both cases, support both the infeed and the outfeed. You could experiment with a piece of 2x6 that you rip to 4" width and then rip again facing up (i.e. the 1.5" side sitting on the table of the saw). Do this with a 2' piece to get the feel of sawing your 4" thick board.
