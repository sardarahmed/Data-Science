Q:

Cost-effective wood selection for outdoor craft project

Lots of questions here about outdoor wood/finishes but most of them are for furniture or other high-end projects.  I'm looking to build planters like this one...

The plans I purchased list MDF as the material but I can't imagine using that for anything outside, even for something on a covered porch.  I want to find a good balance between durability and material cost.  I don't expect it to last forever but if it falls apart after one season it isn't worth my time.
I suspect the readily available pine with a decent exterior finish might be my best bet but would like to hear your recommendations and reasoning behind them.
Thanks all!

A:

Exterior grade MDF is available here in Europe, but in US I don't know about cost or availability. It is very durable with finish applied, but cost is high.
Exterior grades of plywood should be available everywhere, and much cheaper. Recent question on exterior plywood here Exterior Plywood that looks relatively nice
Because of current high prices plywood probably cheaper than solid wood, except for construction lumber. Plywood is already all correct thickness and large dimensions, so much less work needed to build this so I think very sensible choice.
