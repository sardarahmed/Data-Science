Q:

How does a variable speed control mechanism work?

To change speeds on many drill presses and lathes, the user needs to turn off the machine, and manually move the belts between a variety of pulleys.
On a machine with variable speed control, the user can simply adjust a lever to change the speed. On at least certain models, the speed can only be changed while the machine is running.
How does this mechanism work? Why does it require the machine to be running?

A:

The machines which need to be running in order to adjust the variable speed often use a Reeves drive, which consists of two variable-diameter pulleys linked via a V-belt. The two sheaves of each pulley are adjusted closer or further from each other to increase or decrease the diameter of the pulley, respectively. In order to preserve the proper belt tension, one pulley's diameter must increase while the other pulley's diameter decreases, and the machine must be running so the belt can track these adjustments.

Some other types of machines with variable speed control use electronic speed controls to directly adjust the speed of the motor.
