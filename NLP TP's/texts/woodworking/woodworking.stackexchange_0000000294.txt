Q:

Can one install bench dog holes in soft surfaces like MDF or softwoods?

I have a number of Kreg workbenches that I have made with help of their Pocket-hole jig.  The workbench tops are made by layering MDF atop a 2x4 frame.  I am wondering whether multiple layers of MDF would be effective in holding a bench dog tightly, or would it begin to tear out due to the powdery qualities of MDF?

A:

My bench top is made of 2 half inch pieces of MDF that I laminated together with wood glue and screws. I drilled about 8 holes for my brass bench dogs. I have used those bench dogs for over a year now, when using my hand planes and router, etc. I have never noticed any kind of deformation or loosening of the hold due to the qualities of the MDF.
Also, MDF is cheap, and MDF bench tops are such a great idea in the first place because they can be easily replaced. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.
