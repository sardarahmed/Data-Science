Q:

Do link type V-Belts work in variable speed mechanism?

I bought an old Delta wood lathe that has a variable speed feature. The variable speed works by varying the spacing between two sheaves that changes the net diameter of the pulley and thus the speed ratio from the motor. Typically two sheave type pulleys are used in conjunction so that the effective diameter of one increases while the other one will decrease keeping the net belt length constant.
My question is whether this type of drive can be used with the link type V-Belts?
These link type belts do run much smoother on fixed size pulleys I have on my jointer. Here is a picture comparison of a conventional V-belt and a Link type belt. They are also length adjustable in increments of approximately 3/4 inch (20 mm) by adding or removing links.

I had ordered a length of the red link type VBelt via Amazon. The order was cancelled and refunded for some strange reason whilst I was on vacation. So I reordered it again and it arrived the other day.
Assembly of the link belt was very convenient in the lathe because I was able to avoid having to dismount the motor and take apart the whole variable speed pully sheave mechanism.
I must say that the link type belt works very nicely in the lathe's variable speed adjuster. Overall the lathe drive system is smoother and operates with about half to one third of the noise and vibration of the original V-Belt.
