Q:

Triangle Screw & Double Sided Eyes?

I have a system of what appears to be a triangle screw (Or an eye screw bent into the shape of a triangle) and a double sided eye hook with some kind of washer on it. I couldn't find any references to it anywhere I searched. What kind of fasteners are these?

A:

It seems to be a swing hook with bearing or swing hangers.
