Q:

How to make shallow flat-bottomed hole on 5mm thickness wood slice?

I want to make a wood slice magnet which an extra thickness magnet is inserted on a 5mm thickness wood slice.
Here is my material.

The trouble is that I couldn't find a suitable forstner for it, and a pilot hole may break the thin slice. After deep research, I found someone use router:

It looks nice, but soon I found holding a small wood slice for routing is different case.
Is there a better tool for my need?

A:

If you have a plunge router, I'd clamp the wood slice from above with a larger chunk of wood. 
To help a little with maintaining position, I'd tack two tracks onto your worktop. (Make them shorter than your wood slice, of course.

If you're doing more than a couple, I'd screw the larger chunk of wood to the base of the router for perfect alignment. (If that's too bothersome, plunge the bit into the hole you've made -- power cord unplugged, of course -- to maintain alignment when you're clamping everything in place. This will take a few attempts, as you can no longer see your slice for alignment.)
Then clamp everything up and go for it. If you haven't screwed the guide wood to your router, then you'll need to clamp the router down as well.

With the hole established in the larger chunk of wood, you should be able to put crosshairs on the slice and eyeball the alignment.
