Q:

Similar wood to Koa

Long story short, I recently got a chance to visit Hawaii a few months ago, and while there really fell in love with all of the Koa wood stuff they have there. The wood is really beautiful, but the problem is that it's really expensive (they can only harvest downed or dying trees).
My question is does anyone know of a wood that is similar in grain and color to Koa? I'm not interested in its tonal properties, just the grain and color. 

Image for those unfamiliar with the wood. 

A:

Pau Ferro looks like it is similar to Koa, but I think it will be tough to find a wood that looks exactly like Koa.   Also, Pau Ferro is from South America, so it is possible that it would be even harder to source than Koa.  The below photo is sealed/finished Pau Ferro; its natural color is a lighter matte, but the grain pattern (save for the amazing quilting) is very similar to Koa.

A:

There is a reason why koa is so expensive: it truly is one of a kind.  In fact, not even all koa looks like that pictured.  I have some that is much plainer in appearance.  Other woods that have similar hues usually don't have the figuring, and vice versa.  If you are interested in the color palette, you can look at woods like cocobolo, bocote, ziricote and other members of the rosewood family, but be aware that those will not be much less expensive.  All of the pau ferro I have used is not like that pictured in the other answer, but wood varies greatly even within a species.
