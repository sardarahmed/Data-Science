Q:

How many times can I sharpen a planer blade?

When time comes around I will need to sharpen the planer blade. I was wanting to know how many times I could sharpen these blades before it becomes 'accurate'. Meaning, as I sharpen the blade X times it will get shorter so when I turn the knob it might cut 1/32 less than I want. But I will be doing this by hand so I think that I could do this many times. Edit: This is a 13" thickness planer

A:

In general, planer blades are adjustable, such that they are repositioned to the original cutting position (protrusion) after sharpening. So the question becomes "How many times can I sharpen my planer blades before I can no longer reposition them properly (or safely)?".
The answer to this depends on at least two things:

How much material you remove when you sharpen the blades.
How much "extra" material the blades have on them to begin with.

If you are merely restoring sharpness to an otherwise good blade, you may be able to remove only say 0.015" (fifteen thousandths). If you need to grind out nicks in the blade, you may need to remove much more.
Some of the newer blades I've seen have very little extra "meat" on them and can perhaps only realistically be sharpened once or twice.
So you'll have to consider your particular situation and see what you think.
Note that the length of the planer blade has no connection to the maximum depth of cut. The planer blade remains stationary in the rotating head regardless of the depth adjustment. Only the infeed positioning is changed by the depth adjustment.
