Q:

How does this leg vise parallel chain guide work?

I am planning a new workbench with a leg vise and came across this chain assembly  for the parallel guide in a couple pictures.

I cannot find any other information on it, but it looks like it pulls the guide out as the chop is pulled out.  The problem is that I do not see how the chain keeps the chop parallel when the chop is being tightened.  Note that the parallel guide does not have holes and so is not pinned to avoid racking when the clamp is tightened.  Am I missing something?

Yep.  
 
This drawing from Shigshop shows the part that is not visible in your photos.
Under the slide, mounted in the leg, is a wheel/bearing that allows the lower part of the chop to move in without binding.  The chain keeps the far end of the slide at a constant height which keeps it from binding.
Shigshop is also a source for buying plans for a roubo style work bench - if you are so inclined.
