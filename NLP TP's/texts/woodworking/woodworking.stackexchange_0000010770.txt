Q:

What is this part shown in this video?

I'm watching a YouTube video about making an armchair, and at the 01:27 mark they show this metal bits that looks like short hollow nails with tiny throwingstars for a head. They're hammered into the wood and seem to provide threads for screws to fasten into. The shape of their heads seems to be meant to allow further reinforcement using nails or other screws. What are they called?

A:

That is called a  Tnut.

Tnut search.
It is similar to a threaded insert but it is pressed into the wood and has little points that  grab the wood and  keeps it from rotating when you thread a bolt into it.
A threaded insert as threads on the outside and is threaded into the wood like a screw.
