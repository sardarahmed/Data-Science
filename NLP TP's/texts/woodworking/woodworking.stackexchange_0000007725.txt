Q:

What hinges & supports could I use for a long & heavy plywood window seat lid?

I've been asked by my better half to do a full length lid on our window seat. It would be 2400mm long and 580mm deep, 18mm baltic birch plywood which the provider says would weigh approx 22kg. Checking on http://theplywood.com/weight says it would be 16kg so quite a range. 
I'm trying to figure out what kind of hinge/openers would assist with opening it so it could be done 1-handed, but also be able to hold it open and provide a soft close. I'm guessing some form of piston as that's what I've seen on car bonnets (hoods). I'm assuming that the length of the lid would cause an issue as a hinge at either end might not be enough. It may be that this is a terrible idea and I should go back to researching split cushions that would make her happy.

A:

There is actually such a thing as a Bench Seat Hinge but the heavy duty ones only seem to take up to 12kg. You might be able to find one that'll take more weight, but my suggestion would be to split the seat lid into two or three sections and hinge them individually (assuming your better half doesn't object to a split lid). If you're going to be upholstering them too that'll also add to the weight.
The soft close would require a Soft Down Support - there are a number of different options out there, and the support will actually take some of the weight off the hinges and you could then use a pair of more normal cabinet hinges per section.
