Q:

Epoxy bar top finish over boiled linseed oil

I made bar top out of reclaimed redwood (planed and edged to clean wood) which I edged with stained white ash.  I intented to apply bar top epoxy.  I was using boiled linseed oil on other projects and without any thought decided to apply boiled linseed to my top.  Is there any way I can still epoxy this top or should I go with polyurethane?  Thanks for the help.

A:

I think you are good as long as you have let the BLO fully cure/dry.  Which could be up to a month or more depending on how thick it is and the drying conditions.
