Q:

How do I fix a hairline crack in a hollow core door stile?

I'm installing a door knob and latch in a hollow core door.  While screwing in the latch faceplate, I noticed a long hairline crack that starts at the latch bore and runs maybe 8 inches up the stile.  Highlighted in red in the picture.

The crack opens up when I tighten the faceplate screws.  I initially thought one of the screws cracked the wood but now I'm thinking the crack was there when I got the door and it's the pressure of the plate that's making it open up.  The crack doesn't look like it runs over the screw hole.
This is probably not a big deal but I don't like having the crack there and it's not going to get better on its own.  How do I tie it back together?  The crack is too tight to get glue in there.

A:

Many woodworkers use superglue for hairline cracks, but epoxy is also good for this and is stronger.
Superglue is thin, will enter hairline cracks due to 'capillary action'. With no further help expect 1-3mm penetration, enough to glue surface of crack together. If you blow glue into crack like @Graphus mentions in comments, 3-5mm penetration.
If this is not enough for you, use slow-set epoxy. Apply to surface and you can wait >10 minutes for glue to penetrate due to gravity!

The crack opens up when I tighten the faceplate screws.

The crack is too tight to get glue in there.

Tighten faceplate screws to help glue enter crack. After applying glue remove faceplate and crack will close, so no need for clamping.
Then leave glue to set before final installation of faceplate.
