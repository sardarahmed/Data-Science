Q:

Can I chamfer/bevel the top of a post with a router?

I have a 110mm square laminated pine post.
I want to put a 45 degree bevel on the top of the post, around all four edges.
I don't have a mitre saw, but I do have a plunge router and a 45 degree chamfer bit.
Working on a scrap section of post, and chamfering from the sides of the post, not the top (that is, I rest the router base on the side of the post, bevel that edge of the top and then turn the post onto a different face) I've found that I can't keep the router level -- not enough of the router base is on the post.
Is there some jig or trick I should be using? Or is a plunge router an unsuitable tool for this job?

A:

You can place some pieces of the same thickness stock on both sides of the post, and another perpendicular to it at the top to provide a surface at the same level for the router base to sit on.
I wouldn't use the plunge feature - just set the bit to the correct depth and let the router ride on the flat surface provided by the post and the other pieces.
Note that all the wood involved - the guide pieces as well as the workpiece -should be clamped in place.
