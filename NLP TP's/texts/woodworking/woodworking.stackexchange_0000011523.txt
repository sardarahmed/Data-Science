Q:

Straightening a green bent walking stick

I recent found an awesome stick while hiking with my family (in mid
January)
Since then I have removed all the bark and sanded it to make it look even more awesome(er)
I even wrapped the top in leather strips (which looks great!)
The problem is that today I decided that the stick was not "straight enough" and had too much bend...
So I decided to try to clamp it straight on a flat board...
It decided to crack on a knot (which I am sure I can probably glue back together), I did not steam it at all (as I did not have the means)
How long should I leave the wood clamped straight so that it wont bounce back right away (and finally fix my big crack of a mistake)?

If the wood is green, then you may be able to straighten it by clamping it to something straight and letting it dry in that configuration. How long it takes to dry will depend on the species, the diameter of the stick, the moisture content, and the ambient temperature and humidity.
If the stick is already dry, then just clamping it and letting it sit is unlikely to straighten it; it'll just spring back to its former shape when you unclamp it. Dry wood tends to break instead of deforming when pushed beyond its elastic limit; if you want to permanently change its shape without breaking it you'll need to apply heat or moisture or both.
