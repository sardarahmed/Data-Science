Q:

Joining acrylic and dowel with nut and bolt?

I'm planning to do this project that involves joining acrylic (1cm or 0.4inches thick) to a dowel that's 2.75cm (1 1/16inches) in diameter. I plan on joining the acrylic piece onto the dowel by cutting a hole in the acrylic (using a laser cutter) equal to the size of the hole I'll drill through the dowel, and join them together with a bolt and nut. Does this sound like an achievable thing that won't require enormous amount of time and effort (I'm kind of on a deadline?) Here's what it might look like:

Many thanks.

I don't see any major problems with that.  Drilling a two holes and running a bolt through them to hold them together is a pretty simple task.  Though drilling a large hole through a dowel can be tricky unless you have a drill press and clamp the dowel well.  They want to twist and roll.  But with the bare minimum you've given us, yes, it's possible and should be reasonable.  Leaving me with the questions of why? and what is this for?
