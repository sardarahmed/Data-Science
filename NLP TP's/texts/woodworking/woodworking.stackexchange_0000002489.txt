Q:

Which solvents can be stored in which plastics? -- is there an organic chemist in the house?

Now that coffee cans, and even larger glass bottles, are becoming hard to find, my workshop's pile of containers is mostly plastic. This has me wondering/worrying about which plastics might be dissolved by (or contaminate) which common woodworking solvents.
I presume that all of them are safe for alcohol and, of course, water. But I'm less sure about paint thinner, lacquer thinner, mineral spirits, the various oil-based paints and varnishes.
I know I've seen Styrofoam melt when exposed to nothing more than lemon juice. I don't know whether that means I should avoid polystyrene generally.
Any advice?

A:

A quick google search found me this website, which has a nifty compatibility chart that I've attached below.

Cole-Parmer has a very comprehensive compatibility chart for many solvents (organic or otherwise).
For some common solvents, I've summarized some info from Cole-Parmer:

Turpentine is no good for ABS plastic, brass, EPDM, LDPE, rubber, neoprene, and a whole slew of others.  I'd look at the Cole-Parmer list for comprehensive info.
Mineral spirits (aka paint thinner) are no good for ABS plastic, HDPE, and EPDM.
Linseed oil is no good for EPDM, rubber, and neoprene
Ethyl alcohol (the kind you can drink) will dissolve polyurethane but is pretty much OK for everything else
Methyl (wood) alcohol (the kind that makes you blind) is no good for ABS plastic and polyurethane
Lacquer thinner is no good for EPDM, rubber, neoprene, polypropylene, polyurethane, PVC, and silicone

For further information, I'd check the Cole-Parmer website.  I've tried to summarize as best I could, but this isn't the proper format for a comprehensive scope.
