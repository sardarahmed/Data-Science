Q:

How challenging is it to sand a stained oak floor?

I am about to do a little touching up of a stained oak floor.

I am concerned that sanding the floor with a machine would be infeasible because it means that the stain would be gone from some parts more than others, and then it will be necessary to do a heavy sanding, staining from scratch, and apply multiple polyurethane coats.
In your experience, is it possible to do local touching up of such a floor, perhaps by a tedious but more gentle hand sanding? Or is it just a job that has to be done for the entire area?

A:

It depends.  If it's fairly small, doing it by hand can save time and money and effort.  But how small?  On top of that it's location is also important.  Is it the size of a small throw rug and in the middle of a high traffic area?  then it might be a lot harder to get it to match and not stand out like a sore thumb, especially if you haven't done something like that before.  Is it under a window where there is some water damage and can be hidden by a piece of furniture? then it might be worth the trouble of hand sanding and refinishing.
My dad has completely done several wood floors.  Renting a big sander for the floor and doing the whole floor at once (according to my dad) really doesn't take that long and leaves you with the best finish.  Last one was my Sister and brother-in-laws dining room floor.  It's about 15' x 13' and they had it all sanded in less than a day.  So with a little help and planning, the entire floor could be sanded down and refinished in a weekend.  (depending on size of floor)
