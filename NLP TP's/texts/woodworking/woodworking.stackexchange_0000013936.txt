How to design supporting strut for 4-piece rock and roll bed

I am making a 4-piece 'rock and roll' style bed which converts into two opposite facing bench seats when in the upright position.  Constructed out of 18mm ply with supporting structural members where required.  Images from Sketchup included at the bottom
When in the upright position, I want the backrest to be stable.  To some extent the triangulation of the two vertical ply members will provide some stability, but I am worried that there will still be a lot of movement (or bounce if you like) as I have made the design so that, at minimum extension of the bed platform, the angle of the backrests is ~75-80 degrees from horizontal.
There is not a lot of room below the top level of framing and the internal cavity underneath as I will be using this space to house drawers so I want to minimise the bulk of any supporting strut that i add to achieve my objective.
I am thinking that I will need a cross-brace between the two backrests to provide support, or a brace from one of the backrests back to a solid point attached to the framing.
How can i do this in a way that will minimise bulk, be easy to use/retract and fold back to flush when the bed is in the extended position?

A:

I ended up using piano hinges and the backrests are self supporting and don't move at all.  Very happy with the outcome.
As a side note, I routed grooves to reduce weight and add airflow.  this process took a long time and was a huge PITA - I can now see the value of a CNC mill! :)
