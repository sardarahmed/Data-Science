Q:

What tool would this handle be for?

I was at LeeValley at the clearance section because I remember the last time I was there they had some cheap totes. I was flipping through the bin and found a couple that I could use. 
While I was looking I found a few handles that I could not place as totes for planes. Your standard plane totes are flat on the bottom for where they meet the body. These however are curved on both ends.
The following picture shows two such handles side by side. One shows the top while the other shows the bottom.

It must be for a plane but I can't figure out which one? For that reason I am hesitenet to use plane

A:

I'm not that familiar with new-build tools but that looked naggingly familiar and I was relatively sure it was for a saw and not any sort of plane. This made it easy to track down:

Edit: it looks like the handle is common to their tenon saw as well even though it features a slightly different means of attachment:
