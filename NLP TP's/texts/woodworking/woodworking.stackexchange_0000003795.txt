Q:

How can I stop wobbling after installing a table saw blade

Every time I install my table saw blade it is a little wobbly, is there a proper way to install a blade? Should I have the table saw on it's side and put it on? What am I doing wrong.
The saw is a Rockwell Shop Series 10" Table Saw.

A:

This sounds like a problem with the fabrication or assembly of the saw so there may not be a correct answer.  I am concerned that the saw may not be safe so I am answering this with a few recommendations on how to verify it's safety.
Reviews of the saw on sites like Amazon are not very complementary.  If you can return it I would consider doing so.  If not...

Check the blade for flatness.  If you lay it on its side on a flat surface does it lie flat all around?  Try using another blade in the saw to see if it wobbles the same way.
Check the mountings of the motor to the housing to make sure everything is secure. Tighten up everything you can.
Rotate the shaft (unplugged) to see if it is bent.  If it is then the shaft must be replaced.  I can't tell from the manual whether this requires a new motor or not.
If the wobble is slight, try shimming the blade as suggested by grfrazee in his comment. I'm not sure how this is done so you might ask another question to get more info.
