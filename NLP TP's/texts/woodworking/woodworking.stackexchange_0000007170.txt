Q:

Is wood-glue enough or should I use extra support?

I am building a 2' x 2' bar table, which will be either supported by a single metal base (like this) or by wooden legs at the corners. 
For the table-top, I'm planning on using Poplar from Lowe's in sections of 0.75"x1.5"x2' glued together. The edges will use a lap joint with a dowel through both pieces. It'll look like this (crude drawing warning):

My question is: in either configuration - a center support column or corner legs - would any other structural support be needed for the table top (or is wood-glue enough)?
Thanks!

So, I ended up going with the "Don't do it!" answer. In the end, the table is made by gluing the pieces together and running 3 dowels through them and the edges are simply routed. I don't think the dowels add much, structurally, but they sure made the glue-up easier. 
Thanks for all of the advice from everyone! Here's the table top progression, in case you're wondering:
