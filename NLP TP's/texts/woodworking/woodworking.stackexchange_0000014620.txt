Q:

Flush trim bits too short for 1/4in router

I have a trim router with a 1/4in shank size and need to flush trim plywood that is 30mm thick. All flush trim bits that I could find which are long enough are for 1/2in shank routers? What are my options and which one should I go with?

I though about buying a 1/4in to 1/2in adapter, but I am worried that the adapter may be too wide. This is the 1/2 flush trim bit I set my eyes on: https://www.freudtools.com/products/44-108. As for an adapter, I would get something generic from Amazon.

A shorter 1/4in flush trim bit and an extension, so the bearing can reach the reference surface to glide on. Once the first pass is done, I would move the flush trim bit up (now riding on the first pass' trimmed surface) and so on.

Any suggestions are welcome.

A:

Extensions and adapters,etc. are just going to get in your way I think. Get a bit with a longer cutting surface:
