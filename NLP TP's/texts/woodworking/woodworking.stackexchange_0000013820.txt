Q:

Difference between basic arrangement and methods of dimensional lumber frames

When I'm arranging dimensional lumber in a frame there are three basic arrangements I can make.  Is there a standard for using these arrangements?
Below is an image of a CAD design of 2x4 dimensional lumber in 3 arrangements.

Having the long ends overlap - Supports vertical forces like house frames.
Having the short ends overlap - Any benefit to this? it seems weak compared to 1.
Having each side overlap once in a spiral - Square frames have each board cut to equal length.

A:

There are probably standard framing practices (note the s) taught formally as well as good handed-down working practices all over the world, with far less consistency than one might expect.

It's not as simple as this but in terms of basic principles orientation matters — in general you want wood to support wood rather than for fasteners to do the job.
So, your 1 for long side up, 2 for short side up, and 3 perhaps never LOL (although it would be fine laid flat obviously).
But #1: external fixturing changes everything; with metal fastener plates it is now normal practice to totally ignore this basic principle, simplest example is probably joist hangers.
But #2: assuming glue and screws/nails only with no external metal fixtures other construction details matter hugely; there's obviously actual joinery options to consider first, but also modern construction practices such a stressed-skin construction. With stressed-skin construction (think torsion box) you can essentially break all the rules of framing — you can orient framing members the 'wrong' way and even gaps don't matter (!) because the plywood/OSB skin does so much of the work.
