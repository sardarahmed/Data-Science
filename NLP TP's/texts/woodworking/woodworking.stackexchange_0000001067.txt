Q:

Should router bits be stored with the gel coating that came on them when they were originally purchased?

My straight router bit came in a little plastic box that has a hole that the shaft of the bit fits into.
The other half of the bit (i.e. with the two cutting edges) was covered in some transparent gel. From the way the gel looks it is obvious that the gel was applied in liquid form and then cured on/around the bit.
I suspect that this gel is there to seal the bit from air, especially moist air, to prevent corrosion. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Does it make sense to reapply the gel when storing the bit?
I found many images of bits being stored without such gels in simple wooden boxes. Does it depend on the bit?
Hardening steel changes its properties possibly making it more prone to corrosion.
Does it depend on the material of the bit?

A:

The gel is something similar to Stripcoat (http://www.evanscoatings.com/).  Prior to the bit being placed in individual packages, they can be bumped together.  The hot melt coating on them keeps the edges intact during handling.  Some of the coatings also have a layer of oil to protect against rust.  
I have a few pounds of this stuff I keep in my shop for when I need to make a cover for a chisel or something that I want to protect the edge on.  It is handy stuff that can be re-melted and reused several times.  If you spend any time in a machine shop, you will see most finished parts dipped in this or something similar.

A:

Don't worry about it- for most bits other than straight bits, you won't get the protective gel off without tearing it up anyway.
I keep those little packets of silica gel that seem to accompany many products today and throw one in any closed drawer or enclosed space. In my portable toolchest, I keep a piece of chalk or two, which also absorb moisture.
