Q:

How do I securely hang heavy closet shelves?

Original Question
I recently built a pair of custom shelves for a closet remodel. Ideally, I would like to float these shelves by securing them to some studs.
Shelving dimensions are 72"x32"x16". The shelving roughly weighs 100lbs and built with 3/4" birch plywood. The shelves would only carry the weight of common items found in your home closet so nothing too heavy. I have added 4" mounting points underneath each shelf fastened in place with 6 pocket holes.
I was thinking of using lag screws to secure them to the studs. Would this be overkill or would some finely threaded 3 1/2 inch wood screws work? Thank you in advance!

Completion Notes
I took the advice in the accepted answer and went with RSS Rugged Structural Screws. The only ones I could find at my local hardware store were 5/16x4" RSS which may be overkill for this project but the cabinets are securely attached to studs. I think in retrospect I would go with a smaller construction screw with a french cleat system for easier installation and to make the install more aesthetically pleasing.

A:

A #9 GRK R4 construction screw is rated about 175lbs shear strength (actual value depends on the materials being joined).  Your design will cross 2 studs, so you should be able to get 6 screws at least in your hanger boards.  Conservatively, that'll give you a shear resistance on the shelves close to 1000lbs.   They should also have adequate pull-through resistance.   If you go with long enough screws that you get 2+ inches in the stud, pull-out resistance will be more than adequate as well.   Just make sure you use construction grade screws, not a cheap knock-off or deck fastener grade.
If you want a bigger insurance policy, though, you could go with GRK RSS (Rugged Structural Screws in 1/4").   Self drilling like the R4, construction screws, but about 4X the shear, pull-out and pull-through resistance.
