Q:

Fixing a door's edge properly

I have a corner hutch with a typical top half which has the top half glass and the bottom have a set of solid doors. Here's a pic:

I did some restoration on this a few years ago and saved it from getting painted by the previous owner (who'd do that to wood, right?) While this job was not a perfect restoration or anything, I did get it back to the point where the wood showed and the stain was fairly even. It took me quite a while to get it back into shape. 
One of the things which has always bugged me is, the doors at the bottom have some damage on them which is mainly on the inside, so isn't readily seen. What Is there a specific way in which I should try to repair them? Is there a way to patch them, or do I need to replace the wood? Here are a pictures of the damage:

A:

If the defect were in a location that was not subject to wear and abuse, you could fill the defect with wood putty.  After it cured, you could sand it down, and finish to taste.  Unfortunately, this location will get beat up further, and the wood putty would just chip off.
A better possibility is to make a "patch" out of a similar piece of wood.  Trim away just enough of the existing wood that you have a good, clean surface, with a regular enough shape that you can make a complementary patch.  Shape the patch to match, so that the patch stands slightly proud.  Attach the patch, probably with glue.  Sand down the patch to smoothly match the piece.  Finish to taste.
