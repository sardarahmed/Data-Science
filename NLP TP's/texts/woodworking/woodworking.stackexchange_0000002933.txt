Q:

Threaded vial or similar container?

I've turned a "magic wand" as a Christmas gift for my niece.  If you're familiar with the Harry Potter stories you probably know that wands usually contain something inside of them (i.e. Unicorn hairs, dragon heartstrings, phoenix feathers.)  Since my niece is a huge animal lover I'm talking with the local zoo about getting something special.  I would like to place these in a small vial that can be screwed into a threaded insert in the bottom of the wand.  
I've been looking for something like this all morning but searching online tends to give me large vials, or items related to the medical industry.  Can anyone here point me toward a suitable product, or recommend better search terms that might get me closer to what I actually want?  I'm open to alternative ways of accomplishing this as well if anyone has suggestions.

I think something like a necklace vial will work for your purpose:

If you've ever been to a mall and seen the kiosks where someone will write your name on a grain of rice, these are pretty much the same thing.
