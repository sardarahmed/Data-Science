Q:

Best way to join frame members in a rectangle box using bolts?

What is the best way to join these wooden beams together, to form a rectangle box which is capable of significant weight? I'd like the ability to deconstruct it, so something involving metal bolts would be preferred.
Here is an example of what the end result would look like, however they are using screws, which I'd like to avoid.

I'm not sure if I should be using a steel side plate on each corner, or if I should put a bolt straight through and join each beam together. Although if I use bolts, then I always end up with one half being loose (as they overlap). 

A:

I can't say this is the best way to bolt together a 90Â° angle but this way of using bolts and captive nuts is widely used in workbench construction where it has to withstand considerable racking forces so it's definitely one good way:

Instead of having the shallow mortise and the tenon to prevent twisting you can use a pair of bolts, with the end of the rails flush against the uprights:

As you can see the washer and bolt head can also remain on the surface if they won't get in the way.
Another option is just having one bolt (usually in the centre but sometimes offset lower) along with one or more dowels as shown in one of the images in this previous Answer.
