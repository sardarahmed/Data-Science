Farmer Table Legs

Starting on a farmer's table and have it all how I want it designed, but I'm looking for assurance on my method of attaching the legs. I don't have a bountiful workshop, but I do have a table saw and dado blade!
This table top will be 8' long, 43.5" wide, and 29.5" high, contstructed of 2x8 boards with 2 perpendicular 2x8 ends. The apron will be constructed of 1x4s and will be 90" long and 37.5" wide, to allow for 3" overhang of the top. There will be a brace half way along the length, and an additional 4 slats to support and help mount the top to it.
For the legs, I intend to "tendon" .75" x 3.5" off two adjoining sided of the legs, thus notching them to slide into the corners and be flush with the apron. I can then attach an angled cut of wood across the corners, stopping horizontal movement. 
My problem is then how to stop vertical movement. I am currently thinking about drilling the angled cut into the leg, screwing in a threaded rod (like a headless lag bolt?) and then keeping it secure with washer and nut. Would this work, or is there another way?

A:

If you select the "Design" tag and the "more info" button you will get a link to the sagulator which can be used to evaluate your design.  I did a quick test and it appears that the 1 1/2" thick top can handle the possible loads, especially with the 3 1/2" deep aprons.  I would suggest that the horizontal intermediate slats in your apron frame be turned vertical (they offer little support horizontally).  Your legs appear to be 4x4 posts.  If aprons are fully glued to the legs you may have adequate rigidity. The threaded rods would not offer as much strength as the glue would and the glued connections will not require exposed hardware on the outside.  The final test is to build it. You can always add more rigidity by adding a second slat on the other side (interior) of the legs if the design does not offer enough strength as shown in your sketch.
