Q:

Removing Spilled Paint and Staining Table

A clumsy contractor put a paint can on a table of mine (no stain, varnish, 100% fresh wood) and a ring of paint got left behind on the table. What is the best way to remove the paint so that I can stain the table and have it look nice? I'm not even sure what kind of wood the table is made from. It's definitely not oak. It's a white-ish wood with very faint grains visible. Maybe maple?
I was thinking of using paint stripper to get the paint off but I'm afraid that when I come back to stain, I'll see splotches. I'm hoping to avoid extreme sanding.

A:

If this is raw wood then some of that water-based finish remover should be just fine. You can dab it on just where you see paint, cover with plastic wrap to keep it wet, and let it sit as per the product instructions. I'd use painter's tape to seal the edges.
As long as it is wet, it is active. So you can scrape it off carefully with a scraper and maybe fine wet sandpaper. You can even try steel wool, though some people recommend against this. Maybe stainless steel wool is better.
Once the paint is removed you want to carefully clean the the area down with clean wet rags to remove any residual stripper and let the wood dry completely. If done carefully I suspect you will only have to do a light sanding prep to get ready for finishing.
If the stain soaked in deeper, you can try stripping it again. In fact, sometimes I get better results reapplying the stripper on damp wood.
