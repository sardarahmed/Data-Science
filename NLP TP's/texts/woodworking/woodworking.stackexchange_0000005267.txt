Q:

How can I harden soft woods?

I want to build a coffee table out of cedar planks treated with the Shou-Sugi-Ban method.
The problem is that cedar is too soft for regular use and will get notched and scratched very quickly.
How can I harden the surface of the wood to ensure it lasts longer?

A:

Putting a glass top over it would be simplest.
There are epoxies made for bar tops which might work, but I have no idea what they would do over a soft wood. 
There are compounds used to harden partially rotted wood, but I would be even more distrustful of trying to force them into a use they weren't designed for.
