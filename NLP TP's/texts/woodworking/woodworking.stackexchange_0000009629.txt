Q:

Router, how make a deep plunge cut?

I am really new to woodworking and I'm out of ideas on how to accomplish this.
I am making a magnetic knife block. The stock is 11" long x 3" wide x 1 12/16" deep. I need to cut a 1 1/4" wide by 1 11/16" deep groove.
I have a router with plunge and fixed base and a router table. My router only goes 1" deep (bit depth).
Does anyone have any good ideas? I've considered a drill bit and chisel, but I don't have a drill press and this has to be accurate(ish).

A:

The depth that a router can cut depends on the router as well as the bit.  Look for a long router bit and you should be able to cut to the depth you need.  You don't need a large bit - use a small (3/8 or 1/2" diameter) bit and multiple passes to cut the groove.
