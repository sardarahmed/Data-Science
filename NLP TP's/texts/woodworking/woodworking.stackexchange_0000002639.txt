Q:

How can I calculate the value for a corner radius?

I'm not asking how to solve what a corner radius is on a piece, rather how to calculate what corner radius I should use on a piece.

I need to make a (negative) template to follow with my router. In order to do so, I need to use a hole saw to drill out a curved corner. I'm having trouble calculating what the corner radius would be such that I can determine what size hole saw to use.
The picture probably explains better than my words, but essentially I want to round off the corners of a rectangle with the curve starting 3/4" away from the corner. I don't know if this is more math but it's something I've run into previously while woodworking. 
How would I determine both the size of the hole saw to use as well as the distance I should center it from the corner (r)?

A:

Your diagram I think doesn't actually clarify the situation.

If I'm reading this correctly 3/4" is your radius, so double that is the diameter of the bit you need to use. I don't think it's any more complicated than that.
To place the centre point in relation to the corner, you can do that just by marking outwards in both directions 3/4" and using a try square to cross the lines. Alternatively if you want to mark along the 45Â°, using Pythagoras it'll be 1.06" (or just a hair under 27mm) from the corner.

A:

If you want the curve to start 3/4" away from the corner the radius of your curve is going to be 3/4".  So, to make that curve with a drill bit, double the radius to get the diameter of the bit... 1-1/2" bit.  It would be centered 3/4" away from each side.
