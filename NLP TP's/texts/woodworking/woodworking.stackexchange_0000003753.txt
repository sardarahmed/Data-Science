Q:

Looking for a specific drill bit holder that reduces cam out

My father in law has a bit holder that doesn't actually allow the bit to turn unless enough pressure is applied. I've found that this helps to prevent cam out. I have not been able to find another one for sale.
Would anyone have an idea of what it's called and how I could find it ?
EDIT: 
Unfortunately I don't have a picture of it.  It came with a Milwaukee brand drill he purchased years ago that came in a metal box.
The item in question looks long ( 4 inches about ) and thin ( pencil like ) with one end for the chuck and the other for the bit.  The cylinder is smooth with no other features or adjustments like I would expect with a torque adjustable style. For a while I always thought the drill was broken because I didn't know that I had to apply pressure to get the bit to spin.

A:

I finally checked out the drill at my inlaws place and it turns out there is a special clutch inside of the drill. My mistake thinking it had something to do with the bit in the drill.
