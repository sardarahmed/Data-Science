Q:

How do you create an organic or chiseled edge on a wood slab?

I am working on a live edge coffee table.  The two long sides are the live edges and look great, and organic, and natural.  The other two sides are boring, flat cuts.  I want to make the two short edges look as beautiful and organic as the live edges.
I have considered going at it with a jigsaw, set to 20 - 30 degrees, and sawing in a curved line.  That should give it a nicer, more organic shape, and match the slop of the live edges, but it's still just going to be a boring, flat cut.  What can I do to make it look more organic.
I thought a draw knife might be some help here but I can barely get a ruffled corner out of it.  I assume a chisel will not actually work as rock chips when chiseled (giving the appearance I'd like), but wood does not.  I'm working with a cherry slab that ranges between 1.5" and 2" thick.

A:

You can get a semi-organic result by using an attachment to the common right angle side grinder, if you are confident of not amputating a limb:

These devices are available from many sources, including HF, although that seems risky in itself. Most side grinders have substantial power to spin the cutter and allow you to contour the edges as you desire. 
The "chip size" is going to be small, but more easily controlled than would be the case if you used a chain saw.
There are a few videos on the YTube of people creating artwork from raw wood. One such video offers other tools, but seems to focus on this specific model:
