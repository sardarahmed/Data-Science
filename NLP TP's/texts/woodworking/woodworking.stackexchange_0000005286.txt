Q:

What do you call this piece of hardware with spurs and female threads?

Can someone please tell me what this is called. It came out of a rather cheaply made cat window perch. I wanted to make one more sturdy (other than 1/8" chip board!) but wanted to use this type fastener if possible to go with the other hardware that came with the perch. 
Thanks so much!

A:

That's a threaded insert, specifically a tee-nut with spurs. It is designed to be inserted from the opposite side of a drilled hole and accept a bolt; the spurs dig in to keep it from spinning as the bolt is tightened. Threaded inserts are sometimes used for strength, but more often are used where a connection may be assembled and disassembled (or tightened and loosened) many times and the designer doesn't want it to wear out as it would if a screw was used that way.
