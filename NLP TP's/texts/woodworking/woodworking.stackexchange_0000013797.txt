Q:

How to determine minimum width of cabinet door stiles and rails?

This is my first time making cabinet doors with inset glass.  The width of the doors will be about 18 1/2" and the height will be about 30".  These are shaker style doors with a single middle cross piece.  I am using 3/4" poplar for the wood.  I will be routing a rabbet for the glass to sit in.  The glass will be 1/8" thick.
The customer would like the stiles and rails of the door to be as thin as possible.  My question is how thin can I make the stiles and rails and still have enough strength to support the weight of the glass and be a fairly sturdy door?  Ideally she would like 1" wide rails and stiles.  But I am starting to be concerned that if the rails and stiles are that thin they won't be able to support the weight of the glass.  Is there any sort of formula or guide used to determine this type of thing?

A:

Nobody can answer this definitively unless they’ve tried it (I haven’t, for the record), but every time I get an edge case like this, I think to myself, “self, have I ever seen this in the wild?” Then, after I answer myself in the negative, I wonder how come?
One answer is that trades are notoriously conservative because they don’t want their work to break and cause a callback that’ll cost them all of the profit from the job.
Another is that we might lack imagination.
Anyway, to 1” rails: I think it’s insane. All the contractual clauses in the world dumping liability onto the client won’t matter a bit when they drag you on every review site they can find because “your” cabinet doors sagged and one even broke, sending shards of glass across the floor.
Maybe metal is the way to go. It’s strong enough.
Ps, use tempered glass.
