Q:

Making shaped legs with varying diameters

I'd like to build a table which has these antique-style legs. However I'm still a beginner in woodworking and have no idea how I could create legs like these. Which tools and techniques would allow me to do this?

A:

The main piece of equipment you'd need is a lathe. It's a fairly significant investment in time and money. The process of making pieces with this tool is usually called "turning".
Your workpiece is clamped between the headstock and tailstock and the lathe's electric motor spins the wood at a high rate of speed allowing a tool (typically supported by the tool rest) to remove unwanted wood along the length of the workpiece. (See the second picture.)

Additionally, you'll need a collection of tools (gouges, scrapers, parting tools, etc.) to make the different shapes and curves along the length of the legs. Other tools will be needed to accurately replicate the profile across multiple legs.

Alternatively
There's another solution for someone who's just looking to make a single piece of furniture or to complete a couple of projects.
You can purchase pre-made, turned legs in various lengths and styles for furniture projects from retail suppliers. It isn't considered good form to make specific shopping recommendations here, but you can find many choices by firing up your favorite search engine and searching for "turned legs for furniture" or something similar.
