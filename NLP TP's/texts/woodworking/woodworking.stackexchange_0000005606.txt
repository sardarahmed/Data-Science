Q:

How to cut and join "wedges" of plywood to form a perfect circle

My wife wants a new dining room table -- a round one of about 4.5' in diameter.
I am constructing it out of rift sawn white oak. I will be using 3/4" ply for the table top (MDF core) and then laminate bending white oak around the edge (circumference), possibly with a strip of walnut in there as well.
My question has to do with the ply wood. In essence I want to create a pattern similar to this one:

As you can see, it appears to have 12 separate "wedges", with the grain running towards the center. I have searched the web to no avail as to how to create a table top like this. So my question:
How do I go about cutting and assembling 12 different "wedges" of 3/4" ply into a perfect circle?

A:

Don't make the wedges out of plywood, but rather make them out of veneer. This allows you to have a solid tabletop, but still get the design you want. 
There is a video series by GuysWoodshop (think this project was a viewer project on Matt Cremona's channel) showing almost exactly what you're trying to do.
