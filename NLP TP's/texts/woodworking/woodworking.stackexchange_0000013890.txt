Q:

How do I achieve this edge with a router?

I'm essentially restoring a bathroom in a 1920s house and I'm trying to be as true to the original woodwork as I can (as a novice).
I'm using my dad's old router for the first time ever and so far it's been going OK (not perfect, but OK).
One edge that I haven't been able to figure out is the edge of the window sill. It's got sort of an "S" shape (if you cut off the bottom third and the top right downward curve).
The convex portion of the curve at the top goes 180Â° around and is definitely a 1/4" radius curve and I think maybe that the concave lower portion is perhaps a 1/2" radius curve.
I went to Home Depot and lowes to try and find a bit (or bits) that I could use to do this. The closest thing I found was a 1/4" radius Roman bit that could do the bottom of the sill (though the radius isn't right for that) and I thought maybe I could find a 1/2" radius one, but when I thought about it, I realized that in doing the top 1/4" curve (if I've already done the bottom curve), there would be nothing for the bearing to guide the second cut. I'd have the reverse issue if I did the top curve first.
So how do I do this?

Edit:
Someone suggested that I mount the router underneath a plywood table. However, I do not immediately see a way to mount it. There are screws underneath the rods that I could use, but they are metal screws, not wood screws. Could I use the holes on the guide attached to the rods to screw it into the side of a table?

A:

I might try an Ogee bit with a board upside down and then use a 1/4 radius after that 'on the top'.  Should be able to get this pretty close with the right Ogee bit, probably a bigger one.
I'm sure I've seen single bits close to that, I have this finger pull door pull that is 'close' but a bit more aggressive on the 'bottom'.  https://www.google.com/shopping/product/13986480099114392013?q=router+bits+door+pull+freud&prds=eto:13639532660545370309_0,pid:9685896006746805321,rsk:PC_10815388883686490806.  I'll keep looking to see if I can find another.  The finger pull might be pushing a full 1" board.

A:

Create accurate profile of edge using gauge or playing cards held by rubber band.

Draw profile on both ends of short test board.
Remove most excess wood on table saw, stay outside lines.
Round off top edge with plane or by sanding, start with 60 or 80.
Make scratch stock from scraps of hardwood.
Draw bottom of profile on steel with Sharpie, file to shape, hone
Scrape bottom curve using scratch stock

After checking new work matches old:

Cut new sill board slightly long.
Repeat all steps on new sill.
Complete by sanding profile to same grit as used on top surface.
Trim both ends.
