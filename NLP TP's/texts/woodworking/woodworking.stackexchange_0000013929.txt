Q:

How to clamp a fence for a router on a narrow piece of wood

I have a few dados to make with a router on MDF boards.
The boards are 28 to 40 cm (11" to ~15 3/4") wide, and lengthwise they range from 80 cm to 250 cm (~31 1/2" to ~98 7/16").
I'm looking for good ways to clamp a fence for my router.
By good way, I mean: that doesn't interfere with the router when I'm routing, and that's easy to set up regardless of the location of the dado along the length of the board.
The router is a Makita RT0700C with the three bases that come standard 
Here is the basic setup that shows the relative dimensions of the workbench, the piece of wood I'm working on, the desired locations of the dados, and why I can't just clamp both ends of the fence easily.

A:

I presume you're routing the groves across the short direction of the long brown board.
Use an edge clamping guide such as this inexpensive one from Harbor Freight:
*No endorsement intended or implied, it's just an example. Actual link for more details
This type of guide will sit flat on the piece that you're routing and has clamps that will grip the edge of the piece being worked on. The clamp pads are pretty low profile, in the range of 1/2 - 3/4", so they should be able to grip onto the edges of your stock without hitting the work surface below.
If, for some reason, the clamp pads are too thick and hit the work surface, clamp a narrower piece of wood to the work surface, clamp your work piece on top of the narrower piece, then you'll have clearance to use the clamp pads on this tool. Something like this:
  +----------+     Clamp
  |xxxxxxxxxx|     Clamp pads around thin work piece
  |  aaaaaa  |     Clamp pads hanging below work piece, over extra piece
=================  Work table

IMHO, it's easier to use the round base for something like this because it's round. If you accidentally twist the router against the guide, you're still the same distance from the center of the cut. If you use a base with a flat side and accidentally twist the router a bit, you've moved the bit further from the center line you're intending to cut and, therefore, ruin the piece.
I've used edge guide clamps like these (again, not this particular brand) for circular saw cuts and for router cuts for close to 30 years. They work extremely well.
