Q:

How should I orient a spline along a long edge join?

I glued up a 4' long dresser top last night, and ended up using a 1/4" spline to line up the two 12" wide sub-panels into one 24" wide one.
I was using pine quarter-sawn boards, and for the spline I just ripped a 1/4" wide strip from the end of one of the panels, since I had made them a bit oversized. So the spline had the same grain direction as the panels, except the growth rings are rotated 90Â°. Unfortunately I didn't really think about spline grain direction while I was gluing it up.

Am I going to run into problems with my 3/4" wide spline expanding enough to crack the center joint on my table?
In the future, is it critical that I manufacture a long spline for an edge join with grain perpendicular, like in the image below? It seems like a huge hassle, since I'd have to have a super wide board or use dozens of little spline chunks.

A:

The spline will expand at the same rate as the board it is in, if the grain is running parallel to the grain in the board, so there shouldn't be a problem.  The reason splines are better when the grain is perpendicular to the join is for strength - wood will split along the grain much easier than it will break across it.
Normally, in a panel glue up like you describe, the spline is only used for alignment, not strength.  The edge grain to edge grain glue bond will be plenty strong alone.   I will use splines, biscuits, dominos, or dowels on this type of glue up just for alignment purposes.
