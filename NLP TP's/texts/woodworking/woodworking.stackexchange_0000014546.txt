Help diagnosing rattling sound table saw

My table saw (Elektra Beckum PKF255 ) makes a strange metallic sounding rattling noise and I can't seem to figure out where it is coming from.
Here's the sound with the new freud blade:

And here's the (acceptable) sound with the original blade:

Here's the sound without blade:

The sound only really occurs with the thicker new blade, which has alternating top bevels (ATB). With the original blade it only occurs for a brief moment when the saw gets up to speed.
The sound does not occur when the motor is stopped.
There is no contact between blade and table as far as I can see or hear upon manually rotating the blade. I have increased the gap between the blade and the table top to be sure.
Without the blade on there's a slight noise from a loose washer, but I've check this and that washer is supposed to be loose to allow for the tilting motor.
What could I do to further diagnose this problem?
Update
Something's definitely still loose inside the motor but I can't access it from the slot. Would it be a good idea to remove the motor using the bolts shown on this picture? https://i.postimg.cc/1tHKtcTd/IMG-0817.jpg

A:

There was a tiny bit of play around the arbor. The Freud blade arbor hole was not exactly 30mm. Fixed by adding a tiny bit of duct tape.
So, it was indeed the blade. My mistake to fall for that fancy red paint  ;-)
For completeness sake: I also removed the motor, which is the only way to check/adjust belt tension on this machine. Just four bolts holding the motor in place.
Belt was fine. I noticed that there's still a small part vibrating inside of the motor. As it's not affecting the operation of the saw, I decided not to open up the motor.
