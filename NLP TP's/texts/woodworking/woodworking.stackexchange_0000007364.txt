Q:

Securing the cable chain on a CNC gantry

I have laser cut the ends of a bicycle brake cable cable chain platform on a CNC I am building. I have looped the bicycle brake cables around one end and tucked the end of the cable through the loop. There is enough friction that the cables stay reasonably taught, though I suspect during normal use, this would sag. Does anyone have a suggestion about how to secure the ends to prevent slipping? I thought I might solder the cable together, but thought a mechanical option would be better, preferably one that would allow me to easily detach the cables should one of the wood brackets break.

A:

I think I have found the ticket. A cable stop that is 6mm in diameter should just barely fit the clearance between holes. If I alternate the orientation of the bolt on top/bottom, I should be able to tighten with a socket too. Blind dumb luck on the engineering tolerances there. $15.50 with shipping for 5.
