Q:

How to start a cut when using router templates

I have a template and a router, and am told I need a plunge bit. If I put the template on top of the wood, how do I start the hole? Do I cut a hole in the wood to have a starting point then follow the pattern? 

A:

The bit on the left has spiral flutes and a tapered end, so it can plunge (ie, you can press the board straight down over it and it will drill into the wood just like a drill bit).   The bit on the right will not, because it's square on the bottom and does not have a spiraled flute.

Here is the article that is the source of the picture, with an explanation:  http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2014/12/router-mortising/

A:

It really depends on the type of bit you are using. some bits can plunge by resting the edge of the router and letting it cut through. If there is a bearing or non cutting bottom drill a hole with a drill bit large enough to get started and have fun.
