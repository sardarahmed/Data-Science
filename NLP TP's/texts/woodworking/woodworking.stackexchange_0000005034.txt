Q:

What is the best way to transport (ply)wood on the roof of a vehicle?

I just bought an SUV, so I can now transport boards much more easily than in my sedan. However, the SUV is not big enough to fit 4x8' or 5x5' sheet goods, even with the 2nd and 3rd row seats folded down. I may be able to tilt the sheet goods, but that still may not fit. 
I do have roof racks, so thought that might be a better way to go. I worry about wind getting under the sheet goods and lifting them, though, especially since my hardwood dealer is ~20 miles away via highways. 
Is there a good way to tie sheet goods to an SUV roof rack, that would prevent them from lifting up from wind? Or is there a jig I can build to more safely transport wood on the roof rack? 

A:

Drive Very Slowly, and Do Not Overload. The Car Talk guys have a story about a friend who sheared off most of the front of his car when he stopped suddenly but the pile of plywood on the roof didn't.
Personal recommendations:
Install a proper roof rack, secure strongly to that without exceeding it's cargo rating, consider a leading airfoil, and drive slow. 
Or tTpransport plywood inside the vehicle. Cut it down to rough sizes first if full sheets won't fit. Mist yards have panel saws and will make some number of cuts free or cheap.
If it still wouldn't fit, borrow a van or pickup, rent a truck or pay to have it delivered to site.
The risks from doing it wrong greatly exceed the cost of doing it right.

A:

I transport 4x8 plywood on my roof racks, I usually run a couple of 2x4s under the roof racks the full length of the ply and strap to those at the front and back as well as strapping to the actual roof racks. Makes it a lot harder for the winds to lift it up.
