Q:

How can I safely cut this thin stock with a small angle on a right tilting table saw?

I am replacing the meeting rail on some wood windows due to damage. I need to make a a roughly 36" strip that is this cross-section: 

How can I safely cut this on a right-tilting table?  It's also important to keep the angle consistent since it interfaces with a meeting face. 
My initial idea is to make the cut using 3/4" stock using a thin push-stick. But, this seems potentially dangerous with the blade tilting towards the fence. 

A:

Cut the bevel on a wide board, then set the fence to 3/4 and rip off the work piece with a straight blade.  Hold the large offcut when making the cut.  Flip the work piece so the wide edge is up and referencing off the middle of the fence, not sliding under it.
Or
Get a piece of stock much longer than you need, stop your cut when you are past the length you need but well before the end of your stock.  (Turn off the saw and wait for the blade to spin down.  Don't try to back it out.)  Then crosscut the piece you need off of the extra long stock.
Or
Determine your cut distance for the work piece on the left of the blade (use a temporary stop-block), then slide the fence against the large offcut on the right of the blade.  Make the cut holding the offcut against the fence.
