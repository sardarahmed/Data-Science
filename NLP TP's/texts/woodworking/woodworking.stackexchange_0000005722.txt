Fixing gloopy shellac

So I got a little carried away applying shellac for the first time and didn't wait long enough between coats.  The result was a gloopy looking, cloudy surface.  On the paduak the coat actually looks like runny peanut butter in some places ...
Should I scrape off the excess and apply one final light coat, or sand it?
edit:
Apparently the denatured alcohol can dissolve foam brushes.  I am guessing this is where the nasty looking color is coming from.  I guess I should scrape it down to the wood and start fresh with a cut up t-shirt ...

A:

I would sand it and begin again. For brushing, I see folks recommending fine nylon brushes but I prefer a fine China bristle brush when I'm not spraying. Here's some recommendations I make with shellac.
Most commercially prepared shellac is typically a 3 lb. cut and should be diluted before brushing. This will allow the first coat a bit more penetration. But more importantly, it helps you work faster on subsequent coats. Like lacquer, shellac dissolves the underlying layers as you apply additional coats. If you "work" it too much you will drag underlying material and create uneveness.
Be absolutely sure the shellac is fresh. I usually mix my own from flakes for guitar work but the Zinsser brand is OK for less critical applications. Try to find stock less than 6 months old. They used to date the cans but how use a code. Here's a link to "decode": https://woodworkersedge.wordpress.com/2012/07/15/decode-your-shellac/
