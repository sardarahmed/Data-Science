Q:

Is the weight of a board a good proxy for moisture content?

I've been working out a process to mill usable lumber from some trees that fell on my property.  They are all either maple or cherry.  Most of what I've read said to allow one year of drying time per inch of thickness and I've been following that.
However, in one video I watched, then man weighed his boards on a scale and wrote down the numbers.  He said if the weight stays the same over the course of one week, then the board is ready to use.  I have not seen that repeated anywhere else, so I'm looking for second opinions. Is that a reliable way to know if I can start using my lumber for projects?
I should also mention that in my case, I'm talking about pretty small boards.  No more than 6 inches wide and a maximum of 30 inches in length, with varying thicknesses of 1 to 1.5 inches.

A:

one way to use weight of a board for measuring moisture content is to take a sample, weight it (accurately) put it in the oven at around 225, cook it for a while 2-3 hours? (depends on how green it is) then weigh it again.
This will tell you what was the total moisture content of the wood.
After weight/before weight.
By putting it in the oven like this it can reduce the moisture content to 0, it of course ruins the board for anything else, which is why you want a smaller sample, but it will tell you what the moisture content is. of the rest of the boards.  if it is stacked and stickered, you will probably need a couple samples from different areas.
an alternate option is to buy a moisture meter, a decent one costs less than $200 and for anyone cutting their own lumber (or having it cut for them) a moisture meter is worth every penny.
