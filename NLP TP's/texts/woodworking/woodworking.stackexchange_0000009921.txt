Q:

How to prevent short off-cuts from flying everywhere?

I am mitering some 21" boards for picture frames using a tablesaw. The first cut leaves a small off-cut to the right of the blade. Sometimes it goes flying, or even gets caught between the blade and blade throat cover. I am pushing the boards through with a mitre gauge. I cannot push the mitre gauge all the way past the blade as the off-cut then gets caught (drops into) in the slot past the blade, and prevents the mitre gauge from any more travel in its slot. Any ideas how to do this safely?

A:

Make or buy a zero tolerance insert for your tablesaw.  This will give cleaner cuts, and not give a place for the off cuts to drop into.
