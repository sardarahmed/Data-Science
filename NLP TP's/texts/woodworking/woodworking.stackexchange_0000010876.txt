Q:

Advice on safely storing chemicals outside

I am setting up my new home shop and am considering a smallish yellow metal chemical safe to store alcohol, varnish, etc.
I am wondering if I would not be better off for fire safety and indoor air quality just storing this all outside of the house on a shaded north face of my house.

A:

Billions of chemicals are stored correctly and safely indoors all over the planet.
If it does not freeze or get very hot in your area and you can safely lock it up to prevent children or pests from access them then go for it. Temperature is a consideration for some chemicals.
