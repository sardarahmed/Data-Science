Q:

Pulling out of a cut on a table saw

I recognise that this is a very elementary question but I’m new to table saws and no amount of googling has given me an answer to my question (I’m probably using the wrong terms). I want to cut a half lap joint on the end of some 4 by 2. Quite a long piece. What I think I will need to do is a 2 inch cut, pull the work piece back off the blade. Flip it upside down so that I can then complete the cut on the other side (as the blad is not tall enough to cut the full four inches.
My question, is pulling the workpiece back off the blade seen as being dangerous? I assume it is but then how do you make a cut when you don’t want to rip the full length of a plank?

A:

I think a table saw is the wrong tool for this job.  Trying to precisely manipulate a large piece of wood is always tricky; you can easily slip and damage the workpiece or you.
What I would do is:

Clamp the long piece of 2x4 to a work bench.
Repeatedly cut across the 2x4 with a circular saw set to very slightly less than the depth you want to remove.
Knock out the waste wood with a chisel
Lay a couple of pieces of scrap 2x4 next to the workpiece, and use a router to precisely finish off the joint.

The hand-tools version of the above is using a tenon saw to make the cross cuts, and then a chisel to pare down to the exact depth. I might well do the paring down with a chisel even now.
