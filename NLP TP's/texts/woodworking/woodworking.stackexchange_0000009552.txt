Q:

Does the final coat of a Danish Oil finish need to be wiped?

Does the final coat (in this case third) of Danish Oil have to be wiped?  Or is it not OK to just let dry and then lightly sand/buff?
I ask because I am using the dark walnut version of the Watco product, which was applied very thinly, and currently have the exact color match I want, but if I wipe it down it will remove some of the solids and thereby lighten up the finish.
I'd like to not have to keep reapplying.

A:

Keep wiping.  You might be able to keep your wiping rag in a jar with a lid.  Keep it wet with the oil, and twice a day, wipe the surface with it to add another thin layer.
The danger with not wiping is having a thicker puddle or streak on it.  This will turn into a stripe of gummy junk.
With most drying oils, UV light will hasten the drying.
Note:  Colour matching can be tricky.  You can get a perfect match in one light, say under the fluorescents in your shop, and find that the match is nowhere near close under sunlight or under halogen light.
