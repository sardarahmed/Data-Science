Q:

What is this type of sail boat hull construction?

I am very slightly familiar with different type of sail boat/yacht hull construction. But this examples one on the pictures below are something that I do not quite understand.
First pic:

This I find puzzling. First it appears there are some bulkheads. Longitudinal "stringers" are fixed to them. I presume their only purpose is to define the hull shape, sort of like a spline. On this "stringers" the vertical frames are attached. This I presume will stay as structure of the boat. And i guess on top of this frames comes the planking. Then another assumption from me: inner bulkheads and "stringers" are removed so only frames and planking remain? Am I correct or wrong. Actually I would like this thing explained to me.

This looks very similar but on closer inspection I think longitudinal stringer are actual pieces of final planking. But I might be wrong.
This might be the same boat with planking.

So, at least the first pic shows the type of construction I do not understand. What is it?

A:

If you examine the second picture, you will see that the "underlying" longitudinal members (inside the ribs) in the first picture are just part of the mold which the vertical members (ribs) are attached to in bending/forming. They stay there and the next hull's vertical members are formed on them. That mold sets the shape of the hull for all boats built on it.
The longitudinal support on the finished hull comes from the planking attached to the outside of the ribs. The longitudinal members outside the ribs in the second picture may be some of those planks, but are more likely to be temporary braces to permit the ribs to stay in place until planking is attached, which will be removed as the planking gets to each one. Managing the joints between boards is difficult enough without adding trying to meet up with 10 or more boards already fixed in place.
