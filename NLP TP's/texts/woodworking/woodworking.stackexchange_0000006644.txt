Q:

Can this table support 150 KG?

Ich currently have a 60l aquarium on my cupboard which weighs approx 85 kgs. I want to upgrade to a 100 liter aquarium which will weigh approx 140 - 150 kgs and wanted to be on the safe side and ask for your opinion.   Thickness of board under aquarium is 3 cm while two wooden legs are 1.5 cm. On 4 sides the main board which is under aquarium is supported by screws to main wooden pillars which are 4 cm each. .  I am adding pics as well. 

A:

Properly speaking, this question can't be answered. (Unless you can find the manufacturer and ask them...)
However, I have a few ideas to offer. From a design standpoint, you have two relatively solid uprights supporting the weight. That's a good thing.
I can't really comment on the rigidity of the entire unit, but if you feel brave, remove the existing aquarium and have 2 adults climb onto where the new aquarium would be (stand over the uprights). If it felt solid, I'd assume that the structure would hold up.
If you do change the aquarium, pay special attention in the first month to see if there's any curving/bowing in the uprights, or sagging in the horizontal shelf.
