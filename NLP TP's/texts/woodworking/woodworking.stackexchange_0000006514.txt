Q:

Kanna setup: blade/mouth width, osae-bo bending

I'm in the process of setting up my first kanna. I'm facing two problems:

The blade is wider than the mouth, it overlaps the mimi and chips get stuck there (see picture). What is the correct way to remedy this? I would like to avoid grinding the blade to make it narrower.

The osae-b≈ç is bending when I hammer the chip-breaker to its proper position. I assume this is problematic. How shall I proceed? Do I need to file down or bend the mimi of the chip-breaker?

A:

Most kanna irons that I have seen have their own mimi formed by grinding off the corners so the cutting edge is the same width as the mouth. As it is now the iron is cutting a shaving that is wider than the throat. No wonder it chokes.
I see a gap between the pin and the chipbreaker. The gap should be convex and not concave so the pin can exert an even pressure at its centre.

The best source of information I have found is the Craftsmanship in Wood forum on Chris Hall's blog. Find it here http://thecarpentryway.blogspot.ca/
There are some good beginner videos by sumokun on youtube.
Best of luck,
John
