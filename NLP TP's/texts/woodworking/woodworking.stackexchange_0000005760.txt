Q:

Color cross-contamination after sanding

I'm a novice woodworker making a knife handle from two different woods. The front and back of the handle are Indian rosewood, while the middle part is birch root. During sanding, it looks like some dust from the darker wood is getting embedded in the pale wood. Is there a way to prevent this or clean it up before applying the finish?
I've attached a picture showing the discolored wood next to the block from which it was cut.

A:

Have you moved up the solvent ladder to lacquer thinner or acetone?  That rosewood is oily, and you've likely got to break down that oil to dislodge those particles and dissolve any pigment.  Or - just a shot in the dark - maybe a little household bleach, or even oxalic acid (wood bleach, found at Box Stores).
