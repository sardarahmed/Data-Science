Q:

Kind of wood with deep brown streaks?

I was in the Field Museum a couple of weeks ago and at the end of the new China exhibit is the "Cyrus Tang" spirit stone display. The wood flooring was extremely interesting, being a blond wood with heavy streaks of dark brown:

What kind of wood is this?

A:

The image you have came from the Field Museum obviously. In trying to look for plans or a source as to what the floor was made of I found a "case study" from the manufacturer that talks about the wood used in the exhibit. The quote from the site reads like an ad but it does talk about the flooring specifically used.

The exhibit also features PlybooStrand (Neopolitan) for the flooring. Plyboo was a perfect fit for this exhibit, as it comes from the Moso bamboo forests of China. A sustainable building material, it is made from 100% FSC-certified bamboo, which is rapidly renewable and free of urea formaldehyde. Plyboo is also extremely durable, an important consideration for such a heavy-trafficked environment.

It was easy after that to find the product page for the flooring quoted.

And as Treow Wyrhta's answer shows this is not wood but an engineered wood product. So in this case there is no grey area about the wood in question.

A:

Apparently it is a not a hard wood, but a synthetic bamboo plywood. The manufacturer, Intectural, describes it as:

PlybooStrand uses strand technology to turn 100% rapidly renewable
  bamboo into a beautiful yet exceptionally durable green building
  material for both commercial and residential use. Strand differs from
  typical bamboo material in that the bamboo is not cut into strips and
  laminated, but instead thrashed and pressed into dense logs. The logs
  are sliced and fabricated into plywood, creating a harder, denser
  material with an entirely new bamboo aesthetic.
