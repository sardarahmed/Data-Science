Advice for setting screws in dense wood

The Janka Hardness Test provides a scale for the hardness of woods. Toward the higher end, wood can be particularly difficult to drive screws into and even a pilot hole may not be adequate. Is there a good method for firmly setting screws into a work-piece without snapping the head?
Approximately where on the scale would these extra measures become necessary?

A:

Your milage will vary.  I think it will depend on a lot of factors beyond the wood - type of screw used, screw head, method of driving them, temperature, etc.
Some ways to make it easier to drive and avoid snapping the screw are:

Larger pilot hole
Larger screw, if possible (with a larger pilot hole)
Lubricate the screws - a bar of soap works well
Select a screw that does not cam out (slip out and strip the head) easily - robertson, torx, pozidriv
Choose a screw made from a harder material - avoid brass
Use an impact driver to drive the screw
Use a screw with a higher number of threads per inch

A:

I cannot attest for at which point the woods hardness come into play but the type 17 (The type is describing the point) screw which was designed for quick penetration and can effectively remove the need for pilot holes. They are typically found in decking. I use them when I get my hard oak pallets as I have lost bits, nails and screws in that wood.

If you take a listen to a gentleman on YouTube he would suggest you use a bar of hand soap to lubricate the screw. The man in the video only talks about lubrication but in theory that should help prevent overheating which makes the screw more malleable and susceptible to breaking.
