Q:

Is a wet/dry shop vacuum (5HP) noisier than a 3/4HP dust collector?

I have a 5HP vacuum that is connected to a Ridgid 3650 table saw. It seems that it is not perfect and sawdust is still present on the floor even after minor work.
I was thinking about buying a 3/4 portable dust collector and trying to see if this will improve the situation

I have read various posts by others who tried this and the situation is not improving radically. The dust collector is on sale now so I would buy it as a permanent solution (I am using the vacuum for many other things) and if the noise is lower I would buy the dust collector.
Is a dust collector less noisy than a vacuum?

A:

Dust collectors are high cfm with lower negative pressure, where as a shop vac is lower cfm and higher negative pressure. Most of the large shop vacs have been more noisy or at least a more irritating sound then my small dust collector. That one appears to be the same as the one I have from Harbor Freight, it has worked well for the limited amount of use it has had. Draw back does not catch the very fine particles. Do Not use a small hose but rather use a 4" hose with an adapter if necessary.
