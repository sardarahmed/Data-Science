Q:

What types of table saw cuts cannot be made with a riving knife installed?

Similar to When is it not possible or not practical to use a blade guard?, what types of cuts require the riving knife (and blade guard) to be removed?

A:

Although there are many instances in which you need to remove a standard or modular table saw blade guard, most cuts can be made with a riving knife installed. However, there are a few operations for which you must (or should) remove the riving knife:

Raising the blade through a workpiece (e.g., when cutting the slot for a crosscut sled or zero-clearance insert)
Using a dado stack (the riving knife does not perform its duty and, in fact, will probably block your workpiece; for example, if installing an 8" or 6" dado stack along with a riving knife intended for a 10" blade)
Cutting coves

Also keep in mind that your riving knife must be approximately the same thickness as your blade. If you use a standard-kerf riving knife with a thin-kerf blade, your workpiece may be blocked by the riving knife or may pinch it, or may be pinched between the riving knife and fence. Conversely, if you use a thin-kerf riving knife with a standard-kerf blade, your riving knife will not be as effective at preventing kickback.
