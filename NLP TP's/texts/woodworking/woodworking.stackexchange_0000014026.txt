Q:

What is this tool that looks a bit like a dough scraper but with a sharp cutting edge?

What is this tool?  It has a turned wooden handle atop a large straight blade with a semicircular cutout for the fingers.  The blade is 7 inches long and 4 inches deep.
Were it not for the cutout from the blade and were the blade not sharp, it could be used as a dough scraper.  Since the blade is sharp but not very long and has 90 degree corners, I assume it is intended to cut down through something relatively soft with a pushing action (as opposed to a slicing action back and forth).
There is a damaged label on the handle, which looks as if it may read (with "_" marking unclear letters) "_ICH_ST____ADE".
I am asking this here because I acquired the tool amongst a set of woodworking tools in a joiner's box and as such consider that it is may be a woodworking tool or a least a tool used by a woodworker.

A:

It looks like a "herb chopper" to me

Pictured are a variety of antique herb choppers. Two of them look a lot like the tool you have - the two in the middle against the wall.
There are a variety of styles for herb choppers. There is no standard design for a herb chopper.
When I search for "vintage herb chopper" I get some results that a good match for your tool.
When I search for "dough scrapers" or "vintage dough scrapers" I get no results that look like your tool.
It's reasonable to assume it's a woodworking tool since you found it amongst other woodworking tools.
However, as my wife would confirm with an annoyed tone of voice, sometimes kitchen tools find their way into my toolbox.
