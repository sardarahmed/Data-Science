Q:

Triple flute drill bits Vs. 2 flute drill bits

I have found some triple flute drill bits and am wondering if they are any better than the double flute. I would think they make cleaner cuts but am sure there is some bad things that go along with it. Anything about this is helpful. 

A:

They cut faster and cleaner. Negatives that I know of is cost (they are more expensive) and heat. They will heat up quicker because there is less steel there. Too much heat and your bit is dead.
