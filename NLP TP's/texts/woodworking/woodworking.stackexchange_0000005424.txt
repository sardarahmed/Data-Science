Q:

Planing boards with the nearly useless hand-held power planer

I have a cheap 3 1/4" hand-held power planer, and some 4x4s that I'd like to plane down about 1/16" on all four sides to square up the corners. Normally, I'd do this on the table saw, but my saw is out of service at the moment, and my hacked-together upside-down-circular-saw-in-MDF version isn't big enough to cut all the way through the 4x4. (It also wobbles, which isn't great.)
The issue I'm having is that, since the planer is narrower than the board, I get a lovely step / ridge in the middle. I've tried setting the fence so that I can plane half of the board at the time, but this gives results best described as "amateur hour."
Suggestions?

A:

Our jobsite saw only gives about 2 1/2 depth of cut.  It's also just your standard 15 amp direct drive, so it doesn't like to be stressed. Fine for 99% of our site work.  On the rare occasion we have to rip timbers we start with a shallow cut and gradually raise the blade in two or three passes.  Flip and repeat.  a 6 x 6 will leave about 1/2 or so in the center.  Provided the faces were reasonably straight and flat - else you have to joint one face.  We then turn to the trusty Harbor Freight portable electric planer to hog the ridge close.  Finish up by hand, with the Ulmia that out of the box in 1981 cost 5x more than the HF planer :).  Needed: 2 Guys, aforementioned tools, sawhorses, 5 minutes.
