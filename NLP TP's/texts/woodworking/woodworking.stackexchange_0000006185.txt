Q:

How to square a long board

I have a 10in craftsman table saw with the fence. How would I square up the sides of a 1x6x4ft board? Would i need jig of some kind. Or would using circular with a straight edge be better.  Mainly looking for proper technique using a table saw.  Thanks. 

A:

Unless you already have a straight edge on your board, your fence will just replicate the errors of one edge to the other.  What you need is a straight edge jig. It's fairly easy to build.  Here's an example from the Wood Magazine. 

There's also many videos on YouTube.
