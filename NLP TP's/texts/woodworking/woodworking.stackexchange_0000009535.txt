Q:

What can cause cracks in painted pine?

I'm taking an online woodworking course (The Weekend Woodworker), and built a small patio table a few months ago. I made it out of select pine (kiln dried), spray painted it (~2 coats), and put in on my back deck. Being the first thing I've ever made, I was (and still am) pretty proud of my efforts! However, I noticed today that the top of the table is already cracking:

What could be causing this? The deck is south facing, and gets a ton of sunshine all day, so perhaps it's a UV thing? I also note that water sits on top of the table after it rains, as if the top boards are cupped a little (I did indeed sand the top). I try to dump the water off each time this happens, but I'd like to know what (if anything) I did wrong.

A:

The end grain is much quicker at aborbing water than either the face or edge grain.  So the end of the board sucks up the water.  The board tries to expand, but the dry wood further from the end constrains it's motion.  So the force crushes the wood fibers.
Board dries out, and the wood shrinks.  But now the crushed fibers take up less room.  Wood splits.  
As the wood splits, water can use the splits to get in further.  So the splits gradually move in from the ends.
Prevention:  Saturate the ends of the boards with whatever finish you are using.  Sometimes cut ends are in difficult to reach places after construction.  I suggest doing as much of the finishing before assembly as possible, as this will also take care of places where boards overlap.
