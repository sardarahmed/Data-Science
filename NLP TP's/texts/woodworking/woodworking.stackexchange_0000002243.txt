Q:

How can I turn a couple of logs into stubby legs for a outdoor tree round table?

I want to create legs for an outdoor cedar tree round table.  I'd like the table top to be 18" to maybe 20" high.  
How might I securely attach these legs to the tree round?  
The tree round is 4' in diameter, and roughly 14" thick.  So it's already 14" high.  I am turning this into an outdoor table to put under a covered area.  I also have four cedar logs from 8" to 12" in diameter.  
I was thinking that I would cut the logs into short round legs, just striping the bark and chopping them off at 4" or 6" tall.  The idea was that they that would stand on their own, I would position them appropriately and then set the tree round table top on top of these.  A table. 
It has since been pointed out, that if the table were to fall off its legs, even at 4" or 6", it might hurt someone.

A:

Hrmm, my first thought would be to drill a couple of 2" holes in the 'legs' and the underside of the 'top' and make some 2" dowels to connect the two, but I'd wonder if as these things dry whether or not that would crack.
Another option would be to take a sheet of 3/4" exterior grade plywood, lay ot over the bottom of the table 'top', trace it, then grab a compass and set it for a couple inches, and scribe the the profile a couple of inches back toward the center. Then use a jigsaw to trim the plywood to this smaller size. 
Use the plywood as a stand-in to mount the legs to with lots of wood screws, then set the 'top' over this base, and screw from the bottom up using the same screws (say 3" wood screws, not drywall screws.)
Oh, and I'd defintiely cut the center of the plywood to keep from creating a pocket where water could collect.
