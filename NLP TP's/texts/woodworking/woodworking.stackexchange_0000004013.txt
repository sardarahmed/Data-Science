Q:

High gloss finish for wooden sign

I am currently making a wooden sign with lots of details in it for interior use. I usually finish those with a coat of danish oil, but for a change, I wanted to apply a high gloss finish. My main concern is the amount of details in the sign which would be hard to apply a finish uniformly to them, plus reaching the depth of the v-carved details.
Is there a finish which is easy to apply and forgiving which would achieve this?

A:

Many high gloss finishes such as varnish, lacquer and shellac can be sprayed (either from a can or a HVLP) which makes applying it to irregular surfaces a bit easier compared to brushing. That said there is no reason you couldn't achieve the results you are looking for with a brush and some patience. 
Thinning the finishes will also make it easier to get the finish to flow into the detailed areas but will require more coats.
