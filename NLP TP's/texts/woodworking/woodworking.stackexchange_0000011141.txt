Q:

Clearance hole for partially threaded screws

I have heard some people say that one doesn't have to drill a clearance hole if the screws are partially threaded when joining two boards. The argument being that the shank just won't grip into the first board at all and there won't be a risk of bridging.
But I have noticed on my projects that the shank is often much too short to clear the first board.
So my question is, if the shank doesn't fully clear the first board, and the upper thread is still gripping into the first board, do I need a clearance hole in the first board to ensure the two boards remain tightly together?

A:

Wood screws work best as clamping devices. That is, no part of the screw fastener should engage with the top piece, leaving only the head of the screw to clamp the top piece to the bottom piece.
This implies that, ideally, you drill two sizes of holes: pilot holes for the threads and relief holes for the shank.
It follows that for those cases where the threadless shank can't clear the top piece ideally the pilot hole is wide enough such that none of the threads engage except in the piece we are clamping to.
In practice what we often get is nearly none of the thread engaging in the top piece and nearly most of the threads engaging nicely into the bottom piece. This is usually just fine for rough construction (just back out the screw, tighten up the clutch, and drive it in harder) but will never give you the tight clamping you want in woodworking.
The glue-and-screw combination is one of the strongest, convenient, and forgiving joinery we've ever created, but only if you install the fasteners the way they were designed to be installed.
