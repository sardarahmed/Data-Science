Building a table for aquarium

About 6 months ago, I built an aquarium wood table (stand). to build it, I used pine wood 0.63" sheets.
for 5-6 months it was great, though few days ago I noticed that the top sheet that the aquarium is sitting on it - getting bent. I can't understand what is causing this phenomenon! I was thinking maybe the material wasn't good or maybe there's too much pressure on this sheet, so I'm thinking of changing this top sheet to an oak 1" sheet.
what do you think about this problem? how can I solve it? I attach pictures. thanks in advanced for advising,

Judging by the pictures and the movie, I'd say the problem is just warping of the pine boards. The fact that the boards are straight at the center (where they are screwed to the vertical legs) and only the edges are bent suggests that.
It is possible that the aquarium environment is more humid than the rest of the house, making the warping worse. But this can also happen with low quality pine boards that were not thoroughly dried before dimensioning.
I would suggest replacing the pine boards with a high quality marine grade plywood (or at least a plywood sheet that will handle moisture better). If 5/8" pine is enough for the weight of the aquarium, 3/4" plywood should be more than enough, and you could probably go thinner (down to 5/8" or even 1/2"), depending on the full weight of the aquarium (plus water).
If you would like to avoid sheets and go with solid wood (I don't think that the actual wood selection will matter all that much), make sure to fully acclimatize the wood to the aquarium environment before assembly.
