Q:

Why won't my miter saw cut all the way through my work piece?

I have a cheap miter saw. When I saw something the blade does not go all the way through. The blade does not reach entirely between the fence and the bottom, leaving a part uncut. Is this a known problem? Can I adjust some settings on the saw to solve this? Is my saw blade too small?
In this picture, the blade does not reach the red part:

Is this a known problem? 

I can't say but the simplest workaround is probably to install a sacrificial fence to hold the pieces being cut far out enough that the teeth will exit the bottom inside corner. Like this:
