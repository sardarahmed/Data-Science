Q:

How do you make 45 degree cuts in herrigbone cutting boards?

I want to make walnut inlays in a maple board as shown below. How might I make the necessary cuts?
P.S. this picture is from -- https://herringboneboards.com/boards/maple-herringbone-board-with-walnut-inlays/

A:

How might I make the necessary cuts? 

I don't think there are cuts where you think there are. 
The walnut 'inlays' here are not all inlays I'd bet, I can't be sure but I'd bet the boards are built up much as seen, the edges sawn square afterwards and then finally the bowties (AKA butterfly keys or Dutchmen) laid in.
If you look carefully at the picture and the orientation of the maple blocks used to make up the herringbone main field, the walnut pieces could simply be glued in place along the sawtooth edges at the time of construction (with more maple blocks glued outside of them and so on).
The main challenge building up a board in this way would be in clamping it firmly without everything moving around due to the lubrication provided by the glue. Other than using many clamps I think the ideal method might be to build a simple clamping frame on a piece of MDF or plywood to help contain the pieces* and limit the total number of clamps needed. 
If built with care a clamping frame could probably allow a board of this size to be clamped successfully with just four stout clamps, without a clamping frame I think you'd want at least eight and possibly 12 or more.

Also, how do I make those bowtie inlays?

This should be asked as a separate Question.

*An alternative would be custom clamping blocks or cauls.
