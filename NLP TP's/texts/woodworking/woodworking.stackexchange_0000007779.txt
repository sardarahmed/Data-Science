Q:

How to cut 2" wide x 1/2" deep slot in 3" x 1" x 1" soft maple?

I'm a newbie woodworker and the struggle is real. My current project needs me to cut a 2" wide by 1/2" deep slot in a 3" wide by 1" by 1" piece of soft maple. A 2" wide piece of 1/2" plywood will be inserted and glued into the slot.

I have access to a co-op workspace, so assuming I have all the standard power tools, what is the easiest way for me to do this? I tried drilling it out with a drill press and it came out like s**t.
Appreciate any input! 

A:

The traditional way to cut a shallow mortice would be using a Â½" chisel and mallet, it should only take a few minutes.
Setting up a guide-jig for a router would take longer and still need a chisel to clean up the corners.
