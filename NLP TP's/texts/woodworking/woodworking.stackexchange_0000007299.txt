Q:

How to enlarge a hole behind metal bracket?

Despite very accurate measuring and drilling I've ended-up with slight hole misalignment wile building a wooden structure.
While the holes in question have been drilled a bit oversize, that isn't proving to be sufficient in all cases.  Some of the holes are not aligning perfectly on both sides of this large 8 inch wide beam.  
Holes shown in dashed lines below:

I am wondering if anyone knows of an easy technique one could use to enlarge these deep holes.  I can't remove the beams, they weigh about 300 lbs and it's just too much work.  The brackets are about 1/4 inch thick.  Which means it would be a ton of work to drill out the holes in the metal.  It would also destroy the powdercoating.
I'm hoping for some kind of a special boring tool I might not be familiar with that could be inserted into the hole to then enlarge it once past the metal bracket.

A:

The holes are slightly misaligned, which I assume means that the holes in the wood overlap the the holes in the steel.
Your comment to drill from both sides is the solution that I would pursue. I would redrill the holes in the wood using the same diameter as you originally used. The idea is that the hole that you redrill will follow the course of least resistance which may create a hole that is not perfectly straight, but which will meet in the middle of the wood.
You may not be able to simply slip the bolts through the holes but may have to drive them through in order to follow the possible curved path.
If you are comfortable using a Forstner bit in a portable drill use that since it will minimize damage to the powder finish on the steel.  I'm afraid, though, that you will damage the finish and will either have to live with (it's going to hidden and protected by washers or the head of the bolt) or apply some sort of protective paint to the bare metal that will almost certainly appear.
