Q:

How to get writing out of a soft wood desk top

I recently purchased a beautiful office desk made from a soft wood.  Before I could set up proper safeguards, my son laid down a piece of paper and went to writing -- and pressed all of his words into the wood top through the paper.  !!!! What can I do?  

A:

Depending on how damaged the wood fibers are,  you might be able to salvage at least some of it by dampening the area and heating it to swell the fibers. This is commonly done with a wet cloth and hot iron. Use the cleanest cloth and water you can (DI/distilled if possible). Lay the cloth on the wood, then press it with a hot iron. Check your progress every couple seconds, and don't let the cloth dry out - you dont want to discolor anything by burning. It may or may not work, but it's worth a try. You might have to lightly sand the area with ultra fine sandpaper when you'd done (320+ grit) as the water may raise the grain (but first let the area dry out completely and then assess).
