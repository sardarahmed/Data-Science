Q:

filling cracks in tables

I have been up and down the internet looking for a solution for this.
I have a bit of spalted maple that I want to finish in oil.  It has some critter holes and a split that need to be filled.  I would like to fill them with black filler but am having an issue finding something that will fill it and not seep into the surrounding wood pores.
I have tried coffee and CA glue, but it seemed coarse to me, and it spills over into the other parts of the piece.  Grinding the grinds to make them mades the CA flow all over the surface of the work.  PC-Woody, which might take some colours well did not take black mica or charcoal without needing way too much.
Does anyone know a good black filler I can use that wont run into the rest of my project?  I'm not looking for much here just a clean demarcation from the wood to the black filler; shiny or matte does not matter.

A:

Probably the best all-around filler is epoxy.  Most epoxies will dry to an off-white color but they can be tinted to better match the wood.  Depending on the texture you are going for, there are a variety of additives that can be mixed in to change the texture and composition.
West System epoxies are pretty common and a lot of woodworkers use them, though any two-part epoxy will do the job.
