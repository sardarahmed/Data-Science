Q:

Can I get some tips or criticisms of this couch plan?

I drafted this myself in Blender.  Dado joints are depicted, mortise/tenon joints and bolted joints are not.  This is to-scale, planned with douglas fir 2x4s and jute webbing/coil spring/4 way tie construction/ and then tie on cushions.  Dimensions are about 31" x 7.5' x 36".
I have never built a couch (or any furniture) before, but have been studying woodworking a lot, so I am looking mostly for tips on how I might improve this, or especially, if it's structurally weak in any way.

A:

I would build the bottom grid where the cushions sit with mortise and tenon joints.  Then attach it to the back legs and side legs using a dado.  The two short legs shouldn't receive much lateral stress - You can probably get away with just a mortise and tenon joint there.  If you change the orientation of the long horizontal boards, you could eliminate the middle legs all together (a 2x4 will only sag about 0.1 inches with 250 pounds directly in the middle).  I put a 10 degree angle on the back, which is probably too much, but it gives you an idea.
If you attach the back to the base using a glued dado, it isn't going to rack at all.
