Q:

Can a bad mouth plane be saved?

I recently bought a 10$ block plane just because it had a depth adjustment knob unlike the other block plane that I had.
I took it out of the box, carefully took out the blade and sharpened it using my oil stone as good as I could. Then I installed the blade and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't set the blade to protrude evenly across the width of the mouth. I had a similar issue with my other block plane which proved to be the blade not being square (the edge was not at perfectly 90 deg to the sides). 
Looking more closely, HORROR! The mouth is bad. I mean the mouth is not square to the sides of the plane.
Should I try to repair it? If so, how would you recommend? Or should I try to take it back to the shop where I bought it?
Here's some pics:

Update: I took it back to the store the next day and obtained a refund. Will get a Juuma next time (Juuma is Luban is WoodRiver is ...)

As you have returned it so not a lot of point discussing further. But just in case:

It could be saved - a careful half an hour with a file might have been enough to square the mouth.
Either an angled grind on the blade, or tilting it in the holder, would have given you even protrusion, and thus a consistent shaving thickness?
