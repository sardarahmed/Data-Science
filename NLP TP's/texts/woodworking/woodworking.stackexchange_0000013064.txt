Q:

Live in Condo, not much room, want to build bathroom cabinets, what few tools can I get by with?

Like the title says, I want to get into basic woodworking to build some built-in storage cabinets for one wall in my master bath. I don't have a table saw and all that. Other than a pocket hole jig, what bare minimum tools can I get by with to make it?
I have a corded jigsaw, hand saws, a plastic Black and Decker mitre box that I just used to do some crown molding, cordless drill and impact drivers, corded power planer, corded orbital sander, corded oscillating multi tool.
I can buy a compact circular saw, and can buy a pocket hole jig.  I'm willing to do with some inconvenience regarding not having the perfect tool for each phase of the job, in favor of keeping my tool inventory light and storable in my condo.
Am I grossly missing any tools to get the job done?

A:

The circular saw is probably the most important tool if you will build with sheet goods, for safety even many makers with table saws use circular saws for the first cuts.
Essential tools list:

Circular saw
tracksaw channel or DIY cutting guide + clamps
large blocks of dense foam (to saw on)
4 bar clamp or parallel clamps
1 or 2 corner clamps
pocket hole jig or dowel jig
drill
screwdriver with set of replacement tips
set of brad-point drill bits
Forstner bit for mounting cabinet hinges
large t-square or speed square
measuring tape

Not essential but I would also like:

jigsaw
saw with hardened teeth (not Japanese style)
set of cheap chisels
block plane
1m steel ruler
large milled tooth file

I refer you to the China Tools series by Hooked on Wood on YouTube for recommendations on many of the above from BangGood including corner clamps, t-square, drill bits and pocket hole jigs .
