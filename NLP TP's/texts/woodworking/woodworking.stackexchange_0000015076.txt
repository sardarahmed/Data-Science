Q:

Why would a router bit have a spur on it?

Was just gifted what at first glance I thought was a 2" flattening bit for a 1/2" shank router.
But it has a spur and cutting rim like a forstner bit except there's no way with a shank of its proportions it could be a forstner bit. The spur is proud of the rest of the chopper and cutting rim and probably sharp enough to cut a groove.
It had a non-descript marking "CPT 44160" that google did not offer any clarity on. I'm totally at a loss for what this cutter head is for. It's gorgeously machined and despite being quite old is still super sharp.
Any help you fine folks can offer here is much appreciated.
Is this just a weirdly specific router bit designed to cut a 2" groove with a tiny v-groove in the middle? Is it not a router bit?

A:

Not a router bit… it’s used to cut cups when used in a drill press. One technical description would be ‘hinge boring bit’. (You’ll see a lot like it in the 35mm size.)
