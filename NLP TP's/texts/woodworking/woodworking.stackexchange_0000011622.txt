Q:

Are there disadvantages to quick-change drill and driver bits?

I've heard different names for the 'groove' that allows drill bits and driver bits to be used in a quick-change-type drill. For simplicity I'm referring to the thing labeled 'power groove' here.

I vastly prefer these because they're fast to change in and out.  I need some brad point bits, and I discovered that they are not really available, as a large prepackaged set, with a power groove (or whatever you want to call it.)
Why is this? Is it just a quirk of the world that no one has made such a product? (And if there is one, please do point, the largest 'set' I've seen is a mere 5 piece compared to a 29 piece.)
Or is there something about these types of bits that is a compromise such that informed woodworkers know to avoid them and so such a product is not made.

A:

These kinds of quick-change bits are very handy, but there is inevitably some slop in the fit; that is, if you place your finder on the drill tip you will probably be able  be able to rock it slightly from side to side.  This is never an issue when driving screws, as the conical shape of the screw driving into the wood prevents the screw from wandering, with the job of the driver merely to provide downward rotational force. But when drilling holes, even with a brad-point bit, it's essential that the point of the bit does not wander off-axis as this will result in an enlarged hole. In my experience these drill bits mounted to a hex shank do always wander.
To save time using conventional cylindrical bits, a drill with a keyless chuck makes it quicker to change bits quickly.
