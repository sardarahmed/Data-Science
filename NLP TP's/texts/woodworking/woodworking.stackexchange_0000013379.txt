Q:

Makita router straight guide... not straight?

I recently got a makita RP2301FC plunge router. I'm a hobbyist and this is my first router. Today I tried using it for the first time when i noticed the straight guide isn't straight. When I push it against anything straight (a wood piece, a ruler, a straight edge) it has some room to wiggle and I can see between the wood and the guide.
Is the guide broken or is it expected/fixable?
Edit:
Here's a picture of the guide: https://ibb.co/hHMGJzc

In the picture, I push the top part towards the piece of wood and the circled gap is what bothers me.

A:

Yes the fence should be completely straight.
It needs to be straight to work properly. A slight hollow is just about acceptable (although undesirable) but if it's bowed toward the bit, even a little bit, it won't work right because the router can rock a little over the 'high' spot, altering the distance between the edge of the workpiece and the bit1.
From the Comments:

I removed the plastic pieces and the metal itself is uneven

This is definitely a replacement issue then IMO. One can fix this (since aluminium is easily filed or sanded, or you could shim the gap out2) but the bottom line is you shouldn't have to because the fence casting should have an absolutely straight edge.

1 A discrepancy of 0.3mm (~1/64th") is enough to cause issues, perhaps even a little less than this.
2 Ironically slivers of aluminium drinking cans make good shim stock.
