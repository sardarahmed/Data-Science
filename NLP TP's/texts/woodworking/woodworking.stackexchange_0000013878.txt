Q:

Store timber as logs or as slabs? [Acacia sieberiana/Vachellia sieberiana]

I recently cut down 3 Acacia sieberiana (Paperbark Acacia) trees. The trunks are around 30-45cm in diameter. The wood is known for being extremely wet.
I want to use the stunning timber at a later stage.
Is it better to store them stacked in 38mm slabs or should I leave them as logs and only cut after a year??

A:

Your trees will maybe begin to decay if stored as logs. When sawmills need to store logs for extended time it is often kept floating in water. Logs can be safely stored in water for years, out of water big chance of fungus attack or drying defect and yield always lower.
If you are lucky and your logs survived 1 year storage drying clock starts after sawing slabs, so wood will not be ready to use for over 3 years!
Saw now, seal end grain very well (most important!), stack with stickers, tie together with strong strap clamps or band clamps. Your slabs ready to use in 24-28 months.
