Q:

Green wood (for turning) and mold risk

I do woodturning in a community shop (maker space) and it turns out they have a policy against (or at least highly discourage) using green wood in the shop due to the possibility of mold growth in the dust collection system and shop vacuums.
I only discovered this policy after turning a couple of bowls from a branch of maple which came down in my yard after a storm. The shop lead says I might be able to turn green wood if I use a broom rather than a shop vac to clean up the shavings. Turning these first few green bowls was fun and the branch which came down was huge so I have a lot of wood.
Is there anything I can do to assuage these concerns about mold growth (aside from letting the wood dry for a couple of years)?
I'm new to woodturning and wood shops in general so this is the first I have heard about the mold issue and my internet searches have turned up almost nothing about turning green wood and mold.

This just seems a little nuts to me.  Even the wettest wood that will spray you with moisture as you turn it isn't going to make that much difference in a large dust collection system.  and if it's heavily used (the dust collector) it really wouldn't be much of an issue, between the relatively low volume of material you are putting in there and how often it is emptied.  If it is 'reasonably' dry like you didn't cut it down yesterday and have kept it out of the rain for a week or so, it REALLY shouldn't make much difference.
Now having said that, Green turning also tend to make large easy to clean up piles of shavings and very low 'dust'.  So just letting it all hit the floor and sweeping it up later also shouldn't be a big deal, as long as they have a place for you to put them after you are done.
Honestly, if they have metal ducting, I'd be more worried about very wet turning causing rust than any mold.
