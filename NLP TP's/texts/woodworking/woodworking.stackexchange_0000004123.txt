Q:

Can I switch from my oil base finish, that still has not dried, to a water based poly?

Spar (oil base) won't dry on bar top and it has been 4 days so far. 
Can I switch to water based Poly?

Not without first removing the oil-based varnish. It's not about any chemical incompatibility, even after thorough 'drying' of an oil-based varnish it's easy to get beading of a waterbased finish applied on top.
It is possible the spar won't ever dry properly because something has gone wrong, but generally with this sort of thing patience is rewarded and the varnish will dry eventually, although in extreme cases it can take two weeks or so. 
If you can't wait for some reason your best option might be to strip the existing varnish off, clean the wood down with an appropriate solvent and then give it a light sanding once it has dried. Then start again.
With the spar still being tacky you might just be able to use mineral spirits/white spirit to dissolve it, but if it has partially cured it may require something stronger, i.e. a reputable chemical stripper.
