Q:

Is it feasible to use furring strip to create a large frame?

My first woodworking project. I've completed a large puzzle, dimensions ~ 62" x 42", and I'm interested in creating a "frameless" frame to mount it on the wall. This would involve cutting and securing long, slender cuts (preliminary dimensions 1" x 2") to a 1/4" thick piece of MDF board. The entire process can be seen here. 
The video uses pine DAR (Dressed All Round, seems to be an Aussie product) secured to a 6mm thick MDF board. The sides of the pine DAR are stained as well. However, I can't seem to find any DAR locally in the US. I've seen that furring strip is cheap and comes cut in dimensions I can easily work with. 

Is furring strip "structurally" sturdy enough for me to use in this application?
Is there a specific name for the "x brace" pattern being used here?

A:

You could use 1x2s if you can find some that are good quality or could rip some from wider boards. The 1x2 furring strips I've seen tend to be inferior quality wood, and more often than not warped, twisted, and bowed. 
I don't know of a specific name for that kind of frame construction, but wouldn't be surprised if there was one.
