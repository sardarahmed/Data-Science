Q:

Can I use a CNC router bit specified for metal on wood?

Some online shops selling CNC router bits only specify what metals the bit can be used on. Is it safe to assume that if the bit can be used to mill metals that it's safe to use all types of non-treated wood?
Specifically, I'd like to mill douglas fir, but also interested in walnut. 

A:

I can't imagine a bit capable of milling metal having any difficulty whatsoever dealing with fir or walnut. 
However I don't know you can assume that a metal-cutting bit will leave a particularly good surface on wood because of the different edge geometry (similar to twist drills, where metal-specific ones are subtly different to general-purpose or wood-specific ones). So it's probably a good idea to expect that a very light skimming cut will be needed to finish off.

A:

I agree with Graphus, however also be careful of the max. RPM of the tools, since metal-cutting tools are often designed to run more slowly than woodworking tools.
