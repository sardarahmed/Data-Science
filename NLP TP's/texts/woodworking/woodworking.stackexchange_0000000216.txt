Q:

Closing mouth on coffin plane

I have a Scioto coffin plane whose mouth is a little on the wide side. I'd like to glue a piece of wood inside the front of the throat to close it up, but I don't know if rubbing end grain against the face of my work is the best idea. Is there another way?

A:

I believe people generally use an inlay on the sole to repair or close up the mouth.
