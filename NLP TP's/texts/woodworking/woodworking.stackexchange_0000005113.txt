Q:

What can I put on a wooden dowel to have a good grip?

Thereâ€™s a wooden dowel in which I will put ties on. Something like this:

How can I add a grip to the wooden dowels so the ties would stay on firmly?

A:

My first instinct is to try plasti-dip. You can get it in brush on or spray on. I made a wooden multi-guitar stand many years ago, and it worked great to protect the guitars and keep them from slipping at all.

Rubber tubing
Ever replaced a bicycle inner tube and wonder what to do with it? Or other tire tubes or a snow tube that broke? I should think that scraps of tubing would create enough friction to stop them from sliding off. You would not need to much and small scraps can be glue or have small staples hold them in place. Some inner tubes have a coating on the inside, like functioning as a sealant, so you would need to place this inside in.
Staples might not be ideal since it risks having material get caught or tear. If it is small enough and placed on the bottom of the rung, where ties wont likely touch, this might not be an issue.
Some glue from a hot glue gun would help hold it in place easy.
Rubber in general is my suggestion. It would also be easy to experiment without causing damage to the hangar.
