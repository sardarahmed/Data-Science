Q:

Fitting rails to cast iron cabinet saw

I recently got a cabinet saw that has a cast iron bed, as most such saws do.
I want to make a sled for it which requires fitting rails to the guide slots in the bed.

One issue I see is that the guide slots are not particularly deep (they are a shallow T-slot style shown above) and they have a somewhat rough surface. If I run my fingers along the side of the slot, there is some roughness.
So, my question is whether I should be filing and scraping the slots to try to make them as smooth and straight as possible before fitting the rails, or do most people accept the slots to be a little rough and its not a problem?

It really depends on how rough it is. It's pretty normal for miter slots to have a somewhat rough surface, and it's usually not a problem at all. For example, I can feel machine marks on the inside of the slots on my saw, whereas the top has been ground to silky smoothness. Remember that the miter bar that rides in the slot will contact many of those high points all at the same time, and the fact that the surface isn't perfectly smooth can actually reduce the friction because there's less contact between the bar and slot. A rough surface is only a problem if it's so much that it causes the miter bars to wear down, or to not slide smoothly.
Put the miter gauge in place and run it back and forth a few times. Does it slide smoothly? If yes, don't worry about it and move on.
