Q:

Tension of twisted beams

if a wood beam or rafter is twisted, is there a way to un-twist it? Does clamping it down for a certain period of time straighten it?
If not, is it a good idea to bolt it down to force it straight, or will the constant tension cause issues in the future?
In my case, I am building a patio and all my rafters are twisted. Patio surface area is about 30 square maters, and the rafters have 6 meters length and are 120x50 mm thick. It's practically impossible to find rafters this long that are not twisted. The other option is to use 3 meter rafters which you can find straight, but I would prefer them to be continuous until the end.
A picture for reference, (my dimensions are different and I have another row of posts in the middle that support the rafters)

I tried bolting 2 short pieces of wood on the beam, then sliding the rafter in between. Seems to hold well, there's still a bit of twist visible but it's much better than before

A:

The most straightforward fix I can think of is to install solid blocking (same dimensions as rafters) at the top and near the bottom of the run. This will mostly force the twist out. (There might be a tiny bit of creep, but it shouldn’t be noticeable.)
Depending on your aesthetic choices, you can stagger the blocking around a line (easier to nail) or line them up exactly (requires toenailing).
Oh, and to answer your initial question: there isn’t much you can do to twisted wood to make it into something flat.
