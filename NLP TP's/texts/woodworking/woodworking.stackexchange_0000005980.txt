Q:

Wooden bread dough proofing box -- high humidity

I'm thinking about making a proofing box for bread dough. I will need high humidity, and perhaps even a heating element to keep water vaporized. I'm wondering how something like shop-grade birch plywood would fare under those conditions, with or without a finish. 
I may be able to finish the inside with polyurethane, since the food won't come into contact with it, but I don't want to wait a month to have the fumes finally cure out if I can find a better solution.
My other option is a wood frame and plexiglass body, but that won't look nearly as nice. Are there any good options for humidity resistance for an application like this? Solid oak perhaps?

A:

Solid wood would be a better choice here than plywood IMO. In addition to not having to worry about the adhesive used to bond the plywood (likely urea-formaldehyde or resorcinol glue) you'll have no concerns about the surface veneer being damaged or peeling off, ever, and you won't need to use a finish to ensure durability.

Solid oak perhaps?

Oak would probably work fine but you may want to use a close-grained wood in preference. 
Beech, maple and birch would all be good options here if you want to go with a hardwood, and a quality pieces of softwoods such as SYP and Doug fir would be suitable as well.
