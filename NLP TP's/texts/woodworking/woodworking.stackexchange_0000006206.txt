Q:

Best approach for this broken chair leg

A close friend called me for help with a busted chair leg.  I hadn't seen it, but figured I'd probably be considering a good wood glue and some dowels inserted in angled holes to reinforce the thing.
As it turns out, the leg actually cracked approx 2-3 inches from the end, right beneath the corner block that attaches it to the seat.  The end is about two inches square, and it appears to have given way right near where a large screw was inserted -- AND there's a knot just opposite the screw.  The end is more narrow than the rest of the leg.
I'm not getting the sense that glue-and-dowels is going to be the right approach.  This isn't high-end furniture.  Are there cost-effective approaches to repairing and reinforcing this (to actually bear weight) without an entire workshop at my disposal?  Thanks in advance.

Looks like there's a pretty-good chance of a nice fit on the broken surfaces - Might try gluing the parts together on the break, wait for glue to dry, then drill from end for dowel and glue that in. The fact that it's so close to the end makes that practical to consider.
