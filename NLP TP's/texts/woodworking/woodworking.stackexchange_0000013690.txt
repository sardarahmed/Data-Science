Q:

Is a mixture containing boiled linseed oil still a spontaneous-combustion hazard?

A friend gave me a sample of a common waterproofing/ moisturizing/ protectant containing equal parts boiled linseed oil, beeswax, and turpentine, which makes a paste.
Is there danger of the rags used to apply this combusting?
I would think not, since the oil doesn't seem to need to dry-- the paste/wax is usually heated with a hair dryer/ heat gun to cause it to absorb into the cloth or wood to which it's applied, and the rags simply have a paste residue, but better safe than sorry.

A:

You have more or less answered your own question at the end: "Better safe than sorry."   Treat the rags as potentially combustible.   Spontaneous combustion is not caused by drying per se, but by heat generated by oxidation of the oil, which occurs during drying, and can be sped up by so-called drying agents.   The boiled linseed oil remains subject to exothermic oxidation after combining.  If the turpentine is a mineral-oil based product, it isn't subject to spontaneous exothermic oxidation itself, but it could still act to speed up the process in the linseed oil.   If it's real turpentine, derived from distilling pine, it's also a risk.
In my shop, all rags with oil residues are considered potentially dangerous and handled appropriately (which for me means, if I think I might want to re-use the rag, hanging it so that it dries in a single layer with good circulation, so no heat build up can occur, and if not, tossing into the woodstove, where combustion is not a problem).   I know it's overkill - most of them contain mineral products only, and won't spontaneously ignite, but, as you said, better safe than sorry, and by making it a rule and habit, I reduce the risk of an overlooked truly dangerous situation slipping through.
