Q:

Mullion Brass Grommets?

I have a house that was built 1904. The mullions, etc., were secured with brass woodscrews through brass housings than are much like grommets in appearance. I do not know what they are called.
I need some, as the previous owner started several projects and promptly lost the 'grommets'.
