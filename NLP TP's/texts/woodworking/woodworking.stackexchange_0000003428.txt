What is this mystery bamboo joinery on this bamboo bike frame(s)?

A:

From the manufacturer's site (http://calfeedesign.com/products/bamboo/), it looks like the connectors between the bamboo parts (called lugs) are "Hemp fiber lugs with plant based high performance eco resin". Meaning that these are basically a man-made epoxy-like parts. So, this is a not wood joinery in the traditional sense, as there is no actual contact of wood-to-wood.
