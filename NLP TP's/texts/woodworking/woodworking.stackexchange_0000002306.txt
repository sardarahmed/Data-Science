Q:

What are good reasons to return hardwood boards selected by a lumber yard?

I am building a fence with hardwood facing.  The lumber yard (not a big box store) selected the lumber, batu decking boards, and delivered it. These are fairly expensive, 1x6 x 8' and 1x4 x 8' boards.  
I know that a certain percent of boards have issues.  In the past I have hand picked, avoiding less good boards.
What are good enough reasons that might cause me to justifiably return a board?  I am ignorant on this point and don't want to be unreasonable about it.  End split (N inches or more inches)?  Packing strap damage?  Through fractures at a crushed spot? Dull planer, so rough board?  Splits / splintering on the machined edges?
I am talking a few hundred linear feet of hardwood lumber.

A:

If the lumberyard selected and delivered it, I would feel comfortable returning for exchange any pieces that I could not use due to either straightness or cosmetic defects. Some yard workers will use their discretion to dump otherwise un-sellable boards on a delivery knowing that an average contractor over-buys and will sort through the pieces to find boards that work.
