Q:

Is it OK to use WD-40 to clean wood?

I'm comparing it to mineral spirits essentially. Are they the same on wood? Mineral spirits seems to strip off any finishing on wood, will WD-40 do the same?

A:

WD-40 is not equivalent to mineral spirits at all. Mineral spirits should normally be just naptha, where WD-40 has multiple different petroleum base oils, as well as a few other ingredients.
Their compositions can be seen in the material safety data sheets:
WD-40 MSDS
Mineral Spirits MSDS
Edit:
As Allman and Keshlam say, the short answer is it will leave a residue that will be undesirable and most likely hazardous to a new finish.
