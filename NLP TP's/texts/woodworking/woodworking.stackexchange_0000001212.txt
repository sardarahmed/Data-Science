Q:

What to look for when buying a tap and die set (for wood)

I have never used a tap and die set but I find myself in the market to purchase some for a couple project I would like to do.
What features should I be looking for, ease of use, etc.?  Anything I should avoid?
I'm looking for 3/4" to 1 1/2" size die and taps

A:

Most die and tap sets are made for metal and as such, the threads may be too fine to be supported in wood.  There are sets specifically made to cut threads in wood, such as this one sold by Garrett Wade or this one made by Beall 
If you want to use a standard machine thread, you should reinforce the threads with epoxy.  

A:

A coarser Square thread or Acme thread tap and die would be good for wood as they should be stronger and more durable than the common V threads, especially for soft materials.
