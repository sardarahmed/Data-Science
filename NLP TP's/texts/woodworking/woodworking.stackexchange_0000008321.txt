Q:

Calculating length of sides of angled box

I'm building a cabinet with 19mm plywood. The left vertical side is angled at 60 degrees. I am trying to find out the correct length I need to cut both the vertical and top boards, marked A and B in the picture. Using a 3D software tool, I have calculated that the inner sides 136(A) and 182(B).
Could someone please advice on what the correct length is for outer sides A and B? Will I set the mitre cut at 60 for all angles?  All measurements are in mm.

A:

You don't need to calculate it, you don't even need to measure it* â€” you can mark directly from the work. 
This has long been the standard way this sort of thing is done in carpentry and woodworking, from before the days of widespread numeracy, the availability of calculators, and now 3D software. Make the three-sided box (doesn't have to be glued together yet), then simply 'offer up' piece A to the open end and mark it for length. This is basically the traditional way drawer fronts were sized to their openings.
This will be accurate enough, as it always has been. If nervous about nailing the perfect size with the first cut you can saw on the waste side of the line and then trim to a perfect fit. In the past this trimming would invariably have been done by shooting with a plane, now you might sneak up on a perfect fit on the table saw or using a belt sander. 
For some wiggle room if need be piece B can be cut slightly overlength with either the mitred or square end left to overhang, whichever you prefer. Then take it apart and trim to final length by whatever method you like, or flush in place by planing or with a belt sander.

*Although this is very easily done by drawing full size or to scale and measuring from the drawing. You can draw on the 19mm plywood you're using if you have no paper to hand!
