Q:

Portable table/stand for cutting wood or boards?

I was looking for a portable table to use for cutting wooden pieces and panels. I saw one in a photo of a tool, but even after long google searches I just can't find what to call it or search for. Attached the photo below.

A:

I used a variety of search terms, but the one set with the best result is "folding clamping work table tool" which appeared to exclude a number of inappropriate responses. There are differing features from one product to the next, although the one shown does appear and can be found at Worthpoint, which appears to be a page for an eBay store.

The link I've posted is nearly worthless, but the search terms show that there are other sources, including Walmart (out of stock), Alibaba and a few other China-based operations.
You may find that the search terms provide you with a different product, better suited to your needs, or may provide for a better source for this item.
