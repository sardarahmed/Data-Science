Q:

Is there a Bagless Dry Vacuum for Shop/Garage Use?

I've got the traditional Shop-Vac that uses either a collection bag or pleated filter which clogs up in no time when dealing with dust. I'm looking for something portable while doing repair jobs around the house or in the garage. I have a couple of Dyson vacuums (carpet & hardfloor) for use inside the house and I really like how easy it is to clean those out without having to deal with a filter. I've searched the Internet for a similarly designed cyclone type vacuum for shop use but haven't had any luck. I have seen the dust collector systems with the cyclone design, but those are big and not really portable. Does anyone make a cyclone or bagless shop dry vacuum as a single unit?

A:

The cyclone folks make a version that is sized for a 5-gallon bucket. You can combine that, with a small shop vacuum, on a roll-around cart. There are dozens of examples of these carts on youtube, which will provide inspiration and maybe even plans for sale.
