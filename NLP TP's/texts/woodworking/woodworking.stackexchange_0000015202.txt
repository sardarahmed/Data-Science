Q:

What are some methods for fixing mis-aligned boards?

The back piece isn't attached yet.  I'd like it to line up with the side piece, instead of having that Ëœ3/32" difference in height.
A 43x2x3/32" piece of wood to put under it would be perfect but there's no way I can cut that with a 15" hand saw (the only saw I have).
What methods are appropriate for making those boards line up?
I've debated planing and sanding the edge of the side piece, or finding something the right size to stick under the back piece (multiple layers of paperboard cereal boxes cut to size perhaps).
For the curious: this is a result of the terrible decision to disassemble and salvage wood from three couches.  With only a few exceptions every single board is exactly 1" thick.  I measured a bunch of them and then just started eying it.  I didn't discover that the board I put behind that back piece was only 29/32" thick until the glue had already dried.

If I'm interpreting the photo correctly, hand planing is what I'd recommend if planes are available.
Planing is the way to reduce thickness, since taking off material is what a plane does. This will require more effort if you don't have any specialist planes intended for taking off lots of material (e.g. a jack plane set up traditionally) but still doable without.
Perhaps move the cap iron/chipbreaker back from the edge a little, adjust for a thicker cut, go for it. Slow down and adjust the plane back to normal settings to complete.
If you work carefully at the end you can actually do this so that there's no need to sand when you're done; however, do so if you need to even up surface finish with other boards in the project (not necessary if you're painting, paint is a great equaliser).
