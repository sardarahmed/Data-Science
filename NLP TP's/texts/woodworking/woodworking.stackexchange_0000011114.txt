Q:

table saw cuts rough on left side, clean on right

When cross-cutting softwood 2x4s, I find that the blade always cuts more cleanly on the right hand side of the blade than the left.  I am not talking about tear-out here, the cut is rough through the whole of the material.  As a result, I end up having to make the final cut with work-piece on the right.  But the saw (Evolution Rage 5s with 80 tpi blade) has a nice smooth mitre slide on the left but only a rather wobbly mitre slot on the right - I therefore have to compromise support for a clean cut.  Is it normal for a table saw to cut more cleanly on one side of the blade that the other (regardless of how the wood is supported), and if not, how do I fix this?  Thanks.

A:

The fix for my problem was to approach the blade manufacturer Saxton who promptly sent a new blade which cuts as expected.
The budget nature of the saw does not seem to have been an issue, and I think my measurements of blade orientation with respect to mitre slots were probably also a red herring.
Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this solution - this is a really helpful forum.
