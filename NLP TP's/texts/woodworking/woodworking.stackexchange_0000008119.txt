Q:

How do I get the blade-guard out of the way for a plunge cut with a Dewalt circular saw?

I am using the circular saw seen below, and I would like to make a plunge cut, and I can't figure out how to do it. The bladeguard is in the way, and although I can pull it back manually with the black lever seen at left under the XR logo, that requires one of my hands to remain occupied holding it back, which is not desirable-- I need both hands to guide the saw, personally.
How is this done? Am I missing something? It seems very odd that there isn't an obvious way to do this.

A:

Plunge cutting is not a recommended use of a circular saw. The manufacturer intends for the saw to be pushed into the work-piece. The work-piece will rotate the safety guard up into the saw, and allow the blade to travel through the work-piece. There are no published instructions for plunge cuts.
To plunge cut, the guard must be held back so that the blade can enter the work-piece. This can be accomplished by rotating the guard into the saw, and holding onto the black handle with the thumb of the right hand (the trigger hand is the left). Pull the guard back before pulling the trigger.
