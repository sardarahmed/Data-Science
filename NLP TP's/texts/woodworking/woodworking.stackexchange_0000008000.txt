Q:

What is the name of doors that open everywhere by being pushed on in only one part?

I want to design a kind of contemporary door that I've seen before where it opens by splitting down the middle, and if you push on only one half of the door, the other half still opens at the same speed. Is there a name for this kind of door?

A:

I believe you are looking for a set of connected Pivot Doors like this.
Your hinge mechanisms need to be connected so as one moves, the other matches.
