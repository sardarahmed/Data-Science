How to make a long shallow cut on a narrow piece of wood with a circular saw

I am using 5.5 inch wide cedar fence board as lapboard style siding on a chicken coop. The roof is a ~22 degrees shed style roof. I'm having trouble making the long cuts which touch the roof. The one cut I made in the picture below was much more difficult than I wanted it to be. I do not own a table saw or a sliding miter saw. I do have available a circular saw (which I used for this one cut) and a miter saw with a 10 inch blade. 
What is the best strategy for making such a long cut?

A:

You need a guide board. Figure out the distance from the edge of the circular saw blade to the edge of the plate, preferably not the side that the motor hangs over, or your board will have to be very thin to fit underneath it. Clamp the board (make sure it's a straight one!) to the work piece parallel to the cut line, at the distance you measured on your circular saw. Run the plate of the saw along the guide board as you cut, and your cut will follow your cut line exactly. I did this for a long time back before I got a table saw, and still do it when cutting large stock like plywood sheets that can't easily be cut on the table saw.

As Drew said you can use a guide board.  
However, when using a circular saw myself, I just draw the straight line I need to cut and then make sure the piece that needs to be cut is secured (often a partner holding it down but a simple clamp or two can work too).  Of course the board will be flat (like a piece of plywood sitting on saw horses) to the ground.  Cutting along the line is pretty easy, there is a mark on the front guide that shows you where the blade cuts, keep it on the line.  Just don't push the saw faster than it wants to cut.
A bonus, when you are getting short boards like that, you can get 2 pieces with one cut!  the second board just need to be cut to length square!
