Q:

rabbet cut from middle of board along length

how do I make this cut into a in the middle of the length of a board?

A:

I'd recommend cutting this using a router, if you have one. You could use a rabbeting bit with a bearing, a router table with a fence, or clamp a board on top to act as a fence for the base of the router. These would all involve carefully starting and stopping the cut in the right place and will and leave rounded ends where the rabbet starts and ends.
If the ends of the cut really need to be square, you can finish it with a chisel.
