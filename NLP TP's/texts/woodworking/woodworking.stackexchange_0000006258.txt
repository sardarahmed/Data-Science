Q:

What useful features should I look for in a router?

I'm  thinking about buy my 1st router. I would be using for general wood working. I.e cutting out slots, finishing off edges, mainly trying to learn. The question is what features, characteristics and quality should a beginner look for?
Thanks everyone. 

A:

Plunge base - Does the base have the ability to raise and lower the router with hand pressure?  This allows accurate plunge cuts for things like stopped grooves and mortises.
Power - Does the router have enough power to do bigger cuts?  For an all-purpose hand router I'd look for a minimum of 2 hp.  Less than that will limit what you can do, particularly in hardwoods.
Build Quality - How much play is there in the plunge pillars?  How well does the depth adjustment lock?  There are a number of things that can cause inaccuracy to creep into your work.
Ergonomics - How does it feel in your hands?  Is the power switch easy to reach from the handles?  Is the base large enough to be stable?
Other Features

Does it come with variety of collet diameters? (1/2", 1/4" or other common in your country)
Does it have soft-start / speed adjust / constant torque electronics?
How easy is the bit change mechanism (ratcheting is better than locking pin is better than two-wrench)?
Does it have dust collection ports?
Can it accept guide bushings?
Can it be mounted into the table ? (and how to rig depth adjustment mechanism)
