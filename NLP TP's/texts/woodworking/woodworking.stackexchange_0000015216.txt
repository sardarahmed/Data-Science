Q:

Making a thick door not catch on a drawer front

I am planning a sideboard that has 2 sets of doors on the outside and a pair of drawers in the middle. The desired appearance of the doors and fronts requires that the doors be as thick as 1.5 inches. Doors are overlay on the sides, inset on the top and bottom. I'm about to start prototyping, but I'm already thinking that the inner doors are going to strike the drawers in the center when they open, due to the thickness. Any advice on a type of hinge to use to avoid this binding, or an engineering idea to keep it from happening to begin with?

A:

Because the leading edge of a door travels in an arc instead of a straight line, in instances where the door fits tightly or a door is thicker than usual, you need to cut the leading edge of the door at a slight angle to clear the frame of the door and still allow it to close tightly.
The way to do this is with a plane (or even a table saw, if available) so that the angle of the leading edge of the door allows the door to swing in to/out of the opening as tightly as possible.

Depending on the specific dimensions of the door, the desired fit, etc. a good starting point would be somewhere like a 2-4 degree bevel on the edge of the door. You might want to practice this to find the best fit.
(I'm sure some "math guy" could provide a way to find the exact angle with an equation or calculation, but I am not that guy....)
