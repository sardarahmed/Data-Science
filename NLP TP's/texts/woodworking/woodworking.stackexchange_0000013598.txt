Q:

Edge Joining: How flat is flat enough?

I'm trying to edge joint boards without a jointer or a table saw....
I have a small router table with an 18" fence (Only 9" outfeed fence) which I tried to use with some jointing shims. I ran two boards through and the resulting edge was fairly flat but if I hold them up to a light I can see some gaps.
How flat is flat enough to edge join boards?
I assume that it might be a slightly different answer for each of the following.

Plain Butt
Tongue and Groove
Doweled
Spline

Are there any numerical/measurement based specifications?

A:

You don't say how big gaps are but if they are small edges are already very close to straight so it is easy to improve them by planing.

Hold 2 boards together edge to edge to find high areas, mark them with pencil. Or chalk flat surface and rub board edges on it, chalk will mark high areas for you.

Plane off pencil or chalk.

Have plane adjusted for fine cut and check progress often, maybe after every shaving. 3 shavings too much!

Jointing by hand is easier with larger planes because of effect of long sole bridging gaps, but you can do it with your block plane. Work carefully to plane only marked areas.

How flat is flat enough to edge join boards?

No visible gap is usual.
With plain glued joint small gap in center only is acceptable, sometimes used deliberately. Uneven gaps and gap at ends of boards never acceptable.
2, 3, and 4 always made straight.

Are there any numerical/measurement based specifications?

|Some say yes, some say no. There is not a single number, it must be small enough that it can be closed by hand.

on short boards it must be very small.
Can be bigger on long boards, maximum approx 1/32" (0,8mm). This is total gap, so curvature on each edge 1/64" (0,4mm) or less.
Gap must be smaller on thicker boards because wood is stronger.
