Q:

Beveled edges on melamine MDF

I'd like to make some nice looking speaker boxes. The only material I have access to is melamine MDF. I don't have a table saw, so I get it cut at the store.
I want to bevel the edges so the corners will be at 45 degres (internal, so I can glue them) (I'll also have bracing inside so the corner glue won't be all of the support).
What would be the best way to get 45 degree corners? I have a circular saw and a router. The problem with the circular saw is that I don't have tracks for it so I'll need to be creative (also of course finding the exact 45 deg position).
The problem with the router is that 45 deg bits with 1" depth of cut (for 3/4" MDF) are rare and expensive. Or at least I haven't been able to find them
Also, I don't know if a beveling bit will chip the melamin. There are specific saws for circular saws to cut melamin MDF, so I suppose they will leave a clean cut.

A:

I'd use the circular saw. A track is nice to have, but not necessary. You can get a similar effect by clamping a guide to the work piece, and sliding the saw along that. The guide can be anything long and straight with a smooth edge.
