Q:

Is an in-feed extension for a table saw useful?

I'm designing a table saw extension for my DeWalt DW745. I've searched for plans and most of them add an out-feed extension to the table saw.
I'd like to cut some dadoes and rabbets in wide boards (>40cm), but set at 2cm high (just a random small height), my table saw only has about 17cm of clearance between the blade and the beginning of the table, so it gets kind of clumsy.
Also, I'd like to use a crosscut sled with said wide boards, but I'm not sure something so big would work without an in-feed extension. 
I'm aware that adding in-feed extension would make it difficult for me to access the controls of the machine.
So, would just adding a side extension help me with these problems? Why is it so uncommon to have in-feed extension, at least I haven't seen a single plan which uses it.

A:

Although this isn't quite what you asked about it does provide additional support on the in-feed side which is the heart of what you're seeking so perhaps it will do what you want:

This is an old tip supplied by a reader or contributor to Fine Woodworking that I came across while reading last night and I immediately thought of this Question. Taunton have gotten great mileage out of it having published it at least four times so I presume they think it's good! 
The original tip is available as a free PDF download, Tablesaw fence extension supports a full sheet of plywood.
Safety note
Just to emphasise something in case it's needed, you must build and mount anything like this accurately to ensure it's safe to use. If it's out of parallel with the blade it could lead to binding which is hazardous, at the very least risking damage to the workpiece and at worst serious injury to the operator.
