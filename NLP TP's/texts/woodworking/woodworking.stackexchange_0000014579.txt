Q:

Using tape to thicken shank of the endmill/rotary bit/drill

My router has a 1/2" collet to take 1/2" shank bits. I also have this generic CNC endmill whose shank is 3/8". I want to be able to use this endmill with the router.
Can I apply painter's tape (or masking tape) to thicken the shank of this 3/8" CNC endmill so I can fit it on the 1/2" collet? Would it ruin the collet?
How about in general? Can I use tape to buff up smaller bit to the larger collets/chucks of these power tools?
I know, I should probably be experimenting on this on my own. I never found the time.

A:

That sounds like a good way to get yourself seriously hurt.  There is no way Tape can handle the forces generated nor the heat from spinning at 32000 rpm.  There is a reason they are steel shanks.  The tape might melt or start on fire, and there is no way you can make it tight enough for the bit not to wobble like a top if you tried to cut anything with it, right before it shoots out and smashes something.
Your best bet would be to see if there is a 3/8" collet available for your router. Or to buy a similar bit with the correct shank size.
