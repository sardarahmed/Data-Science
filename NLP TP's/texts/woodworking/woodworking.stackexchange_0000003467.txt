Q:

What kind of wood should be used in constructing a catapult arm?

I used 2x4's on my catapult. But I'd like to make it beefier with more throwing power. The body is pressure treated wood, and eventually I'd like to add more garage springs or other counter force measures. But I need a better arm.

A:

I assume your question is not so much size (you mention 2x4, but not what type you are using).
Try ash or hickory for their spring and flexibility.  Either should give you some extra kick beyond what you get with your counterweights or springs.  @Graphus points out that it "Might be worth specifying hickory sapwood here, as the heartwood is much less springy. This is why it's specifically avoided in quality axe, pick and sledge handles â€” they should be uniformly pale, no reddish heartwood."
Clear, straight grain is a must no matter what wood you use.
