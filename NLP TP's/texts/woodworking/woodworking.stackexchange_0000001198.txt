Q:

Is this a specific kind of hand drill?

I have been collecting tools from my grandfather's old workshop. One of the items appears to be a hand drill. What is odd about this is that if you look up hand drill they either function similar to a manual egg beater or a brace-and-bit hand-drill. Closest I found was the icon for hand drills on eBay. 
This would operate with one hand which is superior to the aforementioned hand drills but for pure drilling I would think the others perform more efficiently. What is this really for and could I use this in modern wood-working?

Update
After reading some of the responses and comments I looked back at the tool with more information. I noticed the top unscrews and it contained 3 small "pins". 
The picture is enlarged. The objects are about 1 inch long. 

The jaws are perfectly sized for for these pins. It appears I had guessed, wrong potentially, that this was a drill.

That's a push drill, sometimes referred to as a "Yankee drill". It has the advantage of working in some places where you can't fit a crank or brace-and-bit.

A:

This is a push drill as @keshlam said. They're particularly useful for drilling small diameter holes quickly, easily and accurately.
It can be a bit tricky to drill a small hole steadily while you're holding a big heavy electric drill, or wobbling around with an "egg beater" style hand drill, which is where push drills come in. You can also use them one-handed which can be useful for when you need to hold something still while drilling (or for example hold multiple pieces in position for drilling through them all simultaneously).

Here is a link to some great 50's footage at the Fender guitar factory of one in use. It's only a few seconds but I think it shows its usefulness in a production situation. I suppose rechargeable battery powered drills have replaced it.Yankee drill at Fender factory late 50's
