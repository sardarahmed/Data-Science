Q:

How to restore the form of a cedar strip canoe after taking it off the mold?

I started building a cedar strip canoe and things were going swimmingly with good progress. I built the hull, fibreglass/epoxied the outside and took the hull off of the mold. Then... life happened. I had to move four times, got flooded out of one house, became a parent, etc., etc. The project inadvertently stalled for four years.
Picking it up again, I'm getting ready to glass the inside of the hull and install the gunwales and trim. But, I'm finding that the sides of the hull have curled slightly inwards making the boat narrower than its design.
What is a safe way to open it back up again without risk of cracking the hull? Should I steam it for a few hours and slowly bend it back so that the station molds again fit? Install temporary braces that can be slowly expanded? Other options?

Sounds like your cedar strips dried out some over the years, and the wood shrank more on the inside than outside because the epoxy and fiberglass prevented movement on the outside. Heating the wood with steam will make it more amenable to bending back into place, and if you can put it back on the form or otherwise brace it so that it keeps its shape, that might work. But because of the heat involved, steaming can also dry wood out, so it might exacerbate the problem.
If the sides haven't curled too much (you did say "slightly"), it might be better to just accept it as it is. Canoes have varying degrees of inward curvature, or "tumblehome", so you could just glass the inside, fit the gunwales, and declare victory.
