Q:

Three 1cm x 2cm metal sheets in my table saw packaging

There are three 1cm x 2cm metal sheets in my DeWalt DW745 table saw packaging; Does anyone know what is that for?

A:

According to the manual, they are number 6 items, extra guard shims. This implies that one can adjust the spacing of the blade guard when attaching the guard to the table. Did you get a manual with the saw?
