Q:

How might I fix wobble in my studio desk build?

This is my first major woodworking projects and I'm having a bit of trouble. I have built this custom music studio desk and it keeps wobbling side to side. 
It does have a lot of weight on it so it needs to solid. The 'open legs' are 19 inches apart and made from 3/4" inch plywood and the table top is 2 inch thick White Pine as well as the shelves that hold the speakers. There are 6 2x4 beam supports between each leg keeping the 2 sheets of plywood together at 19 inches apart and L brackets on the top and bottom connecting the beam and plywood side together on all sides. The table top is screwed in from the bottom up and that's it. 
I chose this design and how to screw it in based off the necessity of needing the space between the legs to be open to host the rackmount equipment. I am pretty limited on what I can do because I need the space to be open as much as possible. 
Here is a picture of the desk so far.  
Any suggestions will help!
Thanks!   

A:

Moving from side-to-side like this is called "racking".  It involves the piece going out of square.  Essentially the joints you have between the top and the legs do not provide sufficient support against the pieces pivoting relative to each other.
Typically you'd prevent this by having some sort of diagonal bracing.  This could be just a small bracket, or it could be a brace (or even wires) going from corner to corner.  Two typical things that prevent this without being obvious "braces" are aprons and full backs on cabinets.  
Given this design I would personally probably add a plywood back to the cabinet on the left with some openings for cabling and some kind of diagonal brace or bracket attaching the right side to the top.
