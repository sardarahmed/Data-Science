Q:

Profile straight edge to a skew wall

I've made a small frame with a 'front door' to cover an electrical fuse box.  I went to great pains to get the frame flat and square. 
However when I came to fix it to the (plastered/stucco) wall it turns out the wall of far from flat. 
I'd welcome some suggestions on how to try to adapt my frame to fit the wall profile better   (Other than a load of silicone filler)

A:

What you're looking to do is called scribing to fit and it's a standard part of most fitting of wooden elements to uneven walls. 
At minimum it can be used to get the edge to mate neatly against a wall that's a little out of plumb, next level above that would a surface that's slightly wavy and at the extreme end a very irregular or bumpy surface like a brick wall. In each case the basic marking-out technique can be very simple and straightforward, it's just the amount of work needed, and possibly the tools required, to remove the excess wood that changes.
Here are a few of the common ways to scribe an edge:

For removing the excess wood the tools needed change depending on how much and what type of shaping is required. At the simplest end just a hand plane will do (or a saw), for wavy edges a spokeshave, rasps and/or files, and for extremely irregular edges it's now common to use a jigsaw. 
The basic scribing process is simple but the details of applying it to various situations can take a bit to get your head around so it's best to read through a few detailed guides so you're clear on what's involved:
