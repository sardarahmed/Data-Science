Q:

What is the best way to install full extension drawer slides in a cabinet?

I have built a large cabinet with some two columns of drawers. I am using 28" full-extension, 100 pound, side mount drawer slides. I want both columns to have the same spacing on the drawers. The cabinet does not have a face frame.
Kreg used to sell a jig for this purpose, but it has been discontinued.

A:

If you can't buy the jig; make it!
Take a scrap of wood cut it to length and add a hook, then rip it in half.
This means that you can clamp it on the drawer to serve as a spacer for one end of the slides and between the slides on the cabinet side.

The reason for ripping the scrap in half is to get 2 blocks with for all intents and purposes the same geometry without needing to be very precise twice.

A:

I use a spacer which is basically just a piece of scrap wood cut to width to make sure they are all the same. And with no face frame I would just add false fronts to the drawers to cover the slides and is also easier then to ensure your gap around them is even. I think I learned of this trick in Fine Woodworking's website, if I find it I will post a link.
