Q:

My jigsaw is terrible at cutting vertically through a simple 2x4

I made some Canexican saw horses for a friend. I liked the design feature that made it so the 2x4 sat in a perfect recess and could be changed out easily. 

I was cutting the angles with the jigsaw, using a 3 inch blade, and every cut I made was not straight. I measured some of the angles at 10 degrees which is awful. 
If I just run my jigsaw in the air I can see the blade at the end move about 2 cms. I would have expected that to be normal since nothing is support it out that far. Not sure if that is a factor. The blade I was using was not a fine tooth (8 teeth per inch) so there should have been enough space for dust to get out. I really don't think that is the issue since the problem starts at the initial cut as supposed to starting straight and getting progressively worse. Speed didn't seem to matter. I started slow and fast (to attempt to prove a point) and the results were the same. 
My jigsaw is a cheap Jobmate one that has served me well for sheet goods but I just cant use it for this reliably. 
What I am doing wrong or it is possible my tool or blade are at fault here?

A:

Really, jigsaws are not the best tool for this job. They are far better at cutting through thinner board materials, though even then you may struggle to get a fully straight cut.
As you say, nothing supports the blade at the end so it can easily wander off of its intended course.
A more expensive jigsaw may have better rollers/support for the blade though so that might help, but if you're going to be buying a new tool for this kind of job then I'd probably recommend a skillsaw or a chopsaw / mitresaw.
