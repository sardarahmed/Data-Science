Q:

How do I clean aluminum tool tables?

Now that I've got the rust on my table saw taken care of, I realized that my 25 year old miter saw base could use a little love.

The majority of the saw is made out of cast(?) aluminum, so it hasn't "rusted", but it does have an uneven coating of oxidation on it, and it's got some fairly noticeable machining marks on it (from new), with the darkest of the oxidation seeming to be in the deeper grooves from the machining.
While I used naval jelly to clean the cast iron table saw, I don't believe that's appropriate for cleaning aluminum. (And, I don't want to chance it taking the lettering off the miter gauge, etc.)
I gave it a quick pass with the RO sander with 220 grit paper (straight off of duty cleaning up the table saw), but that didn't seem to help much. I don't want to sand it too much, as I believe the aluminum would be much softer than the iron, and I can see where it would be much easier to end up with an uneven surface if I'm not careful.
What chemical or mechanical methods would be appropriate for cleaning oxidized aluminum surfaces while providing minimum risk for damage?
Of course, I realize the answer may just be "leave it the heck alone and use it more", but after seeing how (relatively) easy it was to spiff up the table saw, I'm motivated to get this looking shiny and new again.

A:

Maybe try automotive/marine aluminum polish like used on aluminum wheels and so forth.
Or, maybe something like this Aluminum Cleaner/Brightener/Restorer which seems to be a non-abrasive approach.
Caveat: I have no first-hand experience using these products on miter saw tables (I'm good with it as it is) but have used the polishing compound on wheels over the years and they do a good job.
