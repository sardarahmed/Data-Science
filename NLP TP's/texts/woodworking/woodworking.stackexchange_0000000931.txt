Q:

How do you reliably set all your jointer knives to the same, correct height?

I have an older delta model jointer, and I always struggle to get all three knives consistently set at the same height. 
I've tried a large magnetic jig that purports to help, but.. it really doesn't- it gets in the way of tightening down the nuts that hold the knife in place, so the knife tends to move when you slide the magnet out of place (or you bump it with the wrench and have to start over.)
I've also tried the distance per rotation thing with a piece of tape and a straight edge, but it becomes hard to keep the front and back side of the blade at the same height that way (they tend to rock in the middle.)
Anyone have tips or a jig to help keep your planer knives lined up?

A:

This article has a nice tutorial about how to set the jointer knives.
It covers 2 styles of heads.
First is the style with jackscrews (labeled A in the image):

With those you can adjust each screw until the blade is set correctly (as with the straightedge method).
The second style is the one with pushback springs.

With those there should also be a jig you hold against the head that holds the knives at the right height and provides enough space for you to tighten the screws.
