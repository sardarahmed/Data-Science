Q:

How to fix wood pieces on corks

I would like to fix self-made wooden pieces on top of the following reusable corks:

Their description can be found here (where I bought them and where the picture comes from).
The pieces to fix can be of any shape: spheres, cubes, cones, cylindres, polyhedrons, etc... are painted and may come from different types of wood. They are decorative, and are not bigger than twice the size of the cork.
Should I simply use a wood glue?
With this method, it seems a bit difficult to solidly fix a sphere without putting a lot of glue.
Are there alternative ways?
Ideally, the method should be aesthetic and solid enough to resists a bottle opening. 

A:

I would suggest drilling a hole into the wooden part of the bottle top and a corresponding hole on the bottom of your decoration. That way, you'll be able to dowel the two pieces together. 
This can leave the appearance of the both parts unaffected, and the dowel and the inside of the hole will be good surfaces for the glue to bond to. Also, you are not relying on the surface area in the same way; you can easily glue a spherical object to the flat surface in this way.
