Q:

Gluing boards from big-box stores

An answer to a previous question of mine suggested gluing two boards bark-side to bark-side in order to compensate for possible cupping. I'll likely be buying the boards at a big-box store (Lowes) and am wondering if the boards are really suitable for gluing as purchased? Are the edges flat and true and square enough, or should I do some cutting beforehand? I have a table saw and router (with table), and have seen some interesting jigs on youtube to square up faces and such, but would prefer to avoid the extra work if I can.

A:

Nothing straight from the store will ever be as flat as you can make it, just because wood is always moving a bit. However, S4S boards will have been jointed/planed flat before they reached the store, so at one time they were dead flat and might still be flat enough for laminating.
