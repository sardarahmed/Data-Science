Q:

Drilling through 3/4" MDF?

I want to drill 48 dog holes through 3/4" MDF.
I tried Forstner and spade bits. The Forstner did fine but heated up and became dull. The spade bit left a jagged edge on hole top.
What bit would be the best for this application?

A:

Drill a pilot hole for your Forstner bits before drilling the main hole.
The problem here is that MDF isn't nearly as compressible as wood.  If you look at the center of a Forstner bit you'll see that the center spur doesn't actually cut.  Material isn't mechanically moved away from the center, it's just compressed to the side and later cleared by the cutting edges.  This works fine in softwood, plywood, and even hardwoods, but MDF simply doesn't compress.  This prevents the bit from moving down and engaging the material fast enough.
If you drill a pilot hole slightly smaller than the center spur on the Forstner bit it will allow the face cutting edges to engage properly and it should cut through the MDF like butter.
