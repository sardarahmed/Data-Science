Q:

Help me design a support structure

In short...I need to build a exterior wooden support structure that can hold a sand filled box 3'tall x 4' wide x 13" deep...weighing roughly 1400lbs.
The support structure needs to be at least 1 foot wider & longer and stand approximately 3 feet tall. Making the entire combined height 6 feet tall. I'm not sure what dimensions wood to use to support that weight nor how to design it.
This supporting structure will be sitting on the ground. I want it to be "temporary". As I do not want a permanent concrete pad for ground support. I do realize the problem with that idea. If there is a way to get around making a permanent base, that would be ideal.
I thought about using railroad ties and as a ground level base to help with elemental degradation, but have no easy way to cut something that thick.
Any ideas will be so much appreciated!

A:

I would frame this with 4x4 corner columns extending up the full 6' height. I would frame the elevated floor with 2x6 joists at 16" oc. max.  The deck can be 3/4" plywood.  In essence your are building a very small house frame. You can make the 13" sides with the remains of the plywood and secure the panels at a the top to a 2x4 top plate and studs at 16" oc. To keep it from racking use "X" diagonal 1x3 cross braces secured to the 4x4s from floor level to grade.  Since it is temporary, you can rest the columns on a couple concrete block slabs 2"+/- thick.  I also recommend having a means of draining the plywood floor and using a plastic sheet to keep any wet sand from directly contacting the wood assembly.
