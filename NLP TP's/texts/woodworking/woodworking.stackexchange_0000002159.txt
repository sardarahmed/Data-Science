Q:

How can I debark wood?

I'm up at the cottage and I wanted to make myself a traditional bow saw. I got this green  piece of poplar and I need to debark it before I rip it. It's about 4-5 inches in diameter if that matters. 

What tools can I use to remove the bark? It is not peeling by hand and my pocket knife would be tedious. 

A:

A draw knife is one traditional tool used to remove bark. 
If you have a folding pocket knife, you might be able to hack it into a mini-draw-knife- wedge the tip into a small stick, use tape or twine to close up the split, then use the body of the knife as one handle, and the stick as the other.

A:

As @TXTurner suggests, a drawknife is great for bark removal.  The dirt, grit, and grime in the bark will dull the blade faster, so it might be a good idea to have a drawknife dedicated for the task.
National Trails Training Partnership also suggests the following tools:

I also suggest using a hatchet or small axe for bark removal.  I've done this plenty of times with good results.  Using a broad axe or a side axe will help speed things up since they're made for this sort of thing.  Side axes only have a bevel on one side thus they are much less likely (or entirely unlikely, if properly sharpened) to bounce off the log and into your leg.
