Q:

What are #1, #3, #324 Wood Pegs

I'm planning on making a rocking tractor from the Cherry Tree plans , which call for #1, #3, #57, and #324 wood pegs. Does anybody know what these are exactly? The wood toy parts supplier web pages I've looked at don't use numerical notations like this for pegs. 
Yes, I know I could make a guess from looking at the plans and pictures, or I could just order the parts kit that Cherry Tree sells, but I'm curious where these numbers are coming from, so if anybody could clue me in, I'd really appreciate it!

A:

They are part numbers from Cherry Tree.  When you go to their search page notice that each item has a part number showing in plain black text.  Most of the numbers look kind of like they come from a master list of catalog parts, but some are real simple like 1, 3 or 324.
I did a search for "peg" and found part 1, a "multi use peg" on page 9; part 3, "wood axle peg" on page 15; 324 "wooden axle peg" on page 17.  I did not look for part 57 and will leave that up to you to find.
