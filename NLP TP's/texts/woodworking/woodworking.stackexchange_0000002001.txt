Q:

What factors are considered when grading softwood

If I just want some cheap material for a project, I often consider using softwood (meant for framing and construction uses) dimensional lumber. In case I pass by a Home Depot store and I have to pick up some scraps by the side of the road, what grade are those scraps? What kind of grades of lumber do contractors usually throw away?
Do they generally stock No. 2 or No. 3 grade lumber? Do they even carry No. 1? Is a stud always a No. 2?
Without relying on the lumber to be graded and labeled correctly, what factors can I look for to estimate the grade myself? Is it absence of knots, or just general appearance?

A:

In general, lumber grade refers to how free the wood is from knots and similar defects. Exact definitions vary depending on the kind of wood. 
The exact details for hardwood grades are a complicated mix of how many and how large "clear" (knot-free) or solid (no loose knots, no cracks) pieces one can get out of the board, and whether you want that clear grain on both sides or are willing to settle for just one being pretty. The grading is generally done by eye.
For softwood the system is based on structural strength rather than appearance, and the grading is supposed to be more rigorous since, literally, more rests on the accuracy of the tests. 
To get uncommon grades -- weaker softwood or knottier/"rustic" hardwood -- you may need to hit real lumberyards or sawmills rather than hitting a big-box store. Whether the price difference justifies the effort will depend on your needs and local availability.
Note that the traditional solution for ugly wood was to paint it
