Q:

Strength of oak versus maple

I am planning to build a heavy duty work bench from a custom end grain butcher block table. The maker offers five different woods: maple, oak, cherry, walnut, and industrial maple.
I know that oak is stronger than maple, but will it make a difference? How much stronger is it?
Note that this table will be used for metal working (heavy hammering) and supporting heavy, cast iron machine tools, like arbor presses, so it's got to be very strong and rigid.
Also, what about walnut, its a lot more expensive. Would it have any advantages? Harder than maple maybe?

A:

Strength should not be your concern.
A butcher-block slab with a large unsupported span is likely to to fail - the vertically-oriented wood fibers will separate (which happens normally with moisture changes and is called checking) under any load.
Your slab must be supported by an underlying structure which will prevent any flexing loads from being applied.
Hardness is measured (for wood) on the Janka scale, and you can find a comparison chart here
TL:DR - Go with maple.
