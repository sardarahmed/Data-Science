Q:

Drop beam span beyond post

I have an existing deck with sistered 2x12 drop beams and joists cantilevered over top.  The 2x12 current extend ~12" beyond the 'outside' post.  The span is significantly less than 12'.
We are considering extending the deck ~2'.  This would yield a beam that extends ~3' beyond the outermost post.  
Lots of information exists specifying the extension of joints beyond the beam, but I am not seeing anything describing beam extension beyond a post.
Does anyone have experience with this or a specification?  Before doing anything I want to know if I'll be digging another footer...

A:

Considering that it appears that a Douglas Fir 2" x 12" can span a 17' section being braced on both ends and 24" apart, you shouldn't have any problem with 1/4 of that hanging unsupported.  However, making a brace that supports part of the overhang with a 6"x 6" at 45 degrees could significantly improve the support.  so the cross beam might reach 2' out along the 4' overhang.  The span tables in the pdf below can help.  
Many places actually need a deck plan approved and inspected after it is done to make sure it meets code.  At the very least they can be consulted beforehand to prevent any major issues.
