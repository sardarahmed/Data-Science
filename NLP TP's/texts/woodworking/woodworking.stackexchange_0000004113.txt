Q:

Raised platform around bed with built-in storage

I have a small bedroom where I want to build something similar to this project.

As a start point I want to take this bed and build around it.

I tried to found some tutorials (or just articles) which describe similar projects to avoid common pitfalls, but found nothing.
So, I'm looking for any links to tutorials, articles which describe similar ideas.
Any piece of advice also appreciated.

A:

I think your searching around for similar projects to help as a starting point for this was just hampered by your wording, as this type of storage is not shelving. So projects with "shelves" or "shelving" as keywords won't match what you're looking for, which I think is most commonly referred to as a platform bed. The storage built into the platform is secondary, and in-floor storage may be what to look for for that aspect of it.
So separate searches for "platform bed" and "in-floor storage" may yield what you need, you could then combine features and build details.
As you might expect something along these lines has already been done by a few people (not least by the person who built the original that you're looking to copy of course) so there's a decent amount out there to find. Here's a link from Apartment Therapy that will at least give you a starting point, 6 Ways to Make Your Own Platform Bed with Ikea products.
If you want to look for a bit more you may have some luck on Ikea Hackers, a search for "bed platform" yields 192 results and one or more is sure to be of some help.
