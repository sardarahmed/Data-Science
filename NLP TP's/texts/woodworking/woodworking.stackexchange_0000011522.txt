Q:

Laminating a long beam for strength

Very similar to this question I want to create a balance beam to span the narrow part of a swimming pool which is 16'. I'm thinking of a length of 18' to allow 1' on either side. My initial thoughts around this beam are to laminate together 3 sets of 6-foot 2x4s in this pattern:

Some questions about this:

Is there a way to roughly-measure/estimate/guess how much weight this could  bear in the middle?
Will this even work or is there a better way to do this?
It's going to get plenty of water splashed on it when used. Any considerations with respect to that?
If I'm able to find longer 2x4s that are straight enough would 9' lengths in the same pattern work better?

A:

I just looked at my building code span tables for Glue-Laminated beams (I work at a Architectural/Structural Engineering Firm in  Ontario, Canada) and The best options for a 16' beam spanning 14' is 2 - 2x10s which can support 198lbs per linear foot or 3 - 2x10s which can support 298lbs. There is no number on 3 - 2x8s but 2 - 2x8s will only support 84lbs per linear foot at a 14' span.
These numbers represent a deflection of 1/360 of the length so over 14' that would be only 0.46"
Personally I would not use 2x4s. If you don't care to much about deflection you could likely get away with 3 - 2x6s but expect a deflection of 1-2"
