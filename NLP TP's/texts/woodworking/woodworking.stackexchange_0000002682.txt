Installing fancy distressed wall hanger knobs

So the other day, I found a wonderful set of large knob-shaped wall hangers from Sheffield home at T.J Maxx, so I bought them all. But when I got home, I realized that there was no hardware included with the knobs and no directions on how to install the hangers. Does anyone out there know how these particular knobs should be installed and the hardware to use?

Update #1
So, I installed using the screw as prescribed by several of the contributors here. Using a ballaster screw, I was able to get the screw into the keyhole but noticed the knob was not quite as tight as I would have liked. So I attempted to push the screw further in and that resulted in a disaster. The Knobhead shattered, leaving me to discover that it, in fact, had a width of about 0.03 inch to work with. One of the thoughts I had was to fill the whole with wood filling. An example of what I started is in the lowest pics.

By to look of the "keyhole" shaped holes in the back of the knobs, you're probably supposed to slide them onto the head of a screw that's attached to the wall.
Here's the keyhole in glorious ASCIIart, with labels, to make this easier to explain:
      +--+
      |  |    <------ thin end
      |  |
    _-'  '-_
   /        \
  |          |  <---- circle end
   \        /
    '--__--'

So you do this:

find a screw the head of which is a little smaller than the circle end
screw that screw into the wall where you want the knob, but not all the way

Like this:
     Side view

/ / / /|      head of screw
WALL / | gap ##
/ / / /|     ###
################ <-- shaft of screw
################
 / / / |     ###
/ / / /|     ##

Then:

push the knob against the wall, with the screw head lined up so that it goes into the circle end
slide the knob down, so the shaft of the screw is in the thin end and the head of the screw is inside the knob

Like this:
    On insertion           After moving knob downward
      +--+                         
      |  |                           
      |  |                           
    _-'  '-_                          +--+    __ these side parts hold the
   / ###### \                        #|##|#  /   knob against the wall.
  | ######## <---- screw head ----> ##|##|##
   \ ###### /                       _#'##'#_
    '--__--'                       /        \
                                  |          |
                                   \        /
                                    '--__--' 

If you can't move the knob down, you need to make the gap larger by unscrewing the screw.  If the knob is too loose, you need to make the gap smaller by screwing the screw in a bit further.
Good luck!

For solid knobs just a wood screw in the back is all that's needed.
It doesn't need to be centered exactly just however much your OCD requires of you.
Getting it centered will be easier by drilling in a pilot hole first. This will also prevent the knob from cracking.
For your type you should try and find screws with a small enough head to fit in the circle of the keyhole like opening and a shaft able to fit in the little slot. That will be what will take the strain.
The second hole is for a pin/nail to avoid the knob rotating and slipping off the screw.
