Q:

Best method to attach an edge board to an end-table top board

I'm making a end-table topper out of 1 3/8" butcher block for over the top of a subwoofer.  I posted a question about how to route out the center of a board.  It was determined that although it is possible to route out the interior of the massive board, attaching an edge board would be the path of least resistance to create the end table top.     
Given the scope of my prior question, I decided to open a new one.
Which is the standard practice of attaching the edge board?  Which might be the most cohesive with butcher block?  Would glue or nails or both be better?  If nails and/or glue, what kinds?
 

A:

I would create an apron frame attached to the bottom of the butcher block. This way you can maintain the solid butcher block look, and it will greatly simplify the construction.
Offsetting the apron frame prevents the difficulty of having to line up with the top, as well as opening up the possibility of using a different material altogether. 
If you are able to, mitering the corners will provide the best look overall. From here you could simply glue and nail these pieces to the top.
