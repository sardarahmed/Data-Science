Q:

Polyurethane a box (vertical sides)

I was originally going to use spray lacquer for my speaker cabinets which are essentially large cubes.  However, I've switched to brush on Poly.  Is it possible for me to apply the poly on the vertical surfaces?  If not, when will the poly be dry enough for me to turn the box so the poly surface will be vertical.  
Example: Perhaps 1 side wait 30 minutes, turn and do another side?  At some point with that method, I'll need to rest the box on a poly'd side, how long would that side need to cure before resting the box on it's side while the newly poly'd side dries?

Yes, that shouldn't be a problem as long as the finish is thin enough. You can use various thinners with polyurethane, such as mineral spirits. But you shouldn't need to worry about that if you use a product that's meant for wiping or brushing.

when will the poly be dry enough

Drying time will depend on the particular product, the temperature, whether you've added any thinner, and maybe other factors too. As an example, I've got a can of Watco wipe-on poly that says the product will be dry to the touch after two hours.
