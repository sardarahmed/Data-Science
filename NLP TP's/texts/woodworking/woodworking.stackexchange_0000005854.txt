Q:

Why does an impact driver have some 'wobble'?

I noticed how any impact I use has a little 'wobble' in the bit. Really noticeable in a long Philips or a spade bit. I own a Ryobi, but I have used Rigid, Bosch, and Dewalt. Every one with the same thing. Is this meant to be? Will it cause problems when driving screws into my projects?

A:

I'm going to address the "what advantage would there be over a regular drill" part of the question first.
Impact drivers are much better at driving fasteners, drills are much better at drilling.  (Hence the different names...)
When you're drilling you want a thin, continuous cut.  This means that you normally don't need a ton of torque, but you want it continuously.  Drills are built to do this because they just turn at full torque the whole time.
With a fastener you don't really care if you stop and start, but you want as much torque as possible.  So an impact driver applies more torque, but it does it intermittently (hence the "clicking" when you use it.)  This also has the added benefit of not causing "reaction" torque, when a drill binds up and tries to twist your arm.  So you can apply a lot more torque with an impact than you ever could with a drill.
All that said, since an impact is intended to be used with fasteners it doesn't really matter if it wobbles.  You're normally using it on something that isn't prone to walking around like a twist drill bit does.
