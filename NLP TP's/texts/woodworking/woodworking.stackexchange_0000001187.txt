Q:

How is a "paintbrushed" distressed texture created?

Today at a bar we sat at a table that looked like this:

Some of the darkened areas looked like darkening related to the wood grain while others resembled brush strokes, but only if you looked closely.
I am wondering how one might be able to create a look like this

A:

I did a similar look for a neighbor.  Basically you apply a finish (or use reclaimed wood).  After it dries, add another layer.  Repeat until you have a few layers.  Then sand it off.  Sand deeper on some parts, lighter on others.
If you want, apply a clear coat after you have achieved the look you want to protect it.
