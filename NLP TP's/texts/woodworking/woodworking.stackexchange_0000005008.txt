Q:

Orbital sander papers coming off

I'm own a Black&Decker orbital sander (can be found here, using hook and loop papers), which is generally a good tool except for the fact that the sanding papers fall off before their sand becomes unusable.
I tried using different paper brands, but same result - paper usually comes off way before it becomes not-sandy. Anything I'm missing? Or do I need a better sander/papers?

A:

It sounds like you need to replace the pad on your sander.  This is the "hook" part of the hook and loop system.  This is a typical point of failure for orbital sanders, so it should be fairly easy to find one.
If you find you are going through them frequently (in addition to the steps in Rob's answer) you should consider using a "pad protector".  This is just a two-sided sheet with "hooks" on one side and "loops" on the other.  They are made for mesh sandpaper where the hooks are destroyed under normal use by poking through the mesh and contacting the workpiece.

A:

Be sure to check whether the hooks (part of the hook-and-loop) on the backing pad are intact (not melted) and not clogged, all the way out to the edge of the pad. Usually the hooks around the edge become damaged first. If this is the case, you will need to replace the backing pad or the sander. It looks like replacement parts for your model are readily available online.
If you find that you are regularly burning up the hooks on your sander's pad, try turning down the speed if your sander has a speed control.  I burned through 2 or 3 sanding pad attachments for my oscillating tool before realizing this.  Also try connecting a vacuum or dust extractor to the sander to help get more airflow for cooling, as well as helping to prevent the paper from becoming clogged and overheating.  Or, as Jacob Edmund suggested in a comment on your original question, you may be able to replace the backing pad with a smooth one designed for use with adhesive-backed sandpaper.
