Q:

Lumber Dimensions for Brachiation Ladder (Monkey Bars)

My American Ninja Warrior watching daughter has asked me to build her a Brachiation Ladder (fancy name for overhead ladder or monkey bars).  Here's an example:

The interesting part is that she doesn't want it to be the normal 6 to 8 feet wide.  She would like it to be 12 feet wide.  The vertical supports are easy, but I'm not sure what dimensions I need for the two horizontal beams that form the ladder.  The constraints are:

Douglas Fir since this will be outside in the midwest.
Capable of supporting a 50-75 lb child swinging in the middle (6 feet from either end).  And possibly multiple kids if the neighbors invade the backyard.
Not excessively over engineered so I can still move it around if necessary.  For example, if I don't need to use 2" x 12" boards, then I won't.

So assuming a 12 foot beam of Douglas Fir, do I need a 4x4, 2x6, 2x8, 2x10, 2x12, etc?

A:

First, my flat answer: 
For a 12' span backyard monkey bar set I'd use four clear (no knots) 2x8's - two each side. Use threaded pipe flanges screwed to the inner (hidden) face of the inner 2x8's (in a counterbore) to anchor pipe sections. Assemble inner 2x8s and pipe, then laminate the outer 2x8's onto the inner ones.
Yes, that will be heavy, but not beyond the limit for two adults to move around, and reliable for more than the projected loads.
To get nitty-gritty about load calculations, please check out this handy calculator - it should provide you a good approximation of scaling for the lumber. You will have a 'live load.'
