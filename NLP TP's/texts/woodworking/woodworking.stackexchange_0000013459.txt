Q:

Aligning entry and exit side of drawbores

I don't have a drill press, so when drilling a long hole, I'll typically drill from both sides, as close as I can eyeball being orthogonal to the surface, and meet in the middle. This way, the series of aligned holes on the front are also aligned on the back side.
Now I'm making drawbores with multiple pegs per tenon, and wondering if it's a bad idea to do the same thing.
If there's plenty of stock to drill through and support the peg, would it be okay to drill, say, 3/4 of the way on one side, and try to meet from the other side?

each leg (4x6) has 4 drawbored pegs. 2 pegs per mortise. after seeing how terrible my drilling was, i decided to make the long edge peg not stick through — they would have intersected paths anyway. luckily it’s called the back side because it’s at the back

Maybe I'm obsessing over details, but that part always seems to be omitted from instructions (maybe for a good reason, I don't know). Most videos I've watched on the topic, they drill only from one side until the snail/brad point starts poking out, and then pop a clean rim for the remaining 1/16" from the back side. This is the sensible approach, of course, because it makes a straight path for the peg, and a clean exit hole but it does tend to create ugly alignments on the backside (in my experience).

A:

If you're having trouble eyeballing square or plumb as you drill when working solo (so you can't take advantage of a second pair of eyes), which is something I'm convinced most people have trouble with, then simply jig it — make a drilling guide.
That way no matter whether you drill half the thickness each way, 3/4 one way and the rest the opposite way, or almost fully through and then complete that last little bit from the other side, you can be assured you're drilling square to the surface (although in that last case it shouldn't be required to use the jig to complete the hole).
Now some very good drilling guides are made, but it's really easy to make a versatile and reliable perpendicular drilling guide in just a couple of minutes:

Regardless of the jig you buy or make, with many bits being relatively short once fully seated in a chuck you'll run into the problem that the jig itself limits how deeply you can drill. So often you'll have to start the hole jigged and then remove it to complete the drilling, trusting to the start of the hole to guide the drilling the rest of the way.
