Q:

Is it necessary to apply finish to both sides of a table top?

I am building a very large (110" X 48") dining table. I intend to finish the wood by applying Danish oil and a water-based, oil-modified, polyurethane.
Since it won't be exposed to wear, is it necessary to seal the underside of the table?

A:

Bob Flexner says it is unnecessary to finish both sides of a table top:

...finishing the undersides of tabletops or the insides of cabinets or
  chests has only limited impact on reducing the likelihood of future
  problems. The only reasons to go to the trouble are for looks and feel
  â€” both of which are perfectly legitimate. But neither has anything to
  do with stabilizing the wood...

A:

American Institute of Architects (AIA) sets the standard for commercial woodworking.  The standard requires that the finish be balanced whatever is done to one side must be done to the remaining 3.  This prevents the wood from moving in unequal ways.
Essentially you set up a situation where the grain will behave differently on opposites sides of the wood as the ambient conditions will effect the wood differently on differently finished wood. Now the average dining room table may not see conditions extreme enough to cause a problem but that is standard.
