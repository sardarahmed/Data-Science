Q:

Can i use Aspen wood for my beginner axe handle?

This is the first time i'm creating what i hope will be a well enough durable axehandle. I don't like to buy my wood, I would rather take a tree down and work from the beginning. It's feels better in some way. I have Aspen trees just 20 meters away from my house, so getting it isn't very challenging.
What i know, aspen is a medium strong wood. It flexes very badly, but it is extremely light. I am going to treat it after the head is on the handle, so things like water and insects shouldn't be that big of a problem.
I hope it's not going to be too horrible. I'm not really going to use it that much, I do this more for fun and to prove my skills. I still want it to be durable enough to be able to be used. I've cut aspen many times before and i have dried it. I know it's stiff but it seems like it can take a beating. 

A:

Yes you can do it. No, I would not recommend it. Generally speaking, wood hardness is proportional to density. Aspen is a soft wood, and as you have indicated, it is very light. In an application like this where safety is a concern (you dont want that handle flying off!), I would not use a species as soft as this. In a pinch, I would make it out of aspen and for my first project I would take down a proper hardwood (ash and hickory are generally used for axe handles).
