Q:

How to cut a quarter-pipe shaped block of wood?

I want to build a custom dice tray from wood. Here is my design:

The tray features small compartments for holding various polyhedral die, with curved ends so that the die can be scooped out of the compartments easily.
How do I cut these curved blocks? They are 1" x 1" x 1" in dimension:

A:

If you don't have access to a bandsaw or scroll saw as noted in the excellent previous answer, you can also cut a 2" diameter hole in the piece of wood with a hole saw, then slice away the corners to get four ramps from a single square of wood.

A:

1" thickness is well within the range of most saws. A bandsaw would be the best bet, followed by a scroll saw (if the wood is relatively soft) and finally a handheld jigsaw. Simply mark the curve and cut.
Ideally you would cut the profile from a longer piece of wood (so that you have something to hold on to or clamp), and then crosscut to length, with the off-cut being your finished piece.
