Q:

How do I cut a lap in the middle of a 2x6 that does not extend to either end of the board without using a router?

I need to cut a 2" x 1/2" lap in the middle of a 2x6 (5-1/2" on either end will NOT be cut...only the middle 3 feet).  Without a router or router table, what is the best way to accomplish this?
Something like this:

A:

Cut the edges of your lap with a handsaw (fine-tune the edges later with a chisel, if you like).
Cut a few more lines into the wood down the length of the lap to prevent splits from running out of control in the next step.
Use a chisel and mallet to quickly knock out the wood in between the edges.
Carefully pare down to the line using a sharp chisel and the force of your hand/body.
