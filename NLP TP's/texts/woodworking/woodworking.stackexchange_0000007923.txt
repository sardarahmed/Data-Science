Q:

How to form an indentation in wood to hold candles?

I want to make indentations to hold votive candles in a decorative piece of wood. What is the best way to do this?

A:

In addition to a Forstner bit, this can be done with a router and template. The choice probably depends on how many you're making and what power tools you have available. Depending on how deep the hole is, a "trim" or "pony" router would likely do the job.
Considerations would include:

Availability of a drill press (a forstner bit might not do a great job in a hand drill)
Cost and number of holes you can get out of a forstner bit of the right size.
Hole size of close-enough size being available as a standard forstner bit.
One-off versus production (dozens or hundreds) scale.

A:

If you want to create a flat-bottomed hole the best tool to use will be a forstner drill bit.  You'll probably want to use a drill press to ensure the holes are straight.
