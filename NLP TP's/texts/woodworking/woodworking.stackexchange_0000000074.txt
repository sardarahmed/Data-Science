Q:

Why should I avoid using the pith section of quarter sawn lumber?

The title pretty much sums it all up. When selecting quarter sawn lumber, why should the very center (pith) be avoided?

A:

The pith is what remains from the time when the tree was but a lad. It's soft and weak. Using it in woodworking would be like making something out of a bush. When the pith is exposed on two faces of a board, it will often crack and fall out.
It's also under stress. If you look at 4x4 posts at HD or Lowes, you'll notice that many of them have a split that runs from one face down to the pith. If you're going to make something that includes the pith (called "boxed heart"), you can make a cut that mimics this split and reduces the tension. Japanese woodworkers like to make this cut and then insert a piece of softwood to cover it up.
