Q:

What technique and tools can I use to create a straight canoe pole from a green tree

I'm using black spruce, white spruce, and tamarack to make canoe setting poles 12' x 1 ½" diameter. I look for standing green trees as straight as possible, maybe 1 ¾" at 13' height, then debark them to dry out.
What technique with any tools (other than a lathe) do you suggest I use to make a straight pole from these trees? 

A:

A spokeshave!
It might be a bit slow, but that's how they might have done it "back in the day".
In more seriousness, a combination of jointer and planer should get you a reasonably straight, square piece of stock, then the spokeshave would help you get it round from there.
An additional thought: Once you get the piece squared, tip your table saw blade at 45° and knock off all the corners. That will leave you with less to shave down.
