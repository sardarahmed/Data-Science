Q:

How to cut a wood plank to make kumiko ramrods?

I'am interrested in making kumiko, but I don't know how to make wood ramrods from the wood plank ?
I have access to a table saw a ruban saw and to usual wood tools.
I'd like to know how to proceed to avoid a lot of wasted wood and preserve the rectitude of the wood.
Thank you.
