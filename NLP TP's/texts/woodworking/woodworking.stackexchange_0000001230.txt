Q:

What is the name of the corner joint with grooves on this chair?

I removed the seats from dining chairs I just bought but have never seen this type of construction. What is it called?

A:

I agree with the other answers that it's best called a finger joint or maybe a finger jointed corner brace. You could also call it a box joint if you want to distinguish it from the tapered finger joints that are sometimes used to join boards end-to-end in stock made up of shorter pieces.
The point of a corner brace is to add support to the corner joint. Usually, the brace is connected to each rail with glue and screws. Using a finger joint here adds a lot of glue area in a shearing direction, so the connection between brace and rails should be very strong even without mechanical fasteners. Forming that joint in a production setting would be fast and cheap, and it would save the cost of maybe 16 screws per chair and the time needed to drive them.
I found another example at dutchcrafters.com, which describes these braces as "grooved":

A:

While the corner brace is pretty common in chairs I've never seen what appears to be a 'finger' joint incorporated with it.  But that is the best I can guess, a finger joint for the brace.

A:

This looks to be some sort of Finger joint, probably used as an Assembly joint to make it easier to assemble. You could apply glue to the corner brace, then run a screw through it, and not have to worry about clamping it while the glue dries.
