Q:

Resawing boards on the table saw, tips?

Let's say your board is 33mm thick, and you want to have two 15mm boards instead (saw is 3mm thick). A friend told me that I have to use a bandsaw for this task but what if you only have a table saw?
The problem is that something (or a very unlucky someone) will have to hold the board using a mere 15mm of the edge. I made the following jig that uses a fine-tooth saw blade to grip the less-than-half of the edge from one side and two screws to hold it from the other.

This solution works, but it is obviously not ideal since I have to remove the riving knife. Also, the piece tends to fall down the saw disc opening.
Is there a better solution?
EDIT
Thank you for the great advice! I will dismantle the jig and use the rip fence with push sticks, zero clearance insert, feather board, and a non-protruding riving knife.

This is one of those cases where it makes more sense to use the rip fence. Your jig essentially re-creates a rip fence on your sliding table, but yours is set up so that the workpiece is fixed to the fence and the whole assembly moves over the blade. The problem of how to hold the workpiece goes away if you use the existing fixed rip fence; the workpiece is supported by the fence, and you slide the workpiece along the fence.
There's a list of tips for doing that safely in my answer to Is it safe to resew on a table saw?.
If you were to continue using the jig you've built (I don't recommend that), you should, at the very least, add a cleat along the back edge. A large component of the force the blade exerts on the piece will be horizontal, pushing the workpiece backward toward you, the user. As is, the only thing resisting that force is the saw blade that holds the bottom of the workpiece. Adding a cleat at the back will at least resist that force and prevent the saw from firing the workpiece back at you.
