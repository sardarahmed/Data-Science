Q:

Where can i buy really long and thin sheets (ie.4000l x 100w x 4mm) of wood in the UK?

Ive been searching online for a few days on places to buy 3 or 4mm sheets of wood. My only 2 requirements is that it should be at least 3.6m long and no more than than 5mm thick. Am i right in thinking that the only way is to have these made at a saw mill? 

A:

You'll struggle to get anything like this from any of the big DIY stores (Wickes, B&Q etc.) and you'll most likely have to go to a timber supplier such as Brooks Brothers, Howarth, Latham Timber, Timbmet or similar.
You may be able to find a local timber merchant who will supply you with some pieces of this size but you'll find a lot of those are ultimately just resellers for some of the large national timber merchants I've listed above.
