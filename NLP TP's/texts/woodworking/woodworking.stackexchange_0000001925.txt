Q:

How to bend chipboard into a cylinder without tearing it apart?

I am currently trying to make a cylinder out of chipboard(the cardboard that notebooks are typically made out of). However, whenever I try to bend it, parts of the chipboard start to tear. How do I bend chipboard without tearing it apart?

A:

I'm going to run with the assumption that you're referring to paperboard or a thin hardboard.
Think of the paperboard as being like a sausage: it has a skin on it that keeps the good bits in, but if you bend it too far, that skin will tear.
Scoring hardboard
Your best option (steam would probably damage the board, as Matt mentioned) would be to score the board at intervals. This will allow you to control where the skin breaks. From here, you'll probably want to coat the gaps with glue or something to prevent them from becoming easy points of failure.
This will mean that your cylinder will not be perfect, it will be somewhat angled at each score line. A smaller distance between scores will help hide this.
Another option: laminated layers of posterboard/thin paperboard
If this doesn't work for you, you could try laminating instead: use a thin paperboard that's easy to use. Make a cylinder with that (You probably want to use a center form to get the diameter right, try circles made of wood). Then glue the outside and roll another piece of paperboard over that, adding successive layers until it's the desired thickness. This lamination method is likely a better option for you: it will be more durable than simple hardboard and will be under less stress. Additionally, you can overlap seams so there won't be a single weak point.
If you're using thin paperboard rather than posterboard, I would leave a small gap at the final seam and use epoxy to give it a secure seal that's unlikely to peel away from the cylinder.
