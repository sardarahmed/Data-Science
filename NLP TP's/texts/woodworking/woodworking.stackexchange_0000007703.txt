Q:

Moisture Blushing or Inadequately Mixed Satin Wipe-On Poly?

In the final step of finishing my speakers I was putting satin wipe-on poly over my danish oil.  The danish oil sat for 6 days on my walnut paperbacked veneer in my basement with a dehumidifier going.  It was approx 70F degrees and 40 humidity.  I forgot to shake on my second coat of poly and then added a shaken third.  
I'm wondering if this is blushing or moisture.  If it's blushing I can get a 'deblusher' but I need to order it and wait.  If it's the cloudy poly then I need to likely strip and re-coat.  If it's cloudy poly is there any way I can avoid that in the future?  Perhaps put a gloss down for the first 2 then a final of satin (super well shaken).
To remove the coat should I just use an orbital with 220 grit (it's on paper backed veneer)

A:

I sanded and refinished and it got rid of most of it.
