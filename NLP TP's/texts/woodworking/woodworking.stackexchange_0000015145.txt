Q:

Plane to produce beveled edges on plywood?

I have this small project of bevelling the edge on a 3 1/2" x 2 1/2"  piece of 1/2" plywood. I'm replacing and duplicating a damaged platform on which an audio speaker foot rests. I will be bevelling 2 sides which are cross grained.
Notwithstanding using a router which I don't have, I'd appreciate input and advice from experienced woodworkers on the plane they'd use for this. (I'm trying to find out if there would be a specific type of plane/bed angle that would be more effective on 1/2" ply.)

A:

Since plywood will inherently give you a cross grain planing situation (no matter which edge of your rectangles you're working with) which can be difficult, and you give no indication whatsoever of the quality of the plywood you're working with, I'd suggest an alternative:
Sand it.
With heavy grit sand paper, you'll probably make quick progress even if doing it by hand. Then as you approach your bevel angle, you can switch to finer paper to sneak up on the final bevel, then finish with a very fine grade for a nice finish.
