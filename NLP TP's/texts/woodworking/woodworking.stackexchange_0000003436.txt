Q:

Is there a software that will print large jigsaw patterns on letter sized sheets of paper?

I recently wanted to cut out a 3' spirograph using a jigsaw. I designed it in CAD and was eventually able to get something to work on a CNC router. In hindsight a jigsaw would have been just as good if not better. But I don't have a large format printer and CAD would've been a chore to use to print off all those different sheets.

Ideally the software would be specifically for this process and the sheets would fit together nicely for cutting with alignment marks or some such.

Matthias Wandel on Woodgears wrote a program just for that. I haven't used it myself, but from his own use of this it looks like exactly what you are looking for. He is selling it for 22$, but there is also a free evaluation version:
