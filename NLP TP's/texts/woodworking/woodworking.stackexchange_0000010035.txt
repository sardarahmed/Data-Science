Q:

Why is there a perfectly straight line at the edge of this knot?

This is a bit of a cheat because I am not a 'woodworking' enthusiast, but our company does make furniture. My question is simple. In the photo .. why is there a really straight line (that looks almost like a joined piece of wood) through this knot here. I've even asked the manufacturer and she says that it is natural (but she's not 100% sure so she's going to look into it). Just wondering if anyone could lend any advice here? She showed me some other photos of timber which also has really straight lines. The wood is FSC acacia.
Of course there doesn't seem to be any rational explanation for going to all that time to join two thin little bits of wood together. So it presumably is natural.
Thanks
p.s. I couldn't see a forum for manufacturing .. there was one called The Workplace but didn't seem appropriate.

A:

That board is actually two separate boards that have been glued together.  When one of them was ripped (i.e. cut lengthwise) it went through the knot.
You can see that along the entire length of that slat none of the grain flows through that seam.
