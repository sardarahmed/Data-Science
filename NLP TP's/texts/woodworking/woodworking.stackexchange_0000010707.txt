Q:

When coping baseboard do I cut the top edge square?

I'm replacing the baseboard, having laid new flooring, and am coping the inside corners. However, I'm finding I tend to break that very thin "point" on the top - either while cutting it, or when fitting to the wall.

Should I just cut it off square? And if so, do I still back cut right to the top as that would show up?

A:

The actual answer was provided in a comment to the question:

Yes, cut it back square so that the very top of the joint looks like a butt joint. That should take care of a lot of that fuzzing. [...] â€“ Aloysius Defenestrate Jun 8 '20 at 2:31

This was never clear in the videos I watched.
Once I got that part down, I was generally cutting the copes correctly first time every time - and I've replaced about 400 ft of baseboard now.
