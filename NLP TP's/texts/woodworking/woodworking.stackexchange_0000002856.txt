Q:

Sanding the final coat of lacquer?

I have a lacquered table top with some minor dust specs sitting in the surface of the lacquer. I don't want to sand it down and reapply more lacquer. Can I use a super fine sand paper (what grain?) to get rid of the dust without causing any issues? The surface is a satin finish so it doesn't need to be crystal clear. 

A:

Try "sanding" it with a brown paper bag. That will be just abrasive enough to knock loose any dust nibs. It may polish the surface, though; try it on an inconspicuous area first to make sure you're happy with the result.
Warning: this may increase the shine of the surface; depending on your needs that could be either good or bad.
(It did a fine job on the table I recently refinished, but that was glossy oil poly.)
