Finishing wood slices to an even thickness

I’m trying to make some wood slices, which I want to have a smooth flat finish, and be the same thickness across the slice (to within say 0.25mm). Ideally, all the slices would be the same thickness, but if that’s not possible, that’s less critical. The slices are from oak, and are about 60-80mm diameter x ~6mm thick. 
I’m going to run the slices through a CNC machine to v-carve them, so if the thickness of a slice isn’t consistent, the v-carving will vary in width&depth across the slice. 
So far I’ve cut a few slices with a mitre saw which gives quite a rough finish (it’s got corse teeth), then sanded them flat with a bench belt sander, flipped them over and tried to sand the other side flat to the same thickness. I’ve tried to keep the thickness consistent by measuring them with callipers and sanding until it’s consistent, but it’s very slow and hard to get good results. 
I’m sure I’m missing a better method. Should I be planing it? I’ve no experience with planes. 
I’ve got various tools including a bench sander, but not got a planer or thicknesser. Happy to get some more tools, but can’t afford anything bulky as my workshop is low on space.

Since you have a CNC router you can flatten the slices with a straight bit in the CNC.
