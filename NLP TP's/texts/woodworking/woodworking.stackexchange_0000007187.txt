Q:

What tools were used to make this toy block?

My daughter has these wooden blocks; they're about 5cm on a side. Two faces are machined(?) with various letters, as shown -- and my question is how this face was made?

It doesn't look laser-cut, because the lower surface does not look burned or charred;
It doesn't look CNC machined, because some of the gaps are impressively narrow and would require a ridiculously small machine bit;
It doesn't look "pressed" because that would probably not work on such fine details, but would just squeeze them all flat;
But then how was it likely done?

I got them for free 2nd hand, but I know that (for just wooden toy blocks) these were very expensive -- apparently it's some form of name brand, plus the painting is actually very nicely done and the wood itself is a very pleasantly-smelling sort.
Edit: Ooh, my wife explained it to me: They're Tree-D printed!

A:

There are CNC router bits as small as 1/32" (0.79mm) that would perform such tasks as this toy block. For obvious reasons, the feed rates have to be carefully managed.
A skilled operator might create the design for a larger bit to take out the open areas, then perform final passes with the detail bit. If one looks closely at the edge of the cut, it appears there is some roughness consistent with a cutting tool. Due to the tight quarters, it would be near impossible to sand those areas smooth.
I would not reject a combination of methods. CNC routing for the larger areas, detail bits for closer work, followed by hand cutting. I add the latter because of the sharp points in the corner details that would be impossible even with a 1/32" bit.
If the blocks are expensive, that reinforces the aspect of some hand work. It also allows that the entire block could have been done by hand, with appropriate tools of sufficient sharpness. The consistency of the curves contradicts that concept, however.
