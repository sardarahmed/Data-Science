Q:

Why do we use slats to make outside swing shutters?

Why do we use slats to make outside swing shutters and not plain boards ?
Also, is there any reason those slats always have chamfers ? 
Why not plain flat shutters without those vertical grooves ?

A:

I think you are asking "why are shutters made of multiple pieces of wood rather than a single board".  That's easy - very wide boards are expensive.  It's much cheaper to buy five 100mm boards and joint them together than it is to buy a single 500mm board.
The reason the boards are chamfered (or rounded over) is that it is very hard to joint together two boards so that there is no noticeable line at the joint - you need an accuracy of at least 100µm, and preferably towards 10µm.  On the other hand, if you put in a small deliberate chamfer, you can get away with an accuracy of ½mm (500µm).
