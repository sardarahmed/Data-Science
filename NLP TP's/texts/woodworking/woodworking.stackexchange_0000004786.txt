Q:

Waterproofing Wood With Left Over Polyurethane (Aesthetics irrelevant to project)

So I know the off-the-cuff answer is you cannot (or should not) use Indoor Rated Poly to weather proof wood as the sun's UV will discolor the wood and other issues visually. This wood though is being used to stack firewood and the way it looks doesn't matter at all. I have about 3/4 gallon of left over Poly and 3/4 Gallon wood stain. Both are indoor use. I'd rather just use those then go buy something new. 
My question is can I just go ahead and stain/poly the wood and stack my firewood on top? Will it help? I'm using Douglass Fir wood.  
I also have leftover exterior paint but I'd rather not paint the boards. Just a thought. 

A:

Interior varnish used outdoors will certainly work to protect wood in the short term, but I don't think it's the right way to go here. 
One reason is that a film finish like varnish will tend to transfer if pressed upon with significant force over an extended time. While that might be irrelevant to the wood being stacked it will peel varnish from the support, probably defeating the purpose of varnishing it in the first place.
If you're seeking a long-term solution to protect these fir supports from weather and decay, particularly if they're intended to be in direct contact with the ground, I'd suggest you use an old-timer's trick and soak them in used motor oil. This can apparently protect even softwoods from decay for many decades. 
You'd soak the wood for a good while (a few days at least, but a week or more wouldn't hurt if possible) to let the end grain drink up as much oil as it can, then wipe off the excess and put them to use.
