Q:

How do I stop tearout when using a dovetail jig

I am using the Rockler dovetail jig on some 3/4" walnut. I have been successful one time with this jig but I always manage to have issues cutting the tails. I am using the bits that come with the jig and maybe that is the issue. I am sandwiching my project piece between two 1/4 pieces of plywood cut to the same dimensions as the project piece.
I have already figured out how to cut the pins successfully. The method I use is cutting in small increments as well as climb cutting. I do not have to sandwich the project piece between two pieces of plywood for this cut.
Any suggestions would be nice. Scrapping some good hardwood is getting expensive.
Finally getting a chance to upload some pics here. I went back out and finally tried again. I was trying to use climb cuts to do this, and it started out alright, but by the time i got to the end it started tearing out again.

A:

In addition to using scrap to support the wood during a cut, as Bert said, grain direction can affect tear out.  In your photograph above, the cuts are being made on end grain, which greatly increases the odds of tear out, unless you can change the direction of the cut in some way to avoid pulling at the grain as you leave the cut.  I don't have any experience with routers, so I'm not sure what your options would be if you have to make an end-grain cut.
However, in this specific case, the grain should be running along the length of the dovetails, instead of across the dovetails.  (Dovetails are subjected mostly to tension forces, and wood does not have very good tensile strength across the grain.)  Putting the dovetails on the correct sides of the board should reduce or eliminate the tear out.
