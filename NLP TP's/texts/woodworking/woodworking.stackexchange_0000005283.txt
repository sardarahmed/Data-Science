Q:

Vise chop thickness?

I'm in the process of making a work bench, mostly following the Nicholson style, and with a vise like this one.
The only difference is that I'm going to be using hard wood for the vise chop, and I want to put dog holes in the top of it.
Because of cost, I'll probably have to laminate 2 pieces of wood together to form the chop, rather than using a single thick piece.
My question is this: given that I want to put dog holes (3/4") in the chop, how thick should I make it? I was thinking 2" - is that enough?

This can be stronger and more stable than one solid piece so it's often a good way to go anyway. If the piece or pieces you get are flat-sawn, alternate the grain as in the vice bottom-left of the image in this Answer.

Yes 2" would be more than sufficient. You can install dogs in vice linings much thinner than this but for the style of face vice you're making thick chops are usual.
Lining
Since you are going with hardwood you should give thought to lining the chop with leather to help prevent marring of workpieces in softer woods. 
Leather linings substantially increase grip at more modest clamping pressures anyway, reducing wear and tear on the mechanism. Not a big deal here but an important consideration with cheaper modern all-metal vices that aren't made as robustly as their vintage counterparts.
