Q:

What tools can I use to hollow out a bowl?

I'm interested in creating two types of bowls.  The first is relatively straightforward - in design, at least - as it will just be a large salad bowl.  The second is going to mimic a bowl I was gifted recently that is more or less tear drop shaped.
My question is: how I would go about removing the inside (and outside for that matter) of the bowl?  Would this process be the same for a bowl that is not circular?
Bear in mind that you're speaking to a beginner here.  If possible, please provide the investment context, ie what are the low tech (cheap) and hi tech (expensive) tool options?

A:

To turn an a bowl that is not round I am aware of 2 (3 counting BrownRedHawks comment!).
The first is to use an off-center jig, you will turn one half of the bowl, then change the jig and turn the other half, making an oval.  The one I've linked to is for the Ruth Niles jig, it's fairly small, I've also seen some videos on making your own jig.
The other is an 'oval turning device' Not exactly sure how it works but I think it does all the work of moving it around.  Here's a video of it in action.
And of course as BrownRedHawk pointed out, turning a bool green(ish) it will warp and be very asymmetrical.  The biggest trick here to keep it from cracking is to make sure that the wood is a very even thickness all around (and still fairly thin), that way it dries at about the same rate and less likely to crack.
