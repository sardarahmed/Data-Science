Q:

Weight limit of IKEA Lagkapten/Alex desk

Not sure if this the best place to ask but worth a shot. I want to put a fish tank on the end of this desk. It is a 10 gallon tank and all up will probably weigh about 65kg (water, substrate, tank included).
Any ideas on the weight limit of this desk and if it will support this tank? IKEA does not list any.
The tank is 50cm x 25cm and will be only over the top of the drawers as they are 60cm x 35cm

A:

I think this should be fine, but as mentioned in the Comments you'll want to assess for yourself.
While the knockdown fasteners that Ikea use here are not noted for being a super-strong way to put things together they aren't weak either, and the bolts or cams would have to literally tear out from the chipboard/particleboard for this to fail.
In terms of resistance to racking (any leaning side to side or back to front) back-and-forth motion is a non-issue. Side-to-side motion is a potential for concern however, but the top links the two units quite securely; so IMO both would really have to fail in order for this to collapse sideways.
I just don't see that happening under a static load.
But you must plan for unexpected dynamic loads, which could include just someone hitting the edge of the desk with their hip as they walk past.
Note: if you decide to go ahead, do ensure that all fasteners are tight before you fill the tank with water. Don't over-tighten, but make sure nothing is loose before putting this under load.
