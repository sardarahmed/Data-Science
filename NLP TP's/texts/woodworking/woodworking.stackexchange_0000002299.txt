Q:

How can I increase the door trim depth while maintaining structural integrity for a pull-up bar?

I have recently purchased a door way pull-up bar, however the trim on one side (referred to hereafter as the "back" side) is not thick enough for the pull-up bar's (unable to find official nomenclature here)

The back trim is flat, unfinished wood. How can I increase the depth of the trim such that it will be safe to use the pull-up bar in the doorway?
Simpler is better given limited access to tools (namely, a hammer).
Below is a picture showing how the pull-up bar mounts in a door frame.

A:

If you're looking for structural integrity, not pretty, simply nail a 2x4 to the wall against the flat trim. Several 16d nails should be sufficient to hold your weight.
If you need something to look nicer, you might get a 1x? (width to match the existing trim) and replace the existing trim, then stain to match. Use finishing nails to hold it up, but since you'll be putting a lot of weight on it (relative to the weight of the trim piece), use extra nails.
If the 1x board isn't thick enough to support the pull-up bar, use 5/4 lumber.
