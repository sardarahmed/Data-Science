Q:

Can you do a wet sand with a sanding machine?

I'm interested in using Danish oil. One of the approaches I have seen is to apply the first coat, let it dry and then use 600 grit sandpaper that you wet with the Danish oil for the second and third coats.
Could you automate this by using a sanding machine or is adding volatile oil to a sanding machine a bad idea?

A:

In theory yes, but it might come around and bite you later.
The effect of exposure to mineral spirits on the pad in particular is unknown, and many plastics and resins (which foam pads are made from) are attacked by it, either softening and becoming sticky and/or becoming brittle after the solvent has evaporated.

Note: this sanding-in technique is not used by all people finishing with "Danish oil" and other similar finishes which are blends on oil and varnish that are then diluted (sometimes heavily — many or even most are more than 50% thinners!)
I mention this because it's easy to make your own versions of this sort of thing if you have the three starting ingredients — e.g. boiled linseed oil, polyurethane varnish and mineral spirits — at a very significant saving. Additional benefits include:

you can tailor the mixture to your own liking, so instead of a single mix of the two finishes (1:1? who knows?!) you can use more oil or more varnish depending on how they work with the wood you're currently using;
you can vary the dilution of your preferred ratio(s) of oil to varnish to suit different drying conditions through the year;
and last but not least, you have the BLO and the poly.

So instead of having only one mixture you can't alter other than by thinning it even more you can make as many versions as you like, along with the two original finishes which can be used separately (and it won't take long to find applications where you do want them separate).
