Q:

What happened here? Wood tension?

. It was originally straight. After I ripped it (resawed?) on the table saw, the pieces are no longer straight. The thinner piece is drastically worse than the thicker one as well.
Did I release tension in the wood when I cut it? 
Any way to prevent this in the future other than cut thicker and plane it down? 

A:

You are correct about releasing the tension when you cut it.  You are also correct about there not really being a way to avoid it.  I have had pieces bow like that after planing.
My general procedure for getting rough cut lumber to size are:

Allow wood to acclimate in your shop for several days.
Face one side flat with the jointer
Get an edge square to the flat side with the jointer
Rip, resaw, or plane slightly thick - maybe 1/8" or so
Let the pieces set for a couple days to release tension
If necessary, repeat steps 2 & 3
Plane to final thickness
Rip to final width

If the wood has some extreme tension in it, it may be necessary to do repeat steps 2-6, although I have only had to do that once.
