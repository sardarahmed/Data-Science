Q:

Joints for 105 degree angle?

I am making a dodecagon (12-sided) garden planter. The 12 pieces are LHW 100mm x 63mm x 38mm. The angle of each is 105°
I'm looking for suggestions on what joint I can use.

A:

As noted in comments, you’ve got pretty much endless options.
Off the top of my head, here’s a few.
1- no joinery at all… use hoops (like a barrel) to hold everything together.
2- biscuits and glue… would require a biscuit joiner with a tiltable fence, or a benchtop jig.
3- dowels and glue… would also require a jig and a bit of precision.
4- screws and glue… you’ve got the material thickness. Easiest would be screwing from the exterior side, but that’s an aesthetic choice. You might be able to get the screws to work from the inside, but that might be tricky.
5- tongue and groove and glue… wouldn’t do this without a tablesaw or router table. (Though milling your staves without a tablesaw would be a curse.)
6- (waterproof) plywood splines and glue… slightly simpler than t&g, but still tool-heavy.
Glue should be waterproof, like titebond 2 or 3.
