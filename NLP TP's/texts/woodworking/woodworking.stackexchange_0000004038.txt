Q:

Wobbly table - maybe an easy fix

recently I've asked a woodworking professional to build me a table for my living room. 

It looks good but the problem is: it is wobbly. I can pull and push it on the direction indicated below:

I want to guarantee that he fixes the problem so that's why I would appreciate your professional help: if he builds these "triangular structures", does it fix the problem?

Would the problem really be fixed? Is there an better solution?
Sorry for using so many tags, i didn't know how to "label" the question.
Thank you.

A:

Based on a wobble going toward the black chair, then yes, the triangular braces between the table top and the legs will resolve the wobble. 
Smaller braces would be better from a design perspective, but if they're too small, they won't be sufficient to stop the wobble.
It's difficult to tell, but it looks like there are small metal fasteners holding the legs to the table top, and they look like they've got 1" - 1 1/2" "legs". It might be sufficient to beef those up (maybe double the length of each leg?) to give the table the stability it needs, instead of putting a large wooden wedge under there.
Instead of experimenting on your nice looking table, your "woodworking professional" may want to knock together a quick mock-up in cheap (low-grade, scrap) plywood to see how small he can make the bracing while still having it be sufficient to do the job.
