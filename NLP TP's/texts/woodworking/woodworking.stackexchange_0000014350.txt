Q:

How to fix a wooden chair leg that was cracked?

I assume some super glue and a nail might hold it together?

A:

No to super glue. You'll want to get a quality wood glue and wood screws at a minimum. I'd be looking at drilling in some dowel pins, maybe even sistering pieces of wood on either side of the crack. If this is "just a chair", you might want to just get a ne one. Why chance someone falling if it should fail again. It looks like a crack further up or is it just a scratch?
