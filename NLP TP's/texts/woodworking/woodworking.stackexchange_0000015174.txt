Q:

Reinforcing a console

I am building a console as shown below (not to scale). The boards are 5 cm (2 inches) thick pine. The sides are joined to the top using dovetails.
I have not assembled this yet but I am concerned about racking. What would be a traditional / time-tested way to reinforce something like this?
I have thought of three options:

A shelf attached with dadoes & tenons. This seems right, but I am not sure it will be useful as a shelf, and if not, it will take up more space than other options.
A reinforcement bar with a vertical cross-section. Is a mortise & tenon joint appropriate here provided the bar is small?
A dovetailed reinforcement bar on the back. Would this work w.r.t. wood movement? One advantage is that I can add it after the initial glue-up.

A:

Always need triangles to prevent racking.  Your options 2 and 3 are the most viable to do that. Though the 3rd option I might try 2 of them across, though the wider it is the better it would be at preventing racking.  This is why so many pieces of furniture have the entire back covered with thin sheet material.
If the back side is going to be against a wall, the easiest would be to literally screw triangles into the back top corners, they will prevent all racking.  You can also hide them a little more and make them smaller by putting in 4 just a few inches back from the edge on each corner, making it a nice 'feature', that is partially hidden.
