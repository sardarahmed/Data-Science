Q:

Variation in shades of maple wood

I went out and bought some hard maple for my desk. I've already glued the boards together to make the tabletop, but I noticed some variation in color between the boards. Two of them are somewhat dark, a few are white, and the other is half white half yellow. The white part was being covered by another board in the lumberyard, so I am assuming that maple yellows over time when exposed to UV light. This is not an issue for me, but I wanted to know if it is possible to even out the colors across the boards, and how. Will keeping the tabletop in direct sunlight help? Hopefully they can all have that nice golden-ish color.

A:

After flattening the top/ removing glue, leave the top out in the sun for a couple of days before applying a finish. That should even out the color.
