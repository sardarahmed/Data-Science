Q:

Built-in plywood desk and wood movement

I am building a built-in desk for my home office.  I plan to use 3/4" plywood over a 2x4 frame and attach the frame to the studs.  I understand that the table top needs to be allowed to expand/contract so I'm planning to attach the plywood to the 2x4 frame using cleats or similar hardware for this purpose.  The desk will be from wall to wall (~8').  Do I need to leave a gap between the plywood top and the walls to allow for expansion and contraction?  If so, how much would you recommend?

A:

The plywood will not expand or contract a noticeable amount. You will not need to use special hardware to accommodate for movement.
