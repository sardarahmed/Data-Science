Q:

Are factory edges of plywood straight?

Watching some videos on youtube, it seems that sometimes they use the factory edge as a straight edge (e.g., run it along the table saw fence to cut a parallel side). Other times they trim off that edge by running an edge they cut along the table saw fence. Does it depend on the type or quality of the plywood?

A:

If not damaged, factory edges of plywood sheets are straight and square enough for most practical purposes.
In fact it's common to use one of the factory edges as a straight reference when building a jig or tool guide.
