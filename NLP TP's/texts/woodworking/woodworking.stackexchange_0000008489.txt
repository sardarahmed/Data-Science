Q:

Filling crack in walnut table top

I'm building a table with the walnut top shown below. (Sorry for the blurry photos).
I think I should fill this 8" long crack. I need to decide how. I'm considering cleaning up the edges and cutting/carving a piece to insert and sand down. Probably something a little darker. Another possibility is a filler - I've read elsewhere on this site about wood dust mixed into glue.
I'll treat the small crack at the lower right similarly.
My question(s):

What if I just leave it as is?
If filler, how do I make "wood dust" and what glue (I have titebond
on hand)?
Any other suggestions?

Edit (since many people look at this question)
Here's the table finished. The filled crack runs behind the orange model (which is a sequence of slices of a tesseract). I used 30 minute epoxy and sawdust from the same wood.

Welcome Ethan.
Where splits are linear, I would consider a butterfly or other brace, but when the split is around circular grain, I'm sure it's usable.  Worth a try, I suppose.  A "butterfly" is a separate piece of wood that crosses the split, glued into a slot you've chiseled into the host.  It is an advanced technique, I would say, but if you're up to it, they do lend a certain beauty in my eye.
Otherwise, I would consider one of three epoxy based fills: clear, wood dust as you suggest, or if you're brave, some color contrast.  In turned products, many will mix epoxy with metal dust, color such as the primaries red, blue, yellow.  Regardless, most epoxies (do your homework) will not only adhere to the wood, but flex a bit with the change in humidity.  I have some clear patches in bowls that have been amazing at following the movement in the wood.  It was just the 5 min two part you can get at your local big box lumber store.
