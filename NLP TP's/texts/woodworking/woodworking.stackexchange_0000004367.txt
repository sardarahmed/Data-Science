Q:

Use Baby oil instead of mineral oil on cutting boards

I use mineral oil when I make cutting boards because it makes it pop. But I have not been finding any. Would baby oil be a good or decent replacement? Is there any other oils that would work, maybe even better than mineral oil?

A:

Baby oil is just mineral oil with fragrance added - so you're not going to kill anyone, but there may be a smell..
I normally use Olive Oil on cutting boards.

Over the years, my family has used a lot of oils on butcher blocks on bbq trailers and prep tables. We only use "food grade" mineral oil. There are no additives whatsoever, as with regular mineral oil and baby oil. It's clean, filtered, scent-free and resists bacteria. We use it on wood and metal surfaces, including knives and cleavers. Plus, it's only about $17/gallon on Amazon. That works out much cheaper than small bottles of "cutting board oil", which is the same oil. Just don't use cooking oils or olive oil. They turn bad in the wood, smell bad and start bacteria growth. Wipe the board with plenty of oil and let sit overnight to soak in and always do BOTH sides of the board (very important). Oiling top only can cause warping. Many wipe the oil on boards with their clean bare hand. No waste and it's great for the skin.
