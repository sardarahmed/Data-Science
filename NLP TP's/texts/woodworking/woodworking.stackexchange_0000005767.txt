Q:

What type and thickness glass should I use in picture frames?

I'm building a picture frame and am wondering what type and size glass I should use? The frame will be 16x20", maybe bigger, so I think I want a fairly thick glass. Would 1/8" be sufficient? Regular plate glass?

A:

Single strength (3/32) is the standard for picture frames, but I'd start thinking Double strength (1/8) at 16x20 or larger.  1/8 is the standard for cabinet doors, so it will be more than adequate for a picture frame.
