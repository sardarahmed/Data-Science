Q:

Flatten warped plywood

Is there a way to unwarp a piece of 20 x 20" piece of 1/8" inch thick piece of plywood?
I trying wetting one side and weighing it down with weights.

A:

Unless this board holds special value to you, any big box store will have a 4x8' sheet of 1/8" hardboard for $5-$10. If they're not too busy they'll cut it while you wait.
That said, if I was determined to work with what I've got, I'd try to reverse the warp:

Like the underside of a shriveling leaf, the plywoodâ€™s concave side
  has lost moisture and shrunk. Reversing the warp can be accomplished
  by adding moisture to this concave side and drying the convex humped
  side. I use a sponge or sprayer to wet the concave side of the plywood
  (hot water works best). Then I lay the sheet, moist side down, on a
  shop floor or a driveway. Now the sun, or the warm interior air, helps
  to dry out the convex, humped side of the plywood. At the same time,
  moisture is being absorbed into the concave side. This process works
  faster than you can imagine, so keep an eye on the material. If it
  warps the other way, just reverse the process.
