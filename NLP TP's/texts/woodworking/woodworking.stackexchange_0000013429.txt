Q:

Should thick (softwood) joint be drawbored through and through?

What are some valid considerations to help decide whether drawbore holes should be blind? (or go through the back)
I'm building a roubo-style bench with thick douglas fir legs (4"x6") and stretchers (2"x6"). The stretchers are joined to the leg with mortise and tenon. In the instructions, the tenons are preferably drawbored tight against the legs.
However, it is not specified whether the drawbore peg should go through the stretcher and leg completely (i.e. so the peg pokes out at the back of the leg), or whether to make the drawbore hole stop shy of the backside of the leg.
I have limited drawboring experience, but I have some concerns (which may or may not be considered valid by an experienced woodworker):

Longer pegs break more easily.
In other projects with softwood, I've also had chip breakage on the exit side around the peg hole.
I was planning on using 3/8" dry dowel and a 23/64" hole (i.e. hole is 1/64" smaller), and make the holes 1" away from the edge of the joint. Maybe dowel diameter doesn't change much of anything, others seem to settle on approx 1/2" peg for that bench.

It does not matter. Through hole or stopped hole, hold of pin is the same.

Reason not to bore through is if you do not want to see pins on both sides of leg, does not seem important on workbench. In theory drawbore pins through leg can be knocked out later if needed, but best of luck if you try!

In other projects with softwood, I've also had chip breakage on the exit side around the peg hole.

Does not matter. Workbench, not furniture!
Reminder: drawboring is option, not requirement. Many workbenches do not have drawbores, all joints still tight after 70+ years. How old are you? :)
Good reason to use them today is if clamps long enough are not available.
