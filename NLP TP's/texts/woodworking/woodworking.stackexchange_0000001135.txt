Q:

Should I use one large spline or multiple smaller ones for a miter joint?

This obviously depends on the thickness of the wood. When you see multiple splines on a join they use contrasting wood colors to create a nice effect. But is that the only reason? Consider the following picture:

Would it be preferential, for the strength of the joint, to have one large spine that spanned the space between the outer splines of the picture above?

A:

Joints increase in strength with the cross-grain surface area. This is the sides of the spline. 
That means more splines is better.
However, too much of a good thing is bad. At some point the cuts you need to make for the splines will weaken the wood too much.
