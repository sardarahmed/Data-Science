Q:

Making removable marks on walls for e.g. cabinet installation

I'm building and installing various cabinets and shelving units around the house, and when it's time to install them, knowing the exact stud and cross-bracing locations is very helpful.
I have an electronic stud finder that works well enough. I often want to mark the stud locations with an easily removable mark because the mark location may not be hidden by the cabinet, so I've been using chalkboard chalk. The problem is, it's not easily visible on many painted surfaces.
I was thinking of using colored chalk, just regular Crayola kids chalk to create a more visible mark. Is that a sensible thing to do?
I was wondering:

Is there a more specialized chalk suitable for that job?
Am I going to have trouble getting colored chalk off the kitchen or bedroom wall if it has flat paint?
Is there some other standard way of marking stud locations with a removable mark?

A:

When I don't want to make messy marks, it's blue painter's tape all the way. (There are various options, in terms of how long you can leave it on. Just remember to peel it in time.)
