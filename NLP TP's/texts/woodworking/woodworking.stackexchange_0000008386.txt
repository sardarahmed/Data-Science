Q:

Removing black stuff from polishing pads

I have just bought a polishing pad & sheepskin wool pad from Festool and have used them to clean up my table saw top. Now they are both covered in black stuff. 
Is there a best way to remove it and also, is it ok to use the same pads on wooden surfaces? Or do I now need to get a new set just for wood and leave the other ones to metal?
Note: I used a Festool cutting compound on the polishing pad.

A:

The black stuff is iron particles that have been abraded from the table saw top. To remove them from your pads, you'll have to dissolve them. 
The good news is, it appears that the festool cutting compounds are water-alkane emulsions, which means that you should be able to remove the majority of the residue by simple laundering with clothes detergent. I would do so by hand, and gently, given then at least one of them is made of wool. 
Following that, there will probably still be some black residue remaining. Acids are the easiest way to dissolve these. Again, given the wool composition, I would go with weakest acids first - soaking in ample vinegar (acetic) or cola (phosphoric) will probably work. If those don't work, I would use dilute hydrochloric acid (commonly found as toilet bowl cleaner) - work your way up from extremely dilute to more concentrated. Following the acid treatment, launder again in multiple washes of plain water. Remember to be physically gentle so as not to ruin the wool structure, and to only be as chemically harsh as you need to be, and be patient - the vinegar/cola might take a day or two of soaking.
