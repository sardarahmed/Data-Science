Q:

Type of blade shanks for Bosch PST 50 AE

Sorry for my novice question, but I'm looking to buy some blades (for using with wood) for my dads old Bosch PST 50 AE.

Would just any Bosch blades fit this old Bosch model?
Or has there been (or are there) different type of blade shanks that Bosch uses?
I found these blades and they are using "T-shanks", would they fit?

Has this image anything to do with what type of blade shanks is being used?

A:

Although not foolproof, you can generally figure out which style to use in the saw by the way the blade connects to the saw. In general, if you need a tool to change the blade, it's a U-shank. If you can do it without a tool it's a T-shank. There are exceptions, and this looks to be one.
Some especially old jigsaws take a U-shank blade with an additional hole in it, and unless you can modify a new blade to fit, these are becoming much harder to replace.

A bunch of saws that take T-shank will also run on U-shank too. This is "more true" with newer saws I believe. And in the interest of universal fit, Ryobi (and probably others) make blades that are supposed combine features and work with "any" saw.
Based on the age of the saw, my first thought was that U-shank blades would be the most likely fit, but looking around the Internet makes me think that that particular model uses T-shank blades or, more likely, either kind of blade.
There are a couple of current ebay listings for that specific saw which include assorted T-shank blades. That seems to suggest that T-shank is the fit.

Also, JDV has shared a link for a YouTube video that shows the procedure for changing the blade with a similar Bosch saw model that seems to use T-shank blades and a long screwdriver that came with the saw.
I have also found pictures of the reverse side of the saw which features a label that seems to specify which blades are recommended for different materials.
