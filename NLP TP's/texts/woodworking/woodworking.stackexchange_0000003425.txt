Q:

What type of lathe do I need for duplicating parts

I've worked with a lathe maybe a few dozen times, making things like wooden salad bowls, goblets, baseball bats, and some other relatively simple items.
I'm looking to buy a lathe, and one of the first projects I want to make is a very large chess set (ie: 8" tall king) as a gift to a friend who is an avid chess enthusiast. I've found some stencils for the pieces I want to make with a lathe, but I've only ever used fairly simple lathes. I don't really know what to look for when it comes to a lathe with some sort of modular chisel guide that allows sheet metal stencils to be installed to act as a guide.
What type of lathe should I be looking for if I want to use stencils to create precise replicas of the same part multiple times?
Thank you. 

A:

I would recommend finding the lathe of your choice.  I personally like my Jet, however there are many great lathes out there.
Then you buy a duplicator for it.  Rockler has a duplicator that fits most standing lathes and will duplicate up to 39" material.
Here is a Grizzly attachment for their lathes.
So as I stated in the beginning.  Find a lathe that meets your requirements (there are many to choose from, with many different options available).  Then worry about your duplicating abilities.  Unless of course you want to buy a dedicated duplicating machine (big bucks).
