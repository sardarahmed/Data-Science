Q:

Clean and protect cabinets and railing

Wanted to clean and protect the cabinets and railings in our house. They feel very dry to touch and ones in the bathroom look dirty. But first I want to understand what kind of wood was used for these. I tried to read up on kinds of woods on these blogs and it helps a bit but not enough.

Hoping to do some sanding, wood conditioner, some staining, and polyurethane. Still debating if I should use stain on it as it is making it too dark. Someone was suggesting if it is a nice kind of wood then I should go this way. Otherwise, I could use RUST-OLEUM Cabinet Transformations Kit. 
That's the story. Any direction would be helpful. I'm hoping to keep it light in color as cabinets cover a large area and will make the kitchen look dark.

A:

Dry to touch is not a problem. Likely a bit of wax is all you need, if that. Wood for cabinets is probably plywood with hardwood face; be very careful if you insist on sanding. Looks fine as is; what do you want to accomplish by refinishing?
