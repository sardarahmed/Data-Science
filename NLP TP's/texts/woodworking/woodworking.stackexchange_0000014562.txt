Q:

Clamping long glue ups

This is a very basic question and I can't figure out the right Google query: how should you clamp glue ups of long seams?
For example, say I'm glueing a pine 2x2 to a 2x6 to make a ledge to support slats to support a twin mattress (75" seam). That's 1.5 x 75 x 150 pounds of pressure. Clearly I don't need 112 small clamps. But what do I need?
Edit: I looked at this question but there was no practical answer (which, based on comments on this question, is "fewer clamps than the math says plus a bunch of screws").

A:

I tend to use clamps every 12-18" (min 2) when gluing things up, and in your case I'd tend to add some screws as well. The screws would be for added strength after the glue has dried.  Every wood bed frame I've seen has the screws holding on the ledge.
