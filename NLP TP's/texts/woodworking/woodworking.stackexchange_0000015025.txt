Q:

How to build this wooden box

I am open to all your thoughts and suggestions!
I want to build a wooden box that looks like this (measurements are in inches):

The idea is to have a 5 boards: floor, ceiling, back, and two walls that protrude 3 inches past the ceiling. There will be no front, so that whatever I keep inside the box will be visible at all times.
The numbers I included are idealized numbers. They do not take into account the thickness of the wood. When I take that into account I will need to increase the height of the right, left and back panels to accommodate that - and just make sure to space the top and bottom boards the proper distance apart.
EDIT: (updated to be a single question)
I am planning on using wood that is somewhere between 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick. What is the best way to fasten these pieces of wood together?

A:

As a beginner using wood < 1/2" thick, I'd recommend glue as the appropriate method of fastening this project together. A glued joint will end up being significantly stronger than the very thin wood you're going to use for this, so any failures will not be in the joints.
You could probably nail it together with very fine tacks, but with minimal, beginner skills, you could easily drive the nail through the face of the board you're nailing into and/or split something.
I will echo Graphus' comments about doing some basic reading/watching to learn more. A couple of my personal favorites, available on public TV (in the US) are The New Yankee Workshop and The Woodwright's Shop. The former will teach you a lot about quality construction using power tools, and the latter the same but with traditional hand tools. You'll end up using both in your woodworking journey.
There are a bazillion content creators on YouTube. Be cautioned: they're not all good. Some will teach you some very bad/dangerous habits. Use common sense!
