Q:

Does the wattage of the drill have to do with wood working?

Currently, I am browsing a local store via mobile device app. It shows a bundle of tool, it states:

Bosch Go (screwdriver) + GBM 320
Bosch Go (screwdriver) + GBM 350

Will there be a difference between those two? considering woodworking also deals with some metal and concrete sometimes

A:

As Graphus mentioned in a comment, the wattage is indicative of how powerful the drill is and more powerful drills can drill bigger holes. Per the product pages for both of the drills you mentioned, the GBM 320 can drill 13mm holes in wood, while the GBM 350 can drill 20mm holes. It gives similar specs for drilling in steel. How precise those specs are is unknown, but it gives you an indication of what you can expect from those two drills.
