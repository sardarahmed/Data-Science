Q:

How can I install an adjustable leveling support leg in a table?

I'm building a big working table, and it has 4 legs of 90mmx90mm. I want to put some leveling mechanism that also protects the wood uneven floor.
I found these pieces in Ali Express as I could not find anything in local shops (Diameter 80mm, thread 12x100mm):

My question is, how do I install this in the wood?

A:

Here's what I'd do...
Those leveler feet are often sold with T-nut fasteners. If not, you will also have to purchase appropriately sized T-nuts.
Bore holes in the legs so that the threaded shafts will fit inside and install T-nuts in the bored hole. Turn the foot/threaded shaft to the desired height and tighten the nuts back against the T-nuts to lock the height.

Other options include leveler feet that screw on to the side of the legs like these available from Rockler (and a slew of other retailers) which look a little more robust and might be better suited to a heavy workbench-like table:

I wouldn't recommend T-nuts for this.  They're best used on the opposite site from where the bolt is inserted, as they can't resist any sort of pulling force or moments if the foot should get kicked or get bumped while being moved.
I would use a threaded insert.  It's a cylindrical piece of metal with threads on both the inside and outside.
The outside is a coarse thread for the wood, and the inside is a finer thread for the metal bolt.  Some are also 'key locking' in which there are parts to hammer in to keep the insert from being able to rotate out (or further in), or 'screw locking' in which the outer threads are a bit irregular to create extra friction.
Make sure you buy inserts for the correct material -- they make them for wood, plastic, and particle board.
