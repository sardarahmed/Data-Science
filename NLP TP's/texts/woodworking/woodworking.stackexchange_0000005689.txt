Q:

How deep will sandpaper penetrate?

This may not be important, but it was something that I would find pretty neat to know. And the question is simple, how 'deep' will a given grit (36,80,120,etc) tear into the wood. I do not think there is much more to be said. 

A:

You can see the diameter of the average grit in a piece of sandpaper here:

Assuming the grit is embedded at least 1/3 of this diameter, you would "cut" into the wood about that far per row of "grit".  So it depends on the length of your sandpaper (a 1 inch piece of 80 grit sandpaper is going to cut less than a 10 inch piece per stroke, probably about 10:1 if I had to guess).
But really sandpaper does not "cut", it more tears or smashes the wood fibers.
