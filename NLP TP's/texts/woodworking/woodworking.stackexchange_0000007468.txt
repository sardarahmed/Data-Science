Q:

Handsaws for very small flooring project

Is there one excellent-quality handsaw that does both crosscuts and rip cuts, and, if not, what two handsaws should I buy?  The task is to install either an engineered wood, or possibly hardwood, floor in a small (165 sq ft) room.  Speed is not important but neat, precision cuts is. I am a highly-motivated novice.  If hand-tools are totally inadequate for the job, what is the minimum set of power-tools?

A:

A Japanese-style double-edged pull saw would be perfect. One side is for rip cuts; the other is for cross-cuts. As a bonus, they're flexible enough to also cut your door jambs flush with the new flooring.
