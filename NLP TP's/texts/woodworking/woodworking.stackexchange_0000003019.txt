Q:

How to clamp where clamps cannot reach?

The jaws and throats of most clamps don't allow much space for securing deeper on larger panels, boards or pieces. Sure, toggle clamps can be placed anywhere but you need to damage a surface in order to place them. 
There are deep throat clamps. I found some that are 8 inches deep and that is good. But if you needed to clamp something that required a deeper throat it would not do.
I am picturing some sort of jig using boards to span from the edge of the work to the clamping location but I don't see that having enough downward pressure. 
Forgive me if I lost you up until this point but for an extreme example: What if I wanted to clamp down a drill guide in the center of a 20 inch square board? 

A:

The long board clamped across the piece is a valid plan. But to get the downward force where you need it you'll need to put something between the board and the clamp area. 
A simple candidate is a block of wood and a wedge to fine tune the clamping force.
You can replace the wedge with a screw that will push against the block.

Note that the board will flex as you add clamping force so you may need to readjust all previously applied clamps.

A:

Some sort of caul.  You can make one to apply pressure at a single point, or have a slight curve to apply pressure more evenly across a panel.

You can always make long-throat clamps, like these ones by Matthias Wandel:
