Q:

Finish Sanding before or after wood burning in a design

I am starting to get into pyrography and I am completing my first design; I am wondering if I should finish sand before or after I burn in the design? It would seem that after burning in the design an edge is formed that should probably be sanded down but I am afraid that sanding could rub out the design.

A:

I would finish the sanding as much as possible prior to burning then once you have finally finished carefully hand sand with a finer grit to remove the edge.
