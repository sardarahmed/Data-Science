Q:

How can I get this effect with resin inlay?

I have a poker table design that I have started CNCing components for.
There are walnut sides with blond diamonds inlayed.
In the blond diamonds, there are some engraved letters that I am going to inlay with resin.
In the solid model, these are outlined with black--and I really like the way that looks.
Is there any way to get this effect with an inlay?

A:

Disclaimer: I've never done this before. I've never worked with inlay or resin, either. This answer is based solely on intuition.

Use your CNC machine to rout out the full size of the blue letters and black outlines into the light diamonds, then fill them with blue resin.
After the resin has cured, put it back into the CNC and route out just the black outline, then fill with black resin. Aligning the resin filled piece back in the CNC machine to ensure the black outlines are carved out properly is an exercise left to the reader.
How well the black will hold with wood on one side and more resin on the other is way above my pay grade. The resin manufacturer may be able to tell you how well their product will stick to a cured version of itself.
Obviously, this may require some experimentation and test pieces, and end up with somewhat thicker black outlines than you'd desire in order to get the resin to flow and to stick. But, that's what the testing is for.
