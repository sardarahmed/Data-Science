Q:

Help getting Delta fence accurate

I bought a Delta 36-725 on Craigslist after seeing a lot of really positive reviews on it, especially about its fence. However, I can't get my fence to lock down accurately at all. When the fenced isn't locked down, it has a TON of play in it. Moving it side to side causes it to twist, making it really hard to accurately place it, especially when making small adjustments. When I do lock it down, it will be out of alignment one way or the other depending on which direction it was twisted.
Is that kind of play back and forth normal for this saw? Is something broken or not setup correctly?
Here's a video that might help explain what I'm talking about: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eELYh1CX33am5iQKiN1j_8pryoRMmgmH

A:

I had tightened the adjustment screws down further based on some other comments I've seen online, but it wasn't until I went to Lowe's last night and looked at the one on display that I realized that they needed to be screwed in even further. After adjusting them so that they were actually below the surface by a few turns, and then adjusting it from there to make them even, it finally slides back and forth smoothly and locks down consistently.
