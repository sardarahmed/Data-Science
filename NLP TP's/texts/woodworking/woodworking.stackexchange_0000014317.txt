Q:

How to attach legs to a custom torsion box

I am making a table for my dungeons and dragons group. This is the second version of my table, here was my first.

For my first table I used 3.5" fence post legs because the table wasn't going anywhere, and it was cheap and easy to cut the post to fit what I needed. This makes the people sitting at the end have limited leg space however.
Below is a picture of my next design. It measures 72" x 54" x 5". I would like to maximize leg space, without compromising the stability of the table. With 6-8 people around the table, leaning on it during gameplay, and a TV mounted in the middle, can I place the legs at the corners of the TV? Would it still be stable? What is the smallest diameter legs I can use without to maintain stability? Am I forced to place the legs at the outside corners?

A:

Moving the legs toward the center creates a greater risk of the table tipping over. This is a significant concern with so many people leaning on it.  Think of what happens if more than one or two people on the same side are placing weight on the top at the same time.
The obvious traditional answer has been the pedestal table with a center post supporting the top.  That design style will use braces near the floor extending from the center pedestal out in four directions to create a stable base to resist the tipping forces above. To make this type of design effective the top, pedestal and leg braces must all be well secured to each other and extend out towards the outer edges of the top.  In addition, the depth of the top and bottom cross braces should be 3" to 4" deep to properly transfer the loads from horizontal to vertical and back to horizontal.
Of course, you can dress up the design details to suite your style, but the basic structure should be maintained.
