Q:

How to highlight imprecisions?

Using only hand tools, I made a groove for a wedge and the wedge does not fit tight and perfect. How do I highlight where the exact point is that needs to be reworked? I've seen someone using carbon paper or some other compound but that cannot work with a wedge. In another words how do you mark gaps, to highlight tolerances and so on?
Another example, I have a curved piece of wood and I want to make another piece of wood fit to the curve perfectly. Again how to highlight any gap or wood excess? I know I can use light but there are certain cases where you cannot use light.

Have you tried using chalk?  A light coating of chalk on the piece you want to fit, then try it out, make it snug so it 'rubs' on the other pieces.  All the high points that need to be sanded down should show wear where they rub and the low spots would be untouched.
After 1 or 2 rounds, might need to clean up the chalk because it will tend to spread out over everything.
BTW I'd use white chalk, any bright colors might be hard to completely clean out of all the pores.   Others who've used this method prefer colors to help visually, so what ever works for you!
