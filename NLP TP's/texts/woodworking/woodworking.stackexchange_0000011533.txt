What is "medium duty" versus "heavy duty"? Is there an official definition?

There's no specific definition of "medium duty" or "heavy duty" as those terms pertain to woodworking tools, and the same is probably true in most other contexts. The terms are essentially marketing terms that manufacturers use to suggest the intended use of a product or to differentiate similar products within their own product line. Moreover, the meanings may vary significantly depending on the specific products or the context in which they're described.
It's generally understood that "medium duty" suggests more toughness and durability than "light duty," but less than "heavy duty," even if none of those terms are precisely defined. Think of these meanings in terms of condiments: when you order a sandwich at a delicatessen and the person behind the counter asks if you want mayonnaise, you might say "heavy mayo, please" or perhaps "medium mayo" or "light mayo," and even though they're not measuring the mayo and if asked you probably couldn't even say just how many grams of mayonnaise are indicated by "medium mayo," everybody still has a pretty good idea of what you mean.
There's no authority or governing body that controls, defines, designates, or authorizes the use of those terms for clamps or other tools. Consider them as advisory if they help, or ignore them entirely and evaluate the products in question yourself.
