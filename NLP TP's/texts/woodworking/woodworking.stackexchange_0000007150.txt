Q:

How best to dry Ebony?

I've recently acquired a plank of roughly cut, dipped in wax Ebony. The piece is roughly 5ft x 8in x 2.5in. 
I've got a lot that I'd like to do with this piece - the largest of which is a decorative item that will use about 2ft of the plank. 
What is the best way to go about getting the wood ready to work? Should I cut the plank into the smaller pieces that I need or work on drying out the whole thing?
I've read that with Ebony, one should really take their time - but I'm also itchin' to get working. Are there any tried and true methods to help speed up the drying process? 
I probed the Ebony with a moisture meter on the end and in the middle and the readings were: 16.1% in the middle, 10.4% on an end. (Portland, Oregon is where I am and where this board has been sitting)
Here's an image of the goods, btw:

Given the value of this piece of wood, I'd say trying to speed things up is not a good idea.  
You could remove the wax from the middle, so the moisture has some sort of chance to exit via the surface.

One thing you might want to check, is your moisture reading.  Most moisture meters just apply a voltage to the wood and measure the (tiny) current, and then turn that into a moisture reading via some sort of look up table.  The lookup table is probably correct for construction timber - it wouldn't surprise me to discover that the resistance of ebony is rather different.  (Being denser, it will have a naturally higher conductivity so the moisture may actually be rather lower.)
