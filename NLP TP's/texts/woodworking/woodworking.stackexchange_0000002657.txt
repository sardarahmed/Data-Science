Q:

I was thinking of buying a router. I tried a router bit in my power drill. It didn't work

I used the router bit in the following setup and moved the work piece.
Note this picture is faked but it gives a good idea.

The problem is that the resistance was enormous and if I forced it, it just chewed the wood up. It kind of destroyed my idea of how a router should be and I don't have an opportunity to try a real router before buying.
Question
I'd still like to buy a router but I'm no longer confident that it would cut a lengthwise slot in a piece of timber such as shown in the picture.
How come the router bit didn't work in the power drill?
What is so special about a router that would make it work better?
Should it do the job smoothly, cleanly and quickly with little pressure?
Is there a lot of difference in the effectiveness of a router by price? Why?

A:

A router spins at around 20,000 RPM. Your drill, at top speed, is closer to 300 RPM. Very different animal.
