Q:

Can you use Festool dust extraction with non-Festool tools?

I'm looking into HEPA vacuums and dust extractors and I found Festool. Does anyone know whether we can attach non-Festool tools to their dust extractors?

A:

Yes this is not a problem however you won't get the anti-static properties. Depending on the tool you might need an adapter to match the tools dust port size.
