Q:

What's this substance that was found fully-enclosed in a eucalyptus blank?

This glassy, opaque item was deep inside a eucalyptus blank. There was no indication from the outside of the wood that there was anything inside, so it must have been grown over while the tree was alive.
It appears to be connected to / part of a small branch that was trapped inside; does anyone have any idea what it might be? It didn't chip like glass, and was only slightly harder than the surrounding wood.

A:

Looks like sap/resin that trees produce when they are damaged (e.g. by grown-in branches). It indeed hardens over time and can be trapped within the growing tree.
