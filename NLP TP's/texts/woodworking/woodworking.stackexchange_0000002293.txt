Q:

What is the difference between a $40 dado blade set and a $240 dado blade set ... besides the price?

I see that dado blade sets start around $40 and go up to $240+
I am wanting to get one as a gift for a friend that is helping me build a small bookshelf. The $40 is much closer to the price range I'd like to spend, but I don't want to get him something he won't use. 
Should I get him the $40 set or just a gift card to the local hardware store?

A:

When I'm spending money I like to read the negative reviews on a product online.  This tells me what is wrong with them and I can decide if the issues are something I can deal with or if it happens to be an 'unlikely' occurrence.
Now with a dado set, the first question would be how much would they likely be using them, and what quality of tools do they normally buy?  I have a $240 set sitting on my wishlist at Amazon, because it rated very high and was a high quality set.  It's been on there for 4-6 years.  So while that is the set I would really like, as long as the set isn't crap, I would likely be happy with a much cheaper set.   The big thing is will I have to replace it after some medium use?   I also generally avoid (after experience) buying the cheapest of any tool, as I usually end up buying another one not too much later.
So the point is: know your person.  Some care very much about what tools they get; others, not so much.  If he doesn't have a set, then he might really appreciate them, but he might also be saving up for a nice set and if that was the case getting him a gift card to help might be the best solution.  Ultimately, asking him which he would prefer might be the safest option.
