Q:

When working with polyurethane glue, how long does one have to clamp the components?

I am going to be building some shutters for one of our windows and because of its location, planned on using polyurethane glue, specifically Dap Polyurethane Construction Adhesive. Each shutter will be made of four five-inch boards, dowelled and glued together. They will be clamped in two dimensions, one to compress the individual boards together and the other to keep the shutter flat. Each of the shutters is 76Â½ inches long and twenty inches wide.Once the glue is applied to the boards, dowels, and holes, the clamping process will probably take several minutes. How much time do I have to get everything together before the glues is too dry?Edit: I am planning on using five clamps to hold the boards together and two to keep the whole thing flat.Edit 2: The boards are pressure treated.

A:

As a more general answer, all glues will include directions/instructions which will specify the working/open time (how long you have to get everything aligned and clamped), the amount of time to remain clamped and a full cure time. 
These times are approximates as temperature and humidity can play a role in the overall time, so assume the times given are for average temperatures and humidity values.  Usually warmer temperatures mean faster cure times.
You should pick a glue that has appropriate times for your specific project needs.
