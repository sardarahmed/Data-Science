Q:

Taking apart a wood cabinet that has been glued together with Gorilla Glue

Is there away to take apart a wood cabinet that has been glued together with Gorilla Glue without destroying the wood?

A:

Gorilla Glue is a polyurethane-based adhesive.  As such, you might be able to use a solvent that dissolves polyurethane to try to break down the adhesive and remove the glue.  Likely you will have to let it sit and constantly reapply the solvent to get the polyurethane to break down.
We just had a Question about storing solvents that you will find helpful in determining what might dissolve your Gorilla Glue.  Some solvents that may work are:

ethyl alcohol (the kind you can drink)
methyl alcohol (only drink it if you want to go blind)
lacquer thinner

A:

Dissolving gorilla glue is not easy. Paint stripper methylene chloride is the only chemical that will do it. You need to take a clean sharp paint scraper and wedge it slightly in the joint. Place a little MC in the space and work at it slowly. GLOVES. MC resistant gloves. Playtex melts. Tap squirt massage pat squirt. Go slowly. then a coating of MC and wash with laundry soap  and hot water with SS brush.
