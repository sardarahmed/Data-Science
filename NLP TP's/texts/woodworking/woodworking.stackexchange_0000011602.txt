Q:

How to remove a board that's *really* stuck

I am building a built-in that uses walnut ply boards for the seating/TV area. I tried to position the board you see but now it's stuck. The left side is sticking out 0.25" more than the right.

I'd like to pull the board out without damaging the finish so I can sand/cut some of the material away to make more room, but with both hands and gloves, I cannot budge it.
What options do I have to remove the board?

A:

Bow it up in the center, this should reduce the overall length allowing you to pull it free. Another person or two would help - have a hand at each end of the board, and pull up on the center. Hopefully the board is flexible enough to wiggle out. You may be able to use clamps to substitute people holding onto the board and a clamp in "expansion mode" to bow the board upwards.
If not, I would hammer it gently from below from one of the sides, this way any damage to the finish would be on one side only. Then if you shorten the board a little to make it not such a tight fit you could remove said damage.

A:

If the hand method suggested in the answer from Eli Iser does not work, consider to lightly clamp (with pads) each end to the frame underneath. The purpose of the clamps is not to tightly attach it to the frame but to prevent lifting.
Create simple wedge shaped shims from scrap wood with a short taper at the front and an extended flat portion for the remainder of the length, which should match the width of the board to be lifted.
Tapping in the wedge shims will lift the center while the loose clamps hold the ends down, providing the bowing suggested in Eli's answer. Once bowed, one clamp can be fully released, allowing the entire board to be lifted free.

It may be necessary to create a more-gradual taper on the first set of wedges to be inserted, followed by a more-abrupt taper to get sufficient lift overall.
