Q:

How to assemble kitchen base unit cabinet?

I am building a kitchen base unit (frameless type) out of melamine plywood. Regarding the assembly of the "box" is it OK for the side panel to rest on top of the bottom panel, where the screws will go up from the bottom? This means that the edge of the bottom panel will be visible, though that is not an issue for me.
In most, if not all, of the pictures and videos I have seen so far the side panel goes adjacent to the bottom panel, and the screws goes in from the side.

As LosManos said, a picture can be very helpful in these kinds of situations.  However, I think I have an idea what you mean.
It really has to do with what kind of strength the board need to provide to the case.  Melemine does not have a lot of strength to hold a screw from pulling straight out.  So if zipping in screws to the bottom is what is mostly going to be holding the top and bottom together, it will be fairly weak.  If you don't plan to move it, such as permanent kitchen cabinets, then this isn't such a big deal.
Otherwise, I would make a stronger frame on the inside where you can put shorter screws through a cross member (without going all the way through the melamine) This would be a stronger case and less stresses on the screws in the weak material, the shearing forces would be better than direct pulling.

Setting the sides on the base is fine -- good, even -- as long as you have structural support between the floor and the base of the cabinet. That way, the load on the cabinet is being carried by wood, not screws. 
The way you've seen it elsewhere is generally because the sides go all the way to the floor (thus carrying the load directly through the sheet goods). 
And your comment about the bare edge might be solved with "edge banding tape".
