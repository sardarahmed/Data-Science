Q:

What do Kerf, Dado, Rabbet, Tenon and Mortise mean?

I'm looking for an explanation of the terms.
Dovetail I can pretend to understand, as it is what it is. But Kerf? Dado? Rabbet? Tenon and Mortise? There are of course many more but these are my current concern.
I know what a kerf is, but the name does not match common parlance and to my mind begs an explanation?

A:

Kerf From Old English cyrf, cutting, a cuthttp://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kerf
Dado I can't find an answer for this one. But this is an interesting read: http://www.woodworkinghistory.com/glossary_dado.htm
Rabbet From Old French rabat, a recess or reduction http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=rabbet
Tenon From Old French tenir, to holdhttp://etymonline.com/index.php?term=tenon
Mortise From Old French mortaise, same meaning; possibly from Arabic murtazz, fastenedhttp://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mortise
Mitre From Old French mitre, possibly in reference to the shape of an ecclesiastical mitrehttp://etymonline.com/index.php?term=miter
