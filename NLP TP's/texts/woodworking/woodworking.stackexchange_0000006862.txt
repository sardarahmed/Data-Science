Q:

Border looks strange after grinding floorboard

We had in Germany a red color on our floorboard called oxblood (Ochsenblut).
This is how it looked:

We asked someone to grind our floorboard. Although we like the outcome, the border looks somehow blurry. Can someone guess why this happend? The ground has been oiled. I would like to know how this could happend and what is needed to fix it. Here are some example pictures:

A:

When floors are sanded it's commonly done using two types of sander, a belt sander for most of it and an orbital sander along the edges. I think what's happened here is simply that the edges haven't been sanded enough, so some Ochsenblut remains. 
The belt sander that is used for the majority of the floor is much more aggressive and capable of removing wood faster and more easily. The sander used at the edges is not as aggressive so more effort and care are needed to get the edges to match the main area done using the belt sander.

In short, more sanding (concentrated along the edges) should resolve this issue.
