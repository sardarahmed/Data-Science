Q:

Smooth round over on large pieces of wood

I'm thinking about building a country kitchen table. The link below is the design I'm considering for the frame.  
What I'm trying to figure out is how the woodworker got those large round overs so perfect. 
Also, I see an amazing lack of fasteners. I recognize that the 2x6 construction allows you to hide fasteners, but I do not see any in the cantilevered pieces either. 
Wood putty or some tricky joinery?

To get round ends on the bottom, use a band saw

Wood putty or some tricky joinery?

No wood putty needed or tricky joinery needed.
Some of my ideas on how to create the hidden connectors.

For the long span – Mortise/tenon – easy to do. The middle pieces are cripple from the top to the span board.  Another cripple from the bottom up to the span board.
The center post can be made of three pieces laminated together.  The two outer pieces use screws on the backside to fasten the 45^ brace 
The top pieces are also laminated with either 2 or three layers.  On the bottom layer, use screws to connect to the angle brace before laminating the top pieces

You can go to this woodworking projects sites (and others) for free plans on how to build one similar to your design.
