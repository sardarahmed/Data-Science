Q:

How do I avoid tearout when planing end-grain?

I am making a birdhouse and wanted to ensure that the two sloped sides of the box were the same height so the top flap would sit flat on both sides.  I grabbed a block plane to do this and had really horrible tear-out.  Thankfully,  I was able to rip the oops mostly off and finished the job with a sander, but I feel like this is something I should be able to do with a block plane, but maybe my technique was wrong.
Is there a way to plane on an end grain that will eliminate tear-out, or is it a universally bad idea and one should go for the sanding pad instead?

A:

Everything I've read says you need to clamp a waste block on the end of your board to prevent the tear out.  It is even recommended to do this if you are using a router or jointer.
By keeping the pressure on with a waste block it won't be able to splinter down the board.

Of course the other option would be to plane toward the center from both sides.

A:

plane inwards from edges.
chamfer the far edge and angle the plane.
support the edge with sacrificial wood.
use a shooting board.
