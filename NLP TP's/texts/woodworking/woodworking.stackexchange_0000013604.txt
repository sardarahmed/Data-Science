Q:

How to attach 1/4" thick plywood to 15/32" thick plywood at 90° and being able to remove and attach again?

I am working on a small project to build something like this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BBL7W46 and the part where I am stuck is how to attach a 1/4". thick plywood to two 15/32" thick plywoods at 90°.
Here are the pictures to give full idea on what I am talking about:

My initial approach was to glue it but it will become permanent. I want to be able to disassemble for storing purposes and assemble when there is a need.
EDIT: Purpose of attaching this 1/4" plywood is to be able to just support any photo frame leaning on it and not really load bearing or anything like that. Something like this:

Simple, quick and dirty solution:
Screw or glue a piece of wood to the bottom of each of the half-inch sheets. Should be somewhere around 1" by 1" (or larger) and across the length of the sheet. Now you can use threaded inserts or throughbolts and a nut to attach the 1/4" sheet to these blocks.
This way you don't have to screw into the narrow side of a plywood sheet which can be tricky or simply delaminate the plys if you are not carefull. Also, like Volfram K said, holes near the edge of the 1/4" will be weak. This will give you some space to move the holes inwards.
The lower "block" won't be visible, the upper one a little bit (depending on size and perspective). But since I'm guessing the whole thing will be painted anyways, you can just incorporate it into the design.
