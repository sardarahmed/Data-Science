Q:

What is this accessory from a mixed set of drill bits?

I bought a new set of drill bits the other day, and there's a hollow plastic tube with a spring inside - any idea what it is and how it works? I'm guessing something to do with centring?
Edit to add - I've no idea what to call the drill bits in general, but it's this set (Erbauer 4659X):

Also, looking at that site, I think it's something called a screw starter - still not sure what it's for though...

Aha! (and I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one who was mystified):

(they're for holding flat-head screws in place whilst you start screwing, so associated with the screw-bits, rather than the drill-bits)
