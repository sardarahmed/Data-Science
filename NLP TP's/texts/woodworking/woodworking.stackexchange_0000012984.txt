Q:

Best tool for sanding and shaping irregular surfaces

I am looking for some recommendations on sanding irregular surfaces, like rifle stocks.
I have tried a random orbital sander but it is not giving me satisfactory results, and also it is difficult to handle the orbital sander on this type of structure.
This is what I'm working on:

A:

You could try a sanding disk on a drill. Similar to what is used to sand wooden bowls, for example here.
It looks like the challenge with the orbital sander might be its size, thats why a small sanding disk on a drill might allow you to approach the gunstock on more comfortable angles.
