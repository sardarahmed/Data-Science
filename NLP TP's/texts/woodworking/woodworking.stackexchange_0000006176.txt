Q:

Cutting a 45 degree bevel on all 4 sides of a small piece of wood

I am trying to cut a piece of wood that will be the top to a ring box. The box is 2.5"x2.5" and 1" thick, I am trying to cut a 45 degree bevel on each side but I am unsure of how I should do this. Would using a mitre saw be the best option or is this piece to small to use a mitre saw?
Essential I am trying to create this shape (section view):

In the way of tools I have a jigsaw, mitre saw, hand saw, mitre box, chisels, router, palm sander, and a drill press that I can use as a make-shift sander. I could also probably get access to a 10" band saw.
Thanks!

Normally, being rather new to woodworking, I refrain from providing answers to people's questions, but I think I have a method that might help here. 
If you start out with an oversized piece of wood (say, 3x4x1) you should be able to clamp a sacrificial board to your piece and cut at least 3 of the 4 sides with the mitre saw set to a 45Â° cut. For the last side, I'd recommend clamping into a mitre box and using a hand saw. Cleaning up the piece with sanding should be fairly easy at that point.
