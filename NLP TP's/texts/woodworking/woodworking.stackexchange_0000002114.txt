Q:

How to can I repair/mitigate rot in the center of a Western Cedar tree round?

I want to turn a large western cedar tree round into a low table for a covered outdoor area.  
The round is from a 100-ish year old cedar tree.  It was freshly cut (one month ago), is roughly 4 feet in diameter, around a foot thick, and has some rot in the center.  How should I deal with the rot?
This will not need a fancy finish, but I don't want it to look shabby either. It is something that will sit outdoors in a covered area under a deck between two chairs in the shade and next to our garden. Think iced tea or cold beer on a hot day.

As a corollary to my answer on your other Question:
Removing the rot will not only help keep the rest of the log rotting along with it in time, but it will also help with cracking in that you won't have the center pith.
There are many ways you could deal with the rot.

Your original question mentioned drilling out the rot, which will work fine.
You can chisel out the rot and smooth out the sides of the hole.  This could also be done with a hatchet or other rough implement, but the finish may not be as nice.
It is possible to stabilize the rot by flooding the area with epoxy, letting it penetrate all the way through the piece.  
You could also drill through the thickness and use a long Sawzall blade to cut out the center.  See this related Question.
If you're very careful, you can even burn the rot out.
