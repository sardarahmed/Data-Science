Q:

Is wood glue a good sealer to prevent water/moisture leakage?

Context. I'm trying to design cheap interior doors, for areas including the bathroom.  Such doors will have hardwood frame and veneered plywood on the outside, but filled with chipboard.
Goal. Make sure that water doesn't reach the chipboard.
Question. Is wood glue adequate to achieve goal?  If not, any recommendations for water-proofing chipboard?

There are different types of wood glue with varying degrees of water resistance. I suppose that if you coat the substrate with TiteBond III you’d add some water resistance. That said, if I wanted to seal a wood product and make it waterproof, glue wouldn’t be my first (or even fifth) choice. I’d use one of the many products intended for that. If you Google “waterproof wood sealer” you’ll find quite a few good options. And as Graphus already noted, the finish that you put on the door may be enough by itself.
