Q:

How do I prevent static on vacuum hoses?

Whether sucking up large amounts of sawdust at once or when attached to a tool, static electricity always builds up on my shop vac hoses when the dust passes through. This leads to messes on the hose and other annoyances. It can make emptying the vacuum difficult too.
How do I stop this from happening?
Can I somehow ground the plastic hose to something? I don't understand electricity enough to know how to do this.

A:

Well, large dust collector systems will somegimes run a bare copper wire from one end of thd ductwork to the other, grounding one end, due to (apparently unnecessary) fear of static-ignited dust explosions; you could try domething like that and see if it helps. Presumably you'd want to use stranded wire for flexibility.
Please report back if you find something that works.

A:

There are dust collection systems which are built with anti-static features at the collection point, hoses and tools.  Festool is an example of such system where the hose and dust extractors work together to prevent static buildup. 
In this system, there is no wire used but rather the hose itself is capable of conducting electricity since it's made from a "high-carbon plastic", so the tool is grounded via the hose to the extractor, which is then grounded to your electrical system.
