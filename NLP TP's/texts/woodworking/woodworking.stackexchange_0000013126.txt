Q:

Restoring old furniture finish

I have an old table that I'm working on. I initially was just taking off the wobbly feet and putting them back on more firmly. But I was wondering if there's a good way to fix up the scratches. There's a top surface which looks like this:

And then legs that look like this:

I'm not sure what kind of coating was applied originally. For the top, it would be somewhat feasible to sand it down and start again. But I'd rather not because there are lots of matching fiddly bits around the side and on the legs (as you can see) that would not be easy to sand and recoat and so would likely end up not matching.
I guess my ideal would be to touch it up somehow. But I'm interested in any opinions and thoughts on this.

A simple way to touch up scratched finish is with scratch cover products. I have never used one, but I think you will get a good visual result on the scratches from the images I have seen showing 'before and after':

I won't link to specific product as this one remains oily, but all give similar results.
The watermarks I think will remain and have to be dealt with on their own, for many tips see How do I remove a watermark?

I'm not sure what kind of coating was applied originally.

The top veneer is walnut but the legs seem like pale wood with dark finish. Unless the table is antique and has never been refinished it is colored lacquer or varnish 100%.
Maybe you could touch up the legs by small brush or sponge using a similar product? Gel stain in walnut/dark walnut tone may give the right result.
P.S. Gel stain can also be used as scratch cover because more remains in scratches after the surface is wiped off, so maybe you can do the entire table with one can.
