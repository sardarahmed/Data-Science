Q:

Strength of plywood walls for built-in bookshelves

I am planning on building built-in bookshelves that would span the length of a wall.  Each unit would consist of a cabinet base ~2' across with a set of bookshelves mounted on top. The depth of the cabinets would be ~2' and the depth of each bookshelf would be ~12".
The plan is to construct the cabinet and bookshelf carcasses out of 3/4" plywood, then add hardwood face frames to each unit. 1/4" (or 3/8") rabbets would be cut for each shelf. Also, the cabinet and bookshelf would have plywood backings mounted, probably 1/2".  Everything would then be mounted to the wall and each other.
Is the strength of the plywood enough to hold up the weight of the bookshelves + books without bowing?  I would like to avoid it, but should I go with additional upright 2x4s between each unit for added support?

A:

I just put 3/4" plywood down as the floor for my new shed. Granted, it's on 16" OC joists, not a 24" span, but I expect the shelving that will be going in there to be significantly heavier than any 2 foot shelf of books could be and I'm not worried about the strength of the plywood.
