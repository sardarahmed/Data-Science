Q:

Just realized our deck was built with CCA pressure treated wood, what shall we do to eliminate or reduce the harm?

I just learned that the green stuff overlapping the wood board is a pretty positive sign that the pressure treated wood contains arsenic. We just bought a house and didn't realize until now. The CCA woods are in lots of areas. Instead of replacing all of them, is there any effective way to reduce or eliminate the toxic? Perhaps paint them? Any suggestions of what kind of paint?
Thank you!

In the immortal words of Douglas Adams:
Don't Panic
Arsenic impregnated wood is not that toxic.  Obviously, you don't want to make a baby teething ring from it, and if I had to sand it, I would work outside and wear a mask.  There is also general consensus that you should not use the wood as firewood (because the ash is pretty toxic).
However, apart from that, I wouldn't worry about it.  See this from the government of Victoria in Australia.
