Q:

Is a long router bit safe?

There are some really long router bits from my second favorite router bit company that have straights with blades from 2 to 3 inches long. 

Is that safe in any way? 
Is it more of a thing where as a part of the bit dulls you move it down or up? 
Can you use the whole thing (like for flattening a side of the board) and it will not bend? 

I would love to get the bit for that purpose like the 2 inch for flattening the sides but I am not sure.

A:

1/2 inch or 1/4 inch? I'd generally avoid really long bits in a 1/4" chuck for fear of deflection and maybe even breakage.
However, 1/2", with really small amounts of stock removed are perfectly fine. I'll often use pairs of 2" cutters (one with a bearing; one plain) to put a flat surface on 3-1/2" stock. (Corbels and stuff like that.)
