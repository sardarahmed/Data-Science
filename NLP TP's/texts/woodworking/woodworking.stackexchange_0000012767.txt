Q:

Splinters in wheelbarrow handles

I have an old wheelbarrow with wooden handles. It works great, but I keep getting splinters from the handles. Sanding the handles hasn't solved the problem. The surface is too rough. I thought about treating it with something used to resurface a deck. Before I do something like that, I thought I'd check with the experts around here.
How should I treat the handles to prevent splinters?
N.B. I think the handles are ash, but they are so old that it's hard to tell.

A:

It sounds like you keep your wheelbarrow outside, as I do.  I recently sanded my wheelbarrow handles and treated them with "spar urethane" to solve the same persistent splinter problem you've described, and I expect it will prevent further oxidation and degradation of the wood during continued outdoor storage.  "Spar urethane" or "spar varnish" is a polyurethane or varnish that includes a UV blocker.  It should protect both from sun and rain.  I used the same stuff for the rigging and spars of a home-made wooden sailboat that lives outside but under a cover and in that application I have needed to reapply after 5 years or so.  The wheelbarrow is not under a cover and may need more frequent touch ups.

A:

I used cloth adhesive tape. It worked well and probably has a better grip and feel than duct tape. You could also get some sports tape, like that used on hockey stick handles or baseball bats.
