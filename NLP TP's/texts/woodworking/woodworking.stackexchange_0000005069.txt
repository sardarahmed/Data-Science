Q:

Sander in lieu of grindstone?

Odd thought just went by: 
There are sandpaper-based sharpening systems ("scary sharp" and it's cousins), generally using fine wet/dry sandpaper on a flat surface like plate glass.
There are motorized versions of this, typically spinning a disk of sandpaper mounted on a similar flat plate. And I know narrow-belt sanders are sometimes used by knife makers.
It just occurred to me to wonder whether an appropriately mounted/jigged sander I already have on hand -- belt or disk -- could be (ab)used for this purpose.
So: Outside of the usual problems of holding the blade reliably at appropriate angle and not overheating and the like, can anyone suggest reasons this wouldn't work? I suspect buying or building  a proper slow-speed  grindstone would be sufficiently better to justify its cost, but I could see this possibly being useful on a worksite....

A:

For flat blades (chisel, plane) you're going to struggle getting to a fine finish. Most sand-paper sharpening systems have you placing the paper on glass or granite, so as to have a dead-flat reference plate. The metal plate inside a belt-sander is not likely to be flat enough for sharpening. The flexible pad in a random-orbit sander will certainly not be flat or rigid enough to give you a flat edge.
That said, a belt sander is great for rough-shaping or re-shaping a blade, say if you need to get past a big nick in the edge. It is only effective for the roughest work though, after which you'll need another more precise sharpening method.
Turning tools and knife blades have their own set of rules and requirements, which I am not qualified to answer.
