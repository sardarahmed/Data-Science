Q:

Planing a laminated curve

Preface, I have not worked with a planer before.
I have a curved piece of wood which was created by laminating three 1/4" oak boards over a form.  The curve looks good but I would like to clean up the edge.  I can do this with a sander of course, but was wondering if I could pass it through a thickness planer.  Basically place the piece on its side (its about 3" wide) and pass it through.
Is this "safe" to do on a planer? Should I pass the form through too to provide support?  

A:

It depends the exact profile of the curve (how "thick" it looks to the planer), but I would hazard that a thickness planer is not a safe option for this. Due to the irregular surface that will be given both to the rollers and the cutting head, I would be concerned that the piece tips over unexpectedly while inside (probably at the beginning, before the second roller engages).
Bracing the curved piece in a form that is the same height as the width of the piece will alleviate these concerns. 
However, due to large amounts of glue in the laminated wood I would worry about marring the planer knives. Matthias over at woodgears.ca documented this effect from running plywood on his jointer. Commercial plywood is probably rougher on the knives than your laminated oak (with only 2 glue lines), but together with the risk of going through the planer I wouldn't try that.
