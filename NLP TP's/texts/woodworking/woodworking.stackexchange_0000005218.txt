Q:

How do I fix a warped shoji door?

It is warped like the picture shows, basically one of the corners moved out of the plane of the door and moved everything with it :-)

I am not sure if this is because the wood dried out or because I did something wrong. I carefully measured everything when I built it ..

A:

I would guess that there are two possible sources for the problem.  
First, your long board may be warping.  This will be the result of grain direction or stress due to humidity/moisture changes.  Search this site for other Questions dealing with warping to get more insight into how warping occurs.
Second, your screwed connection may be putting stress on the corner resulting in the lifting.  Try disassembling the piece and see if the boards lay flat.  If so, it may be that you have over tightened the connection and created stress.
One thing that might help is to make certain that the boards are laying flat on the work table during assembly.
