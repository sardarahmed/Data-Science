Q:

Surface mounted hinge for 45 degree corner cabinet

I am new to woodworking and have built a corner unit in our ensuite bathroom. I am looking to find a 45 degree corner hinge which is surface mounted (I am unable to use a hinge with a mortise due to the material the wooden door will join with). My doors have a 45 degree bevel edge because the housing is square. I have probably poorly designed it which is why I am struggling to find anything but I am where I am and want to try and proceed.

Here is a crude diagram to try and explain my set up. The red circle is where the hinges will be placed.

[Edit] A normal hinge pushes the face side edge into the wall

Wow, that took me some time to understand the issue you were facing.
A surface mount hinge is what you want, you just want to specify a cabinet surface mount hinge such as this one:

This hinge will mount on the face surface of the cabinet, while the leaf will mount on the back side of the door, so it will be visible with the door closed. They are available in a wide variety of finishes, so you should be able to find something that will match the aesthetic of the cabinet and room.
If you're looking for a hidden surface mount hinge, the other option is to install your leaf hinge between the cabinet wall and door edge, much like the hinges on the front door of your house. Depending on door size, etc, you could surface mount or mortise it in. You might have to make a slight rabbet to accommodate the barrel of the hinge itself.
It would look something like the (very crude) green hinge in this image:

This would still leave the barrel of the hinge exposed to the room, but it would be much less obvious than the surface mount hinge above.
