Q:

Does a thickness planer's platen need to be absolutely flat?

I just bought my first thickness planer, a DeWalt DW735.
I received it today and, after I'd broken down and disposed of all the packaging, I noticed what looks like curvature in the mirrored surface of its platen, sort of like a dent in shiny car paint. Sure enough, I could feel some "waviness" when I ran my hand over it, and a second check with a level confirmed that one quadrant of the surface has a small hill that rises up to maybe 1/32" - 1/16" higher than the rest. The remainder is very flat.
Will this cause any difficulty in achieving good results? Or is there anything I'm not aware of about how a planer works that implies that this might not cause problems? On this model, the platen appears to be made of sheet steel that attaches to a cast aluminum base beneath it, so maybe the sheet steel has enough give that it will flatten against the pressure of the outfeed roller on the material? When I press down on the platen, it does give slightly and appears to flatten out onto the surface of the base beneath it (the flat section of the platen doesn't have any give to it, but this "bubble" does). Maybe the material will do the same?
I bought it brand new from a factory-authorized online retailer, so exchanging it is certainly an option (I've already emailed them), but it will be a pain. I can try it out and use the factory warranty if needed, or ask for a replacement base, but the platen and base are sold as a complete unit and do not appear to be user-serviceable so I doubt the latter is a viable option.

A:

If the surface isn't flat you'll end up getting snipe when your board runs off that bump. The cutter head will be removing material relative to the bed, so any defects in the bed will certainly translate into how the cutter meets the board.
