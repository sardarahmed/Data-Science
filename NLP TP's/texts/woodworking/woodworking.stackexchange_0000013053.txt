Q:

How to connect dust port from Dewalt table saw to Shop Vac?

I recently bought a Dewalt Model #DWE7491RS table saw and it has a 2-1/2" dust port (2-1/4" inner diameter).  I also have a small size Shop Vac that has a hose with a plastic nozzle at the end that has a 1-1/4" diameter (1" inner diameter).
For the life of me I cannot figure out how to connect the table saw dust port to my shop vac.  I have looked and looked and looked online and I can't find any adapters that will fit.  I have found some 2-1/2" hard plastic adapters, but they are exactly the same size as the table saw dust port so they don't work.  I either need something a little larger to fit over the table saw dust port or a little smaller to fit inside it.  This is driving me crazy.  I feel like with a popular table saw like the Dewalt this shouldn't be that difficult.  Anyone have any ideas for how I can accomplish this?

You would use this type of adapter which you can obtain from any of the big box stores in the shop vac department.  This adapter kit handles 2 1/2, 1 7/8, and 1/1/4 hoses.

If you don't want to use the 2 1/2" hose first, you can attach the adapter with this rubber coupling.  If it is a tight fit, just heat the rubber first with a hot air gun.  Do one end at a time, wear gloves

Thanks to some of the comments I figured out the solution. I was thinking about this wrong! I was looking for a hard plastic adapter that would go right on the dust port of the table saw. After reading the comments I realized what I needed to do was attach a hose to the dust port FIRST, then attach adapters to the hose. Today I bought a universal kit that included 2-1/2" hose and some adapters and it worked perfectly! Thanks so much. I knew I was just not thinking about this the right way.
