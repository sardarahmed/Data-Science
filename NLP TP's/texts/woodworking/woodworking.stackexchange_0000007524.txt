Q:

What are some good ways to cut 1/8" strips of hardwood?

Considering quality of cut and safety, I'm looking for suggestions on good tools/methods for cutting 1/8" knife blanks. The other dimensions would be 6-8" and 1.5-2.5".
I make straight razor scales out of 1/8" blanks, however until now I have been limited on selection and paying a premium. However I have not found a good way to cut such small pieces of wood safely and efficiently.
Currently the tools at my disposal are a very nice Bosch 12" radial arm saw and a very old and craftsman table saw on a wobbly stand with no guard.
I would prefer to do this with the radial arm saw but I am concerned about the quality of the cut since I can't really hold on to, or clamp the side being cut.

A:

There are several ways to do this.  The radial arm saw would probably be my last choice, though.
If you can find material 1 1/2 - 2 1/2" thick then you could just rip strips off of this with your table saw.  This would probably be the easiest.  Rip cuts (where you're laying the board flat on the table and reducing its width) are what table saws are designed for.
If you can't source material this thick then you'll need to resaw a board.  (This is where you'd be standing the board on edge and reducing its thickness.)  You can do this on your table saw, but a band saw with a wide blade would be preferred.  Either way you'll need a tall fence that is absolutely parallel with your blade, both vertically and horizontally.  Make sure the board is flat and the edge on the table is well jointed.  You should use push sticks to keep your hands well clear of the blade.  Also, if you're using the table saw position your body so as to avoid being hit by the work piece if it kicks back.
