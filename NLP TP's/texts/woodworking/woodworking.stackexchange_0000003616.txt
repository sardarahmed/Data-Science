Q:

Which kind of hinges for a foldable box?

This is the top view of a kind of folding box, actually a henhouse. 

The goal is to meet those three requirements:

totally foldable when not in use, as flat as possible so that it's easy to move and store.
a free standing position when a wall is not available (area=100)
an against the wall position when it's possible to use an existing wall.

Each panel would be a light frame with chicken wire attached on it. 
How can I solve the problem with the second hinge. It needs to somehow rotate in both directions. I don't see how this could be solved with permanently attached hinges.

You could always use hinges that are designed to have the pins removed regularly.  These are called "loose pins," and resemble that depicted below.
You would install them so that they fold in the direction you want for your box and arch configurations and just take the pins out for storage.
Edit: now that I look at it again, these types of hinges would be very useful for your box configuration since they can "complete" the square and keep it from coming apart while still being disassemble-able, which is something that the two-way hinges can't do.

Edit #2: As you've indicated, where you live you haven't been able to find these types of hinges.  They would be simple enough to make with normal hinges by removing the pin and replacing it with a custom-fit pin that you make yourself.  A bent nail would work (the ones linked above recommend a 20 penny nail as a replacement pin, for example).

A:

What you need is a double acting hinge. Different manufacturer's make variations but essentially they have two sets of pivots so that the door leaf can swing in either direction. I have seen spring action double hinges at home centers, but you can also call a local hardware supply company for variations.
