Q:

Pre-conditioner on seep through stain?

I'm staining a table and some stain got through between the boards of the table when I did the other side. Should I pre-condition over the stain that seeped through?  Sand down that stain a bit first and then pre-condition?  Just not pre-condition?  I should note that as soon as we saw that stain (while the stain on the other side was drying) we wiped it off immediately - so it shouldn't have set it much.  Thanks in advance!  

A:

If you are staining both sides, the best course of action would be to sand down to bare wood. Otherwise, the old stain will show through the new stain (if you use the same stain again, those will be darker areas).
