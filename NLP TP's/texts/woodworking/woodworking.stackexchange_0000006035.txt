Q:

Is 55W enough for a sander?

I have been looking at buying a Black & Decker Mouse sander which is 55W.
Will it be enough for general use such as sanding wood edges?

A:

It depends on what you're doing. Those mouse detail sanders are for getting into corners and doing light-duty work. I would not call it a "general use" sander unless you have a lot of time to kill and enjoy having your hand go numb.
For sanding edges, it may not be much more efficient than hand sanding. If you are sanding a small end table, it will take a while but you can do it with a mouse sander. If you need to remove a lot of material, you would be better off with a belt sander or an aggressive orbital or random orbit sander, and if you need to sand a large tabletop and progress through finer and finer grits for a nice finish, you should consider a random orbit sander with a dust port that you can connect to a shop vacuum.
Note that there are many other features which have direct practical implications when it comes to sanders, such as dust removal, stroke length, ergonomics, and size of pad or belt. I've never even considered the wattage when purchasing of a handheld sander.
