Q:

Can I add a longer bar to my chainsaw for milling lumber?

I've got a Stihl MS 271 with a 20 inch bar and I love using it to mill up logs into pieces I can use. I often run into larger stock that would really be easier with a longer bar.  That said, the spec says my saw supports up to a 20 inch.  I don't use it often so its not like I'm going to be running a 30 inch bar day after day on hardwood.  Think a few hours a month max.  
Is it safe for the saw if I put a longer bar on it? 

A:

Generally I wouldn't recommend using a larger bar than is recommended.  I think the biggest issue is you will burn out your saw.  
However, there is one thing to think on that might make it more 'ok'.  When milling with a chainsaw there are special chains (ripping chains) and bars you can use to reduce the strain on the saw.  Like other blade, most chain saw chains are designed to cut across the grain, and when you use those to cut along the grain it takes more work for you and the saw.  
My recommendation would be to talk with a stihl dealer and find out if you can go longer if you use the bar and chains for milling.
Found the following information about the mills you are asking about 

The general rule is, the more power your saw engine has, the faster the cutting speed. Almost any engine that runs will cut, it just depends on how much time you want to spend milling your lumber.
