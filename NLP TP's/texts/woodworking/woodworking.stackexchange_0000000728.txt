Q:

What is the best way to enlarge a hole with my cordless drill?

Whenever I try to make a hole slightly larger with my cordless drill, the drill bit catches and wanders, and doesn't stay centered. Normally I use twist bits, but I'm pretty sure I would have the same problem with most (or all?) other types of bits (e.g., brad point, spade, hole saw, Forstner). I know I could fill and redrill the hole, but that would be a pain, I'd have to wait for the filler to dry or cure, and I'd have to re-mark the center.
How can I quickly and easily enlarge a drilled hole without moving the hole or having to resort to some other tool like a drill press (which often wouldn't be practical) or a router jig (as mentioned in Enlarging a stepped through hole -- which would not work for small holes)?

A:

If you use some sort of bushing to guide the drill and keep it on course.
I use these from Big Gator Tools at Woodcraft.

A:

The short answer is to use a guide. 
You can take a larger piece of hardwood and drill a hole of the larger size through it, then clamp it over the hole you wish to enlarge. 
If you're lucky and the hole you wish to embiggen is the 'next' size up, a step drill bit may work, too.

A:

There are times when Bondo can save the day. Fill the hole then 10 minutes later re-drill.  Yeah I know, Bondo is crass, but it works.
