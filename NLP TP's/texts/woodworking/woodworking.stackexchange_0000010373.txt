Q:

Struggle to cut material with router, dull bit?

I want to cut 35mm holes for European-style hinges in melamine. Because I don't have a drill press, I decided to cut the holes using a router with guide bushing and template. 
I'm pretty new to the router world so I don't know what is normal and what not. When I try to cut the hole with an 8 mm straight carbide bit it is almost impossible to cut it in one go (13 mm deep cut). I feel a lot of resistance and also lots of smoke comes out. I feel a 13mm deep cut in melamine should be pretty easy. 
It is possible that my bit is dull (borrowed from my father in law, unknown quality) or is it standard behaviour? My router is a Makita RT0700 and it does not feel like it lacks power whatsoever...    

A:

The problem was a dull bit, as suggested in the comments.
I just purchased a new CMT full carbide bit and now everything works as expected. No smoke, no burn marks, just cutting. Although even if it is now possible to cut the hole in one go I decided to cut them in two steps. I use a palm base, so it feels more secure to remove material in smaller chunks.
I also use a shop vac to clean sawdust between cuts.
