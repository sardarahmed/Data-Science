Q:

Can it be predicted when a board will bind?

I was recently ripping about an inch off of a 6/4 thick, 5" wide board, and had the kerf close up on the riving knife. Thankfully the knife saved me from kickback, but I'd still like to avoid this situation in the future.
Is there a way to tell how a board will move when ripped by looking at the grain, or is it pretty much random?

A:

Internal stresses in the board that are released when cut cannot be entirely predicted, no. A square, flat, straight board might rip or resaw into a problem piece.
That being said, a cupped, bowed, or twisted board will often yield a smaller board with similar problems, even after going through the process of squaring / truing up.

A:

I've never noticed any predictable pattern when ripping timbers.
If you get a particularly strong or stubborn piece, you can knock some pre-cut timber wedges into the saw groove on the outfeed side in order to prevent excessive pinching, hammering/pushing them in as you go along.
