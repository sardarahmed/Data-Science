Q:

Table saw bogging down more than usual

I just installed a fresh 40 tooth blade (I don't remember the new blade brand name) into my table saw. I was cutting some hickory and it was burning so I figured it was time to sharpen/clean. But when I was cutting that same hickory at the same rate and everything else I noticed it struggled to cut. The saw has a 15A motor and has never had this problem before.
And I mean bog down; it was dying, I swear. So I stop feeding it and ran back up and fed much, much slower. 
The stock was only a 1/2" thick. The blade was 3/8" above the wood and I do what I have always done when cutting (which is pretty much how school taught me last year when in wood-shop).
I did not see any wobble (or at least more than usual, there was always a small amount but never hurt the performance). So I don't know what is happening but I have to feed pretty darn slow compared to before. It may be the cold, since it is winter and I have a shed without heat, but it always just spun right up and had no issue.
Any thoughts?
Note: if I had to guess on feed rate (And I mean GUESS) I would say hard woods take me 4 seconds for a 1" board without bog (now its like 5-7.... ) and softwoods like 2 seconds for a 1" board.

A:

Test the same blade on some softwood you've cut before as a control. Still bogging down? It's the saw. Rate of cut the same as you're used to? It's the hickory and you just have to live with how slowly it's cutting. No matter how slow the cut feels you can console yourself with the thought that it is far faster than ripping it by hand with a panel saw!
Your TS's motor is probably not that powerful if it's a smaller, relatively affordable model and the hickory might be particularly tough (remember, wood constantly varies) so there may not be a problem, it could just be how slowly this wood is cutting on this saw.
