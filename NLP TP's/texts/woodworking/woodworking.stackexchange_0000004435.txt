Q:

Bullnose router bit, 1/4" shank, 1/4" radius, bearing guide DOESN'T EXIST?

I am having the hardest time finding a 1/4" shank, 1/4" radius (1/2" diameter), bullnose router bit with a bearing guide. It's almost as if there is some mechanical reason why this bit can't exist?! I see this bit with 1/2" shanks in various places or a 1/4" shank but without the bearing, but nothing is like what I described. 
So thisâ€¦ but with a 1/4" shank:

If there is a mechanical reason why I can't find this, please explain (like, "routing bullnose puts too much pressure on the shank...", or something). I would be interested to know. 

A:

There is no reason I know of.  In fact I have one in my shop.  Check out here for one source.  Their image does not show the guide bearing.  My bit has a screw hole to accept standard bearings and you can call them to confirm the hole is still there.  I'm also sure they sell the bearings in a variety of diameters. Good Luck.
