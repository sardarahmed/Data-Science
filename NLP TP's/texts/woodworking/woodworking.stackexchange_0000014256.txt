Q:

Dimensions of DeWalt Table saw DWV9470 Hose

I have a Record Power Dust Extractor with a 4" inlet pipe.

Looking to hook this up to a DWE7485 table saw using the DeWalt DWV9470-XJ AirLock Y Splitter Hose Kit
https://www.dewalt.co.uk/product/dwv9470-xj/airlock-y-splitter-hose-kit
Does anyone happen to know the dimensions of the DeWalt Y Splitter hose kit? I need to know what I need to step down to from the 4" outlet.
There's no mention of pipe dimensions on the DeWalt site.

A:

According to the listings of a couple of vendors — e.g. Toolnation — the diameter is 32mm.

Y-adapter
2 x flexible suction hoses (each diameter 32 mm / 1.4 m)
2x AirLock-adapter (DWV9000-XJ)

As this might help for similar searches, typing "DeWalt DWV9470-XJ diameter" into Google gave results on the first page.
Like on the DeWalt site numerous other listings don't give the diameter, including the ones on Toolstop and Amazon.co.uk, although the latter does go to the trouble of listing the exact dimensions of the box it comes in (‎44.96 x 34.8 x 12.7 cm) and that it's 130.41g..... those last .6mm and .41 grams, so important :-|
But anyway, you can get to it by another route: what it's compatible with. Even the Amazon listing for the DWV9000 Universal Connector includes:

Universal allows for quick, easy and durable connection between 1 1/4" Vacuum hose and various DW tools & shrouds

1 1/4" = 31.75mm.
Note that there's no way to know which direction the rounding occurs, in case this might affect fit to any third-party adaptors you end up using.
