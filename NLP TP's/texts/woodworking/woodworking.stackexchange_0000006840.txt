Q:

Should I build basement shelving so it's square with the wall or with the floor?

I want to build some basement shelving units but my basement floor slopes away from the wall for drainage purposes. I'm not sure if I should build the shelving so it's square with the wall or with the floor. Here are the pros/cons that I could think of for each method. 
Square with wall

Pros

Will look straight

Cons

Technically crooked
Can't relocate to a flatter location without being crooked

Square with floor

Pros

Technically straight/square
Can relocated to other area

Cons

Will look crooked with gap at top against the wall

Is there an obvious reason I'm missing on why I should do it one way over the other? 

A:

Another solution you did not list would be to go ahead and build the shelf to be square itself, then shim underneath it to level out the floor. That way you can move it anytime but also make it look straight against the wall.

A:

Expanding a bit, perhaps, on rob's answer, cabinetry (including shelving units) should be level and plumb (so aligned with the earth's gravitational field) and shimmed or scribed/trimmed/fitted as required to fit it to the space it occupies.
This is generally important to its function, so things don't roll off or fall over for example. It also may be the best looking (or close to it) because as humans we have a keen sense of the gravitational field we live in and things will look "off" if not aligned with that, even if the adjacent wall or floor is slanted. I'm not saying that will look great in that case, just that making the cabinet match isn't necessarily going to make it look better, and it definitely won't feel better in use when things roll around or books fall over.
