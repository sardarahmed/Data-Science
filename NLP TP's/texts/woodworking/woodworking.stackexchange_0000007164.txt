Q:

Cross cutting narrow stock using a track saw

I have (very) limited working space and I intend buying a track saw in order to do rip cuts, cross cuts, beveled cuts. I cannot fit a table saw unfortunately.
I was wondering, can I cross cut 2x4s using the track saw using the aluminum track?
Does it make sense? Can I sag the track as most of it would be unsupported? Should I clamp it to some sacrificial scrap wood, below the track, at its ends, in order to prevent the sagging? Should I take totally different route?

A:

There is no reason you can't use a track saw to cut 2x4s if it is able to cut that deep. What I have found very helpful is to get a sheet of foam insulation board (not white bead board) to use as your saw table this gives you a platform to cut on protecting the surface underneath (floor or benchtop). To cut 2x4s just prop up the other end of the track so you're not fighting with it trying to move on you as you cut. While most suited for sheet goods and flooring plunge cuts the track saw is a very versatile saw and easily replaces a table saw while saving lots of space.
