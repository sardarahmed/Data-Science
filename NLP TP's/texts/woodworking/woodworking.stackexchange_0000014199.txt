Q:

Screw Placement for Wall Hung Top Cabinet

I have to fix a top cabinet with no floor support to the wall.
What is the difference if I were to place the screws which hold the cabinet to the wall at the 4 corners inside the cabinet (diagram 1) vs having 2 of the corner screws shifted to the centre of the cabinet (diagram 2)?

A:

The difference between the two placements is torque. In diagram 1 all forces act downwards (at least the ones that matter, there might be other components to it, but these are negligible). All weight is more or less equally distributed on all 4 screws.
In the second diagram, you basically built a lever. Without knowing dimensions or weight distributions, this might or might not be a problem. The weight on the far right pushes down and if there is no equal force on the left, you are inducing a rotational force around the middle screw. Again depending on dimensions etc. this might cause the left screws to not be loaded at all (or even upwards) and all the weight is sitting on the middle screws.
For fastening systems that rely on downward force, like a french cleat, this might be a problem. Also consider that depending on the unsupported width of the right part, the force exerted on the middle screws can be significantly higher than just the wight of the cabinet (you know... levers).
