Q:

What is a good choice for wood to build painted vanity cabinet doors?

I'm going to build paint grade shaker style vanity cabinet doors. I will use 1/4" plywood for the panel. I haven't loooked, but I'm guessing I can find 1/4" Birch plywood.
I'm not sure what kind of wood to use for the frame. I'm thinking poplar might be a good choice since it's plentiful and looks pretty nice. Price is a factor and I want something that's relatively easy to work with tool-wise. I'd appreciate any suggestions.

A:

You can use anything, pretty much. I mean you wouldn't want to use balsa but anything you'd typically find for sale in a lumber yard that you might consider making furniture from — including pine and even some types of spruce — will do you.

I'm thinking poplar might be a good choice

Poplar is a good choice. It's often the go-to pick for paint-grade work because it's a fine-grained hardwood (so no issues with hard and soft growth rings you might get in a softwood), inexpensive, and available almost everywhere. And many consider it too unattractive to use unpainted anyway ^_^

A:

Since you intend to paint it you can use whatever is cheapest. The caveat is the cheaper stuff is usually the softest (e.g pine, poplar, etc.) and isn't necessarily the pretty stuff. Although it's a matter of personal tastes and preferences.
In my part of the world, sassafrass is pretty cheap right now ($2.60/bf) and pretty good to work with. Where you are, there may be something similar that you can take advantage of.
