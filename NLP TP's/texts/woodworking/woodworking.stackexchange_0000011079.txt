Q:

Solvent for Shellac in California

Not quite a duplicate of What are the best substitutes when nothing labelled as "Denatured alcohol" can be found in your area?
For my sins, I live in California. California has completely banned Denatured Alcohol, and you can't have it shipped here (so no Amazon or Rockler etc). Nor can you buy Everclear at more than 60%. Isopropyl Alcohol hasn't been seen in the stores since March 2020.
I need to either dissolve shellac flakes, or thin Zinsser premade shellac. Every website I visit just naturally assumes meths/denatured alcohol is available.
What can I use as a solvent in this state? And where can I get it?

A:

Bioethanol is an option.  It's effectively high-proof Everclear with a bitterant to prevent it from being ingested.
You might have luck finding it stocked at outdoor outfitters (camping/hiking stores), or stores that supply wood stoves which sometimes use it as a fuel in ventless stoves.
A couple examples are Crown "Fuel for Alcohol Stoves", which REI appears to carry, and Moda Fireplace Fuel which appears to be sold through retailers like Home Depot, Ralphs, and Walmart (perhaps online only).
You might also try contacting local distilleries, if there are any, to see if they sell their heads & tails.  Sometimes they are available for use as cleaning agents
