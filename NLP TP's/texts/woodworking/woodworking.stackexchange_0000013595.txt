Q:

How is this weight rack joined or fastened?

I'm trying to recreate the weight rack shown in this photo and I'm curious how top A-frame like section and the section where the bottom of the 'A' meets the base are joined/fastened.

A:

Looking at the full size image, the top of the frame is a simple butt joint. The left-hand upright dies into the right-hand upright which continues past it to form the point.
I don't see any sign of screws or dowels going through the right-hand upright or any sign of filler over a screw hole. I also don't see any sign of screw holes (filled or otherwise) on the inside of the joint in the left-hand upright.
That leaves only some form of hidden joinery:

Mortise & Tenon - with the mortise on the right-hand upright and the tenon on the left hand
Dowels - holes in both uprights with dowels inserted into the holes
Biscuits - a couple of slots cut into the uprights with biscuits inserted to reinforce the joint
Glue - nothing but glue and faith holding it together. Glue is strong, but I'm not sure I'd rely on nothing but glue to support this kind of weight and abuse

My guess would be doweled joints. They're reasonably easy and even easier if you have an alignment guide.
The bottom joints could all be glued & screwed with the screws going up from the bottom to hide the heads.
