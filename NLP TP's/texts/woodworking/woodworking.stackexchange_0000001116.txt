Q:

How can I safely move complete 4 ft x 8 ft sheets of plywood alone?

I saw this photo of a lounger made out of plywood, and I am pretty certain it would be easy to execute with a jigsaw, sandpaper and patience, but one thing I've never tried is to bring an entire sheet of 4 ft x 8 ft plywood home. I usually buy smaller project boards.
Assuming that I don't have any other warm bodies to help move a whole sheet of plywood, what is the best way to lug a full sheet into a workshop, assuming there is enough clearance to get a full sheet in the door in the first place?

A:

I use a Stanley Panel Carry (Model 93-300).  It is about $7.00 on Amazon or at Home Depot.
For cutting panels, the best way is to get a sheet of foam insulation, and lay it on the ground and put the panel on top of it.  Cut through the panel into the foam.

There are commercial handles that are supposed to make carrying plywood easier, but they're not inexpensive. 
The simplest way I've carried sheet goods is with a loop of rope caught on the corners.

A:

There are panel carriers which range from inexpensive at less than $10 to rather pricey at around $50. You can also use the rope loop method as suggested by TX Turner.
Personally, I try to avoid lifting 4'x8' sheets thicker than 1/2" by myself. Instead I slide or drag them onto the cart at the store, then slide or drag them onto the car's luggage rack (or into the pickup truck bed or trailer).
Once I'm home, I again slide them off the car/truck/trailer and onto a furniture dolly or 3-wheeled mover's dolly to move them around easily.
