Q:

Why offset biscuits

I was reading "Illustrated Cabinetmaking" and came across this: "Where a horizontal board tops an upright, the biscuits should be offset".  It does not explain why.  Does anyone know?
The next sentence says:  "Likewise, biscuits used in joining a shelf to an upright should be located below center to increase the shelf's resistance to toploading".  Does anyone know what toploading is?
Here's the illustration in the book for both of the above:

A:

I have never encountered any rules of thumb about using biscuits, but the diagram makes sense. In the top connection the biscuit will transfer stress resulting from any side to side movement of the cabinet.  All that stress is resisted by the small width of the remaining shelf between the biscuit and the outside edge to the left of it. The more wood there the better. Similarly, any weight placed on the lower shelf can only be resisted by the shelf wood above the biscuit.
of course, both connection details could be improved by creating a rabbet joint at the top and inserting the lower shelf into a dado in the vertical member.  In this way the entire thickness of the board is being used to address the stresses.
