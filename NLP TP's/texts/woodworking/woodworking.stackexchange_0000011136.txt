Q:

Using a 5/8 dado stack on a "30mm" arbor

Background
I would like to buy a dado stack, but 30mm is hard to come buy due to laws forbidding selling them in Europe. Using them for personal use is ok, so I can order from abroad.
Question
I have a Dewalt DW7492 table saw with a "30mm" arbor, but it is 14mm (9/16") wide and 30mm (1") long. It uses a flange washer that centers the 30mm ID blade on the shaft.

I suspect this is the same arbor as North American models with a different flange.
Can anyone support this theory? Is there anything I should be weary of trying to do this?
Update about the law
This law appears to have gone in effect in 2012. You can find links to the EU  directive here, which is defined in Article 12.3 based on this ISO standard.

A:

I decided to go out on a limb and buy a stack to know for sure, and...
It fits! There is a verry small amount of play before tightened, but any less and the blades would scrape over the arbor. I believe this is a proper 5/8" arbor.
I do not know about other manufacturer's arbor dimensions, but if you have a DeWalt, you may be in luck.
If you are interested in dados and buying a contractor saw in Europe,  in addition to the arbor diameter the DWSE942 also has a long enough arbor to support the full blade/chipper stack with some (not all) of the spacers provided in the Freud 6" Pro Dado Set.
