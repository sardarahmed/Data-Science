Q:

What is the function of the collagen fibres in the vitreous body of the human eye?

The vitreous body of the human eye consists of mostly water, but there is also a small percentage of collagen fibres. 
What is the function of these fibers?

A:

Collagens are a family of fibrous proteins (as opposed to globular proteins like enzymes and hormones and membrane proteins like cell receptors) that form part of connective tissue. Thus they are important in forming the structure of many organs and tissues.
Connective tissue is one of the four main types of animal tissue. The others are epithelial tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue.

In the eye, connective tissue is responsible for much of the structure of the organ. 
The vitreous is a fluid-like gel contained in the posterior chamber of the eye, between the lens and retina.
According to this paper:

The vitreous is the fluid-like gel, composed of approximately 98â€“99% water with trace amounts of hyaluronic acid, glucose, anions, cations, ions, and collagen, located in the posterior chambers of the eyes.

According to this paper:

Collagens are important macromolecules that contribute to vitreoretinal adhesion at the vitreoretinal interface.

So the vitreous is a type of connective tissue, just one that has a greater proportion of water than most. As such, it contains proteins like collagens and hyaluronic acid which contribute to its viscosity.
Collagens are also important for vitreoretinal attachment (between the vitreous and the retina at the back of the eye). Thus some of the collagen found in the vitreous may originate at the retina.
