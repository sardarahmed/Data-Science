Q:

Will getting a vaccine have any additional effect on your immune system if you already got covid-19?

Supposedly people who got covid-19 get immunity after it. According to this article,
More SARS-COV-2 reinfections reported but still a rare event citing several studies,

Bertollini and his colleagues conclude in their report that “the risk
for documented reinfection was very rare at about 1-2 reinfections per
10,000 infected persons.” The researchers further note that the
“findings suggest that most infected persons do develop immunity
against reinfection that lasts for at least [a] few months, and that
reinfections (if they occur) are well tolerated and no more
symptomatic than primary infections

Are there any reasons for people to get vaccinated?
Will getting a vaccine have any additional effect on your immune system if you already got covid-19?

A:

I've found an answer to this,

If I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get
vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine?
Yes. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the
fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, vaccine should be
offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19
infection. CDC is providing recommendations to federal, state, and
local governments about who should be vaccinated first.
At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from
getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. The immunity
someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity,
varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests natural
immunity may not last very long.
We won’t know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we
have more data on how well the vaccines work.
Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important
aspects of COVID-19 that experts are trying to learn more about, and
CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
