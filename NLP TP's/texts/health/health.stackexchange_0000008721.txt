Q:

Does a hot bath effect fertility in men?

I was taught that a man's testes are outside his body because sperm can't handle inside-body temperature. 
I was thinking there are other times where a man's testes heat up. Like in a bath or spa or sauna. So my question is, can something like a hot bath or a day at the spa decrease a man's fertility?

Elevated temperatures are thought to decrease sperm counts in males. 

Mayoclinic.org

Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function. Although
  studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or
  hot tubs may temporarily impair your sperm count.
Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a
  laptop computer for long stretches of time also may increase the
  temperature in your scrotum and may slightly reduce sperm production.

Keep your scrotum cool, because heat slows down the making of sperm.
  To do this, avoid hot baths, wear boxers instead of briefs, and try
  not to wear tight pants.

Researchers have found that the reason why a man's testicles rest
  outside the body in the scrotum rather than in the abdomen like the
  ovaries is because the ideal temperature for sperm production is three
  to four degrees below normal body temperature. Any warmer will affect
  sperm count, slashing it by about 40 percent per one-degree rise.
  Temporary overheating of the testicles can result from exposure to
  things such as saunas, hot tubs, heating blankets, even waterbeds.

So opinions vary on the accountability of research, but are consistent with heat having a possible risk.
