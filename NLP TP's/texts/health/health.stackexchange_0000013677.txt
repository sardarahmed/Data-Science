Q:

Which criteria should one look at when purchasing an electric toothbrush?

Which criteria should one look at when purchasing an electric toothbrush (from a medical perspective, i.e. ignoring non-medical criteria such as price, battery, life expectancy or warranty), and what's at the optimal value for each of these criteria?
Some ideas of criteria:

number of brush strokes per minute
vibration mode
shape of the brush (see below for some examples)

If the question is too broad,  I don't mind asking about each criterion in separate questions (though I might not be aware of all the criteria).

Examples of shapes of the brush:
