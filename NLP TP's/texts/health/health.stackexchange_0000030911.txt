Q:

Where can I find a list of MRI scanners ordered by the quality of the images they take?

I'd like to have a list of MRI scanners ordered by the quality of the images they take. The number of teslas is one parameter, but among MRI scanners with the same number it teslas, I'm told the image quality quality varies a lot between different MRI scanners. For example, I was told by several radiologists that the recently released GE Sina Premier MRI scanner had better image quality than the GE Discovery MRI scanner. If that depends on which type of tissue is being analyzed, I'm mostly interested in tendons.
I searched on Google and Google Scholar but couldn't find any information on it yet beyond what I wrote in my answer.

A:

Evelio Gonz√°lez Dalmau mentions on https://www.researchgate.net/post/MRI_MRS_users_what_is_your_opinion_the_best_machine_3T:

the website: http://www.magnet-mri.org/. In a quantitative assessment is made of the parameters and characteristics of MRI machines.

Unfortunately the website is discontinued and the latest snapshot I could find on the wayback machine dates back from September 28th 2015:

As of the 1st of April 2009 MagNET will no longer be funded by the Centre for Evidence based Purchasing (CEP) to perform evaluations of MRI scanners and applications.

The last message in the Research Gate  discussion dates back from 30th Jul, 2014.
