Q:

Why can't I gain more weight?

I had a bad eating disorder for a long time. This had a bad effect on my health and I became very skinny. Now, I am eating health again but still can't gain anymore weight. I am 47kg with a height of 5.6 feet, male. Am I underweight?

A:

Am I underweight? Yes
Yes, your BMI is 16.7 and so you are classified as underweight. Healthy weight range for your height: 52kg - 70.5kg (based on your age being 30).
The calculation for you bmi was done using this calculator:  http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/Healthyweightcalculator.aspx
Why can't I gain more weight?
It's impossible to say without a full breakdown of your diet and medical history. At that point any answer is attempting diagnosis for your specific case.
Note: I personally would recommend you get a calorie tracking app or write down the calories and shoot for about 2500-3000 (healthy, balanced) calories per day, paired with a reasonable (3-5 days a week) exercise regime of:

cardiovascular activity (running/rowing/biking/etc.)
weight lifting (squat/deadlift/bench/etc.)
