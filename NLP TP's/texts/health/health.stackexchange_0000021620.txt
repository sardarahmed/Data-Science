Q:

Why Aren't There Any OpenSource/OpenHardware Ventilators?

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ventilators are in short supply. As an engineer, I am interested in learning the risks/challenges of designing an OpenSource ventilator. And how it could be tested for proper functionality.
Medical equipment has to rise to the highest standards, especially when it is required to work flawlessly in an emergency situation.
Are there existing OpenSource ventilators projects? What requirements would a OpenSource ventilator have to fullfil?

A:

In the United States, any ventilator must fulfill:

Safety and 
Efficacy 

requirements as set forth in Medical Device Standards.  
Sales of medical devices are regulated by the FDA: a lengthy (data intensive) and paperwork intensive process.  FDA ventilator specific guidance within the context of COVID respirator demand  
I would suggest that you identify testable system requirements.  The quickest way to learn is to operate an existing device: if you have access to a healthcare professional (Anesthesiologist or Respiratory Therapist), he / she would be the best functional resource.  A good starting point (do your homework before talking to anyone) is this functional explanation on youTube. 
Challenges for hacking a ventilator for the COVID crisis comprises:

A design where parts (Bill of Materials) are readily available (100K to 1M devices needed)
A testbed to demonstrate Safety and Efficacy testing + any required regulatory approval
Skilled labor to manufacture assemble and test 

UPDATE
April 8 2020: Medtronic is sharing its portable ventilator design specifications and code for free to all   That being said, a 510K and all the document would be required by the FDA ensure requirements discussed above are met.
