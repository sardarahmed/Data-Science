Q:

When is angiography needed in stable angina patients?

Under which conditions is angiography needed in patients who have 'stable angina')? In other words, what are the 'indications' of angiography in such patients? The angiography is done with a view to perform revascularization with angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).

Briefly, medication are the first line treatment for stable angina. 
Angiography and revascularization (angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery) are needed only for patients whose angina is resulting in a moderate to severe limitation of daily activities despite adequate medication. 
For patients with mild symptoms, a stress test (such as stress MIBI scan) should be performed and angiography + revascularization may be helpful if > 10% of myocardium (heart muscle) is showing signs of ischemia. 
Persons whose angina is controlled on medication as well as persons who have a negative stress test are not at high risk of heart attacks and death and hence do not need angiography and revascularization.
