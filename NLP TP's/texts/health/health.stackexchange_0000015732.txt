Q:

Impact of time between salad preparation and consumption

Will a salad made with cut spinach, grated beetroot and carrot, mixed with curd/yogurt, kept in refrigerator retain it's nutrients 1 hour after the preparation?
Only thing I know that upon cutting iron in the vegetables starts oxidising and vegetables look dark in colour, but I can't make out the difference in colour.
Thanks.

A:

Cutting and storing vegetables for an hour in the refrigerator would likely have only a negligible effect on their nutrient content. There could be a considerable change in the look and taste, though. 
Quality Changes and Nutrient Retention in Fresh-Cut versus Whole Fruits during Storage, 2006 (Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry)

Fresh-cut pineapples, mangoes, cantaloupes, watermelons, strawberries,
  and kiwifruits and whole fruits were stored for up to 9 days in
  air at 5 Â°C.
Contrary to expectations, it was clear that minimal processing had
  almost no effect on the main antioxidant [vitamins A, C and E, and
  polyphenols] constituents.
