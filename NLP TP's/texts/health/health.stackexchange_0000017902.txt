Q:

Is there scientific evidence that spacing out vaccines have any positive effects?

There are parents and doctors that agree to spread out their kids' shots. Supposedly it's easier on the baby (some babies experience fever or other ill reactions to vaccination). 
But I had a thought that maybe the fever after a certain shot might be the same regardless if it's taken together with another shot or not. Or maybe the ill effect even increases as the break between shots gets reduced and there is less time for body to recover for the next shots?
Is there any evidence that taking shots one by one reduces the ill effects?

A:

There is evidence that delaying or refusing immunization puts children at risk of disease here and here. There is also evidence that delaying or spreading out MMR or MMRV in particular puts children at greater risk of reactions (febrile seizures), rather then reducing the risk. I'm not aware of any study demonstrating the opposite.
