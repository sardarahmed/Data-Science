Q:

In which version of the ICD was homosexuality classified as a disease?

In Wikipedia article it is said, that in ICD-9 homosexuality was listed as a disease and that it was removed from there in ICD-10.
From third party sources, I knew, that homosexuality was listed under number 302.0 in ICD-9. 
Unfortunately in ICD-9 service I see Ego-dystonic sexual orientation under this number.
This means person knows his orientation and wishes to change it.
But this is not what "homosexuality" means (sexual affection directed to same-sex partners).
So, the question is: was homosexuality itself ever classified as a disease and when it was?

A:

I should look at the actions of American Psychiatric Assocation (APA) (1).

Although American homosexuals today are still struggling for equal
  rights, no shift has been more drastically beneficial for the status
  of homosexuality than its declassification as a mental illness. The
  American Psychiatric Association’s Board of Trustees passed this
  groundbreaking decision unanimously on December 15, 1973, and
  subsequently released  a statement that rejected legal discrimination
  on the basis of sexual  orientation. In the publication of its
  monumental decision to remove  homosexuality from the Diagnostic and
  Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders (DSM), the board cited “review
  of evidence[,]...changing  social norms and growing gay-rights
  activism.”

And indeed, Medicine has a dark history when homosexuality was regarded as mental illness. 
Classification of diseases as adopted by the Massachusetts General Hospital (1919)

In the military medicine in the year 1949 homosexuality was classified under "psychopathy".

A "modern" perspective in 1968 was to consider pedophilia as a subtype of homosexuality.

Another "modern" perspective in 1971 considered LSD as a "treatment" for homosexuality.
 
So, yes, things were slightly different back in the days.
