Q:

Can HIV patients get further infected by their own blood?

A person without HIV can get infected with HIV by, blood already infected with the virus entering into their body (for example).
Can HIV patients get further infected by the for example ingestion of their own blood or even by inserting their own blood again into their own bodies?

A:

No.
One is either infected or one isn't. There is no middle ground. Infection is defined as

invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissues, as in an infectious disease.

Also, biologically speaking, there aren't even viruses added because they remove them from their organism first (draw blood) and then re-insert them
