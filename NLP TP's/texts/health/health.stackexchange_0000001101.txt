Q:

Reversing sleep cycle

I have been a nocturnal for some period of time and thus altering the sleep cycle seems difficult i.e. moving back to the normal 10 to 5 sleep cycle. 
What can be done to revert back to the normal sleep cycle? Should I need to skip a day of sleep or you recommend any health hack?

A:

There are quite a few things you can do to "reset" your sleep schedule, as shown by this WebMD article. However, be aware that due to your own circadian rhythms, that may not be the optimal pattern for you. Some of the suggestions include:

Bright lights - Use bright lights around you when you first get up.
Dim lights - Conversely, use dim lights in the evening.
Don't lay awake - If you tend to lay awake for a while, do something else before you go to bed.
Time meals - Use your meal times to help your body adapt to when to sleep. If you eat at irregular times, it can throw off your body.
Limit caffeine intake (Especially later in the day)

There are a few other suggestions in the article, especially relating to travel. One of the other suggestions is supplementing with melatonin, but as can be seen by this study review, many of the studies are not very well done, and a few directly refute melatonin being a sleep aid.
If you have trouble adjusting to a more traditional sleep schedule, you may want to look at biphasic sleeping (2, 4 hour sleep shifts) or contact a sleep center for help.
