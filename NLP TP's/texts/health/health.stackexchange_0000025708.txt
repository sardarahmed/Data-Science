Q:

What are the most common ways that COVID kills?

Looking at the death counts for 2020 published on the CDC's website, total deaths "involving COVID-19" were 375,581, but total deaths "involving COVID-19 and pneumonia" were only 175,653.
So if less than half of all COVID deaths were caused by pneumonia, what were the rest caused by?

A:

On the same CDC website, there is a section titled:

COVID-19 Mortality Overview

A link on this page (last but one) leads to a detailed analysis of comorbidalities:

Most Frequently Listed Comorbidities with COVID-19 Deaths

and also adds that as of 2nd Feb 2021, deaths involving:

Influenza/Pneumonia (44%)
Hypertension (20%)
Diabetes (16%)
Dementias (15%)
Sepsis (9%)

i.e. the patients already had these illnesses before catching COVID-19, and later died.
