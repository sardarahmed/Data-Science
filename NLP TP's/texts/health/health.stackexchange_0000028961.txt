Q:

Could someone survive being in a diabetic coma for several hours?

I’m writing a modern-day thriller, probably set in Colorado or another heavily forested portion of America. A surveyor from Japan has brought his two children on a working holiday, and they’re at a semi-abandoned construction site.
After some playing around, the children realise their parent is missing - and when they find him, he’s in a diabetic coma (due to hypoglycemia).
I propose that this is caused by a malfunctioning insulin pump (possibly a twisted catheter), resulting in a failure to deliver sufficient insulin and a dangerous level of glucose in the blood (as per this web page).
Due to the mountainous terrain, cell phones are useless. Over the next hour or so, the children attempt (while dealing with additional adversity) to call in medical attention.
Does this seem reasonable? A diagnosed diabetic falling into an unresponsive coma, surviving for a few hours, then being revived through later (~2 hours later?) medical attention?
Thank you in advance...!

A:

Your scenario is easy to work out. The character injects his usual dose of insulin prior to a meal he's about to eat, but he gets interrupted by something and never finishes the meal. End result: hypoglycemia sufficient to render him unresponsive. When he's found, those finding him are educated enough to know they can't pour anything down his throat while he's unresponsive, so they lodge hard candies between his cheek and gums and wait for them to dissolve and give him the sugar he needs.
A more nuanced treatment of the question can be found here:

Give sugar until the responsive patient regains an adequate level of
responsiveness. If the patient is unresponsive, place the patient on
their side and rub sugar into their gums with a gloved finger. Make
sure to protect the patient’s airway.
