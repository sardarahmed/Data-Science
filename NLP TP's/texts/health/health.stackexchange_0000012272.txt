Why has the number of medication errors increased by 463% between 2010 and 2016 in the US?

A:

The USA Today article you linked to provides two potential explanations:

The FDA said the spike is because of improvements made to its reporting system over the last two years. Pharmacy industry experts believe the numbers also reflect more people are filling more prescriptions than ever.

The first explanation seems quite plausible, as it's unlikely that the error rate would increase organically that fast in six years.
