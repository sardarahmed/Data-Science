Q:

Why has the African region not seen many Covid-19 cases so far?

According to the World Health Organization's situation report for March 12th, the African region has only recorded 51 cases of the Covid-19 virus, and only one of these cases has been fatal. The disease has so far only been recorded in 9 of the 54 African countries, with only three of these countries reporting more than a couple of cases.
Given the wider spread of the disease in practically every other region, and that the African population is around 1.3 billion, this appears to be a clear anomaly.
What reasons are there for this apparent inconsistency with expectations?

A:

Health care in many sub-Saharan African countries is extremely sparse. As an example, Sierra Leone has less than 250 doctors for the entire country.
As a result, it is likely that cases in that and similar countries are grossly under-reported.
