Q:

Why aren't other vaccines combined (like the MMR)?

From Public Health England:

With single vaccines, children would need 6 separate injections:

3 primary doses - 1 measles, 1 mumps, 1 rubella

3 pre-school boosters

Each injection can be uncomfortable and the act of immunisation is sometimes distressing for children.
Single vaccines are less safe than MMR because they leave children vulnerable to dangerous diseases for longer. Giving 3 separate doses at spaced out intervals would mean that, after the first injection, the child still has no immunity to the other 2 diseases.

Given the benefits of combining the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines into a single MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, why don't we see similar packaging more often? Why aren't other vaccines similarly combined?

A:

I work in a pediatric office, and we regularly administer combination vaccines to our patients. (Such as Pediarix, Pentacel, ProQuad, etc.) You can check out table 2 in this link to see all CDC approved combo vaccines in the U.S.
On a side note, the CDC does not even consider MMR (or DTaP for that matter as well) to be a combo shot as it is hard to find a vaccine for each individual component of those vaccines. (Source)
