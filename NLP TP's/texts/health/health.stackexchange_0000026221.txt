Q:

Antibody test after vaccination with BBIBP-CorV

After vaccination with BBIBP-CorV (inactivated) which of the following tests can be taken to determine if the vaccine produced an immune response:

IgM for N protein
IgG for N protein
IgG for S protein

Sorry if it's obvious, but I'm not an expert and cannot find a clear answer after googling for an hour.
My current understanding that it's test 2 - IgG for N protein for inactivated vaccines.

A:

TL;DR;
3 - IgG for S protein
From Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial:

The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, assessed as the neutralising
antibody responses against infectious SARS-CoV-2.

From What are COVID-19 neutralising antibody rapid tests and why use them?

Neutralising antibodies bind to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and
interfere with the virusâ€™ ability to enter human cells. IgG antibodies
are the most common antibody in blood and have the largest part to
play in conferring immunity to bacteria or viruses.
