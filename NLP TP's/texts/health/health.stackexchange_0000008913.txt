Q:

Heart size growth after heart transplant in children?

I am wondering if they perform a heart transplant to a kid around 10 years, do the heart size increases over the years?  

A:

Pediatric heart transplantation represents approximatively 15% of the total heart transplantations 1.
Several studies have provided some insights on the cardiac growth after heart transplantation. Most of them have shown that the transplanted heart in children follows  similar growth as non-transplanted paediatric hearts.
Here some extracts of the major studies in that field:

In a study including 13 infants with a duration of follow-up was
3.1±0.4 years

Both right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) chamber
  dimensions were within the normal range at both early and late time
  points and grew normally

Another study reported normal cardiac growth after    transplantation
although these patients showed somatic growth    deficits due to the
immunosuppresive therapy.

Finally, one large study which included 147 patients and followed them up during several years (up to 10 years) reported similar
results

The ventricular end-diastolic diameters, the ventricular end-diastolic
  volumes and ventricular mass increased proportionally 6 to 10 years
  after heart transplantation in all patients regardless of the BSA
  ratio.
