How do you know if you're pregnant while on birth control?

How do you know if you're pregnant while taking take birth control? Also, is it possible to feel the symptoms of pregnancy after having sex earlier in the day?

A:

You know by getting a pregnancy test. It can be a home test you buy in a pharmacy or you can visit a doctor or clinic. 
No, it is not possible to feel symptoms of pregnancy mere hours after sex. It takes a week or two for the first signs to appear. A missed period is usually the first detectable sign.
