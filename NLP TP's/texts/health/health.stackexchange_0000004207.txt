Q:

Were earwigs historically used as a medication?

I have read that people used to use powdered earwig as a cure for ear infections. Is this claim true? What are the details of this practice?

A:

The term "earwig" comes from people thinking that the animal crawled (and wiggled) into people's ears. It doesn't. So this has nothing to do with using it as medication against ear infections etc.  
(In German, by the way, it's called Ohrenkneifer (ear pincher))
