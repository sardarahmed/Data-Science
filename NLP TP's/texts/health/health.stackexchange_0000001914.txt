Q:

Treatment for mild Tourette syndrome

I have a friend who has had Tourette syndrome since he was a child. He is 26 now, the Tourette is mild, involving shoulder twitching. 
Is there any treatment that bring the syndrome to a negligible/manageable level without taking any medication? 

A:

Current treatments for Tourette syndrome (drugs like dopamine receptor antagonists, which are the reference treatment, excepted) include:

Psychotherapy/behaviour therapy/habit training
Deep brain stimulation (for severe cases, so not really applicable here)
Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Biofeedback
