Q:

Naturally dissolving kidney stone through daily activities, food and drinking habits

To give you a brief introduction, while writing this post I was in a hospital bed and treated for getting rid of ~20mm of a kidney stone on my left side. The doctors followed the PCNL procedure. 
Now, doctors informed me about another 5mm of stone on right kidney.  
A quick look around the internet to find a solution to getting the stone out of my system with a natural process, many suggest:

Drink loads of water
Drink beer
Take Apple cider vinegar
Olive oil and lemon juice therapy
Or, have another operation

Do natural remedies help for kidney stones?

A:

The one thing I would add to your natural remedy is cranberry juice and/or dried cranberries. Countless studies have shown a correlation between cranberry consumption and renal health.
I know for a fact cranberry consumption can help prevent kidney stones. I'm not sure about dissolving them, but it certainly won't hurt to add to your remedy list.
