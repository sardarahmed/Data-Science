Q:

Is it safe to eat raw flour in Europe?

A few years back the FDA said that you shouldn't eat raw flour (for example in color dough). Is that also true in the EU which has (AFAIK) better food standards?

A:

The FDA's guidance on raw flour comes after an E. coli outbreak was traced to raw flour.
Other outbreaks have been noticed since, in the US and Canada.
The UK has the same guidance to not eat raw flour.
I did not find evidence of a similar outbreak in Europe, but flour in Germany tested positive for Shiga-producing E. coli as well. Given that these outbreaks are fairly sporadic and that low-level contamination of raw flour with E. coli seems common, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that any food standards differences caused the outbreaks to occur in the US and Canada rather than Europe.
