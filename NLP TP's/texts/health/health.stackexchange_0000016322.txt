Q:

Abnormal thyroid function and obesity - known links?

In conversations regarding the increasing number of people that are obese (in an American or European context), often times claims regarding thyroid function being a significant contributor to these developments come up. I've tried finding sources written by medical experts addressing a lay audience to clarify these issues, but I can't find anything that makes the issue clear enough for me.
Question(s): 

Is there a known causal relationship that goes "abnormal thyroid function -> higher weight"? I don't know whether thyroid issues develop later in life or are congenital, or how much of an impact they have, so this question might be ill-phrased.
If abnormal thyroid function is known to have effects on weight gain, can we quantify how many people are affected by this, and how much weight gain per person is caused by this?
Are there thyroid conditions that make it extremely difficult not to put on weight (say, you continue to put on weight despite eating less than 1000 calories a day), and if so, do we know how many people are affected by those conditions?

A:

The relationship between thyroid function and body weight is bidirectional and complex. 
It is known for decades, if not centuries, that cretinism (only in the end of the 19th century to be associated to hypothyroidism) may be accompanied by weight gain and that thyrotoxicosis may result in weight loss. As early as in 1835 Robert J. Graves described that ladies affected by goitre and palpitations (probably due to hyperthyroidism resulting from the disease which is now named after him) were remarkably thin [2]. Five years later the German physician Karl von Basedow described the same condition, where a lady suffering from goitre, Exophthalmos and palpitations had severely emaciated [3]. In 1883 the swiss surgeon Theodor Kocher described weight gain after total thyroidectomy [4]. Ten years later, in 1893 William Ord described rapid weight loss, after myxoedematous patients were set on treatment with thyroid extreact [5].
Today it is known that over one third of hypothyroid infants have a birth weight greater than the ninetieth percentile [6, 7]. However, an “atypical” form of hypothyroidism may be associated to low birth weight [8]. Of course, weight gain in hypothyroidism isn’t restricted to infants, but common in adults, too. Hypothyroidism is assumed to contribute 2.5 to 5 kg (5 to 10 pounds) to body weight [9]. 
On the other hand, changes in body weight may also result in changes of thyroid function. A number of studies, as recently extensively reviewed [10, 11], described elevated TSH levels and increased total step-up deiodinase activity in patients with weight gain. These changes were reversible after weight loss [12]. On the other hand, low T3 syndrome is a well-known consequence of anorexia and starvation [13, 14].
Probably, these changes represent adaptive responses of pituitary-thyroid axis to type 1 or type 2 allostasis, respectively [15]. The observed mechanisms may contribute to some kind of autoregulation of weight in conditions of changing supply with energy.

To use thyroid hormones as an adjunct treatment in obesity is strongly discouraged, since cardiovascular side effects may be significant [16].
