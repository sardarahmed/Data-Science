Q:

Do vertical mice cause less stress on the hand, wrist and arm than traditional mice?

Vertical mice are often marketed as more ergonomics than traditional mice. Is that true? I am especially interested in stress on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.
Example of such claim, from https://evoluent.com/:

A:

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is numbness, tingling, weakness, and other problems in your hand because of pressure on a nerve (median
  nerve) going through your wrist. {1}

Pressure or swelling of the median nerve causes CTS and making the same hand movements over and over may induce swelling. The swelling can get even worse if the wrist is bent down (your hands lower than your wrists) or by making the same wrist movements repeatedly.
The ergonomic mouse serves to prevent people from holding their mice on the edge of their desks or other surface, which naturally rests in a manner that bends the wrist. The person has to keep their wrist straight in order to use the mouse, thus reducing swelling over time.
It can be annoying to adjust to an ergonomic keyboard or mouse, but they help keep the wrists straight, which can be a problem for anyone sitting all day at a computer.
Given what an ergonomic mouse and keyboard are supposed to do, there is little or no data to support the concept that activity adjustment prevents carpal tunnel syndrome. The study cited below has results that are inconsistent and non-conclusive. The researchers even state in their conclusion:

Speculative causal theories should be analyzed through a rigorous
  approach prior to wide adoption.
