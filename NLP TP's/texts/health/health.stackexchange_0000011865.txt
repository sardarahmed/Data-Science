Which is the best injection  after dog bite in india
In India, is Rabipur the preferred injection?

A:

It is one of several brands of rabies vaccine available in India. A list can be found here. It wouldn't be appropriate for anyone allergic to eggs since it is cultured in eggs. Otherwise, it should be perfectly fine and is on the lower end of the cost scale. 
Probably only a pharmaceuticals distributor in India could say whether it's the "preferred" brand, but it is a major brand from a reputable manufacturer. It should be completely adequate to protect the patient.
