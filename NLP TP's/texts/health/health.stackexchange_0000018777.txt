Q:

Could an old person get arthritis in only one knuckle?

Is Arthritis in one knuckle and no where else, possible for an elderly person ( 75 years or older)?  Or maybe the question should be is it likely ?   

A:

Monoarticular arthritis, or inflammation of a single joint, is a not uncommon complaint. Common causes in an older patient include gout, pseudogout, trauma, and infection. Gonococcal arthritis is a particularly common cause when monoarticular arthritis is seen in a younger patient.
