Q:

How does coffee affect blood sugar levels?

My girlfriend has a question:
Trying to figure out (on my own) if I have a problem with my blood sugar. To that effect I have just bought a home testing kit to run post-meal sugar test (like they would in a clinic).
Just wondering if coffee affects my blood sugar as I'd like to drink it with my 70 grams carbs for the test.
I have a recurrent yeast infection, which is why I'm doing this testing. However I know that I don't have the following: HIV, leukemia which leaves diabetes as the only other usual cause.

A:

As a type 1 diabetic I have noticed even black coffee can have an effect on blood sugar. Coffee( the caffeine really) increases your blood epinephrine (adrenaline) levels. Adrenaline has the same effect as glucagon .They stimulate the breakdown of glycogen into glucose
