Q:

What are survival rates of male patients in stage IV throat cancer that has metastasised to the lower pallet?

The patient is receiving a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The surgery to remove the cancerous throat tissue was not entirely successful as the surgeon discovered that the cancer had metastasised to the lower pallet.  The patient is male, in his early 60s, very athletic and fit, in excellent health with great cardiovascular capacity, etc.

A:

Roughly speaking, it appears that about 30-40% of patients in stage IV will survive for 5 years or more depending on where the cancer originated. This reference provides details.
