Q:

What foods can increase penis length and girth?

Are there any foods that can naturally increase the length and girth of my penis?
Some food I can think about are:

Milk 
Steak
Eggs
Basil 
Broccoli 

I'm not looking for like 5 extra inches, just maybe 1 more inch would be fantastic.

A:

After full sexual development is complete (usually the teens for most males), penis enlargement is impossible. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar and is probably trying to sell you something.

"I think there isn't a guy in the world who hasn't wished his penis
  were an inch or two longer," says Michael O'Leary, MD, professor of
  urologic surgery at Harvard Medical School and a urologist at Brigham
  and Women's Hospital in Boston.
However, after more than a century of generally dubious and sometimes
  lunatic penis enlargement attempts, there's still not much you can do.
  Sure, there are lots and lots of supposed options out there -- penis
  pills, creams, brutal stretching exercises, horrific-looking devices,
  and penis surgery. Almost none of it works. The few approaches that
  can work often have modest benefits and serious side effects. How
  serious? In some cases, erectile dysfunction-serious.
"Trust me, if I knew of a way to safely and effectively increase penis
  size, I'd be a billionaire," O'Leary tells WebMD. "But I don't. Nobody
  does."
