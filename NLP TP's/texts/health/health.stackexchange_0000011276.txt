Q:

Lipid test interval

What is a reasonable amount of time to wait to determine the effect of introducing a change in lipid medication (statins \ fenofibrate).  
For example, if on January 1 one measures Triglycerides and Cholesterol are high (beyond reference range) and fenfibrate is introduced: how many days should the medication be used before re-testing to measure efficacy?  
If you have experience with managing your Triglyscerides \ Cholesterol please state this in your response and along with any lessons-learned: thank you.

A:

I am not clear as to how soon an intervention results in changes but in some trials people have tested within 2 weeks.
I typically retest people at three weeks to provide reinforcement for a dietary intervention.
