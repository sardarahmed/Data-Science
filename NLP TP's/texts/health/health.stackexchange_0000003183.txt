Q:

How to fight beard loss without cortisol injections?

I guess losing beard area as a little blocks is a really bad situation. I asked this issue to a dermatology doctor, she said "Run away from stress". Running away from stress is definitely impossible today's world. 
The doctor said: "I can inject cortisol liquid into the skin". Maybe acceptable, but however the lose may keep going, though. After injections, the skin is going down and begin to lose its elasticity, and got old. So, cortisol is harmful for skin even though it was a bit good choice. (Cortisol has made some weight on a skin and body)
Trying garlics with salt on a skin is offered among people near you, but the skin got red, and burned, and didn't fix.
How can we stop the loss of beard?
Edit: (01.02.2015) A different doctor said: "This is Alopecia Areata. If cortisol didn't care, Tacrolimus Monohidrat Pomad Creams may be a good choice to care", and  "The skin is begun to get repaired itself within 2 months if the cream is used twice a day"
