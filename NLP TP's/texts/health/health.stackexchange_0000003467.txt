Q:

Can quitting smoking cause stomach problems?

Say a person quits smoking (cold turkey), can it cause frequent bowel movements like 3-4 times a day and this frequent bowel movement lasting for month or more maybe. And because of frequent bowel movement sometimes there can be blood in stool.
Can quitting smoking has these effects?

A:

No one can prove that quitting smoking doesn't cause frequent bowel movements in a particular individual, but it's not a symptom generally associated with quitting smoking. The usual symptoms are:

Nicotine cravings.
Anger, frustration, and irritability.
Anxiety.
Depression.
Weight gain.

As a former smoker, I would add increased appetite and difficulty sleeping to that list. But as you can see, nothing in the list even hints at gastrointestinal disturbances or changes in bowel habits.
But most important is your mention of blood in the stool. Frequent bowel movements in and of themselves don't cause blood in the stool, nor does quitting smoking. Bleeding somewhere within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is what causes blood in the stool.
The possible reasons for blood in the stool are numerous:

benign and malignant tumors; inflammation such as infectious colitis
  or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); ulcers such as peptic ulcers;
  esophagitis; or a traumatic tear such as may occur in the anus
  (fissure) or the lower end of the esophagus.

The article quoted above goes on to say:

Intestinal bleeding is potentially serious and demands investigation â€“
  often as an emergency.

Trying to guess what the cause is on an internet forum is impossible since even doctors with intimate access to the patient often have difficulty diagnosing the cause of bloody stools. However, seeing a doctor about the frequent bowel movements and especially the bloody stools is exactly what the person needs to do, and the sooner, the better.
