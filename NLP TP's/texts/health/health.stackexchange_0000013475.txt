Q:

Walking as a healthy habit for the aged and my doctor's thoughts on it

Nowadays, many doctors recommend old people, who cannot do gym or such huge physical fitness exercises, to walk, as walking is considered and a clinically proven very good way to keep good health for the aged people.
Our doctor prescribes the same, but he is a bit different. According to him, walking only in the morning helps keeping good health. Walking in the evening has no good effect on the health of the person.
My question is, walking is a good physical exercise, but how does it matter if I walk in the morning or evening? Can anyone give a proper scientific explanation for what the doctor says? I cannot seem to find any, and neither can the doctor tell me anything satisfactory.

A:

I'm a physical therapist (PT) - considering we specialize in the application of movement and exercise.
Consistency NOT time of day is the key to any exercise regimen.
A walk in the park at 6AM or 2PM would have the same effects on "health".
Ask him explain to explain the reasoning behind this - and - if he'd send or write down the the name of the research article(s). 
I'd gladly review it for you.

UPDATE
Sorry just saw you said he has no research backing this claim. 

I can tell you if you prefer to walk in the evening this is just as
  beneficial as walking in the morning.  You will see the same health
  benefits.

Walking is a fantastic exercise, so do it whenever it works best for you!
