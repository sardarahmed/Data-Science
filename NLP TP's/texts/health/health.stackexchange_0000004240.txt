Q:

Can spinal cord's C3 disc apply pressure on C7?

Part of a medical exam result reads:   

C3 to C7 mild posterior disc bulging with mild impression on dural sac is seen.

Given the fact that C3 is followed by C4 in the cervical cord, can C3 apply any pressure  on C7 which is located much below it? Is there any possiblity of typo in the exam?   

A:

I think you are misunderstanding what that sentence says - as I interpret it it means that the posterior discs from C3 to C7 are bulging. So all five of them, C3/4/5/6/7 (or rather, the four discs between them) are affected.
