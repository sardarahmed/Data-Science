Q:

Why is sepsis more common with leukemia than with cancers involving physical tumors?

Does it have something to do with differences between leukemia versus other cancers, or differences between the treatments of leukemia versus other cancers?
Quote from the source:

People with cancers of the blood, such as leukemia, are more likely to develop septic shock than those with solid tumours.

A:

It's a combination.
By definition, leukemia affects the production and/or development of white blood cells (MedlinePlus - Leukemia). If not enough white blood cells are produced (AKA neutropenia) or those white blood cells don't work properly, the body is less able to fight infection, potentially leading to sepsis (MedlinePlus - Low WBC). A solid tumor won't usually affect white blood cell production like this.
Also, leukemia is pretty much always treated with chemotherapy (Mayo Clinic - Leukemia), which causes neutropenia. Chemo is common in treating solid tumors, but not universal; some early breast cancers, for example, are treated only with surgery, or only surgery and radiation (NCCN Patient Guidelines DCIS - see pg. 29).
Additionally, radiation for leukemia can weaken the immune system. Radiation for solid tumors is usually very targeted to minimize side effects, but for leukemia a larger area often needs to be treated. This makes many side effects, including neutropenia, more common for that type of radiation (Mayo Clinic - Low Blood Cell Counts).
Lastly, "Full body radiation", which completely destroys the body's ability to produce any white blood cells, may be done in preparation for a bone marrow transplant to treat leukemia. Severe infections, including sepsis, are a serious potential side effect (MedlinePlus - Bone Marrow Transplant).
