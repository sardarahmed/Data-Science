Q:

Do artificial sweeteners cause insulin spikes?

Which artificial sweeteners can cause insulin spikes? 

A:

There is a good article on that in Nature, where in a study it was found that non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) in fact do lead to a rise of serum insuline levels, possibly via a induced change of the gut flora, proven by the fact that the effect could be reproduced after fecal transplantation in mice.

And this is about the status of scientific knowledge about it. There is a good review on the NAS topic in childrens' diets.
Also, Aspartame exposure during pregnancy has been found to reduce insulin sensitivity in male mice, thereby showing a gender difference and other side effects.
So, to answer the question: By today's knowledge it's yes, they may cause insulin spikes, but rather indirectly. But nonetheless, they produce measurable adverse effects on your glucose homeostasis, the pathways of which are still not quite clear but may - amongst others - have to do with your gut flora, your insulin receptor sensitivity or behaviourial mechanisms of the brain reacting to sweet taste.
