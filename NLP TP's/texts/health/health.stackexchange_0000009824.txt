Q:

How does resting influence the recovery time of a common cold?

It seems to be self-evident: If I have a cold, I stay at home, snug under my bed cover, drink a lot of tea and either sleep and let myself be distracted by a book or a movie, until I donâ€™t feel weak anymore.
But is there evidence that this actually speeds up the recovery? To what extent? Is it only necessary to rest physically (e.g. stay in bed, but do work there), or should I relax completely for a quick recover?

A:

There is no evidence to suggest that rest has any influence on rate of recovery. However, fluids do help. 
There are almost no 'cures' for common cold. However, a variety of remedies do work to lessen the symptoms that we are only too well aware of (malaise, aches, fatigue, irritation, etc). And these remedies are not universal. People have sets of highly personalised and mostly diet based remedies that seem to take the edge off the unpleasantness associated with cold. 
Hot teas, tea with lemon and/or honey, chicken soup have all been documented anecdotally to contribute to early recovery.
And like your own experience, taking rest and your mind off the cold do helps 'hasten' time before you get well again. 
Hope this answers your question.
