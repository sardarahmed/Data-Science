Q:

Disadvantages of Running in Night after dinner

I want to reduce my waist size and I don't get much time in morning to run, so I am planning to run after dinner for 30 - 40 minutes.... My age is 26.  
Is there any disadvantages of running in night after dinner?

A:

Immediately after dinner - No. The body is re-directing a significant amount of blood to your stomach region to deal with the dinner you just had. 
Therefore, a run would not be advisable. 
You should ideally wait at least 2 hours after dinner and if the dinner was heavy, at least 4 hours to allow for the food to be digested.
Short answer: Wait for 2 to 4 hours after dinner before you run.
