Q:

Medical procedure to sever the brain's ability to communicate with the heart?

So, I think I read some-where that there is a surgical procedure to server the heart's ability to communicate with the brain, for reasons. A negative consequence of this was not being able to, for example, know if you're having a heart attack.
Know what I mean?
Edit: I'm asking for the name of the procedure.

A:

I believe the term you're looking for is cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD). This is a fairly non-technical explanation of the procedure. It can be left side only (LCSD), right side only (RCSD), or bilateral (BCSD). In short, it's a procedure of last resort to control ventricular arrhythmias when drugs and endocardial ablation procedures have failed.
