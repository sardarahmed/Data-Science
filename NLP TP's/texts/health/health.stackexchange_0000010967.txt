Q:

How to determine between a Baker's Cyst and a Deep-Vein-Thrombosis (DVT) behind knee?

Are there side by side image compairsons of what a Baker's Cysts (behind a knee) and a Deep Vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot behind the knee looks like? 
I know Baker's Cysts, while painful, are not life-threatening whereas as a DVT blood-clot is, and I'm having a hard time knowing what a deep purple and red spotted bruise behind the knee is serious or just the knocks around of life. (Not asking for a diagnosis). Just wondering if there is a side by side comparison of the commonalities and differentces of Baker's Cysts and DVT. 
Thanks!

A:

Baker's cyst typically appears as a single or multiple lump with clearly defined borders, covered by normal skin without discoloration (Google photos of Baker's cysts).
Varicose veins behind the knee appear as a net of knotted bluish threads (Photo).
Superficial thrombophlebitis can appear as a vague red discoloration without swelling on the lower leg rather than behind the knee (2 photos).
Deep vein thrombosis typically appears as a bluish patchy discoloration (not net-like like in varicose veins) and swelling in the lower leg (not likely behind the knee) (scroll to the image 4). Google search for "deep vein thrombosis behind knee" gives this misleading result, because most of those photos actually show varicose veins.
