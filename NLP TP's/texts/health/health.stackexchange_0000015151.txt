Q:

Red colors food and impact on stool colors

Does eating pink ginger with sushi and after pomegranate seeds transform the poo into red or a physician should be consulted if the red color is see again in the stool ?

A:

According to the Mayo Clinic, the following can turn your stool red: 

Red food coloring, beets, cranberries, tomato juice or soup, red
  gelatin or drink mixes.

A quick google search for "pomegranate red stool" shows several anecdotal results, but nothing that looks like a reputable source.
Anyone who is concerned about blood in their stool should see a doctor. However, if the red color consistently appears to be linked to dietary intake (stool is only red after eating pomegranates, for example), then the chances of having a bleed are low.
The test to see if there is blood in the stool is very quick and easy and can be done by a primary care doctor or in the emergency room, or even at home. It involves a rectal exam, followed by using a small amount of reagent to test the stool.
