Q:

Homeopathic remedy for low testosterone?

When one has low testosterone, allopathy only has the Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) available. This is a lifelong therapy and stops the natural production of testosterone. 
Medicine for erectile dysfunction exists in homeopathy. Are there drugs in homeopathy to boost Testosterone, not replace it altogether?

A:

I really recommend you go to a medical doctor for these issues.  I am all about evidence-based alternative medicine, but in general, Homeopathy has very poor evidence for being able to treat most things.  Another Meta-analysis this year of homeopathy have turned up empty on a lot of things.  
From Wikipedia referencing this article:

A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that the most
  reliable evidence did not support the effectiveness of
  non-individualized homeopathy. The authors noted that "the quality of
  the body of evidence is low."

Its best efficacy is generally due to placebo effect, which may be responsible for its efficacy in ED, as many cases of ED have at least partial psychological etiology. Testosterone is part of your endocrine system, not as likely to respond to homeopathy.
Note that erectile dysfunction in a young man can be herald of early cardiovascular disease.  More reason to get a doctor to see you.
