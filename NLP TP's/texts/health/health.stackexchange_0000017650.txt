Q:

Is rabies virus infectious outside host?

Can rabies virus remain infectious on environment i.e on soil, grasses, leaves and water?
I am just paranoid I may come into contact with rabid animal's saliva without knowing it. So wanted to know if the virus can infect like this.

Can rabies virus remain infectious on environment i.e on soil, grasses, leaves and water?

Generally, an exposure requires a bite from an infected animal, or saliva or neural tissue to be introduced to an open wound or mucous membrane.  The CDC has a succinct description here.
There are rare instances of infection from other exposures:
Human to human transmission can occur via tissue and organ transplantation from a person who died of rabies.
There were two cases (in 1956 and 1958) where transmission to humans was  attributed to aerosol exposure in a particular cave in Texas inhabited by millions of bats.  This may have involved direct contact with saliva or neural tissue. There is a fascinating 1962 study, in response to these reports, that suggests transmission to animals without direct contact with the bats. A more recent study also demonstrated aerosol transmission between animals. This type of transmission seems to require a very particular environment and a large dose of virus.
In summary
Generally you need direct exposure to an animal for it to be considered an infectious exposure. There are very rare reports of two other types of exposure described above. If, somehow, you have a large, still wet sample of saliva or CSF from a rabid animal laying on soil, grass, or leaves, though, there may be viable virus. Rabies is not particularly hardy, and difficult to maintain in culture. There are no reports of transmission from fomites (contaminated objects in the environment).
