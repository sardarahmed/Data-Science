Q:

Temperature effect on metal implant

I'm working on a university project involving the design of a metal implant. We're considering using a shape memory alloy, nitinol, for an intramedullary nail that changes shape with temperature. The idea is that it should expand in the body when implanted to increase friction and thus stabilisation but what happens if the person goes to a cold place, isn't homoeostasis supposed to keep the body at 37 degrees celsius, how much would the temperature of the implant change according to weather when inside the body. Thanks in advance. 

A:

Normal body temperature varies from around 36ºC (sometimes perhaps a little less, even) to around 37.5ºC... Inside the body itself, you might have a higher temperature by around 0.5ºC
