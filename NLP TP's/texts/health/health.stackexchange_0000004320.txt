Plant based - Work for Vegans as well 

No: 

No eggs or animal / meat/ fish 

A:

Branch chain amino acids is a term used for three of the essential amino acids. They are not something exotic, but something humans need to survive, and contained in most human foods. In fact, if they were missing from your diet, you'd have a protein deficiency, something practically unheard of in the Western world in our times. 
As long as you are eating protein from sufficiently varied sources, avoiding these amino acids would be almost impossible even if you tried to do it on purpose. So listing the foods which contain BCAA makes no sense, the list is almost as long as the foods you can eat. 
If looking at main food groups, you will get them from

dairy 
grains 
legumes
nuts 

You won't be able to get them from fruit and vegetables, because they are almost all water and no protein, or from honey or maple syrup, because these are sugars, and have no protein. For the food groups listed above, assume unprocessed variants. That is, whole wheat berries will contain them, wheat starch won't, and for any other product "in the middle" you'll need to know the exact type of processing, or just look it up in a standard nutrition database. Dairy is the exception, it will keep them when processed into cheese or yoghurt (but not butter). 
If you buy labelled food, the amount of BCAA will correlate well with the amount of protein given on the label, with variance between foods being leveled out by a varied diet.
