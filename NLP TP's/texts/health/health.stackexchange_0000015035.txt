Q:

What does "axonal features" mean?

In the results of an electromyography comes: polyneuropathy with axonal features
What does "axonal features" mean?

A:

Axonal features means that there is evidence to suggest damage to the axon as opposed to the myelin sheath.
Essentially axonal damage leads to a reduction of amplitude with preservation of nerve conduction velocity whereas demyelination results in a reduction of conduction velocity.
