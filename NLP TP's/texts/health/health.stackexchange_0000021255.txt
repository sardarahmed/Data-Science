Q:

What is the difference between a foramen and a fissure?

From my understanding, a foramen is a round opening inside a bone, whilst a fissure is a slightly longer opening? What exactly qualifies a fissure as a fissure and not a foramen? Why is the superior orbital fissue not a foramen? 

A:

That's right, the difference is in the shape.
According to dictionary, a fissure is:

A narrow opening produced by cleavage or separation of parts.
...
Anatomy. A natural division or groove in an organ, as in the brain.

Whilst a foramen usually describes a (somewhat) round "hole".
