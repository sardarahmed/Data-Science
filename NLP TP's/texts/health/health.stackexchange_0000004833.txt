Q:

What causes aortic aneurysm

An aortic aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in the aorta, the large artery
that carries blood from the heart through the chest and torso.
What could be the possible causes of aneurism?

In order for an aneurysm to occur, conditions must be present that cause degradation or abnormal development of the structural components of the blood vessel wall.
We can list out common causes into those two categories:
Degradation/Degenerative factors
The usual suspects.
These factors all contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and biomechanical wall stress in blood vessels like the aorta. This damage to the structural integrity of the aortic wall can lead to an aneurysm.

Aging
Cigarrete smoking
Hypercholesterolemia
Hypertension
Artherosclerosis

Abnormal development
These factors can lead to a weakened and vulnerable aortic wall:

Marfan's syndrome
Loeys-Diets syndrome
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV
Turner's syndrome
Bicuspid aortic valve

Other causes can include infections or chest trauma.
