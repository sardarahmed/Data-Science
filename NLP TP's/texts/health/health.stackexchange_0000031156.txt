Q:

What is the difference between different mask standards?

I am looking at buying a new batch of masks, since I still prefer to use a mask for my travelling. I am close to running out again, and the company that I previously got masks from now has a 'new' mask with a different standard. However, I can't find what the difference would be between the different mentioned standards. The only thing I can find is sites that sell very expensive spec sheets, which is a bit beyond the point for me. I understand that they are both European standards, but I can't find sources on what the difference would be.
I am posing the question a bit more broad, since I think it might be a valuable source to have more different standards mentioned together. But the two standards in question are:
'Old' masks: EN149:2001+A1:2009
'New' masks: CE 1463, EN149+A1:2010

My simple consumerism brain goes "oeh bigger number better", but that's not how it always works. I am aware of the difference between FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. But both of these masks are labeled FFP2. For the sake of argument, let's  assume the masks are 'real'.
What is the difference between the standards used for masks?
And more specifically put, what is the difference between the masks I'm looking at?

Mods: I hope I found the right StackExchange to ask this question. If you think there is a better place for this question then please let me know!

A:

The FFPx standards refer to the efficiency of the mask and the minimum particle size it filters out:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7248188/#:~:text=FFP1%20refers%20to%20the%20least,filtering%20mask%20of%20the%20FFPs.

FFP1 refers to the least filtering of the three masks with an aerosol
filtration of at least 80% for 0.3 Î¼m particles, and is mainly used as
an environmental dust mask. FFP2 masks have a minimum of 94%
filtration percentage whilst FFP3 masks are the most filtering mask of
the FFPs. With a minimum filtration percentage of 99%, they protect
against very fine particles such as asbestos.

So FFP1s are simply dust masks, good for sanding in your workshop but not good for medical use. FFP2s are basically the N95/KN95/EN149 masks, and FFP3s are the N99 masks. The general recommendations from the US CDC for protection from COVID are the KN95/N95/EN149 masks, although N95 should be reserved for use by medical professionals.
