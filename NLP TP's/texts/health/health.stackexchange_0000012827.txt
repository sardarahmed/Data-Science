Q:

Anorexia and drinking water

I would like to know whether anorexic people have trouble with drinking water as well or just solid food.
Thanks.

A:

The short answer is: No. 
However, A number of psychological factors contribute to Anorexia nervosa and some patients might also have issues with water intake.
It is interesting to note that Anorexia nervosa is stongly related to impaired water metabolism (water balance in other words), at times (rarely) leading to water intoxication and even death.
