Q:

Do NSAIDs "Relieve Pain" or is it a Byproduct?

NSAIDs work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and/or COX-2). In cells, these enzymes are involved in the synthesis of key biological mediators, namely prostaglandins which are involved in inflammation, and thromboxanes which are involved in blood clotting.

I am trying to understand what ibuprofen / aspirin / etc actually do. I know nothing about biology, so I don't really know what "pain" really is. With that said, do NSAIDs just reduce inflammation, thereby reducing pain as a "side-effect". Or do they reduce inflammation and have another, primary, effect of reducing pain somehow?
In short, let's say I burn my arm. Will ibuprofen reduce pain, or does it only reduce pain when an injury is aggrevated by inflammation, e.g. inflammed cartilage rubbing together?

A:

Injury or infection triggers the release of prostaglandins, which can cause pain, fever and inflammation (all of which are direct effects of prostaglandins).
Painkillers and Prostaglandins (Nature):

Prostaglandins are powerful signaling agents in the human body. The
  two-dozen or so members of this family of small lipid messengers
  underpin many profound physiological events â€” including vasodilation,
  vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, platelet activation,
  inflammation, uterine contractions, pain perception and fever.

Mechanisms of inflammatory pain (Academic.oup.com):

prostaglandins contribute to pain by directly activating nociceptors

This means that NSAIDs can relieve pain even if there is no inflammation, for example, in tension headache (PubMed).
