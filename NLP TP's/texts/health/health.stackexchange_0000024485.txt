Q:

Why is the lifetime prevalence of depression lower than the point prevalence? Figures from a study

From an article titled "Prevalence of Depression in the Community from 30 Countries between 1994 and 2014 (Lim et al., Scientific Reports, 2018)":

A random-effects model meta-analysis that was performed to calculate the aggregate point, one-year and lifetime prevalence of depression calculated prevalences of 12.9%, 7.2% and 10.8% respectively.

Why is the lifetime prevalence lower than point prevalence? It appears to me that lifetime prevalence includes all people who have ever had an episode of depression, and surely a point prevalence would miss some of them, whenever it was assessed. Thus a lower lifetime prevalence looks odd.
Where is my mistake here?

A:

You have not made a mistake.  Point prevalence must be lower than 1-year prevalence and 1-year prevalence must be lower than lifetime prevalence for a population.
In the systematic review, there are 68 studies that provided estimates of point prevalence, 9 that provided estimates of 1-year prevalence and 13 that provided estimates of lifetime prevalence (N=13).  Inspecting Figures 1, 2, and 3, there are no studies that provided estimates of point prevalence and also provided an estimate of 1-year prevalence.  Similarly, there are no studies that provided an estimate of 1-year prevalence that also provided an estimate of lifetime prevalence.  That is, there are no studies of point prevalence, 1-year prevalence, and lifetime prevalence for the same population.
It is not possible to obtain generalizable estimates of the point prevalence, 1-year prevalence, and lifetime prevalence that can be compared from a set of studies that come from different countries and continents, were done at disparate time periods, and used different methods.
The particular studies used to estimate lifetime prevalence are problematic.
Two of the studies used to make the estimate of the lifetime prevalence of depression (Altamura 1995 and Carta 1995) come from Sardinia, a small island off Italy.  The study is not generalizable.  The publications may present duplicate data.

One of the studies (Beals 2005) was a study of members of Native American tribes living in the Southwest or the Northern Plains.
https://pmlegacy.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16135632

A total of 3,084 tribal members (1,446 in a Southwest tribe [73.7% of
eligible participants] and 1,638 in a Northern Plains tribe [76.8% of
eligible participants]) age 15-54 years living on or near their home
reservations were interviewed.

One of the studies (Ialongo 2004) was a study that involved predominantly poor, young, African-Americans living in Baltimore.

The present report describes the prevalence of major depressive
disorder (MDD) in an epidemiologically-defined population of 1197,
predominately poor, African-American 19-22-year-olds, living in the
greater Baltimore, MD metropolitan area.

One of the studies (Pakriev 2009) was a study of 323 adult inpatients in Russia.

The particular estimate of the lifetime prevalence of depression for the Smith (2013) study in the meta-analysis is 6.4%.  But Smith 2013 reported separate estimates of the lifetime prevalence of a single episode of depression (6.4%), probable recurrent major depression (moderate) (12.2%), and probable recurrent major depression (severe) (7.2%).  These should have been added to estimate the lifetime prevalence of any major depression--25.8% instead of 6.4%.  This study, because of its size (172,751 people), heavily weights the summary estimate of prevalence and the mistake is serious.

Prevalence rates for probable single lifetime episode of major
depression (6.4%), probable recurrent major depression (moderate)
(12.2%), probable recurrent major depression (severe) (7.2%) and
probable bipolar disorder (1.3%) were comparable to those found in
other population studies.

In the 1990’s, there was an international effort aimed at understanding international differences in the lifetime prevalence of depression using common methods.

Community epidemiological surveys using the World Health Organization
Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered face-to-face
were carried out in 10 countries in North America (Canada and the US),
Latin America (Brazil, Chile, and Mexico), Europe (Czech Republic,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey), and Asia (Japan). The total
sample size was more than 37,000. Lifetime prevalence estimates of
hierarchy-free DSM-III-R/DSM-IV MDE varied widely, from 3% in Japan to
16.9% in the US, with the majority in the range of 8% to 12%.
