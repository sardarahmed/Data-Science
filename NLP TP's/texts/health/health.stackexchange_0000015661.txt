Q:

Combined consumption of green tea and cheese / meat

If I drink green tea it happens that after 1-1.5h I feel very tired. I noticed that this does not happen if I consume cheese / meat while drinking green tea. If I eat vegetables or grains during the consumption of green tea the effect is nearly the same, as if I don't eat anything, i.e. starting to feel tired after 1-1.5h. 
I use only one bag of tea for 800-1000ml and consume about 2000-3000ml of green tea a day.
I also read that when eating diary products while drinking green tea it helps to preserve the integrity and antioxidant activity of polyphenols during digestion.
The question is now, what are other interactions between cheese / meat and green tea which could explain this phenomena, i.e. not feeling tired vs. feeling tired after consuming green tea depending on the food consumed concomitantly.

A:

Cheese and meat are both high in fat, which slows down the emptying of the stomach content (including tea) into the small intestine more than carbohydrate foods (vegetables and grains). So, taking tea with fatty foods will slow down the absorption of caffeine and other tea components and result in lower peak blood caffeine levels than taking tea on an empty stomach or with carbs.

Increasing the energy content of the meal of fixed composition
  progressively delayed gastric emptying.

Cheese and meat usually have more energy than the same amount of carbohydrate foods.
