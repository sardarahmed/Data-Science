Q:

Are tobacco packaging warning messages improving health of society?

Are there any countries with law not requiring such warnings? If yes, were there conducted any smokers-related studies?

A:

Do Cigarette Warning Labels Reduce Smoking?

Another study came up with 

Approximately one fifth of participants [by the way there are 616 adult smokers] reported smoking less as a result of the labels; only 1% reported smoking more. Although participants reported negative emotional responses to the warnings including fear (44%) and disgust (58%), smokers who reported greater negative emotion were more likely to have quit, attempted to quit, or reduced their smoking 3 months later. Participants who attempted to avoid the warnings (30%) were no less likely to think about the warnings or engage in cessation behavior at follow-up.
