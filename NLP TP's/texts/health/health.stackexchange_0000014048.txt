Q:

Medical Images and workflow

What is the general workflow involved in managing images such as X-ray, scan etc in a day to day job of a healthcare-technician or a doctor? 
I am interested to know more about how these images are shared, viewed, tagged and passed around for review.
Any online resources regarding this will be useful, as I am really struggling to get resources around this coming from a tech back ground. 

A:

Take a look at the IHE Radiology Scheduled Workflow integration profile in IHE Radiology (RAD) Technical Framework. This explains a common workflow model.
