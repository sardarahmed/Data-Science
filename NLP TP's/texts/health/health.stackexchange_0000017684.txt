Q:

Are auditory hallucinations a side effect of Oxycodone? How long does Oxycodone stay in the body?

Are auditory hallucinations a side effect of Oxycodone (when used for a short period following a surgery)? 
To give this question context, the following situation has been provided (not to be interpreted for diagnostic reasons specific to the individual): 
A person in their 30's had and was prescribed some medicine to manage pain. Oxycodone was taken several times the day of and after surgery. On the fourth day of recovery, while alone in residence, a deep man's voice is clearly and directly heard, saying, "Get Out!" 
So basically... Could Oxycodone taken 2 days prior cause an auditory hallucination? 
(Again, not asking for a diagnosis -- just wondering, in general, about how long Oxycodone could be in a person's system to cause auditory hallucinations?) 

A:

There are some rare anecdotal reports of auditory hallucinations related to oxycodone. For example:
Example 1
Example 2
But the half-life of oxycodone is a mere 3-4 hours, so after two days there should have been virtually no oxycodone present.
However, according to the same link above, oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidneys, so if the patient in question had impaired kidney function, it's possible that oxycodone remained present that long. And that brings into focus why questions about particular patients are a poor fit for this site. There are just too many variables to answer individual experiences.
