Q:

Is Porn-Creep a medical condition? Addiction to pornography (for men) correlate to erectile dysfunction?

Is Porn-Creep a medical condition? We all know that pornography can be highly addictive and can in many circumstances  ruin relationships. Does it correlate to erectile dysfunction for men and/or an inability for men to orgasm/reach climax? Or have a healthy libido?

A:

Let's start with your assumptions.  You say that "We all know that pornography can be highly addictive."  But in fact, porn addiction is not a recognized diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.  In addition, in November 2016, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) issued a position statement on sex / porn addiction which states that AASECT "does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder." (See https://www.aasect.org/position-sex-addiction)
So no, the medical community does not agree that porn addiction is a real thing.
Now, let's consider the effect of porn viewing on ED.  A number of studies have shown a correlation between porn viewing and ED.  But correlation does not prove causation.  It may be that men with ED simply watch more porn.  (See https://edtreatment.info/does-porn-cause-ed-erectile-dysfunction/)
At the moment, I would say that this is an open question.  There is no clear evidence that watching porn causes ED.
