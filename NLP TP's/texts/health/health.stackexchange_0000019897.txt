Q:

Choice of foods and proportions for vegans

Relating to the average patient's meal, which foods and how would the portion size be modified in order to meet Dietary Guidelines.
EDIT: In other words, what to think about when designing vegan meals in hospitals?  

A:

I've found 2019 Canada's Dietary Guidelines - full version for professionals (easy to read, references to scientific evidence).
Recommended intakes for macronutrients in a 2,000 Calorie/day diet: (RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance is the amount that should be sufficient for most adults ; AMDR = Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (in % of total energy intake); links to vegan foods included:

Carbohydrate: RDA: 130 g/day ; AMDR: 45-65% of total energy

Fiber: 21-30 g/day
Free sugars (in fruit juices or added as in sweetened beverages): <10% of total energy (<50 g)

Protein: RDA = 0.80 g/kg body weigh/day (56 g/70 kg man; 46 g/58 kg woman); AMDR = 10-35% of total energy
Fat: AMDR = 20-35% of total energy

Saturated fat: <10% total energy (<20 g/day)
Trans fat: <1% total energy (<2 g/day)

Recommended intakes for micronutrients:

Minerals
Vitamins

An "average meal" in a hospital can refer to a healthy meal intended for an omnivore person with no special dietary needs. Vegan meals in hospitals, which do not contain meat, fish, eggs and milk, should contain enough iron and protein from plant sources.
Plant foods rich in iron (USDA.gov):

Beans, peas, lentils
Cereals ready-to-eat (fortified)
Sunflower and pumpkin seeds
Nuts: cashew, pine
Lupins
Spinach
Grains: amaranth, barley, cornmeal, kamut, oats, quinoa, rye, semolina, shorghum, spelt
Beets
Dried figs

Plant foods high in protein (>10 g/serving) and low in fat (<10 g/serving)(USDA.gov):

Lupins
Beans, lentils and peas (most types)
Grains: cornmeal, quinoa, spelt, triticale
Fermented soy: hummus, tempeh, tofu 

Foods high in protein but also in fat include most nuts and seeds.
Maybe the most appropriate beverages are those that are low in sugar: plain or mineral water, vegetable juices, tea.
Vegan patients who stay in a hospital for several months may also benefit from vitamin D and B12 supplements.
When designing vegan meals in hospitals, one can use the info from USDA Food Composition Database, linked above.
