Q:

Why COVID-19 vaccine defies the 12-18 month estimation?

Most of us are expecting a COVID-19 within 12-18 months. But how come in the past week, I find multiple articles and news reports suggesting the possibility of a vaccine in the fall. While this is cleary a few months ahead of the projected estimate, what are the factors that are speeding up the initial estimation of the vaccine?

Second, while most of these vaccines are projected to be released as early as September, and many experts estimate it will be until next year, like March or April of 2021, when many more vaccines will be out. So, if the vaccines projected to be ready by September fail, will there be any other vaccines that are estimated to be ready between September and April 2021, say, maybe a vaccine ready by as early as November or December?

A:

The vaccine isn't defying the 12-18 month estimate, assorted company PR departments are defying the 12-18 month estimate.  It's unlikely that an actual vaccine will become available in the timeframe these people are promising.
