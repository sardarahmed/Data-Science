Q:

Is it dangerous to eat bananas and eggs together?

I read that the combination of bananas and eggs is poisonous. I searched on the internet and found out that certain food (fruits and eggs, fruits and milk) shouldn't be eaten together but I couldn't understand why.
Is this true? and what happens to my body if I eat them together? 

A:

Utter nonsense. Many common recipes combine bananas and eggs. People eat bananas with eggs all the time without harm. I've had some of these myself and they're tasty. 
Banana pancakes
Banana bread
Fruity egg muffins
Banana Licuado 

A:

I read that the combination of bananas and eggs is poisonous.

Can you please give the exact links? Google does auto-suggest a link but as Carey has also mentioned, it doesn't make any sense.
It is highly unlikely that a fruit (banana which is rich in Potassium, Vitamins C & B6, Fibre and fats) and egg( rich in Fats, protein, and cholesterol) would mix up together to form anything toxic.
Instead, they are generally mixed together, to make different recipes like pancake. Please try looking at right places to read, and yes, do NOT always believe in what you read online!
