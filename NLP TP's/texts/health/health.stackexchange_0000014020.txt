Q:

Chagas disease: stages

As far as I understand the stages of Chagas disease are three: acute, indeterminate and cronic. 
Question
Supposing someone is on third stage, does it mean that he/she has previously go through indeterminate stage? 
In other words: Is indeterminate stage a necessary condition to cronic stage?

A:

Here an answer. Everybody is invited to debate. The person who wrote it is a Chagas disease specialist, Dr Anis Rassi Jr. So thanks Dr Rassi for the answer.

The phases of the disease are only 2: acute and chronic. The chronic
  phase is divided into: indeterminate form, cardiac form, digestive
  form and cardio-digestive form. With the exception of only about 5% of
  the patients who right after the acute phase get directly into a
  determinate form, all the others get into the indeterminate form. Of
  those in the indeterminate form, about 60% will remain indeterminate
  all lifelong while about 40% of patients 10 to 30 years later develop
  the clinical forms of the disease.
