Q:

Is there a safe way to increase bones length?

I'm not sure if I selected the appropriate stackexchange sub-site, probably I had to use 'biology' instead, but I think those ones of you, who are doctors, are familiar with biology as well.
I'm just wondering, is there any safe way to increase bones length using medicine / science? My question might sound weird for you, but I'll explain why am I asking that. The thing is that I've been playing piano for a years, but I unfortunately my hands aren't big (just a regular ones, or probably even a little bit smaller than average male hands), however I would like to take wide chords, I need to do something to increase the length of my fingers a little bit (3-7mm for each finger should give me +1cm for a hand span [probably a little bit more]), and I try to find a way to do that using science.

A:

As an adult, no, there's no safe way to lengthen your bones.  The epiphyseal plates at the ends of your bones have ossified, so hormonal treatments have nothing to operate on.
There is a technique for lengthening bones in adults, distraction osteogenesis, where the bones are intentionally broken and then stretched during the healing process.  I've never heard of it being used on the fingers (as opposed to the leg bones or the jaw), and it's got a relatively high complication rate.
