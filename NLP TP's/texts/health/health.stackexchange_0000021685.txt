Q:

What's the best time of year to purposely contract COVID?

Before the vaccine for German measles was available, girls were encouraged to expose themselves to a friend or acquaintance who had the disease, to acquire immunity, so that they would not end up contracting the illness later on during a pregnancy.
Following on from that logic, would it make sense for a person over 60 (of generally good health and a non-smoker) to purposely contract COVID some time this summer, so as to have immunity next winter?  (Obviously, if the person did that, they would strictly quarantine themselves.)
I've understood that social distancing practices are partly designed to smear out infections, so they don't all hit a community suddenly like a tsunami.  So, that leads me to think that it would be beneficial for society to have new cases occur in a staggered way.

A:

Rubella doesn't generally kill that's why they had those parties lacking a vaccine.
Since we are now seeing many ICU beds being occupied by victims in their 30s etcï¼Œ a different patient profile than in China, then it would be like using Russian roulette doing what you suggest.
