Q:

I am confused about this hot sauce nutrition label

So I know calorie rounding is a thing. Although I don't know how it really works. Something like if it's under 5 calories you can put it as zero, correct?
Regardless why is it, in the per 100 grams section, it says it contains 2 calories but 20 grams of carbs/sugar? How does that work?

A:

Per 100 gram:

Sugars = 20 g x 4 kcal = 80 kcal
Fiber = 2 g x 2 kcal = 4 kcal
Protein = 1 g x 4 kcal = 4 kcal
In total: 88 Kcal (368 kJ) and not 10kJ as stated.

Carbohydrate total is also wrong. It should be 22 g (not 20 g): 20 g of sugar and 2 g of fiber.
