Q:

Fluoride poisoning by toothpaste

Long story short:
Is there a maximum number of teeth brushing per day without having fluoride poisoning?

Full story:
It is certain that a high fluoride intake leads to health problems.  This is related to ingestion only (that is swallowing toothpaste, drinking high-fluoride water, eating rich-fluoride food) of this element.
While, when we talk about fluoride in toothpastes, we have a completely different assumption and absorption mechanism.
Thus, I assume, there will be different AI (adequate intake) and UL (upper intake level) than for fluoride food assumption[a].

my assumption is sustained by the fact that most commercial toothpastes[b][c][d] have less than 1500 ppm of Fâˆ’ in them

Ultimately, does exist a daily upper safety level for fluorine absorbed from the toothpaste?

A:

TL;DR: Unless you brush your teeth multiple times an hour and swallow the toothpaste, you likely won't ingest a significant enough quantity of fluoride to cause any issues.

Per the label for Sodium Fluoride chewable tablets:

A treatment dose of Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets contains 0.25, 0.5 or 1.0 mg fluoride

A standard OTC toothpaste, in this case e.g. Crest Pro-Health, contains 0.454% fluoride. For you to get 1mg of fluoride from this toothpaste, you would have to swallow just over 220g. One tube is 130g.
If we assume that you use 5g of toothpaste with each brushing, you would have to brush your teeth, and swallow the toothpaste 44 times per day to get 1mg of fluoride, still within what is considered a normal dose for this substance.
Even redoing this calculation with a prescription only toothpaste, e.g. Prevident 1.1%, you would still need to brush and swallow 18 times per day to get 1mg of fluoride.
