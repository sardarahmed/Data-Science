Q:

Why is a tonsillectomy (tonsil-removal) typically more painful the older you are? Are the the pain nerves more advanced?

I had my tonsils removed in my mid twenties, and my doctors told me that it was going to be a lot more painful than if I had done it when I was just a lad. They were certainly correct!!
Why is it that a tonsillectomy is more painful to have as an adult? Are the pain nerves more mature? Or is it that the tonsil is larger than when I was a child?

A:

After removal of tonsils, most adults
  have significant pain for 10 -14 days, some up to 3 weeks. Because 
  adults & teenagers have larger tonsils and more developed throat muscles, pain and muscle spasm can 
  make it difficult to swallow for 2 weeks or more.  Constipation may occur because narcotic pain 
  medication, when taken regularly, can slow down the bowels.  link
