Q:

Outcomes and risks of LASIK surgery

If an individual with poor eyesight undergoes LASIK surgery, will it return the sight exactly to normal? What are the risks of the procedure? Are there any side effects or complications to be concerned about?

A:

Post-operative complications include the following:

Visually significant wrinkles or striae in the flap (1%)
Dislocated flap (early postoperative period)
Infection (early postoperative period; very rare; < 0.02%)
Diffuse intralamellar keratitis (< 0.1%)
Epithelial ingrowth (early to late postoperative; 1-2%)
Under/overcorrection (see results)
Ectasia (incidence unknown; < 0.01%)

In general, LASIK results are better for patients with low myopia (between 1-6 D) and low astigmatism (< 1 D). Stability has been reported to be good with little or no change noted in most patients between 3 months and 1 year postoperative. Other factors that can affect results include the type of laser and microkeratome used and surgeon experience.
But:

But personally I have heard from some of my colleges that it can recur again after 10yr or so.
The procedure is nothing but to reduce cornea part of eye, so in future at old age if you develop cataract (which has incidence of above 70%among old age people), cataract surgery options gets limited because we have lost considerable amount of cornea for this LASIK.  
My old Opthalmology professor, denied me to go for LASIK (I am too myopic - wear glass). He gave me 5 min lecture on that day telling about complication (I miss him now though). This conversation happened 2 yr back.  Not ages old.
He just told "don't waste your cornea"
