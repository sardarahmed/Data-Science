Q:

If a person has lockjaw, what disease is he or she suffering from?

Many times I have seen that a persons mouth is forced shut due to the locking of the jaw muscles. You need to apply a lot of force in order to open the mouth.
The cause is a disease that is very dangerous. So I like to know more about this disease.

A:

Your question is unclear. But I (and with me some others) think you are referring to Tetanus. 
Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani, bacteria found in street dirt and animal dung (for example horse dung). The bacteria enters the wound through a dirty wound (for example a bike accident). It can be cured by a Tetanus vaccination that must be appllied in a few days. 
The vaccination last for 10 to 15 years but is sometimes renewed within 7 years. If the victim is not vaccinated the disease can be deadly. One of the symptoms is muscle stiffness often started with the jaw muscles hence the name lock jaw.
