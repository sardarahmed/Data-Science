Q:

Is it possible to spread cough even if I'm not coughing?

I don't have a cough but sometimes when I go into a place a moment later a person starts to cough. Last time I met my friend that I didn't seen for a long time, having some conversation after a few minutes he suddenly coughs. It keeps bothering me, what does it mean? When I go into a place or talk to someone they will start coughing.

A:

No, it just happens and you're overthinking about it. It means absolutely nothing. 
Cough is a protective reflex, which helps to clear the large breathing passages from fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. A cough can also be psychogenic or neurogenic but certainly not telepathic or magic.

What causes coughs:
Most coughs are caused by cold or flu.
Other causes include:
smoking,
allergies(for example hay fever),
infections like bronchitis,
mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose.
A cough is very rarely a sign of something serious like lung cancer.
