Q:

Is biopsy still required for cancer diagnosis given that advanced medical imaging is now available?

For cancer diagnosis, there is biopsy, an invasive technique. However, PET CT, SPECT CT, MRI are non-invasive. Do oncologists still require the use of biopsy to ascertain type of cancer, i.e., to confirm the presence or absence of malignancy? If so, why?

A:

In many cases yes, a tumor must be biopsied in order to determine exactly what type of tumor it is. Advanced imaging can, in some cases, diagnose a specific type of tumor. However, there are many chemotherapy agents that are very specific not just to a particular tumor, but a particular tumor with certain genetic factors (such as presence or lack of specific receptors), so it is impossible to plan the best treatment without tissue.
