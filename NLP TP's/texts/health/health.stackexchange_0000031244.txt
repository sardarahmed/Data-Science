Q:

Administration of Covid Vaccine for Small Children in the EU

Is there a way to see the progress of the administration of Covid vaccines for small children (age under five) in the EU?
It is not easy to find all information in the usual news sources.
Maybe there is a website that shows the status for the different possible vaccines (Moderna, BioNtech, etc.).

A:

This site seems to give a reasonable overview:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-19-latest-updates
On 10th May the review for Spikevax started. No news for BioNtech.
