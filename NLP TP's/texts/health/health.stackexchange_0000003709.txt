Q:

Medical imaging - image quality?

Are there any resources or literature that spell out the factors affecting image quality for each of the main imaging techniques or can someone provide such a list?

A:

Here are some resources and books you can use but before that check out FDA ,radiologyeducation.com, virginia.edu , emory.edu and sprawls.org i think they can pretty much give you the information you want.
For fundamental information and physic of radiography ( which i think is the answer to your question) :
Principles of Radiographic Imaging: An Art and a Science
Review of Radiologic Physics
The Essential Physics of Medical Imaging
Fundamentals of Medical Imaging
Principles Radiographic Imaging Science
Radiology Fundamentals
Radiobiology for the Radiologist
For MRI i recommend :
MRI in Practice
For PET scan :
Basics of PET Imaging: Physics, Chemistry, and Regulations
CT scan :
Computed Tomography for Technologists
Step by Step Ct Scan
Fundamentals of Body Ct
If you need other sources you can see bookdepository and amazon I hope that i helped.
