Q:

Why is HIV singled out from other STIs?

If HIV is an STI, then why is HIV often listed separately?
Examples:

HIV & Sexually Transmitted Infections Fact sheet
STDs and HIV – CDC Fact Sheet
What You Need To Know About the Links Between HIV and STDs

A:

This is a good question, and although as you correctly state that HIV is an STI (see STI vs STD vs Sexually Transmitted Virus?) there is a difference with HIV which is one reason why it may be separated from others.
It can be thought that HIV is separated from STIs in factsheet titles etc. because HIV is a virus when others are not, but there are other STI viruses.  For example, there is:

Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), which is the name for a group of viruses that affect your skin and the moist membranes lining your body.
Herpes, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2).

It can also be thought that HIV is separated from STIs in factsheet titles etc. because HIV can be fatal, but there are other STIs which can lead to death. For example:

Syphilis can affect multiple organ systems, including the brain, nerves, eyes, liver, heart, and blood vessels.  The effects on the heart can lead to death.
Gonorrhea can also spread to the blood and cause disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). DGI is usually characterized by arthritis, tenosynovitis, and/or dermatitis. This condition can be life threatening.
HPV (Human Papillomavirus) can cause cervical and other cancers including cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. It can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils (called oropharyngeal cancer).

Possible reasons for separating HIV from other STIs in factsheets

The key thing with HIV is that apart from Hepatitis, which is also viral, all other STIs are generally only transmittable only through sexual contact. HIV can be transmitted through infected blood transfusions, use of infected needles, or through contact between broken skin of 2 or more people.

Note: Skin to skin contact with unbroken skin is safe

STIs are infections and STDs are the diseases as a result of the infection.  Some STDs don't share the same name as the STI which caused it.
(This applies to your question) The linked factsheets etc. you provided are talking about the links between HIV and other STIs.

How reason 3 applies here
Reading the detailed version of the CDC factsheet on HIV and STDs:

[P]eople who get syphilis, gonorrhea, and herpes often also have HIV or are more likely to get HIV in the future. One reason is the behaviors that put someone at risk for one infection (not using condoms, multiple partners, anonymous partners) often put them at risk for other infections.  Also, because STD and HIV tend to be linked, when someone gets an STD it suggests they got it from someone who may be at risk for other STD and HIV.  Finally, a sore or inflammation from an STD may allow infection with HIV that would have been stopped by intact skin.

Another interesting fact is that studies that have lowered the risk of STD in communities have not necessarily lowered the risk of HIV.  Risk of HIV was lowered in one community trial (Grosskurth, et al. 1995), but not in 3 others (Wawer, et al., 1999; Kamali, et al., 2003; Gregson, et al., 2007).
Also, treating individuals for STDs has not necessarily lowered their risk of acquiring HIV (Ghys, et al., 2001; Kaul, et al., 2004).

Question: If HIV is an STI, then why is HIV often listed separately, for example:

HIV & Sexually Transmitted Infections Fact sheet
STDs and HIV – CDC Fact Sheet
What You Need To Know About the Links Between HIV and STDs

Reason 1. The articles linked above have "HIV and STI" or "HIV or STDs" in the titles because they describe how a person with a certain sexually transmitted disease (STD), for example, genital herpes is at increased risk to catch HIV virus. So, there is not really any "listed separately" situation here.
Reason 2. In some older articles, like this one from 1994, "STDs and AIDS," are separated to make an emphasis on AIDS and compare the known STDs with AIDS, which was relatively new at the time.
Apart from the fact, that AIDS is the most severe/deadly STD, there is no biological reason to list them separately: HIV is a virus but so is Herpes; AIDS is a systemic disease and if left untreated it is often deadly, but the same is true for syphilis. It's more about how the authors decide to title their articles.

Explanation of the terms used to prevent confusion:
HIV refers to either the human immunodeficiency virus or, when this enters the body, to HIV infection, which is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). HIV infection becomes a sexually transmitted disease (STD), namely AIDS, only when it causes damage to the body and, usually, symptoms. So an STI is not already an STD, but in practice, both acronyms are often used as synonyms.
