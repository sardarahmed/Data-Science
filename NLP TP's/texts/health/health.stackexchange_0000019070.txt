Q:

Has a guideline been set for the optimal pH level in the mouth?

My thought is that improper pH might might be a factor in bacterial growth and tooth decay. Supporting the idea is this research summary that implicates low pH (high acidity) to Fluorosis.
Notes:
Since posting this I have become convinced that this is a thing so I have added some baking soda to my fluoride mouthwash to raise my oral pH (lower the acidity) and prevent fluorosis.

A:

The normal pH range of saliva is 6.2-7.6 (PubMed, 2013). The enamel starts to dissolve when the pH of the saliva or the fluid beneath the plaque falls under about 5.5, which is known as "critical pH" (Journal of Canadian Dental Association, 2003).
The pH of saliva falls, for example, when you drink acidic beverages, such as cola with pH 2.5-3.4 (PubMed, 2010).
The pH of the fluid beneath a dental plaque falls when the bacteria normally present in mouth convert certain nutrients, mainly sugars sucrose, glucose and fructose into acids (jisppd.com). Major sources of these sugars are table sugar, sweets, soft drinks, fruit juices and honey.
In one small study, oral rinse with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) increased the pH of saliva, which could, theoretically, help to prevent tooth decay (PubMed, 2017).
I haven't found any human trials in which toothpaste would be used to increase salivary pH.
Salivary characteristics and dental caries: Evidence from general dental practices (PubMed, 2013)

Our study findings show that salivary characteristics were associated
  weakly with recent dental caries experience, but we did not find
  consistent trends among the three age groups. Thus, one should
  interpret with caution an assessment of salivary consistency, salivary
  pH or salivary flow rate to determine the caries risk of all patients.

In conclusion, one may not need to focus on salivary pH, but try to avoid known risk factors for caries, mainly sugary foods and bad teeth hygiene (Mayo Clinic).
