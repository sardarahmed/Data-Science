Q:

Is there no drawback on removing varicose veins?

If we remove our varicose veins because they are useless,
would we get any drawbacks by removing them?
For example, we might need to remove rest of them next time.
Wouldn't it be a problem for us if we have very small number of veins in our leg, knee, or groin?

A:

Removing veins impairs blood flow to that area, but since the varicose veins aren't really getting blood efficiently to their locality anyway, I wouldn't call the lack of perfusion from removing them a drawback, per se. 
Some complications can arise following surgery to remove varicose veins. Some of them are pretty innocuous, like skin discoloration, but some can be more serious, 
such as deep vein thromboses or even nerve damage. Even then, the incidence of post-op complications is pretty low.
This paper describes a long-term reptrospective study of a cohort of patients who had a certain surgery to remove varicose veins and gives a nice, brief description of the complications that they experienced (there weren't many). 
This paper is much more comprehensive, if you're interested. 
I would say that the bottom line is that there aren't really drawbacks to removing varicose veins, but that there could be post-op difficulties to watch out for.
