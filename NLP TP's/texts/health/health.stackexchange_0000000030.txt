Q:

How to distinguish a non-inflammatory tendinopathy (a.k.a tendinosis) from an inflammatory tendinopathy (a.k.a. tendinitis)?

When suffering from some tendinopathy, how to distinguish whether the pain comes from a non-inflammatory tendinopathy (a.k.a tendinosis) or from an inflammatory tendinopathy (a.k.a. tendinitis)?

A:

Basically, something falls under the classification of "inflammed" based on the following five criteria:

Redness
Swelling
Heat
Pain
Loss of Function

If any of these apply to your tendinopathy, then it is probably tendinitis. Otherwise, it's probably non-inflammatory.
