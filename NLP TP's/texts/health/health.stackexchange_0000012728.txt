Q:

Just learned the previous two owners of the house I bought died of cancer, should I be worried?

I recently have purchased a home that was built in the late 80s. To my knowledge it has had two owners who have each lived there around 12-15 years each. While talking to the neighbors after moving in, I have now learned that both of the previous owners had a spouse die of cancer while living in the home. 
Is this something I should be worried about? Is there anything I can do to ensure my families safety (specific inspections, remove specific materials, etc.)? 
Thank you in advance for your help, I am quite worried about this.

A:

Currently, about 20% of people die of cancer.  As our ability to cure things that aren't cancer gets better, that number will only go up.
If you compute the probabilities, it turns out that for ever five houses where the previous four occupants died while living there, one of those houses will have had two or more occupants die of cancer (exact odds: 18.08%).  In short, what you've encountered is only slightly more unusual than flipping a coin twice and having it come up "tails" both times.
