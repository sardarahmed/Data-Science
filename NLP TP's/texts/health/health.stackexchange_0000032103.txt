Q:

Is there a prostate orgasm?

Is there any scientific evidence that orgasm can be achieved by stimulating the prostate?
The 2023 article "Atlas of the Experience of Receptive Anal Sex in People with a Prostate" states:

While many debates exist regarding the existence and relationship of
the “g spot” for men (most often associated with the prostate), there
is no conclusive empirical evidence to suggest that the prostate is
indeed responsible for these heightened sensations.

In the 2017 review "Prostate-induced orgasms: A concise review illustrated with a highly relevant case study" wrote (added to the question, but this review was already in the answer):

Because there have been no published laboratory-conducted
investigations of the orgasms induced by prostate stimulation alone,
information about them has to be gathered from the various websites
dedicated to such orgasms. While unsatisfactory in that the vast
number are obviously anecdotal they represent the only available
source

In homosexual relations, most men do not reach orgasm in receptive
anal intercourse, and a number report not reaching orgasm by any
method in many of their sexual relationships, which they nevertheless
enjoy.

Are there scientific studies with contrary conclusions?

A:

According to Prostate-induced orgasms: A concise review illustrated with a highly relevant case study, it appears there is no scientific evidence supporting or refuting the existence of prostate-induced orgasm, or at least there wasn't in 2017.

Because there have been no published laboratory-conducted
investigations of the orgasms induced by prostate stimulation alone,
information about them has to be gathered from the various websites
dedicated to such orgasms. While unsatisfactory in that the vast
number are obviously anecdotal they represent the only available
source.

However, the anecdotal evidence seems compelling:

Unlike the sparsity of academic literature on prostate-induced orgasms
there appears to be an enormous number of internet sites involving
such activity.

My own searches using similar but not identical search terms confirms there are a large number of people out there who claim to be able to induce orgasm with prostate  stimulation. The paper I cited includes a detailed case history of one such man.  Frankly, I see no reason not to believe them, or at least the ones who aren't selling something.
And a paper does exist [Do men have a G-spot JF Perry - Aust Forum, 1988] that claims men have an area functionally similar to the G-spot in women, and it is located where the prostate is located. Unfortunately, even though the paper is widely cited I can't find a copy, not even the abstract.

Perry (1988) suggested that this area of the rectal wall was similar
to the so-called ‘G-spot’ of the female in that it activated orgasm
when stimulated so it has been called ‘the male G-spot’, it is
anatomically incorrect but a widely used description.

So the answer to your question appears to be there is little, if any, scientific evidence supporting the notion of prostate-induced orgasms.
