Q:

Is there any intelligence in heart?

Is it correct to say that heart and brain both are center of intellect ?  Has there been any scientific study done to prove that like Brain, Heart also has intelligence and there are heart-signals just like we have brain-signals ?  What is the current state of our understanding in this regard?
I am not a biology student so finding it difficult to find a relevant reference. 
Thank you very much for your answers and comments.

A:

The heart is not a center of intellect, it's a multi-chambered pump made primarily out of muscle. 
There are however "heart signals", at least in a sense. The Sinoatrial Node is a specialized group of cells in the heart that produces regular action potentials across the cell membranes in the heart (causing the contractions that pump the blood) but this isn't an intellect or anything like that, just a regular cycle that provides the heart's sinus rhythm (essentially the "default" heart rate), the bodies autonomic nervous system (via the release of different chemicals) can influence the rate of these action potentials to raise or lower heart rate.
