Q:

What are some mRNA vaccines, other than COVID vaccines, that are widely used?

From what I've read, COVID vaccines belong to mRNA vaccines category.
I read in the above article that mRNA vaccines act in a different way than traditional vaccines.

[..]Traditional vaccines stimulate an antibody response by injecting antigens, an attenuated virus (weakened or harmless virus), or a recombinant antigen-encoding viral vector (carrier virus engineered to have antigens) into muscles. These antigen-containing ingredients are prepared and grown outside the body.

In contrast, mRNA vaccines introduce a synthetically created fragment of the RNA sequence of a virus into the vaccinated individual. These mRNA fragments are taken up dendritic cells – a type of immune system cell – by phagocytosis.[14] The dendritic cells use their own internal machinery to read the mRNA and produce the viral antigens that the mRNA encodes.[..]

My question is: are there any known mRNA vaccines, other than COVID vaccines that have been widely adopted by any country (e.g. as part of the national vaccination program)?

A:

There are no other mRNA vaccines with an allowance for use yet. There have been promising tests before COVID-19 though. See this review article:
