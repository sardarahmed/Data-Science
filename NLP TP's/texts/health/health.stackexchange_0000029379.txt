Q:

Is there a medical term for the thickness of the human torso, as measured from its back to its front?

Let's say that you took the measurement of how thick a person's torso is; specifically, by measuring between the following two points:

the skin on their chest, slightly above the navel

to

the skin on their back, just outside the spine

This is NOT a measurement of hip or waist circumference, or of how wide across someone is at the hip or the waist Basically, imagine making a measurement between the points indicated in the two circles below.

This measurement provides a rough way to extract hip circumference from hip diameter, since a cross-section of the human trunk/torso region can be approximated as an ellipse.
Google gets plenty of studies on how thick certain organs are, or how wide a person is across the hips, but none about this specific bodily dimension.
I Googled "front-to-back width", "torso thickness", "how thick is the human body", etc., and also tried to figure this out via adding up the depth of the abdominal cavity, the diameter of the spine, the thickness of the skin, etc.
Is there a medical or clinical term for this type of measurement?

A:

Sagital abdominal diameter is measured:

after a normal expiration while in the supine position with bent knees on a firm examination table and without clothes in the measurement area (Fig. 1)... at the level of iliac crest ... as the distance between the examination table up to the horizontal level, allowing the caliper arm to touch the abdomen slightly but without compression.

Figure 1 from Ris√©rus et al:

This is different than the measurement you are proposing, but in general measures the front to back diameter of the abdomen. It has been previously used to estimate visceral fat content.
