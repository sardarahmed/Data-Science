Q:

Does Mederma for scar removal really work?

I've heard both good and bad things about Mederma. 
They claim to be the most recommended product (by doctors and pharmacists) for scar removal but my dermatologist said that there's no scientific study that supports them and that dermatologists usually don't recommend them.

A:

From what I found they may have some benfit on the appearance of scars. But the info available is contradictory. 

It is featured in a article on ncbi.nlh.nih.org called: Snake oil for the 21st century

A comprehensive evidence-based review on the role of topicals and dressings in the management of skin scarring

Two randomised studies by Draelos in 2008 (n = 60) and 2012 (n = 44),
  following shave excision of seborrheic keratoses, concluded that
  MedermaÂ® improved the appearance, signs and symptoms of the healed
  wounds compared with untreated controls [42, 43]; however, both these
  studies note that funding was provided by the manufacturer Merz
  Pharmaceuticals.

As for the Amazon product I cannot find where it was sponsored or approved for safety.
