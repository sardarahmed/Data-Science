Q:

Should I be worried about rat bite

There is a wild mice that usually enters the house from somewhere and gnaws the skin from foot. It usually gnaws when we are sleeping. It is not a pet rat. It's a wild one. Is there any disease that can be caused by this?

A:

Yes. There are a number of diseases that can be transmitted by rodents, and several of them can be quite serious. This is the list of diseases that can be directly transmitted by rodents according to the CDC:

Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome
Lassa Fever
Leptospirosis
Lymphocytic Chorio-meningitis (LCM)
Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever
Plague
Rat-Bite Fever
Salmonellosis
South American Arenaviruses (Argentine hemorrhagic fever, Bolivian    hemorrhagic fever, Sabi√°-associated hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan
  hemorrhagic fever)
Tularemia

This is not to say that any given rat or mouse might transmit any of these. Other factors come into play, such as which diseases are endemic to the area and which diseases infect which species. On the link above you can expand each disease to see which rodents can transmit it. Unfortunately, rats and mice are included in most of those diseases.
