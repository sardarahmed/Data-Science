I've heard that it has antioxidant properties which can fight the virus infections and it's used as a natural remedy for a number of health problems.
What are the health benefits of consuming it (oligonol)?

A:

Possible Risks
This study suggests that Oligonol is safe for consumption and does not pose any proven threats or harmful consequences to health (1 & 2).
Possible Benefits: 
Other studies suggest that its benefits may include reducing:
visceral fat (5),
the risk of mental degenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's (6), stress-induced inflammation (7),
and excessive sweating (8).
There's also possible correlation with strengthening the immune system (9).
Disclaimers (Thanks JohnP!)

These studies don't suggest that Oligonol is a panacea, but rather
indicate possible benefits.
In many of them, there are the same scientists cited as authors.

Up Chemical Co., Ltd. - (A biotechnology company that produces nutraceuticals and functional food ingredients.)

Oligonol is a particularly promising source of
  polyphenols since it provides higher concentration of phenolic
  monomers and oligomers, and thus the bioavailability of these
  polyphenols are higher, with potential for enhanced beneficial health
  effects.

The use of Oligonol to produce an antioxidant benefit in human beings
  needs to be studied in future clinical trials.
