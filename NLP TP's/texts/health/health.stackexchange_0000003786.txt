Q:

When dettol turns white, what does it indicate

Sometimes when I bathe or clean wounds with dettol, It upon contact turns white almost instantaneously. Does it mean there's some kind of microbes or something ?. If so what causes it it turn white ?

A:

Dettol upon contact with H2O turns milky like white. 
When H2O is added to the dettol liquid its oil droplets become suspended in the water droplets, creating something called an Emulsion. 
It is that state of emulsion that causes the colour to change with its response to light.
