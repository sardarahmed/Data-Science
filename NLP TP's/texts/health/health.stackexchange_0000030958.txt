Q:

Where, in the human skin, would lidocaine cream stop but lidocaine injections won't?

In some medical procedures lidocaine is injected and in some others it is topically administered as a cream.
Histologically speaking, where, in the human skin, would lidocaine cream stop but lidocaine injections won't?
Epidermis? Dermis? Hypodermis?

A:

The depth of topical lidocaine penetration is time-dependent (for the amount of time it is on the skin).
In one study they found that with topical lidocaine placed on the skin for 90 minutes, the mean maximum depth was 5mm, and lasted ~240 minutes.
The depth of epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis vary depending on which part of the body. Could you be more specific as to which part of the body, and for how long(the cream would be on for)?
