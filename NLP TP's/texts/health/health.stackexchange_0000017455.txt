Q:

How soon will a person die if they are hung upside down?

Sorry if my question is too silly or is in the wrong place.
How soon will a person die if they are hung upside down?

A:

This is an interesting research question from both pathophysiological and historical perspectives:

"Upside-down death - the pathophysiology of inversion." Kirsty Andrews. Pathology. 2014.
Historically, deaths occurring in a head-down position were generally associated with inverted suspension inflicted upon the victim as a form of torture. In the current day, deaths occurring due to an inverted body position are rare and are usually the result of freak accidents which often attract media attention due to the unusual nature of the death. Occasionally an element of inverted suspension is present in deaths occurring in motor vehicle incidents when the vehicle rolls, coming to rest on its roof with the unconscious victim left suspended upside-down by the seat belt.

Early research indicated that inversion-related death would take "some hours" in healthy individuals.

"Death in a head-down position." Burkhard Madea. Forensic Science International. 1993.
Dying 
  in 
  a  head-down 
  position 
  is 
  rare 
  and 
  autopsy 
  may 
  reveal 
  no 
  morphological 
  findings 
  which 
  explain 
  the 
  cause 
  of 
  death 
  sufficiently. 
  Functional 
  changes, 
  mainly 
  postural 
  changes 
  of 
  circulation 
  must 
  be 
  considered 
  to 
  explain 
  the 
  cause 
  of 
  death. 
Case 
  histories 
  on 
  deaths 
  in 
  a 
  head-down 
  position 
  are 
  rare, 
  but 
  the 
  problem 
  may 
  be 
  of 
  increasing 
  interest 
  again 
  in 
  connection 
  with 
  torture 
  and 
  the 
  forensic 
  pathologist 
  may 
  be 
  asked 
  how 
  long 
  will 
  it 
  take 
  to 
  die 
  in 
  this 
  position. 
  From 
  the 
  limited 
  experience 
  of 
  some 
  recent 
  case 
  histories 
  and 
  the 
  experimental 
  investigations 
  of 
  Wilkins 
  et 
  al., 
  it  can 
  only 
  be 
  said 
  that 
  in 
  healthy 
  persons 
  it 
  may 
  take 
  some 
  hours. 

In unhealthy individuals (even adolescents), inversion-related death can be hastened by obesity and cardiovascular or pulmonary disease:

"Positional asphyxia in rollover vehicular incidents." Angela Martin et al. Injury Extra. 2010.
A 16-year-old driver with a body mass index (BMI) of 60.8 died
  after a motor vehicle collision when the vehicle went off the road and flipped over... prior to extrication
  by emergency medicine personnel he became less and less
  conscious and eventually became unresponsive. He was suspended
  in an inverted position for approximately 15 min total. He was
  pronounced dead at the scene.
Examination of the body at autopsy showed that the
  approximately 400 pound adolescent had rare petechiae of the
  conjunctivae bilaterally. The ears, nose, and lips were congested
  with florid facial petechiae. Internally, the lungs were markedly
  congested and air-filled... The cause of death was deemed to be positional asphyxia due to
  the prolonged suspension of the decedent in an inverted position,
  with a contributing factor of morbid obesity. The manner of death
  was accident.

Finally, an entire chapter of Forensic Pathology Reviews Volume 3 is devoted to this topic (emphasis mine):

"Death in a Head-Down Position." Achim Th. Schäfer. Forensic Pathology Reviews. 2005.
Based on these cases, it is observed that elderly people, and in particular elderly with preexisting cardiovascular diseases, seem to be more prone to death in a head-down position than others. This suggests that final heart failure is the cause of death rather than cerebral or pulmonary dysfunction. Results from human and animal experiments and observations under true and simulated microgravitational conditions confirm this assumption, suggesting that a prolonged, markedly elevated burden of work for the heart because of increased volume load in an inverted body position eventually leads to death by heart failure. Other mechanisms, such as suffocation (“positional asphyxia”), reduced blood reflux to the heart attributable to vanishing of blood in the venous system, decreased oxygen supply to the brain after reduced arteriovenous pressure difference, and carotid sinus or baroreceptor reflexes, as well as other factors, seem to play only a minor role, if any, in deaths in head-down position.
