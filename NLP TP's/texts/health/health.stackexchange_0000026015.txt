Q:

How do neurosurgeons drill into skull without damaging the brain?

I stumbled upon some videos showing real brain surgeries and noticed how the surgeon often uses a hand-held drill to create a hole in the skull (for accessing the brain). This made me wonder:
How does the surgeon ensure that the drill doesn't drill deeper than they want, thus damaging the brain?
For example, just from drilling holes in wood, I know that at the moment the wood is completely punctured through, the drill jerks forward deeper into the hole (since my hand is still applying a force forward, and my reaction time isn't quick enough to stop my hand immediately after the wood is completely punctured). What prevents this from occurring during surgeries?

A:

The drill is a specialised device and not a standard type of drill. It is called a trephine, which is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone to relieve pressure beneath a surface in situations such as a subdural haematoma.
In the earlier days, the risk of damage to the brain was down to a combination of skill of the surgeon and luck. Since 1950, there have been trephines with motors or shafts which automatically stop when in contact with soft tissue.
