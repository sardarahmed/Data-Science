Q:

Is eating dirt good?

A while back, I my parents knew a family who had a son. His parents believed in some weird thing that if you eat dirt, your immunity will increase and you will be less prone to sickness. However in my opinion, I think this is a very stupid thing to do, as all sorts of stuff could be in the ground, ranging from garbage to toxins. Aside from that, is there any benefit to eating dirt? Is it worth it?

A:

According to Dr. Sera Young of Cornell University, the most likely of the theories is that eating mud protects the body from pathogens, parasites, and plant toxins. It's suspected to be due to the clay's ability to bind things â€” perhaps the clay is binding the toxins before they can make you sick. This theory would explain why children and pregnant women are the most common dirt eaters; they are the most susceptible to illness. Clay may even have properties that protect against malaria.
