Q:

Heart Sound Samples

Does anybody have helpful sources/links that are basically recordings and playbacks of heart sounds (normal/ abnormal/ etc.) that I could just listen to while in my spare time? I am looking for something outside of Youtube.
Thanks

It covers:

The normal heart
Interventricular septal defect
