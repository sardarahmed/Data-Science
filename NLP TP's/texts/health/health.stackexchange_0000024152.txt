Q:

How does refeeding syndrome cause pitting edema?

In the answer to "How do you feed a starving person in a way that won't kill them?", it is mentioned that refeeding syndrome can cause peripheral edema. How does this occur?

A:

During refeeding syndrome (RFS), intake of carbohydrates causes a massive surge in insulin levels, leading to electrolyte abnormalities. Increased insulin also caused sodium and water retention independent to changes of renal GFR and RPF [1]. Water retention increases capillary hydrostatic pressure, leading to peripheral edema.
Another possible contributor to peripheral edema during RFS is hypoalbuminemia, which decreases capillary oncotic pressure [2].
