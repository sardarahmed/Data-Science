Q:

Cola in soft drinks?

Cola is a plant that is known to be of appreciable health benefit. It used to be sold in pharmacies and probably still is. 100 years ago somebody hit upon the idea of using it in a soda drink, leading to widespread use today. But is there still cola in today's "colas"?

A:

The early coca-cola recipies (the first "cola") contained extract from the coca plant, and thus contained small doses of cocaine up until 1903 where cocaine was replaced with caffeine from the kola nut. However, nowadays the kola nut has been replaced with other sources of caffeine (mainly synthetic caffeine) and flavorings in most colas.
You should certainly not expect health benefits from any cola since the copious amounts of sugar outweigh any potential benefits from trace amounts of kola extract that may be found in some exceptional colas even today.
