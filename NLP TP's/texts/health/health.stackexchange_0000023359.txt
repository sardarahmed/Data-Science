Q:

Why did countries initially presume that detecting COVID-19 requires a deep nasal swab?

According to a recent paper:

To validate the use of saliva for                           SARS-CoV-2
  detection, we tested nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from confirmed 
  COVID-19 patients and self-collected samples from healthcare workers
  on COVID-19                     wards. When we compared SARS-CoV-2
  detection from patient-matched nasopharyngeal               and saliva
  samples, we found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity
  and      consistency throughout the
  course of infection. Furthermore, we report less variability in
  self-sample collection of saliva. Taken together, our findings
  demonstrate that saliva is a                           viable and more
  sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and could enable at-home
  self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale
  SARS-CoV-2 testing.

This made me wonder... why did countries initially presume that deep nasal swabs are the default route for detecting the virus? Why didn't we start out with basic saliva samples and then try out invasive sampling, rather than the other way around?

A:

From the paper you linked to

nasopharyngeal swabs are commonly used in respiratory virus diagnostics

So clearly it was preferred for Covid-19 because of the "received wisdom" from other respiratory virus illnesses. (To pick a random example, the 2005 WHO guidlines for avian influenza don't mention saliva samples, but various kinds of swabs and washes (for the upper respiratory tract): nasal swab,
nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasal wash, throat swab.)
If you want to ask why saliva sampling is not a method more widely used (instead of, or, in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs) in other respiratory virus diagnostics, modify your question according (incl. tag).
