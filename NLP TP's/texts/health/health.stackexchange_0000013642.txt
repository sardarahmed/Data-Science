Q:

What is the medical term for a scab?

Google will not help get me to a definitive answer based on my search terms. What is the proper medical term for the crust that forms when blood coagulates? Also, is it different for different parts of the body or internal vs. external?

A:

You'll likely get a response that "eschar" means "scab".  This is incorrect.

Understanding Why the Term "Eschar" is Incorrect
What differentiates this term? Factors such as the dermal layer involved (location) and wound type it is associated with.  "Eschar" is a medical term that describes necrotic (dead) tissue found within a full-thickness wound.

"Sanguineous Crust" would be a precise medical term for "scab".
