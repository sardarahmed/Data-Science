Q:

Daily dose of recommended water

Here (https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-much-water-should-you-drink) it says to drink four-to-six cup of water.
I find it weird that they don't mention how big the cup should be? How many liters should the cup contain? 0.2L?
I've seen other places mentioning cups. So what size are cups assumed in such cases?

A:

A cup is a non-standard unit of measurement for volume:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_(unit)

It usually varies between 200ml and 250ml.
In the U.S., it is 2.365882365 decilitres exactly (which is 236.5882365 millilitres exactly).
