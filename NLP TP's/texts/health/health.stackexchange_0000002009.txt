Q:

High level of Vitamin D,1,25(OH)2, Total

I recently got blood test results and they say 
Normal Range, High level of Vitamin D,1,25(OH)2, Total = 18 - 72 pg/mL

but my level is 
96

I was researching this and found that it can be due to supplements, but I am not taking supplements with Vitamin D.
I stay indoors a lot, except to commute to work via public transportation.
I am unable to find out what else can cause high level of Vitamin D.
Any ideas?

A:

This could be linked to your diet, but Vitamin D is not found in many foods (with the exception of fish and fortified foods). However, there have been some reports that laboratories may be producing an incorrect value. 
"This means that compared with the actual concentration of 25(OH)D in a sample of blood serum, a falsely low or falsely high value may be obtained depending on the assay or laboratory used."
