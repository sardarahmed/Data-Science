Q:

Vibrator side effects

I'm curious about side effects of vibrators because I see a lot of women, who can't have sex with men in reality. They decide to use vibrators as a solution. So I would like to know is there any side effects for using it? 

A:

The literature regarding the use of sex toys in women is sparse.
I have found two studies, which describe potential side effects related to the use of sex toys in women:

Transmission of sexual transmitted disease due to the use of uncleaned and shared penetrative sex toys
Higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis
Vaginal irritation and trauma in forceful insertion or when lubricants are not used
Allergies of the vaginal mucosa to the sex toy (depending on the sex toy's type of material)

Above mentionned side effects can be prevented by thorough cleaning of sex toys (or use of condoms), use of lubricants and selection of the sex toy's material.
