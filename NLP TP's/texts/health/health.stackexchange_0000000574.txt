Q:

Why is it recommended to not expose plastic water bottles to sunlight?

Is there any substance that is released when the sun or some other heat source heats a plastic bottle (e.g. PET)? Are these substances dangerous to human health?
A note about materials: I don't know the differences between PET and other kinds of plastic like polycarbonate, so if there are any differences regarding exposure of different kinds of materials (used for food and beverages) to sunlight, please feel free to add as much information as you feel is useful to advice about human health.

A:

If talking about the container itself and the chemicals it might leave on the product being consumed then these fears are mostly related to the fact that BPA  (bisphenol A) is present in poly-carbonate bottles and on the adverse effects this has on the brains and development on reproductive organs of mice.
However, when compared and related to humans, the effects don't seem to be that devastating to human health, see: http://www.bisphenol-a.org/whatsNew/20080205.html
