Q:

How mutable is SARS-CoV-2 virus?

As it commonly known, mutability is a fundamental characteristic of viruses which presents the ability of virus genome to adapt to physical circumstances, prevent and circumvent vaccine effect and to cover more ranges of carriers, animals and people categories.
COVID-19 belongs to RNA-viruses family, and RNA viruses is known to be very mutable, but how much this is true for COVID-19? How much in comparison with other viruses? I didn't found any reliable researches in this field except this expatiative article from EpiVax.

According to their research, this virus has little-to-zero T-epitopes cross-conservation which makes it very difficult to build a vaccine. Am I right?
What interests me more, is the mutability of the virus. Now mostly aged people are subject to fatality with this virus, but might the situation change later?

UPDATE: this question becomes especially acute and well-timed in light of recent revelations about SARS-CoV-2 is being transmissible from people to cats, from people to tigers, from people to dogs, and from cats to cats.
The study made by researchers at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute in China proved the susceptibility of ferrets, cats and dogs to virus. Are there sny more species susceptible? 

A:

There has been at least one phylogenetic study of 48 near complete samples of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
