Q:

Dentistry notation symbols

Unicode's Miscellaneous Technical block encodes a bunch of dentistry symbols:
⎾⎿⏀⏁⏂⏃⏄⏅⏆⏇⏈⏉⏊⏋⏌

It looks like the first and last two are used in Palmer notation. What are the rest of them used for? What do the circle, triangle, and tilde mean?

A:

According to Dental Computing and Applications, in Chapter XVII on Unicode Characters for Human Dentition,

A triangle with a bar indicates an artificial spacer, especially on a denture, a circle with a bar indicates a supernumerary tooth, and a tilde with a bar indicates an abbreviation for a group of teeth.

It also says that this is notation used by the dental insurance claim system in Japan.
