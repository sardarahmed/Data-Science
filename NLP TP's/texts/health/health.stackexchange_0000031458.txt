Q:

Does less histamine in receptors mean less appetite?

I have found this text:

when the histamine receptor is blocked, lowering metabolism. These biological changes result in increased appetite, overeating, slower fat breakdown and weight gain. Antihistamines can also make you feel tired and unmotivated to exercise.

A:

That's not how receptors work. Receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, etc. convey some biochemical signal. The strength of histamine signal is given by the presence of available receptors (i.e., those that aren't blocked) and the concentration of histamine.
Blocking the receptor or reducing histamine have generally the same effect: less of that biochemical signal. Histamine isn't "metabolized" when it binds a receptor, it just binds for a bit and then floats away (perhaps to bind another receptor somewhere else).
The H1 histamine receptor specifically is a G-protein coupled receptor with downstream signaling through phospholipase C and IP3. This can have all sorts of downstream effects in different cell types, including changes in gene expression.
