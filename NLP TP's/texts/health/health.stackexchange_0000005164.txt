Q:

High Risk Of Death When Contracting Hepatitis A After Contracting Hepatitis C

Is it true that there is a high risk of death if one contracts Hepatitis A after they contract Hepatitis C?  If so, you'd think there ought to be more noise about this in health publications and also in the media.

A:

In Fulminant Hepatitis Associated with Hepatitis A Virus Superinfection in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C, out of 17 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who also got infected with hepatitis A, 6 died, so about one third. 
In an Italian population based study, 77 patients with chronic hepatitis C (52 with hepatitis C, 25 with hepatitis C and hepatitis B) also got infected with hepatitis A. None died from the hepatitis A infection. This is a published letter to the journal the first study appeared in - the researchers from Italy wrote in because they were surprised by the high mortality rate in the US study, as they had seen no such correlation. 
Hepatitis A virus vaccination in persons with hepatitis C virus infection: consequences of quality measure implementation pooled data from 10 studies and puts the mortality rate for hepatitis C patients with a hepatitis A superinfection at around 7 percent (95 percent confidence interval: 1.24-42.12) 
That figure of 85 percent dying that the TV show House MD mentioned is made up. 
Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended for chronic hepatitis C patients by 

the World Health Organization
the CDC 
and the NHS
