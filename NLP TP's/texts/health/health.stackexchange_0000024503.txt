Q:

Does fascial interposition significantly improve vasectomy success when mucosal cautery is the method of vas occlusion?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC406425:

Fascial interposition significantly improves vasectomy success when ligation and excision is the method of vas occlusion. A limitation of this study is that the correlation between postvasectomy sperm concentrations and risk of pregnancy is not well quantified.

Does fascial interposition significantly improve vasectomy success (i.e., azoospermia and no recanalization) when mucosal cautery is the method of vas occlusion?

A:

https://www.auanet.org/documents/education/clinical-guidance/Vasectomy.pdf as the table comparing some occlusion techniques with and without fascial interposition (FI):

Compare the row #2 (without FI) against the rows #1 (with FI) and #3 (with FI): the use of FI seems to have decreased the upper bound of the failure rate. Note that the study was published almost 10 years ago so I'm hoping some more recent and more rigorous studies have been published since then.
