Q:

Does a Parkinson's Disease always reach the final stage 5

There are five stages of Parkinson's Disease (according to https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-stages/ for instance)
Are there exceptions or do patients always reach the last stage (5) - assuming they live long enough ?

A:

Parkinson's is a progressive disease 1, so in general it's going to progress through all the stages eventually for most patients, but there are very few things in medicine you can say "always" happen (except maybe that exceptions always happen).

Although Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is progressive and worsens over
  time, it is highly individual and affects people differently. Not all
  people who have PD will experience all the symptoms, and symptoms may
  vary in their severity between patients. Different people experience
  progression at different speeds, as well.

So the answer to your basic question is no, stage 5 is not a guaranteed outcome for every patient who lives long enough. It is, however, a likely outcome.
