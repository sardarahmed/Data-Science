Q:

What is the average optimal time interval before or after a meal when medicines should be taken?

Many medicines and supplements specify that they should be taken either before of after a meal—and I know that this means some time must pass, not gulping the med immediately next to the meal. However, I've never heard any general recommended durations between the meal and the medicine, other than vague handwavey numbers—and instructions define it only for a few medicines that seem to differ from the usual. Since I and many other people keep taking vitamins and whatnot, it would probably help to set any kind of average optimal durations, that I could put into my phone's timer app instead of the arbitrary interval with which I came up so far and which could easily be too long or too short.
Foreseeing the nitpicking: I sure know that ‘it varies’ depending on both the medicine and the person's metabolism and food habits. Still, any science-supported numbers would be better than nothing at all, which is what I have now. And if I judge my metabolism to be faster or slower than the ‘average’, I can adjust the duration myself—or perhaps a range of intervals could be defined, for lifestyles from active to sedentary. As for the medicine, I'll be glad to see the manufacturer's opinion in the instruction.
Previous research effort: was looking for this on the web on-and-off for months, found bupkis.

A:

I asked a real doctor, and the answer is thirty minutes.
