Q:

How to restore mouth PH balance after lime soda?

Squashed lime soda is my favorite drink. And I usually combine it with coffee. I recently learnt the drink creates an very low, acidic pH level in mouth which can cause tooth enamel to decay and expose teeth to plaque. Is there anything I can consume after the drink, which would restore neutral PH balance to my mouth?

A:

Water is typically pH neutral at around pH7. Sometimes you can also buy bottled varieties with a more alkaline character so something closer to pH8. Now there's a basic chemical reaction called neutralization. In essence, all you have to do is rinse your mouth with water several times to neutralize the acid.
