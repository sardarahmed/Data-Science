Q:

Can skin creases caused by obesity or exacerbated by poor posture be corrected?

Deep skin creases in people with obesity are common. When weight loss occurs, skin folds are reduced but the creases remain. The same seems to be true of creases deepened by poor posture.
What can be done to reduce or eliminate skin creases? Does aloe vera help?

A:

Creases form all over your body. Once they do, there is really very little that can be done for them. If you doubt this, consider how much money is spent on cosmetic surgery every year just for facial creases. They can be filled with collagen or other substrate, they can be stretched, the muscles around a crease can be relaxed, decreasing the depth of the crease (this is how botox works), but the crease is there.
Very fine creases (or wrinkles) can be diminished by contact irritants (e.g. retinoic acid preparations, vegetable acids, and other preparations) which cause mild edema (stretching the skin) and reactive skin changes which in toto reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
Obesity normally causes deepening of normal skin folds and the creation of deep skin folds from superficial ones (for example truncal-abdominal skin-folds.) Once this process occurs, the structure of the skin itself is irreversibly changed. If very prominent (for example after weight loss in the morbidly obese), surgery can be done to remove the excess skin and the fold itself (but a scar will replace it).
Aloe vera will not help. However, moisturizers may diminish their appearance a bit, as will good posture.
