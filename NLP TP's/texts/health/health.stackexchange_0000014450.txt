Q:

Fibre <= carbs always true?

I bought a big brand bag of dry roasted peanuts the other day. Delicious.
Recently I've been trying to understand nutrition, especially in relation to diabetes. I was under the impression that sugar, starches, and fibre were all carbs.
If this is true, which I think it is, then why does the back of said peanut packaging say there is more fibre than carbs?
Is my understanding incorrect or else what's going on?
Here's the evidence:

A:

The label on the picture is wrong. Both fiber and sugar belong to carbohydrates, so sugars (5.1 g) + fiber (8.6 g) = 13.7 g carbohydrates, but the label says only 7.2 g. 
According to NutritionData, 100 g of dry roasted peanuts contain:

4.2 g sugars
8 g fiber
21.5 g carbohydrates

The 9 g of carbohydrates that are not specifically mentioned is starch.
