Q:

What can I do to minimize the chance of tooth pain?

A tooth in the rear left of my mouth (I think it's my wisdom tooth) has temperature sensitivity; if I eat something very cold and I chew it with that tooth, it begins to hurt. 
Due to some problems with my insurance, I can only get an appointment in mid February. From experience, I know that eventually the tooth will start to hurt by itself witouth any stimulus. My question is, what can I do to delay this stage of pain as much as possible? Should I brush my teeth an excessive number of times a day? Should I floss around that tooth often? Should I use mouthwash? Of course this is generally good advice, but I am afraid that since the cavity is so close to the nerve already, excessive brushing of teeth may help the bacteria dig towards the nerve faster.
EDIT: Perhaps I should mention, my tooth has had temperature sensitivity for 3-4 weeks already.

A:

To minimize the chance of tooth pain, assuming that your tooth has a cavity, i.e. dental caries, you must: 

avoid sugar: sugar is metabolized by oral bacteria generating acids,
hence pain
avoid acidic beverages and foods, like lemons 
avoid food or drinks too warm or cold
avoid to put anything in the tooth, as aspirin or anything else

Brush twice a day with a soft toothbrush and using fluoridated toothpaste (>1.000 ppm of fluoride)
Now, if the pain is transitory, i.e, you drink something cold and you feel the tooth, but as soon as you stop to drink the feel stops, in such case you will be fine. 
If, otherwise, the pain prolongs even if you retire the stimulus, or start to hurt during the night, then you must go ASAP to a dentist.
