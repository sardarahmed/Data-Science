Q:

What are some natural ways to reduce blood pressure?

What are some natural evidenced based approaches that can be used to reduce blood pressure in a patient with hypertension, or prevent hypertension in an otherwise healthy patient?

A:

Walking

Several studies have been done on the effects of walking and high blood pressure
One Korean study1 had 23 men with hypertension; they found that taking a 40 minute walk helped to reduce the blood pressure in the test subjects

Eating2

Avoid salt (sodium) because it puts higher strain on your blood vessels, which raises your blood pressure
Eat fruits and vegetables (apples, bananas, grapes, broccoli, carrots) because they contain potassium, magnesium, and fiber, which all help to control blood pressure, and they are also low in sodium
Other good foods to eat are nuts, legumes, and poultry

Relaxation3

Stress is an indirect cause of high blood pressure; sometimes people cope with stress by doing unhealthy things like smoking or eating junk food, which can raise blood pressure
Meditation is a great way to reduce stress
Get more sleep
