Q:

Rodents falling from the ceiling at Chipotle restaurants, what to do?

Assume that rodents (i.e. rats) steal part of your food and there is a norovirus outbreak.
With respect to norovirus, I think there is not much I can do to "prevent" myself from catching the illness; e.g. I can't inspect my Chipotle burrito and go, "ah ha! there's the norovirus right there on my tomatos!"
But with respect to rats falling out of the ceilings, I would like to know what kind of food safety precautions I should adhere to.  
My question is:  If rats eat part of my food, can I simply scoop away this part and then eat the rest of my food?  Or is it not advisable to eat any of the food?
Is there like a "5 second rule" that I can follow?

A:

You actually need to ask this question? If rats are falling on your food in the restaurant then they're running amuck in the kitchen eating and crapping on your food. So the answer is:

Find the manager
Demand a refund
Leave
Report it to the health department
