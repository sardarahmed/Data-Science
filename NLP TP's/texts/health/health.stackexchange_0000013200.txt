Q:

Is There Any Point In Getting Lab Tests Done If I Can't Find a Primary Care Physician?

I've been seeing a therapist for depression and I've been requested to get a physical done so I can have my vitamin D, testosterone levels and thyroid checked. Unfortunately I live in a rural area where there are not nearly enough doctors and I have exhausted all efforts to try to find a primary care physician to establish myself with. It's gotten so bad our local insurance provider has stopped fielding phone calls asking for support finding a primary care physician.
It's been suggested to me by several offices to get the tests done that I need at our local Urgent Care center, which I can do, but... what happens if they find something that needs treatment? I do not have a doctor. What would possibly be my next step in that situation?

A:

Then the physician at the urgent care center will either treat you or refer you to someone who can. Just because it's an urgent care center doesn't mean the physicians there don't have a duty to act or can't provide followup care. In fact, in an area like yours with a shortage of doctors, I would imagine they're accustomed to situations like this and handle it routinely.
