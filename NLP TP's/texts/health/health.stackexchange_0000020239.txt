Q:

Are type 2 hypersensitivities autoimmune diseases?

I'm learning about hypersensitivities and it seems to me that all type 2 hypersensitivities are autoimmune diseases; also all examples of type 2 hypersensitivity I've heard so far are also classified as autoimmune diseases (Grave's disease, Myasthenia gravis etc.). However, couldn't find any explicit mention that all type 2 hypersensitivities are autoimmune diseases. Is my assumption correct?

A:

No, not all type II Hypersensitivities are autoimmune diseases.
Example: blood transfusion reactions, erythroblastosis fetalis, are also type 2.. but these are not autoimmune.
Type 2 indicates reaction between antigen and antibodies..
Auto-immune means antibody acting against own body cells..
That's why all type 2 is not autoimmune..
