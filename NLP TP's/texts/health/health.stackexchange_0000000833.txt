Q:

What are the natural ways to increase the blood pressure?

My BP is 87 by 69 as I post this.
Is there something which I can consume daily in a certain amount to keep my blood pressure normal?
Or are there any other ways to increase the blood pressure naturally?

A:

If you're saying that you have a low blood pressure and you're seeking to reestablish a phisiological value I would answer you that low blood pressure it's not a disease unless it's really too low, but this is something you should clarify with your doctor. Also, if there's a disease, you should first cure the causes instead of lookin for functional foods to use as they were pills (="I have X, I eat Y for this"). Again this is something to check with doctors.
If you're asking which foods have the power to increase blood pressure, I would answer: salt1, liquorice2. Then I suggest you to check a link that might be useful.
