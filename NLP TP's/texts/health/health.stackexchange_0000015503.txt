Q:

Why is the Rotavirus vaccine can be given only until the age of 8 months and 0 days?

Any idea why there is such a strict age limit for this vaccine? Reference

A:

World Health Organization: Age restrictions for rotavirus vaccination: evidence-based analysis of rotavirus mortality reduction versus risk of fatal intussusception by mortality stratum,2012, page 5

WHO currently recommends that rotavirus vaccines should not be
  initiated for infants aged 15 weeks or older, with all doses being
  completed by 32 weeks.  These age restrictions are driven by
  concerns about intussusception risk. Natural intussusception rarely
  occurs before 3 months of age and the incidence increases 10-fold
  between 3 and 6 months of age.

*Intussusception is a type of bowel blockage.
