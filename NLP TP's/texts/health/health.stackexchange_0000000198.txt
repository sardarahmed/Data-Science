Q:

Naturally improve eyesight

Is there a possibility to improve the deteriorating eyesight naturally? If yes, how is it possible? If the eye sight continues to get worse, is there a chance of losing eyesight completely?

A:

Ps:myopia is condition your cousin is having most likely.
children's bodies grow, so do the eyes, which may cause a gradual increase in myopia. And just as bodily growth can be in uneven spurts, the changes in myopia may be similarly uneven. During adolescence, the change can be rather rapid and require a new, thicker eyeglass correction more than once a year, but when body growth slows or stops (usually by age 18), the myopia tends to stabilize. There is normally no reason to worry about the frequent changes in lens correction that occur during adolescence. Almost never is there any real danger to eyesight, and vision can almost always be corrected to 20/20 or better with eyeglasses or contact lenses.
Note: There is an extremely rare type of myopia, called malignant progressive myopia, which is a serious condition and leads to gradual structural damage to the eye. This type needs regular clinical evaluation. It is not related to ordinary myopia and does not develop from ordinary myopia.

For your cousin, it may be the correct time for his eyeball to stop growing . Ask him to do check up regularly. 
If it still continues, ask him to check his doctor. 
Balanced diet is recommended to prevent further deteriorating of myopia aka distant vision problem, esp vit A. 
It is an irreversible process, you can't bring his power back to normal naturally 
But you can go for lasik surgery, but I don't recommend it personally. .  It has its own line of complications
