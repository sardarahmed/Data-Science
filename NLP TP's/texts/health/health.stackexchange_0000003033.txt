Q:

How much mercury is contained in sea salt?

Eating fish means eating mercury in meaningful quanties. The EFSA advocates for that reason against eating tuna every day.
If I buy sea salt, does it also contain mercury? Is so how much? Is it a meaningful quantity such as tuna?

A:

In general, the answer seems to be no, it does not contain a meaningful quantity. Refer first to this answer in Seasoned Advice. 
Although not peer reviewed, this article appears to be a credible source and it's the only documented direct test for mercury in sea salts that I've seen. Refer to Table 3 (Hg is mercury).
