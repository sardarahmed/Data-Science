Q:

COVID-19 disinfection with ultraviolet

Even CDC site does not seem to mention uv as a method of sterilization.

The only authoritative source of uv disinfection of COVID type virus I found was in 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14631830'. But it does not mention the most effective wavelength or a duration. Can somebody point me in the right direction?
If 1 hour of appropriate UV exposure is sufficient to eradicate it, can head safety shields be reused after that period of time of exposure? I understand there might be limited # of cycles that polycarbonate shields can be reused, since the plastic will loose some transparency after repeated exposure.
Can UV exposure be used for face respiration soft masks (N95 or plain) for disinfection?

If this has been covered here already - I'll remove.
EDIT1: Actually Franck's reference to Why aren't we sterilizing n95 masks?
is relevant. Mark's answer does mention UV sterilization, but does not provide authoritative link/ref.
So, the other question of UV use for covid-19 sterilization of face shield is still open.

A:

From {1}:

[The SARS-CoV-2 virus virus] will be killed by UV, estimated survival in direct sunlight is 10% after 2–3h exposure

90% of flu virus dies after 6h sunlight at spring equinox (3/21) at Bay Area latitude (Pubmed 17880524).
Coronaviruses are 2–3x more sensitive to UV than flu virus (Pubmed 16254359)

Regarding:

Can UV exposure be used for face respiration soft masks (N95 or plain) for disinfection?

See Why aren't we sterilizing n95 masks?
