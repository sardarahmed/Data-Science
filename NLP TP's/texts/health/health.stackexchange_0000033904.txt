Q:

Area unit for mmHg pressure

Atmospheric pressure is stated as 14.7 pounds per square inch (square inch is the area unit).
When mmHg is utilized, what is the area unit?
For example, if blood pressure is "120", does that mean 120 mmHg per square millimeter?

A:

My physics is a bit rusty, but the equation for pressure of a liquid is

p = ρgh

where rho is the density, g is the local gravity and h is the height of the column of liquid. As you can see from this equation, the pressure of liquids is independent of the area underneath it.
So whether you built a mercury manometer with cylindic base of 1cm2 filled with Hg or a cylindic base of 1dm2, the amount of height that the liquid rises due to increased pressure stays the same.
Wikipedia states that

[b]ecause pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid
The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height h and density ρ is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation p = ρgh, where g is the gravitational acceleration. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely.

A:

As per Narusan's answer, it's an artifact of the method of measurement from using a column of mercury in a curved vacuum tube.
Equivalent of 7.50062 mm of mercury is 1 kPa, or 0.150 psi or 10 millibars.

A:

When looked at dimensionally, "mmHg" as a pressure measurement is "cubic millimeters of mercury per square millimeter".  Basic dimensional analysis says that you can cancel your volume with your area, leaving only a length.
