Q:

Sutures - do they go through the muscle as well?

A suture is a stitch or row of stitches holding together the edges of a wound or surgical incision.
In the case of deeper cuts, for example, a cut on the back of the thigh, an inch deep and long from knee to heel, does a suture only bring together skin or does it also go through muscle?

A:

Thanks to Vance-L-Albaugh for clarifications.
For deep cuts, sutures bind the subcutaneous tissue to allow it to heal properly. Since muscle lies beneath the subcutaneous tissue, it seems that sutures do NOT include muscle for lacerations.
However, if you want to generalize to any suture, then the first two articles below demonstrate instances where muscle might be sutured. The two links are tests of comparison between different types of methods and techniques in suturing on muscle.
