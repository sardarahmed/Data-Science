Q:

Have there been any studies on how long COVID-19 remains infectious on various types of cloth?

I was thinking common items like wool and cotton clothing. Has any one  discovered yet how long COVID-19 remains infectious on clothing?  I have seen the usual items such as paper boxs, stainless steel and plastic. Almost all my searches get hits on these but it ends there.
Clothing remains illusive thus far. 

A:

This study looked at various surfaces including cloth which was not otherwise specified.  They stated it lasted 2 days.  Other studies have said 3 days for plastics so if you have natural or synthetic clothing, then in the circumstances that the study looked at ( 65% humidity and ambient temperature of 22C ), you can expect 2-3 days on clothing.

We further investigated the stability of this virus on different surfaces. Briefly, a 5 μL droplet of virus culture (∼7·8 log unit of TCID50 per mL) was pipetted on a surface (appendix p 1; ∼cm2 per piece) and left at room temperature (22°C) with a relative humidity of around 65%. The inoculated objects retrieved at desired time-points were immediately soaked with 200 μL of virus transport medium for 30 mins to elute the virus. Therefore, this recovery of virus does not necessarily reflect the potential to pick up the virus from casual contact. No infectious virus could be recovered from printing and tissue papers after a 3-hour incubation, whereas no infectious virus could be detected from treated wood and cloth on day 2.
