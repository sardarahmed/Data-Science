Q:

How did I not get Mono?

Two months ago I hooked up with a girl who said she had a cold (let's ignore the stupidity on my part there). The next day she said she went to the doctor and told me she had mono. Naturally, I prepared for the worst because I heard that mono has a 5-6 week incubation period. About 6 weeks later, I was still feeling fine and went to the doctor to get tested. Mono tests came back negative.
How is it possible that I didn't get it? 
Is mono always inevitable or is it possible to beat it with a solid immune system and not become infected even if one is directly exposed?

A:

Mononucleosis is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus, but other viruses such as cytomegalovirus can cause it as well [1]. EBV is a really common infection, and it's very likely that you've been exposed at an early age without developing serious symptoms[2]. If that's the case, you wouldn't be infected by a person with active mononucleosis.
