Q:

Is Imiquimod 5% cream (US brand: Aldara) helpful as an adjunctive treatment of a facial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) prior to a Mohs surgery?

I wonder whether Imiquimod 5% cream (US brand: Aldara) is not helpful as an adjunctive treatment of a facial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) prior to a Mohs surgery. Helpful in this context means 1) Reducing amount of cells removed during Mohs surgery 2) Reducing recurrence likelihood.
The closest study I could find so far, a published in 2009 {1}, concluded:

Imiquimod 5% cream was not helpful as an adjunctive treatment of nodular, nasal BCCs before Mohs surgery, but a larger study might show a benefit. Clearance of nodular, nasal BCCs treated with imiquimod prior to Mohs surgery was less than described in previous studies. Nasal BCCs may be more resistant to imiquimod treatment. Local inflammatory reactions limit imiquimod's usefulness in this setting. Histologic assessment of nasal BCCs treated with imiquimod is recommended.

4 limitations:

Small sample size (12),
Published over a decade ago,
Focused on nodular BCCs, whereas I also wonder whether it helps for superficial BCCs too (in the case where imiquimod didn't fully treat the BCC),
Focused on nasal BCCs, whereas I'm interested in other part of the face (forehead).

Is Imiquimod 5% cream (US brand: Aldara) helpful as an adjunctive treatment of a facial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) prior to a Mohs surgery?

A:

The 2018 systematic review {1} whether Imiquimod 5% cream (US brand: Aldara) is helpful as an adjunctive treatment of a facial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) prior to a Mohs surgery. Summary: Two studies show it is beneficial, and one shows it wasn't but that's unlikely because they looks at nasal BCC, which tends not to respond well to Imiquimod 5% cream. Quote from {1} with more details:

Some of the literature explores the option of pretreatment
with imiquimod 5% cream before Mohs surgery. In one
study, a total of 70 adults with primary nodular BCC were
identified, with one group given imiquimod 5% cream for
4 weeks prior to Mohs and the other treated only with Mohs
surgery. It was found that there was less of an increase in
tumor size and area from baseline, fewer Mohs stages, and
shorter reconstruction times in the group given neoadjuvant
imiquimod [22]. Another study used reflectance-mode
confocal microscopy as well as histological imaging to confirm
decreased tumor burden with the use of 5% imiquimod
cream used before Mohs excision. When two, four, and six
week regimens were tested in comparison to vehicle cream,
the four and six week regimen groups showed significant
reduction or clearance of tumors with confocal microscopic
findings that paralleled histologic diagnosis [23].
Of note, one study was found to have different findings. In
this study, a total of 31 patients were followed. Some applied
imiquimod cream each night for 6 weeks and underwent a
4 week rest period prior to having Mohs surgery, while the
others underwent only Mohs surgery. No differences were
found in the number of Mohs stages, tumor sizes, or costs
between the two groups. In the treatment group, 5 of 12
remaining patients were confirmed on histology to be clear
of tumor. In this study adjunctive imiquimod 5% cream
before Mohs surgery was not found to be useful in treating
nodular BCC, in fact the clearance of the nasal nodular BCC
pre-treated with imiquimod before Mohs was less than what
had been found in prior studies [24]. However, compared to
other studies, this study had a smaller sample size. Furthermore,
this study specified nasal BCCs, which may respond
less to imiquimod therapy.
