Q:

Is non-smoked nicotine a smoking cessation-aid?

I understand it is a consensus that in general, daily and along the day active smoking of anything (as well as passive smoking) is health damaging.
Teeth damage, lung damage, and complications are, as far as I know, the most likely problems from active, addiction based, cigarette smoking (of say, a pack a day).
I recall searching evidence for the usage of either nicotine tablets or tobacco capsules as smoking cessation aids but finding pretty much nothing.
Doing so might substitute mouthholding Swedish tobacco sackets (Snus) which as I understood can help avoiding (but not necessarily ceasing), smoking.
Edit after answer: I know people also use gums but I never came across usage of tablets or capsules instead gums.
Is non-smoked nicotine (especially in the form of nicotine tablets or capsules) a smoking cessation-aid?

A:

Yes, nicotine replacement therapy is used in multiple forms, including a skin patch and oral dosing with gums and lozenges.
The purpose is to help avoid the side effects of nicotine withdrawal, while delivering nicotine at lower doses than is obtained through smoking, to help manage craving and eventually stop smoking entirely.

As far as the delivery mechanism, nicotine undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism in the liver. This could make it harder to dose, because you would need to give 3-4 times the sublingual dose to get the same plasma concentration, and because individual differences or drug interactions might make the extent of first-pass metabolism variable and unpredictable between individuals.
