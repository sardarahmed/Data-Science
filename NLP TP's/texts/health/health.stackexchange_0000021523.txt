Q:

If I get COVID-19, can I get cured by myself?

Suppose I get infected by COVID-19.
I am a healthy person but with weight issues, according to the standard weight tables. 
Can my immune system cure me by itself? That is, without the need of medications or drugs? and by only resting and eating healthy?

If you’re young and healthy with only mild symptoms, your doctor will likely advise you to isolate yourself at home and to limit contact with others in your household. You’ll likely be advised to rest, stay well hydrated, and to closely monitor your symptoms.

If your symptoms worsen with home care, it’s important to get prompt medical care.

Here, Why could symptoms worsen?

A:

If you’re young and healthy with only mild symptoms, your doctor will likely advise you to isolate yourself at home and to limit contact with others in your household. You’ll likely be advised to rest, stay well hydrated, and to closely monitor your symptoms.

This means that if you have mild symptoms, yes, you will eventually "cure" yourself, the same way you would recover from a typical common cold, or how a healthy individual would typically handle influenza.

If your symptoms worsen with home care, it’s important to get prompt medical care.

This means if you have bad symptoms, then home care is not enough, and you need the assistance that a hospital can provide. There is still no cure that medical care can provide; instead, the purpose of getting care is to prevent your symptoms from killing you before your immune system can handle the infection on its own. For some this includes mechanical ventilation: using a machine to help you breathe.
