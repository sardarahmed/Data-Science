Q:

Is amyl nitrite used for sex?

Do people use it for sex somehow? What is the effect? Just in the book,"Fight Club", the author describes this drug in a sex related context.

A:

Amyl Nitrite

Treats and prevents chest pain (angina pectoris).

And more pertinent for the question:

On the street, this medicine and others like it are sometimes called
  "poppers." They have been used by some people to cause a "high" or to
  improve sex. Use in this way is not recommended. Amyl nitrite can
  cause serious harmful effects if too much is inhaled.

Poppers are a name for inhaled nitrites which Amyl Nitrite is one of the most common. They can be lethal if used recreationally and cause vasodilation. 

Poppers are rapid-onset, short-acting potent vasodilators that produce
  a rush characterized by warm sensations and feelings of dizziness.
  Poppers sometimes are used to facilitate anal intercourse because of
  their actions on the anal sphincter.

I have read reports about them being similar to Viagra and having a psychedelic effect. I have also included the Wikipedia link.
