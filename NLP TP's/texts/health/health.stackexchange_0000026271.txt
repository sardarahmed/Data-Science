Q:

Determining levels of Phenylalanine in common foods

As a result from my recent concerns regarding Phenylketonuria, I would like to ask the community:

Where can I find the quantities of Phenylalanine in common
nutritional items such as milk, eggs, cheese, nuts, soybeans, chicken,
beef, pork, beans and fish?

I am aware it may vary between producers but I am at a loss when a label only states contains phenylalanine (without mention to the amount). Would there be a resource available for researching the levels that occur naturally?

A:

OK, it seems this is more what you were asking for:
