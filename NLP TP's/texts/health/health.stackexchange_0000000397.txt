Q:

If I think my mole is changing, what should I do?

If I think a mole has changed, or my partner thinks they have noticed a change, what should I do about it? Is there any way of finding out for sure if a mole has changed?

A:

Get to a doctor or dermatologist straight away
A changing mole is an indicator of possible melanoma. Melanoma spreads very quickly, and mortality rates rise fast if it is left to grow.
Here is some information on what to look for, and potential indicators of melanoma (UK NHS).

Melanomas usually appear as a dark, fast-growing spot where there was not one before, or a pre-existing mole that changes size, shape or colour and bleeds, itches or reddens.

A specialist will be able to do a diagnosis, and advise you on future checks. If they think it could be a melanoma, they will remove the mole and perform a biopsy.
