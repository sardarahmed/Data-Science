Q:

Why is there no hepatitis F?

There is hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, and G. Why did they decide to skip F? All I can find online is that there is no hepatitis F virus, but that doesn't explain why there is hepatitis G and not hepatitis F.

A:

A virus isolated from rare blood samples was believed to be able to cause hepatitis, and this virus was designated as the hepatitis F virus. (Source: MedicineNet)

Further investigation has failed to confirm the existence of this virus. There is no known hepatitis F virus.

For more information on the candidate Hepatitis F virus, see Fagan & Harrison (1994).
