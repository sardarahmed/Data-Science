Q:

Can mold in a building cause fatigue?

Pretty much what the title says, can mold in a building cause fatigue? 
I've been working with the same company for almost 11 years. The first 2 and a half years I was at another building until they moved my department to another one. My health at that building was never in question, didn't seem like anything effected me at all.
I know ever since coming into this building my allergies started getting worse and my sinuses would bother me really bad as well. Literally I could walk into the building and my eyes would turn bloodshot red because of whatever is in the building.
Lately when I've been coming into work, I feel so tired/fatigued after being in the building for about 10-15 minutes or so, and it doesn't go away. I know they found mold in the building before when they stripped down the wallpaper. 
Can mold in a building cause fatigue?

A:

Yes, it's certainly possible that there is mold or other agents in the building that can be either causing or contributing to allergy and fatigue symptoms.
Here is a writeup on what is called sick building syndrome (SBS) from National Health in the UK. Here is a writeup on various agents that can cause the same symptoms from a doctor's blog. There is a similar malady titled "tight" building syndrome as well. SBS can produce the following symptoms:

headaches and dizziness
nausea 
aches and pains 
fatigue
poor concentration   
shortness of breath or chest tightness 
eye and throat irritation

There are quite a few different writeups on SBS and mold related fatigue, and they all seem to indicate that there can be significant health effects from things such as poorly cleaned and/or designed ventilation systems, agents in the carpet/walls, etc. I would highly encourage you to pursue this and get it cleared up.
