Q:

What are those white things in my juice & can it cause me any harm?

So i got this white weird condensed things into my juice once i added some milk into it & i got worried whether it is a normal thing or can it have some risk on my health ! Is this a safe juice & what can cause this? 

A:

Fruit juice is acidic, and acid makes milk curdle. This is the end result. It's harmless. It's pretty much just juice-flavored cottage cheese.
