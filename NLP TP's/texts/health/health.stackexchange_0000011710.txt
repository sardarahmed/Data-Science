Q:

I'm scared of certain celestial objects

I have a huge fear of photos of certain things in space. Here's a list:

Nebula
Galaxies
Planets
I am not scared of photos of stars (like the sun or distant stars), galaxy or star clusters (far away enough so the galaxies are not too large, like this one: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Heic1401a-Abell2744-20140107.jpg/800px-Heic1401a-Abell2744-20140107.jpg)
I am also not scared of comets
Asteroids are not very frightening, only a little bit

When I look at photos of these, my heart begins to race. I have a book with these photos in it and I can not look at it in bed or I fear I will have nightmares (I have had nightmares of me flying through space before).
Is there an explanation / name for a phobia similar to this?  Thanks!

Welcome to Health SE!
Astrophobia
I did a Google search for [ fear of space ] and looked at what appeared. I think that your phobia is called "astrophobia". See, for example, this Wiktionary definition.
Causes
You can try a Google search, and look at some of the results, to learn why phobias develop.
Treatment
Like all phobias, and like all other anxiety disorders, your fear is treatable. See here.
If it's only a tiny problem, maybe you can treat yourself; post a new question asking how. Or you can pay a psychologist the full hourly rate to do the treatment.
If it's a bigger problem (e.g. if you're a primary-school teacher who's just been asked to teach an astronomy unit to your students), your medical insurance will likely cover the treatment. See your doctor.
