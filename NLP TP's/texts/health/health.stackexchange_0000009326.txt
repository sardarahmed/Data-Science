Q:

Has anyone sucessfully gained weight?

I have been to many doctors, all of them said "It is your biotype." or "There is nothing wrong with you, but if you want you could take Whey Protein".
I would like to know of people that were considered skinny and successfully gained weight.

A:

1. You gain weight by consuming more calories than you spend (National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute).
2. If you just consume more calories and you do not start with resistance training, you will convert most of the excessive calories into the body fat rather into bigger muscles, so you will appear fatter (skinny fat) and not "bigger," more muscular, stronger or better looking (Nutrition.gov).
3. Your maximal muscle mass is genetically determined (PubMed)

Skeletal muscle is a highly heritable quantitative trait, with
  heritability estimates ranging 30–85% for muscle strength and 50–80%
  for lean mass.

You can increase your muscle mass to a certain point with resistance training but not beyond what your genetics allows you.
4. According to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (the content available only here), there is no cause-effect relationship between whey protein consumption and muscle mass gain, strength or endurance.
