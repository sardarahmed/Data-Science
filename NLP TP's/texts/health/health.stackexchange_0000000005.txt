Q:

Can the immune system break down anything?

Every time one takes a pill, drinks a glass of wine, or uses an illicit drug, it is understood that the effects are temporary. Caffeine only keeps one awake for a few hours, alcohol only intoxicates for a few hours, aspirin only staves off a headache for a few hours. This is because the immune system breaks medicines down, and when they're entirely gone, so is the effect.
So can the body break down anything?
The assumption is that the body remains alive long enough to finish breaking down (or not breaking down) the substance.

A:

Actually, in the case of most drugs, it has nothing to do with the immune system per se. Generally, drugs are either chemically modified (often in the liver) to make them inert, or excreted (either in the urine or the stool) thus removing them from the body. When the liver or the kidneys are not working properly, drugs fail to be excreted or digested, resulting in accumulation, which may be toxic.

A:

Certainly not.  By definition, it cannot break down poisons (at least not quickly enough) to stop the body being harmed or killed.  In addition, it can not break down (or "neutralize") many radioactive substances.  A famous example of this was the murder of Alexander Litvinenko:

On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalised. His illness was later attributed to poisoning with radionuclide polonium-210 after the Health Protection Agency found significant amounts of the rare and highly toxic element in his body.
