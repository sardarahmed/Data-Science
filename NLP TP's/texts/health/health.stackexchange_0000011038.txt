Q:

Turmeric vs Ibuprofen

Is there any truth in what is said here, that Ibuprofen is toxic to heart muscle and turmeric is an effective alternative?  I have tried to find the study mentioned but cannot find it.

A:

Let's look up Ibuprofen up in a reliable source. We can read there that:

Cardiovascular Risk
Increased risk of serious (sometimes fatal) cardiovascular thrombotic events (e.g., MI, stroke). Risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use. (See Cardiovascular Thrombotic Effects under Cautions.)
  Contraindicated in the setting of CABG surgery.
GI Risk
Increased risk of serious (sometimes fatal) GI events (e.g., bleeding, ulceration, perforation of the stomach or intestine). Serious GI events can occur at any time and may not be preceded by warning signs and symptoms. Geriatric individuals are at greater risk for serious GI events. (See GI Effects under Cautions.)

This tells me enough, this is a drug that should not be used unless there is no other viable alternative with less side effects. Depending on the dose and duration of the treatment, you have to consider using a drug to protect your stomach. I would leave making that decision to my doctor. 
Turmeric, in contrast, does not have side effects. We can read here that  the claims of it helping to reduce inflammation are not supported by strong studies. It may work, but it's not going to have a very strong effect on the short term similar to powerful painkillers, otherwise the evidence of its efficacy would have been clear. However, if someone stops using Ibuprofen and starts to use turmeric and is able to tolerate not using Ibuprofen, then the simple act of stopping to use Ibuprofen is a good thing. Whether turmeric itself works or not doesn't matter all that much.
