A:

Call your psychologist and ask for such option if you can get the e-mail, because you would like to explain your situation in writing.
If they don't have, you can explain your situation on the paper either handwriting or on the computer and print it before going to the appointment.
Especially when it's a private psychologist, they'll love to read what you've written to understand better your situation. In public clinic usually they've tight timeframes. But it may all depend on the specific psychologist and their approach, some of them would want to assess your situation by the direct approach.
Even when they wouldn't want to read it, it's worth to print such document just for your self (even if it's just a mind map), so you won't forget any details what you wanted to share.
If you looking just for online psychologist, I'm sure you can write to them as you like, whether via e-mail, chat or web forms. Search online for some, then send the message explaining your situation and find the most suitable for you who can understand your problems and can help you.
