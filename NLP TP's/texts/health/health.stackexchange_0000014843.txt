Q:

Limited amount for drinking water?

I got a toothache few days ago and since holidays were here the dentists didn't work.
It hurt day and night and the pain was extreme but luckily for me I figured out that cold water helped me.
I drank a LOT of water; about a glass every minute.
I was going a lot to the bathroom but my stomach didn't hurt.
I didn't know humans can drink that many water.
So what is the limit (gallons or liters) for drinking water and what happens if you drink more than the limit?

A:

Drinking too much water can lead to water intoxication, but

For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water

(according to Wikipedia). Another article has information about the exact amount:

Healthy kidneys are able to excrete approximately 800 millilitres to 1 litre of fluid water (0.84 - 1.04 quarts) per hour.[12] However, stress (from prolonged physical exertion), as well as disease states, can greatly reduce this amount.

Water intoxication may lead to

headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness.

and in the end, it even

is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions

Every substance is potential poisonous, it just depends on the amount. It's not likely you will get water intoxication from combating a toothache.

Water probably helped for you because it cools your teeth; an alternative could be  using an ice pack. Even though you're not likely to suffer from water intoxication, it might save you a few trips to the restroom.
