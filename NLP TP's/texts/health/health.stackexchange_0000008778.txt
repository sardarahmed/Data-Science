Q:

how does alcohol damage the brain?

I am constantly reading about how alcohol affects mostly the liver and secondly other organs and body functions as well as causing vitamin deficiencies, but I did not find much information about the brain.
Could you elaborate on how exactly alcohol consumption, either chronical or infrequently affect brain functions both in the middle and in the long term especially when drinking ultil getting drunk?

A:

When drinking alcohol, the small water-soluble ethanol enters the bloodstream and moves around till it reaches the brain. Since it is a small molecule, it enters the blood-brain barrier and passes between brain cells (neurons) interfering with the neurotransmitters of the nervous system.
Ethanol causes the release of Dopamine (Happiness Hormone) and stops Glutamate (a neurotransmitter that normally excites neurons) and this makes the brain slower and the person calmer and sleepy.
