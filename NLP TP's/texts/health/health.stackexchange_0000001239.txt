Q:

How to cure eczema on my foot?

I am suffering from dry eczema on my foot over the past 6 years. I used moisturizing creams and pills as prescribed by skin specialists. As a result, I got a cure which was just temporary. It came over again.
I also made a paste of neem tree leaves and applied it on the affected skin. But still pus discharge has not stopped. Normally I used to wear flip-flops or leather sandals.
Now the real problem is, I have to wear formal shoes with socks to my workplace. How can I get a cure to this, or atleast, How can I prevent the pus from spreading over? Please help 

A:

Firstly is it definitely eczema and is it only eczema?
The discharge of pus suggests a bacterial infection (probably staphylococcal). Now this could be superimposed on eczema (which causes the skin barrier to break down causing an infection) or simply just a skin infection/abscess. Either way, if it really is an infection this usually requires antibiotics. Thus you should see a doctor.
If it is eczema, once the infection is treated:

Self care techniques - is there a trigger? Avoid it and avoid as much as possible the compulsion to itch
Steroid creams - these reduce the inflammation and are very helpful
Moisturising creams - these maintain the skin barrier. Use them for a long period of time even when the skin looks completely healthy
