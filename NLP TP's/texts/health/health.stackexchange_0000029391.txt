Q:

What is a person called before he is a patient

I am working on COVID related app. There is a scenario when I need to collect details of person who wants to have COVID tests. I want to show a label on the app whose meaning is: Details of a person who wants to have COVID test.
So, I want to know the term for a person who wants to have COVID test. I searched through google but cannot find an appropritate word. So, I thought I should ask it here.
Please forgive me if this a very basic question, and please inform me if I missed some information in my question.

A:

There isn't an English word that means pre-patient. If you call a doctor's office and ask for an appointment, you become known to them as a patient the minute they type your name into the system. It doesn't matter that they haven't seen you, examined you, or run any tests yet; you're still a patient. That's what I would expect your app to do. Anything else would likely be confusing.
