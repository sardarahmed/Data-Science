Q:

How do hospitals decide whether to reopen elective surgeries during this COVID-19 pandemic?

Many hospitals have cancelled or postponed elective procedures due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. What kinds of considerations are ethics committees making when deciding to reopen elective procedures or keep it closed?

A:

A lot of hospitals are not currently performing elective surgeries because:

Operating rooms and PACUs (post-anesthesia care units) have been converted to take care of patients with COVID
Staffing shortages due to reassignments to COVID-related units
Shortages of PPE (e.g. gowns) that are needed to perform surgery
Unnecessary risk of coronavirus transmission to staff and patients performing/receiving these procedures and surgeries

You can review these considerations in recent guidance by the American College of Surgeons in the section titled "Why are surgeries being postponed?".
Hospitals make a substantial amount of their revenue from procedures and surgeries, and they have a financial incentive to perform them. They will decide to perform them based on the availability of 1-3 (space, staff, equipment) and their own balancing of the risk of virus transmission (some may prioritize revenue, others may prioritize safety).
