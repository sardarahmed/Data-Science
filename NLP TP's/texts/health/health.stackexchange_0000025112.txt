Are there any scientific studies about the effects of them for a healthy person at different ages?

Regarding NMN: study {1} shows it is safe to use on humans, but no study yet on the efficiency in terms of lifespan increase. Studies on NMN have been on other animals. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide for some references.
Regarding the efficiency of resveratrol in terms of lifespan increase, see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Resveratrol&oldid=981556075#Lifespan:

There is insufficient evidence to indicate that consuming resveratrol has an effect on human lifespan.

FYI:  Is there any downside in combining the ingestion of NR and NMN supplements to increase one's level of NAD+?
