Q:

Interpretation of Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) in health economics

To the health economists in the crowd: Does anyone understand the following passage from this article?

For the first analysis with fixed costs and outcome rates, using the
$250 and $350/sample cost, there was an increase in the QALYs with
ICER ranging from $47K-$97K depending on the 5%,10% or 15% admission
reduction over SOC.

What puzzles me is that they report an ICER in USD whereas ICER's should typically be in units of USD/year.
In other words, how should one interpret that sentence if one is interested in the cost savings (independently of the variation in admission reduction)?

A:

Let's just consider the $250 intervention and 5% reduction in hospitalization.

For the models, we assumed a 90-day window for 1000
inpatients and outpatients with cirrhosis.

The authors simulate 2000 total patients for 90 days.

Health utilities assigned were 1.0 for staying alive without admission/LT, 1.0 for LT, 0.5 for admission and 0.0 for death.

From Table 1, we can learn that with just the standard of care, the 2000 simulated patients would live 1760 quality adjusted life years. Some of them would be hospitalized, making their year of life "worth" half as much. Some would have died, being worth zero.
If there are 2000 patients and they are implementing a $250 intervention it would cost $500000. From Table 1, we can see that they estimate $1200000 in decreased hospitalization / transplant costs (1200000-500000=700000). With that intervention, they assert the simulated patients would experience 11 additional quality adjusted life years.

With the standard of care, the 1760 QALYs cost $61400000, $34886/QALY. (something-something rounding)
With the intervention, the 1771 QALYs cost $60700000, $34274/QALY.

In the methods, they note:

We calculated QALY (quality of life years) and Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). ICER is defined by the difference in cost between two possible interventions, divided by the
difference in their effect. It represents the average incremental cost associated with 1 additional unit of the measure of effect.

So, the $250 intervention cost $700000 less and made 11 QALY.

$700000/11QALY = 63636 â‰ˆ 65902 (more something-something rounding)

So they assert that they would save the health system approximately $66000 per quality adjusted life year by implementing the $250 intervention.
So, overall, the authors assert that their intervention not only would make the the population healthier, but that they also saved $700000 over 90 days across 2000 patients. That's $350 per patient.
