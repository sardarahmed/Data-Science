Q:

"Copay with deductible" vs. "Copay after deductible"

Pertaining to health insurance, what does "Copay with deductible" mean, in contrast to "Copay after deductible"?
I get "Copay after deductible" -- you must pay for the service fully out of pocket until your deductible is met, after which you must only pay the copay amount and the insurance pays for the rest.
So what does "Copay with deductible" mean?

A:

I had the same question and found the following on CMS.gov:

This cost-sharing option means the consumer first pays the copay, and
  any net remaining allowed charges accrue to the deductible.

A:

I've been looking at their plans too, and wondered the same thing. I called Sendero today at 844-800-4963 and the rep told me that it means the same thing as "after deductible". She said once you've reached your deductible, then you only pay the copay.
