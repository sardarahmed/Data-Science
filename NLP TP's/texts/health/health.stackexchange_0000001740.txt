Q:

What kind of doctor or physician do I need to consult for continuous coughing?

I have a dry cough. It's persisting from last few months ( more than 3 months). There is no chest pain. Slight cold environment causes me urge to cough, irritation happens inside the chest. I have consulted a ENT(ears, nose, and throat) doctor, but he doesn't seem to guide me well. He asked me to take an antibiotic and cough syrup for all this time, but I don't see any relief. What kind of doctor or physician do I need to consult for my case?

A:

Dry cough is most often non-inflammatory. If you had a flu or influenza prior to the beginning of the symptoms, then you might suffer from something post-viral. It is usually self-limiting. (Wikipedia)
The fact that cold air provokes your symptoms might be indicative of asthma. As such, you may need to see a pulmonary specialist. Certainly he/she run some basic tests like a chest x-ray for a starter. Spirometry is also the routine test to be performed.
