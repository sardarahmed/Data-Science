Q:

How our brain discharge old CSF?

Our brain produces new CSF fluid every hour, so old CSF discharge from our body.
My question is where is CSF discharge point? or how our brain discharges Old CSF from the brain.
.
There is a complete guideline of how we eat, and how its discharge. How new blood cell create and how dead cells discharged.
But i didn't ready anywhere, How our brain discharge CSF, where is its main point?

A:

After CSF flows through ventricular space into the subarachnoidal space it is absorbed into venous stream through Arachnoid granulations.
My first one-line answer =)
