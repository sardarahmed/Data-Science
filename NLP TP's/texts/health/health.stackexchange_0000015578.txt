How does a typical electromyography result report look like?

How does a typical electromyography result report look like?
I'm not asking for usual values: I simply wonder what kind of graphs or tables I should expect that summarizes the results observed during the electromyography.
If it depends on the muscles being tested, I am most interested in the upper limb muscle group, and especially the biceps, triceps, deltoid, brachioradialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, FDI, and APB.

I am asking the question as I'm going through the electronic medical record of a patient who got a nerve conduction study + electromyography, and I cannot see any data (tables/graphs/…) pertaining to the electromyography. The only information regarding the electromyography is a pithy 2-line text going through the results. I wonder whether the electronic medical record  is missing the electromyography results.
For example, for a nerve conduction study, a typical result reports would contain, for each location, the latency, the amplitude, the distance and the velocity in both table and graph form:

The report template below
  is based on the AANEM’s educational paper Reporting the
  Results of Needle EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies. A report
  template helps the EDX physician adhere to and document required
  procedures —by checking them off a list. This process will help the
  EDX physician complete a thorough analysis of the patient’s history,
  physical, and EDX data that will improve diagnostic accuracy and
  result in quality patient care. The template also will help laboratories
  applying for the laboratory accreditation program meet the criteria
  used to evaluate EDX reports. The template was developed listing
  the key elements for a EDX standard report excluding F-wave,
  H-reflex, and repetitive stimulation studies. Physicians are strongly
  urged to utilize this template to improve their reports.
