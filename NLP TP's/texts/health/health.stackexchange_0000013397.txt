Q:

Mental disorders are documented in the DSM, how are other medical conditions documented?

Is there an official database of medical illnesses/conditions?  Is it publicly available?
When a patient's information is entered in the medical record software, does the software cross-reference the patient's data (age, gender, symptoms) with known illnesses/conditions?
If not, why not?  It seems like WebMD was trying to be this sort of database, but it relies on self-assessment.  I feel like a feedback loop from medical professionals (to constantly update/improve the database's matching ability) could fine-tune the definitions of certain conditions (based on measurable data points), and improve diagnosis accuracy.

A:

Not sure if this is what you are after but there is the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). The current one is ICD-10 http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/icdonlineversions/en/
