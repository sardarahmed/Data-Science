Q:

Calories composition and weight loss

My question comes after having read this  article.
Let's take a Person A and suppose the needed amount of calories for A is 2500 Kcal.
Now suppose A wants to limit the amount of daily calories to 2000 Kcal.
Given 2 diets (just as an example) of 2000 Kcal divided as follows:

50% from proteins, 30% from carbohydrates and 20% from fats
50% from fats, 30% from carbohydrates, and 20% from proteins.

Will the outcome be the same (I.e., weight loss in the same way) as stated in the article? 
Ignoring the bad health effects of a diet with a wrong equilibrium how the composition does not matter if only considering weight loss?

A:

Macronutrient (carbs, proteins, fats) composition of a diet does not have a significant direct effect on weight loss.
Comparison of Weight-Loss Diets with Different Compositions of Fat, Protein, and Carbohydrates (PubMed, 2009, a randomized clinical trial involving 811 overweight adults)

Reduced-calorie diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss
  regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize.

On the other hand, certain macronutrient compositions and forms may be associated with increased satiety (and hence lower food intake):

Solid, compared to liquid carbs (PubMed, 2011)
Foods high in fiber, such as whole-grain pasta, compared to refined-grain pasta (PubMed, 2016)
Foods high in viscous soluble fiber, such as whole-grain oats (PubMed, 2016)
Low-carb, high fat diets (PubMed, 2016)
