Q:

Can Helicobacter pylori be transmitted through saliva?

I was wondering if you can get Helicobacter pylori (the bacteria that can cause gastritis and ulcers) by kissing a person,   if that person is infected with it?

A:

The mode of transmission of helicobacter is unknown but studies show that people with helicobacter infections may have it also in their saliva. So, in this study, 75% had helicobacter identified by molecular Probes.

This has lead to some people saying that transmission by saliva is common.
