Q:

What causes a gravelly voice in young children?

Why would an (otherwise healthy) young boy have a permanently gravelly voice for his whole life?
Both this article from a prominent children's hospital mention a wide variety of causes. Another less formal article, but also from a highly reputable children's hospital mentions some causes, but none that could explain a life-long condition.
Since we're talking about a life long condition, and no known trauma to the larynx, it seems reasonable to assume that a physiological abnormality is at play.
What physiological causes would be among the most common?

A:

As you stipulated no trauma and it has been lifelong, the first link you provided says that it could be down to

Vocal cord paralysis

Patients can be born with a weak vocal cord or develop weakness with movement of the vocal cords from a nerve injury. The patient will often have a raspy voice that is weak or breathy.
