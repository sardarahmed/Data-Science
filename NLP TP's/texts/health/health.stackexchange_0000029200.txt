Q:

Are vaccines much more deadly than people (and scientists) think?

In the response to the question Are Covid-19 vaccines much more deadly than people (and scientists) think? is mentioned that "Docs are instructed not to report deaths after a flu vaccine that are unlikely to be vaccine related since those vaccines have been given over many years without problem".
This was put me to think that if maybe the probabilities are like just 20% of it being the vaccine then it will no be reported. So suppose a group of risk with members 10 000, are vaccined with a vaccine. And 10% die, then if all of them have a risk factor of 10% of die by vaccine it will never be reported, and we will never know that the vaccine have a probability to kill of ~0.1% (Given the example it would have killed 100 persons).
So this could have been masked thousands of kills by vaccine?

A:

we will never know that the vaccine have a probability to kill of ~0.1%

Very unlikely given that randomized trials with thousands of participants have been conducted; one meta-analysis pooled 41,141 patients but "None of the included trials reported any cases of vaccine-associated mortality".
