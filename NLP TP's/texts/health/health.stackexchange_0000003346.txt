Q:

Which background color is better for eyes while working on computers for a long time?

I am a Software Engineer, so as such I use a computer system for more than 9 hours a day. While I am working which background color is best white or black to help avoid unnecessary eye strain?

A:

Reading is better for dark text on light background than for light text on dark background.

We investigated the underlying mechanism by assessing pupil size and proofreading performance when reading positive and negative polarity texts. In particular, we tested the display luminance hypothesis which postulates that the typically greater brightness of positive compared to negative polarity displays leads to smaller pupil sizes and, hence, a sharper retinal image and better perception of detail. Indeed, pupil sizes were smaller and proofreading performance was better with positive than with negative polarity displays.

Higher brightness of light background displays is said to lead to an improved detail understanding.

The findings are in line with the assumption that the typically higher luminance of positive polarity displays leads to an improved perception of detail. Source: Positive display polarity is particularly advantageous for small character sizes
