I would like a personal body scanner.
What kind of things can I buy that's legal and safe?
Is a ultrasound safe and what kind of things can it see?

A:

In the US, medical device sales are regulated by the FDA much like drugs.
Like drugs, some items are permitted for over-the-counter (OTC) sale to the public (for example, bandages and thermometers). Others can only be sold to medical professionals. Diagnostic devices that require a professional to interpret are very unlikely to be available OTC.
Other countries have similar rules according to whatever regulatory body has jurisdiction.
