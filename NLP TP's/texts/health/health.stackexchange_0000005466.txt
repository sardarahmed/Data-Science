Q:

Do computer glasses actually work?

It's very likely that I will be spending most of my life in front of a computer monitor. This is necessary for my profession and the fact that improving technology requires us to look at screens more. My eyesight is near perfect and I never needed any glasses or lenses. However, I notice that all the staring at screens takes a toll on my energy during the day and I want to protect my eyes. 
I have already altered the brightness/contrast and colour of my monitor. I also installed f.lux software on my computer.
My question is this: I came across computer glasses but opinions are divided and I wonder what is true. As far as I know there are two types: tinted glasses and glasses with a correction (I'm Dutch and I don't know the perfect translation for glasses with a certain "focus" or "correction". Edits more than welcome) I'm not really interested in the tinted version since I covered that with adjusting the settings of my monitor. My interest is in glasses with a low correction that cancels out or reduce staring. Is it safe to assume that glasses like these will reduce the strain on my eyes because they don't have to focus so much anymore?
As I already said, the opinions are a little divided. One website is positive, another isn't. Even the answers to this question say different things. One person recommends special glasses another thinks they're not helpful. 

A:

No one likes CVS, and computer glasses are said to increase contrast and decrease glare to alleviate eye stress. If you are sure you will be using the computer in the future for prolonged periods and have considerable discomfort, it will be worth the investment for eye strain relief and ultimately less magnification.
