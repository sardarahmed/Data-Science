Q:

Is Glue on Chocolate and other Wrappers Safe/ Edible?

Is the glue from the wrappers on chocolate bars (Yorkie for example) and other foods safe to eat and consume (sometimes it gets stuck on the product)? 
I tried researching but came up blank... I am also sure there was a worldwide feud about this not long ago but can't seem to recall any findings from it.

A:

It can be trusted as safe as much as the regulations that it comes under can be trusted to make it safe and producers following said regulations.  

Materials and articles that come into contact with food must comply with the rules laid down by European Regulation 1935/2004. The regulation requires that adhesives used in food packaging must not:
  - affect the food
  - make the food harmful
  - change the nature, substance or quality of the food
