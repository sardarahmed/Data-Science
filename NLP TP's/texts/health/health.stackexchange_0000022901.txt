Q:

Is there a virus from which humans can recover, but which doesn't grant long lasting immunity?

Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic I was under the impression that viruses fall into two categories:

Diseases from which you recover and afterwards become fully immune. When reinfected with a mutated version of the virus, you do get sick again, but it's a milder form. (common cold, influenza)
Diseases which are impossible to recover from (HIV, HPV), so you don't really gain immunity

Are there diseases which fall into a third bucket: you do recover, but can be reinfected immediately with the same strain? Note that I'm not asking about whether or not this is possible with COVID-19 - this question is purely about other diseases that we know of.

A:

Seasonal coronaviruses come back year after year and we continue to suffer with them

Researchers do know that reinfection is an issue with the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause about 10 to 30% of common colds. These coronaviruses seem to be able to sicken people again and again, even though people have been exposed to them since childhood.
"Almost everybody walking around, if you were to test their blood right now, they would have some levels of antibody to the four different coronaviruses that are known," says Ann Falsey of the University of Rochester Medical Center.
After infection with one of these viruses, she says, antibodies are produced but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again.

Similarly, the Herpes Zoster or chicken pox virus you recover from but when your antibody levels drop, it can reappear as shingles.
