Q:

Do drugs with the same chemical formula work identically?

As a simple example, H2O molecules are identical, but water can have three different forms (liquid, vapour, ice.) What about more complex matters, like drugs? Can they have different forms which work differently?

A:

Many drugs come in more than one form -- or formulation, I should say. For example, it's common for a drug to come in an oral formulation and an injectable formulation: same chemical, different formulation with different usages. There are many dosage forms. 
Do they work differently? Yes and no. Typically, the drug is going to exert the same general effects regardless of delivery method, but those effects are going to occur more rapidly if given intravenously than orally, for example.
A good example is menoxidil. 

Minoxidil is a vasodilator that relaxes (widens) blood vessels and
  improves blood flow.

This effect gives minoxidil two very different uses: the first is as a pill that reduces high blood pressure, and the second is as a topical ointment that can regrow hair on the scalp. The mechanism of action is the same for both purposes (increasing blood flow), but the effect is very different given the formulation. A pill affects the body as a whole and so reduces blood pressure, but the topical ointment affects only a small area of scalp so encourages hair growth in that area without having an effect on blood pressure. 
Similar examples abound.
