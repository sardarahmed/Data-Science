Q:

Fractured 2nd metatarsal near the toe - treatment options?

I kicked a wall (don't ask!) and after some tooing and froing managed to get an x ray. 
If clearly shows a clean fracture of the 2nd metatarsal near the toe, not displaced. I'll go through the NHS motions, but given it can take a while for the wheels to move I'd like to start to do the right thing. 
Would this just require an air boot support generally? Or would it be cast? I can still walk on the heel and outside edge of my foot so I'm reasonably mobile still... Any initial advice and any tips to speed up healing would be great!
Here's the x ray, right foot, oblique angle - equally, does this look like it may require surgury to place and of the fractured bones?

Edit:
If there's any obvious fracture, follow RICE - Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.
Do not bear any weight until you can see a specialist and get a diagnosis, and a diagnosis you are happy with.
Try to rest it as much as possible and keep the limb elevated above the heart as much as you can until you have professional medical advice.

In my situation:
I saw the orthopaedic specialist today. The conclusion from the x ray is that yes, it's fractured... But the "good" news is that I only have a fracture boot and can load bear on my heel as much as pain allows.
The summary is that there's a lateral metatarsal ligament that binds the knuckles of the metatarsals together, and as long as only 1 of the central metatarsals is fractured, it is in effect supported in position by that ligament and the two either side act as splints.
In that the bone is in the correct position, it'll not drop back (if more than one was fractured, the ligament would pull it back) and it'll be 3 -4 weeks before I can start to weight bear and 6 weeks should be back to ahem normal. No pins or plates required.
