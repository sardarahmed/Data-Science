Q:

Chances of contracting Lyme disease after an half hour walk through a narrow trail through woods

I walked for about half an hour through a narrow trail in the woods in shorts and a short-sleeved shirt yesterday. I am now worried about the possibility of being bit by a tick and contracting Lyme disease. I did not feel any bite or see any tick on my body nor the characteristic erythema migrans rash. But it is only one day after the walk.
What are the chances I could be infected with Lyme disease?

A:

The CDC says:

Your risk for Lyme disease is very
low if a tick has been attached for
fewer than 36 hours. Check for ticks
daily and remove them as soon as
possible.

You don't have evidence you were bitten by a tick, let alone having had one feed for over 36 hours. Without any known bite from a tick, without any signs or symptoms of a bite without noticing the tick, it does not seem the CDC would recommend you be concerned.
