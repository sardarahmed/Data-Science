Q:

Does the administration of oxygen to ischaemic patients improve outcome?

In several articles it is reported how isvhaemic (stroke) patientsâ€™ outcome Ian improved by oxygen therapy. 
How beneficial is the administration of oxygen? Are there any studies or guidelines?

A:

A large study of ~8000 patients suggests there is no real benefit to prophylactic oxygen supplementation after acute stroke (Roffe et al., 2017).
American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines (Powers et al., 2018) are for oxygen only for hypoxic patients, with limited evidence of benefit but no evidence of harm. Hyperbaric oxygen is only recommended in cases of air embolism.
These guidelines are supported by Roffe et al., 2017, but they are consistent with the guidelines prior to that study, so this is a case where a large study confirms the standard of care rather than suggesting a shift in paradigm.
