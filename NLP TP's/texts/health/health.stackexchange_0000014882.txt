Q:

Effect of training on air intake

Say we have two men, A and B, A is trained and B is not. Apart from that they have the same weight and running technique. When they both run at the same speed for 5 km does the amount of air they inhale differ?
As they both need the same amount of energy for the excercise I would think that they need the same amount of oxygen for the chemical processes in the muscles. I found studies that show that the heart rate decreases but I am not sure if this directly shows that they need less air because it could be that they can transport more oxygen per heart beat.

Eventually I found something:
Andrew, George M., Carole A. Guzman, and Margaret R. Becklake. "Effect of athletic training on exercise cardiac output." Journal of Applied Physiology 21.2 (1966): 603-608.
Porszasz, Janos, et al. "Exercise training decreases ventilatory requirements and exercise-induced hyperinflation at submaximal intensities in patients with COPD." CHEST Journal 128.4 (2005): 2025-2034.
