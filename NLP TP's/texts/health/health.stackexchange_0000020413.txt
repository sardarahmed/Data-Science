Q:

What's the typical concentration of medical oxygen?

What's the concentration level of oxygen in a standard medical oxygen gas which is normally found in ambulances or hospitals? Does it contain nitrogen too?

A:

Medical oxygen in liquid or compressed cylinders is typically >99% O2, but it is not typically administered at full strength. Instead, patients inspire a mixture of O2 and room air.
Oxygen concentrator units concentrate to 90-96%, which is called "93% oxygen". The remainder is mostly nitrogen.
