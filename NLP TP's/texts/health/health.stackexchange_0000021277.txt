Q:

Why are there disproportionate deaths from new York to Washington?

Regarding the corona virus, why are there many deaths in Washington but none in new York? 

A:

Most of the COVID-19 deaths in Washington involve a single nursing home, where the virus spread widely before being detected.
The patients at that facility are in a high-risk category for this disease due to their advanced age; there is no similar cluster of cases at a nursing facility elsewhere in the US, therefore it is not surprising that the mortality rate is quite different so far.
There is speculation that there are far more undiagnosed cases in Washington, many of which would be mild cases. Given issues and limitations with testing, it is difficult to know what the true rate is.
