Q:

How long should I stay isolated after I recover from COVID-19?

If a person gets COVID-19 and (hopefully) recovers at home without being hospitalized, how long should that person stay isolated before they can return to social interaction?

A:

The current recommendations of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) depend on whether testing is available and has been done. They offer two criteria, the first is non-test-based and the second is test-based.
For persons who have not been tested, the recommended criteria are:

Persons with COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for
  themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following
  conditions:

At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and,
At least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.

For those who have been tested, the criteria are:

Persons who have COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care
  for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following
  conditions:

Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and
Negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab
  specimens collected â‰¥24 hours apart*** (total of two negative
  specimens). 

***All test results should be final before isolation is ended. Testing guidance is based upon limited information and is subject to change as
  more information becomes available.

Keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease with many unknowns and therefore the recommendations above can and probably will change as more is learned, so anyone using this answer to make a decision should visit the CDC link I provided at the beginning of this answer before making that decision.
