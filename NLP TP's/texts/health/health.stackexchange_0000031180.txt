Q:

A swollen body organ filled with fluid

I was wondering how shall I describe one's foot, knee etc. which due to some injuries in sport has swollen and is filled with fluid.
It is most of the time painful and can cause you feel uncomfortable.
It usually restricts the range of motion. For more clarification, I have added an image to the post. Please have a look at it and let me know how shall I explain this injury in both everyday English and technical terms.
PS. As far as I am concerned, the term "edema" cannot be used in this case, while edema is not caused by an injury to a particular body tissue. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)

A:

There are a couple of terms you could use. You don't need to be technical with a doctor or anyone else.  "Edema" means (from link):

A local or generalized condition in which body tissues contain an excessive amount of tissue fluid in the interstitial spaces.

This can be one of the symptoms of a sprain, so you could be correct in using this. As noted on WebMD (emphasis is mine):

Causes of Edema:
Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area.

In this context it would be called "traumatic edema" or "post-traumatic edema", depending on the duration and state of healing of the injury. However, sprains are often also accompanied by "bruising", which is the purple discoloration you see with blood-vessel damage.
You could always just call it swelling...
