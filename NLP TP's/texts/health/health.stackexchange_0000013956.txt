Q:

Is Type 2 Diabetes reversible?

Is it possible to reverse Type 2 diabetes by using a specific diet?  What about insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes?

A:

It depends on how long the patient has been on insulin, and whether "pancreatic exhaustion" has been reached.
If the person has been on insulin only a few years when there is still endogenous insulin production ( check by doing a C-peptide test ), then yes, it's possible.
See the work by Prof Taylor at Newcastle, England using extreme low calorie diets which rapidly reverse hepatic and pancreatic steatosis, restoring hepatic sensitivity to glucose levels.

Update: The 12 month results from the DiRECT study show that 50% of the patients in the intervention arm ( The intervention comprised withdrawal of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, total diet replacement (825–853 kcal/day formula diet for 3–5 months), stepped food reintroduction (2–8 weeks), and structured support for long-term weight loss maintenance ) went into remission off all diabetic drugs.  The greater the weight loss, the more likely remission was achieved.
