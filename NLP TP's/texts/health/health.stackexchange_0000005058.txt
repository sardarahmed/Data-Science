Q:

The scientific evidence of '4-7-8' breathing trick to induce sleep

I read that a simple '4-7-8' breathing trick can induce sleep in 60 seconds

Simple '4-7-8' breathing trick can induce sleep in 60 seconds.Dr
  Andrew Weil says it works because it allows the lungs to become fully
  charged with air, allowing more oxygen into the body, which promotes a
  state of calm

But is there any scientific evidence behind this?

A:

There is no evidence:
"Despite a potential bit of miscommunication about the technique's effect on insomnia, there’s one thing I can be certain about – there doesn’t appear to be any reliable evidence that the 4-7-8 breathing method works."
