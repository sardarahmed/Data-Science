Q:

What is the difference between a percutaneous endoscopic procedure and a laparoscopic procedure?

Laparoscopic procedures and percutaneous endoscopic procedures both seem very similar, but are somehow distinct.
I can find plenty of studies comparing the outcomes of the different methods (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15937831), but I cannot find out what exactly distinguishes a percutaneous endoscopic procedure from a laparoscopic one.
What is the distinguishing factor between the two methods?

A:

Percutaneous means "effected, occurring, or performed through the skin"
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/percutaneous
The difference lies in one of the terms - percutaneous endoscopic procedure - having a more general meaning whereas laparoscopy refers to endoscopic procedures carried out specifically within the abdominal cavity.
http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Laparoscopy/Pages/Introduction.aspx
Thus a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG]  tube placement could be described as a laparoscopic procedure since it is an endoscopic procedure within the abdominal cavity via a skin incision.

Put simply laparoscopic procedures are percutaneous endoscopic procedures involving organs within the abdominal cavity
However percutaneous endoscopic procedures have applications in many other areas of the body. 
eg. Percutaneous Endoscopically-Assisted Calcaneal Slide Osteotomy
