Q:

Why can one not simply remove gallstones, not the whole gallbladder?

The gallbladder is a pouch like organ that can hold little stones that form from cholesterol and other crystals. 
When people experience pain or other complications from these stones, the common treatment is to remove the entire gallbladder and any stones in the bile ducts either through abdominal or laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery.
My question is: why can not one simply open the gallbladder, and remove the stones, then seal the gallbladder?
My question is motivated by a feeling that one should not remove an organ ( even an "unnecessary" organ as is claimed like the gallbladder ) without a good reason. So I'm wondering why I didn't read there was a surgical option for leaving the gallbladder in place, but removing the stones.

A:

According to this article from the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, 

Gallstones do not go away on their own. Some can be temporarily managed by making dietary adjustments, such as reducing fat intake. This treatment has a low, short-term success rate. Symptoms will eventually continue unless the gallbladder is removed. Treatments to break up or dissolve gallstones are largely unsuccessful.

(Emphasis mine.)
The complications of removing just a stone would probably be the same as removing the gallbladder - problems with a general anesthetic, or infections of the incision. But leaving the gallbladder there might expose you to the risk of needing the surgery again. Since life after gallbladder removal is generally reported to be the same as before, except without abdominal pain, removing just the stones would be exposing the patient to more risk (of a recurrence and possibly a second surgery) for no benefit.
