Q:

Are motorcycle helmets effective in preventing Corona?

Can a full-head helmet with the visor closed prevent getting infected by the Corona virus during a casual interaction with a carrier?
For example, when buying something at a store or discussing something with someone for 10-15 minutes.
How does it compare with the protection provided by a standard face mask (that can be purchased at a pharmacy)?

A:

It's better to use some guidelines from reputable sources rather than coming up with your own.
The WHO does not recommend masks for healthy people in most circumstances, only when directly dealing with someone infected, and in that case accompanied by careful hand washing.
Their advice for the general public as of this posting (and this is good advice year-round anyways, not only when particular pathogens are present, because influenza and viruses that cause the common cold are always present) is to wash your hands, keep a distance from people who are sneezing/coughing, avoid touching your face, and cough or sneeze into a tissue or corner of the elbow rather than into the open or your hands.

A:

I think it's a great idea. It protects your eyes from respiratory droplets and keeps you from touching your face. I don't know how well it would work from keeping droplet from reaching your mouth, but probably pretty well, especially if you used it with an N95 respirator. It might be a little shocking/intimidating to people, so I would only use it in extremely infected areas.
