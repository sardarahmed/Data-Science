Q:

how soon after unprotected sex can side effects of getting pregnant occur?

a person, lets call him bob had unprotected sex with jane on friday night lets say saturday morning at like 4 am. Monday evening at around 11 pm the girl feels like throwing up and bad generally.
Can it be because she is pregnant?

A:

If fertilization took place, chances are that implantation wouldn't even have happened yet, since that takes 3-4days, so until that happens, your body has no clue anything happened, much less react to it. http://www.webmd.com/baby/understanding-conception#1
