Q:

Why don't dentists use stitches after doing a tooth extraction?

I had tooth extraction in 2007. Dentist didn't use stitches just gave me a cotton told me to hold onto it with teeth. Bleeding last for 3-4 hours. 

Usually, however, bleeding will almost completely stop within eight
  hours of the surgery, ....

Why do dental doctors allow patients to bleed if there is a alternative to it? 

A:

It is not a black-and-white rule that no sutures are used in dental surgery. There are disadvantages to suturing, e. g.:

Clinical disadvantages of suturing: Although suturing postsurgically
  has many benefits, there are some disadvantages. Suture material that
  is braided can often act like a plaque trap and soak up bacteria. This
  is known as the "wick effect." (3) Bacteria in close adherence to the
  wound site can cause infection and delayed healing. In addition,
  breakdown products from the absorbable suture material itself have
  been shown to cause an inflammatory reaction in the tissue in certain
  cases. (4) The length of surgery may also be increased, since
  suturing—especially in advanced cases—can be time-consuming and
  technical. Studies have shown that any increase in surgical time can
  also be correlated with an increase in the postoperative pain a
  patient may experience. (5)
