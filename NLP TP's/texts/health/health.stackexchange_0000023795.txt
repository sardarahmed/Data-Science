Q:

Effectiveness of chlorine dioxide in fighting COVID-19

How effective would dissolving chlorine dioxide tablets in a bucket of water be for sterilizing a room from the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)? Would the vapors be enough?

A:

Chlorine dioxide is generally used for disinfection. In hospitals (where contamination rate is high) for disinfecting the surfaces,  2000 mg/L of chlorine dioxide is used, and for spraying 1000 mg/L of chlorine dioxide is used to disinfect the air. And at airports 250 - 500 mg/L chlorine dioxide is used for sterilization. 
And vapors are not enough for sterilizing room, it works by applying that disinfecting solution onto the surfaces or by spraying into air. Check out this link, to know how these chlorine dioxide tablets work.
Chlorine dioxide can be hazardous to human health, so use it with utmost precautions.
