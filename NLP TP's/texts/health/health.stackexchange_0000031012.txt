Q:

Is any anticholinergic necessarily antihistamine?

Choline is a nutrient chemically similar to B-vitamins needed for proper cell membrane production and muscle work.
Histamine is a natural product derivate of the amino acid histidine, which according to Wikipedia is:

involved in local immune responses, as well as regulating physiological functions in the gut and acting as a neurotransmitter for the brain, spinal cord, and uterus.

Till this day, any "anticholinergic drug" I learned about was also said to be "Antihistamine drug" (and vice versa).
Is any anticholinergic necessarily antihistamine?

A:

Anticholinergic medications are called this way because they block transmission via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. To be more precise, there are different types of acetylcholine receptors: nicotinergic and muscarinergic acetylcholine receptors. What we refer to as anticholinergica are usually selective inhibitors of the muscarinergic receptors. By this, they inhibit parasymphatic transmition and this is why they are also called (maybe a better term) parasympatholytics.
Anti-histaminic drugs however block the various histamine receptors.
In principle, anticholinergic and antihistaminic drugs are separate agents. The most common anticholinergic drugs are atropine, butylscopalamine and scopolamine.
Atropine has a (very low) affinity for histamine receptors and could therefore be considered anti-histaminic; but I have not found references whether it actually has an effect on humans in vivo. I could not find anything related to scopolamine and butylscopalamine.
In clinical practice, anticholinergic drugs are not considered antihistaminic drugs, and vice versa antihistaminic drugs are not considered anticholinergic.
