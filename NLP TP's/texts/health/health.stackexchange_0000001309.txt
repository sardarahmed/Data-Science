Q:

What are the rules on getting personal prescriptions mailed to you in Canada?

I'm a non-citizen in Canada. What are the rules on getting personal prescriptions mailed to me from my home country? I have long-term prescriptions which would (I think?) be much more expensive to get here, but are free back home. I have a sympathetic doctor there who'd dispense them to my children to mail to me.

A:

You can import 90 days (3 months) drug prescription supply - it sounds like you can do this in multiple times. There is a concise summary of this at 
https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140321030753AARucHH but the closest (imperfect) primary source I've found is http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/medication :
"The drug must be for your use or for the use of a person who is travelling with you and for whom you are responsible. The drug must be shipped or carried in hospital or pharmacy-dispensed packaging, the original retail packaging, or have the original label attached to it clearly indicating what the health product is and what it contains"
However I also remember finding this from a more direct government source a year ago when I looked for myself.
