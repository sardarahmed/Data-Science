Q:

centric occlusion vs maximum intercuspation

I have found it very confusing that in the dental and orthodontic literature, it is often stated that "centric occlusion" (CO) and "maximum intercuspation" (MIC) are synonyms (for example), despite the fact that there is tons of research on the discrepancy between CO and MIC (for example). How can CO and MIC be considered synonyms, and yet also be different (and in fact, the difference between them is of interest to dentists?).
Further adding to my confusion, according to Wikipedia, MIC "used to be referred to as centric occlusion", but there isn't a reference to back up this specific claim.
Could someone 1) clarify appropriate terminology for me, and 2) provide a reference to support the correct terminology?

A:

Centric occlusion is an articular position and maximum intercuspation is a dental position. 
It suppose that, in a healthy person, both are the same, and that the problems with TMJ arises when there is a discrepancy. 
Hence, for a rehabilitation of a total edentulous person, you should rehabilitate with MIC = CO.
Anyway, there is no evidence linking absence of CO in MIC with pathology.
