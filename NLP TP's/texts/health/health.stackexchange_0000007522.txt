Q:

Poison Ivy or Spider Bite?

My wife and I were exposed to poison ivy last Saturday (7/16). I have more rashes that her but she has this rash that keeps expanding, picture below.
The small oval with the dark spots showed up immediately. By Tuesday the itch had began. Each day the big red circle has been gotten larger. At first the dark spots were black and looked like black-spot poison ivy.
Could this be a spider bite or a bad case of poison ivy? 

A:

Doc-In-Box diagnosed as Cellulitis from poison ivy and gave steroid shot and antibiotics prescription.
