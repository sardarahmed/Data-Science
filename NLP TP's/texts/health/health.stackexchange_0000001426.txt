Q:

Body's response to rapid ingestion of water?

As we are all aware, if you drink a large quantity of water in a short time period, you will  likely have to go to the toilet not too long afterwards.
The body detects the increase in fluid volume (or more precisely in this instance the decrease in sodium concentration) and kicks off the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway.
This ultimately results in a decrease in anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) which in turn decreases water absorption from the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubule in the kidney.
So my question is, if we rapidly consume a large volume of water in a very short period of time, could the resulting decrease in ADH hormone overshoot the mark and result in the body eliminating more water than what is ideal.
That is, could drinking a large amount of water in a short time actually have a dehydrating effect?

A:

I don't belive it is possible for the body to produce too much ADH.  The body will likely produce insufficient ADH to eliminate the ingested water, thus you will still remain in a state of hyponatremia even after the body's ADH response.
The body will then return to homeostatus by reducing thirst.
This means of course that if you ingest too much water (ignoring your lack of thirst) you can create serious health problems for yourself.
