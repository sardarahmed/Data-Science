Q:

Why is FMT an effective treatment for Clostridium difficile?

I have a relative who has gone through a few different courses of antibiotics to combat a Clostridium difficile infection, with limited success. As I understand it, the initial antibiotic course for an unrelated infection wiped out normal biota and allowed the C. difficile to get established.
However, what I'm not understanding is how fecal transplant can be effective? The C. difficile is already established, is the biota being transplanted enough to be able to suppress/supplant the already established infection?

A:

It seems to be unclear and likely some kind of combination of several factors. 
The paper Fecal microbiota transplantation in relapsing Clostridium difficile infection mentions two theories as to why it works (and works very well):

The introduction of bacteria able to compete with C. difficile rebalances the fecal microbiota - under normal circumstances, CD is outcompeted by other bacteria (not always enough to vanish, it can be found in about 1 in 30 healthy people, but enough to not be problematic), and it can only thrive after the use of antibiotics. A FMT reintroduces its competitors 
The introduction of the 'new' bacteria leads to an immune response that helps eradicating C. difficile

The first mechanism is what I found mentioned in a few other sources as well, for example on OpenBiome:

Though the mechanism has yet to be determined, it is believed that FMT works by repopulating the patientâ€™s microbiome with diverse microorganisms that competitively exclude C. difficile

Another hypothesis is that the acid composition in the feces is significantly altered and inhibits growth of CD, see Changes in Colonic Bile Acid Composition following Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Are Sufficient to Control Clostridium difficile Germination and Growth.
