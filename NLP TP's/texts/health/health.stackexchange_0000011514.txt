Yes, they do.

Is it true that American students take USMLE separated in subjects not a as a whole set of 300 questions on all topics?

It is false. It's the same.

USMLE Step 1 :  single-day, composed of seven 40-question sections with a maximum 280 multiple-choice questions (Source: usmle.org)
USMLE Step 2 CK: 9-hour single-day computer-based test composed of eight question sets with no more than 40 questions per set (Source: usmle.org)
USMLE Step 3: 2 days (9 hours and 8 hours) with the first day multiple choice questions, and second day multiple choice and computer-based (simulation-like) questions.  It's broken into hour chunks like Step 2 CK.
