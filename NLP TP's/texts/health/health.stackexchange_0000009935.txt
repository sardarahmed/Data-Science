Q:

Can one candy bar per day be part of a healthy diet?

Are there any ill effects from eating one normally size candy bar per day over a long period of time, as part of an otherwise well-balanced diet for an active adult?  
For example, a Twix bar with:

250 calories 
12 g total fat
7 g saturated fat
24 g sugar 

A:

Twix is part of an otherwise healthy diet.
According to the American Heart Association the limit is 36 grams of sugar.  That is 2/3 of the recommended maximum in one little bar. 
That one little bar is 35% of the recommended saturated fat for the day.  
You would need an otherwise perfect diet to balance out. People with an otherwise perfect diet just don't have a craving for a Twix.  I seriously doubt what you are characterizing as well-balanced diet is a perfect diet other than the Twix. 
If you have a craving for something sweet then a 1-2 sweet fruits is part of a healthy diet.
