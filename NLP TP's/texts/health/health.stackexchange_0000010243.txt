Q:

Why i feel cold

I would like to ask you if you know the reasons somebody feels
Cold .I have underthyroid  problem.Is there connection between the cold and the underthyroid?My age is 25 and i am woman

A:

One may be cold for several reasons:  low air temperature especially if it is windy and humid, is the most common cause. Some people are cold at 70ºF, others only at 60ºf and a few people are very hardy and can easily tolerate temperatures below 50ºF provided there is no wind. 
Younger and physically active people can also tolerate low temperatures better than the aged or bedridden. 
High body temperature is another cause: fever and hyperthermia are examples.  
Some disease states also make you more sensitive to cold temperatures: hypothyroidism is one of them.
