Q:

Are there reliable studies on the viability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with respect to temperature?

There have been "suggestions" (facebook, media etc) that the novel coronavirus is heat sensitive. Specifically that the virus is "killed" or impotent when subjected to temperature of 77F. 
Are there any peer-reviewed studies that would support such a contention?
More broadly, are there any peer-reviewed studies on the viability of the virus in other naturally occurring circumstances?
(As I am not a medical professional or researcher, I'm a bit lost on how to do my own research to find appropriate and reliable information on this - I'm not even sure that I'm using the appropriate terminology. This is why I've come to this site: for guidance on how to get the information )

A:

Here are studies on viability at different temperature for similar viruses

UPDATE:
According to:Lancet April 2 2020
The concentration of SARS-COV-2 decayed thusly:
To my non-professional eye it appears that at 72F the concentration of SARS-COV-2 decayed by (approximately) 50% after 72 hours.
When the same experiment was carried at at 99F the concentration decayed by 50% in 24 hours.
The same experiment when carried out at 133 F, the concentration decayed by 50% in 10 minutes.
The layperson's conclusion: Extraordinary heating conditions (greater than 100 F) will be required to decay the virus in a reasonable time period (less than 24 hours).
