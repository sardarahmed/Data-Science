Q:

What is Spanish equivalent of webpage clinicaltrials.gov?

Can you recommend any Spanish database of medical studies/clinical records, equivalent to English clinicaltrials.gov ? Medical texts should be in Spanish, not webpage necessarily.

A:

EU Clinical Trials Register provides clinical trials from EU and EEA, including Spain. Some trials are in 2 languages (country of origin plus English).
