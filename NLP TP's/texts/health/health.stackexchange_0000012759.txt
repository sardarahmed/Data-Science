Q:

What is the amount of caffeine in the human body over time?

Let's say I know how much caffeine I drank and when. Just knowing my sex, weight (and maybe height), what is the best estimate for how much caffeine is in my system now?
For example: Suppose I drank 180 mg of caffeine 5 hours ago, another 180 mg of caffeine 2 hours ago, I'm female and weigh 140 pounds.
I'm guessing food intake may also have a lot to do with it, but let's ignore that. Is a good estimate available?
Motivation: I am logging my blood pressure and want to know if it's correlated with the amount of caffeine in my blood. Rather than just write down how much caffeine I had that day, I wondered if there might be a better measure of how much caffeine I have at the time of measurement.

A:

Caffeine is readily absorbed, with up to 99% absorbed within 45 minutes of ingestion.[1]
The mean half-life in healthy individuals is 5 hours, although this varies widely between individuals, ranging from 1.5 to 9.5 hours. For our purposes, we'll use the mean of 5 hours.[1]
Knowing the above plus how much caffeine you've ingested will allow you to plot caffeine levels over time. Given the wide variation in half-life, I'm going to ignore the 99% absorption and treat it as 100%. Using your example we get:

The 180 mg you ingested 5 hours ago is now down to 90 mg.
The 180 mg you ingested 2 hours ago is now down to 136 mg. 
Therefore, there are now 90 + 136 = 226 mg in your system. 

Clearly that's only a ballpark figure given the wide variance of half-life times, but it's probably as close as you can get without more rigorous measuring techniques.
