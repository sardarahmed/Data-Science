Q:

Could an infinitesimal amount of Covid-19 be used to trigger immune response?

Could one be injected with an infinitesimal amount of Covid-19 viral particles, in a way that it would trigger an immune response long enough before the virus overran the body? Could it be injected into tissue that was far enough away from the lungs, so that some immunity could build up before the virus reached the lungs?
I am talking about something similar to variolation, which was a method used to control the spread of smallpox. Material from smallpox sores (pustules) was given to people who had never had smallpox. This was done either by scratching the material into the arm or inhaling it through the nose.
People usually went on to develop the symptoms associated with smallpox. However, fewer people died than if they had acquired smallpox naturally.

A:

What you're describing is a live-virus vaccine.  The only live-virus vaccines ever used were the early smallpox vaccines, which carried a significant risk of causing the disease rather than building immunity.  Even attenuated vaccines (using a live but weakened form of the virus) can cause disease; most cases of polio these days are caused by the oral polio vaccine.  Vaccines using inactivated viruses or virus fragments are strongly preferred.
