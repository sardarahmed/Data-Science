Q:

Tuberculosis: Lung scarring and weight gain

I have a few questions regarding tuberculosis:

If a person is cured of Tuberculosis, is it compulsory for all patients effected by Tb to have a patch/scar on their lung? (references for patch) 
Reference
Can't the patch/scar on the lung ever go away? Or will it stay forever? If it can go away, in what procedure can it be done?
One of the references talk about the weight gain. If there is no weight gain, what does that mean?

A:

No, it is not compulsory for all the patients to have/develop a scar which is most probably the pulmonary fibrosis or might be residual parenchymal lesions.

In certain cases, it is due to not doing the breathing exercises while taking the standard regime of HREZ (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) 

Yes, it can get better(not completely removed) with time if the person does variety of breathing exercises like:

Yoga (pranayam).
Deep breathing, using props like balloons.
Aerobics, morning walks, etc.

In tuberculosis, weight gain is a healthy indication that the medicines are working.  The medicines are given keeping in mind the current weight of the patient. The importance of maintaining a proper BMI(Body Mass Index) is revealed in case studies of relapses.
