Q:

How anti-inflammatory are nsaids?

So I currently have some bad tonsillitis and an infection in one of my ears. My doctor at school gave me ibuprofen (for pain and anti-inflammation) and penicillin. I was just wondering if higher doses (doc told me 2x 200mg tablets) would reduce inflammation even further. Is there a point where the nsaid can't help anymore, even in higher doses? (Ex. If I take 3 200mg pills will it reduce inflammation even more than 2 pills would?)

A:

You're asking if there is a dose response relationship for ibuprofen, and what does it look like. For most people the analgesic effect (surrogate for inflammation) flattens out at 400 mg, but 20% might get a better response with a higher dose. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2000723/
