Q:

Flax seed vs supplements for omega-3

I was comparing sources of omega-3.
Supplements:

0.75 g * 180 / $ 21.96 = 6.1 g/$ (here)
0.75 g * 120 / $ 25.62 = 3.5 g/$ (here)
1.40 g * 90 / $ 28.47 = 4.4 g/$ (here) (label is per 2 capsules)
0.45 g * 60 / $ 33.65 = 0.8 g/$ (here) (vegan)

Flax seed:

Flax seed oil has 6.388 g/tbsp Omega-3, according to Wikipedia (here) (2 tbsp/oz).
Virgin flax seed oil costs around 0.34 $/oz (here) or 0.66 $/oz (here).
So 1 oz contains 12.8 g omega-3 for 0.34 $, or 38.0 g/$.

My question then is, can I just use flax seed oil, or am I over-simplifying this?

A:

The omega-3 fatty acids with potential health benefits are EPA and DHA found in fish and fish oil.
The omega-3 in flaxseed is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and there seems to be insufficient evidence about their effectiveness in preventing heart disease, for example.
It is true that ALA can be converted to EPA and DHA in your body, but this conversion is very poor.
NutrientsReview:

...alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from flaxseed, walnuts and soybeans is
  much less effective in preventing heart disease than fish oil, which
  contains EPA and DHA.

There is also some concern that ALA supplements might be associated with an increased risk of cancer, according to The Journal of Nutrition, while according to another source (PubMed) it is not.
