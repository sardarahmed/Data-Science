Q:

How to lower SpO2?

My oximeter always shows a value of 97.
I've been trying to figure out how to influence the value, however it always stays the same.
I tried to hold my breath or tied my finger up (to limit blood flow), with the assumtion, that this would lower the blood oxigen level.
However, the value stayed the same.
How could I change my values (up and down)?

A:

I tried it out on my pulse oximeter.  I placed it on my thumb where it read 97%.  I then held my breath and it gradually dropped down over the course of a minute to 93% before I had to give up.
I suggest you check your device on other people in case it's defective.
