Q:

Can ingesting a mosquito make you sick?

I just accidentally ate a mosquito. I am afraid, what if the mosquito just drank blood of a HIV infected person, will I get the infection too, or some other disease? 

A:

Positively, no.
HIV is not spread by mosquitoes. 
You cannot contract any disease from swallowing  a mosquito. 
Here, is a very large list of all the things that you could have caught :) If you were bitten.
