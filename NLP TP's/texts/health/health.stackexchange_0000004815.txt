Q:

Are there any health risks associated with opening a microwave oven before it has finished?

I have noticed that some people press the Stop or Pause button before opening an active microwave oven.  Other people open them right up while they are running, without manually stopping them first.
Assuming that a microwave oven is operating properly, and that it was built in the last quarter-century, are there any real risks with opening a microwave oven without stopping it first?

A:

There's nothing else to be released, because when microwave production is stopped the waves cease to exist.
From the FDA's FAQ about microwave safety: 

systems that stop the production of microwaves the moment the latch is released or the door opened. In addition, a monitoring system stops oven operation in case one or both of the interlock systems fail. The noise that many ovens continue to make after the door is open is usually the fan. The noise does not mean that microwaves are being produced. There is no residual radiation remaining after microwave production has stopped. In this regard a microwave oven is much like an electric light that stops glowing when it is turned off.

Provided that your microwave meets regulations regarding the double locking mechanism, more radiation is leaked when the door is closed and the microwave is on than when the door is opened and the microwave is off.
