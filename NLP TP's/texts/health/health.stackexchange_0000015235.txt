Q:

Does a man's ejaculation of semen decrease in volume, with age?

My question is:  As I get older, should I expect that the volume of my semen will decrease?  

A:

First off, not sure if this question is serious or not, but here goes.
According to this study (n=97, age 22-80):

After adjusting for covariates, semen volume decreased by 0.03 ml per
  year of age

I have no idea how much volume is in a handful of semen, but

The median semen volume was 2.7 ml

The average age in the population was 46.
Therefore, we can expect that on average, if the average volume of ejaculate in a 46 year old is 2.7 mL, the average volume of a 20 year old would be 3.46 mL, and the average volume of an 85 year old would be 1.53 mL. This gives a net ejaculation volume loss between ages 20 and 85 of 1.93 mL, or 55%.
HUGE caveat(s):

This was a relatively small study using a convenience sample
None of the participants were as young as 20 or as old as 85
There is no data to say whether the decline is an absolute or relative, ie does everyone lose 0.03 a year, or is it a fixed percentage.
Peter North is a clear outlier and so it's impossible to say how this data applies to him
"Handful" is not an accepted unit of measurement for semen volume
The study did not address the question of elderly ejaculate feeling like sand
