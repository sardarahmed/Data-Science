Q:

Gallstones pain relief?

What suggestions are there for pain relief caused by stones in the gallbladder, while waiting for surgery date? 
Placing something cold as an ice bag on the area, reduces the pain, and that helps, but any other recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

A:

If your abdomen pain in the upper right quadrant have been diagnosed as gall bladder stones and you are awaiting for surgery, I am very puzzled that you have not received a prescription for appropriate pain relief medication.
In Finland the drug of choice is Litalgin, which contains metamizole and pitophenone. The former is a pain killer and the latter is muscle relaxant which affects directly to smooth muscle tissues located in GI and urinary tract. It is also very good medication for kidney stones.
Another good medication for gallbladder stones is any fast acting NSAID.
You should contact your GP or treating surgeon for appropriate medication.
