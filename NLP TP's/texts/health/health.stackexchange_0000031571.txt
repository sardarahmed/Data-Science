Q:

How did hereditary diseases originally start?

(To preface this, I've 0 knowledge of medicine)
If diseases such as Huntington's are hereditary and you can't develop/catch them later in life, how did the original person in the family bloodline get it? Because if their parents didn't have it and, therefore they weren't born with it, surely that means that they must've developed or acquired later it in life meaning that you either could've developed way back when or can still develop it now?

A:

You are almost spot on!
Children usually do not have exactly the same DNA as their parents, because it is evolutionarily wise to allow some new traits to emerge.
So, there can be spontaneous mutations in the DNA of a child that their parents did not have. In the case of Huntington‘s disease, approximately 10% of cases are actually such new („de novo“) mutations that are not inherited. They are uncommon, but not extremely rare.
These changes in the DNA happen to the sperm and the egg which become you, so once you are born (or actually once the zygote has been formed), you either have the mutation or you don’t.
