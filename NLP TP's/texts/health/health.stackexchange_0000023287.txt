Q:

Are these x-rays consistent with a broken arm on a 6-year-old girl?

I found these x-rays (one and two) in a box of stuff from my mother, and I know she had broken her arm in 1939 when she was 6:

Are these x-rays consistent with a girl of her age?  Does the number on the image contain any information that would narrow down when the x-rays were taken?  (yes she was living in Denver)

A:

X-rays normally contain identification markers to indicate the side, the date, possibly name and other information.  It looks like you've cut part of the x-rays off but it looks like there's a treating MD's name at the top.  
The date could be 9th August 1939, and the 1636 a clinic ID or something else.  It's not a timestamp as it's the same in both x-rays.  The L means left arm.
It clearly is an x-ray of a greenstick fracture of the distal radius in a child, because the epiphyses have not yet fused.
