Q:

Will the COVID-19 virus ever stop mutating into new variants?

I am curious to know if it has been discussed within the medical community as to whether the COVID-19 virus will ever stop mutating into new variants, and if it has been discussed, what is the consensus on this particular issue?

A:

No it won't stop mutating. Mutating is a feature of life with nucleic acids, no matter if you are a virus, bacterium, archaea, fungi, plant or animal.
You can check on mutation rates in organisms with a simple google search for the terms "mutation rate (species of interest)"
