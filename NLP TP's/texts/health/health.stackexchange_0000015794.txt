Q:

How feasible is the discovery of the organ „interstitium“ (opposed to it just being interstitial space)?

A study published on March 27th in Nature by researchers from the New York Univeristy‘s School Of Medicine postulates an entirely new organ, the interstitium, basically a fluid/tissue system that is supposedly larger than the skin itself.
Is this discovery as great as it sounds? Based on how I understand the article, the type of tissue was already known. The article only shows article mere scale of it.
How feasible is it that this organ was undetected by now? How feasible is it that the tissue does in fact qualify as a fluid system and organ and isn’t just a type of tissue?

A:

Short answer
The authors explicitly mention to have found a component of tissues, not an organ.  
Background
The authors make no mention of an 'organ'. Here's an excerpt from the Discussion section of the linked paper: 

In sum, while typical descriptions of the interstitium suggest spaces between cells, we describe macroscopically visible spaces within tissues – dynamically compressible and distensible sinuses through which interstitial fuid fows around the body. 

It's all about semantics: they say 'macroscopically visible spaces within tissues'. So they speak on a sub-tissue scale. Now the following figure shows the layers of organzation in an organism, which has significance to your question. It shows that organs are made our of tissues. In turn, the authors of the article are explicitly talking about interstitial spaces within tissues, and they do not claim to have found an organ anywhere in the paper. Instead, the authors claim to have stumbled upon  interstitial found within tissues, so indeed at a sub-tissue level.
