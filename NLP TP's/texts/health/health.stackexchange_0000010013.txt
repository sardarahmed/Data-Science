How to remove the yellow stains from my teeth?
I brush two times a day once in the morning and once in  the night.But I am still having yellow stains in my teeth.The back side of two of my teeth have also turned brown.
I have also brushed with baking powder for 3-4 days but no result came .
What should I do to get natural color of my teeth back?Please help.

A:

There are a few aspects that need to be addressed.
1) Diet & Oral habits: Often, drinks with natural or artificial coloring will stain the surface of the enamel and any tartar (calcified plaque) that rests on your tooth. Some oral products (ex: smoking) and medication (ex: some mouthrinces and some antibiotics) are also known to cause discoloration.  Any long-term solutions will require you to examine the cause of the coloration, and whether there are underlying causes for it (a more in-depth look at teeth coloration can be fond here: 1).
2) Cleaning and scaling: A dental health professional can remove the tartar and remove external coloration. This procedure has to be performed every 6-12 months if not more often, depending on that professional's assessment of your current health 2.
3) Chemical treatment If all external coloration has been removed, and you are still dissatisfied with your tooth color, a dentist can assess and prescribe you a whitening agent, or otherwise recommend an off the shelf solution but this is beyond the scope of the original question.
