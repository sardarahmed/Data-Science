Q:

How to tell the difference between not so serious wrist, finger, arm pain/strain/weakness and carpal tunnel syndrome?

Many people now a days, use the computer a lot. A very lot. 
I'm guessing it's normal to feel some slight discomfort, small pain regularly in your dominant hand, wrist, and/or underside of forearm if you use the computer for greater than 5 hours a day everyday?
Or is this a sign that you may be developing/have carpal tunnel syndrome?

A:

Slight discomfort or little pain is quite obvious when you use computers for more than 5 hrs a day, that too for many months/years. 
But then, such situation is all set to bring in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. As a medical professional, I think the most important symptoms you should check/watch for include

tingling sensation and numbness (emptiness)

These are the symptoms that are alarming signs of CTS. At times, these are associated with weakness.
When to count it seriously?
I think the time is when it disturbs your routine works or wakes you up in the nights.
