Q:

How many people end up needing medical attention during the 15 minute window after receiving the Pfizer vaccine?

Everyone receiving the COVID vaccines is asked to wait for 15 minutes in case they have a bad reaction to the shot. Given that we've now had hundreds of millions of Pfizer vaccine shots injected around the world, is there any data showing how many of those people end up needing medical attention during those 15 minutes (possibly 20 minutes in some areas, as reported in comments)?
If such data is available, do we know how many of those people ended up needing attention because of the vaccine itself? I.e. if you take any random 15 minute period, around 23 Americans will get a heart attack during that time, so logically speaking not all cases of medical problems during the 15 minute period will be caused by the vaccine itself.
Note that I'm only interested in that exact 15-minute waiting period, not any other side effects from the vaccine that are detected later on. I.e. myocarditis is suspected to be linked to the COVID shot for some people, but that's usually detected later on, not during the 15 minute observation period.

A:

The most noteworthy complication, and most heard about in the news, is anaphylaxis.
This article breaks down cases of anaphylaxis nicely: Reports of Anaphylaxis After Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines in the US—December 14, 2020-January 18, 2021. They provide a great table with a specification of whether the case happened during the 15-minute window:

So for Pfizer specifically the numbers are:

4.7 anaphylaxis cases per million in total
3.6 cases per million if only the 15 minute window is considered
1.1 per million for those without a prior allergic reaction to a drug or vaccine

This doesn't account for non-anaphylaxis allergic reactions (more common, less severe), vasovagal syncope(fear of needles/injections), or any other, more rare conditions.
To date data regarding medical attention received within 15 minutes of vaccination has been hard to come by. The data from the first week of Pfizer administration, covering some 1.8m patients shows that non-anaphylaxis allergic reactions were roughly 8 times more common (and typically far less severe) than anaphylactic reactions.
While we could attempt to extrapolate based on anaphylaxis cases and non over the year based on the first week's data, it'd be a relatively pointless exercise. The occurrences/million for anaphylaxis dropped from 11.1 to 4.7 in the time frame. We can't assume the reduction in case numbers to be proportionally identical, yet a simple extrapolation based only on time would be disingenuous.
In short, reliable data on the topic outside anaphylaxis is hard to come by because other instances requiring medical attention are either less severe or less common.

The data on this aren't hard to find. Here are some more examples that specifically provide time frames to back up @A Rogue Ant's answer:
For the Pfizer vaccine:

During December 14–23, 2020, monitoring by the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System detected 21 cases of anaphylaxis after administration
of a reported 1,893,360 first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine (11.1 cases per million doses); 71% of these occurred within
15 minutes of vaccination.

And for Moderna:

During December 21, 2020–January 10, 2021, monitoring by the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System detected 10 cases of anaphylaxis after
administration of a reported 4,041,396 first doses of Moderna COVID-19
vaccine (2.5 cases per million doses administered). In nine cases,
onset occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination. No
anaphylaxis-related deaths were reported.

In both studies, 70-90% of anaphylactic reactions occurred within the first 15 minutes, hence the 15-minute protocol.

A:

For the UK up to 27 October 2021:
All recipients were requested to wait 15 minutes before departing the point of vaccination.
A history of anaphylactic reactions to any of the ingredients forbids taking the vaccine, but which dose (first or second) the listed reactions occurred after is not specified in the data.
Estimated first/second doses - Vaccine Manufacturer - Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions.

23.5/20.3 million doses - Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - 517

24.9/24.1 million doses - AstraZeneca - 834

1.5/1.3 million doses - Moderna - 41

From UK Government website 8th November 2021.
With reference to the total number of reactions reported:
Pfizer/BioNTech - 357,084 (Anaphylactic data on page 31)
Astra Zenica - 836,957 (Anaphyl. data page 37)
Moderna - 55,081 (Anaphyl. data page 18)
A small number of reports from unspecified vaccines with 1 anaphylactoid reaction for 3,557 reports.
