Q:

Do transvaginal ultrasounds break the hymen if one is a virgin? Is it painful for a virgin?

I was diagnosed with PCOS a number of years ago. Recently, my OBGYN set up an ultrasound for me to check on the status of my ovarian-cysts. I just thought it would be a normal pelvic ultrasound performed on the external part of my body, but I found out it will be an internal procedure known as "transvaginal ultrasound." From what I understand, that means the ultrasound wand is inserted into my vagina to take the imaging needed. 
I am pretty nervous (honestly, scared out of my mind) because I'm a virgin. Will a transvaginal ultrasound break my hymen as I am a virgin??? How much pain should I anticipate?

A:

During Transvaginal Ultrasaund procedure defloration (breaking a hymen) can happen but not necessarily;It depends on several factors. 
Transvaginal Ultrasaund in virgins should be performed only with patent's signed informed consent form (or by close relatives if patient is not of legal age or is unable to do so). 
This is very important,especially in culturally sensitive regions as can be detrimental for patient's future life,thus if defloration happens It will be documented and can be shown to the interested sides. 
Informed consent is legal document that is intended to protect both:the patient and the doctor who performs the procedure. 
Information mentioned above is derived from own practice. 
Unfortunately no research or case report is available by online search.
