Q:

Is eating one's dinner right before going to sleep bad for health?

I often read or hear that eating one's dinner right before going to sleep is bad for health. How true is that?

A:

If you eat a lot of food, your stomach will be full. And if you lie down immediately after that, your horizontal posture would put the food (and the acid) in such a way that it puts lot more pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter. If you are a patient of acid reflux disease (or if you have a comparitively weak sphincter and are pre-disposed to develop acid reflux disease), then doing this would greatly increase your chances of developing it. So lifestyle modifications doctors prescribe to patients of acid reflux disease is that:

Eat in small quantities, and in multiple meals
Give a time gap between dinner and sleep
Elevate head end of your bed when you go to sleep. 

Acid reflux during sleep is notorious because

It damages the mucosa (from below upwards, all of it) making the patient susceptible to Barrett's oesophagus and Oesophageal Ca
Acid refluxing into the mouth would mean poor oral hygiene, bad breath in the morning, slowly degrading tooth
Aspiration of acid can damage the larynx and can cause Ca Larynx, and can even cause chemical pneumonitis.
