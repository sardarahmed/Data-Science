Q:

Does infectious hemophilia exist?

Coagulopathies or bleeding disorders, like hemophilia, and Von Willebrand's syndrome, are diseases in which the blood's ability to coagulate is impaired.
But, is there an infectious disease that can be considered a coagulopathy?
I ask because I am writing a story with a disease caused by a virus that impairs coagulation.

A:

I would not call it hemophilia, but viral hemorrhagic fevers involve coagulopathy (quote from Wikipedia):

small blood clots form in blood vessels throughout the body, removing platelets necessary for clotting from the bloodstream and reducing clotting ability. DIC is thought to cause bleeding in Rift Valley, Marburg, and Ebola fevers.

Ebola would be the disease probably most commonly known to the popular consciousness, but you'll see from that Wikipedia page that there are quite a few virus families that cause similar symptoms, and the severity of those symptoms varies widely.
For more on the mechanism of the coagulation aspect of ebola, see:
