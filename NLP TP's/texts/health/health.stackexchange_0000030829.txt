Q:

Do monthly contact lenses have to be discarded 30 days from opening them even if they haven't been used?

I'm -8.00(OD) & -7.25(OS) and thinking of getting contacts lenses for the very first time. I plan on getting the monthly disposable type. I'll be wearing them once or twice a week mostly when I head out. Since I will be using them maybe 8 times a month, and since they're designed to be used for 30 days, can I keep wearing them till they reach 30 uses, or do I need to dispose them 30 days after I've taken them out of their packaging?

A:

From this FAQ (question 37):

Does monthly contact lens mean 30 wears?
Monthly disposable contact lenses should be thrown away precisely 30 days after opening the blister pack, regardless of the number of times you have worn them.

Here is another article that quotes:

Also called "extended wear lenses" or "monthly contact lenses," continuous wear lenses are soft contact lenses that are approved by the FDA for up to 30 consecutive days of continuous day-and-night wear without removal.

So basically, it doesn't matter if you didn't wear the contact lenses as much; you'll still need to dispose them after 30 days of opening the package.
