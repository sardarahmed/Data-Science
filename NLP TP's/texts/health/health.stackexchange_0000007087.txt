Q:

Does reclining the front or back seat of a car reduce the effectiveness of the seat belt?

I wonder whether reclining the front or back seat of a car reduces the effectiveness of the seat belt in case of an accident.
Example of reclined front seats:

Example of a reclined back seat:

A:

Yes. 
The effect of reclined seats on mortality in motor vehicle collisions.

The reclined position is associated with increased occupant mortality
  in motor vehicle collisions.

Why?

flexion and compression injuries over pretensioned lap and shoulder
  belts resulted in severe thoracoabdominal and spine injuries in
  restrained occupants, with a high associated mortality. Increased
  lower extremity injuries from additional force loads into bolsters and
  panels were also noted.

Seatbelt effectiveness

If your car seat is reclined, a three-point restraint (lap and
  shoulder seat belt) becomes esentially useless because the shoulder
  harness moves away from the passenger. Seat belts do not work -- and,
  in fact, can make injuries worse -- if they are not properly designed (proper "seat belt geometry") or not properly worn. 

Few people understand that the more space between the seat belt and
  the passenger's chest increases the risk of death or serious injury
  caused when your body either slams against the seat belt itself or
  "submarines" and slides beneath the seat belt.

So yes, this is just a few ways reclining the seat can reduce the effectiveness of the seatbelt.
