Q:

How can a ruptured ulcer all the way in the duodenum, cause kidney failure?

The famous Nobel Prize winning physicist is said to have died because

"A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure",

leading to his death 12 days later. I understand that the kidney might have needed to do more filtration work due to this rupture, and maybe the ulcer contained some material too hard on the kidney, but how exactly does the contents of the ulcer spewing into the duodenum result lead to kidney failure? What are the steps that would occur that would lead to this outcome?

A:

Your stomach may contain bacteria that are harmless as long as they are in your digestive tract, but are potentially lethal if they get into other organs. A ruptured ulcer means that it's possible for the stomach contents  to leak into the abdominal cavity and possibly the bloodstream. If the bacteria get established in you blood they will be carried to all the other organs creating a massive infection. The immune response to the infection may create a condition called sepsis. Sepsis is a well known complication from perforated ulcers and frequently leads to kidney failure.
