Q:

Type II Diabetes (T2D) Remission with Age?

Several medical providers have told an elderly relative that his T2D was probably not reversed through his (isocaloric) low-carb diet, rather that T2D generally goes away on its own in the elderly. That last phrase is the point of my question.
How much substance is there to this claim that diabetes can go away “on its own” in the elderly, not due to dietary changes (intentional or otherwise)?

A:

There seems to be no scientific evidence to support the claim that diabetes type 2 generally goes away on its own (without drugs, diet or weight loss) in the elderly.
According to one analytical article in BMJ, 2017, remission of diabetes type 2 is "currently very rarely achieved or recorded."
In elderly, remission may be slightly more common. In a large cohort study (Diabetes Care, 2014), "1.5% of individuals with diabetes type 2 not treated with bariatric surgery or drugs (but treated with diet or weight loss) achieved at least partial remission over a 7-year period. Remission occured in 2.2% of individuals 65 years or older (table 4).
In one randomized clinical trial (PubMed, 2012), intensive lifestyle intervention, including exercise, diet and weight loss, resulted in at least partial remission in 11.5% of individuals with diabetes type 2 within the 1st year of the intervention.
