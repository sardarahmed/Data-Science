Q:

Can I eat fish everyday or alternate day?

I am planning to eat fish daily,  because I love fish. If I eat like that do I have any chance of developing health issues ? Any suggestions are welcome.

A:

Is it okay to eat fish every day?
Overall, there are few big risk to your health compared to eating beef or some unhealthy meat everyday. 

Omega 3 fatty acids could be good for heart health. It lowers triglycerides and total cholesterol. 
Some large fish such as tuna, shark and mackerel may have mercury in them 

Patients at greatest risk of developing MeHg poisoning are those who
  eat fish often and who prefer higher-mercury seafood varieties such as
  swordfish or tuna

There are heart and other health benefits shown from eating it a couple times a week, but the same benefits can be gotten from daily consumption. But not more if you eat more. 

So your biggest health concerns:

Mercury: Your increasing your risk of exposure. Mercury has shown to be bad for brain health and etc.
Omega 3 fatty acids: can be good for your health
