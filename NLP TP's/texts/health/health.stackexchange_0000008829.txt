Q:

What is a "senior" tongue depressor?

Shopping for tongue depressors online, I found some that were listed as "senior".  What is the difference between a "senior" tongue depressor and an "adult" one?

A:

From the products online labelled as such, there seems to be no difference between "adult size", "Standard" and "Senior" sized (6") tongue depressors. On the other hand, I would assume "Senior" is used to differentiat that product from the "Junior" (5.5"), "Infant" (4.5") tongue depressors, which some companies label as such.
