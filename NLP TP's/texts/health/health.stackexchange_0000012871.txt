Q:

Is Anilingus healthy?

Some animals do Anilingus, so it might be  reasonable to think that also among healthy humans anilingus might be without harm or is even healthy to strengthen the immune system or has some other benefits. Is that true when done on a regular basis from a young age on like some animals do, that it is healthy? 

A:

According to Jack Morin, the author of

Anal Pleasure and Health: A Guide for Men, Women and Couples

anilingus can actually be beneficial (point 10 of '10 Rules of Anal Sex').

Anal sex can be perfectly safe, even beneficial.
  The taboo against anal eroticism is perpetuated by the almost universal belief among physicians that anal sex is inevitably dangerous. No physical injury from anal stimulation results if both partners refuse to tolerate pain, never use force and
  avoid the use of drugs.
  . . .
  Thousands of men and women with chronic anal medical problems have
  restored their anal health by challenging their
  negative attitudes. This approach is indispensable for full erotic
  enjoyment of the anus.

But most references claim (e.g. the Wikipedia link above) claim that it is very hazardous to your health.
An audio excerpt from this book is available from:

in which the narrator describes only how to avoid 'anal hell', and does not mention any positive medical advantages.
