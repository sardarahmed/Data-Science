Q:

How can I describe my eye weakness (disease) to a doctor?

5 days ago, I found that my right eye does not work properly. The vision of the left eye is better.
Here is how I feel:
When a person press strongly on his closed eye by his figures or hand, The vision becomes unclear temporarily. This is how I see but I see it permanently.
When a person look at the sun or a strong light, Then the vision in a normal lighted room becomes unclear. This is how I feel too.
I think I have a problem with the brightness of the right eye. I don't have issue with colours or resolution. I do NOT see a blurry image. My problem is with light I think. I also see kind of floaters.
Soon, I will go to a doctor. What is the best way to describe my problem? so that he checks me correctly? 

A:

I'm quite sure the description you give here is enough for a doctor. 
Please take a look at this: http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/benign-eye-floaters
WebMD is a reliable source. They state:

If you only have a few eye floaters that don't change over time, don’t
  sweat it.
Go to the doctor ASAP if you notice:

A sudden increase in the number of floaters 
Flashes of light 
A loss ofside vision Changes that come on quickly and get worse over time
Floaters after eye surgery or eye trauma Eye pain 

Choose a doctor who has experience with retina problems. If you don’t get help right away, you could lose your sight.
