Q:

Effectiveness of Plant Based Diet to losing weight

Movies such as "Sick Fat Nearly Dead" and "Forks over Knives" and "Engine 2" tout the "Plant Based Diet".
Are these plant based diets beneficial/required for losing weight? If so what resources exist for creating and planning meals using those diets as a guide? 

A:

"Sick Fat Nearly Dead"  is basically an advert for Crossâ€™s [lead] wellness program. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/movies/fat-sick-nearly-dead-a-diet-and-road-trip-movie-review.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=1
"Forks over Knives" uses the lowest levels of scientific evidence for its conclusions and decision making. https://rawfoodsos.com/2011/09/22/forks-over-knives-is-the-science-legit-a-review-and-critique/
"The Engine 2 Diet" is simply just processed high-carb/fat foods brings you dietary cholesterol down, which has been debunked as a important thing to do. http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4449967.ece?shareToken=7dba4f3ccd918bfcc1a900e04c14f6bb
If you want to lose weight then eat less. http://examine.com/nutrition/what-should-i-eat-for-weight-loss/
If you want to be healthy and lose weight then eat healthily and eat less through counting calories (Fruit, vegetables, non-processed foods, low sugar, moderation). 
It's really that simple.
