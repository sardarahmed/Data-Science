Q:

Do presymptomatic people test PCR-positive

I know that RT-PCR testing can detect coronavirus in symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers.
I was wondering whether a presymptomatic carrier (I don't know if the terminology is correct, but I mean someone for which the virus is in the 'incubation period') would test positive with RT PCR testing ?
Sorry if this is off-topic, I haven't been able to find answers on the internet.

A:

Presymptomatic patients with coronavirus may test positive with RT PCR (see: Kim, Jeong et al. Viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients. Int J Inf Dis Vol.95, P441-443, June 01, 2020.) Presymptomatic patients may also be infectious (see: Bai Y, Yao L, Wei T, et al. Presumed Asymptomatic Carrier Transmission of COVID-19. JAMA. 2020;323(14):1406â€“1407. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2565)
I hope this answers your question. Best regards
