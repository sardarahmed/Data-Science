Q:

Is brown sugar better than white for diabetes?

As we know that diabetic patient does not eat sugar(white sugar) because the blood sugar level is not controlled.So,can a diabetic patient use brown sugar in replacement of white sugar? can brown sugar not effect the blood sugar level of diabetic patient?

A:

Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients can eat sugar under specific conditions. 
White and brown sugar are pretty much identical (from a "diabetic" viewpoint) and they respectively have a Glycemic Index of (+-10) 68 and 64 according to the Linus Pauling Institute.
So as a summary, no. Brown sugar affects the Blood Sugar level of a Diabetic patient similarly to white sugar.
