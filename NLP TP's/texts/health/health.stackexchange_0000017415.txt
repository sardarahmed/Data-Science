Q:

Does halving the quantity of an oil-based time-release intramuscular injection medicine also require halving the time between dosing?

In order to half the administered dosage of an oil-based time-release intramuscular injection, does that also require halving the time between dosing?
For example, if the initial dosing was:
1ml = 5mg weekly

and the quantity is divided in half to 0.5 ml, would that require the new frequency to be
.5ml = 2.5mg twice weekly

or
.5ml = 5mg twice weekly

or
.5ml = 2.5mg weekly

A:

The intramuscular injection has rather erratic pathways of a drug absorprtion. Moreover the drug absorptions rate depends on a drug type and a target organ. 
However for a purpose of illustration of the point raised by OP a simple 
 pharmacokinetic model (y-axis - concetration, x-axis - time in hours) could be considered:

You can see that the amount of drug injected takes roughly the same time to absorb for different concentration values.
As an answer of the OP's question, halving the administrated drug dose will not halve the inter-administration periods. For further details please consult Pharmacokinetics
