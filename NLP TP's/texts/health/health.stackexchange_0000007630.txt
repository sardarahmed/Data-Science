Q:

How to reduce weight-caused man boobs (psuedogynaecomastia)?

I have lost weight recently and although I've come within the normal BMI range, but the "sagging/bulky chest" of mine (a legacy from my fatter past) makes me feel ashamed of myself in public.
I was reading about this problem online and learned that its called gynaecomastia irrespective of whether its caused due to hormonal imbalance or due to a fatter adolescence.
So, I have the following questions:

Is my understanding correct that my condition's clinical name is gynaecomastia?
What can I do to get rid of this "saggy/bulky chest" of mine?

This link, in response to the question "Is there anything men can do themselves?", says that working out to  develop ones chest muscles only ends up making the breast look bigger. 
Is this true? If yes, is there really no way for me to get rid of this "saggy/bulky chest" of mine except for a cosmetic surgery?

A:

No, gynecomastia is a hormonal condition in which mammary tissue develops and enlarges in a male. Pseudogynecomastia is the word for what you're describing.
How do you know what you have is only pseudogynecomastia? Have you consulted a doctor and know for sure? If not, you need to stop looking for solutions and look for the cause first. You can't solve it if you don't know for sure what it is. If you do know for sure it's pseudogynecomastia, then weight loss, exercise and surgery are your available options. Don't worry about getting bigger pectoral muscles that will make them look bigger. Developing big pectoral muscles like a bodybuilder takes a lot more training than most people realize. There's little danger of that, but some judicious weight training will tighten up the underlying muscle and reduce the saggy appearance.
