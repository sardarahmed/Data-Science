Q:

How do we differentiate the truncus coeliacus from the superior mesenteric artery?

How do we differentiate the the truncus coeliacus from the superior mesenteric artery when looked at from an MRI in the axial plane? For example, the images that I attached, how can I differentiate 8 from 51? I cannot see a difference. (Source of images: Imaging atlas of human anatomy, Weir & Abrahams')

A:

Youâ€™re right that the origin of these two vessels can look similar where they branch from the aorta.
One way to distinguish them is the level of their origin:

The celiac trunk, also known as the celiac artery, is a short vessel that arises from the aorta and passes below the median arcuate ligament, just as the aorta enters the abdomen at the level of the T12 vertebra.

The superior mesenteric artery is the second major branch of the abdominal aorta. It originates on the anterior surface of the aorta at the level of the L1 vertebrae, approximately 1 cm inferior to the celiac trunk and superior to the renal arteries.

So it is the relationship to other structures that distinguishes them. In the context of moving through MRI slices it becomes more apparent.
Moving superiority to inferiorly:
Coeliac trunk -> SMA -> renal arteries (x2)

Edit
If only static images are available, it is more difficult, particularly if the images are from different people, due to anatomical variation.
Looking at this diagram, the coeliac trunk itself bifurcates shortly after branching from the aorta. The SMA moves inferiorly and anteriorly in a more straight path. This would make 51 the SMA and 8 the coeliac trunk. This would fit with the liver appearing smaller at the more inferior level of the SMA.
