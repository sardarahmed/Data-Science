Q:

Effect of turmeric/curcumin to block estrogen and hence reduce gynecomastia

If we search the internet, we see plenty of articles 

https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/Turmeric.html, 
https://examine.com/supplements/curcumin/, 
(Video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZJTk9Re3Qc, 
(Video testimonial) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNdPeR8tSj0, 
https://www.fixmanboobs.com.au/the-anti-gynecomastia-powers-of-turmeric/) claiming that the ingredient curcumin in turmeric is an effective estrogen blocker, and hence can be used to reduce gynecomastia (male breasts).

There're also few studies that're more technical in nature and hard for a person who isn't a medical specialist to understand, e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354546/
So I'd like to know by further existent studies, if turmeric is effective in decreasing estrogen level in male body, and hence reducing male breasts or gynecomastia? Thanks in advance!!

A:

The following comprehensive scientific sources do not even mention any relationship between turmeric/curcumin and gynecomastia:

Turmeric, Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, komen.org
Turmeric, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
Curcumin: A Review of Itsâ€™ Effects on Human Health, PubMed, 2017
Curcumin, Examine.com, 2015
Google .gov: or .edu: search for turmeric or curcumin + gynecomastia

The youtube videos and fixmanboobs.com.au site mentioned in the question are not backed up by any references.

The PubMed article from the question mentions that curcumin can inhibit estrogen receptors and thus decrease estrogen activity but it does not say if this has any health effects.

In conclusion, there seems to be no scientific evidence to support the claim that turmeric/curcumin helps to reduce gynecomastia.
