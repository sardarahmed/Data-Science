Q:

Does exercising lower your lifespan?

I read that the consumption rate (Cal) of stronger muscles while resting is higher than that of less dense muscle tissue.
Kleiber's Law and Rate of Living Theory states that organisms have circa the same heartbeats per lifetime (~one billion [which still has some exceptions])
Also assume that the extra exercise is counteracted (by augmented caloric input or something) so that the benefits of exercise is disregarded.

If you don't live shorter because of it, then why?

A:

Persons who do regular physical exercise have a lower heart rate while they are resting (or not exercising):

Hence, their hearts will be beating same number of beats over a longer period of time.
In addition, a number of trials have shown that regular physical exercise is associated with significant health benefits and lower incidence of serious health problems, e.g.:
