Q:

What factors influence the memorization in a young adult?

I am a currently a 23 year-old pre-med student and I am worried because I tend to forget things easily.
To give you some examples: in class, I miss out on a lot of the information and in my every day life, I can't remember names of movies, actors. Things "slip out" of my mind a lot.
I have realised that distraction makes it even worse. 
Interestingly, if something is logical, it will stick in my brain, but if its pure memorization, I most likely won't remember it.
I would like to know which factors influence the memorization in a young adult?

A:

Memory is a complex cognitive function which relies on several neuronal pathways. Without wanting to go into too much details, the process of memorization is dependent on three different steps: encoding, storage and retrieval.
Different brain regions are involved in the process of memorisation: hippocampus and mamillary bodies are the main brain regions (which get also affected in Alzheimer's Disease or Korsakof Disease) but other regions have been reported to be involved in the process such as the striatum or the amygdala.
As complex as it is, the different steps of memorization can be influenced by diseases but also by different other "factors" such as (non exhaustive list):

Emotions/Motivation/Mood: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16371950, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656292/
Sleep (eg sleep deprivation): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23589831
Attention: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9460740
Drugs (eg cannabis): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19630708
Caffeine consumption: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3222359
Diet: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805706/

So to summarise: difficulty in memorization can be multifactorial. You might wish considering one of those above mentionned factors and try to work on them.
P.S: you tagged your question with "dementia". I have already answered a similar question for someone aged 30-40, you might have a look here: Dementia in late 30s, early 40s? Tests?
