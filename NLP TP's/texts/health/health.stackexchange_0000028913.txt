Q:

What are the websites providing medical articles?

I'm new here and I'm not sure if my question is off topic, however I need some resources about medical articles concerning the effect of covid on health employees.
I found a website called sci-hub but it's illegal and can't access it in UE.
I just want to know if there are some resources providing medical articles for free.
Thanks.

A:

There are several open access journals and collections that you can search.

The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Open Access network.
The New England Journal of Medicine allows open access to certain articles.
Several journals in the Lancet family are open access.
The British Medical Journal has an open access counterpart, BMJ Open.

Also, for many articles, the authors will happily share a copy with you if you email them and ask politely. Since they're busy, it might take a while for them to reply, but at least with academics, many are happy to share their work.
