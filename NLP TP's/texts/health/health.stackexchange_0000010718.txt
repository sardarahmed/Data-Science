A:

Generally, Diabetes Mellitus is categorized into Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational diabetes.The type that you are concerned with is type 2 in which genetic factor plays a major role.

Type 2 diabetes is a disease that is fundamentally caused by a mismatch between our genetic makeup and our lifestyle choices, namely diet and physical activity. Numerous genes have been identified as risk factors. Among them about 10 genes are thoroughly studied for their causative etiology. Variations in these genes confer some impairment in insulin secretion and/or utilization, glucose and/or lipid homeostasis.Source

Many cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or the onset delayed, through positive lifestyle changes. It is estimated that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be reduced by up to 58% by maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active and following a healthy eating plan.
There are numerous ways of preventing the diabetes:

Maintaining a healthy weight
Regular physical activity
Making healthy food choices
Managing blood pressure
Managing cholesterol levels
Not smoking.

Talking about exercise, it helps to decrease obesity, helps your body increase its sensitivity to insulin. Muscular activity induces glucose entry into muscle cells without the need for insulin. As such, exercise has insulin sparing effect.
