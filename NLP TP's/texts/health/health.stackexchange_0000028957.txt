Q:

Risks to quick vaccine development?

I've heard that the longer a virus is in a population the less deadly it becomes. Something about deadliness being selected out from generation to generation.
Had me thinking that with the speed of vaccine development for Covid-19 that the virus may no longer have time to settle into that more benign phase.
Is there any truth to this?

A:

Unfortunately, there's no rule about viruses getting weaker. In fact the original SARS-CoV-2 was less deadly than some of the newer variants.  In any case, SARS-CoV-2 has pretty much run rampant around the world even with the development of vaccines.
