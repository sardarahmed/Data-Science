Q:

Medications for asthma

What are the medications that are available for treating asthma? Do they have any side effects or long term effects on the patient's body?

A:

There are long-term medications, those that will get asthma under control:

long-acting beta-agonists: bronchodilators, they open the airways
leukotriene modifiers: they block the components that cause inflammation
mast cell stabilizers: they prevent / reduce the release of chemicals (from your body) that cause inflammation
theophylline: is a bronchodilator, used to prevent nighttime attacks
immunomodulator: when you have asthma that is allergy-related and hasn't respond to inhaled medications

Each kind has one or more available drugs, and each one can have different side effects, specially on the long term.
