Q:

Can this product kill coronavirus?

I'm really really confused what product to buy to clean my laptop body to disinfect it from coronavirus.
Like most doctors say use 60-70% alcohol based sanitizers to clean your hands.
So does it mean only alcohol based things should be used to clean electronics like laptop and mouse bodies?
When searched a lot on Google, I found one product by Lysol here. On this page it is not mentioned that it can kill coronavirus. But here is something which makes me think that an Lysol wipes can be used to disinfect it from coronavirus virus. Lysol is listed there.
So can I use this product to disinfect it from coronavirus?
One more query related to same: I've always been afraid that cleaners that kills viruses can be bad for our personal health. For example, I'm not sure if we use hand sanitizer properly that kills 100% coronavirus, we should again wash our hands before eating? (Because this sanitizer might be toxic?)?
Same doubt is about Lysol. If I clean my mouse with it and it kills all the bacteria. And then I use my mouse and eat with same hands, can it be toxic and make me sick/dead?

A:

The EPA has a list of products known to be effective against COVID-19.  I can't tell you if your Lysol cleaner is one of them -- the list includes 14 different products sold under the Lysol brand, using five different active ingredients.
Any cleaning product should have instructions on how to use it safely.  As long as you follow those instructions, both you and the newly-cleaned object should be safe.
