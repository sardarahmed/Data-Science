Q:

basil cancer on outer ear-tight glasses maybe the cause?

Can tight glasses cut the circulation to the outer ear? Thus making the outer ear fresh oxygen blood starved and it then be more susceptible to basil cancer? i have currently been diagnosed with basil on the flap of my ear. I would bet that most of the people who are diagnosed with this kind of cancer wear glasses.

A:

First, it is basal cell cancer/ basal cell carcinoma (BCC) whose leading cause is generally thought to be from sun exposure/solar radiation (1).  
Second, There has been absolutely no research into this hypothesis, nor could I find any research into circulation being cut off to ears and thus making them more susceptible to basal cell cancer. 
Do you have any research that suggests/supports your thoughts?
Here is a really great summary paper written for the Journal of American Academy of Dermatology outlining most of the history, presentation, typical costs and summary statistics (what we currently know) about basal cell carcinoma.
