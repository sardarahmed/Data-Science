Q:

Exercise and stretches to help me reach my feet

I used to be very fit, but my lifestyle has slowly become more sedentary so that I am now overweight and very inflexible
Because of this I am having more and more difficulty reaching my feet to put shoes and socks on and off, and to wash them and keep my nails trimmed
What I need is a regime of stretches that will make me more supple and flexible, so that I can "touch my toes" with improved ease
I would have thought the primary joints involved in this would be my hips, but I'm open to any suggestions
Is there anyone who can advise me?

A:

I am not sure about physiotherapists, but one solution that is over thousand years old is Surya Namaskar, or Sun Salutations.
One rep = two sets of yoga poses that give you a total body workout.

If you are someone who doesn't like to exercise, or is short on time, Surya Namaskar is definitely for you.
Recommended daily is 54 reps = 108 sets (according to Hindu numerology)
Gradually build up your endurance and stamina. I am currently at 33 reps and I notice improved flexibility and strength.
Correction
One set is the 12 yoga poses that work both sides of the body.
Aim for 108 sets of 12. As of Aug 2016 I am on 72 sets of 12.
