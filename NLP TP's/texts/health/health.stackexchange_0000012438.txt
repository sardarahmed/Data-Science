Q:

Can Viagra cause a spontaneous erection?

I was watching T2 Trainspotting movie, where Franco took too many Viagra. Franco is involved in a chase scene between him and his rival Mark. After the thriller chase is completed he takes a look in his pants, and notices his penis got erected without him knowing it.
Does this happen in the real world too? 

A:

Viagra does not cause a spontaneous erection. You have to be sexually stimulated in order for it to take effect. This particular film scene would suggest that Franco was sexually aroused by the 'chase'. 
Hope this helps clear things up for you.
