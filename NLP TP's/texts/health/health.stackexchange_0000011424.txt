Q:

How dangerous are cracked teeth?

Common accidents can lead to tooth injuries. A tooth that has fallen out obviously needs a dentist, but cracked teeth are on a line between important and ignorable. How does this type of injury affect the patients' health? What are the potential consequences of leaving a cracked tooth untreated?

A:

More dangerous than healthy teeth, but not impossible to live with. A cracked tooth has a higher risk of breaking, is less resistant to tooth decay, heat, cold, acid etc. The 2 most dangerous situations I can imagine:

If the weakened tooth breaks apart, its parts can be as dangerous as shards of glass in the mouth.
If the injury leads to osteomyelitis, it might require a surgery.

I'm not a doctor, I'm just guessing: if your tooth is cracked, see your dentist ASAP, as each case is unique.
(The photo in the question is my cracked tooth. I had an accident almost a year ago, landed my face on concrete, visited my dentist, used 25 g Elmex gel as she recommended. I still don't use this tooth, so fortunatelly it's still in its place and is painless.)
