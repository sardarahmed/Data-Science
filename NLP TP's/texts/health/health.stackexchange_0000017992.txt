Q:

Chikungunya joint pain

Chikungunya can cause joint pain. Is it true that there is no treatment for Chikungunya joint pain? How do patients normally cope with it?

A:

It is true that there is no treatment for the Chikungunya virus and infection. That is not the same as there being no treatment for the pain. The CDC recommends acetaminophen but not aspirin or NSAIDs for the fever and pain.  
Wikipedia says:

Symptoms usually improve within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months. The risk of death is around 1 in 1,000.

People either cope with the pain for a week or more, or take Tylenol for it until it goes away.
