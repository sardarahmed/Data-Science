Q:

Are vitamin C and desloratadine better absorbed when taken shortly after eating?

I'm taking vitamin C supplements and desloratadine for my allergies. 
I've heard some people saying that it's better to take your medicines right after eating because your body absorbs them better then. 
I couldn't find any studies on the internet which would prove them either wrong or right. 
So I'm still wondering whether my medicines will have a better effect if I consume them with food. 
Will they really work better when taken with food? If so, why?

A:

Desloratadin is slightly soluble in water and very soluble in ethanol. While that would often indicate an at least slightly better if time-delayed absorption with food, this is apparently not the case:

Following oral administration of desloratadine 5 mg once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ngÂ·hr/mL were observed, respectively.
Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of desloratadine.
