Q:

Extreme bleeding - what shuts down first?

Considering an accident that results in heavy bleeding (say legs are crushed), but no internal damage to the brain or torso, what would stop first: the brain or the heart? Is there an order to organ failure from loss of blood?

A:

It's actually not terribly complicated. The heart will stop first.
In the scenario you describe, the heart will continue pumping until it runs out of blood to pump, and it may even continue pumping activity after that even though there's no blood to move. This is called pulseless electrical activity (PEA), previously known as electromechanical dissociation (EMD).
After blood flow to the brain drops below below levels sufficient to maintain consciousness, the person will fall unconscious. The brain will not be dead but injury may begin occurring. Once blood flow to the heart drops below levels sufficient to keep it functioning, it will stop completely (asystole) or go into ventricular fibrillation, both of which mean no blood is being pumped and it will be quickly lethal if not treated immediately. At this point, the brain will begin to die.
The time difference between when the heart stops and brain death occurs is measured in minutes, commonly estimated at about 8 minutes. But the answer to your question is that the heart will stop pumping before brain death occurs.
