Q:

How can Spinraza be effective on peripheral motor neurons outside of the spinal cord if it cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier?

I have SMA type 3. I had four intrathecal Nusinersen injections but I had no noticable improvement. I have doubts about its effectiveness outside of spinal cord, because we know that Spinraza can not permeate BBB.
How can Spinraza be effective on peripheral motor neurons outside of the spinal cord if it cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier?

A:

Spinraza (Nusinersen) is injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid adjacent to the spinal cord (intrathecal) where it diffuses freely into the spinal cord. Its mechanism of action is to replace a missing protein through alternative splicing (quoting from the same Wikipedia article):

Nusinersen modulates alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, functionally converting it into SMN1 gene, thus increasing the level of SMN protein in the CNS.

That means the drug needs to be where RNA is formed and spliced: the nucleus of the cell, found at the cell body. The cell bodies of motor neurons that project to muscles are also located in the spinal cord.
So, the drug is injected right to the compartment where it's active. No blood brain barrier to cross. It wouldn't do anything useful for motor neurons peripherally because the peripheral part of the cell isn't the part of the cell where the drug is active. The muscle cells peripherally are also not a direct target of the drug.
The forms of SMA that are treated by Nusinersen/Spinraza involve the death of spinal motor neurons that lack functional SMN protein. I do not believe these drugs are expected or intended to reverse SMA symptoms; rather, they prevent further death of these cells and therefore prevent progression of the disease.
