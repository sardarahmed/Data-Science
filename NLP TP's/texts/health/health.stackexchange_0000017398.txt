Q:

Is it safe to store medicine/supplements in containers

I bought a box of supplement strips (Natberry plus) that consists 100 tablets. I feel it's inconvenient to store the tablets strip in my bag as it tablet comes out by accident sometimes. So i thought i can store all the tablets in a container.
Is it safe to store these tablets in an air tight container? Is it safe to take medicine/supplement out from the strip and store it in a container in general?

A:

If they're stored in blister packs it may be that this is to control the humidity for the tablets which may be particularly hydroscopic.

PRODUCT INTEGRITY
This same protection improves product integrity and extends its shelf life. Consider that most consumers store their drugs in bathrooms where temperatures and humidity can be harmful to unprotected drugs. Unlike with the use of bottles, which are opened and closed by consumers multiple times, exposure to compromising elements occurs in blisters only when the protective barrier is broken and a single tablet or capsule is dispensed and administered.

You can of course cut the strips into tablet sized and store them in the bottle still blister wrapped.
