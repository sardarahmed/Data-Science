Q:

What causes sudden stabbing back pain?

Many of us will have experienced a sudden intense back pain, often caused just by turning sharply or reaching for something rather than anything physically arduous. The pain gradually diminishes over the course of a few days and doesn't recur. I have Googled for information on this, but back pain is such an extensive area it's hard to make sense of the flood of information. A common theme seems to be muscle spasm, but comments about this tend to be vague.
So my question is: assuming there is no underlying medical condition, like a slipped disk, what exactly goes on when you experience this apparently random intense back pain?

A:

The causes of such pains are called back strains, and may be muscular or ligamentous in origin.
It may be caused by:

Physical exertion
Fall
Bending repeatedly
Lifting heavy objects
Emotional Stress
Sitting in improper postures for long periods of time

This happens when a muscle/ligament is overstretched, resulting in the injury of the same. Since spine is essentially supported by a large number of muscles and ligaments, this can happen very easily. If there is an injury, the area around it gets inflamed, and these will lead to spasm of the muscles. Hence the movement of the spine in such conditions will be extremely painful.
The treatment modalities are usually conservative, including rest, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and physiotherapy when needed.
