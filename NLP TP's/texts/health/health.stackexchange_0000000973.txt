Q:

My friend accidentally drank camphor water and also swallowed a piece of camphor

A friend of mine drank camphor water today he also swallowed a small
  piece of camphor.

I searched for the side effects in google it is said that after taking directly by mouth in 5 to 90 minutes vomiting will be occurred and also in some case it will also include to death. 

I'm happy to say that my friend didn't get any vomiting but he is saying that his stomach is having some burning sensation to some extent,that means is he safe now or any medical
  advice needed??

A:

Call the emergency services or the anti-poisoning centre right away. Don't waste your time looking for effects on the internet.
Keep calm, and:

Tell your name, phone number, location, 
Tell this is for a poisoning, and tell the victim's gender and age
Tell what was swallowed, how, how much and how long ago
Don't hang up the phone before instructed to do so

They will guide you and tell you what to do, should something needs to be done.
Don't take any initiative outside the instructions you will receive. 
Don't give water, don't give milk, don't to try to make the person to vomit, don't give any medication, and ask the person not to move.
I'll elaborate (and reference) this answer further later should the question be reopen once made more general, but in the interest of the victim do this right now, even if he/she seems to feel good.
