What are the health effects of drinking 1 beer a day? How bad would this be for my body and would areas of my health and life would this affect? Long term as well as short term.

A:

Drinking one bear is actually not bad. It is called moderate drinking and in a nutshell, it is defined as consuming one drink a day for women and two for men. However, if you don’t drink now, you should not start drinking for health.  A healthy lifestyle, including good nutrition and exercise, offers more benefits than moderate drinking. Another important point is that if, as a man, you choose to have two beers a day, it does not mean it’s okay to guzzle one after the other. Drinking just two beers -- or any alcoholic drink -- in one hour impairs judgment and doubles your chances of having a traffic or household accident.
There are several long and short-term effects of alcoholic consumption but they are determined by the number of drinks taken per day.
