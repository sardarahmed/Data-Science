Q:

Meaning/Abbreviation of IAAD IA & IAADIADOO

Did anyone ever come across any procedures/tests that starts with IAAD IA or IAADIADOO (Test for specific Pathogen). If yes, can you please tell me what does that IAAD IA or IAADIADOO mean or stands for? For example, IAAD IA GIARDIA, IAADIADOO Influenza tests, etc.
To keep it simple I am working to find some good procedures/medical tests for a patients to understand their patient journey for specific indications like UC & MS. I see a good amount of patients going through these tests that starts with IAAD IA/IAADIADOO along with the pathogen they are looking for. For example there is a CPT code associated for the test IAAD IA GIARDIA, which I believe is basically the test to diagnose giardiasis.
But I want to understand what exactly the IAAD IA stands for or the meaning behind it. There is no info in Google regarding this.

A:

These look like they are from CPT codes ("Current Procedural Terminology"; these are billing codes). They probably come with a numeric descriptor; you're looking for a "long descriptor" for that code.
IAAD is "infectious agent antigen detection"; IA is "immunoassay". DOO is "direct optical observation".
I found it by searching "IAADIADOO", which led me to a particular CPT code "87804", which led me to this PDF:
Commonly Ordered COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV Clinical Diagnostic
Laboratory Tests for which Medicare Allows One Test Without a
Practitioner Order During the PHE*
which gave the long descriptor:

Infectious agent antigen detection by immunoassay with direct optical observation; Influenza

You're probably better off starting with the actual codes, and looking for them directly, rather than trying to find them from the acronym. Contrary to "there is no info in Google", I found this in Google in just a couple minutes.
