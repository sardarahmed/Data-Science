Q:

How to deal with dehydrating medicine

If a person is dehydrated by something that cannot be gotten rid of, and drinking a lot of water solves some parts of dehydration but not others, due to losing the water by freqent urination, what might be some potential treatments to look into or ask the doctor about?

A:

Excessive urination (more than 3 liters of urine per day) is medically called polyuria.
Causes include:

Excessive drinking
Taking diuretic pills
Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes insipidus due to various brain or kidney disorders

A doctor will want to know:

What is an estimated amount of urine per day?
Any other symptoms, such as hunger, fatigue, etc.?
When did the problem start?

The doctor will then likely order various blood and urine tests to check for diabetes mellitus and other disorders. The doctor needs to make a diagnosis first, so at this point there is not much to discuss. The doctor can tell how much to drink.
