Q:

How can we digest protein, fats and carbs at the same time?

I read that carbohydrates need an alkakine environment to be digested while protein and fats need an acidic one, so how can the human stomach handle both at the same time ?

A:

Acidic environment in the stomach (ph ~2) is necessary for the activity of the enzyme pepsin, which partly digests proteins to peptides (NCBI).
"Alkaline environment," which is not really alkaline but rather less acidic or nearly neutral with pH 6-7.4, (PubMed) is in the small intestine, where carbohydrates, fats and peptides are digested.
