Q:

What are these syringes called?

I have a syringe that looks a lot like this. I'm not using it for medical purposes, but rather to create vacuum and pressure in hoses for testing out fuel delivery in small motors. When I look up syringes to buy it usually comes up with what are called "Luer taper", "Luer-Lok" and "Luer-Slip (registered trademarks), or generically "Luer-Lock" and "Luer-Slip". These look very different from the image posted above. If we take a look one example of a "Luer-Slip" syringe, they usually look like this:

The first problem being (for my purposes) that the syringe tip or opening is larger than I would like, and the second is that it's not tapered. I would ideally need both (tapered and smaller) to jam them into hoses/lines to get a decent seal. 
Does anyone know what these type of syringes are called? I'm trying to search for them at different places. 
The one I have and the one in the first image are curved, I don't know if they have a particular name, but I only need a straight one.
As another example, here are some sold on eBay:

The one on the left is close to what I'm looking for, but I would want a tapered tip beginning from a smaller size at the tip so I can slide it into a tube and get a good seal.

I think you are looking for irrigation syringes - I'm familiar only with the curved variety but at least on a google images search I see straight ones as well.
That said, I've always used luer-style syringes with an appropriate fitting when using syringes in an equipment context. Major catalog parts suppliers have plastic and metal fittings with just about every conversion you can imagine. For example, if I were testing hoses, I'd get a hose barb fitting.
