Q:

is RADIO-SIGNAL Jammer safe for health?

Recently, I had to overview some WiFi technologies, and then wanted to check RADIOSIGNAL-BLOCKER hardware (a.k.a. WiFi/Cellural-Signal/Bluetooth/ Jammer).
We needed to use that technology to block mobile-phones in our hall, to avoid noise during some important events..  But I was interested, if it is harmful for peoples health (for example, averagely 3 hours a day it will be turned ON in our office).
thanks in advance

A:

Assuming you're in the U.S. and the jammer is mounted atop your building, you need to do an environmental assessment if your transmit power is over 1000 watts. However, as Carey Gregory mentioned, if you're jamming signals in the U.S., you have other legal problems (and you will be jamming signals at 1000 watts). If you're planning on mounting the jammer in the building itself, I don't think you can use the rooftop limits--you would likely need to use the other equations in the document I linked.
I'm only addressing RF-burn risk here. Whether RF radiation has any effect on cancer incidence is an ongoing much-disputed research topic.
