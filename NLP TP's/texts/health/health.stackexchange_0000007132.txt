Q:

If I take probiotics and antibiotics at the same time, which one wins?

Okay, I couldn't resist that title.
Seriously though, since antibiotics can cause indigestion, many physicians recommend taking them with food (see How much food is necessary to buffer the stomach when taking medicine?).
Is it okay to take them with yogurt (aka yoghurt and yoghourt)?  Does that reduce (or intensify) the effectiveness of the antibiotic?

A:

That depends on the sort of antibiotics. E.g. Tetracyclines interacts with Ca2+ and so its absorption is massively reduced see here, while other do interact less.
Generally you can say, that you should never take drugs with milk or milk derivatives.
