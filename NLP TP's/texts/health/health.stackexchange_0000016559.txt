Q:

Why is Tradozone prescribed to aid with insomnia?

Per Wikipedia article:

Many clinicians use low-dose trazodone as an alternative to benzodiazepines for the treatment of insomnia. Two recent reviews found that trazodone is the second most prescribed agent for insomnia [...]

Is there any scientific explanation of the mechanism in action?

A:

Pharmacology: Inhibits reuptake of serotonin, causes adrenoreceptor subsensitivity, acts as a 5HT2a receptor antagonist and induces significant changes in 5-HT presynaptic receptor adrenoreceptors. Trazodone also significantly blocks histamine (H1) and alpha1-adrenergic receptors.
Insomnia (off-label use): Oral: Immediate release: Usual dose: 50 mg to 100 mg at bedtime (Kaynak 2004; Roth 2011; Walsh 1998). Doses up to 600 mg have been evaluated in patients with insomnia associated with depression (typical ranges of 50 to 300 mg); however, the quality of the evidence precludes definitive conclusions of efficacy (Mendelson 2005; Sateia 2017). Additional data may be necessary to further define the role of trazodone in this condition.
Simple Summary: Mechanism of Action--> Trazodone blocks H1 receptors. By blocking those receptors the effect is (usually) drowsiness.
