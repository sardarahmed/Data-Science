Q:

If you are told you're going to have a heart attack in one month, what can you do now to prevent it?

If an unhealthy individual were given this news, could they make enough life style changes in a single month to prevent an impending heart attack without medical intervention?  What would be the first steps in undergoing this transformation?
Editing to make my intent more clear: The basics behind preventing cardiovascular disease are fairly straightforward, but the situation I'm trying to propose is what can be done with someone that is right on the edge?  For example: for a good portion of the population jogging a mile would be considered a healthy activity.  Does that remain true for the individual above?  How do recommendations change when you're that close to the brink?

A:

There's very little you could do in terms of lifestyle changes. Quitting smoking, stopping excessive drinking, and stopping the use of stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines are the only things I can think of that would have fairly immediate results, but I doubt it would be enough to prevent that arterial plaque from rupturing that's going to cause the heart attack. The time to prevent that was lifestyle changes 30 years ago.
What I would do if I had such information would be head to the best interventional cardiologist available and ask for a full workup and aggressive treatment of any pending problems they find.
