Q:

Are computers bad for health?

I am a CS student, so my career requires sitting for long periods of time (8~9) hours infront of a laptop daily. I've been hearing for quite a long time that computers are harmful for health. I'm really concerned with my health but I'm  comfortable with this lifestyle.
Is there any proof that computers are harmful and/or they cause serious health problems ? Are there any health problems that are specific to some types of computers that no more exist with modern hardware ?
Clarification
I'm interested in physical and cognitive/brain problems alike.
Cognitive problems are more important in this case.
Examples of physical problems likely for long-time computer users:

Back bending.
Eye-sight damage.
Less energy consumption problems (because of sitting all day) like sleeping problems.

Examples of cognitive problems likely for long-term for computer users:

Loss of attention.
Cognitive effects of learning computer programming

A:

Like all things too much of anything is bad for you. As a designer working in the tech industry for over a decade, here's a few things I experienced and that might (I hope not) impact you. 

wrists from over use of keyboard and mouse
circulation problems from being seated for too long
eye sight
posture problems
social effects of not going out and socializing but using social media to socialize (which isnt really socializing)
