Q:

What makes mint feel painful?

By what mechanism does mint create a sensation similar to coldness or pain in one's mouth?  Why would this sensation become less and less over time with repeated exposure to mint?

A:

If anyone sees this for whatever reason (I guess if you look up this question...), the pain has gone away after me forcing myself to use mint toothpaste and other mint products.
