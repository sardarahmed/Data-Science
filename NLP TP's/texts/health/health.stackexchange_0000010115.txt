Q:

Is baking soda effective in absorbing hair grease ("dry wash") if one is unable to wash their hair w/shampoo for whatever reason?

When I was a youngster & a teenager, I had several ear surgeries, and I was not able to wash my hair for several days (just sponge bath the rest of the body). I always have had long hair, and it's blonde, so when it's not washed... it's very noticeable (especially as a teenager, I was very concerned with my appearances). 
I recall that my mother brought out the baking soda from the kitchen, and did a "dry-wash" of my hair because it was just so greasy/oily and disgusting and I had to go to Junior High. 
My memory escapes me, but how effective is baking soda in keeping the hair looking clean and fresh (if one is unable to use shampoo or conditioner)? How does it work? 

A:

No, No and no...
A simple google search for the words "baking soda hair" reveals:

"Baking soda may cause long-term damage and hair breakage"

People use baking soda + vinegar to clean combs and drains...
Don't put it on your hair unless you look like Bruce Willis and going bald might be cool.
