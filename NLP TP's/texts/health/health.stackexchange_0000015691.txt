Q:

Replacing bedding and underwear for hygienic reasons

Many sites claim that bedding and underwear should be thrown away for sanitary reasons every few years (the exact recommendation varies between sites and clothing/bedding type). 
This, regardless of the laundry routine they endure. So for example, even if you wash your underwear at 60°C with bleach every day, they should allegedly be thrown in the garbage every year for sanitary reasons.
How does this make sense? Why does the item's age matter? Isn't a 5-year old item (pillow/underwear/duvet/etc) as good as new, hygienically speaking, after being washed with a detergent at 60°C? Do you mean to tell me things get "too contaminated" over time, to the point where they are a "sanitary lost cause" and must be thrown away and replaced? 
Note that I'm only talking about the hygienic perspective. For the sake of this discussion let's ignore things like loss of functionality, comfort, aesthetics, etc.

I agree with the comments in that article.  It's rubbish.
Does the NHS toss their bedding every few years??
To get rid of dust mites

Wash bedding weekly. Wash all sheets, blankets, pillowcases and bedcovers in hot water that is at least 130 F (54.4 C) to kill dust mites and remove allergens. If bedding can't be washed hot, put the items in the dryer for at least 15 minutes at a temperature above 130 F (54.4 C) to kill the mites. Then wash and dry the bedding to remove allergens. Freezing nonwashable items for 24 hours also can kill dust mites, but this won't remove the allergens.
