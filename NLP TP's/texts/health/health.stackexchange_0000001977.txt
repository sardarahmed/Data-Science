Q:

How does removal of the gallbladder affect life expectancy?

Is the gallbladder really just a rudimental organ? If I undergo cholecystectomy, will my life expectancy be shorter than normal because of that?

A:

This is very good and pragmatic question. I will answer no.
First of all, there are no studies to date which would have investigated the life expectancy after cholecystectomy. Of course this statement can be hardly profoundly backed up, but if you search PubMed with "cholecystectomy AND "life expectancy", none of the studies will look at this issue.
There is a NICE guideline and a recently published review article in NEJM, which does not take any stance about the long term disadvantages such as reduced life expectancy after cholecystectomy. Moreover, laparoscopic cholecystectomies have been performed since 1985 and open cholecystectomies since 1882. 700 000 cholecystectomies are performed annually only in the US.
Considering that cholecystectomies have been performed more than 130 years and the total number performed only in US is probably some where around +10 mil, I am fairly certain that if this operation would indeed have definitive adverse long term effects, they would have been even suggested if not partly shown by some investigator some where to date.
Finally, even tough some investigator would stated that cholecystectomy is associated to reduced life expectancy, according to Hill´s principles we should also be able to have some sort of plausibility in order to have causality between these two. I can´t up some up with reasonable plausibility at this moment....
