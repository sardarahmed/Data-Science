Q:

Do seizures result from an excess of electrical current or electrical voltage in the brain?

It is well known that seizures result when the brain encounters more electrical activity than it is able to handle. Is the primary cause related to an excess of electrical current, electrical voltage, or something else (e.g. frequency)?

A:

Here's a brief overview of the types and characteristics of seizures:

Epileptic Seizure:
Is characterized by "torrents" of electrical discharges by groups of neurons. 
 This temporarily blocks any other neural signals from reaching the CNS.

You may lose consciousness, fall stiffly, and have uncontrollable jerking.
Epilepsy is not associated with intellectual impairments
Epilepsy occurs in about 1% of the population according to the American Epilepsy Society.
Genetic factors play a role, but brain injuries, stroke, infections,
or tumors can also be causes.

Aura (Sensory Hallucinations)

May precede seizure - some people report they can "feel it coming".

Absence Seizures 

These are also referred to as "petit mal"
Mild seizures of young children: expression goes blank for few
seconds

Tonic-Clonic Seizures (formerly grand mal)

Most severe; last few minutes
Victim loses consciousness, bones broken during intense convulsions,
loss of bowel and bladder control, and severe biting of tongue
