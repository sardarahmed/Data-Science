Q:

What is the name of this disease, it's cause and cure?

I suffer from the following condition:
Mainly in the rainy season sometimes from being asleep I wake up. But neither I am able to open my eyelids, nor move any body part. But I am fully conscious. I struggle to move my fingers. After a few minutes with extreme effort and associated unbearable pain I am finally able to move my body parts and open my eyelids. Why this takes place and what is the cure?
NOTE: My maternal grandmother and mother also suffer from this condition.

A:

Likely it's sleep paralysis in the hypnopompic state. It's not uncommon and has a hereditary component. Drug therapy is not that useful, and it may just require some cognitive therapy.
