Q:

Minimum Salt Intake

I am researching salt intake for the elderly.
According to WebMd (http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20100624/90-percent-in-us-get-too-much-salt-5-foods-blamed)
Americans on average should get a maximum of 1500mg sodium = .75 teaspoon salt
Middle aged, elderly, and African American should get maximum 2300mg sodium = 1 teaspoon
But there is no documentation on minimum intake requirements.
What is the minimum sodium required for the elderly and what is the minimum sodium requirements for the young?

A:

Recommended Dietary Allowances: 10th Edition

A minimum average requirement for adults can be estimated under
  conditions of maximal adaptation and without active sweating...to 115
  mg of sodium or approximately 300 mg of sodium chloride per day. In
  consideration of the wide variation of patterns of physical activity
  and climatic exposure, a safe minimum intake [of sodium chloride]
  might be set at 500 mg/day [~200 mg sodium/day]

So, for adults (young or old), the minimum requirement is about 200 mg (0.2 g) of sodium per day or even just about 100 mg (0.1 g) without active sweating.
