Q:

Is eyebrow hair loss common in hyperthyroidism?

I have seen many articles talking about hair loss in regards to hypothyroidism but very few about hyperthyroidism. People suffer from hair loss in both thyroid diseases, but is it common to lose hair from the eyebrows while on carbimazole for treatment of hyperthyroidism?
I mean both, hair loss because of the carbimazole or because of the hyperthyroid disorder. 

A:

The condition that you're asking about is called in the professional terminology: "madarosis" (but see the picture that I attached). As many proffessional books states, it's common in hypothyroidism, and they don't say it about hyperthyroidism. Then it make sense that it's not common in hyperthyroidism. But in medicine always can be exceptions. 
Regarding to the side effect of carbimazole, according to this source which rely on FDA report, there is no such side effect of carbimazole, and obviously it is not common as well.

There is no Madarosis reported by people who take Methimazole yet. We

  FDA. Find out below who they are, when they have Madarosis and more.
