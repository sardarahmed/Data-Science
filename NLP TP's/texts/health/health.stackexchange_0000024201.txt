A:

In mammalian cells the gene NKX2-5 is found on chromosome 5, more specifically on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position 35.1. (Cytogenetic Location: 5q35.1)
NKX2-5 is ~3,213 nucleotide bases long and is involved in biological processes that give an organism its shape. Disruption of NKX2-5 has proven to cause abnormal heart shape.
