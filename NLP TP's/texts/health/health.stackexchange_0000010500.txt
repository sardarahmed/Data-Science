Q:

Is there an official public list of US physicians?

Where do Healthgrades and Vitals get their physician list from? Is there a publicly available central repository? 

A:

There are several sources for publicly available health practitioner databases. One of the most common sources is from the US government, which assigns a National Provider Identification (NPI) number to all medical practitioners. There is an online database you can use here:
https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/
Enter a doctor's name, and you'll see a lot of information about them.
