Q:

Green Tea After Dinner

Where Im from (West Pakistan), there is an old tradition of serving Green Tea after dinner, which is meant to burn the oil & help with digestion. 
From what I have read, we should drink liquids before the meal, not after. 
Is there is scientific proof that green tea has any benefits, when taken after a meal? Shouldn't we be drinking it before rather than after?

A:

Green tea has thermogenic properties and promotes fat oxidation  beyond that explained by its caffeine content per se. If green tea extract are drunk during the meal there is a proved effect of it on fat oxidation.
