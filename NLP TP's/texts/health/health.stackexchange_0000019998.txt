Q:

Videos of surgery

Where can I find a website which contains videos of open trauma (HD if possible)? I want to accustom to these views (because I am a medical student).

A:

Top quality resources for videos will be found at sites from surgical academies, which often offer free or low-price subscriptions to students/residents/trainees:

American College of Surgeons curriculum for residents at https://cine-med.com/acsonline/
American College of Surgeons Journal at https://www.journalacs.org/featuredvideo
Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery at  https://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/Pages/videogallery.aspx
Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons at https://www.sages.org/video/
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists at https://cfweb.acog.org/onlinevideos/

Other sites I have not thoroughly explored but appear to offer quite a bit:

Regarding desensitization to blood, surgery, trauma, deliveries, and the like, watching videos definitely will help.  However, there is nothing that can replace the real thing - especially when you are actively involved in the cutting, cleaning, suctioning, retracting, stretching, etc.  Be very aware of this, and consider spending time shadowing in the ER or OR as an observer (i.e. able to leave at any time) before you need to take an active role in the procedure.
Therefore additionally, I want to encourage you that if you are expected to be part of a surgical team and know there is a possibility that you may experience nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness, or syncope: it is your professional and ethical responsibility to inform the chief resident and/or attending, as well as the circulating and/or scrub nurse, so that they can plan for your replacement if anything happens. 
Secondly, the second that you notice symptoms or feel you are becoming overwhelmed, it is imperative that you tell the person who will replace you, hand over your task, and remove yourself from the surgical field.  Sit right there on the floor if you have to, but try to avoid (1) faceplanting into the open surgical field of the patient's body or (2) fainting in the trauma bay or OR and hitting your head on the tile floor, becoming a trauma patient yourself.  I had classmates with such stories and it was horrifically embarrassing for them.  
Instead, be more like a certain medical student who told their attending and the circulating nurse that they'd done extensive desensitization training but this was their first real surgical case.  So then after a prolonged surgery with heavy blood loss, when they overheated after sweating for hours in the scrub suit and began to vaso-vagal, someone was already scrubbed in to take over for them immediately - and they could remove themselves to a safe spot to sit.  Rather than be humiliated by contaminating the field or becoming a patient themself, they were thanked for being responsible and self aware.
