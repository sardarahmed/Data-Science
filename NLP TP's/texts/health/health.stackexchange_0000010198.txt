How to treat blood-shot eyes if I don't have Visine eye-drops? Water good or bad idea?

A:

Bad idea. Tears are not water, so water will simply wash them away and cause increased irritation. There are various folk remedies you can try such as placing teabags on your eyes, but in general if you don't have eye drops, removing the source of the irritation that caused them is the only option.
