Q:

Medicines in the fridge

Why are there some medicines that are put in the fridge?
Thanks

A:

Chemical reactions are slowed down at lower temperatures; refrigeration can increase the shelf-life of medicines that would not last long enough at room temperature.
Refrigeration could be important for the active ingredient or for the formulation as a whole.
Note that refrigeration can also be a problem for some formulations, so it's important to follow storage instructions.
The effects of short-term failure to refrigerate drugs that are supposed to be refrigerated varies, see Cohen et al. 2007 for a compilation of manufacturer instructions for a variety of drugs.
