Q:

Why is Diarrhoea (or, Diarrhea) not classified as a Vector-borne disease?

I was reading that diseases such as Cholera & Typhoid are Vector-borne diseases wherein the Vector transfer the harmful bacteria to contaminate our food/water, causing the disease in humans.
By the same analogy, Diarrhoea (or, Diarrhea) too is caused when Rotavirus contaminates one's food/water. And obviously some agent (vector) would be needed to carry the Rotavirus to that food/water. Then why isn't Diarrhoea too classified as a vector-borne disease?

A:

While I do agree with previous answer suggesting that diarrhea is a symptom rather than a disease, I would like to add the following:
According to the WHO, diarrhea is defined as

the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more
  frequent passage than is normal for the individual).

While, infectious causes (virus, bacteria, parasite) are the most frequent aetiologies for diarrhea, other conditions can lead to diarrhea such as:

drugs (laxatives, antibiotics) that lead to an inflammation of the
mucosa and therefore to an alteration in liquid absorption/secretion 
in the intestine
inflammatory bowel diseases
neoplasia (colon cancer)
malabsorption diseases such as celiac disease
