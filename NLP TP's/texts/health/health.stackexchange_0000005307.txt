Q:

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) really helps in Weight loss or not?

I have been searching on web to figure out that CLA really helps in weight loss or not. 
Some of the posts says its beneficial but some are contradictory suggesting that those are not helpful in any way to loose weight.

A:

It does! This has been proven by reserach.
"Long-term supplementation with CLA-FFA or CLA-triacylglycerol reduces BFM in healthy overweight adults." - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15159244 (BMF means fat in your body.)
"CLA reduces body fat but not body weight in healthy exercising humans of normal body weight." - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11725826
From examiner.com: "CLA is a supplement that has shown good results in rodents for weight loss however (like many bogus products) these studies have not been reliably replicated in humans." In my option, this is not true, as I shown in my previous answer. To take or not? Though question. Some reserach found it's safe and great, other found the opposite. I would try to obtain it naturally from grass-fed beef and Raw Grass-Fed Dairy, here I included some of the best sources of CLA:
Food Sources of CLA:
Food - Mgs. Of CLA/gm of total fat:
[30 - Grass-fed (G-f) Beef
20 - 30 - G-f Whole Milk
20-30 - G-f Cheese
5.8 - Lamb]1
