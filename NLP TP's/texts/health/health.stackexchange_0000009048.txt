Q:

Can thinking too much lead to brain damage?

I would like to become a mathematician, but am scared by the fact that for instance, Leonhard Euler developed what seems to be called a "cerebral hemorrhage", and he was perhaps the most prolific thinker of mathematics. Now I would like to know: If I use my brain too much, will it suffer from similar stuff, for instance, because there is too much blood flow in the blood vessels of the skull?

A:

No

A cerebral hemorrhage (also spelled haemorrhage) is a type of
intracranial hemorrhage that occurs within the brain tissue. It can be
caused by brain trauma, or it can occur spontaneously in hemorrhagic
stroke. Non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (or hemorrhagic stroke)
is a spontaneous bleeding into the brain tissue because of rupture of
blood vessels that may be caused by high blood pressure, amyloidosis (Amyloidosis is a rare, serious disease caused by accumulation of proteins in the form of abnormal, insoluble fibres),
or structural weakness of blood vessel walls (aneurysms,
arterio-venous malformations).
