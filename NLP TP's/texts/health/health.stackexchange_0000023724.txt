Q:

Has China announced any results from their massive (new) COVID-19 testing program in Wuhan?

About 10 days ago China announced a plan to test the entire population (~11 million) of Wuhan. And more recently they've announced testing over 1 million per day in the city. But have any results been announced? I.e. any cases found in the city using this massive effort? (I'm aware they had a new small cluster in the city that triggered this round of testing.)
Also (should be related enough) are there any details known on whether their actual PCR testing can/could keep up with the sample collection? (I.e. does 1 million-plus tested per day mean just samples collected or actual PCR test done too.)

Wuhan Tests Nearly 10 Million People in 19 Days, Finding Just 300 Coronavirus Infections
(BEIJING) â€” The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late last year, has tested nearly 10 million people in an unprecedented 19-day campaign to check an entire city.
It identified just 300 positive cases, all of whom had no symptoms. The city found no infections among 1,174 close contacts of the people who tested positive, suggesting they were not spreading it easily to others.

Given what's happening in the US and other places in the world, I personally don't believe this number. But, this is what Time says, I just report it.
