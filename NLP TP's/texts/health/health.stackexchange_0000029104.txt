Q:

Terminology for vaccinating with multiple vaccines?

If one were to be "fully vaccinated" with 2 doses of the Pfizer for COVID19 and then six months later vaccinate with the Moderna version: What is the word or phrase to indicate such a protocol?

A:

The "CombiVacS" trial used the term "heterologous vaccination schedule", and several other papers cited by that one also use "heterologous":

You'll find similar terminology of older studies regarding other vaccines but I wouldn't guarantee that other descriptions aren't used, as well, using common English language.
