Q:

Why do I wake up so many times in the middle of the night

I am 31 years old and for many years I wake up between 5-8 times at night and I have to switch from one side to another. I don't have any issue of falling back to sleep. 
For me it feels that I am very agitated, other persons that slept with me told me this also (because I move a lot in bed) 
Is this a sleeping issue ? If yes, what can I do about it ?
What I want is just fall asleep and when I wake up is morning.  
And I must say I am not stressed at all with anything and I am a very chill and relaxing person.

A:

AFAIK: It's pretty normal as long that you don't have trouble getting back to sleep.
Try to google 'sleep cycles' to learn more about how the brain functions. Basically we have, I recall, 4 stages of sleep. Stage 4 is what is known as REM sleep, and this is where vivid dreaming happends, stages 3 is deep sleep and so on ...
The point I'm getting to, is that a complete sleep cycle will take approx. 90min, and after a complete cycle you're back at stage 1, where you'll be mildly awake again.
Info is based on recollection and might not be 100% accurate.
Cheers,
