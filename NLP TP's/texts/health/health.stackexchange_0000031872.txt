What medical professional specializes in the diagnostic evaluation of and treatment of permanent taste loss?

A:

The US National Institutes of Health notes:

Both taste and smell disorders are diagnosed by an otolaryngologist (sometimes called an ENT), a doctor of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck. An otolaryngologist can determine the extent of your taste disorder by measuring the lowest concentration of a taste quality that you can detect or recognize.
