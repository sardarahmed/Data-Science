Q:

Is this nutritional information wrong?

I am attaching the pictures of the ingredients and nutritional information of a chicken wrap. I am very surprised by the value of the carbohydrates, since it is much higher (around 50) for other wraps of the same brand, same size etc, just different ingredients. 
Do you think it is a typo? 

A:

Yes, it is a typo. 100 g of this wrap has 161 Kcal:

Fat contributes 9 Kcal x 4.3 g = 39 Kcal
Protein contributes 4 Kcal x 12.3 g = 49 Kcal
Because there are 161 Kcal in total, the remaining 73 Kcal needs to come from 18.25 g of carbohydrate (4 Kcal/g).

(Fat = 9 Kcal/g, protein and carbohydrate = 4 Kcal/g)
