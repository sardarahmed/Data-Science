Q:

Does being born between 1945 and 1965 increase your risk of Hepatitis C?

I read that being born between 1945 and 1965 increases a person's risk of Hepatitis C. What is the evidence behind that?
This is the website I found it on:
http://www.cdc.gov/features/HepatitisCTesting/

A:

The site you found that on is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's generally considered an authoritative source. The site states the following:

There are high rates of Hepatitis C in people born during 1945-1965. 
  People born during 1945 through 1965 are 5 times more likely than
  other adults to be infected. In fact, 75% of adults with Hepatitis C
  were born in these years. The reasons why baby boomers have the
  highest rates of Hepatitis C are not completely understood.

In support of that statement, they include a link to further information (PDF). Note that in this document they mention possible reasons for the Baby Boomers to have such a high prevalence:

Hepatitis C is primarily spread through contact with  blood from an
  infected person. Many baby boomers  could have gotten infected from
  contaminated blood  and blood products before widespread screening of 
  the blood supply in 1992 and universal precautions  were adopted.
  Others may have become infected  from injecting drugs, even if only
  once in the past.  Still, many baby boomers do not know how or when 
  they were infected.
