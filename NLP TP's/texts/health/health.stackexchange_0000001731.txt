Q:

Administering Anti-biotics to elderly people

Is there anything wrong in administering antibiotics to a patient as old as 65, twice within 2 months? The patient had boil in the arm-pit the first time and was required to take the antibiotics, 4 times a day, consecutively for five(5) days. Most recently, the boil re-appeared again and the same medication has been suggested again. 

A:

Giving the same antibiotic whithin a short time does possibly increase the risk of  drug resistance so you should generally consult a doctor in this case. The boil re-appearing is also not the best sign, as could mean that the previous eradication was not successful. You may need an other drug or surgical approach.
