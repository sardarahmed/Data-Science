Q:

What is the process for removing moles (cancerous or non-cancerous) from skin?

Moles are underneath or in the deeper parts of the skin I believe. Do they use lasers or something? How do they prevent or try to prevent scarring?

A:

There are actually a few ways that moles are removed.
Cutting it off
Sometimes moles can be "shaved" off if the cells don't go very deep. Other times, the mole cells will be deeper in your skin, so the doctor will have to make a deeper cut to prevent it from coming back (like taking a weed out by its roots). The deeper cuts will usually require stitches. This process is called 'excision'.
In cases where the mole is suspected to be cancerous, this is always the method used - usually a full excision is performed to make sure no potentially-cancerous cells are left behind.
Freezing it off with liquid nitrogen
A small amount of liquid nitrogen (which is extremely cold) will be placed on the mole. A small blister might form, but it will heal by itself.
Burning it off
An electric current is passed through a wire which will burn off the upper layers of the skin (where the mole is) off. Can require multiple treatments.
