Q:

How does HIV infect people?

If a person had sex with multiple people and none of them were infected with HIV,
would it cause the generation of HIV in his/her body?
Does sex with multiple partners lead to the generation of HIV?
As heard and read about HIV many people say "Only if sex partner is infected with it,  you are going to get it". But the question is, how is that partner infected? 

A:

You can only get HIV from someone or something already infected. This includes humans, needles, breast milk, etc. HIV virus must come in contact with a damaged or open tissue.
CDC.gov 

You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most
  commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and
  needle or syringe use.

You must have the infection to transmit it. Multiple partners increase risk, but only transmit if one partner already has infection. 
How does a person get HIV? From someone or something already infected. If we go back to the first person infected then:

They believe that the chimpanzee version of the immunodeficiency virus
  (called simian immunodeficiency virus or SIV) most likely was
  transmitted to humans and mutated into HIV when humans hunted these
  chimpanzees for meat and came into contact with their infected blood.
