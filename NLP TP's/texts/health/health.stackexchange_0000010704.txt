Q:

How does a skull mend after a surgery?

After a craniotomy, a large piece of a man's skull may be removed.
That bone piece has to be put back, right?
How to fix it and the bone piece can join the skull normally as it used to be?
There may be different methods as the bone piece's size may be different.

A:

The article you cited answers your question.

The amount of skull that needs to be removed depends on the type of
  surgery being performed. The bone flap is then replaced using titanium
  plates and screws or another form of fixation (wire, suture, etc.).
