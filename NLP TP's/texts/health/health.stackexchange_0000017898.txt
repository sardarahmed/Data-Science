Q:

Why does one have to use warm water with water flossers (e.g., Waterpik)?

I read in a few places that one has to use warm water with water flossers (e.g., Waterpik). Why wouldn't cold water be ok too?
E.g., from https://www.waterpik.com/oral-health/blog/waterpik-mouthwash/ (mirror):

all you need in your Water Flosser for clinically proven effectiveness is warm water

Ted:"all you need in your Water Flosser for clinically proven effectiveness is warm water"
Ted:Where is the study proving the clinical effectiveness?
Aleecia :I would be glad to help answer. We recommend warm water as to not cause unnecessary irritation.
Ted:How is warm water more clinically effective than other temperatures?
Ted:Or is the clinical effectiveness independent of the temperature, and warm water is only recommended for the comfort factor?
Aleecia :The only reason why we recommend using warm water is because it may cause less irritation. Purely a comfort factor.
