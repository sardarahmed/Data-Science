Q:

Does this Covid-19 vaccine study suggests a 1 to 718 rate of adverse effects?

As I have not much skill in reading medical research, I wanted to verify my calculation of this research result.
A big peer-reviewed research paper entitled Safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine in a Nationwide Setting measured occurrence of adverse effects among vaccinated people, up to 21 days after each shot, vs the unvaccinated control group, and generated these results:

The sum of excess adverse effects in the vaccinated group is 139.3 per 100,000 persons.
Does this mean an adverse effects rate of ~1 to 718? Can the accuracy of this calculation be improved?

A:

I am neither a medical professional nor a statistician, so caveat emptor and all that
Short answer is no.
This is because, in the article the authors state:

A total of 1,736,832 persons were eligible for inclusion in the vaccination cohort...

...The vaccination cohorts included a mean of 884,828 vaccinated persons, with a median age of 38 years

If you compare these to the numbers of persons in the adverse events cohort column recorded for each category, then you can see that a sum total of persons (22,080,670, if my maths is correct) would be well in excess of the enrolled cohort. This means that each reported event is not independent and it is likely that a person who had one adverse event also had at least one other reported event.
Thus, a simple sum of the excess events is not something that can be performed. Indeed, if this were the case, the authors would likely have done so in the paper, but they did not, leading to the conclusion that it is not a valid technique.
Now we must consider that adverse event risk ratios are calculated for vaccines and other medicines, so there must be some methodology to do so, but what that methodology is, I don't know though I suspect an odds-ratio calculation of some sort.
Note that the authors only considered some of these events to be a significant difference, even if the risk ratio or risk difference were higher than expected, so they excluded parathesia (tingling/prickling sensation) as well as vertigo (dizziness), but it looks like the excluded ones are all minor symptoms not associated with a general morbidity/mortality:

The risk was substantially higher on either the multiplicative (risk ratio) or additive (risk difference) scales in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group for myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2).

They also note the risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in general and in figures 3 and 4 of the paper comparing to the risk with vaccination:

Infection substantially increased the risk of many different adverse events, including myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95% CI, 3.95 to 25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 5.6 to 15.8), acute kidney injury (risk ratio, 14.83; 95% CI, 9.24 to 28.75; risk difference, 125.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 107.0 to 142.6), pulmonary embolism (risk ratio, 12.14; 95% CI, 6.89 to 29.20; risk difference, 61.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 48.5 to 75.4), intracranial hemorrhage (risk ratio, 6.89; 95% CI, 1.90 to 19.16; risk difference, 7.6 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 2.7 to 12.6), pericarditis (risk ratio, 5.39; 95% CI, 2.22 to 23.58; risk difference, 10.9 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 4.9 to 16.9), myocardial infarction (risk ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.47 to 9.95; risk difference, 25.1 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 16.2 to 33.9), deep-vein thrombosis (risk ratio, 3.78; 95% CI, 2.50 to 6.59; risk difference, 43.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 29.9 to 56.6), and arrhythmia (risk ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 3.07 to 4.95; risk difference, 166.1 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 139.6 to 193.2).
