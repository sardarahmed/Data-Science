Q:

Side effects of ivermectin and anti-hypertensive drugs

Are there any side effects when the drug Ivermectin and anti-hypertensive drugs are taken together? I'm only asking out of curiosity. I worked briefly as an intern with US-AIDS for the control and eradication of onchocerciasis in West Africa.

A:

Ivermectin (Stromectol) is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent with macrocyclic lactones structure, Ivermectin acts by interfering with nervous system and muscle function,in particular by Binding GluCls ion channels (1) in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells,produces paralysis, death of parasite.(2)
Medications that interfere with P-glycoprotein( multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)) have the potential to effect on systemic/CNS exposure of Ivermectin and its elimination.(3),(4),(5) 
hypertension drugs like verapamil,reserpine,diltiazem and etc plus other Heart Disease medications like amiodarone and warfarin can interfere with above mechanism , its important to say this interaction not known as contraindication or serious interactions
but categorized as Significant interactions which needs close monitoring so there is no need for drug alternation unless you see significant side effects in the patient .(6),(7)
Drugs that have serious interaction with Ivermectin are ivacaftor
and quinidine ( in every form and combination).(6),(7)
