Q:

How much Vitamin D does the body produce if you're out for a whole summer day?

Imagine that a person is outdoors the whole day in the summer. They're tanned enough that they don't get sunburn. How many IU (International Units) of bioavailable Vitamin D do they produce in a way?
To provide a more specific scenario: Consider an average summer day in Berlin, where an average-sized male wears pants, but nothing above the waistline. The amount of tan is the amount that the average inhabitant of Berlin develops if he's constantly out during the summer in the same outfit.
I'd also be happy to hear other specific examples.

A:

Vitamin D is produced in the skin by UV irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol. But vitamin D in the skin is also broken down by UV irradiation and this leads to a maximum equilibrium level of vitamin D in the skin of the order of 25,000 IU (different sources will give different figures of this maximum value, The vitamin D council says it's between 10,000 and 25,000 IU).
But this does not mean that you can get 25,000 IU per day from the Sun, because it takes a few days for the vitamin D in your skin to be transported to the liver where it gets converted to calcidiol. The maximum daily dose of vitamin D you can get from the Sun is estimated to be about 10,000 IU/day, see e.g. here. So, if you expose your body to UV radiation from the Sun for the first time since last summer, then you can produce 25,000 IU in your skin, but by the next day only 10,000 IU will has been taken away from there, this means that with 15,000 IU still left in the skin you can only add 10,000 IU until you're back at the maximum of 25,000 IU.
This also means that to get a high dose of vitamin D, you don't need to expose your skin to the Sun every day. If we pretend that lower amounts of vitamin D in the skin don't affect the speed at which it is removed, then the body would be able to extract 20,000 IU in two days from the 25,000 IU, the amount of vitamin D left under your skin is then 5000 IU, exposing your skin to the Sun will add back that 20,000 IU. In reality, with lower amounts of vitamin D in the skin you'll extract less from it per unit time, so you won't get 10,000 IU/day if you go into the Sun every other day, but it's not going to be a factor of two lower as one could naively expect.
