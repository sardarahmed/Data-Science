Q:

How exact are the times for how long to wait between pills?

A 120mg pill of Sudafed (Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride), for example, lasts for 12 hours. You are not supposed to take another Sudafed pill before the 12 hours are up.
How exact is this 12-hour limit? Do i have to wait at least exactly 43200 seconds between pills? How much leeway is there? Could i take the second pill a few minutes (5? 10? 30?) before the time is up?
Note that Sudafed is used as an example here. The same should apply to any other drug with a time limit.

A:

Good question though a broad one! 
Well, it all depends on the 'pill' or 'medicine' you are on. Different medicines have different half-lives. And 'half-life' is the factor that mostly decides the 'dosage/timings'. 
But, if you go by general guidelines, all doctors agree upon one thing:

Take a missed pill the moment you remember it. But then, if it is almost the time for the next dose, skip it. That said, don't ever take two pills together (compensating the missed dose).

The best practice is ask your healthcare provider about it. They can precisely tell you what should you do (though most of them would advise what I wrote).
