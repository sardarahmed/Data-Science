Q:

Should I use headphones when I have hearing loss?

I googled this query but all I got was that loud music on headphones causes hearing loss.Now I use headphones sometimes and I had hearing impairment from when I was a kid.Should I altogether stop using it?

A:

If you have sensorineural hearing loss and regularly use headphones, you might be listening to a louder volume than if you did not have hearing loss.  This may mean you could be subjecting your hearing apparatus to potentially damaging thresholds. 
Hearing aids are not just fancy headphones. They are sophisticated aural rehabilitation devices that are tuned to an individual's hearing loss. New, digital hearing aids also have other advanced technologies such as directional sound detection, filtering, among many others.
