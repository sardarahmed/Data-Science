Q:

Is eating refregerated home cooked food daily bad for health?

I cook food on Sunday in bulk quantity, enough to last me lunch and dinner till Wednesday (sometimes Thursday if I had to skip for outside food in between).
I separate everyday meals in rubber maid plastic containers and keep it frozen in the refrigerator. When I want to eat it, I heat it in microwave.
I have been following this schedule everyday and would like to know if this has any adverse effects on my health(or rather anyone's health in general)?

A:

Prepared food is typically good for 3-4 days in the refrigerator
food safety guidelines 
Frozen is is even longer.
It would be cooled (not frozen) in a normal refrigerator.  
Healthy depends on the food.  Home prepared food can be healthier than prepared food (especially fast food) that can have a lot of fat and salt.
