Q:

How to cure a dry eye

My friend's sister has a dry eye, she has tried using eye drop but to no avail, pls what else can she do to cure the dry eye and what caused the dry eye

A:

Mild to moderate cases of dry eye syndrome can usually be treated using lubricant eye treatments that consist of a range of drops, gels and ointments. These lubricants are often called artificial tears because they replace the missing water in the tear film. For more information on other treatments for different other causes, visit the website below.                                                     http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Dry-eye-syndrome/Pages/Treatment.aspx
