Q:

Medical database with symptom frequencies

Is there a large medical database with symptom frequencies for diseases? I.e. the percentage of patients with a specific disease that have specific symptoms?
For example (numbers and symptoms made up by me):
Barrett's esophagus: 

longstanding heartburn 81.3%
dysphagia 72.5%
hematemesis 38.1%
unintentional weight loss 20.9%

COVID-19:

fever 51.2%
fatigue 17.1%
dry cough 66.0%
sneezing 26.2%
malaise  8.5%

The answer should not be several research papers that contain two or three different diseases with symptom frequencies each but a proper database containing hundreds if not thousands of diseases with symptom frequencies.

Nature Communications have such a database.

They count the number of times a disease and a symptom keywords both appear on the same PudMed article, and assign a TF-IDF value to each pair.
In their words:

Acquisition of symptom and disease relationships
The association between symptoms and diseases were then quantified using term co-occurrence (number of PubMed identifiers in which two terms appear together;
