Q:

How do you get infected with HIV?

If someone has unprotected sex with a woman who had other sexual partners before will that cause HIV? 

A:

What should I take care of while sleeping with another woman to protect her against AIDS?

Get tested and go see you doctor. CDC.gov:

No HIV test can detect HIV immediately after infection. If you think
  youâ€™ve been exposed to HIV, talk to your health care provider as soon
  as possible.

It takes 3-12 weeks after initial exposure for testing to be able to detect antibodies. Contacting your doctor can help you by him/her explaining risk and possibly giving you medication that can decrease risk. Both get tested so your status is known.
Abstainng or utilize protective sex methods. Abstaining can cut out all possibilities of exposure, unless blood pathogens are involved. Safe Sex with condoms, etc simply decrease risks.
Risk-Reducing and HIV
Notify her of your exposure. This can help her be aware of the possible repercussions and prepare for what testing she may need. 

I am afraid if I have sex with my wife it will cause her to have AIDS?

You could give her HIV, which is the virus that leads to AIDS.
Follow through on doctor visits and testing to confirm whether or not you were infected.
