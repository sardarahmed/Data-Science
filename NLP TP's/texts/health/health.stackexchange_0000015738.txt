Q:

What resources are available to identify oral medication?

What databases are available to visually identify oral medication found without packaging?  Are there different databases for US, European, Far East, etc?

A:

There are several "pill identifiers" available online:

RxList
WebMD
Drugs.com (international database from 185 countries)

You enter the shape and color of a pill and any imprints and you get the pictures with drug names.
There are apps for mobile phones:

ID My Pill
You take a photo of a pill and you get the info.

Or you go to a search engine and type "recognize my pill" in or so.
ResourcePharm.com has a page: "Identify Foreign Medicines" with links to lists of drugs in various countries.
