Q:

Can non-visible light still have effect on your eyes?

I am in the process of building a device that will track eye movement via a camera. To light the eye I am using an array of infrared LED's and my camera is sensitive to IR light.
After using the device for several hours today (testing and the like) I have noticed a slight headache similar to eye strain but only in the eye that I have been testing with.
My quesion is as my eye is constantly having a bright IR light shone in it, but I can't percieve it as it outside of my visual spectrum, are there still parts of my eye that are sensitive to this kind of light and might be strained/damaged by this?
It could very well just be a normal eyestrain headache (as I am sat at a computing while doing this work) but I would rather be armed with more information before I continue this work (as this product might be tested on people other than myself)
Thanks!
Edit
The light being sent out has a wave length of 940 nm

A:

I'm an Electrical Engineer not a doctor but I've some knowledge about IR. Although you can not see it, IR is electromagnetic waves and it carry heat to your eyes. So, The eyes is negatively affected without your knowledge (If there is too much Infra red).
It is similar to ultraviolet that damage the skin although it is invisible rays.
I don't know the cause of your headache because I'm not a doctor. But high power IR is dangerous for the eye. Don't look at it for long time.
