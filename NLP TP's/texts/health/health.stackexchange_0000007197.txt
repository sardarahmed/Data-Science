Q:

Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab Test- normal or abmormal

I had a variety of test ran on my thyroid and I'm waiting to see the DR. My question is the TPOAb reference rang is 0-34. Mine came back as 9 IU/ml. Is this still considered normal or abnormal? I also have a family history of HyperT and HypoT (not sure if that matters) Thanks. 

A:

Normal. A result of 9 where the reference range is 0 - 34 indicates that you're within the normal range. For this test, an abnormal result would be a value over 34 because it's not possible to have a result below zero. 
Keep in mind that each testing lab can different reference ranges, and they can differ over time too.
