Q:

Why doesn't WHO think wearing mask is protection measure for COVID-19?

In WHO official website "What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?", it doesn't mention that wearing mask an effective measure to protect people. 
I don't understand why wearing mask is not good way to prevent infection of COVID-19. 
Is it just because masks are out of stock?

A:

CDC website:
Blanks labels

PPE is the least effective control because it involves a high level
of worker involvement and is highly dependent on proper fit and
correct, consistent use.

e.g. The likelihood for untrained personalto properly use PPE is not realistic, so it would be negligent of the WHOto suggest this to the public for this use.?
This does not address reducing transmission. Though, masks, used by those untrained, are not realistic in halting the spread.  One method that has proven to halt the spread is self-quarantine (both healthy and non-healthy) and social distancing and the other recommendations listed in the link provided.
