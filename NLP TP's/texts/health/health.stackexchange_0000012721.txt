Q:

What kind of implant abutment is it?

My dentist has discovered an implant of unusual shape, see two x-rays of the same area,

To the left there is a normally-looking implant, but the other one seems unusual, the abutment does not seem to fit the main screw. Have anyone seen this shape of abutment before? Is this a defect in installation, or is this a special kind of implant design?

A:

It appears that this is an Ankylos brand implant system.
It also appears that the thin neck of the abutment, while having some advantages of reducing area where microbiology might get in (due to minimized implant-abutment junction), is having some structural mechanical weakness, see this blog. An opinion is that this system should not be recommended for mandibular molar implants, due to large ratio of
of occlusion surface to the size of abutment base.
