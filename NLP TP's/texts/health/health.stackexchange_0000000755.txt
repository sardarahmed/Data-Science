Q:

Can I hear ultrasounds?

I have noticed that every time I am in the same room as an operating ultrasound machine, I can hear it. And not the machine making noises, but the actual ultrasounds (I know because it decreases in intensity after the gel is added).
'Ultrasound' refers to sound waves with a frequency too high for humans to hear (Wikipedia). Except, it seems, for me.
Simply, my question is, "Is this normal?"

A:

It is likely you are not hearing the ultrasound itself (typical frequencies are upwards of 1 MHz, far beyond what the human hearing system is capable of detecting).  You are probably hearing coil whine from the electronics -- switched-mode power supplies in particular tend to operate towards the upper end of the hearing range, and the intensity of this sound changes as the power consumption does (eg. when the imaging system goes from "idle" to "active").
