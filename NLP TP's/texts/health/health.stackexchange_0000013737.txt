Q:

How to discover allergies to certain foods?

Sometimes it is hard to find food allergies. Wheezing or any side affects but the root cause may not be known.
Is there a good way to find food allergy?

A:

Some people might recommend that you could have a diary of foods consumed and when symptoms of allergies occur, and by eliminating causes one by one, whatever remains will be the food you are allergic to. 
If symptoms of the allergy include a difficulty of breathing or eye/lip or throat swelling, do not do this, under no circumstances, but go straight to the doctor.
You might have a potentially deadly anaphylactic shock if you suddenly consume a lot of the allergen (by trying to eliminate other causes). Apart from that, this method is unreliable and will take a long time.
Tests
Multiple allergy tests exist, and depending on your insurance and location, healthcare providers might cover the tests for you.

Basically, thereâ€™s no way around getting together with your GP and discussing this matter. The GP will advise you which test to take.
