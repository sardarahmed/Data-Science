Q:

Contraction-to-contagion duration for covid-19?

I've read that the incubation period of the covid-19 virus ranges from 2 to 14 days with rare exceptions (e.g. here). However, a person carrying a virus could theoretically be contagious and transmit it without themselves having developed symptoms. My questions:

Can carriers of covid-19 infect others before developing noticeable symptoms themselves?
If so, what's known about the duration from the time of infection to the time the carrier becomes contagious?

A:

To question 1, infection of others before symptoms of the carrier
Yes, carriers of Covid-19 can infect others before developing noticeable symptoms themselves.
There is a study to a very traceable transmission chain in a company in Germany. Person 1 was infected from a from China comming person 0 after January 19, 2020. 

A person 3 had contact only with person 1 on January 20 and 21. However, person 1 had first symptoms on the January 24th, so the infection occurred 3 days before symptoms of the carrier. 
Another person 4 had also contact only with person 1 from January 21 to January 24. This infection occurred within 0 to 3 days before person 1 first symptoms.

This study can be read in detail here: https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2001468.
There exist also an interview with person 1, which states that he met person 0 on Monday (January 20).

Person 0 doesn't show symptoms of illness during their presence. Symptoms were established on their return trip on January 22, so person 1 was infected 1 to 2 days before symptoms of person 0. 

The interview is readable here: https://www.br.de/radio/bayern1/coronavirus-in-bayern-100.html.
To question 2, duration until the carrier becomes contagious

The above study shows that person 1 infected person 3 already after 1 to 2 days after infection themselves.

In addition, there is an study to 312 infections in Austria about the serial interval which  refers to the time between successive cases of transmission. 

According to this study, carriers of the virus contribute significantly to an infection already after day 1. The risk of transmission is highest on day 3 and after 10 days the risk of transmission drops significantly, but is still present.
