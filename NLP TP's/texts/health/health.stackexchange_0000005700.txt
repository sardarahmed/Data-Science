Q:

MR scanner versus MRI scanner

To designate a device that performs magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is the proper term MR scanner or MRI scanner?

A:

There is no consistency within the industry on the terminology. For example, GE calls them MR systems, Philips calls them both MR system and MRI system, Toshiba calls them both MRI system and MR system, and Siemens calls them MRI scanners.
