Q:

How much sleep do adults actually need?

The common consensus is that most adults should get 8 hours of sleep a night.
However, sleep needs are highly variable, with some people needing more to function properly, and some gaining little benefit past just a few hours. I'm trying to learn more about the statistics here.
I'd imagine sleep needs would fit a normal distribution, with a median of around 8 hours and a standard deviation of around an hour. The empirical rule would then put 68% of adults in the 7-9 hour range, 95% in the 6-10 hour range, and 99.7% in the 5-11 hour range, but that's just a guess.
Has this distribution been studied, and where?

A:

Many well-done newer studies are supporting the theory that quality trumps quantity when it comes to sleep.  This excellent article at lifehack.org lists 12 good sources, including “two studies (which) assessed how sleep quality and quantity affected college students’ health and well-being. The studies concluded that sleep quality was a better predictor for a healthy and happy life and improved well-being than sleep quantity.”
For those who still want it boiled down to a number,  here are the numbers the National Sleep Foundation updated in 2015: link: https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/national-sleep-foundation-recommends-new-sleep-times
