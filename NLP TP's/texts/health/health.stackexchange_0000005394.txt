How many Calories Deficit Equals 1 KG Lost?
I intend to loose weight and burn 500 calories daily in Gym. How many Calories Deficit Equals 1 KG Weight Loss, approximately?

A:

Burning 3,500 calories equals 1 pound of weight loss. To lose 1 kilogram of body weight, you would need to create a deficit of about 7,700 calories.
As stated above, 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound (0.45 kilogram) of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose 1 pound.
So, in general, if you cut 500 calories from your typical diet each day, you'd lose about 1 pound a week (500 calories x 7 days = 3,500 calories).
Calories burned during exercise is affected by body weight, intensity of workout, conditioning level and metabolism.
