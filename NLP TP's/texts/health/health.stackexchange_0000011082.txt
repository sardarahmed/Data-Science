Q:

Can someone get addicted to codeine by taking a few tablets in a month?

I've been having a migraine for a long time, tried different medications, different doctors. recently (for a few months) i noticed that the only medicine that really works for me when i have an attack is codeine. I take a codeine tablet when i have an attack, or 2 when the pain is really excruciating. 
My question is, is it possible to get addicted to this drug by taking about 4 tablets each month? The tablet is made of 300mg acetaminophen and 20mg codeine phosphate.

A:

Addiction occurs due to chronic or frequent use, which means a lot more often than you're taking it. Since you're going weeks between doses, and you're taking very small doses, there's no danger of you developing a dependence because of the gaps between doses. Your body simply isn't getting it often enough to develop a physical dependence. The danger would come from using it daily or abusing it for recreational purposes. Don't do that and you should be fine.
I've tried to find sources to support the above, but it's actually very difficult to find hard numbers. Nobody wants to put their finger on an amount that leads to addiction since it's going to vary from person to person, but the examples of addiction you can find will always involve daily or near daily use. Infrequent use as you're doing is never how addictions begin as long as they stay infrequent.
