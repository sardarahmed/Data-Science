Q:

Is Myocarditis infectious?

How can Myocarditis spread from a person who has it?
Is touching a person who died of Myocarditis dangerous?

A:

Myocarditis itself is not a virus nor is it contagious - the term refers an inflammation of the myocardium (a.k.a. the heart muscle). A viral infection is probably the most common cause of myocarditis but there's many different viruses that can have it as a complication including:

Adenovirus (the common cold)
Hepatitis B/C
Parvovirus
HIV
Rubella

the list goes on. It can also result from a bacterial infection (staph, strep, diptheria etc) parasites, fungal infections, or as a reaction to an environmental factors such as a drugs, medication, carbon monoxide, radiation.
So Myocarditis itself isn't transmissible but the some of the conditions that cause it might be - so any precautions required to prevent catching the contagion that caused the myocarditis apply. That said it's quite a rare complication and not always serious - and there's no saying that because one person developed it as a result of a given disease that anyone they infect will get it as well.
