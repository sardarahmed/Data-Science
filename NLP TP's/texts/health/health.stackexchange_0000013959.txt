Q:

Chagas disease: transmission

I am reading about Chagas disease. It is not clear for me if the transmission from mother to child can be called vector transmission or not, because I read in wikipedia that:

In Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through an
  insect vector called a triatomine bug

So, main mode of transmission is through the vector but from mother to child is also a less common mode of transmission?
Any help?

A:

Mother-to-Child transmission is known as "vertical transmission". Vector transmission exclusively refers to an intermediate organism (often, but not always, an insect).
