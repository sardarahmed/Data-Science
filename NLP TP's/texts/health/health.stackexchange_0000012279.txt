Q:

Ways to reverse a cavity before it goes rotten?

I was at the dentist for a checkup today and I was asking about a small black bit in my back tooth. He said it will eventually become a cavity and need a filling but for now it's fine and depending on how I look after my teeth it could be ok for a while. 
I found this a very odd thing to hear. It makes very little sense to me that there is nothing that can be done now to mitigate the effects in the future. I don't want to pay another â‚¬50 for a second opinion, so I'm wondering if he was right. Is there nothing that can be done during the early stages of a cavity to prevent it needing a full on filling in the future?

A:

Mainly with fluoridated toothpaste and sugar restriction. See
