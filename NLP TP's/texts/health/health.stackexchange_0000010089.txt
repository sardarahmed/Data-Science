Q:

What are the differences between blackheads and whiteheads? Different oils? Or different outcome?

What are the differences between blackheads  and or whiteheads? Are different types of oils (sebaceous) involved? Or are they irritated by different things? Or does one become a pimple? And the other one is more of a blemish? 

A:

When things like dead skin or cosmetic build-up get into your pores and plug them up, and that pore is still producing its normal amount of sebum, that's when it becomes a whitehead or blackhead. Whiteheads lie below the surface of your skin and blackheads are at the surface.
Both blackheads and whiteheads, says Dr. Chwalek, occur "when a pore gets blocked with dead skin cells and oils." The difference is that in the case of whiteheads the pore remains closed; whereas with blackheads, the pore is stretched open.
