Q:

How far away from a highway should I live to avoid negative health effects?

Many articles on the internet claim that living near highways can be harmful to one's health. Here is an example:

https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/01/05/living-close-to-high-traffic-roads-raises-dementia-risk-study.html

All told, cursory internet research suggests that several studies have been done on the subject, and they have found that living near highways can increase the risk of the following health problems:

Dementia (as described in the above article)
Cardiovascular disease
Impaired lung function
Asthma (particularly in children)

The studies all suggest that these health problems are caused by air pollution, usually in the form of ultrafine airborne particulate.
Given that, what is a reasonable safe distance to live away from a highway in order to reduce or eliminate the above health risks?

A:

To answer this question you would need to find the source of the information.  I found the study mentioned in the article in the Toronto Star (Chen, et al. 2017); and while studying risks of dementia, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, with emphasis mine, they said:

In this population-based cohort study, we assembled two population-based cohorts including all adults aged 20–50 years (about 4·4 million; multiple sclerosis cohort) and all adults aged 55–85 years (about 2·2 million; dementia or Parkinson's disease cohort) who resided in Ontario, Canada on April 1, 2001. Eligible patients were free of these neurological diseases, Ontario residents for 5 years or longer, and Canadian-born.

Between 2001, and 2012, they identified 

243,611 incident cases of dementia,
31,577 cases of Parkinson's disease, and
9,247 cases of multiple sclerosis.

They provided adjusted hazard ratios in the study - a comparison of the effect of different variables on survival or other outcomes that develop over time (Dawson, 2008). See also https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hazard-ratio
The adjusted hazard ratio of incident dementia was

1·07 for people living less than 50 m from a major traffic road (95% CI 1·06–1·08),
1·04 (1·02–1·05) for 50–100 m,
1·02 (1·01–1·03) for 101–200 m, and
1·00 (0·99–1·01) for 201–300 m
versus further than 300 m (p for trend=0·0349).

No association was found with Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.

Based on the averages used in the study, statistically speaking you will need to be living at least 200 metres (just over 218.5 yards) away from any major road to be relatively free of risk.

A:

There are many factors to consider. The pollution level (and risk) depends on at least the following:

typical wind direction during rush hour
density of trees between you and the road
elevation difference between you and the road
presence of a noise wall between you and the road
level and type of traffic on the road

This page aggregated a large number of studies to try to answer this and settled on  greater than 300 meters. Based on the studies cited in it and everything I've seen, that seems reasonable.
