Is it common/more likely for hearing-impaired & deaf individuals to have social anxiety disorders & panic attacks?
As someone born hearing-impaired myself, I know that I am extremely shy and suffer from social anxiety disorders and I think panic attacks every now and then.
However, I am not sure if that is unique to me and my personal circumstances or if many hearing-impaired or deaf individuals suffer from this as well? Is it common for us to experience this? Why or why not?  Is it because we often struggle with communication? Are not used to crowds? 

A:

Davis et. al (2007) conducted a large survey of the UK population between the ages of 55-74. They reported that 12% of their participants had a hearing problem that causes moderate or severe worry, annoyance or upset and 14% had a substantial hearing loss. Unfortunately, the data are not reported in a way that allows for determining what percentage of people with substantial hearing impairment also have moderate or severe worry, annoyance or upset.
