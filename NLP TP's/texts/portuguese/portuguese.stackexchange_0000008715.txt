Q:

Are there commonly used shortened forms of "direita" and "esquerda"?

As I understand it, direita means "right" and esquerda means "left". My Capoeira teacher sprinkles those in to let us know which leg a kick is using, or which direction to dodge. While I definitely appreciate how distinct the words are from each other ("left" and "right" share enough that I'll occasionally mishear it in noisy circumstances), periodically we'll have a situation where he's calling out lefts and rights quickly enough that having three syllables for each word is a bit cumbersome (for example, say we're doing a punching combination that consists of a left hook, two right jabs, and a left uppercut, and he's calling out "Left, Right, Right, Left" to remind us which hand we're striking with).
My teacher is not Brazilian, and is unaware of any common shortened form, but I figured there has to have been at least one case where someone has had to shout the words in rapid succession and decided on shortened forms. The closest I've found takes it to two syllables, albeit at the cost of making them harder to tell apart, destra and sestra.

A:

Except for D and E, which are by no means standard abbreviations, but are sometimes used in the written language, there isn't any. Not even in the army did I hear a shortened form.
