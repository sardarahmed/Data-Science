Q:

Does "me venceu" mean "defeated me" or "saved me"?

This is Brazilian Portuguese, just for context.
In the popular Capoeira song, Paranauê, the second line is almost always "Capoeira me venceu, Paraná" (occasionally, this gets rendered as "Capoeira que venceu, Paraná", which definitely shifts the meaning). What seems to differ is whether people translate that as something like "Capoeira has defeated me" or "Capoeira saved me", with that difference seemingly varying whether the person believes the song is about talking about how Capoeira has taken over their life versus whether it's describing how Capoeira won a war in Paraguay.
One example of the latter can be seen here:

Vou dizer minha mulher, Paraná (I’m going to tell my wife)
Capoeira me venceu, Paraná (Capoeira saved me)

Is either translation correct?

Musical Addendum:
Here is one of the most famous songs about Capoeira, from the great composer Vinícius de Moraes. This is the chorus:
Capoeira me mandou
Dizer que já chegou
Chegou para lutar
Berimbau me confirmou
Vai ter briga de amor
Tristeza camará
That chorus personifies both Capoeira, the fight-dance and the instrument, the Amerindian berimbau.
And if you don't know the song Berimbau, here's the full Monty:
