Q:

Why in Brazilian Portuguese the "de" and "te" started sounding like /dzhi/ and /tzhi/?

From English and Portuguese consonant phonemes compared:

Whenever /t/ or /d/ occur before /i/, they become respectively /tshi/
  and /dzhi/, as in words like leite ['leytshi] and pode ['pódzhi].

I'm presuming these new (but relatively old) sounds were due to a mix of dialects that induced their creation in Brazil, i.e in Portugal "de" sounds like the but in Brazil it sounds like djee or even gee...
However "do" sounds the same in both countries (doo). I couldn't find why this change occurred though, any ideas?

N'As consoantes do Inglês e do Português:

Sempre que /t/ e /d/ ocorrem antes de /i/, transformam-se
  respectivamente em /tshi/ e /dzhi/, como nas palavras leite ['leytshi] e pode ['pódzhi].

Presumo que estes sons, na altura da sua criação, tenham sido influenciados por algum dialeto já existente no Brasil. Porém não encontrei referências, alguém sabe o porquê?

A:

In many Brazilian Portuguese accents, [e] is "reduced" to [ɪ] or [i] when unstressed. Since the articulation of [ɪ] is similar to of [j]¹ (the later being the "y" sound in "yes"), what once was pronounced as [te] or [de] could possibly have started to be pronounced as [tʲi] and [dʲi] and progressed to [tʃi] and [dʒi], as it is nowadays. This process is called palatalization.
I don't really know why all this happened, but I assume it is just the natural evolution of the language. As Marcelo Silva noted, though, this is commom for São Paulo accent and it is possible that it's been spread to other regions through the media.
It's interesting to note, however, that these phenomena don't always occur the way I described. For instance, in my accent (I'm from Paraná), the palatalization occurs, but the reduction is less common. Thus, I pronounce "noite" as ['noj.te], but "tia" as ['tʃi.a]. On the other hand, in some regions (Northeast, usually) there is a reduction, but not the palatalization (thus "noite" is rendered as ['noj.tɪ] and "tia" as ['ti.a]).
¹From Wikipedia:

The palatal approximant is the semivocalic equivalent of the close
  front unrounded vowel [i]. The two are almost identical featurally.
  They alternate with each other in certain languages, such as French,
  and in the diphthongs of some languages, ⟨j⟩ and ⟨i̯⟩ with the
  non-syllabic diacritic are used in different transcription systems to
  represent the same sound.

Como nativo, e não especialista na área, acredito que seja mais fácil, rápido, suave e fluído, a pronúncia desta forma. 
Imagino que seja parte do sotaque paulistano, dado que se observa isso de forma mais marcante por lá. E, considerando que as grandes emissoras de televisão e rádio favorecem o sotaque paulistano em detrimento de outros, não é de se espantar que tal fenômeno passe a ser observado em outras regiões, com cada vez mais frequência.
