Q:

Etymology of Portuguese numbers 10, 20, 30...?

I myself am a native Finnish speaker and the whole numbers 10, 20 and so on translate word for word as ten, two tens etc. Why in Portuguese are these said dez and vinte. The rest make sense to me as they are some form of the numbers three, four, five...

A:

Well, if you go far, far, far, back, according to Wiktionary, vinte ultimately comes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) dwi(h₁)dḱm̥ti, meaning ’two tens, two decades’; dwóh₁ was ’two’ (Wiktionary), and déḱm̥ ’ten’ (Wiktionary;  these were reconstructed by linguists, not attested words). These eventually became viginti, duo and decem in Latin, which became vinte,  dois and dez in Portuguese.
Of the similarity between PIE dwi(h₁)dḱm̥ti and dwóh₁ + déḱm̥ very little survived into Classical Latin: only the vi in viginti, pronounced as uí (listen in Wiktionary), was related to uo in duo; and viginti and decem (listen) were pronounce with hard [g] and [k], two very similar sounds (as in frango and franco), and were both heirs to the k in déḱm̥. But even that was lost in Portuguese vinte and dez.
