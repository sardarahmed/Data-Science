Q:

how to say cigarette colloquially in Portuguese

What is a colloquial/slang expression for a cigarette in Brazilian Portuguese?
I only know that the formal one is "cigarro m".
Thank you.

A:

"Cigarro" is both formal and colloquial.
Some slang words and phrases are:

"pito", "crivo", "de branco" ([dressed] in white) - any cigarette

"mata-rato" (rat poison), "estoura-peito" (breast burster) - cheap, strong, bad cigarette

"guimba", "bituca", "bagana", "ponta" - a cigarette butt (or a joint).

Edited - also, "as vinte" (the twenty) - a cigarette butt.
(Edited because a cigarette butt is not a joint.)
ETA. Those words and expression are slang. And a good rule of thumb for any non-native speaker of any language is, "do not use slang"; the context for its use is complex and it is easy to make a fool of oneself by trying to use slang in a foreign language - even if you are quite fluent in its standard version.

A:

"cigarro" is the most common way to refer to cigarettes in pt=BR, in both formal and informal environments.  There are several other names but none of them are widely used throughout the country.  Some are slang words restricted to a specific group, some are regional usage. The dictionaries mention quite a few of them but, to be honest, I never heard them.
p.s. I've heard, however, the words "guimba" (a joint) and "mata-rato" (very low-quality cigarette), as mentioned by Luis Henrique in his answer.
