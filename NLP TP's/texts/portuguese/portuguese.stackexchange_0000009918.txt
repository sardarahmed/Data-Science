What does "IVA Discriminado" mean on the car websites in Portugal?
I have tried to look for information on Google but I couldn't find it.

A:

IVA in English is VAT, value-added tax which is used in the EU and not in, for example, the States.
discriminar here means to state the amount of the VAT tax.

Obrigações do locador O locador (empresa que aluga o carro) é
responsável por incluir o valor do IVA no preço do aluguel e emitir
uma fatura com o valor discriminado. Além disso, ele é obrigado a
recolher o imposto e repassá-lo ao Estado.

From a car rental company in Portugal: Total Renting
Translation: Obligations of the lessor (the rental company): The rental company is responsible for including the VAT amount in the rental price and issuing an invoice with that amount listed. Also, the company is obligated to collect the tax and onpass it to the state [government in US lingo].
So, the rental company collects it from the customer then pays it to the state.
IVA discriminado: stated VAT amount
