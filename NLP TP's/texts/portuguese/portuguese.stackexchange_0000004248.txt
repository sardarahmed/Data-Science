Q:

How do I say have a good holiday?

"Holiday" as in break from school. Like half term. I don't want to accidentally say holiday as in to go somewhere else kind of holiday. . 
Tenha uma boa pausa? 
Tenha um bom feriado? 

A:

If you are referring to just one day (not weekend) "Feriado" will be appropriate. "Tenha um bom feriado"
If you are referring to a longer period (not weekend) "Férias" will be the best word to use. "Tenha umas boas férias"

A:

This question somewhat relates to a previously asked question.
In Portuguese the most common translation for holiday is "férias". It can also be "feriado", if you are referring to a specific holiday such as the Christmas holiday (feriado de Natal). Therefore you can not really use "feriado" here.
The most commonly used sentence should be

Tenha umas boas férias (Have a nice holiday)

This sentence does not imply that the person will travel.
However, like the question I mentioned states, there is a slight difference between saying

Vou sair de férias (I am going on vacation)

and

Vou ter férias (I am going to have holidays)
