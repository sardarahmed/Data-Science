Q:

Semantic difference between "com" and "na"

I found two examples:

Deu de cara com a parede

and

Deu de cara na parede ?

And was wondering if the literal difference is the same as in English i.e. hit your head with the wall v hit your head in the wall
And whether one is more natural to use than the other

A:

dar de cara na parede, ran into the wall as in collide with. Physically.
dar de cara com is not run into in the sense of collide with. It means to encounter, to come across. to unexpectedly see. To come face to face with someone or something.
