Q:

Are there abbreviations for the names of the days of the week?

My app has an issue where pt_PT abbreviated names for [days of the week] were the full name and not the customary first 3 letters.
So instead of "domingo", I expected to see "dom".
In reality it's "domingo".
Is it always the case in pt_PT? In all instances?

A:

Is it always the case in pt_PT? In all instances?

No. As the question itself states "[your] app has an issue" and one can find similar bug reports, e.g., here and here, which also list the expected results:

"Seg", "Ter", "Qua", "Qui", "Sex", Sáb", "Dom"

Lower case is also an option:

dom  seg  ter  qua  qui  sex  sáb

And other possibilities include:

a) Se, Te, Qa, Qi, Sx, Sa, Do.
b) 2ª, 3ª, 4ª, 5ª, 6ª, Sa, Do.

Though I should add that, while (b) is quite common, I've never seen (a) in use and I suggest avoiding it.
