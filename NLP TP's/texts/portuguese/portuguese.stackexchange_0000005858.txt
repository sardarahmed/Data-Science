Q:

How do you say "Hey!" in Portuguese? Like, "Hey! What are you doing?"

How do you get someone’s attention in Brazilian Portuguese, like "Hey! Listen to me!"

A:

Well, there are so many ways. Here are some:

[any vocative - often combined with some of the options below]:
   Você! / Rapaz! / Moça! / Senhor! / Garoto! / ...

Maybe the most common option.

Com licença!

It's a polite form, also check Com licença ou dá licença?.

Por favor!

Perhaps even more polite than "Com licença", but fitting only in situations such as asking for something or a question.

Ei!

Colloquial.

Ô! / Ou! [often followed by a vocative]

Also colloquial.

Psiu!

Even more colloquial than "Ei" and "Ô", it might be considered rude by some.
