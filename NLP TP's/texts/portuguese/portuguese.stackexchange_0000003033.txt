Q:

Simple language news site possibly with media

I am looking for some website where I can obtain Portuguese news - preferably in Portuguese of Portugal - in simple language. It could be just text, but if it had audio or video (podcast or vodcast) even better... Examples in simple German language are Nachrichten-Leicht and news provided by the northern TV/radio station NDR. 

A:

I don't know about "simple", but you can look at the Portuguese mass media. It has few colloquialisms and, in video clips, generally good diction, so in those respects it may easy to understand:

RTP, website of the public television. Some written news articles, huge amount of program archives. Also online streaming of their TV and radio channels.
TVI/Media Capital, similar content, from a private media company.
Newspapers: Público (old orthography...), Expresso, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Notícias, Correio da Manhã, O Observador, Sábado. They have video clips in some news articles as well.
