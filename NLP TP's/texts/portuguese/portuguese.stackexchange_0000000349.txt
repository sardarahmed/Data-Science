Q:

Names with "foreign" letters K, W & Y

(This question is primarily about Brazil.)
The "old" Brazilian alphabet (i.e. between the 1943 and 1990 spelling reforms) didn't contain the letters K, W, Y.
I've been told that (first) names containing these letters (like Wellington/Welinton, Newton, Sydney, Kennedy) used to indicate low social class. (Maybe, a bit like Severino is associated with being a farmer from the North East.)
How did last names of historical figures come to be used as first names in Brazil? Are these names still associated to names for people from a low social class?

A:

The names of historical figures used to trend mostly via TV news and Hollywood movies. Thus, because the TV was the main opinion maker, and the low social class were the targeted audience, it was from TV they took their kids names from. But don't think middle and upper class didn't do that too. They did.
Nowadays people still do that, but not only from foreign sources (Ex. From our TV Soap Operas). Fun fact: Some people mix the father's and mother's names to form their children name.
Upper classes usually had the costume of naming their offspring after their ancestors, or at least use a name from the Portuguese and Spanish heritage. Also, they had the means to access other medias from where to get name ideas like books, magazines, travelling, etc.
