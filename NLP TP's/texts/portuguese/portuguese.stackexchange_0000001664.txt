Q:

Sounds: Why 'e' in some words become 'a' (uh) or 'ê' (en)? Why not 'é' (eh)?

Can "Lenha" be pronounced as "lanha" or "lênha"? Why not "lénha"? More explicitly: Why the e sound in some words become an a (uh) sound or an ê (en) sound? Why not an é (eh) sound?
A few words where I believe this difference in pronunciation happens:

lenho
vermelho
sobrancelha
castanheiro
francelho
velenho
verdelha
soutenho
menhir ?

In banho, manha and rebanho, for example, I assume the a is never pronounced as ê, or am I wrong?
I assume that the difference between a and ê may reside in the proximity of -nho(a/e/i) or -lho(a/e/i) and perhaps in the standard pronunciation of Portuguese (which some may refer to the latter (ê) as the most proper pronunciation (from Coimbra?)).
Edit
Relating to this question (thanks Jacinto):
Quando é que "e" se pronuncia /ɐj/?
I'm adding a few more examples:

telha
coelho
fedelho
grelha
venha

Not having -lh(vowel) or -nh(vowel) and also possibly being pronounced differently according to the region:

ex-ministro
sexta
texto
êxtase
flecha

A:

My answer concerns ptBR only. 
In ptBR the "e" in these words is never pronounced as an "a" sound.  The "e" in  "grelha" and "flecha" is pronounced as an open "e" ("é").  The "e" in all other words is always pronounced "ê".  Of importance is the fact that about half of those words are rarely used in ptBR (lenho, francelho, velenho, verdelho, soutenho, menhir). 
Lenha is pronounced lênha. Why not "lénha" ?  Because that's the way it is pronounced. Simple as that. 
Edit - The "a" before "nh" is always pronounced as "ã"
