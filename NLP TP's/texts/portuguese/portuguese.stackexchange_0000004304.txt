Q:

Help translating hand written message into English―what does "beata" mean?

I am visiting Portugal and a note was posted on the door of the apartment I'm staying in. I'm having difficulty translating it, both because I don't know Portuguese and because it's in hand writing.
I believe it translates to something along the lines of: "Please don't drop something on my terrace"? But I'm not sure. I have no idea what that 5th word is.
Also I have been very quiet and respectful of my neighbours so I'm not sure what they would be referring to. Though, yesterday the apartment above me was making lots of noise (I think they had children visiting), which might have been the cause?

Thank you kindly for your assistance.

A:

Your're quite right. The sentence reads:

Por favor não deitem beatas para o meu terraço.

The word you missed is beatas (plural), or singular, beata, which in Portugal, and in this case, means ‘cigarrete butt’, so:

Please don't drop cigarrete butts on my terrace.

Beata has other meanings―‘beatified woman’ (poorly known, in Portugal at least), or (very well known and derogatory) ‘excessively or outwardly pious woman’―but I’m pretty sure they did not mean that.
