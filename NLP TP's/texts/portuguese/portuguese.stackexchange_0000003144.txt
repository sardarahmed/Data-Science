Q:

«Bless you» in Brazilian

There is a special form (like a slang word) in brazilian for bless you.
It sounds like "sanutsch". But I can't remember.
Anyone know what I mean?

A:

We use |Saúde| wich is the same as health, to wish someone health.
Pronounce is |Saúdji| or saúdi. and SAÚDE is how you write it
