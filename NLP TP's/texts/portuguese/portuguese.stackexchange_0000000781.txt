Q:

What is the name of the skin part between nose and lip in portuguese?

I'd like to know what is the name of the part of body between the nose and lip in portuguese.

I guess that exists some scientific term that I can find in google, but I'm looking for the popular name.
Here is a similar question in English SE where i get the image.

A:

From the translation of philtrum, the English word for the area between the nose and upper lip, I discovered it is called Filtro Labial in Portuguese.
A quick search about this term showed a few results like this one in Wikipedia or this one (about bizarre names for human body parts), but those 2 links are not authoritative resources on anatomy I'm not an expert, so I'm not sure where to look for an official name.

A:

One could use "buço", by extension. 

Definition: the hair above the upper lip in men and some women.
