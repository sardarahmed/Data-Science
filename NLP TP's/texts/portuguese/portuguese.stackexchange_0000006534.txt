Q:

Domingo vs Domingão

My impression is that “Domingo” is the standard word for “Sunday”, a day of the week. However, I have also seen “Domingão” being used to mean “Sunday”. 
When I put both words through Google Translate, both are translated into English as “Sunday”, but when I translate “Sunday” into Portuguese, only “Domingo” is given. 
What is the difference between the two words? Is “Domingão” just a more obscure spelling of “Domingo”, or is it more of a regional term?

A:

"Domingo" means "Sunday". The suffix "ão" is an augmentative, so "domingão" literally means "big Sunday".
Calling something "big" may have different meanings, depending on the context. In this case probably the most relevant connotation is that of importance or affection, Sunday being a day often associated with fun and/or rest (BBQ, soccer, chilling, etc.) - the same way adding the "ão" to a person's name might be simply affectionate, unrelated to their size (e.g., "Vem aqui, Marcão." = "Come here, Marco my buddy.").
