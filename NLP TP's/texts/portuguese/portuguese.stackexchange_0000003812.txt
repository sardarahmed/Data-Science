What would you call "shower box" in Portuguese?

What would you call "shower box" in Portuguese?

A friend told me that they just use "box". That seems colloquial to me. Is there a formal expression for that?

A:

Yes, as mentioned by @Lambie, your link shows the picture of a "shower stall" or "shower cubicle" which translates as "box" in Portuguese.  We don't say "o box do chuveiro", it's simply "o box".

Achei o box do banho/banheiro muito pequeno.
