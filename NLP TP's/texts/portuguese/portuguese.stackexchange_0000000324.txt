Is there a similar expression in Portuguese?

A:

In European Portuguese the expressions "é/foi canja [de galinha]" ("it was canja") or "sem espinhas" ("without fish-bones") are used to indicate that a task was exceedingly easy to perform.
The first of these makes reference of this soup, which has a pretty straightforward recipe; whereas the second one relates to the fact that eating a fish with no bones is a much easier task than eating one with bones. 

O jogo foi/era canja. Acabei-o em duas horas.
  Acabei os trabalhos-de-casa em dez minutos. Sem espinhas.

There are many idioms capable of expressing how easy a task is, and different countries and regions will most likely tend to different idioms.
To name a few in European Portuguese:

"canja" (translates to a broth/soup with small pieces of chicken, pasta and/or rice, which is very easy to eat) : "Este jogo é canja, ganhei em 3 minutos."
"com uma perna às costas" (with one leg behind your back ; again, not to be taken literally) : "Ganho este jogo com uma perna às costas."
