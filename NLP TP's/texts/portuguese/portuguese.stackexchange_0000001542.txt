Q:

Brazilian or Portuguese dictionary?

I've recently started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and thought I might learn some basic Brazilian as well, given the opportunity to practice with assorted Native speakers. 
In getting a proper dictionary, should I definitely aim for a specific Brazilian one, or would most Portuguese dictionaries be just fine? 
Also, would be great if anyone could recommend a proper English<->Brazilian (or German or Danish) dictionary iOS App (preferably offline - I find mostly 'translator'-apps, phrasebooks, courses, learning games etc) 

A:

The language is still called "Portuguese"; the Brazilian dialect is just the most spoken.
I suggest buying a Portuguese dictionary published in Brazil (instead of one published in Portugal). The most famous ones are Houaiss and Aur√©lio. Lexikon publishes a number of reference books in Portuguese, like a thesaurus and a dictionary of common expressions. A grammar book could help some.
About translators, I use (rarely) Google Translator when on-line; you could use a pocket English-Portuguese dictionary (a paper one - I don't know if there any in e-book format).
