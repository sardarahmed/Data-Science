Q:

What does "disponha" mean?

I've heard this word used in response to expressions of gratitude - a type of You're welcome, so to speak. So here comes the questions:

What does it really mean?
What type of word is it? A verb? Noun?
Where did it originate? (i.e. why do people use it)

A:

What does it really mean?
It's a synonym of "you're welcome", in English.
What type of word is it? A verb? Noun?
It's a verb. In this case, at the 3rd person singular of subjunctive present, imperative form. 
Where did it originate? (i.e. why do people use it)
It's a contraction of the phrase "disponha de minha ajuda sempre que desejar" (You can count on my help whenever you want).

I'm Brazilian and see all answers here as correct.
But, although the word 'disponha' has, indeed, many meanings, it's far more used as a reply to a 'Thanks' sentence and the meaning of it in this context is exactly this:
It is a contraction of 'disponha de minha ajuda sempre que precisar' (You can count on me whenever you need) as this answer points out.
The word 'disponha' on this sentence can be exchanged by 'Fa√ßa uso de minha ajuda sempre que precisar' (something like, 'Make use of my help whenever you need'), but we never say it in any long form, it is always (and only) disponha.
