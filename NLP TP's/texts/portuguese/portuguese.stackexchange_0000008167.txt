Q:

Is it ok to just say 'Sem'?

So I'm working on some app development and using Portuguese as a target language. I have a section of the app that allows the user to change some settings. One of the settings is a timer. Previously I have had it say 'Sem relógio'. But for cutting down on space, I want to just have it say 'Sem'. Is this acceptable in Portuguese and does it make sense to native speakers?

A:

This is to make the layout clear:
MANTEIGA [BUTTER]

Sem [without]
Com [with]

BETTER:
MANTEIGA

Sim
Não

Unless the subject matter is on the screen, just using sem makes zero sense. In any case, you are better off with Yes/No.
Even in English, we would not say:
Timer

With
Without

We'd use TIMER, YES or NO, for example.
