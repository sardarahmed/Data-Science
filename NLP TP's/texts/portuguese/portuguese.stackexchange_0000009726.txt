Q:

How to translate "as long as you" (time comparison)

I am trying to find a Brazilian portuguese translation for the phrase "I have been doing this for as long as you" or "I have been here as long as you have been here."
Is there an idiomatic way to translate "as long as you" in this specific context?
Note: I am not looking for the translation in the sense of requirement, e.g. "You can come as long as you bring the snacks". Just in terms of time comparison.

A:

In pt-BR the most common translation for "I have been doing this for as long as you" would be:

Eu faço isso há tanto tempo quanto você.

And, for "I have been here as long as you have been here.":

Eu estou aqui há tanto tempo quanto você (está).

Alternatives to "há tanto tempo quanto você" include:

Faz tanto tempo quanto você.
Por tanto tempo quanto você.
Pelo mesmo tempo que você.
