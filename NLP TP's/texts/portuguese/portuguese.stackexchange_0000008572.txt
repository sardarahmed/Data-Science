Q:

What does “fechados com Bolsonaro” mean?

I see this used by supporters of President Bolsonaro, e.g. on Twitter as #fechadoscombolsonaro.
I know fechado means closed - is this some kind of pun on the idea of places being closed due to Covid-19 lockdowns?
Does fechados have a sense meaning “to be close [to someone’s way of thinking]”. The way I see it used is almost like “I stand with Bolsonaro”. I have not found any dictionary listing this sense but that’s my impression of how it is being used.

A:

"Estou fechado com Bolsonaro e não abro."
You're right, it's not to be taken literally. "Estou fechado" is a slang phrase for "I totally agree with", "I'm committed to", or "I'm wholeheartedly dedicated to".
It's often followed by "e não abro", also a slang phrase meaning "and I won't change my mind", "I won't rethink", "won't reassess".
"ok, estamos fechados" = "ok, agreed."
