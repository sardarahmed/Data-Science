Q:

Equivalent expression for "tl;dr" in Portuguese?

In English (Internet) tl;dr is an abbreviation for Too long; didn't read, used to indicate that what follows is either a summary of the overly long text.
Does there exist any equivalent expression in Portuguese (Europe/Brazilian)?

No Inglês (Internet) tl; dr é uma abreviatura para Too long; didn't read, que deve significar algo como Muito longo, não li. É usado para indicar um resumo do texto excessivamente longo.
Existe alguma expressão equivalente em Portugues (Europeu/Brasileiro)?

A:

There is no equivalent expression to tl;dr in Portuguese, as far as I know, but there are some expressions with similar meaning:
Curto e grosso - literal translation "Short and thick". What follows should be a direct explanation, no frills, possibly for thick-minded people.
Longo demais - "Too long". Just a complaint.
Em resumo: - "To summarize:" or "Summing up". What follows should be a summary of what was said before.
Resumo da ópera. Rarely used (who knows opera nowadays?). Used to cut a longer explanation and just tell the gist of the rest after it.

A:

You could use "resumindo" that is like in a nutshell, it says you are summarizing something. Thats the only expression that can be closer to tl;tr
