Q:

What does "CONCOC" stand for?

I wanted to check if "Concoc" was already a word or a brand name for anything, and it seems it is used in Brazillian videos, but I can't find it in a Portuguese dictionary.
Does CONCOC mean anything?
I don't speak any Portuguese so I can't deduce the meaning from context.

A:

CONCOC refers to the COC teaching system, originally Brazilian but bought by Pearson and CON is concurso, a competitive exam. So, the COC schools have competitive exams (concursos) to give scholarships to kids at various levels of education. So, CONCOC means: a competitive exam given by a COC school for purposes of bestowing scholarships.
Isso é o que quer dizer.

A:

Concoc is a brand in Brazil. They are schools around the country. Usually, they give scholarship, so, these videos are tips to the test for scholarship.
Here part of a news about it:

O aulão CONCOC ocorre no Cinesystem do Shopping Iguatemi, em
  Florianópolis, das 8h às 12h. Das  14h às 17h, do mesmo dia, será
  aplicada uma prova de conhecimentos gerais, na sede do COC, para os
  alunos concorrerem a bolsas de estudo na unidade. Todos os
  participantes da prova ganharão descontos na mensalidade do ensino
  médio.

In a quick and free translate:  A class preparation for scholarship happened.
