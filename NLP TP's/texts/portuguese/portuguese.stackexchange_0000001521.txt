Q:

"catch the bear before you sell its skin" How could we say this proverb in Portuguese?

I'm looking for a proverb in Portuguese that conveys the same.  I'm not looking for a translation or an explanation.  Literally, it means that the hunter who got paid for the bear's skin, and spent the money, and then couldn't catch any bear, found himself in a very awkward position. I'm looking for a similar proverb meaning that you have to follow a certain chronological order so as not to get in trouble. 

A:

In Portuguese, there is:

Não ponhas a carroça à frente dos bois.

which has an English analogue "(don't) put the cart before the horse", and whose meaning is the same.

A:

A good option to talk about someone in that sitution could be:

Não conte com o ovo no “fiofó”* da galinha.

*"fiofó" is a common substitute(slang) for coarse words that refers to butt
It can be translated to english as something like: "Do not count on the egg in the chicken's butt." and it's used when someone do something hastily.
See the examples below:

Maria nem recebeu a herança e está comprando uma casa. Está contando com o ovo no "fiofó" da galinha;

Não saia comprando tudo no mercado antes de receber o salário. Não conte com o ovo no “fiofó”* da galinha;

As suggested in the comments, another option to this could be:

Não conte com o ovo antes de a galinha pôr.

Avoiding any word that could be considered offensive.
