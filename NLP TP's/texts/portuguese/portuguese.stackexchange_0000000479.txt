Q:

What is an equivalent Portuguese expression for "to bite off more than one can chew"?

What is an equivalent Portuguese expression for "to bite off more than one can chew," that is, to take on a task that is too complex, costly, or lengthy to be completed? (reference)
Example: He bit off more than he could chew when he bought that 1880s-era house.
Is there a similar expression in Portuguese?

A:

I believe the nearest in meaning would be "dar o passo maior que a perna" (i.e. "try to jump more than your legs could").

A:

Based on this context:

I think I bit off more than I could chew when I agreed to paint
  this house by myself.

the Portuguese expression for this would be:

Ter mais olhos que barriga - Eu tive mais olhos que barriga quando aceitei pintar esta casa toda sozinho.

When a person accepts a lot of work and then can't handle it.
Another example - at the table when a person serves to much food and then can't eat it all.
Tem mais olhos que barriga
