Q:

What's the correct diminutive form of calça and camisa?

My understanding of diminutives is to "simply add a -inho(a) to any word to make it smaller or cuter" -- more or less.
My question resolves around two specific, every day words:
calça and camisa
Many times I have, out of (improper) habits, attempted to use the diminutive of these words, only to stop myself as I am well aware of their (at least in Brazil) meanings.
So, if the diminutive of calça is not calcinha, what is it?
If the diminutive of camisa is not camisinha, what is it?

A:

Well, these days the word "camisinha", as a popular synonym for "condom", has come to be used so often that some people just forget it can also mean "a small shirt". Whilst it may be ambiguous at times, context is everything. Most people prefer to avoid it altogether and say "uma camisa pequena", though.  There are times, however, when you have to use "camisinha" for a small shirt: "camisinha de pagão" is an example and there is no ambiguity. It's a small shirt for a newborn baby or an infant.  Then again, "calcinha" would never be used as a diminutive for "calças" (trousers) and it always means panties. I might refer to small trousers as "calças pequenas" or "calças curtas" if it were the case.
