Q:

What does "casos importados" mean in this context?

In Portugal, when the COVID-19 statistics is displayed on television, there is data titled "casos importados" - a list of countries followed by a number (not a big one, from 1 to about 20). What does this title supposed to mean? Is this a number of persons already having the virus (Portuguese or foreigners) who have entered Portugal from a respective country? Or is this a number of persons who then later have been diagnosed with COVID-19? Something else?

A:

Yes, it's the number of people who arrived from those countries already with the virus.
If they're known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 at arrival or if it's detected later on (say, while they're quarantined) doesn't play a role.
