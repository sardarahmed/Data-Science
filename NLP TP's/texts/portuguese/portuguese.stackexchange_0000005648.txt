Q:

What does it mean "Bater, bate o relógio mas só se tiver pilha"?

Google Translate successfully translated it to English. However I still don't understand the meaning of it (Crash, beats the clock but only if it has a stack). 
I thought it might be a famous saying but Google search results given me nothing useful. 

A:

I hadn't seen this expression before, but I'd translate it differently (check below for a better option), probably something like:

The clock does strike, but only when a battery is inserted.

Which seems to mean that

"It should work, but only if certain conditions are fulfilled."

But, in light of Jacinto's answer and as can be found, e.g., here, this sentence is more likely to be a whimsical reply, in which case a better translation would be:

To strike?! It is the clock that strikes, but only if it has a battery.
