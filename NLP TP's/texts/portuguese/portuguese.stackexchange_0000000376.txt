Q:

What does "rsrsrs" mean?

I often see rsrsrs in emails or on the internet. From context, I'm guessing it should mean something like "lol", which is thought to be an acronym of "laughing out loud". But I'm not sure whether rs is an acronym or an abbreviation (maybe of some form of the verb rir), or simply intended to represent the sound of someone laughing or something else entirely.
So, what's the meaning and origin of rsrsrs?

A:

The "rs" commonly seen in conversations throughout the internet, is an abbreviation of "risos" (laughs).
Depending on how a person pronounces it, it can also sound like a laughing (quite weird, but sounds like one...). Just like "kkkk", "hahaha", and so on.  
Just note however that "rsrs" isn't used in Portugal. There, the most common internet laughings are "hahaha" and the recent "kkkk".
