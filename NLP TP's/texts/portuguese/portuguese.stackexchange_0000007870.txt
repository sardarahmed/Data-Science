Q:

How to translate "ripple move" into Portuguese?

Ripple move: Oftentimes during editing, you need to move all the clips on a track at once. A quick way to do this is to use a ripple move. Hold shift, then click and drag a clip on the timeline. 
Another example: You can also use ripple move to move multiple clips at the same time to any specific place in the timeline.
For reference, please see this tutorial on using ripple move.
I've been thinking and would consider:
"movimento em ondulação?"

A:

In electronics we have the Ripple Voltage, that is translated as "Ondulação residual" in portuguese, although it's more common to use the untranslated name. Based on that, and that the most common translation for 'ripple' is indeed 'ondulação', I assume that there's no literal translations for "ripple" in portuguese, but approximations. My guess then would be that your translation is good enough, but it would make more sense as "movimento em ondulação".

A:

Another possible direct translation for "ripple move" is

movimento ondulado,

which happens to also be Google translator's suggestion.
But Adobe Premiere Pro's User Guide in Portuguese (Guia do Usuário) refers to

Edição de ondulação

which suggests

movimento de ondulação

as possibly closer to being an established expression for "ripple move".
