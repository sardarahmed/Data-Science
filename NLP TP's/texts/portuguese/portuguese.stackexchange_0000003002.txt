Q:

Is there any Portuguese word for "crowdsourcing"?

I'd like to know if any word or expression that represents the word "crowdsourcing" exists in Portuguese.
The definition, according to Wikipedia is:

A modern business term coined in 2006, is defined by Merriam-Webster
  as the process of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by
  soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially
  from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or
  suppliers.

Thinking about the similar word crowdfunding that is translated as "finaciamento coletivo", the best option that I can think for crowdsourcing is "terceirização coletiva", but this is strange, and I don't see it being used anywhere.
I know that this word is new (Wikipedia links its creation to 2006) and nowadays "crowdsourcing" is commonly used in Portuguese texts, but the concept is relatively old, so what was this business model called in Portuguese before?

A:

Não devemos ter medo de fazer uso de expressões que sempre existiram em Português e que se adequam perfeitamente ao conceito que se visa definir

the process of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers
