Q:

Is "iria" shortened to "ia" in spoken Brazilian Portuguese as a matter of course, or only when used as an auxiliary verb?

I'm pretty sure that the use of the spoken "ia" only coincides with the construction "Eu ia fazer alguma coisa, mas enfim não fiz", i.e. when it's used as a modifying auxiliary verb.
When iria is used as a standalone conjugation of the verb ir, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't shortern it, but I'm not 100% sure.
For example, in the following sentence, it would seem strange to me to shortern "iria" to "ia"

Se eu tivesse carro, eu iria pra praia amanhã 

Whereas in the following sentence, it seems more natural to me:

Eu ia dirigir pra praia, mas o carro tava quebrado então enfim eu tinha que pegar o busão, e claro que demorou pra caramba e enfim passei metade do dia esperando para os ônibus. Nossa essa empresa de ônibus é uma merda.

Is my intuition correct, that ia is used exclusively for when iria is used as an auxiliary verb, or am I wrong here? Answers in Portuguese are welcome, I've just asked in English because it takes me longer to write a question in Portuguese and I'm in a hurry.

A:

As pointed out by Centaurus here https://portuguese.stackexchange.com/a/4903/229, ia in the case of Eu ia fazer alguma coisa mas enfim não fiz is actually not short for iria, it's a completely different conjugation, the pretérito imperfeito do indicativo (or imperfect past).
It's for this reason it "seemed" more natural to use ia than iria  in the context of "I was going to do X"; because it's a completely different grammatical construction altogether, and not an abbreviation of iria.
