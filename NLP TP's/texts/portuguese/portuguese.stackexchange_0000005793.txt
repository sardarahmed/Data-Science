Q:

Baïla vs. Baila

Following the question «Conmigo vs. Comigo», I paid attention that in Portuguese Wiki, in the article «Baila Baila Comigo», the name of the song «Baila, baila comigo» by the Dominó band is written in a bit different way —  with diaeresis / diacritic / tréma / umlaut — «Baïla Baïla Comigo», is there any difference between Baila and Baïla? When should I use the first one and when the latter one?

A:

It's probably only playing with the French ï, the same way it's mixing some Portuguese and Spanish ("la dança") in the same cover (from the wikipedia link):

Capa do single francês intitulado "Baïla Baïla Comigo: La Dança do Nombril".

For, as already pointed out, there isn't any ï in Portuguese.
