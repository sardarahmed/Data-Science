Q:

What does «acerto electrónico de chaves» mean?

I find acerto meaning hit, but in this case does acerto mean to get a copy of keys, reprogramming keys, or anything else?

A:

Check meaning 4. from Aulete:

4. Mec. Regulagem de máquina, motor etc., para que funcione perfeitamente.

Acerto could indeed be a form of the verb acertar (indicative, present, first person, singular), but not here. In that case, it would be pronounced with an open e, rather than the closed one of the noun acerto.
