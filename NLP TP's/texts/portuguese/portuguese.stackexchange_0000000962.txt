Q:

Verbs ending in "sar" and "zar": is there any rule about the use "s" or "z"?

To be honest, primary school was long ago and I can't remember if I was taught any rule. I know when to use "s" or "z" from everyday usage, I presume. 

we use an "s" in such verbs as atrasar, alisar, analisar, avisar, pesquisar, paralisar, arrasar, extravasar, frisar, etc.
and a "z" is used in agonizar, amenizar, batizar, concretizar, simpatizar, utilizar, realizar, civilizar, etc. 

For those who are learning Portuguese as a foreign language, this must be a hard nut to crack.  Is there any rule to make things easier for the student?

A:

Verbs that end in -sar are derived from nouns whose last syllable has already an "s", if that syllable is preserved in the transition to the verbal variation. Otherwise, the -zar form will be used.
The examples you mention are quite illustrative:
atrasar/atraso, alisar/(a)liso, analisar/análise, avisar/aviso, pesquisar/pesquisa, paralisar/parálise(paralisia), arrasar/(ar)raso, extravasar/(extra)vaso, frisar/friso.
agonizar/agonia, amenizar/ameno, batizar/batismo, concretizar/concreto, simpatizar/simpatia, utilizar/útil, realizar/real, civilizar/civil.
