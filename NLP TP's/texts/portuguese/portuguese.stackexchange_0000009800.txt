Q:

What is an "indostânico"?

In recent months, while reading Portuguese news articles, I have noticed the increasing popularity of the term "indostânico". What is the definition of "indostânico"? Has there been convergence towards a single definition?
Some use "indostânico" to refer to South Asian peoples, i.e., Subcontinentals. For example, from a not-too-recent article,

[...] mercearias e frutarias propriedade de cidadãos oriundos da Península Indostânica, ou seja, de países como a Índia, o Paquistão e o Bangladesh

Is this the only definition?

A:

Priberam's Portuguese dictionary gives two, related, definitions:

Related to Indostão (Hindustan), part of the Indian subcontinent which includes parts of India and Pakistan;
Related to Hindustani, an Indo-European language which enjoys wide diffusion in India.

It also records the variant industânico.
So it may refer either to something from that part of the Indian subcontinent, or to the language (which is generally called Hindi in India and Urdu in Pakistan).
