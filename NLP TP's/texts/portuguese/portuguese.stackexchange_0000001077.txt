Q:

Como traduzir para InglÃªs "que eu aconselho"?

There is also an audio sample, [que eu aconselho].

How could I best complete this sentence?
Alternatively, how could I re-structure it to communicate what I mean?

I found this alternative, but it does not feel like proper English ("shoot the innacurate").

(...) which I suggest you listen to.

A:

The alternative you found is okay:

There is also an audio sample, which I suggest you listen to.

This sounds a bit formal, however, and depending on tone, it can sound a bit pushy.  Some other options include:

There is also an audio sample, which I recommend.
  There is also an audio sample, which I hope you'll listen to.

Or, recasting the sentence:

I recommend the audio sample.
  I hope you'll listen to the audio sample.

These last two sound the most natural to me on their own, but the others are perfectly valid options if you need to use them.
