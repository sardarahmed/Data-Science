Q:

Second given name vs. First surname

Let's say a person's name consists of 3 words (e.g., Jhonatan Christian Maraschin). Is the middle word (e.g., Christian) second given name (Jhonatan Christian // Maraschin) or first surname (Jhonatan // Christian Maraschin)? If it can be both, how can I tell? Or is it just a "middle name" like in English? 

A:

In Brazil it can be either.
It's not unusual for parents to chose only one surname for their child, usually the father's surname.  How can you tell, then, if a middle word is part of one's surname?  You can't, unless you know most given names and most surnames here. Even so, sometimes you'll find a surname that looks like a given name, and vice-versa.
Examples where the second name is likely to be part of the first name:

Maria da Luz Ferreira
Fernando Antonio da Silva Santos
José Antonio de Castro
Ana Carolina de Assis

Examples where the second name is likely to be a surname:

Roberto Soares de Souza
Alexandre Martins do Couto
Teresa Freitas da Silveira
Natália Siqueira Ribeiro

Given names that look like surnames:

Santiago Pereira de Santana
Miranda de Oliveira Guimarães
Valentim José de Almeida

Surnames that look like a first name:

Roberta Pedro Guimarães 
Antonio  Rosa da Silva
Renato da Conceição Menezes
Teresa de Fátima Gabriel

A:

It can be both. You generally can tell because most given names and surnames are distinct. Sometimes the two groups of names are separated by de or dos (though de can also be used to unite two words of a name consisting of several words, such as Maria da Piedade). In Portugal, by far the most common is to give babies two first names and two surnames, though it can be as low as one surname as high as four. Some people are also given only one first name. When there are two surnames, the last name is usually the father's. Upon marriage, many women — but not as many as in the past — append the husband's last surname, so they get three surnames.
