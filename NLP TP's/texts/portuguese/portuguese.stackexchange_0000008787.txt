Translation of "IOU"

I wish to know the Portuguese for "IOU". I.e. an informal note someone may write on a piece of paper to acknowledge that they owe someone something. It appears impossible to search for it in online dictionaries because IOU isn't a word and if I searched for "I owe you" I am concerned that the answer might not be the same thing.
I also want to be sure that it really means the same thing, so for example I don't want a technical term that only economists or bankers would use.

A:

An IOU is a word. It's on Wikipedia:
IOU
A palavra quer dizer e se traduz por (um) reconhecimento de dívida
Não há outra tradução.

O reconhecimento de dívida designa a declaração unilateral mediante a qual alguém reconhece uma dívida a outrem.

Lexionário
An IOU can be something official between companies, say, or just a paper I write and sign, saying I owe someone money. It is not a negotiable instruments. The negotiable debt instrument is called a promissory note, nota promissória.
