Q:

Vernacular differences between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro?

In the early 90s, I was dating a Paulista in Houston and I had a Portuguese tutor from Rio.  One day she put on a video of a comedy segment from Brazilian TV for a group of Brazilians.  Someone was having fun with the vernacular differences between Rio and São Paulo.  It was all over my head at the time (and still is!), but I remember they were all in stitches.  The only item I remember was that they say "upside down" or "stand on your head" differently, but I have no idea of the actual Portuguese.
Would anyone know this comedy segment, or another place I might learn more about these regional differences?  I figure it would be on YouTube by now, if I knew where to look.

A:

If you can understand spoken Portuguese, I suggest you to watch Portuguese With Leo on you YouTube, specifically videos where he talks to Brazilians like Márcia Macedo, who is Paulista.
I am from Belém do Pará and my accent is different from Paulista one and is a little bit similar to Carioca. For example in "xadrez" (chess), I pronounce "z" just like the "x", sounding like a "sh" in "smash" but a little bit longer.
Some paraenses say "eu tava em casa" (I was at home) pronuncing "v" just like the "j" in Spanish (for example, in Javier")
