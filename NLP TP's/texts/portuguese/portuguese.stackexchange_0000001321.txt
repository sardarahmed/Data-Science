Q:

Why in Brazil "nossa!" (our) is "wow!"?

I was wondering why in Brazilian Portuguese, the word "nossa" is used as an exclamatory remark similar to "wow".
I found that "nossa que legal!" may be interpreted as "wow, how cool!".
However, the literal meaning of "nossa" is our, which puzzled me further... So how did this expression came to be?

A:

"Nossa" (short for "Nossa Senhora" = Our Lady) is an exclamation expressing surprise or astonishment.  It's current usage in Brazil. Here are some examples with context where it is frequently used:
(a) "Aqui está a cerveja. Eu trouxe 40 latinhas." 
(b) "Nossa!  Não precisava tanto." 
(a) "Dê uma olhada lá fora. Devem ter caído uns 40 centímetros de neve."
(b) "Nossa!  Nunca vi tanta neve."
(a) husband - "Não gosto da tua mãe."
(b) wife - "Nossa! Não precisa ser grosseiro."
Similar interjections in English: "wow", "holy cow", "gosh" or even "Jesus."
In ptBR there are quite a few informal or slang words expressing the same as "nossa": "caramba", porra ¹, "Deus do céu", "minha nossa", "Nossa Senhora", etc.
¹ A four-letter word.

A:

I am not able to historically trace back the use of the term, so I will answer your "why" with an "intuitive common sense" or a "first step before further investigation". I am a native Brazilian.
As an interjection, "nossa" is a contraction of "Nossa Senhora" (Priberam dictionary, 2008-2013, accessed in 10-10-2015). In turn, "Nossa Senhora" ("Our Lady") is a contraction of some of the titles given to Maria (the "Blessed Virgin Mary"). There are different titles given to Maria (Mary) and their uses will vary with the location or origin:

Nossa Senhora de Nazaré (Belém, PA)
Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida (São Paulo, SP)

Nossa Senhora das Flores (Ilha das Flores, Sergipe, SE)

Nossa Senhora da Medalha Milagrosa (Miraculous Medal)

Nossa Senhora das Graças;

and so on...
