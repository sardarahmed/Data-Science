Q:

Que número tem o seu lugar?

I am new to Portugese, but have experience in learning foreign languages. I am looking at this dialogue (from Assimil):

Desculpe, que número tem o seu lugar?
O meu lugar é o número treze.

What pussles me is the use of verb tener/tem (=to have) in the first phrase. It seems to me that this phrase would be totally illegal in English or French, since the subject (o seu lugar, the possessor) and the object (número, the possessed) are swapped. (Such swap is permissible in German, provided that the relevant case endings appear.) On the other hand, swapping in the second sentence, using verb ser/é(=to be) would pose no problem in any of the languages mentioned.
Are we dealing here with an idiomatic use, specific to Portuguese? Or perhaps, this is an inversion, enabled by the preceding desculpe? Or is this simply an example of incorrect use, that might appear occasionally in elementary study aids?

A:

No, there's nothing wrong or really strange with it.
The word "que" ("that", "which", etc.) makes the question clear to a native:

que número tem o seu lugar?

does not mean "the number has your seat", but (as Lambie pointed out in the comments)

which number does your seat have?
