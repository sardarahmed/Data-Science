Q:

Nós estamos - how to pronounce the "s"

So in European Portuguese the "s" is pronounced like a Z if it's between two vowels. But also in estamos the e sound isn't pronounced, so it sounds more like shtamos.
So when pronouncing Nós estamos, is it pronounced like

Nosh shtamos
Noz eshtamos
Noz shtamos

A:

It's not necessarily true that "the e sound isn't pronounced". It depends on factors such as the speed of speech and formality. It can be pronounced but reduced to /i/ or /ɨ/, in which case a speaker might say /nɔ.ziʃ.tɐ.muʃ/, if speaking slowly and formally, for example.
Otherwise, a speaker would say /nɔʃ.tɐ.muʃ/. If there's a pause between nós and estamos, which there usually wouldn't be, then it'd be /nɔʃ.ʃtɐ.muʃ/.
/s‿ʃ/ is possible, but less frequent, so /nɔs‿ʃtɐ.muʃ/ is possible too. The issue you're concerned about is technically called "consonant sandhi", and there's a brief summary of how it works on Wikipedia.
