Q:

Meaning and use cases of "já já" in spoken Brazilian Portuguese

Could someone explain to me the meanings and use cases of "já já"?

A:

It really depends on the context. For an example, if you are waiting for your dish and the waitress says "vem já já", it's like a friendly way of saying that it will be here soon, but that she doesn't know the exact time.  Another example: "Ele está chegando já já" means that he is arriving soon, at any moment. The word já used by itself can be used in a more formal way, like in an order: "vem cá já!", said to a kid, means that he should get going RIGHT NOW :)

A:

Já - dá a ideia de imediatamente, agora ou "neste instante".
Exemplo: Já vou!
Já, já - dá a ideia de "daqui a pouco" ou  "aguarde só um momento"...
Exemplo: Espera que já já eu vou.

Já - it gives the idea immediately , at the moment , right now.
Já, já - it gives the idea of ​​"a little later" or "wait just a moment".
