Q:

How to translate "payment gateway" into Brazilian Portuguese?

I've been pulling my hairs on this one. Here is an example to contextualize its usage:

You have shipping and/or tax enabled on your payment gateway which makes "Show Total Price" enabled by default.

Other examples:

Would you like to keep the products to be used with another payment gateway?
Only after we receive a notification from the payment gateway.
Setup your payment gateway and products.

A:

I've seen people use "plataforma(s) de pagamento"

Examples of some well-known payment gateways in Brazil
1 - PayPal
2 – MoIP
3 – PagSeguro
4 – MercadoPago
5 – Cielo
