Q:

Is there a translation of "troll"?

(Computer Science) computing a person who submits deliberately inflammatory articles to an internet discussion

Is there a Portuguese translation for this meaning of troll?
I was surprised to find a literal translation in the dictionary, trol:

Indivíduo que coloca mensagens ou comentários provocadores em sítios de discussão pública on-line, com intuito desestabilizador.

However, I haven't seen this word being used in Portuguese before (besides from translation websites, Google is not providing examples in Portuguese). Wikipedia seems to register it as troll and the single l'ed trol was a toy factory in Brazil. 
Therefore, how do people refer to an "online" troll in Portuguese?

A:

The word troll is used without being translated.
But I have seen very often people using the term trolador, which means the same as troll.
Also, people use the verb trollar, and sometimes trolar, which means make fun of someone (as you may see in Wiktionary).

A:

As a brazilian, I also said "troll" sometimes talking with other person even in Portuguese. There are other words we don't translate, for example, bullying (meaning the coward acts often seen in schools towards other students intended to humiliate them...). Some terms related with technology, are used in english, like trolls, I've also heard the word haters (when someone in internet has the only purpose to be agressive, gor example in comments...) The word mouse (the computer mouse) is also not translated.

A:

Existe uma gíria em pt-BR para uma pessoa com esse tipo de comportamento: "zueiro" ou "zoeiro". Você também poderá encontrar muitas vezes a palavra em forma de verbo também: "zoar"
Exemplo:

"João zoou muito ao comentar em um site de culinária. João é zoeiro."
"A zoeira não tem limites."
