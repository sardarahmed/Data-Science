Q:

What's the meaning of "Maçarico" in European Portuguese?

The word "Maçarico" refers to a tool that sets fire, used for many purposes. I did some research and discovered that it also refers to a specific type of bird.
However, when I was listening to the music "Numa Numa" by the band "Onda Choc" (portuguese version of the famous song dragostea din tei), I noticed that in the song the word "Maçarico" is used in another way:

Alô! Olá jóia! Sou eu de novo! O Picasso!  Mas não me faças num
  fanico. Eu não sou um maçarico!
Eu liguei, numa boa, hei! Numa boa, hei! Numa numa boa, hei! Eu cá
  estou, sem drama aguardarei. O amor vem mas também vai.

What's the meaning of the word "Maçarico" in this context?

A:

A maçarico in that context means a rookie, someone who is new to an activity and has very little experience.
The other meaning, the fire-spitting tool, is a blowtorch.
