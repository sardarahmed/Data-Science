Q:

What does, "entra logo para a escola...." mean?

Someone just sent me an email in which they said:

o João entra logo para a escola porque estás férias são muito curtas.

My Portuguese is rather limited, and I am not sure what entra logo para a escola means.
I though it might mean that he 'begins school soon, because his vacation is short', but that seems odd since with Christmas coming in a few days, I would think his school would just be ending, not beginning.
But perhaps she just wrote hastily and did not explain herself clearly.

Am I missing something?
Can anyone confirm that the quote really means, "Joao will soon begin school because his vacation is very short."?
Or if I am wrong, what does it mean?

A:

Yes, you read it correctly
You are interpreting it right.
In this context, "logo" seems to mean "right away".
João will rejoin school.
But because the holidays are very short, he will rejoin right away; quickly; soon.
João is already on holidays
According to the Education Ministry, the Christmas Holidays already started: they started on the 19th December, and last until the 2nd January.
João is already on holidays.
But why "logo"? Two weeks is not so short... maybe João would swap with me?
I only get 4 weeks for the whole year!
