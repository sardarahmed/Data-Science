Q:

What is the correct word for "background"?

In English, it's common to use the word 'background' to denote a previous knowledge or even a previous research, like in the examples:

I don't have background in botanics;
Theoretical background;
I have background in this field, so I know what I mean;

The translation for the word is "fundo", but is not the correct word to use in this cases like "Eu não tenho fundo(s) em botânica";
What is the correct word?

A:

The Portuguese word fundo in this context can only be used when referring to a "backdrop" or an extreme end of something, such as a scenery or the end of a hole. In the metaphorical sense, it can also be used to refer to the bottom of a subject ("o fundo do assunto").
On the other hand, fundamento is more appropriate for your situation. Although the primary meaning is "foundation", "motive" and "cause" (it literally translates to the English word foundation), it is often used in Portuguese when mentioning a scientific or technical background.

Não tenho fundamentos em botânica.

Another alternative is to rely on synonyms, such as "experience" or "education".

Não tenho experiência em botânica.
Não tenho formação em botânica.
