Q:

Is "farnizim" the same as saying "frenesi"?

These two words seem to have a similar meaning:

Farnizim (Dicionário Informal): agony, impatience.
Frenesi (Priberam): excitement caused by impatience.

Though the first one seems to be accepted in Brazil and have a broader meaning, it seems to have derived from the second one, frenesim or frenesi, that is more commonly used in European Portuguese.
I was wondering what city is SE (from the first link), if it identifies better the region where it is used.
So are they really the same? Are they both used in different regions of Brazil?

A:

farnizim sounds like a "provincial word" (north of Brazil). Frenesi word is used in Brazil as well (Very rarely I heard someone use the term farnizim).
Dialeto da costa norte (dialect of north coast)
The dialect of the north coast, sometimes also called dialeto cearense (Ceará dialect), being famously described as the main Ceará state dialect is a variant of the Brazilian Portuguese spoken in the state of Ceará and parts of Piauí and Maranhão. In Ceará, its root state, has approximately 8.5 million speakers.
It has internal variations, especially in the metropolitan area of Fortaleza, in Jaguaribana region, Grande Teresina and Maranhense east.
