Q:

Legendary forgotten Kingdom of Lechia

In the past I heard couple of legends about some mythic land in the north of Europe called Lechia. But after reading couple of articles about legendary Kingdom of Lechia I decided to find more information about this Kingdom. Below I listed some of them and I wonder, is it something real or should we think about it as a legend/mythology?
ANCIENT CITIES:

Kodan (nowadays polish city Gdańsk) – 1750 BC -> confirmed by Pomponius Mela’s

MEGALITHIC TOMBS:

ROMAN CONNECTION:

CERAMIC:

So my question is about existence of this kind of civilisation in the ancient time. Is it real or myth?

A:

Lechia is the mythological name for Poland, stemming from the word Lech (which is also a common first name). 

According to legend, the name derives from the first ruler of Poland, Lech. It is also the derivation for the term Lechitic languages.
