Q:

What is the meaning of this wooden symbol found in a basement?

I have no idea if this is the right place to ask this, but it felt like the best bet.  I discovered this crudely carved wooden symbol/cross in a basement (see picture below).  Any idea what it might represent?
It doesn't seem to be any common Christian cross given the bent horn-like things on top.  I didn't find any other symbols or wooden bits nearby so I assume this is the whole thing.  It's possible it might be some tool or jig used in construction, but I can't imagine what purpose it could serve.
Thanks for your help, and let me know if there's any additional information I can add.

A:

Gothic Arch Window Frame

I suspect that the best bet for this bit of wood is that was once part of a completely unmythical window frame. This bit would have been in the middle, and there would have been a larger, exterior frame around it. There are loads of different styles, sizes, and levels of fanciness to these things. The image below is illustrative rather than diagnostic for a particular style or make.
