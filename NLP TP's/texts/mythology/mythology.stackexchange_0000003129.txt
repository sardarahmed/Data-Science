Q:

What/Which minor gods/spirits are associated with Dionysus?

I know of:

Gelos (divine personification of laughter) 
Comus (god of festivities, revels, and late-night hookups)  -
Agathodaemon (daemon of vinyards and grainfields). 

Are there any others?

A:

the Nysiads

These are they Nymphs of Nysa, who cared for the young Dionysus before his return to Greece. The god's childhood at Nysa is an important part of his cycle, not least because it is a reflection of Zeus' own infancy, hidden from Cronus on Mt. Ida and cared for by nymphs. 

the satyr Silenus 

was said to be his tutor at Nysa.  Like Chiron, Silenus is contradiction in that the races of the two (Centaurs and Satyrs, respectively) are wild and savage, while these named teachers are renowned for their wisdom.  Silenus is a good representation of the dual nature of Dionysus/wine--wine requires cultivation and craft to make, but it intoxicates and over-consumption can lead to irrationality and wild behavior (maenads).  This outlet of pent up energy in the Bacchic revels was understood to be beneficial. 

the great goddess Cybele

was said to have cured him of his madness, and taught him the mysteries. Cybele is often regarded as a goddess with a dual dark and light nature, and would have made a formidable (and prestigious) mentor.  Like Dionysus, she is associated with "wild music, wine, and a disorderly, ecstatic following."
