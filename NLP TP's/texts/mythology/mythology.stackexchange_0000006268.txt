Q:

How are Vetalas similar to Medusa?

According to Hindu Mythology, Vetalas are snake-like creatures. How are they similar to Medusa?

A:

I'm afraid the source you mentioned is on a TV show called Lost Girl.
The best source for finding relevant info on the Vetala is the Kathasaritsagara especially book 12
And especially the story (better known as Vikram and the Vampire) of Baital Pachisi   or Twenty-five (tales of a) Baital (In Sanskrit, Vetala-pancha-Vinshati. "Baital" is the modern form of Vetala)ยน

The twelfth book is important as it contains the plan and details of a collection of tales extremely popular in India, existing both in Sanskrit and in all the vernacular dialects, called the Vetala Panchavimshati: twenty-five tales of a Vetala being related by a sprite, who haunts cemeteries and animates dead bodies, to Vikramaditya, king of Ujjain, according to the usual version, to Trivikramasena, king of Pratishthan, on the Godavari, according to the Kathasaritsagara.Kathasaritsagara Wikipedia

Further information may be gleaned from the The Imperial Gazetteer of India Vol.2 a great historical reference book, which is available online for free and linked at the bottom of the quote.

A collection of pretty and ingenious fairy-tales is the
  Vetalapanchavimsati, or ' Twenty-five Tales of the Goblin,' stories
  supposed to be told to king Vikrama of Ujjayini by a demon inhabiting
  a corpse. They are known to English readers from Sir Richard Burton's
  Vikram and the Vampire. Another collection of fairy-tales is the
  Simhasana-dvatrimsika, or ' Thirtytwo Stories of the Lion-seat,'
  supposed to be told to king Vikrama by his throne. Both these works
  are of Buddhistic origin. To the same class belongs the Suka-saptati,
  or ' Seventy Stories of a Parrot,' represented as narrated to a wife
  whose husband is away on his travels. The Imperial Gazetteer of
