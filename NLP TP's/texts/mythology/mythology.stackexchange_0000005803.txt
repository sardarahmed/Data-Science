Q:

Why mythical god-like figures share common attributes like wings or lion body parts in different mythologies/cultures

I know some of this mythological depictions are supposed to represent many things like nature forces, and I know Jung's Archetypes theory about symbols founded on the unconscious mind. However I want to know if there is any interpretation or theory on why all these gods had wings and in some cases body parts from animals like horses or lions.

A:

A recent study in psychology found considerable evidence suggesting that applying human-like traits to non-human entities, like animals, shapes, and supernatural beings, may constitute an innate cognitive bias, a bias that is common among all human minds. This behavior is therefore not considered to be primarily dependent on culture (and consequentially the need for similarities in cultures).
