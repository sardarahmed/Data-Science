Q:

Why did Li Po carry a sword?

I use the archaic translation of his name, now preferred as Li Bai  李白.  Although a historical figure, Chinese history and mythology are considered to have been comingled prior to modern scholarship.  (Think founding myths of nations.)

Why was Li Bai said to carry a jian?

Is there a tradition of warrior poets in Chinese myth and history?

A:

Yes, there is an Asian tradition of warrior poets, but the historical Li Bai is not one of them. The myth of Li Bai the wandering swordsman is a fairly recent invention. The strongest historical association with swords comes from the Tang expression "The Three Wonders": Li Bai's poetry, Pei Min's swordplay, and Zhang Xu's calligraphy.
Li Bai was most likely born during the Wu Zhou interregnum of the Tang dynasty. The Tang dynasty's founders were the Li (李) family. His parents were not part of the imperial court, but they were prosperous merchants. Li Bai in several of his writings claimed to be related to the imperial Tang family.
Li Bai was almost certainly trained in swordmanship, as would be required of a son of a prosperous house. Legend says in 724 to continue his study of the sword, he received the Longquan sword from his father, left his relatives, and moved to Shandong to study under a famous master General.
What is certain is that Li Bai had a lifelong admiration for the warrior class. Many of his poems reflect this, especially the poem 俠客行 "Travels of a knight errant". It is likely from this poem that the later equation of Li Bai with an actual warrior-poet stems.
