Q:

How were eclipses explained in Egyptian mythology?

Eclipses were probably one of the phenomena that puzzled the ancient people. How was it explained in Egyptian mythology, and were there any gods connected with it (like thunder is connected to Zeus)?

A:

There is actually an Egyptian goddess named Hathor and he is the god of Solar Eclipses. From this website there are actually many gods associated with the sun:

Horus the Hawk is the Sun in totality.
The Sun god Atum is the eclipsed Sun passing the second contact of a
total eclipse.
Ra is the eclipsed Sun shining past the third contact as the Diamond
Ring (Sacred Geometry)
The Scarab Khepri was a representation of the dark New Moon.
The Great Sphinx was the Egyptian Lord of Solar Eclipses.
Hathor was the Egyptian Goddess of Solar Eclipses.

The problem is the Egyptians couldn't explain why the gods had this phenomenon and never actually put into words their beleif on the matter.
