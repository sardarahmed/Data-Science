Q:

When a person brings much good to people, but they reject it?

Is there an archetypal myth in which a person does something really good to humanity, but contrary to common sense that says that he should be thanked and praised, he's attacked by those whom he helped instead? There's a lot of situations like that, when people simply don't want something really good, because well they are people. Like Nietzsche and his Zarathustra, who came down to people and started talking to them but instead they were saying he's a fool. 

A:

The story of Jesus Christ. Came to save the world, but the same people killed him
