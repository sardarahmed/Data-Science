Q:

How powerful were Greek gods without their items?

Many magical items Greek gods have are very powerful. But sometimes they hand them out like its Christmas.
So how powerful are greek gods?
Could, for example, Zeus still control weather without his lightning bolts? Were the items just a weak reflection of god power and modern fantasy gives them too much power?

A:

The gods have powers of their own. As evidenced in the many hymns epics and poems.
Immortality
Transformation or shape shifting
Enhanced intelligence
The ability and powers to move from one place to another in an instant
Powers to manipulate animals to obey their commands
Powers to manipulate the weather
Powers to become invisible
Powers to create fantastic beings with supernatural powers
Their blood was a bright unearthly fluid called Ichor that had the power of producing new life
This is without their weapons .
So if you take away their weapons, they still have a lot of powers left.
