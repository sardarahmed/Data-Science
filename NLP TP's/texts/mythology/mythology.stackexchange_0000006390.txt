Q:

Was Ares a Hero or Villain?

I know Ares is the god of war and all, but in most stories I've read, he mostly acts more like a villain instead of a god. Why would anyone worship such a god? In stark contrast, Mars was widely worshipped.

A:

You can't categorize the Olympians with DC/Marvel labels. The Ancient Greeks didn't even think of their gods as we currently think of that concept. Greek gods were regarded much more like the deep, layered human characters of Bronte or Wolf. That's why virtually all Olympian myths are tragedies.

A:

Why would someone worship such a god?  So he didn't smite you for your insolence.  Who are you, a mere mortal, to presume to withhold due rites from a god?  Especially one whom you know is willing to do terrible things to you?
I will add that the Homeric Hymn to Ares shows a much more favorable view.  Also, you have such myths as that the Areopagus, which was said to be named from the way that the first trial there was Ares's for murder -- Poseidon prosecuted him for killing one of his sons -- and Ares was acquitted on the defense that the son had been trying rape his daughter at the time.
