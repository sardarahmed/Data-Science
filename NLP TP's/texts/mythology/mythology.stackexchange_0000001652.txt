Q:

Did Huginn and Muninn have personalities?

Odin was known for having two ravens with him, Huginn and Muninn.  They flew all of Midgard and collected stories that they told to Odin.
Since they are associated with 'thought' and 'memory,' I wonder if this was characterized in any way by them?  Did either have tendencies or other facets of their nature?

A:

Evidently they did have something to distinguish them, as Odin (while in disguise) said that he worries that Huginn won't come back, but he cares more for Muninn (Poetic Edda, Grímnismál).
Unfortunately, since they never say anything in what of the Norse myths are left, it's impossible to know their individual personalities.
