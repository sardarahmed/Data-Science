Q:

Image of God of Time

In the Time for Chronos, I wrote some code that uses the chrono library to measure the time needed for an image of God of time Chronos to be displayed in ASCII art. However, I am not sure about the image.
Poseidon holds the trident, Zeus the lighting and so on. Does Chronos have any distinctive "item" or anything on his pose that would distinguish him from the others?

A:

Under the post of God of Time, I was told that he usually holds a Zodiac Wheel and/or a Scythe (reminds me of a modern Hades with this one).
