Q:

What demons/fabulous creatures did the Sumerians mention?

I'm looking into fabulous creatures and demons specifically in Sumerian texts, or in Akkadian texts but where the creature/demon still had a Sumerian origin. I can't seem to find a complete list, if it even exists, and many which are listed in various places on the internet are extremely suspect. What I have so far:

Anzu bird
Asag
Bull of Heaven
Galla (same as Galatura?)
Humbaba
Kurgara
Namtar

What else is out there from the Sumerian side? Any fabulous creatures at all would be helpful, but I hope to find specifically more demons and monsters.

A:

A couple come to mind, though, of course, I make no claim I can provide anything like a complete list:

Tiamat - Primodial ocean goddess, Antagonist to Marduk in the Enuma Elish.
Lilitu / Lillith - Appears notably in the Huluppu Tree (as well as appearing in Hebrew texts, of course)
Lamassu - Human head, animal body and wings.  Fairly common in art.
Lamaštu - Child-snatching demoness, discussed at length in F.A.M. Wiggerman's Lamaštu, Daughter of Anu
Pazuzu - Protective wind demon, invoked especially against Lamaštu (also discussed thoroughly in Lamaštu, Daughter of Anu)

F.A.M. Wiggerman's Mesopotamian Protective Spirits:  The Ritual Texts, particularly Section VII "Inventory of Monsters, Brief Discussions" (starting page 143).
Subsection C there gives histories of the following monsters, who are part of the army of Tiamat in the Enuma Elish (which is also discussed here in some depth):
-Lahmu : "the Hairy One"
-Bašmu : "Venomous Snake", "Birth Goddess Snake"
-Mušḫuššu : "Furious Snake", "Aweful Snake"
-Ugallu : "Big-Weather Beast", "Big Day"
-Uridimmu : "Mad Lion"
-Kusarikku : "Bison", "Bison(-bull)"
-Girtablullû : "Scorpion-Man"
-Urmahlullû : "Lion-Man"
-Kulullû : "Fish-Man"
-Suhurmasu : "Carp-Goat"
