Q:

Are there freely available texts of Geseriad in English?

I was trying to do some research of Geseriad (aka Epic of King Gesar/Kesar) details (for this), but while I found a couple of academic references, some even re-telling many parts of the epos, I wasn't able to find freely available text (in English telling or translation) of ANY version of Geseriad, Tibetian or Mongolian or Chinese.
Is there one that escaped my notice?
I'm fine if it's a very close re-telling, and not literal translation, e.g. like "The Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling" By Alexandra David-Neel.

A:

You can find this one, certainly not the best, but a good one, and as free as you like.
