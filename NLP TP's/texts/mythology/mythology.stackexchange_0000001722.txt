Q:

Who was the goddess, pregnant with Zeus' child or children, who was denied sanctuary?

A certain goddess, having been impregnated by Zeus, was driven from her home by the ever-angry Hera, and forced to flee, with her children or child, unsure. Everywhere she went she was rejected in fear of Hera's wrath. At one notable place she stopped to rest and some rude men drove her away. A god or goddess saw this and changed them into frogs.       

A:

Latona
According to this story:

The goddess approached, and kneeling on the bank would have slaked
  her thirst in the cool stream, but the rustics forbade her.

When the people reject her, Latona turns them into frogs:

Latona was so angry that she ceased to mind her thirst. She no longer
  supplicated the clowns, but lifting her hands to heaven exclaimed,
  “May they never quit that pool, but pass their lives there!” And it
  came to pass accordingly. They now live in the water, sometimes
  totally submerged, then raising their heads above the surface or
  swimming upon it. Sometimes they come out upon the bank, but soon leap
  back again into the water. They still use their base voices in
  railing, and though they have the water all to themselves, are not
  ashamed to croak in the midst of it. Their voices are harsh, their
  throats bloated, their mouths have become stretched by constant
  railing, their necks have shrunk up and disappeared, and their heads
  are joined to their bodies. Their backs are green, their
  disproportioned bellies white, and in short they are now frogs, and
  dwell in the slimy pool.”’

Latona is the Latin version of the goddess Leto, famous as the mother of Artemis and Apollo. 
As Wikipedia says:

In Roman mythology, Leto's equivalent is Latona, a Latinization of her
  name, influenced by Etruscan Letun.
