Q:

Can you help me identify this creature?

I bought this necklace recently which had no info about the creature on it. I was just wondering if it's just made up or if it features in any myths/legends? Thanks

A:

It's Saint Christopher.

(For that one down voting: you're right, thank you & pardon me: )

That was fun to figure out, thanks.
The best, W.D.S
