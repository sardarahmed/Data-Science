Q:

How did Aphrodite even help the Trojans during the Trojan war?

I am a Latin student, and currently studying the Trojan war myths
How could Aphrodite, being the goddess of love (being  almost as far from a war goddess as possible) help Paris and the Trojans during the Trojan war?

A:

Being the goddess of beauty and love doesn't turn Aphrodite harmless. Quite the contrary...
Theoi site gives a full summary of Aphrodite's role in the Trojan war.

Convinced Ares to side with the Trojans.
Saved Paris when he lost his duel against Menelaus.
Wounded by Diomedes while trying to save Aeneas. 
Takes part in the battle of the gods after Patroclus's death.
She and Apollo protected the corpse of Hector until it could be ransomed by his father Priam.

And this is only in the Iliad, Aphrodite also protects Aeneas (his son), helping him escape after the fall of Troy, and saves Helen from the wrath of Menelaus, rekindling their love.
It's also notable that in the myths, the Trojan War is originated by love and a beauty contest in which Aphrodite bought the jury (Paris) by offering him the most beautiful mortal in the world to be his wife, which happened to be Helen.
