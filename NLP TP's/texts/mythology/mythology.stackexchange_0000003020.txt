Q:

What happens to dryads when their tree is destroyed?

What happens to dryads, the tree nymphs of Greek mythology,  when their tree is cut down, burned or otherwise destroyed? Do they die or do they move on to a new tree?

A:

According to the tale of Erysichthon of Thessaly and his daughter Mestra - as relayed by Ovid - dryads do not survive the destruction of their tree:

But Erysichthon, heedless of all things,
  ordered his slaves to fell the sacred oak,
  and as they hesitated, in a rage
  the wretch snatched from the hand of one an axe,
  and said, “If this should be the only oak
  loved by the goddess of this very grove,
  or even were the goddess in this tree,
  I'll level to the ground its leafy head.”
  So boasted he, and while he swung on high
  his axe to strike a slanting blow, the oak
  beloved of Ceres, uttered a deep groan
  and shuddered. Instantly its dark green leaves
  turned pale, and all its acorns lost their green,
  and even its long branches drooped their arms.
  But when his impious hand had struck the trunk,
  and cut its bark, red blood poured from the wound,—
  as when a weighty sacrificial bull
  has fallen at the altar, streaming blood
  spouts from his stricken neck. All were amazed.
  And one of his attendants boldly tried
  to stay his cruel axe, and hindered him;
  but Erysichthon, fixing his stern eyes
  upon him, said, “Let this, then, be the price
  of all your pious worship!” So he turned
  the poised axe from the tree, and clove his head
  sheer from his body, and again began
  to chop the hard oak. From the heart of it
  these words were uttered; “Covered by the bark
  of this oak tree I long have dwelt a Nymph,
  beloved of Ceres, and before my death
  it has been granted me to prophesy,
  that I may die contented. Punishment
  for this vile deed stands waiting at your side.”
