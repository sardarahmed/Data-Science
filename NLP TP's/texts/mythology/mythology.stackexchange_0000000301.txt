Q:

What is the significance of gods eating offspring in Greek mythology?

In Greek mythology Cronus ate his children. After he dies Zeus eats Metis, while she is pregnant with Athena.  What is it with gods eating their children?

A:

I remember reading a reference of a tale (I think it was on Joseph Campbell's Hero of Thousand Faces, but I have to search for this passage and than provide a proper quotation and reference here) in which a man sees a pregnant woman who walks next to the river shore. Then, she gives birth to a child and after that, here face transforms on that of a hideous monster, devours that child she just gave birth to an leaves.
Many deities are both givers of life and bringers of destruction. You (as a creation-child of this divinity) are given a life, but are irremediable condemned to die too. Time, embodied by Chronos will give you origin, but then you'll age, and Time will eventually take your life. This duality bringer of life/destruction applies to many divine entities (there is no Life without Death) and highlights the cyclic nature of life/time in many different cultures.
So, the significance of eating its own children is that the creator divinity gives its creations a life which will have an end. There is a cyclic nature for birth, death and (re)birth and the divinity does not consider the death of the creations-children as something evil (even if its eating them). It is part of the cycle.
