Q:

Where does the idea of counting crows come from?

According to Learn Religions and many astrology websites, the number of crows you see predicts the future:

"Seeing just a single crow is considered an omen of bad luck. Finding
  two crows, however, means good luck. (Three crows mean health, and
  four crows mean wealth.) Yet spotting five crows means sickness is
  coming, and witnessing six crows means death is nearby."

Where does this superstition come from?

A:

I did some quick searching and found this page recounting a British nursery rhyme, with the oldest version accounted to be:

One for sorrow, 
  Two for mirth, 
  Three for a funeral 
  And four for birth. 
SOURCE: British Bird Lovers referencing Proverbs and Popular Saying of the Seasons by Michael Aislabie Denham

The rhyme appears to have several subsequent variations over the years.
The tradition of foretelling the future by the flight of birds is known as Augury, and was already ancient by the Classical period.
