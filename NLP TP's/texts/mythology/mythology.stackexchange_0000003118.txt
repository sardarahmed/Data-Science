Q:

Are there religions with no concept of afterlife?

Are there any accepted religions that have never developed a concept for where individuals go when they die? (i.e. Heaven/Hell, Valhalla, reincarnation, etc.)
I only ask because I believe this to be the focal point of most religions: People's belief centering around how they can gain eternal life.

A:

Buddhism has the belief that nothing lasts forever and therefore basically doesn't believe at least in an eternal after life(which is what I believe you were implying).

A passage in the Nirvana Sutra called the “Verse on Impermanence”
  tells the story of Sessen Doji, who, during his Buddhist practice, was
  willing to lose his life in order to hear the teaching he sought:
  All is changeable, nothing is constant. This is the law of birth and
  death. Extinguishing the cycle of birth and death, one enters the joy
  of nirvana. (M.W., Glossary)
  Two principles from the “Four Emblematic Theorems” are
  demonstrated in this passage, i.e., “everything changes, nothing lasts
  forever”, and “nirvana is tranquillity”. link
