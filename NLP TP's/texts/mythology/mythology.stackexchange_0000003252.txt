Q:

Are there any beasts/creatures that "feed on" grief or regrets?

I'm interested in knowing if there are any creatures, monsters, spirits, etc that feed on negative human emotions- specifically grief and regret. Alternately, anything that is specifically attracted to these emotions would also be of interest to me. They can be from any tradition/mythology.
Thanks so much for any answers/ contributions!

A:

I'd suggest doing some reading on Buddhist "demons", the daughters of Mara in particular.
Wiki lists the three daughters as:

Taṇhā ("thirst, desire, longing, greed")
Arati ("aversion, discontentment")
Raga (""greed, sensuality, lust, desire")

The wiki also mentions two other daughters, associated with Pride and Fear.
There is definitely the idea that such demons "feed" on negative human emotions, becoming "stronger" the more a person gives in to these negative feelings.
