Q:

Greco-Roman stories of a mother losing her daughter?

I am looking for Greco-Roman stories of a mother losing her young daughter and the grief that takes place as a consequence of such. I am writing a play where a similar thing occurs and would like to make an allusion to classical mythology. (the story could be from anything classical, even folklore is fine, although stories which are too obscure might defeat the purpose of making an allusion.
Any insight would be humbly and greatly appreciated.

A:

Some famous stories:

Demeter and Persephone, as already mentioned by Malady
Clytaemnestra and Iphigenia (Euripides' Iphigenia in Aulis)
Hecuba and Polyxena (Euripides' Hecuba)
