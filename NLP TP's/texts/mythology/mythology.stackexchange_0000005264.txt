Q:

Does Odin have fish to tell him what goes on in the seas?

Odin has two wolves to inform him about land events ... two crows to cover the skies, but what about the seas? Does Odin have fish servants?

A:

No
First, note that the the only detail that we learn about the wolves, Gere and Freke, in Snorri's Edda is that they are being fed by Odin when he sits at his table; they are not in any way explicitly associated with information gathering. That is solely the domain of the ravens Huginn and Muninn. This is emphasized by the names: "Gere" and "Freke" means 'greedy' and 'gluttonous', "Huginn" and "Muninn" 'thought' and 'memory'.
The gods in general does not seem very interested in the seas - when Thor goes fishing for the Midgard serpent, he he needs to borrow a boat from the giant Hymir. The sea is the domain of Aegir, another giants that is on good terms with the Aesir and Vaenir, but does not properly belong to them, and his wife Rán. (There is Njörðr, but he had more to do with seafarers and fishermen, not the depths themselves. He is a also a rather marginal gods in the stories).
