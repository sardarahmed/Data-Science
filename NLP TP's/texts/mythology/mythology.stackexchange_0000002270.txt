Q:

Virgin goddesses outside of the Greek and Roman traditions?

The Greeks and Romans seem to have had something of an obsession with virgin goddesses, which seems somewhat counter to pagan traditions in general.  Who are some virgin goddesses not from Greek or Roman mythology?

A:

Well, christianity is kinda famous for being considered non-pagan (at least by christians) and Mary being chaste. She is not technically a goddess, but is a mother to their God.
