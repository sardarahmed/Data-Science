Q:

Are these images of identifiable pre-Columbian mythic entities?

This is the front and back of a t-shirt that was bought in Colombia. Stylistically to my naive layman eyes, they both look consistent with a modern riff on Muisca or Tairona art. Are they identifiable entities in known pre-Columbian mythology? Or are they tourist trap nonsense? (even so, one would think it might have been easier to copy a pre-existing image):

A:

These are, conclusively, Coclé, but the culture appears to be very similar to Tairona.
It appears that these images are near-perfect replicas of the imagery on two Gran Coclé plaques. What appears to be the same entity as the first image is identified here as a "sun deity" and here as a "crocodile god". Cooke and Bray (ref 1) identify this as a "saurian-human figure", and note that Helms (ref 2) makes a strong case that the animals are iguanas. I have unfortunately not been able to find a copy of that paper.
In any case, the two specific images are conclusively from artifacts found at sitio Conte, which are currently at Penn Museum: the saurian-human plaque and the bird figures plaque.

In researching this, I was surprised how similar Tairona art was to precolumbian Panamanian artefacts. Compare, for example these Tairona "twins" (photo: WERNER FORMAN/GTRES, from this National Geographic article):

vs these from the other end of Panama (from Cooke, Bray, ibid., p. 38):
