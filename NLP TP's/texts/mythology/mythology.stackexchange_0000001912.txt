Q:

Are there any gods who are in a different species than humans?

As we probably know, most gods look like humans e.g. Zeus, Osiris. I am interested to find out if there are any gods that are a different species than humans. The only god that I found so far is Ryujin, the Japanese god of the sea, who is in the shape of a dragon.
Are there any other gods like Ryujin?
Note: Gods,like Ganesha and Ra, who have animal heads, are not counted.

A:

The World Turtle (Wikipedia)
This motif is very well known. Not a god per se, but close enough. (Btw: I think it represents a ship).
Rainbow Serpent (Wikipedia)

The Rainbow Serpent or Rainbow Snake is a common deity, often a creator god, in the mythology and a common motif in the art of Aboriginal Australia.
It is named for the obvious identification between the shape of a rainbow and the shape of a snake.

But to be honest everything is an animal in Aboriginal mythology.

A:

Coyote! (A key figure in Navajo mythology.)
Also Iktomi in Lakota mythology.  

A:

The Flying Spaghetti Monster! 
The Flying spaghetti monster is a piece of Spaghetti, which is obviously not human.
