Q:

Why is Athena considered the goddess of both fighting and craft skills?

In all the Olympic Pantheon, Athena was revered as goddess of many things: she is a warrior, representing the "noble" part of war, but she is also the goddess of "feminine arts", like weaving.
How come this goddess is associated with activities so different from one another?

A:

An interesting perspective is given in the Theoi Project webpage Athena, where the goddess was one of a purely ethical divine character and not of one particular naturally manifested physical power.  Specifically, she was considered as a protector of the state in a 'holistic' manner, as explained by the website as:

her power and wisdom appear in her being the protectress and preserver of the state and of social institutions. 

Essentially, she preserves the 'state's prosperity and strength within, as well its defense from those from the outside.  The website authors summarise that:

As Athena promoted the internal prosperity of the state, by encouraging agriculture and industry, and by maintaining law and order in all public transactions, so also she protected the state from outward enemies, and thus assumes the character of a warlike divinity, though in a very different sense from Ares, Eris, or Enyo.

Additionally, Athena is also connected with the invention of the tools and the types of work that men and women did, specifically

in short Athena and Hephaestus were the great patrons both of the useful and elegant arts.
