Q:

Are there any mythologic Gods, creatures or equipment that have "exponential" characteristics?

The hydra is classically described as growing two heads back for every one cut down. Mjolnir, theoretically, became exponentially heavier to the unworthy.
What other Gods, creatures or equipment have powers that are tied to doubling or exponential characteristics?

A:

Not associated with any "gods" as such; there are a large number of folktales containing items with exponential growth. 
The Aarne-Thompson classification system groups many of these stories into category, AT 565. One of the best-known of these is Why the Sea is Salt, where an out-of-control salt mill grinds out an endless amount of salt.
The goings-on in The Sorceror's Apprentice certainly smack of the Lernaean Hydra, but that one is more literary than folkloric.
And of course there is the matter of how darn fast that beanstalk grew...

A:

There is an Asura in Indian mythology called RakthaVija. It is difficult to see if his growth is technically exponential. But as the myth goes, he is able to replicate another version of himself from every drop of blood that touches ground ; quite handy skill in a battle. 
As the story goes on, the primary godess (Durga, if I remember correctly) who was meant to kill this asura had to seek help of another godess (Kaali) whose one of the primary instincts is to drink blood. She helped the battle by drinking each drop before it touched the ground. Talk about specialized skill set.
