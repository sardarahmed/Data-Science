Q:

What is the world's oldest joke?

What is the world's oldest joke? I mean the earliest known story, set of affairs, or action that people spread to other people in order to cause the receivers to be amused.

A:

According to Paul McDonald at the University of Wolverhampton, it's this 3900-year-old one, from 1900BC in Sumeria:

Something which has never occurred since time immemorial: a young
  woman did not fart in her husbandâ€™s lap.

(I don't get it either!)
