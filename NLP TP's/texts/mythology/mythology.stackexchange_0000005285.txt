Q:

Who is this Greek goddess?

Please help me identify this Greek goddess statue in the attached image. Who is this? She is wearing a hat of some kind and is holding flowers or some other plants.

A:

Reminds me of a Kore (sculpture) and the plants look like they might be poppy bulbs, which are associated with the Kore (aka Persephone), and her mother Demeter.
