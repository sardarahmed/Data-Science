Q:

Any Good Sources for Aztec Mythology?

Can any kind souls please provide an easily starting point for Aztec Myths and Legends. What Iâ€™ve heard of it is interesting, but the sources I can find, I feel, heavily rely on prior knowledge of the readers/viewers. Any online sources would be much appreciated. Merci Beaucoup!

A:

The only book I have is Douglas Gifford's Warriors, Gods and Spirits from Central and South American Mythology (illustrated by John Sibbick). This book is part of the The World Mythology series, which includes books about, well, mythologies from around the world (non-exhaustive, I'd say). The book is not specifically about Aztec myths, but has a whole chapter about them. Note that this series seems to be oriented to a young adult public, so it might be good as a starting point, but not enough if you need something more in-depth.
