Q:

Why Does the Devil Have a Silver Nose

I recently heard an Italian fairy-tale from a friend, in which a girl rescues her sisters from the Devil's basement. I've identified the tale as How the Devil Married Three Sisters (sometimes Silver Nose or The Devil's Silver Nose). No matter the title, in the story the Devil has a nose made out of silver. Is there a traditional explanation for this, or even other tales where it is mentioned? A peremptory google search and search of this Stack Exchange didn't find me anything besides various tellings and re-tellings of the same story.

A:

Italo Calvino mentioned in his Italian Folktales that the silver nose was rare even in Italian tales.
But a silver nose was sometimes used as a prosthetic, when you lost a nose to syphilis.  Hence, a silver nose is a sign of loose living.
