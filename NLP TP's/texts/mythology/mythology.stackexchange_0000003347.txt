Q:

Do the Egyptian gods bleed?

In the 2016 film Gods of Egypt the gods bleed a bright golden liquid when hurt (which happens often). 
I wonder if there's any basis for this in Egyptian mythology, an Egyptian equivalent to the Greek ichor.

A:

As far as if they do bleed, yes they do:

In a passage of the Book of the Dead, Ra cuts himself, and his blood transforms into two intellectual personifications: Hu, or authority, and Sia, or mind.
  -Ra, As creator

It is highly unlikely that they bled an ichor equivalent otherwise we would've most likely read about it. But as far as bleeding a liquid, in this case blood, yes they do, or at least Ra does.
