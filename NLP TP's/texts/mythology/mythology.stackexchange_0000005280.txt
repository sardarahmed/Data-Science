Q:

Who is the Queen of Heaven in the The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl?

In the The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl classic of ancient China, who exactly is the Queen of Heaven?
Is it Doumu or TheÂ Queen Mother of the West or Wusheng Laomu?

A:

To answer my own question: the Weaver girl is the daughter of the Jade Emperor therefore his wife must be the Jade Empress, the Queen Mother of the West, even though it's not stated in the story itself.
