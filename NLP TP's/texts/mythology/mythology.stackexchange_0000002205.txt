Q:

What are the historical sources for the Illuminati mythos?

Does anyone know anything about the sources of the Illuminati mythology?
I've heard that they're a group of people who are secret masterminds and have done some dreadful things, but is it based on real history or prior myths?

A:

The following work on Freemasonry gives a broad overview of its historical development: from its origins in the era of Solomon's Temple up to the 19th century, with an emphasis on Freemasonry's plans of the past few centuries for the destruction of the Catholic Church:

Msgr. George F. Dillon's Grand Orient Freemasonry Unmasked (audiobook)originally entitled: War of Antichrist with the Church and Christian Civilization

This work frequently discusses Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati.

Regarding Freemasonry's symbolism, see:

Roberts, Allen E. 1975. The craft and its symbols: opening the door to Masonic symbolism. Richmond: Macoy Pub. and Masonic Supply Co.This work is referenced in ex-32Â° Freemason John Salza's 2008 book Why Catholics Cannot be Freemasons, which describes what Freemasonry is in contrast to Catholicism.
