Q:

Why doesn't Sisyphus try to escape?

In the myth of Sisyphus, he pushes a boulder up a hill for all eternity because it keeps falling back down. My question is, why doesn't Sisyphus ever break the conditioning and leave?

A:

Sisyphus is cursed with a compulsion to roll the rock up the mountain. He is incapable of resisting the allure of the job.
And even if he could leave, where would he go? The Fields of Punishment extend for miles and miles, and have thousands of minions whose only purpose is to keep the criminals from escaping. Then there are the Furies, Cerberus, Thanatos...
Suffice to say, escape is not possible mentally or physically for him.
