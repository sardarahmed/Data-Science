Q:

In mythology, where and what was Atlantis?

There has been a whole bunch of speculation of where Atlantis is/ was. It apparently was a myth of a lost city where gods went, and did some stuff. 
But where and what was it in mythology?

A:

First of all, Atlantis was an island - island of the Far West. And the gods were not particularly active in regards to the island.
I would say that Atlantis is absent from mythology, because the first mention that we know of comes from Plato and is used as a vehicle to expand on his political views.
It is in Plato's Timaeus where we are given the location of Atlantis: beyond the the pillars of Heracles (which is today's Gibraltar).
As asked, here is the English quotation - I just do not have access to the Greek original:

For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State
  stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant
  point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the
  whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that
  time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as
  you say, 'the pillars of Heracles',' there lay an island which was
  larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the
  travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from
  the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which
  encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying
  within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a
  narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land
  surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest
  sense, a continent.
