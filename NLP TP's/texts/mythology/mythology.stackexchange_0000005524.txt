Q:

Do all (or most) religions believe in the existence of an afterlife?

I'm talking about both modern and ancient religions that we know of.

Christianity -> Heaven, Hell
Greco Roman -> Hades
Egyptian -> Anubis, Osiris

among many others. Are there any exceptions to this statement?

A:

Buddhism and Hinduism believe in many lives, and do have heavens and hells. 

Naraka (a Hindu hell)
Vaikuntha (a Hindu heaven)

At a high level, a distinction between these two religions is that in Buddhism, everything is impermanent and therefore illusory (including heaven and hell), as opposed to the Hindu conception of everything as cyclic and eternal.

Tian (the Chinese heaven)
Diyu (the Chinese hell)

The Chinese tradition is equally rich, and a function of some degree of syncretism between Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and traditional folk religions.
