Q:

What does this pendant/symbol mean?

This has been antagonizing me for months. When I asked my mom what this was, she said, apart from a bookmark, it was a Celtic knot. But when I look it up, I get anything but this. 
What is this? What does it mean? Is it from the Celtic culture?

A:

It  looks like a kind of square/cross or octagon.

Square / cross is symbol of Tetragrammaton, the four-letter biblical name of the God.
Octagon is the ultimate balance between physical and invisible forces. Harmony and perfect equality between matter and spirit. The oneness of the two. The male and female as one. The fully aware humanity. Exhalation of the breath of creation. It is completion of a cycle and infinity of consciousness.
