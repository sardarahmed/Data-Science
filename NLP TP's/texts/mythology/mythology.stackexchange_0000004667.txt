Q:

Why wouldn't Zeus give Aphrodite to Ares when he was the obvious choice?

Why did Aphrodite have to marry Hephaistos, when Ares was the obvious choice?
As I understand it, the reason for the marriage to Hephaistos, was because Aphrodites' beauty caused conflict. Wouldn't it make more sense to give her to the powerful Ares? So that whoever would try to get his hands on her, would be crushed by Ares. They were lovers anyways, so why wasn't Ares chosen as her husband?

A:

Aphrodite was the goddess of love. She was described as exceedingly beautiful. And no matter what happens, she was going to get lovers. By giving her to Hephaestus, Zeus effectively ruled out a chance of a civil war breaking out between the gods. Obviously, Aphrodite wasn't going to be pleased by a cripple, and she would willingly have affairs with the other gods. And Hephaestus wasn't going to do anything about it. (Although he did, but that's another story)
