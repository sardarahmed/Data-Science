Q:

What is that on Athena's chest?

In this statue there is something what looks like a face on Athena's chest. I have seen it on some other statues of Athena. 
What is it?  Is there a myth behind it? 

A:

It's not clear from your picture, but the face is most probably a Gorgoneion, a recurring element of Athena's iconography:

In Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion (Greek: Γοργόνειον) was a special apotropaic amulet showing the Gorgon head, used most famously by the Olympian deities Athena and Zeus: both are said to have worn the gorgoneion as a protective pendant. It was assumed, among other godlike attributes, as a royal aegis to imply divine birth or protection, by rulers of the Hellenistic age, as shown, for instance, on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo.
