Q:

Airs composed by priest in Hebrew perhaps?

I am solving crossword and one of the clues says, 
Airs composed by priest in Hebrew perhaps
The answer to which is Israeli, as found on the Internet. 
Could someone please explain it to me, what does “Airs” mean in this context and why is the answer “Israeli”? Does this have a mythological base ? 

A:

"Airs composed" indicates an anagram of "airs". "By" indicates concatenation. "Priest" refers to Eli (from the book of Samuel). That's the cryptic half of the clue, and it yields ISRA+ELI. And "Israeli" = "in Hebrew perhaps".
