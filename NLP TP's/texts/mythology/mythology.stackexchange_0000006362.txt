Q:

What is the fable character of a tiger?

In beast fables, the animals are very fixed in character to convey the meaning -- foxes and ravens are crafty, bears are strong but stupid, wolves are fierce, and lions are commanding frequently to the point of being tyrannical.
In regions where tigers are common, what sort of character are they depicted as in fables?

A:

In Indian folklore, a popular tale is "The Brahman, the Tiger, and the Six Judges". Another popular one is "The tiger, the fox and the hunters". 
Here's a few more tales from Malaya & Pakistan.
In most, the tiger is deceitful and not too bright.
