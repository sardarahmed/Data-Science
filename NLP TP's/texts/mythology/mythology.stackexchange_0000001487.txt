Q:

Are there any universal creatures in all of the myth systems?

When reading the Egyptian myths I was struck by their similarity to Greek myths.
This lead me to wonder whether any non human creature (so no ghosts, giants or dwarfs) appears universally or nearly universally across many cultures myths. 

A:

It has long been a popular fantasy among amateur students of myth that all peoples share the same stories. This is clearly an example of wishful thinking.

(Alan Dundes)
Folklorists have developed these tools called Motif Indexes. I'm not quite sure what you mean by "non human creature", but creatures like phoenix have entries in the index. A motif index would then list every culture that contains a myth/story about phoenix. The key here is that there isn't a single example that we can point to where the motif is universal, i.e. it is present in the stories of every culture known to mankind.
So no, there isn't an example of a "non human creature" that "appears universally or nearly universally across many cultures myths."
If you're interested in the similarities and differences between the stories of different cultures, then I would recommend that you learn more about motif indexes.
