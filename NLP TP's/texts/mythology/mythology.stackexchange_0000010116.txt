Q:

Which world mythologies depict humans directly harming or killing gods in combat?

In The Iliad, the Greek warrior Diomedes directly attacks and wounds both Aphrodite and Ares in a single day. He does so with the blessing of Athena, but the story makes it clear that it is Diomedes himself delivering the blows, not Athena on his behalf: divine assistance notwithstanding, this is direct human-on-god violence. And the blows, while not life-threatening, are serious enough to immediately drive both gods from the battlefield in distress to go seek healing on Olympus.
Iâ€™m sure that world mythologies are full of stories about humans fighting minor sprites and magical creatures, but Aphrodite and Ares are Olympians, the A-List deities of their pantheon.
Do any other mythologies depict their top-tier gods as vulnerable (even through the aid of other gods) to direct violence from mortal humans?

A:

Examples spring to mind from Hindu and Christian traditions:

Krishna himself departed as he had prophesied. . . . a hunter from a distance mistook the soles of his feet for a bird, and shot an arrow, thus ending the tenure of the eighth avatar of Vishnu on earth.

R. K. Narayan. The Mahabharata: A Shortened Modern Prose Version of the Indian Epic. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2000. Pp. 178-79.
The Passion of Christ is also represented as human-inflicted.
