Q:

Is Greek mythology derivative of/influence by Ugartic/Canaanite mythology?

I know that the character of 'Adonis' is of Phoenician origin, but there are many other parallels which are too many to be ignored:
Phosporus- Shahar
Hesperus- Shalim
Zeus/Poseidon/Hades- Baal/Yamm/Mot
Athena- Anat
Aphrodite- Astarte
Heracles- Melqart
And is there a possible link between Pandora and the Biblical Eve?

A:

As Gibet noted, there are similarities between Baal and Zeus but they're pretty loose.
However, if you're looking for a Near Eastern analogue to Zeus and Kronos, you need to go to the Hittite/Hurrian myth of Kingship in Heaven, which is very similar to the story of Ouranos-Kronos-Zeus.  
The middle god, Kumarbi, even bites off his father's genitals, just like Kronos castrated Ouranos, but in the Hittite myth Kumarbi becomes pregnant with three gods, and has to spit them out from his belly. When the Storm-God Teshub takes power there's a battle between him and Kumarbi, just like the Titans and Olympians.  
PS - This paper (pdf) discusses similarites in the Kingship in Heaven theme across Greece and the Near East generally.
