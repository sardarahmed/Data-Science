Q:

Name of Electra's brother

In Sophocles' Electra, it is revealed at the end that one of the guards there is Electra's long lost brother. What is the name of this guard? I have looked for it online, and in the book he is referred to by his title.

A:

While the passage in question is unreadable through Google Books, I fear you've just misunderstood the translation. This is the part, right?

That's not her brother. She has but one brother, Orestes, and the "guardian" is actually the pedagogue (paidag≈çgos).
