Q:

What does these runes say?

I was thinking of a tattoo with Nordic influence, I found this picture and I love it, but I need to know what it says (if it says anything), information about the symbols (like Yggdrasil or the Crows of Odin) would be very appreciated.

A:

As explained, the runes say "not all who wander are lost" (in English and in a very nonrunic mode) a line referring to Aragorn.
The two ravens are most likely Huginn and Muninn, OÃ°in's birds that would fly all over seeing what's to be seen.
The rune staff below seems to have originated in a 19th century collection of runic spells. Description.
The interlocking triangles are the valknutr, a widespread Germanic symbol.
The runes on either side of the tree are jera (year) and dagaz (day) and are elder futhark. The tree could very well be Yggdrasil, the worldtree.
