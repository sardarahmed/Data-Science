Q:

How were the days of the week named?

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. How did these get their names? Was it from one religion, or did multiple religions adopt and change them?
I know that the Norse named some of these dates after their Gods, but which ones, and how were they altered through time?

A:

In English (and most germanic languages) the days of the week come mainly from gods from the Germanic faiths. 

Monday = Day of the moon
Tuesday = Day of Tyr
Wednesday = Day of Wodan/Odin
Thursday = Day of Thor
Friday = Day of Freya (or perhaps Freyr)
Saturday = Day of Saturn (Roman influence)
Sunday = Day of the Sun
