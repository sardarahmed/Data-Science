Q:

How old is the belief that spilling salt is unlucky and should be followed by throwing a pinch of salt over the shoulder?

In much of Europe it is believed to be unlucky to spill salt, and it is thought advisable that someone who spills it should throw a pinch of it over their left shoulder. How old is this belief?

A:

Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable claims the superstition dates to the Romans, when salt was used in sacrifices and spilling it from the head of the victim would be considered a bad omen:

Spilling salt was held to be an unlucky omen by the Romans, and the superstition remains to this day, though, with us, the evil may be averted if he who spills the salt throw a pinch of it over the left shoulder with the right hand.  In Leonardo da Vinci's famous picture of the Lord's Supper, Judas Iscariot is known by the salt-cellar knocked over accidentally by his arm.  Salt was used in sacrifice by the Jews, as well as by the Greeks and Romans; and it is still used in baptism by the Roman Catholics.  It was an emblem of purity and the sanctifying influence of a holy life on others...  Spilling the salt after it was placed on the head of a victim was a bad omen, hence the superstition.
