Q:

What is special about children of Athena?

Taking an example from Rick Riordan's Greek Mythology series, Annabeth herself complained for not being able to do anything as a daughter of Athena. All other children, even minor gods seem to have way more power and strength than Athena's children.
Besides strategy/war, intelligence and planning, what other powers do these children have? How could they possibly compare to other demigods that can fly, or summon hurricanes? Even a benevolent goddess like Aphrodite has kids that can "charmspeak" or will others to do things just from voice.

A:

In Greek mythology, Athena swore herself to virginity, she had no children born from her. According to some localized myths, she adopted a single child, born from Gaia called Erichthonius.
Rick Riordan's Annabeth has no Ancient Greek mythological basis. Etymologically, Annabeth is not even a Greek name. It's a combination of "Anna" & "Elisabeth", both Hebrew in origin.
