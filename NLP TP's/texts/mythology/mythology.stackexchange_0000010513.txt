Q:

If angels cannot reproduce, then why did God castrate the angel Samael?

It's a common belief that angels are incapable of reproduction, if that is so then why is there a story about God castrating the angel Samael, he wouldn't need to if angels cannot procreate.

A:

The answer is given in the very quotation you cite:  in that tale, angels can indeed procreate, and have "demonic offspring."
Tales frequently are inconsistent.
