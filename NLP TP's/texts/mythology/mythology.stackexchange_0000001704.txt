Q:

Are aakors mythological or copyrighted?

A friend of mine thinks that an aakor is a creature from the Greek mythology. When I search for "aakor", I see a wiki based on a copyrighted series. I'm not sure if he's correct so I'm asking here.
Are aakors mythological or copyrighted?

A:

I can find nothing to suggest the term "aakor" is any older than the role-playing book you've already seen.  I think it would be safe to conclude they made up the name (I don't know if the name is copyrighted, per se).
As far as a winged wolf in Greek mythology, none to speak of.  You can find an artifact of the Scythian steppe nomads, though:

(A couple other sources do refer to this as being a depiction of a winged wolf:  here and here, if you have trouble being quite sure of what, exactly, is depicted here, as I do)
The Scythians were certainly not Greeks, but they were concurrent with and known to the Classical Greeks, so not as far flung as it could be, I suppose.
