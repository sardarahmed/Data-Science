Q:

What happened if a god or goddess had his/her head cut off?

So in mythology, most gods and goddesses are immortal. But you can't really live once you have your head cut off.
So, specifically Greek mythology, what would happen if your head got cut off, and you were an Olympian or lesser god??

A:

From Here,
Zeus didn't have his head chopped off, but one could argue that the damage from having an adult armored female inside his head, which was removed by cracking open his skull should be equally lethal or incapacitating. Yet all he felt was a headache.
From Sacred Texts,

Born from his sacred head, in battle-array ready dight,
  Golden, all glistering. Fear took hold of them all at the sight--
  Them, the Immortals; but she, before Zeus of the Ã†gis-shield,
  Burst and flashed and leaped in birth from the deathless head,
  Shaking a sharp-edged spear.

A:

Kronos was chopped into pieces and scattered across Tartarus, but it's specifically noted that said trip through the celestial Cuisinart did not kill him. (Some stories later have it that Kronos was released from Tartarus and set to rule over the Isle of the Blessed.) If being julienned isn't enough to kill an immortal, mere decapitation probably isn't either. Not to mention all the divine cannibalism that went on.

A:

It would cause them pain, but the gods are immortal. It would likely work just like it did with Prometheus, it would just grow back. Granted, Prometheus just lost his liver every day, not his head. Also, Zeus had his skull split open to get rid of the headache that was Athena, and that worked out fine.
