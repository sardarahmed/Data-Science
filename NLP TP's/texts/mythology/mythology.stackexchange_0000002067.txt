Q:

Who was the ruler of the Japanese Yomi?

The Japanese Underworld (Yomi) is said to be ruled by Izanami. However, in the tale of ÅŒkuninushi, Susanno is said to reside there as its king. In addition to that, Izanamzi told Inzangi that she had to ask for permission to get out of Yomi.
Who did she need to ask for permission? A ruler/god of Yomi? Who is the real ruler of Yomi?

A:

As I understand it, Izanagi is the original ruler of Yomi, however, when Susanoo was banished there, he became ruler.
Texts on Yomi are very scarce, and finding out exactly how he became ruler, and what later became of Izanagi, remain scarce. I'll do some investigating soon for you.
