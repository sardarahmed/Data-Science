Did Egyptians worship feline and canine gods at the same period in history?  

A:

Dog and Cat deities were worshiped together as early as the Second Dynasty (2890 BCE) in the forms of Anubis and Bastet, but the recorded worship of Anubis dates back to even the First Dynasty (3100 BCE). Bastet's worship centered around the city of Bubastis, while Anubis took a central role in the afterlife as ruler of the underworld until this reign was passed to Osiris the evolving mythology of the Middle Kingdom.
