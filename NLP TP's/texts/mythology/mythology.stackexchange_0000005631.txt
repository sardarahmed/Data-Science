Q:

Do all gods and goddesses live on Mount ÎŸlympus?

Do all Greek gods and goddesses live on Mount Olympus? Including minor ones like Echo, Narcissus, etc.?

A:

No. 
Both Hades and Poseidon, Zeus's brothers, prefer their own domains to Olympus. Hades lives in the underworld and Poseidon in the sea, near Euboea.
Hephaestus, another one of the dodekatheon, lived on Lemnos island after Hera ejected him from Olympus. In Thracian mythology, Ares prefered Mount Haimos in Thrace to Olympus. 
Minor gods could also live elsewhere. A couple of examples from the Odyssey is Circe who lives on the mythical island Aeaea and the nymph Calypso who lives in Ogygia.
