Q:

English transliteration of the Persian word for werewolf?

I have found that the Persian word for werewolf is (گرگینه) which the closest English transliteration I can find is "grgynh". Does anyone know of better transliteration, that lends itself to being pronounced more easily? Or an older term for werewolf from this region, like Avestian? I have found varka as Avestian for wolf.

A:

This may seem odd, but I'm answering my own question. The transliteration answer for  (گرگینه)  is gorgine. I found the answer here: https://www.wordsense.eu/werewolf/ and the audio pronunciation here:
