Q:

Did any Greek mythological hero father a son who surpassed him in fame?

I can't think of any case of a Greek mythological hero having a son who achieved more fame, glory and "heroic status" than him.
Looking the descendency of Perseus, Heracles, Theseus, Jason, Achilles, Odysseus, etc, they all had sons. Some of them were noble and quite heroic, but still they were way far from achieving the feats and fame of their fathers.
So, is there any case in Greek mythology of a son surpassing or even equaling the fame of his heroic father?

A:

If you only look at the greatest Greek heroes, yes, of course their offspring don't surpass them. They are the greatest heroes, after all. I mean, Telemachus is no slouch, but you're comparing him to Odysseus. 
The greatest heroes do have heroic fathers as well:

Peleus was king of the Myrmidons, a member of the Argonauts, and participant in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. He overcame the sea nymph Thetis with the help of a god, to gain her as his wife, and it was at his wedding feast that Eris would interrupt with her famed apple, starting a chain of events that would lead to the Trojan War. He was surpassed by his son, Achilles.
Aegeus was the conqueror and founder of Athens. He is the namesake of the Aegean Sea. He was surpassed by his son, Theseus.
LaÃ«rtes was king of the Cephallenians, a member of the Argonauts, and participant in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. He was surpassed by his son, Odysseus.

A:

Achilles son of Peleus. 
Peleus was a minor hero and companion of Hercules in various of his adventures, and was also with Jason as an Argonaut. 
His son Achilles was more famous as the leading warrior of the Trojan War.
