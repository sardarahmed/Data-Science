Q:

What's The Best Source On Odin and Freya?

I would like to delve in Norse Mythology, but there is an extreme difference between the versions of it I come upon. I am most fascinated with the idea, that the Goddesses of Freya and Frigg are one being and Odin is actually Freya's consort. Where can I read more about this?

A:

The best original sources for Norse Mythology are the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda.   You can also find skaldic poems on a website curated by the University of Aberdeen.  
As far as academic work on the subject are concerned, Mogk's Germanische Mythologie seems to discuss about Frigg and Freya from pages 369 to 373, though the text is in german (Mogk is one of the scholar who identified Oðinn with Oðr, so I assume he has something to say also on the identification of Frigg with Freya); and more recently Stephan Grundy wrote a chapter on Freya and Frigg in The Concept of the Goddess.
