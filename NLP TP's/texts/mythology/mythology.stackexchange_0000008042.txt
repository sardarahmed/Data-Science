Q:

What country is related to a phenomenon which is related to Cronus?

We were given this puzzle in class and i have no idea, any help would be appreciated

A:

Cronus (Saturn) and Jupiter merge, causing the Bethlehem star phenomenon.
That said, Bethlehem is in Palestine.
This is probably the answer.
