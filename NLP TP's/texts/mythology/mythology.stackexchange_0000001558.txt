Q:

What was the earliest werewolf myth?

So, the earliest werewolf I can find is in Greek times.
But, was there ever an earlier werewolf myth?

A:

There's a wolf transformation in the Epic of Gilgamesh, and as written texts go they don't come any earlier. Although in this case it was a spell cast upon him and he never had a chance to transform back into human form.
There may of course be earlier oral mythology.
