Q:

What are the "Treasures of the Dragon Kings"?

I found reference to the "Treasures of the Dragon Kings" whilst in this wiki article on mythological objects.

Ǒusībùyúnlǚ (Cloud-stepping Boots or Cloud-stepping Shoes), made of lotus fiber, these are one of the treasures of the Dragon Kings; Ào Ming gives them to Sun Wukong in order to get rid of him when he acquires the Ruyi Jingu Bang. (Chinese mythology)

What are the remaining treasures?

A:

This comes from the Journey to the West, when the monkey king Sun Wukong "visited" the Dragon King of the East Seas for a weapon. Each of the dragon kings produced a treasure to appease him into leaving in a full set of armaments. Theses were:

The According-To-Your-Wishes Gold-Banded Rod, from the Dragon King of the East Seas.
The Lotus-Threaded Cloud-Stepping Treads, from the Dragon King of the North Seas.
The Golden Chainmail, from the Dragon King of the West Seas.
The Phoenix-Winged Rose-Golden Crown, from the Dragon King of the South Seas.

(These are my own translation, and I tried to be as literal as possible. Published translations of the Journey presumably have different names for these items.)
I wrote up a fuller post with the original text, but apparently the CJK ban is in effect again so I'm unable to post it. I'll amend this post with the item's proper names and the source text if/when the restriction gets rescinded.
