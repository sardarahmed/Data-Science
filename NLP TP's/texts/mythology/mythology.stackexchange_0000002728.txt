Q:

Why is Athena "gray eyed"?

Obviously because her eyes are that color, but I suspect there are deeper, symbolic reasons for that particular color and description.
This is in regard to the epithet γλαυκῶπις, in the lexicon defined as "bright eyed", but which is often translated as "gray eyed" by poets.  

A:

The word γλαυκῶπις shares its root with γλαύξ, the word for owl. 
Owls are known for their large and distinctive eyes, which are adapted for low light hunting. Thus, I believe the epithet is a comment on Athena's perceptiveness, telling us that the goddess of wisdom can see even through the dark. 
You may find more information on Athena's association with owls in Wikipedia.

A:

The currently preferred view of Greek etymologists is that γλαύξ "owl" and the colour-adjective γλαυκός (in Homer the colour of the sea, later generally “grey”) are not etymologically connected. If γλαυκῶπις is connected with the former, then it means "with the eyes of an owl", not "grey-eyed". The owl is Athena’s special animal; she is generally represented with an owl on her shoulder.  

A:

It depends, as Yannis said, on the translation. Wikipedia says:

In Homer's epic works, Athena's most common epithet is Glaukopis
  (γλαυκῶπις), which usually is translated as, "bright-eyed" or "with
  gleaming eyes". The word is a combination of glaukós (γλαυκός, meaning
  "gleaming, silvery", and later, "bluish-green" or "gray") and ṓps (ὤψ,
  "eye, face"). It is interesting to note that glaúx (γλαύξ, "little
  owl") is from the same root, presumably according to some, because of
  the bird's own distinctive eyes.
