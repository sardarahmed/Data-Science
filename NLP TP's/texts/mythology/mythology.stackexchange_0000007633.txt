Q:

Are there any Dragons myths about dragons being the creators of creation? Supernatural beings -as it were - that created the landscape?

I don't have a link to share, just seems to me that ancient man read the landscape and its spiritual and supernatural significance seems to pivot mostly around Dragon myths.

A:

Tiamat:
Tiamat is a Mesopotamian creator goddess who, along with her mate Apsu represent the waters and together give birth to the gods. After the gods murder Apsu to gain power, Tiamat (portrayed as a sea dragon) gives birth to the first dragons and makes war on the gods in revenge. When she is killed by Marduk (sometimes also described as a dragon or being served by dragons), the heaven and Earth are made from Tiamat's body.
