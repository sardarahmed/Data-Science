Q:

Can Thor fly in Norse mythology?

In the Marvel Universe, flight is one of Thor's powers.  (It's been a veeeeeeeery long time since I read the comics, but in the recent films he flies by holding onto Mjolnir's strap or handle, and is pulled along into the air by the hammer itself.)
But my recollections of the Eddas are of Thor doing a lot of walking, and he even seems to slow down Odin and Loki, both expert shapeshifters, when they need Thor's companionship pending confrontations that can only be solved by exceptional feats of strength.  

A:

AFAIK, there is actually nothing that explicitly says that he can fly, even when he uses his chariot. Þrymskviða, verse 21, describes how he goes to Jotunheim:

Then home the goats | to the hall were driven,
  They wrenched at the halters, | swift were they to run;
  The mountains burst, | earth burned with fire,
  And Othin's son | sought Jotunheim.

This does not suggest flying. Furthermore, in Hárbarðsljóð, Thor is returning from Jotunheim in the east, and gets involved in a flyting with a ferryman who refuses to carry him across. It is strange to imagine why he would have to do so if he could have taken his goats instead.
The only thing that comes close is how he is said to cause thunder, but there is no absolute need for that to come from free flight.

A:

He uses his chariot to fly, not his hammer though.

Thor had a chariot to travel across the sky, which was drawn by two giant goats: Tanngniost and Tanngrisnir.

I've never seen anything of Thor flying with Mjolnir. Doing a quick google search yields the same...

However, the mythical version doesn't let Thor fly if he twirls it super fast.
