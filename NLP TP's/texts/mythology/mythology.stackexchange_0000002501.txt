Q:

Are there any groups similar to the muses in other religions?

Are the muses - a set of deities, each corresponding to a specific form of art - a unique Graeco-Roman invention or are there parallels in other mythologies?

A:

Well there is the Norse "muse" Kvasir.
As far as a group of muses in another religion, no I can't think of or find any.
