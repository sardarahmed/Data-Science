To help you with your research efforts, I'm including a note about how I went about compiling information for this answer.   
I did a search for Egyptian gods and found a Wikipedia page with an extensive list of Egyptian Deities. (The list may not be 100% complete, but should be sufficient for undergraduate work. IMPORTANT: Wikipedia on it's own is not generally considered acceptable as a source, but the better articles will include citations to scholarly sources, which are acceptable. Any information that does not carry a citation is considered unreliable and must be externally validated. For university-level work, you are expected read the cited source material, which may involve going to the library;)
Using the master list, I checked each entry, checked for citations, then aggregated into a list of animal-deities. For the most part, I avoided repetition of animals. (There are numerous other instances of Egyptian gods represented as lions and lionesses, which relate to warfare, including Mehit,
 Menhit, Apedemak, Maahes son of Bast, Pakhet and Sheshmetet.)
The wiki for the well-known goddess Sekhmet has a distinct lack of citations, so I went to the Oxford Dictionaries.  For your purposes, this may be a suitable reference.  For instance, the entry on mighty Apis.
