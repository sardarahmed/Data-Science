Q:

If Athena was born from Zeus' brain, does this mean Athena is a manifestation of Zeus' intelligence?

I have heard that Athena was born out of thoughts, sprang from Zeus' head. In that case, does this mean Athena is a manifestation of Zeus' intelligence?

A:

Yes and no.  It depends on how you look at it.
Athena is Zeus' favorite.  She is a "daddy's girl" for sure, siding with the father over the mother in the trial of Orestes. He gives her the aegis to make sure she is protected in battle, and the term "aegis" is still used to connote a form patronage or protection.
In this light, her wisdom, and her springing fully formed from the head of "scheming Zeus", can be seen as manifestations of Zeus' intellect.
By contrast, Zeus swallowed Metis to eliminate the threat of being overthrown by his own offspring, presumably wiser than himself, and in that context the story may be read as Zeus transforming Metis' wisdom into a governable form, so that it may not be used against him.

A:

The Metis story is interesting because according to the prophecy Metis would have two children - Athena and then a son who would ovethrow Zeus. This would have represented a triumph for the Titans, including Metis, over Zeus and his Olympians. So Zeus prevented this next generation from being born by swallowing Metis whole, thus absorbing her wisdom as well.  
So we have to assume that Athena has the prudence and forethought of her mother, and the cunning of her father. (Metis had cunning too, as she came up with the plan to free the Olympians by making Kronos vomit them up.)
