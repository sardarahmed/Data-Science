Q:

Are there myths that contains the concept that people with triple iris eyes are psychic or clairvoyant?

I have heard that those with triple iris eyes were said to be psychic, clairvoyant, etc.  Is this true if so in what myths does this concept appear.

A:

I think the idea that polycoria is linked to special powers must be rather widespread.
Apart from the "third eye" of Indian tradition, we find in Irish tradition the hero CÃº Chulainn has multiple pupils.  According to Britannica: "His prowess was increased by the gift of seven fingers on each hand, seven toes on each foot, and seven pupils in each eye."  It's been a while since I read the Ulster Cycle, but I don't recall him being clairvoyant or psychic per se. He certainly exhibited great physical strength, endurance, agility and beauty beyond that of most other men.
