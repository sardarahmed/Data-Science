Q:

How many types of Nymphs were there?

After reading and answering this question, it caused me to believe that in Greek mythology, there were a lot of nymphs. They were nature spirits, and so, there are a lot of types of nymphs.

Cloud - Nephelai (Cloud-Nymphs)
Grass - Leimonides (Pasture Nymphs)(Close enough to grass)
Flower - Anthousai (Flower Nymphs)

All from here.
So what other nymphs were there?

A:

Nymphs are associated with nature, and nature is expansive. This Source has a list near the bottom of Nymphs, their names, and their classification by dwelling. Classification tends to overlap and it's not always clear.
Obviously with any Mythology there are uncertainties, Nymphs fortunately are one of the easier of the uncertainties. Because they are associated with nature there are the broad categories that they can fit in like Celestial, Land, Wood, etc. which makes listing them a bit easier.
