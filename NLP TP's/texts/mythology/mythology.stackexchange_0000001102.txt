Q:

In Norse mythology, is there a reference to a stone/rock place, entity, object?

I've read up a bit but I'm struggling to get a reference to a place, entity or object consisting or containing stone (or rock).
Are there beings, mythological objects, or locations that are characterised by stone in Norse mythology?

A:

Hrungnir, a mighty jötunn, is said to have a stone head and heart, as well as a stone shield and weapon. He appears in the Prose Edda where he fought and was slain by Thor. A translation of the account can be found here:

Hrungnir had the heart which is notorious, of hard stone and spiked with three corners, even as the written character is since formed, which men call Hrungnir's Heart. His head also was of stone; his shield too was stone, wide and thick, and he had the shield before him when he stood at Grjótúnagard and waited for Thor. Moreover he had a hone for a weapon, and brandished it over his shoulders, and he was not a pretty sight.
