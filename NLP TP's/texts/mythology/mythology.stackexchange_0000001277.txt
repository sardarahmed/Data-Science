Q:

Why were baboons famous in Egypt?

Why were baboons famous in Egypt? They were sometimes kept as pets, had a god named for them, but did they have any significance?

A:

According to William Petrie in his book The Religion of Ancient Egypt, 

"...the serious expression and human ways of the large baboons are an
  obvious cause for their being regarded as the wisest of animals" (22).

He goes on to state that Tahuti, the deity of wisdom, personified by the baboon, existed in Egyptian culture throughout most of its early history. He mentions, too, that baboons were associated with timekeeping due to their tendency to chatter upon the sunrise, and baboons also may have been associated with calendrical timekeeping (Dawn of Egyptian Art p. 236).
It's well known that the ancient Egyptians were devoted observers of astronomical events and had an early hand in timekeeping generally, so (personal stipulation) it makes sense for them to glorify a creature which falls into such patterns naturally.
Regardless of their role, baboons almost certainly held some position of prominence in the culture; in addition to Tahuti and any pet-keeping, it appears statuettes of baboons were constructed as well.
