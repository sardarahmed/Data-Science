Q:

Looking for a mythological flying creatures that has saved human life

Can anyone help me? I am looking for a mythological flying creature(s) that has saved human life?
I am asking for a project in progress. Thanks.

A:

In the Ramayana, when Ram battled Ravan to free his wife Sita, during the battle Ravan's son Megnaad (also called Indrajeet, for defeating Indra, king of the Devas) fired upon Ram's army the Naagpaash, a weapon which would bind the targets with coils of venomous snakes.
Ram, seeing his army's plight, called upon Garuda, mount of Vishnu, who was the mortal enemy of snakes, who are all the snakes tying down Ram's army.
Of course, this technically doesn't answer your question, since Ram and his brother Lakshman were the only humans in his army, which was made mostly of monkeys and bears.
