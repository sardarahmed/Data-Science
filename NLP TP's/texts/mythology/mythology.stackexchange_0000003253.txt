Q:

Are there any four-armed deities or creatures in the Greek or Roman pantheons?

As in the title, are there any four-armed (two-legged) deities or creatures in the Greek or Roman pantheons? Essentially the morphological opposite of centaurs, in terms of limb numbers.

A:

The Actiorione, Siamese twins and sons of Poseidon. They had four arms, four legs and two heads. Hesiod's Catalogues of Women mentions them:

Scholiast Ven. on Homer, Il. xi. 750: The two sons of Actor and
  Molione... Hesiod has given their descent by calling them after Actor
  and Molione; but their father was Poseidon.
Porphyrius,6 Quaest. Hom. ad Iliad. pert., 265: But Aristarchus is
  informed that they were twins, not . . . such as were the Dioscuri,
  but, on Hesiod's testimony, double in form and with two bodies and
  joined to one another.

They also appear in the Iliad; Nestor claims he could defeat them if their father hadn't taken their side (11:750-752) but they beat him a chariot race. (23,638)
