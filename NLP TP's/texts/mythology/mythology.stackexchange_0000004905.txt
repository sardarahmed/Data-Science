Q:

Have Humans ever gone to war against Gods or Entities before?

Was there a time back then when Humans would make a war against a God or an Entity? How did those wars turn out for the two side? Were humans strong enough to make that challenge?

A:

There are plenty of stories out there of Greek gods being fought and defeated!

In Greek mythology, gods were often fought by both other gods and mortals. The mortal Arachne soundly defeated Athena
the demigod Heracles killed a number of Poseidon’s sons
Hades kidnapped the god Persephone to become his wife
the great mortal hero Diomedes injured Aphrodite and Aeneas in battle, etc.

In Jewish theology, Yahweh is supposed to be perfect and undefeatable. Despite this, there are definitely ways you can beat the Jewish God.

When Satan made a bet with Yahweh that Job would turn away from Him, it was completely possible that Job could have failed the test after having his family and slaves murdered. Free will is supposed to be a very important thing to Yahweh, and as such, Job indubitably could have turned away from God.
Why would Satan make a bet with God if he knew that God knew the answer? The bet would have never been made if Job’s fate was already sealed… Satan is described as being too clever to do something so stupid. Job could’ve cursed God, and Satan would have won the fight.
Moses also defeated Yahweh in an intellectual battle. Exodus 32 describes how God wanted to kill all of the Israelites after Aaron made them dance naked around the golden calf. Moses instead reasoned with God and told him to “turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.” God, seeing the wisdom of Moses, changed His mind, thus admitting that Moses’s idea is better than His own. Moses defeated God in a battle of ideas. “…And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.” Nice job, Moses!
