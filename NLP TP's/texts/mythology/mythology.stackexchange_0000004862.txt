Q:

Does Scotland have any discrete mythology not shared by other nations?

As part of the Insular Celts, I know that Scotland shares some Pantheon of Gods with Ireland, Wales and England. 
However, does Scotland have any discrete mythology unique to the Scottish people/land?

A:

Yes.  Below are some I believe hit the mark.

In Scottish folklore, the Loch Ness Monster or Nessie, is an aquatic being which reputedly inhabits Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands.

Wulvers are ofter called werewolves, but legend shows they are quite different. Said to inhabit the Shetland Islands to the north of the Scottish mainland.

The Irish banshee and the Scottish bean nighe tread the darkest of nights as omens from another world, that of the unknown beyond.  Though similar at first glance, they were regarded as quite different beings.

In Scottish folklore the Ghillie Dhu or Gille Dubh was a solitary male faerie. He was kindly and reticent yet sometimes wild in character but had a gentle devotion to children

 A shape-shifting mythical water bird, Boobrie, is a huge, black creature flying through the water and haunting lakes and salt-water wells. In Scottish Highlands, there are many legends of this strange, gigantic bird with webbed feet, at the end of short legs, black wings, claws that resemble human hands and black eyes with a very unnerving and piercing stare, capable to drive a person looking at these eyes – insane

Interestingly, the Blue Men of Minch, also known as Storm Kelpies are unheard of in other parts of Scotland and there are without counterparts in the rest of the world. They should not be confused with the Fin Folk, mythical amphibious sea people on Orkney and Shetland.
