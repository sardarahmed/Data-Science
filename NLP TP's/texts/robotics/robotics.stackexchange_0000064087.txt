Q:

Is SMACH still maintained and used?

Hi all,
I was wondering whether SMACH was stil maintained? Or is this a dying package?
Also is it very much used among the community? Except a few example regarding the PR2 I could not find it used anywhere...
Regards,
Antoine.

+1 I believe some or many researchers using PR2 use smach (I've seen some within the last 1 year) but haven't seen it applied for other robots, although it should be very useful.

Also I just randomly hit an email where @Pi Robot used it.

FWIW, SMACH has been used in many non-PR2 robots.

okey dok, I take note. Thanks ;)

A:

Given that smach is released into Indigo, that's a good sign that it's still maintained.
There are a few open issues, but nothing major. I suspect you could get the maintainer's attention and get a bug fix accepted and released if you found a major bug. That said, smach has been around for many years, and I suspect most of the bugs have been worked out by now; don't confuse a lack of changes for lack of maintenance.

Indeed you are right. Now what do you think of it only being used for the PR2, or so? What do the other robots use then?

I recently used smach for a project on a turtlebot. There isn't anything PR2-specific about it. It just happens that it was written during the early days of ROS, when most people were developing software for the PR2.
