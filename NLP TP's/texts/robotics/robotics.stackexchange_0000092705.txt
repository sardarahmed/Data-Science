Q:

Models for navigation

Hello, I am looking for gazebo models which I can get to create navigation. ( so have to be compatible with rviz). I know that are Turtlebot, husky, dron, Pionner Models, but I want something less standard. Model have to have min 1 sensor which can detect obstacles.
Thanks!
