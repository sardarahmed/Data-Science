A:

You cannot edit this file because this file belongs to user postgres, you didn't have privilege to edit this file.This can be verified by using
ls -l /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_ident.conf 

You can edit this file in two ways.
1.Change to user postgres
sudo su - postgres

Then edit the file by
vim /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_ident.conf

2.Use root privilege to edit the file
sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_ident.conf

If you didn't have vim installed yet, use
sudo apt-get install vim 

Once you enter vim editor, press "i" to become INSERT mode, and you can edit the file. When you finished editing, type ":wq" to save the file and leave vim editor.

When you type sudo su - postgres to become user postgres, the password you need is your original user's.

yes, I have tried my original password ant it worked , but I have stopped at the step of making an administrator of my created database using pgadmin , There was an error that the version of pgadmin isn't suitable to the version of the postgreSQL.
