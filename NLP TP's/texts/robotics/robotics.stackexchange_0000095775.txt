Q:

MoveIt: Is it possible to have different types of controllers in one planning group?

Dear all,
as the question suggests, is it possible to have inside one MoveIt planning group, for example: a FollowJointTrajectory controller along with an effort_controllers/JointPositionController?

A:

It looks like each planning group connects to a single action server advertising the respective action (e.g. /follow_joint_trajectory), but since you can combine multiple planning groups into another one, you should be able to use that meta planning group to control your two subgroups which use different controllers.
If that doesn't work, you could write a custom controller for your robot that accepts the FollowJointTrajectory goal, passes part of it to a "real" FollowJointTrajectory controller and then does something else for a few of the joints.

At least the joint_trajectory_controller from ros_control can be configured to accept partial goals (ie: for only a subset of joints).
This may not need any custom controllers.

I was actually unsure and looked into it a little more. I updated my answer.

Well I'm not sure about the MoveIt side. I just wanted to point out the fact that partial goals are supported, so this could work without needing custom code.
