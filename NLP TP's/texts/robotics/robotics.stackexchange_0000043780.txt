Q:

Compiling learning_image_transport tutorial on fuerte/catkin

Hello,
I try to build the tutorial package learning_image_transport on fuerte/catkin running debian/sid.
I had to install the following packages: pluginlib, opencv2,cv_bridge,image_transport.
I successfully created the package using the following commands:
roscd
roscreate-pkg learning_image_transport image_transport opencv2 cv_bridge
rospack profile
But the compilation fails:
cmake learning_image_transport
[rosbuild] Building package learning_image_transport
[rosbuild] Cached build flags older than manifests; calling rospack to get flags
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack cflags-only-I;--deps-only learning_image_transport
Package pluginlib was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `pluginlib.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'pluginlib' found
CMake Error at /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:129 (message):
Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package
'learning_image_transport'.  Look above for errors from rospack itself.
Aborting.  Please fix the broken dependency!
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:227 (rosbuild_invoke_rospack)
CMakeLists.txt:12 (rosbuild_init)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
The file pluginlib.pc is in /opt/ros/fuerte/share/pluginlib/build/CMakeFiles
How can I add it ?

@joq: The result is the same with rosmake: [ rosmake ] All 25 linesmage_transport: 0.8 ec                                                             [rosbuild] Building package image_transport
No package 'pluginlib' found.

A:

image_transport is not fully migrated to catkin yet since a few dependencies such as pluginlib still needs to be catkinized. Building the package with rosbuild should work.
