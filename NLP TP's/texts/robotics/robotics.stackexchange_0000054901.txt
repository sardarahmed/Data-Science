Q:

using segbot xacro file to generate urdf

Hi,
Recently I am trying to use the segbot xacro file in the urdf and robots folders (https://github.com/utexas-bwi/segbot), However, it turned out that the generated file of URDF is blank.
Could anyone provide some suggestions? Thank you in advance!
Cheers,
Lili
