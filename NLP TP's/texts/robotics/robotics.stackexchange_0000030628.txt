Q:

Should i be able to set the current pose for amcl?

In rviz i can click '2d pose estimate' and it'll say:
[ INFO] [1300880777.184874919]: Setting pose: 52.773 -17.701 3.132 [frame=/odom]
or something. But it won't actually move the estimates that amcl is providing.
Additionally, i don't see a published service or subscribed topic for this in amcl beyond the 'initial' pose. Do i need to change the initial pose and somehow restart amcl?

and the 2d pose esstimate topic is set to "initialpose"
Comment by Murph on 2011-03-28:
Fixed frame is set to /odom currently.

What is your "fixed frame" set to when you do the 2D pose estimate? What topic is set for the "initialpose" topic in rviz?

Also, additionally, should I be able to see the current pose? rviz suppose 'pose' but not 'PoseWithCovarianceStamped' that amcl outputs.

A:

In order for rviz to correctly set the initialpose for AMCL, rviz's fixed frame must be the same as AMCL's map frame.
Change your fixed frame in rviz to /map and then your 2D Pose Estimates should work. You can verify that it is working by subscribing to the PoseArray particle cloud output by AMCL - after a successful estimate, a cloud of particles will be centered on the location you indicated.

Ugh. Seems that my network connection was suspect (I guess the master node couldn't ping the rviz node). -_- your answer was right. thanks!

The cloud of particles does not seem to change location when i do a 2D pose estimate in rviz. I have the fixed frame on /map.

Thank you! Running rviz on the same machine as the master fixed it for me!
