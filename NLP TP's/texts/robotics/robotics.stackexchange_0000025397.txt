Q:

drc_robot appears with no legs and no right hand.why?

Hi,
Whenever I insert drc_robot in gazebo( gazebo 1.2.6 and DRCsim 1.1 Ubuntu 12.04) using gui, I get this error message and the robot appears in the world with no right hand and no legs. What is going on here? Is that supposed to be like this?
   [ INFO] [1353527588.743735461]: Laser plugin missing <hokuyoMinIntensity>, defaults to 101
   [ INFO] [1353527588.743823824]: INFO: gazebo_ros_laser plugin should set minimum intensity to        101.000000 due to cutoff in hokuyo filters.
  [ERROR] [1353527588.745487217]: [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at

Thanks

Thanks. I am not sure what WONTFIX flag means here for this issue.

It means that sometime "soon" this issue will not matter as new files will be shared.
