Q:

unable to set initial pose in gazebo spawn_urdf_model (groovy)

I've just updated from Fuerte to Groovy, and seem to have lost the ability to spawn an object at a given pose. Steps that reproduce this reproduce this problem (after updating to groovy):
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
rosrun xacro xacro.py `rospack find gazebo_worlds`/objects/table.urdf.xacro > /tmp/table.urdf
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -urdf -file /tmp/table.urdf -x 2 -y 2 -z 2 -model table_model

The table will spawn at (0,0,0). Can someone confirm if this is a bug?
Also should the Gazebo ROS wrapper questions (like this one) be asked at answers.gazebosim.org?
Thanks!!

To your 2nd question,

Also should the Gazebo ROS wrapper questions (like this one) be asked at answers.gazebosim.org?

@natekoenig says all Qs should be posted on gazebosim.
(but I feel it's confusing to pure Gazebo users to see ROS-Gazebo topics there)
