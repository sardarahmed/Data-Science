Q:

where can I get dx100 package?

Hi!
I'm a beginner in ROS and now what I focus on is how to build the connection between ROS PC and my robot-controller.In the tutorial of create_joint_position_streaming_interface_using_tcp_socket_libraries, the tutorial told me that

The ROS Code to support this interface can be found in the dx100 package. This code can be reused for different controllers as it was developed genercially.

So I want to download the dx100 package. But I found that I cannot downliad it although I have broken th GFW(proxy), I cannnot download the package from googlecode. This is the link https://swri-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/groovy/motoman.
So can somebody tell me where can I download this package or send one to my mail?(mail:shantengfei@sjtu.edu.cn). Thanks!

A:

The dx100 package doesn't exist any more. The functionality was merged into industrial_core, more specifically: industrial_robot_client and simple_message.

This is the link https://swri-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/groovy/motoman.

And with the shutdown of Google code, this repository was also taken down. Just for reference: a copy of it can be found at ros-industrial/swri-ros-pkg. But please do not use the dx100 package from there: it's old and replaced by other packages.

what I focus on is how to build the connection between ROS PC and my robot-controller

simple_message and industrial_robot_client can definitely be used for that, but it might be worthwhile to discuss your approach a bit, as there may be easier / more straightforward approaches, especially if your robot controller supports something like C/C++ (or any other high-level language) already.
I would suggest sending a message to the ROS-Industrial mailing list.

Thank you， gvdhoorn！my robot controller does support C/C++,but not manufactured by vendor.I just looked through the  ROS-Industrial mailing list and found some similar forum. So what I should do as you said is asking for some suggestions by sending a detailed description to the mailing list right?

Thank you！ gvdhoorn,sorry to bother you again.As you said,the dx100 package was too old.But I want to know the tutorials/create_joint_position_streaming_interface_using_tcp_socket_libraries still avaliable for me to build the server on robot controller?
