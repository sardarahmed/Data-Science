Q:

roslaunch ca_gazebo create_2.launch error

I'm trying to launch a gazebo simulation with this code but run into an error at this step:

https://github.com/frankjoshua/create_autonomy
roslaunch ca_gazebo create_2.launch
[create_2.launch] is neither a launch file in package [ca_gazebo] nor is [ca_gazebo] a launch file name

Console:
