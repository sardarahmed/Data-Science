Q:

pcl and openni_launch question

Hello all,
I am trying to get my Kinect working with the pcl tutorial programs on the ros.org/wiki/pcl/Tutorials website. I have everything build and when I go to run the program I use these commands.
Start roscore.
Ros launch the openni using roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch.
Then rosrun my example program with the input as the openni point2:
rosrun my_pcl_tutorial example input:=/camera/depth_registered/points.
To see if it is running correctly I used rxgraph and unfortunately it says the communication with my_pcl_tutorial failed. Where have I gone wrong here?
Cheers,
Martin

Can you do a rostopic list and then paste the output here as well? It might help with the troubleshooting.

A:

I had to register the depth points using the dynamic reconfigure doh, now rxgraph says it subscribing to the points!
