Q:

The environment variable ROS_HOSTNAME

I have two nodes which communicate with each other with the help of the master. Each node has a specific host name, and this value is stored in node environment variable ROS_HOSTNAME. I want to learn the value of the environment variable ROS_HOSTNAME of my nodes.
How can I learn them ?

A:

The rosnode info command will show the URI (including the hostname) that other nodes will use to reach that node.
(the node's hostname defaults to the computer's hostname, but can be overridden by the ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_IP environment variables)
