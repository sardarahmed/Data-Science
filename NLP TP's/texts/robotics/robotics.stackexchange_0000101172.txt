Q:

Cannot install catkin-tools on Debian buster due to Python version requirement

I installed ROS Noetic on a Debian Buster system, which is listed as a supported platform.
However, I cannot install packages (like python3-catkin-tools) that depend on the python3-osrf-pycommon package because it requires Python 3.8, and Buster provides Python 3.7.
$ sudo apt install -s -o Debug::pkgDepCache::AutoInstall=true python3-catkin-tools
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
  Installing python3-osrf-pycommon as Depends of python3-catkin-tools
    python3-osrf-pycommon:amd64 Depends on python3:any:any < none @un H > (>= 3.8~) can't be satisfied!

Though python3-osrf-pycommon is listed on the package index as not being supported on Noetic...

I think this was a regression introduced in this pull request and hopefully it can be resolved by publishing the right package version for Buster.

A:

Until this bug is resolved it should be possible to do:
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/p/python3-osrf-pycommon/python3-osrf-pycommon_1.0.2-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i python3-osrf-pycommon_1.0.2-1_all.deb

Then continue installing the original package (e.g., python3-catkin-tools).
