Q:

Can uEye_cam capture image with zoom in or out

I have connected the uEye_cam with ROS but the image is too large, so I want to zoom it out a little bit so that it can get more information from the environment. But the functions in uEye_cam don't have a "zoom" function. So I am wondering if this can be done using image_transport or image_pipeline or some other functions. Please help me. Thanks.

A:

From the wiki page, section 2.3:
If you want to downsize the image while preserving the field of view, change one or multiple of the 'sensor_scaling' / 'binning' / 'subsampling' ROS parameters (e.g. set sensor_scaling=2 works in all uEye cameras that I've used).
If however you want to zoom digitally into a portion of the image, you can tweak the 'image_height', 'image_width', 'image_left', and 'image_right' ROS parameters.
Note that you can play with all of these parameters, and more, while running ueye_cam live, using dynamic_reconfigure.
