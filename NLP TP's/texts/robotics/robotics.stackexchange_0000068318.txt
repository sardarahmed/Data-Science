Q:

ROS Backlog Feature Request Priority Criteria

Is there some formal process to support the development of Backlog Feature Requests either by voting or funding?
Thanks,
Matt

A:

Not that I know of. If you're serious about funding, I guess contacting the OSRF would be the first step. As for issues on the various github repositories: a +1 with some rationale or, even better, a pull request that fixes the issue or adds the feature would be the way to get things going.
