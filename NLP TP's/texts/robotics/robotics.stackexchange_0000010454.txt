Q:

How can a DMP be used for simulating physics?

I read a paper from 2015, "Structural bootstrapping - A novel, generative
mechanism for faster and more efficient acquisition of action-knowledge
", which introduces a concept called, "Structural bootstrapping with semantic event chains and dynamic movement primitives," which confused me a little bit. 
According to my knowledge a robotarm is controlled by a PDDL-like planner. The PDDL file is a "qualitative physics engine" which can predict future events. The paper says the "qualitative physics engine" consists of dynamic movement primitive (DMP) which are learned from motion capture data. 
My question is: How can a DMP be used for simulating physics?

A:

I don't know that the DMP method actually simulates physics as much as it copies what it saw, which was an actual, physical system. Note that "qualitative" means essentially "looks like", where "quantitative" means "numerically". 
Qualitative physics simulations are those that look like real physics, but they are not. If I hold a dart in my hand and walk it across the room as though it were in the air, it would look roughly correct, but of course it would not be numerically accurate. So again, I think they're copying what they see and treating it as "good enough."
