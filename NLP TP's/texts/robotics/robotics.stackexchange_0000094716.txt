Q:

Is it possible to get a list of all the current collision objects using the MoveIt API?

Hi, I would like to get a list of all the collision object currently in the planning scene using the C++ MoveIt API.
My main goal is to be able to clear all collision objects in the environment. My approach will be to obtain a list of all the current collision objects which I can then iteratively delete using the object list.
System: Ubuntu 16.04 & ROS Kinetic

A:

Use planning scene interface class to manipulate collision objects. You can directly remove all existing collision objects with removeCOllisionObejects() or get a list of current objects with getCollisionObejcts()
Refer to the related API interface

Thanks, atas.
I'm now able to get a list of the collision objects in the scene using getCollisionObjects(). However, for some reason I'm unable to remove collision objects using removeCollisionObjects().
For example I tried:
int main(int argc, char **argv) 
{
    ros::init(argc, argv, "remove_collision");
    ros::NodeHandle node_handle("~");

    ros::AsyncSpinner spinner(1);
    spinner.start();

    moveit::planning_interface::PlanningSceneInterface current_scene;
    sleep(1.0);

    std::vector<std::string> object_ids;
    object_ids.push_back("box1");
    current_scene.removeCollisionObjects(object_ids);
    ROS_INFO("remove an object from the world");

    ros::shutdown();
}

Perhaps that is a question for a new thread. For now I'm able to remove the objects using the planning scene diffs via a rosservice call to '/apply_planning_scene'.

get a list of current objects with getCollisionObjects()

That's unavailable
