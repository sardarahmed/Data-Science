Q:

link for umd-ros-pkg expired. Please update

Fuerte ubuntu 12.04
Unable to download the gps_umd package from umd-ros-pkg
sai@sai:~$ git clone git://ram.umd.edu/ros/gps_umd.git
Cloning into 'gps_umd'...
fatal: unable to connect to ram.umd.edu:
ram.umd.edu: Name or service not known
sai@sai:~$
I think the repository location is changed.
Please let me know from where the gps_umd package can be downloaded.

A:

It looks like their server is just down, I would suggest contacting the maintainers directly to notify them if they don't already know.
