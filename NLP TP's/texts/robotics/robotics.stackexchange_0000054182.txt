Q:

Where is pcd_viewer in ROS Hydro?

It used to be a part of perception_pcl, in ROS fuerte it moved to the bin folder but now I can't find it anywhere. Where is pcd_viewer in ROS Hydro?

A:

After prodding a while more, I found out pcd_viewer changed its name to pcl_viewer in PCL 1.7 and can be found in /usr/bin/pcl_viewer.
