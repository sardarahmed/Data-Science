Package pcl - Ubuntu 13.10 - Installation ROS Groovy from source

Hello,
I'm trying to install Ros Groovy on Ubuntu 13.10. (Yes Groovy because the last project I used uses it)
I'm following this tutorial: wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Source
But I'm stuck when I try to run this command:
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install-space /opt/ROS/groovy/

make[2]: *** [common/CMakeFiles/pcl_common.dir/src/common.cpp.o] Error 1
make[2]: ***

Linking CXX shared library
../lib/libpcl_io_ply.so 

[  4%] Built
target pcl_io_ply

make: *** [all]
Error 2

<== Failed to process package 'pcl':

Command
'/opt/ROS/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/nodelet_topic_tools/env.sh
make -j8 -l8' returned non-zero exit
status 2

Reproduce this error by running:

==> cd /opt/ROS/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/pcl
&&
/opt/ROS/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/nodelet_topic_tools/env.sh
make -j8 -l8

Command failed, exiting.

I have already checked the pcl_find_ros.cmake and it's seems up to date. (h ttps://github.com/ros-gbp/pcl-release/commits/bf43ffc0eebca4042c6765319c4dd211409d7ace/cmake/pcl_find_ros.cmake)
Any ideas? :\
EDIT:
Command:
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated -j1 --install-space /opt/ROS/groovy/

make[2]: *** [common/CMakeFiles/pcl_common.dir/src/pcl_base.cpp.o] Error 1

I feel like the actual error message is missing here. Do you get any more information by running ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated -j1 --install-space /opt/ros/groovy/ ?
Comment by bapclenet on 2014-02-01:
I edited my post, it's not exactly the same error but quite similar. What do you think?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-02-01:
Can you include more of the error output? I don't see anything that actually looks like an error from the compiler. Ideally, everything from the first error message onward is useful.

Does "VERBOSE=1 ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated -j1 --install-space /opt/ros/groovy/" output more info? If not, run make clean for pcl first (or remove the pcl build dir) and try again with VERBOSE=1 and -j1

Having the same problem here. Any luck with this?

Comment by TSC on 2014-02-11:
Exactly! Thanks ahendrix!
Comment by demmeln on 2014-02-11:
@TSC, what about that full error log with VERBOSE=1 and -j1?
Comment by TSC on 2014-02-16:
@ahendrix, already added -j1. Please, check related question: http://answers.ros.org/question/126846/error-installing-ros-groovy-from-source-on-ubuntu-1310/

A:

@TSC provided output with VERBOSE=1 and -j1 over at http://answers.ros.org/question/126846/error-installing-ros-groovy-from-source-on-ubuntu-1310/
Might be it is the same issue of Eigen / PCL incompatibility here. I just answered there:

It seems like you have a Eigen version
installed that is too new for PCL. It
seems in 3.2 the sqrt function moved
from eigen::internal::sqrt to
eigen::sqrt. See this question:
http://answers.ros.org/question/128916/ros-groovy-compile-fails-at-pcl/
So you could either try to change the
source of PCL or make sure it is using
eigen 3.1 to compile.
