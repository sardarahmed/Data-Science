Q:

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment

Hi,
I'm trying to set my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable permanently. I appended the following line to the etc/environment file: ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="/home/zayin/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks". Then, I logged out and back in. However, when I type echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in the terminal, I get /opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks, which is the initial setting. What have I forgotten to do? Thanks!

A:

Similar questions/answers exist - see here, here.
Unless you add your workspace to the package path in your ~/.bashrc file, each time you open a new terminal you will need to source your workspace (see this tutorial).
To set your workspace permanently, open your .bashrc file in a text editor, for example -- gedit ~/.bashrc -- and add
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/your/path/to/workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

at the bottom of your file. Obviously, make sure you change "/your/path/to/workspace" to your exact workspace path..

I don't understand the last part :$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Should it be like this ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/hjt/catkin_ws/src:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Comment by bemery94 on 2017-02-05:
The ":$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH" means that you are adding "/home/hjt/catkin_ws/src" to the start of the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, whereas if you just did "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=..." then the new ROS_PACKAGE_PATH would overwrite the existing path.
