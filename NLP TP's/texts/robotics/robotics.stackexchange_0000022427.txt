Q:

Equations of motion in matrix form and energy consumption

I am working on Lagrangian derived high-dimensional motion equations for a robot in matrix form. The structure of such an equation is known:
$M(q)\ddot{q}+C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q}+G(q)=0$
In here, $M(q)$, $C(q,\dot{q})$ are matrices, and  $G(q)$ are vector.
Are there any properties of $M(q)$, $C(q,\dot{q})$, $G(q)$ related to the power consumption of the robot and is it possible to optimize power consumption by operating with these very properties?
Remark: I mean they are matrices, vectors, etc., i.e. is it possible to somehow use their traces, determinant, norm and other to use for the study of energy consumption?

A:

Can you set up the problem so that the quantities you care about (e.g. power) are more explicitly represented? Reasoning physically, where could the power go?

Accelerating masses, including rotation
Pushing against gravity, electromagnetics, other potentials
Stretching springs and whatever
Dissipation through friction

You say "optimize power consumption". One could minimize

peak instantaneous power over some cycle of operation
total energy (average power) over cycle
RMS power over cycle
heat dissipation (tight thermal constraints?)

I would choose one of those to optimize, and express it in terms of your system's M, C and G. I would expect properties of the resulting matrix equation(s) to be easier to reason about than the original M, C and G. I know just enough about multidimensional functional minimization of (potentially) nonlinear matrix equations to know I don't want to go there right now (if ever!)
Good luck!
