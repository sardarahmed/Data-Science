Q:

tf timing problem when using STAGE simulation

Hi to all,
I'm currently trying to simulate the behavior of my robot using STAGE simulation but the tf timing from STAGE is too slow with a time interval of 13 x10^6 second. I tried to overcome this problem by overwrite the tf using the static transform publisher but the time become negative with this warning:
TF_OLD_DATA ignoring data from the past for frame /base_footprint at time 12.6 according to authority /Stage_Node
How should i approach this problem?
With thanks,
Zhiping

I'm trying to link the STAGE, move_base and gmapping together in order to simulate a online SLAM. The TF link is /map (slam_gmapping) >> /odom (Stage_node)>>/base_footprint (Stage_node) >> /base_link (Stage_node) >> /base_laser_link (Stage_node)

Can you be a little more specific about your setup.  In general Stage works fine with tf.

A:

With that big of an error, make sure to set /use_sim_time properly before starting all processes.  See the Clock documentation.

Thank a lot. Using simulation time does solve the problem.
