Q:

Add a blind spot to 360 Lidar

So I am using the Neato Lidar which is 360.  However if part of it is blocked, it gets really confused.
Is there a way to tell ROS, don't use angle x to y on this sensor?
Should I just use a Kinect instead?

Thanks again mate

A:

In #q255110, LaserScanAngularBoundsFilter allows you to change the range start and stop.
The laser_filters package also includes LaserScanAngularBoundsFilterInPlace to remove an arbitrary chuck, instead of changing the start and stop angles.
Example usage:
