Q:

Can I provide a "Null" value for a xacro macro parameter?

I have a .urdf.xacro file where a particular xacro macro has been defined with a few parameters including - "mesh". When I instantiate this particular macro in another file, I wish to leave out the "mesh" parameter and instead define a shape (like a rectangular box) of my own.
Is this possible at all?

A:

The xacro converter seemed to be quite literally to me, but you could look at it's source.
Or you could remove mesh/shape from that macro and make two macros extending the base macro for both mesh and shape.
And mesh="" won't work?

I will look into the source, thanks! I tried mesh =" " but that didn't work because it searched for the ".stl" file (no name extension). I will check if modifying the xacro works or not. Thanks again!
