Q:

Message (ConstPtr) forwarding in ROS

Hello everyone,
I am developing an application with several nodes: one receives a message (for example: ImageConstPtr&) that will be forwarded to another node in particular (via another topic), following a pool of workers approach. Can I create a publisher that use its function publish() with that ConstPtr& message, or should I transfer its contents to a new message object?
Thank you in advance

A:

Short version:
Yes, you can pass that ConstPtr to a call to publish(), and it will work.
Long answer: Can you explain the problem you're trying to solve in a bit more detail? I'm envisioning a sort of round-robin message dispatch, and that seems painful.
