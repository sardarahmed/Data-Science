Q:

where is the rosbuild_add_roslaunch_check script?

I am using rosbuild_add_roslaunch_check() to check the launch files in a package. It fails with this message on Electric:
/bin/sh: /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/tools/rostest/scripts/roslaunch-check.py: not found

There is a similar message on Fuerte. There is no test output, but the messages appear to have worked:
SUMMARY
 * RESULT: SUCCESS
 * TESTS: 0
 * ERRORS: 0
 * FAILURES: 0

I suppose there is some package I should have installed, but can't seem to find it. What do I need to install for this to work correctly?

A:

Looks like the roslaunch-check.py script moved from scripts/ to bin/, but the CMake still looks in the wrong place.
I opened a defect ticket: #3865.
