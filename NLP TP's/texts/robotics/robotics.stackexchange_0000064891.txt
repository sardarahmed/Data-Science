build 3d environment

Does any know how to build a 3d environment map?
for example : if i want to build my office's 3d environment "map" and use it in gazebo , put my robot in it and simulate, just like the things willow garage do. are there some tool to do this work or i should learn opengl?
thx~

opengl is definitely not the right direction to go in. You may want to look at the gazebo world editor.
