Q:

velodyne_driver: will you provide a model for the VLP-16?

Currently the velodyne_driver package supports only the HDL-32 and 64. Will you provide a model for the VLP-16 soon?

A:

I would like to, but I don't have access to that device, so I will need significant help from someone who does.
There is already a patch at the driver level, submitted by Brice Rebsamen. But, it does not include the additional point cloud conversions that are apparently needed.
See: https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/pull/38

The current source master now supports the VLP-16. An Indigo release is planned.

The VLP-16 support was contributed by Patrick Hussey, with help from several others. It will be released soon, I hope.
