Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS fuerte sdf

Hi everybody,
I'm trying to switch between ROS electric and ROS fuerte. My problem is in launching the '.launch' file since the shell says that my model is deprecated (originally it was a '.xacro' file).
Does anybody know how to convert it into a new ROS format without rewriting by scratch my model?
Thank you,
Neostek
P.S. I also tried with the 'gzsdf' command following this guide
http://answers.ros.org/question/41766/gazebo-urdf-deprecated/
The real problem is the model misses some parts and the warning message
Warning [parser.cc:348] Gazebo SDF has no gazebo element
Warning [parser.cc:291] DEPRECATED GAZEBO MODEL FILE
On July 1st, 2012, this formate will no longer by supported
continues to appear

A:

If the message you're seeing is a warning, check out this post
Otherwise, the way to convert from URDF to SDF is a 3 step process.
First, convert the xacro to an urdf using rosrun xacro xacro.py.
Then, from here,
rosrun gazebo urdf2model -f you_model.urdf -o old_gazebo_format.xml
roscd gazebo
source setup.bash
./gazebo/bin/gzsdf print old_gazebo_format.xml > your_model.sdf
