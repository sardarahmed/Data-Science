Q:

Problem with nxt_lejos installation on ROS Hydro

I'm trying to install nxt_lejos on ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Hydro following the official ROS documentation and by also referring to some answers found on forums. I've followed these steps:

successfully installed rosjava following this
tutorial
with several corrections from this
forum
(obviously changing all the references to ROS version to hydro-devel)

successfully installed lejos as prescribed the official tutorial from lejos.org website

trying to install nxt_lejos following this tutorial (section 1.2)

once launching shell command 'gradle installApp' I get the following error:
20:12:25.603 [ERROR] [org.gradle.BuildExceptionReporter] FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
20:12:25.606 [ERROR] [org.gradle.BuildExceptionReporter]

20:12:25.654 [ERROR] [org.gradle.BuildExceptionReporter]       ros.nxt_lejos:nxt_lejos_lcp_proxy:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT
based on what I have read so far on this  forum
it looks like the ros.rosjava_core:rosjava:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT artifact has been removed and the robotbrains repository closed;
so I have tried to modify the build.gradle file in each project included in nxt_lejos accordingly to use a newer version of the artifact (org.ros.rosjava_core:rosjava:0.1.+) and a new repository but I'm still getting a similar error (the same error as above with just a different missing artifact)
How can I install nxt_lejos avoiding these errors?
Thanks in advance

A:

If the repository has indeed been closed, then there will be no later versions here... I do not know this for a fact, so I cannot post an answer. Perhaps get in touch with the maintainers.
