Q:

Kinect on Jetson TK1

I cannot get Kinect (PC edition) to be detected with ROS (indigo) freenect_launch.
Ubuntu (using grinch kernel) packaged freenect_glview does give me Kinect image and depth information, ROS glview does not find device.
Bus 002 Device 009: ID 045e:02bf Microsoft Corp.
Bus 002 Device 008: ID 045e:02be Microsoft Corp.
Bus 002 Device 005: ID 045e:02c2 Microsoft Corp.

Thanks for hints.

A:

It looks like the version of libfreenect that is included in ROS is currently too old to support the Kinect4Windows.
There is an open ticket about this.

Thanks for reply !
Unfortunately neither of these worked for me, but if I understand correctly, Kinect does work for you in the Jetson ?
I'm wondering if the USB id values do not match "expectations" of the library coming with ROS ? What Kinect edition / USB ID values do you use / see ?
Thanks again

Yes, I have an original Kinect.

If the note regarding freenect version and recommendation for bugtracker ticket was pulled out, I believe I can give that the "correct answer" mark.
I believe this can added as bugtracker link: Ticket
