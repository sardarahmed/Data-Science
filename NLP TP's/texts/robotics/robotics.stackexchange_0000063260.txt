Q:

unable to locate package ros-hydro-turtlebot

I'm following the turtlebot turtorial but when I attempt to install the deb packages required, I get the apt-get error message "Unable to locate package".
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-turtlebot ros-hydro-turtlebot-apps ros-hydro-turtlebot-viz ros-hydro-turtlebot-simulator ros-hydro-kobuki-ftdi
Reading package lists... Done

E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-turtlebot-viz
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-turtlebot-simulator
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-kobuki-ftdi

I'm on Ubuntu 13.10 with ros-hydro-desktop-full installed from sources. I have the deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/ saucy main repository in my sources.list which I've already updated.
What haven't I done?  Would this have something to do with the fact that I've installed from sources?
Cheers,
Nap

A:

The turtlebot tutorial explicitly states that you should install desktop-full from debs.
In particular, it depends on having the ROS deb repository set up and desktop-full installed from debs.

Didn't read down the page far enough before I asked. ;)
