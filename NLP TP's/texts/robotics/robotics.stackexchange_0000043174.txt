A:

I think it is somewhere in the lens. I'd recommend transforming the data to some better usable frame like the kinect link.

The origin should be somewhere near the lens or actually in the camera. Usually you want distances  relative to something you, so I'd recommend using a frame like the kinect's base frame. It depends on what you want to do with the data.
