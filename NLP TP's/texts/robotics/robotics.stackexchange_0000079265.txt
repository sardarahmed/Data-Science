Q:

Can a Sabertooth 2x25 Motor Controller be used with ROS?

I have a sabertooth 2x25 motor controller that I was planning on using for me "real world robot." Does it have to be connected through an arduino or Pi? If so does anyone have an example or a link to a tutorial?

A:

You need some kind of microcontroller that is supported by ROS,  Arduino and Raspberry Pi are. For Arduino, take a look at the rosserial_arduino tutorials.
