Q:

Question about roboearth network

Hello,
I have a small question about using roboearth with ROS. I want to use the roboearth with turtlebot kinect for object detection.
My question is

Do you need the robot laptop and workstation to be connected to internet in order to use the roboearth features?
I am using the workstation pc and robot pc without internet, I just network them using usb routers.

As it says, you need to have an account on the roboearth to save your data and then calling it back for detection, can this be done without internet connection?

Thanks

A:

If you want to exchange data with the RoboEarth database via the Internet, you will need to have an Internet connection. Not sure if you can use the object recording software without connection and store the objects locally -- if that's not described in the documentation, how about trying out if there is a button for that?
