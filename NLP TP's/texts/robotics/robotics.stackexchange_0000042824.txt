Q:

How can I use the Create of the Turtlebot on the serial port?

I have a custom built Turtlebot with an iRobot Create. However I do not have a serial to USB adapter.
How can I use the serial cable of the Create for my Turtlebot? I already found out that in turtlebot_node.py the port for the Create is set to ttyUSB0. What do I have to change here, so that I can use the serial port? Do I have to change anything else?

A:

You can set your serial port path in launch file:
<launch>
      <node pkg="turtlebot_node" type="turtlebot_node.py" name="turtlebot_node" output="screen" respawn="true" args="--respawnable">
        <param name="bonus" value="false" />
        <param name="update_rate" value="30.0" />
        <param name="port" value="/dev/ttyS0" />
        <param name="publish_tf" value="true" />
      </node>
</launch>
