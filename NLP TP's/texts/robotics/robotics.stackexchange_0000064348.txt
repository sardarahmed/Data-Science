A:

hi @ksmksam, for connecting ROS with Usarsim you need a usarsim_inf package which acts as an interface between ROS and USARsim you can download it from Git Repository, this repository has a stack named ros-usarsim which has many package along with usarsim_inf, download it and make it via rosmake command, then use it to connect with usarsim, to see the step by step procedure how to connect ROS with Usarsim using usarsim_inf Check our blog.
Hope this will work.
