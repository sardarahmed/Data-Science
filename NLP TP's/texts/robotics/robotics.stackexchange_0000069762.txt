Q:

Problems with catkin_make

I am having problems with each time that I try to run catkin_make.  Here is a copy of what I get:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package cmake_modules.

  Set cmake_modules_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
  file for cmake_modules.  The file will have one of the following names:

    cmake_modulesConfig.cmake
    cmake_modules-config.cmake

I have tried looking for the cmake_modules_DIR, but so far no luck.
Thank You!

When I run the command, I get: Unable to locate package ros-hydro/indigo.

You need to put in your ROS version only.

In your case is
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-cmake-modules

I still get the same CMake Error: Could not find a configuration file for package cmake_modules.

I found the problem, I had a package that was causing the problem.  I removed the package, and now catkin_make works fine.  Thanks to all for your help.

Hi, which package did you remove to fix the issue? I have the same problem.

On kinetic, Mago Nick's comment worked for me.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-cmake-modules
