Q:

3d particle filter based slam

Hi guys ,
I am aware of 2d slam using AMCL . Where 2d laser scans are compared with a global cost map to restimate the location .
I was wondering if there might be  any algorithm out there which can do the following .

First build a highly dense Point Cloud Map using a 3D lidar such as VLP16 .(I used this , https://github.com/ningwang1028/lidar_slam_3d)
Then using the above generated  map , use depth output from Stereo/Depth camera  to perform a 3d particle filter to re-estimate the location

If anyone has some pointers kindly share .

A:

Sure, doesn't sound too hard, it would be the exact same process as AMCL just with a different projection model of the rays. All the algorithms you just mentioned you gave examples of existing, its just plugging them together to make your application.
