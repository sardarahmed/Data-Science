Q:

C++ bindings for python in ros 2

Since boost is no longer used in ROS 2 , what will be the preferred method for binding C++ code with python ? In ROS 1, we were using boost/python.hpp, what is the suitable option in ROS 2.0 ?

I don't believe there currently is a default/recommended library or framework for Python binding with ROS 2, but I've seen people use pybind/pybind11.

A:

Even though the core ROS2 libraries no longer use boost, you're free to use it in your own packages.
It looks like rclpy (the ROS2 Python client library) is using the cPython API: https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/tree/master/rclpy/src/rclpy , so that may be another alternative for you.
