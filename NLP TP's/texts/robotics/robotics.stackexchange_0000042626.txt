Q:

rpath issues in manifest.xml:

Hi,
I came across with problem when I tried to install segway_rmp under the instructions http://www.ros.org/wiki/segway_rmp,
but it displays:
ERROR The following packages have rpath issues in manifest.xml:

segway_rmp_demos: found flag "-L/opt/ros/fuerte/lib", but no matching "-Wl,-rpath,/opt/ros/fuerte/lib"
segway_rmpX: found flag "-L/opt/ros/fuerte/lib", but no matching "-Wl,-rpath,/opt/ros/fuerte/lib"
joy2twist_segway_rmp: found flag "-L/opt/ros/fuerte/lib", but no matching "-Wl,-rpath,/opt/ros/fuerte/lib"

Thank you for your help!
