Q:

Error: stack/package not found

Hello, I have just added a new package to my workspace, but ROS can not see the package and give the error :
I know I have to source it, but I just do not know how... Error: stack/package not found#
Please do not refer me ROS tutorial page, especially the first or third tutorial :) I do not ask here before trying ros tutorials page or internet in the end :)
I need a step by step answer, not something go that tutorial or look that page.
Thanks
