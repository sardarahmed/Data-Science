Q:

Explore subscribed topics

Hello !
I'm currently investigating deeper into explore node as it drives (in simulation) my PR2 to discover his environment. When running the node and looking at rxgraph, I noticed that the subscribed topics differs from the ones listed in the [documentation]{http://www.ros.org/wiki/explore}.
The running node subscribes to :

/move_base/result
/move_base/feedback
/move_base/status
/tf

whereas none are written on ros.org.
Is that because of a node update and what are they used for ?
Thanks for answering.

A:

1-3 are the result of an action interface (more information about actionlib).
4 is the result of a tf listener.
All of the above are features of ROS that use topics to communicate, but don't require explicitly creating publishers or subscribers, and are not considered part of a node's topic API.
