Q:

Displaying results of image filters

I would like a way to display images and results of several image filters and data extracted from images in a interactive GUI. The GUI would need to display at least 6 panels, some of which would be 2 or 3 dimensional plots, and then a couple panels to show results of image filters. One of the plots should also be interactive, allowing for a data point selection tool.
Finally, I would want displaying this data to be integrated with ROS. For example, one of the panels should show the result of listening to a topic that is publishing sensor_msgs/Image. Other panels that show filtered images should show the data being published by my ROS nodes or the results of calling my ROS services.
I'm a little new to python, C++, and ROS, so I apologize for my ignorance. Is there a tool or set of tools that can help me do this?

A:

You can do all the image processing with ROS using CV_Bridge, and rxplot for the graphs.

of course you can find a lot of online image sdk that is able to display image the data and the   image filters vb.net. change a few lines then they will be able to integrate with ROS. "image filters vb.net. change a few lines then they will be able to integrate with ROS.
