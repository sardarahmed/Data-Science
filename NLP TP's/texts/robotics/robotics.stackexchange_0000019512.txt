Q:

Is there a straightforward 16bit microcontroller?

Background 
Some of my sketches or ideas require a common data buss to all perph chips. 
The issue 
This way issue still lays before me, how then, if I am going for a common data buss. how do I address each chip via this microcontroller? 
However, Using a microprocessor is a plus in that direction, but i rather not design something that takes more chips when i can  just handle with one central chip to work out the calculations and decisions.  
Main idea 
My question is. What is a good microcontroller that offers me 

16 bit parallel ports. 
easy adressing to perph chips
able to handle a wide variety of brands.

Documents and data sheets that are related 
Here are some related documents that I intended to use.

8bit Atmel Atmega640 microcontroller 
HS cmos ARING bus interface 16bit 
AD5207 2 channel 256 position digital potentiometer 
RIRWE416D4 series 4M high speed SRAM 256kbit Ã— 16 bit 

Finding a good microcontroller will be a step into finding a good 16 ADC. 
Why this question 
The intersil 80cxx platform is cringe worthy in my view because, the address and the data is share a common pin set and I need extra hardware to demux the data and the address. Also,  the platform they give is byte oriented I need word. 
Replacement requirements.
I need something that gives me good high speed performance that I can use in a microcomputer esk layout. 
My number one priority is finding something that is highly customizable with the requirement that I can use the standard 15 pin serial com ports or at least 
The parallax propellor 8 core is close could go down to two core. 

A:

The propeller core is flexible to allow 16 bit ports and SPI, I2C or any data buss nterfacing protocol. Without the need for interrupts.
