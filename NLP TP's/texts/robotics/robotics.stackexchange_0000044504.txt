Q:

Network connection b/w two pc for turtlebot?

Dear All,
Can I use the ad-hoc network to connect between the turtlebot laptop and workstation laptop both having wifi capability. Since I want to map a large area, I dont want to connect to a static wifi router, rather have flexibility to carry the workstation laptop to further distance where turtlebot goes.
Will I be able to ssh between two laptops by ad-hoc network connection?
Or can you suggest any alternative. In short I dont want to use the router for flexibility.
Thanks

A:

Yes you can very well use the ad-hoc connection between the workstation and the TurtleBot laptop. You will be able to ssh too, No problem! I have used the ad-hoc connection and it worked well.
