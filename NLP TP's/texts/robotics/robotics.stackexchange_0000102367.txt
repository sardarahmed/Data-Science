Q:

Where are the gazebo_ros plugin source code

I am trying to find the .cc for the gazebo _ros plugins for ros2.
For example : I can open gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world and work with it,  but it would be nice to see how the plugin was written. I want to modify the .cc plugin file instead of having to write it from scratch.
