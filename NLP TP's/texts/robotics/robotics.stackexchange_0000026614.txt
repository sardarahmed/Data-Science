Q:

Is it possible to get the contact point of a laser sensor?

Hi,
is there a simple solution for getting the coordinates on which the rays of a sensor hit a target?
At the moment I calculate the points myself by using the sensor pose, the start and end angles and the samples, but I think there has to be an easier way to do that...

A:

That's the easiest way. Gazebo mimics the output from laser range finders, which is typically angle and range readings.
