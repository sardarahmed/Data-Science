Q:

cannot launch node of type interactive_marker_twist_server

I am using ROS-Kinetic under Ubuntu 16.06. I am constantly seeing this error in my screen.
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [interactive_marker_twist_server/marker_server]: interactive_marker_twist_server

I have gone through this Link and it shows this package is available for indigo and jade only. I tried but it does not work with Kinetic. I don't want to develop my expertise for indigo. Please, help. Thanks in advance

A:

If a package is not available for a particular ROS release, you can always try to build from source.
For interactive_marker_twist_server specifically (but the process is the same for others):
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-visualization/interactive_marker_twist_server.git
rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

Provided that all dependencies of the package are available (rosdep succeeds) and compilation was successful, you should now be able to use the package.

I don't want to develop my expertise for indigo.

There really isn't that much difference (anymore) between ROS versions, so you should be fine on either.

It appears that this package is now available for Kinetic. I did sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-interactive-marker-twist-server and it installed without issue.
