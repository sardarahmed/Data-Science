I'm aware with the fact that some of these are an error with catkin_make, but the common theme is that there is a conflict between Anaconda and the default Python path. You should try setting the default interpreter as your interpreter (2.7) instead of using Anaconda's.

Thank you for your help. I removed Anaconda completely, and it works fine now.
