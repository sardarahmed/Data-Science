Q:

Couldn't find executable named jet_real.launch below /home/nvidia/FOLDER_FOR_ROS/catkin_ws/src/rosjet/jet_bringup [rosrun]

Hello everyone sorry for this long question I am pretty new with ROS, I am trying to connect my jetson TX! with my host pc. However when I run my launch file
source ~/.bashrc; source FOLDER_FOR_ROS/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh; rosrun jet_bringup jet_real.launch

I get this error:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named jet_real.launch below /home/nvidia/FOLDER_FOR_ROS/catkin_ws/src/rosjet/jet_bringup
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/nvidia/FOLDER_FOR_ROS/catkin_ws/src/rosjet/jet_bringup/launch/jet_real.launch

when I run catkin config I get this:

I already check my jetson and Pc can ping, but I think that this problem come from directories path
I will really appreciate your help thanks

A:

You're using
rosrun jet_bringup jet_real.launch

to start a launch file. rosrun expects an executable, which a launch file isn't. Take a look at the error
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named jet_real.launch below /home/nvidia/FOLDER_FOR_ROS/catkin_ws/src/rosjet/jet_bringup

You need to use roslaunch instead
roslaunch jet_bringup jet_real.launch
