Q:

Issues with the heighmap

We are having couple of issues with the heightmap modelling.!
a) Using an attached grayscale image (image description) Gazebo generates some inexplicable peaks in one of the corners (image description).  Always in the same corner, independent of how I draw the texture. We are using an attached model.sdf C:\fakepath\model.sdf file from the tutorial to include the heightmap.
b) Images resolution including 33x33 and less cause Gazebo to segfault upon starting it.
c) When including very large heightmaps (e.g. 48 48 0.5) Gazebo becomes super slow (e.g. 0.01 real time). Is this a known behaviour?
d) is it possible to get rid of the extrusion of the heightmap-based model under the ground plane? See attached pic to see what I mean. image description
We are on the 1.5  version, catkin_groovy branch: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/6c1ec8a7598efa8574b908522386eb13d9d8427f/?at=catkin_groovy.

same problem here, with 1.5 as well.
Also tried 1.8.6, and in that case it crashes.
Both versions are 32bit, by the way.

A:

I'm transitioning this to a gazebo issue.
