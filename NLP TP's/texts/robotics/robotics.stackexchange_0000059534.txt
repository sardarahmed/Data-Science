Q:

May I use ROS this way?

I am new to ROS.  I have a robot, which collects data through its sensor. And I have a laptop with ROS residing on Ubuntu. I may want to send the sensor data to the laptop through a router. Is there anyway to implement this. The robot does not have ROS on it. It has a tailored Fedora on it.
Many thanks
Yoshi
