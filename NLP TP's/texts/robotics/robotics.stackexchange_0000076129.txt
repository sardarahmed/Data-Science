Q:

roslaunch remote pc

There are two PCs named tzh-pdl and alienware and they can ssh to each other successfully.
tzh@tzh-pdl:~$ ssh allen@alienware 
Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-21-generic x86_64)

Last login: Mon Sep  5 22:13:30 2016 from 10.0.5.47
allen@alienware:~$ 

There is my launch file.
<launch>
   <machine name="wrsb" address="alienware" env-loader="/opt/ros/kinetic/env.sh" user="allen"/>
   <node machine="wrsb" name="listener" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="listener.py"/>
   <node machine="wrsb" name="talker" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="talker.py"/>
</launch>

I want to launch the node in alienware pc through roslaunch the launch file in tzh-pdl pc.But I got the problem.
tzh@tzh-pdl:~$ roslaunch catkin_ws/test.launch

A:

I fix it through use ssh without known_hosts.
In other words, set the Environment value ROSLAUNCH_SSH_UNKNOWN=1
