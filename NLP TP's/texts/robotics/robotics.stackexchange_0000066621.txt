Q:

caterpillar belt in gazebo

Hi everyone !
I am trying to build a model in Gazebo which has caterpillar tracks like in tanks. Can you please suggest me how to do that in Gazebo ? The tracks are somewhat similar to the picture in this link : http://www.irobot.com/gi/images/research/lightbox/473.jpg

A:

Looking around quickly I have found this tracksdriveplugin which seems to be a Gazebo plugin for tracks like you want. A good keyword when searching is "non rigid body".
Here is a related post  Simulating a track driven robot
Not an exact solution, but at least some pointers.
