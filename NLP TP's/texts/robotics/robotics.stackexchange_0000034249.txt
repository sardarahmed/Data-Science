Q:

rosserial - lost sync with device (arduino)

Hi everyone,
I am experiencing some issues whith the rosserial_arduino tutorial "hello world" example.
I am working on a ASUS eee PC with the latest ubuntu version (11.04) and a ROS release I installed during july 2011.
After installing the rosserial stack as described in the tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup),
I was able to upload the "hello world" sketch into my arduino duemilanove.
Following the "hello world (example publisher)" page (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World),
the issue appears in the terminal where I run the 'rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0' command :
me:$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0
[INFO] [WallTime:1315932634.660507] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime:1315932634.673866] Connected on /dev/ttyUSB0 at 57600 baud
[ERROR] [WallTime:1315932664.690539] Lost sync with device, restarting...
...
...
Also as expected, when I try to listen to the topic with 'rostopic echo chatter', I have this warning message :
WARNING: topic [/chatter] does not appear to be published yet
I was able to run a sketch with an IR sensor on the arduino in a standalone mode, so the communication between the computer and the arduino seems fine.
Did anyone already experience this 'sync' issue ?
Is there any other way of checking the synchronisation between the arduino and ROS ?
Thanks a lot for anyhelp :)

Thanks a lot, following your advice I tried with an atmega 2560 I had and the sync problem disapeared right away.

Does your arduino duemilanove have a atmega168 or atmega328?  If it is a 168, it is probably running out of memory.  If so, check out this answer: http://answers.ros.org/question/2120/problem-setting-up-rosserial_arduino

A:

It looks like it was an out of memory error from comments above.
