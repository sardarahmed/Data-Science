Q:

Frames and rviz visualization

I have the following frame transformation chain:
laser_frame -> base_link -> base_stabilized -> base_footprint -> odom -> map -> world
Where

laser_frame is where the scans are
generated
odom is the odometry regarding the
map
map is where the 2D map is created
based on scans
world is the frame in the middle of
the stage, what is meant to be
(0,0,0) and the very first coordinate
axis

I want the map to be created over the world while scans/world/map moving regarding the quadrotor. I mean something intuitive, the quadrotor moves inside the stage so rviz must show how the stage (world, scans and map) move relative to it, keeping it in the center of view, fixed.
What must be the fixed frame? What must be the target frame? Why? Must I do some weird transformation or it's just simply the setup?

A:

The answer to this question is not simple.
It depends on how you want your frames and what transforms are you doing and how are you doing them.
Each case will require different solutions.
I recomend to make a draw about your frames and reference axes, what you want, what you have and asking yourself if the transformations  you are doing have any sense by themselves.
