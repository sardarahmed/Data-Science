Q:

How to use your custom map for turtlebot navigation in simulation?

Hello all,
I have built a custom map of my building and I want to use it in simulation (Rviz) to test my code. In simple words, I want some like turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch with my map and without a stage.
I am trying to do it, but I am getting a lot of error. This is another question I have posted regarding the error I am facing when I launched my custom launch file.
This is my launch file
<launch>
<arg name="base"       value="$(optenv TURTLEBOT_BASE kobuki)"/>  <!-- create, rhoomba -->
  <arg name="stacks"     value="$(optenv TURTLEBOT_STACKS hexagons)"/>  <!-- circles, hexagons -->
  <arg name="3d_sensor"  value="$(optenv TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR kinect)"/>  <!-- kinect, asus_xtion_pro -->
  
  <include file="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/includes/robot.launch.xml">
    <arg name="base" value="$(arg base)" />
    <arg name="stacks" value="$(arg stacks)" />
    <arg name="3d_sensor" value="$(arg 3d_sensor)" />
  </include>
  
  <node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher">
    <param name="use_gui" value="true"/>
  </node>
  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_footprint_to_map" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 /map /base_footprint 100"/>
  
  <node name="rviz1" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="-d $(find turtlebot_rviz_launchers)/rviz/navigation.rviz"/>
</launch>

also I am running a map with map_server node and amcl using rosrun amcl amcl
In the terminal where I ran amcl node i get an error saying that no messages revieced on /scan topic. So, I am not sure how to publish a simulated /scan messages.
Does anyone used a custom map in simulation ( I am sure a lot of people did it). If yes, can you please help me?
Thanks,
Sai Krishna Allani

A:

I am also doing a similar thing with my irobot create 2 robot.
Were you able to successfully upload your map onto RVIZ( using a .yaml file) ? I am having a similar problem as well.
Please see attached my amcl.launch file for info.
See  link text  for info.
