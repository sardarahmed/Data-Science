Hello,
I am having the same problem. Any ideas? Even wild guesses are welcome :)

did you find an answer?

A:

Yes, to compile the "ethzasl_icp_mapping" library in "ROS indigo" under "Ubuntu 14.04"
it is necessary do the following in catkin_ws / src :
1- git clone -b indigo_devel https://github.com/ethz-asl/ethzasl_icp_mapping.git
2- git clone -b release/indigo/libnabo https://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo-release.git
3- git clone -b release/indigo/libpointmatcher https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher-release.git

4- in catkin_ws execute: catkin_make_isolated
5- in catkin_ws / devel_isolated execute:  source setup.bash

is there any alternative to make it work without isolation? I am not used to work with that.
Or could you tell me where is a tutorial or something like that to set my mind in order?
Thanks for your answer!!!
