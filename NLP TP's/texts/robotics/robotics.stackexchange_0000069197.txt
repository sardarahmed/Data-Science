I already checked the CMakeLists.txt with:
https://github.com/sdmiller/pcl/commit/1f3732771ff0aceaaaeff9ebbb81baf2c8fd2db8
Now I not sure where went wrong.
Thanks for any help!

A:

Hi guys! I solved the problem.
If anybody of you encounter this problem on Groovy (I can't confirm for other version, although you can try), you don't have to catkin_make octomap_mapping package.
Follow the 1.1 Installation @
http://wiki.ros.org/octomap_mapping
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-octomap ros-groovy-octomap-mapping

Make sure your environment setup is correct as stated in tutorial.
And run
rosdep install octomap_mapping
rosmake octomap_mapping

With that, octomap and its dependencies are installed.
To navigate and run, just
roscd octomap_server

and
ls

The launch/src folders are all there.
