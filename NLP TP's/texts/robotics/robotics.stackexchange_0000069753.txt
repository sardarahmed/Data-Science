Q:

Adding a standard msg within the custom msg

Hi!
I've made my custom message following the tutorial here.
It works fine. What i want to do is to include some information in my message, as a twist.msg, for instance.
How can I declare this on my .msg file?
Something like this? :

geometry_msgs/Twist Base
geometry_msgs/Quaternion Turret
uint8  battery

would this work when catkin making all the custom messages?
Thanks in advance.

A:

That is the correct way to define the message defintion. In addition:

Make sure you add proper dependencies to geometry_msgs  and std_msgs in your package's package.xml and your CMakeLists.txt files.

You need to also add those dependencies to generate_messages macro in package's CMakeLists.txt:

generate_messages(
  DEPENDENCIES
  std_msgs
  geometry_msgs
)
