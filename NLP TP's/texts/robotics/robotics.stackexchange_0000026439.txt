Q:

Ubuntu 13.04 - Raring Ringtail support

Dear Gazebo developers,
Really nice to see a PPA, will Ubuntu 13.10 be supported soon too?
http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu/dists/
Personally I had no problems whatsoever in upgrading everything I maintain for 13.10, there are almost no changes compared to 12.10. So, I assume it's just a few minutes of the time of your package maintainer.
Kind regards,
Anne

You say 13.04 in the title but 13.10 in the post. I assume you mean 13.04 in both cases?

A:

Gazebo 1.10 (coming out on Oct. 4th, 2013) will have support for raring.
