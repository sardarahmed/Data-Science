A:

You should be able to make an SDF model file that contains the camera plugin and then drag that model into your gazebo world.  If you need the camera higher than the ground plane, you should be able to define the pose in the SDF file.
Actually, here is a Gazebo tutorial that walks you through creating a camera model and adding it to your world.
