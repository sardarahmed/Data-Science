Towards the end of this tutorial , you would have learned about making a SLAM enabled robot using Gmapping . In that you will encounter inflation on Rviz .

not clear!

A:

Assuming that you are working with move_base... the inflation layer can be visualized in rviz as a costmap. Just add a map topic to rviz and select it to hear the costmap topic (i.e. /move_base/local_costmap/costmap). Then select "Color Scheme" -> costmap, the result will be the same as the picture you have pointed out in your comment.
