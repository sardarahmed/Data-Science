Q:

How to publish topics at specific rate?(Python)

I have 5 topics publishing images at different rates. I want them to publish at the same rate and hence I am trying to set the rostopic hz to a constant rate for all the 5 topics. How can I do it in rospy?
My understanding is that rospy.Rate() will work only for that loop of code. How can I set the rate a which the messages are being published?
Thanks

A:

This needs to be done/handled in the node actually sending the messages. Either they provide a possibility to set the rate, or not. Typcially, for most sensors (cameras, laser scanners, ...), they don't. You will get your messages as fast as possible.
If you want, you could, however, push all those topics through a topic_tools throttle.
See the ROS wiki on the syntax.
