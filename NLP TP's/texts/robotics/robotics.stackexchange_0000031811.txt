Q:

rviz: OGRE EXCEPTION(3:RenderingAPIException): Unable to create a suitable GLXContext in GLXContext

When i try to run "rosrun rviz rviz" i get this output :
[ INFO] [1306327198.635135186]: Loading general config from [/home/rajat/.rviz/config]
[ INFO] [1306327198.650256875]: Loading display config from [/home/rajat/.rviz/display_config]
[ERROR] [1306327199.295138649]: Caught exception while loading: OGRE EXCEPTION(3:RenderingAPIException): Unable to create a suitable GLXContext in GLXContext::GLXContext at /tmp/buildd/ros-diamondback-visualization-common-1.4.0/debian/ros-diamondback-visualization-common/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-1/RenderSystems/GL/src/GLX/OgreGLXContext.cpp (line 61)

A:

I got it working , i guess this is some issue with the video card drive . i was using ubnutu in a virtual machine inside windows , but now i installed it as a separate operating system along with the windows , and installed everything again . and everything seems to work fine now :).
i know this is not the solution , but if you have the same case give this method a try .

Actually it is the solution. 3D and virtual machines don't work well together and rviz/OGRE makes heavy use of 3D features.
