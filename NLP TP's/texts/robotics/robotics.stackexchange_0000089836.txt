Q:

Can edit map in Rviz?

Hi all, I want to edit a saved map in rviz, for example: add a line or erase some noise points. Can anyone have some idea?

A:

You cannot use rviz to edit saved maps, but you can edit the pgm files in Gimp, Pinta or another image editor.

Thx for reply. Should this function(map editor) can be implemented by building a new plugins of rviz?I now try to make it in rviz.Can you give me some advice?

You might be able to do it, but you will probably have a hard time.

The interactive elements of Rviz are not good for image editing, so you will probably have to work hard to make a good user interface.

The ROS nodes which can publish the map (gmapping, map_server and others) are not designed to receive updates, so you will need to come up with a different way to publish and save the updated map.
