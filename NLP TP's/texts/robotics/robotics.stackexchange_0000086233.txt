Q:

Can i install ROS2 on the same machine which alrerady has ROS installed?

I worked with ROS for a couple of weeks and now need to upgrade to ROS2 due to its DDS feature. Although i know that ROS2 offers a bridge for ROS1 but just to be sure i want to ask if i can install ROS2 on the same machine as ROS or shall i create another VM to install ROS2 seperately ?

Yes.
If you're using Ubuntu Xenial as your OS you could even use the provided binaries (Installing ROS2 via Debian Packages).

And what if i want to do it the other way round ? i.e. I installed ROS2 first (from source) and then I want to use to features of ROS using the ROS bridge. Is it then possible ? As now i dont have any ROS installed.

Provided you are using an OS that is supported by ROS1 it should be possible.
