A:

Easiest way is to add the IR frame position to your URDF robot description. Assuming you are already publishing the robot state, that should add the TF for the IR sensor automatically. You'll also have to write a node to read the analog values from the IR sensor and convert to a distance, then publish that. It's probably easiest to make the IR sensor look like a laser scanner with only a single scan point. (Reason: some off-the-shelf ROS nodes will work with laser scan messages but not single distance reading messages. Sigh...)
