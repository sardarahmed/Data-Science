Q:

Failed to load plugin libgazebo...: libgazebo...: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

When running a command similar to the roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch of the Tutorial: Using roslaunch to start Gazebo, world files and URDF models, I get the following error:

[Err] [Plugin.hh:180] Failed to load plugin libgazebo[...]:
libgazebo[...]: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

How to solve this?

A:

Solution was to remove the catkin workspace and install it again.
Remove:
In your catkin workspace, usually your project folder, delete (or rename with suffix "_old" if you want to compare the not working catkin workspace later with the working catkin workspace):

build
devel
optionally src/CMakeLists.txt (I did that, not sure if it is really needed)

Source:
Removing catkin workspace
Afterwards, the fresh catkin_make -j8 (or whatever catkin command you use) in my catkin workspace in the Python base environment installed without errors and the roslaunch command ran through.
