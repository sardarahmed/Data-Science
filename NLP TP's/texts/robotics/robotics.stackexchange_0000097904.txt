Q:

export ROS_HOSTNAME, ROS_MASTER_URI configuration problem

Hello all,
I was trying all day to figure out why my cmd won't accept my arrow keys as input for the turtlesim example.
At first I though there was some configuration problem with the shell I use (zsh).
After experimenting a little I noticed that I need to export ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_MASTER_URI in all 3 tabs I need to run the turtlsime example. So in each tab I go like:

export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost --- export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 --- roscore
export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost --- export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 --- rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost --- export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 --- rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

Only then my cmd will accept my arrow keys as input and I will see the turtle moving. Any idea what I am doing wrong? Is there a way I can avoid this? Like run it once, even if I need to restart my PC?
Thank you

A:

I'm not sure why you need to set ROS_HOSTNAME to localhost, but to avoid having to set these environment variables manually, add them to whichever file your shell loads/parses/sources when you start/log into a new shell.

I would not expect that to be necessary for a single machine setup.
I would recommend you try running things without setting those variables, and then see whether things work. If things don't work without those variables, that would point to a potential issue with your network configuration.
