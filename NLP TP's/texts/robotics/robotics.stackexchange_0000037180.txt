Q:

How to use tf in more than one robot?

Hi!
I'm trying to do coperative things in between turtlebots. The thing is that first I need both robots in the same core, otherwise they can not interact. But when I put them under the same core I don't know how to solve the tf.
I've tried to push one tf to turtlebot1/tf and the other to turtlebot2/tf, but then I can not see the tf on rviz. Is it correct to do that or do I need a tf which contains all the robots? If i need this how can I start having a look at that to do it?
Thanks!

A:

try setting the tf_prefix rosparam in your launch file.

as a word of caution: having multiple robots on a single master consumes a lot of network bandwidth (especially if they share /tf!), you may run into seemingly strange issues as the result of dropped packets. If you try and scale beyond two robots without throttled topics over a standard 802.11g wifi connection you will definitely run into bandwidth constraints and may be forced to run a single master per robot and foreign relay between them.
