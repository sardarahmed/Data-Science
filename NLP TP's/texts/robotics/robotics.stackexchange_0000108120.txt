Q:

how to get information about goal of action

I learned to generate trajectories while working with ros2_controller.
I want to take a closer look, find the goal in /execute_trajectory/_action/
I can only check the message type below.
ros2 interface show moveit_msgs/action/ExecuteTrajectory 
I was able to understand the structure, but I don't know how it is used as an example.
I don't want anything custom. However, i want to use the existing message.
Because I need to know other messages, I wonder if the following is possible.
Is there a way to output /_action/goal as a topic?
Thank

A:

No, the hidden topic is the only way to see the action goal as a topic. But also, you shouldn't be looking at that. Its hidden for a reason so that you use the action client / server interfaces.
If you're just introspecting for debugging, then that's no problem to look at that topic once and again, but I just wouldn't rely on it as part of your application.
