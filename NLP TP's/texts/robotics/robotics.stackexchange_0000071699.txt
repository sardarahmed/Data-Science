Q:

Error when I open rviz

Hi! I have a question: when I launch a launch file to open rviz for hector slam, sometimes I have this message:
[rviz-4] process has died [pid 12780, exit code -11, cmd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/rviz/rviz -d rviz_cfg.rviz __name:=rviz __log:=/home/user/.ros/log/3deb1b84-c78d-11e5-8892-0c607639bb9d/rviz-4.log].
log file: /home/user/.ros/log/3deb1b84-c78d-11e5-8892-0c607639bb9d/rviz-4*.log

What can be the reason? Thank you!

A:

As described in this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/11064/list-of-possible-exit-codes-from-roslaunch/ ; exit code -11 indicates a segfault.
Segfaults are a pretty generic error, and there's no specific fix.
You might want to consult the rviz troubleshooting page: http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Troubleshooting or try running rviz in gdb.
