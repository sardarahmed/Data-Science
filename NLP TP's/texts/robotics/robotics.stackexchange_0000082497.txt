Q:

The size of image bytes array changed after published by ros in Android?

I have the problem in one of my ros-android project. In this project, I need to send the sensor messages type of compressed image which comes from the camera preview data to ros-server, however when I subscribed the topic to decode a bitmap from what I had published, I found the size of the image bytes array changed, it get bigger! And I had test this in other program environment, like C++ and C#, this problem never happened! I don't know why, and so confused about where I made a mistake that to caused this problem.
I had post my question in StackOverflow for help, however, it's helpless. So I have to ask the question again in here. You guys need to check for more details to visit the StackOverflow link. I really need your help!

It would be nice if you could clarify what the actual answer was, instead of linking to your SO question (which also only links to the API documentation).

I actually meant it would be nice if you could edit your answer here on ROS Answers. Not on StackOverflow.
