Q:

How to add a tool model onto the robot model which can be generated in the moveit

Hey guys,
I have downloaded the UR10 robot description(including the urdf and other components) in the ROS without a tool on the end effector. Now i have a mechanical mechanism which has been exported as a URDF in Solidworks. The problem is how can i add the mechanical mechanism as a tool on the robot end effector and open the entire model in the RVIZ? Do you have any tutorial about it?

do you just need to combine the URDF files? Your question makes it sound like you have a URDF of the UR10 and a URDF file of the end effector? Or do you just have the STL files from SW and need to create a URDF for the end effector?

Thanks for your reply. I have both URDF of UR10 and end effector. I want to combine them. Any suggestion?

A:

I typically use XACRO to combine arms and grippers.
for example:
<robot name="myrobot" xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">

<!-- myrobot urdf file -->
<xacro:include filename="$(find mypackage)/urdf/myrobotarm_no_end_effectors.urdf"/>

<!-- add any joints/links required to connect the two -->

<xacro:include filename="$(find mypackage)/urdf/an_end_effector.urdf.xacro" />

</robot>

I usually write the end effector as an xacro macro so that I can attach it to either a right or left arm or launch it standalone to trouble shoot the URDF file if need be.
Hope that helps.

@pdmike since you didn't accept, can I assume there's some aspect of this you're still having trouble with?

@andymcevoy your answer helped me a lot.
Although the base packages of the robots can be remained untouched, I still find it very inconvenient that you need to create a new moveit package for every single tool configuration of your endeffector.
I am wondering If there is a more elegant way to be a
