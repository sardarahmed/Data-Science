Q:

How to use launchfiles in Eclipse for debugging

I'd like to debug a particular node (openni_node) in Eclipse. To use that node normally one would call a launchfile like this: roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch, but this doesn't work on my computer at the moment (link).
Running roscore in terminal seems not to suffice to be able to then debug openni_node with Eclipse. Is there a way to use the same, aforementioned, launchfile in Eclipse in debug mode?

A:

You could launch the node in debug mode by adding the following line to the  tag in the launch file: launch-prefix="xterm -e gdb --args" (see this tutorial).  If you are not comfortable with a console based gdb you can use a front end interface like ddd.
You could configure Eclipse to use remote debugging, even if I think it's a long shot. You can find more instructions here.
