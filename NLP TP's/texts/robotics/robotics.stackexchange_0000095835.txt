Q:

3D LIDAR SLAM in 2020

Hi,
I have been using RTABMAP for SLAM with a stereo_camera, and it is working very well.  It seems well maitained by the activity on the github page.
Now I am looking to perform the same task with a 3D LIDAR, but I cannot find a package that seems to be maintained.
I checked: BLAM (last update 2016) and SegMatch (last update 2017).
Does anyone has a suggestion of a package that I can use?
I am using ROS Melodic , but I am willing to migrate to Noetic.

A:

Rtabmap can use 3D Lidar pretty ok. Cartographer, LegoLoam or hdl_graph_slam are maybe other options for you as they are a bit more up to date.

I've heard recommendations for HDL.

Thank you. Can I use a LIDAR standalone on Rtabmap? I though that I needed a stereo camera or a depth camera in parallel.
Comment by bob-ROS on 2020-05-13:
I updated my answer with the config I used for a OS1-16 channel LiDAR.
Comment by czr on 2020-05-25:
Thanks for your answer, I created a launch file based on your example, but I cannot get the /cloud_map and /cloud_ground topics. They get published but /cloud_ground yields an empty cloud while /cloud_map seems to have data, but nothing shows up in Rviz. I used the same RTAB-Map's parameters that I used for my stereo camera setup.

Hm, I dunno. Should probably ask a new question, I've never used the ground from rtabmap, only the 2D grid_map.
