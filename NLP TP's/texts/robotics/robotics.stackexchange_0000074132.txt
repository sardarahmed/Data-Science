Q:

How to use move_base with the DWA planner as the local planner in kinetic

Hello,
I am really confused as how to use the DWA for local planning with move_base.
It seems that dwa is now a bool parameter of the base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS. But then how to access the dw_local_planner parameters, such as forward_point_distance?

Problem solved!
I was getting errors while starting move_base with DWA in a classical way because i forgot to install the proper package:
 sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-dwa-local-planner 

Now everything is working well.
For reference i set the local planner as DWA by adding this line to my move_base.launch file:
<param name="base_local_planner" value="dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS"/>

I can then set the params with a *.yaml file:
DWAPlannerROS:
  max_vel_x: 0.4
  min_vel_x: 0.1

  max_trans_vel: 0.4
  min_trans_vel: 0.1
  
  etc....

Sorry for shooting to fast. But to be fair the documentation of the navigation stack is not very clear on this point...
