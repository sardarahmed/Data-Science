Q:

cannot locate node joy

Using Hydro on Precise. Following the tutorials on joystick operation here and here. The joystick works, roscore is running, joy_node is running, when I do rostopic echo joy I see the vectors change as I expect when the joystick controls are moved. When I run roslaunch learning_joy turtle_joy.launch however, the joystick still works, topic echo shows still sending, but no movement of the turtle. The error message is as follows:
roslaunch learning_joy turtle_joy.launch

A search of ROS answers (unless I missed something) yields nothing that I haven't already tried. Any ideas?

A:

It must be of type "joy_node" not "joy".
I mean in ur launch file
u have
<!-- joy node -->

<node respawn="true" pkg="joy"
        type="joy" name="turtle_joy" >
    <param name="dev" type="string" value="/dev/input/js0" />
    <param name="deadzone" value="0.12" />
  </node>

It must be
<!-- joy node -->
  <node respawn="true" pkg="joy"
        type="joy_node" name="turtle_joy" >
    <param name="dev" type="string" value="/dev/input/js0" />
    <param name="deadzone" value="0.12" />
  </node>

No joy. Changed joy to joy_node, still exactly the same problem.

The error is it exactly the same??
Comment by richkappler on 2014-06-08:
see above, just added the new screenshot, should I have made that a comment?

Actually, now that you mention it, it now finds joy, but still can't launch turtle_teleop_joy. I had posted the error here, but figured I'd better start a new thread as your fix did indeed correct the subject line problem.. Thanks for the help!
