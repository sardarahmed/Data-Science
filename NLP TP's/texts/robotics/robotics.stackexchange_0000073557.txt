Q:

Dose the rviz View-Oriented Text support UTF-8 caption?

Hi,
I'd like to display some text markers with Chinese characters in rviz.
So I tried:
marker.text  = text.encode('UTF-8')

and the marker.text therefor in the u'\u5b57\u8282' form.
But nothing pop out.
Any suggestion to make it work?
Thanks!

A:

No, rviz does not handle UTF-8 text. It only handles a portion of the ASCII character set.
There is an open ticket for this on the rviz bug tracker.
