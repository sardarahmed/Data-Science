A:

Well, those errors are more deeper than I thought...
I had experiences with this (most because of Open CV old version installed with Kinetic). My solution was to uninstall ROS, everything from python and then reinstall it.
I recommend to uninstall ROS following this:
sudo apt-get purge '^ros-*'
sudo apt-get autoremove

and then installing again (after python 2.7)
Try this and tell me later, best regards

It worked. I had some problems (" is not installed, so not removed") but I managed to solve them manually deleting the ROS folder from /etc. Thank you!
