Q:

Introduction books for ROS INDIGO

Hi there,
I am pretty new to ROS and would like to have some books for introduction parts. I know there are plenty of tutorials in the net, but i just prefer books.
I already found following book:
Learning ROS for Robotics Programmin.
But this book is based on ROS Fuerte I guees.
Do you have any suggestions.
Best regards

Yes this is the new version, however material is the same, just the book is updated for catkin workspaces instead of rosbuild.
