Q:

Book: Learning ROS for Robotics Programming, 2nd Edn; Chapter 4 example1 Not Working - dynamaximal driver not installed

I thoroughly followed all the instructions given on chapter 4 of the book (Learning ROS for Robotics Programming 2nd edition) on Jade. That's the error I am seeing ![image description]. I have also followed all the instructions given in ROS tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/WritingTeleopNode) but doing this giving me another type of error i.e. dynamaximal driver not installed. If possible please help me for any of it.
I am using ubuntu 15.04 on Jade. Thanks in advance.

I have a suspicion that this is a CMake problem; when you update your question please also include your CMakeLists.txt

A:

Thanks ahendrix, I figured out this problem. The main problem was with the book. In the next section there was a tutorial about dynamaximal motors and package for its installation. As, I had not installed it, I was getting error because of it. I installed that package and it started working. Thanks for your kindness.
