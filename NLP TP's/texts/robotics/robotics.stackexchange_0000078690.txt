Q:

Using diff_drive_controller for a robot with off-centre wheels

Hi.
I'm attempting to use the diff_drive_controller package in ros_control for a robot which has wheels positioned off-centre (i.e. at the front of the robot). It then has a caster wheel at the back. In reality, the robot rotates about the centre of the two front wheels. However, the odometry published by diff_drive_controller rotates the robot about the base_link. Is there a way to correct this?
Many thanks.

A:

The way I have achieved this is to create a link at my desired point of rotation, then to set the diff_drive_controller parameter base_frame_id equal to that link.
