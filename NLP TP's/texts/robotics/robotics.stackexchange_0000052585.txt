int main(int argc, char** argv){
  ros::init(argc, argv, "robot_tf_publisher");
  ros::NodeHandle n;
  ros::Rate r(100);
  tf::TransformBroadcaster broadcaster;
  while(n.ok()){
    broadcaster.sendTransform(
      tf::StampedTransform(
        tf::Transform(tf::Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1), tf::Vector3(0.1, 0.0, 0.2)),
        ros::Time::now(),"base_link", "base_laser"));
    r.sleep();

Oooh! I like this =) (I'm leaving my answer as it has a lower threshold to get working, but this is far superior)
