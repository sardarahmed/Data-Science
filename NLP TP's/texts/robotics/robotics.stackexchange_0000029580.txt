Q:

What driver should I use for my USB camera?

I see people using lots of different ROS packages to work with their USB webcams. What are the options?

What cameras does the driver support?
Which features does it have?
What's the license?
Where can I get it?

A:

Most recent consumer webcams are compatible with the USB video class (UVC) device specification. ROS has several drivers that support these cameras as well as some non-UVC-compliant ones.
