Q:

ros_control on embedded linux / rosserial

Hi there,
is there any know way to make the c++ api described in the ros_control tutorials
(https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/wiki/hardware_interface)
(http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control/Tutorials/Loading%20and%20starting%20controllers%20through%20service%20calls)
(http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control)
work on a ROS Node, that runs on an embedded linux client?
In my case, I need a working solution for ros_control to work with a Lego Mindstorm EV3 running embedded linux. The EV3 communicates with a central PC over rosserial (rosserial_embeddedlinux) using WiFi / Bluetooth. I am already able to publish joint_state_msgs from the EV3, but I don't see any chances to get ros_control running.
Thanks for your thoughts!
best regards
psei

A:

rosserial only allows to publish and receive ROS messages on a non-ROS system.
To run ros_control nodes, you will need a complete ROS system on the computer.
