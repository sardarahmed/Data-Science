ROS2 will replace ROS or will the two platforms exist?

A:

It is likely that ROS 1 and ROS 2 will coexist for a very long time. Ultimately ROS 2 is supposed to "replace" ROS 1 but there is currently no plan to discontinue ROS 1.
That being said at least in the ROS 1 base packages not much feature development is being done (especially by OSRF) in favor of focusing the resources on ROS 2.

I think that the change to ROS 2 should be a very substantial change in the base, otherwise it would be logical to remodel ROS 1. This means that the knowledge about ROS 1 will not be useful for ROS 2?

I don't think this is a valid conclusion. ROS 2 shares a lot of concepts with ROS 1 and those are valuable knowledge across the different versions. For details on the rational why changes were not applied to ROS 1 please see the design doc.
