Q:

Generic name for two-motor wheeled/tracked robots?

Is there a generic name for the category of robots that move using two opposing wheels or tank-like treads?

A:

Robots with two opposing wheels and usually a castor wheel for balancing reasons (no motor attached) are called Differential Drive Robots.

A:

To append Demetris answer, if it has tank-like treads or even 4 fixed wheels, then you can also call it a skid steer vehicle.
