Q:

Two PR2 simulation in gazebo

I am on ROS Fuerte, I am using PR2 simulations in gazebo with the pr2_gazebo package,
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch

I wish to work on two PR2 robots, I tried to add a second robot with the following line in the pr2_empty_world.launch.
  <!-- start pr2 robot -->
  <include file="$(find pr2_gazebo)/launch/pr2.launch"/>

Which gave the following error;
roslaunch file contains multiple nodes named [/spawn_pr2_model].
Please check all <node> 'name' attributes to make sure they are unique.
Also check that $(anon id) use different ids.

Apparently it is a trivial issue, and I have been tinkering with launch files but that has not solved the issue. Any help here would be most welcome.

A:

Hello.
Nodes must have a unique name when roslaunched Take a look into pr2.launch to see how the launch is exactly done, you'll see that you're roslauching twice the same node with the same name.

@Erwan R. I get the point, but how do I rectify it ??? I would wish to have 2 nodes as /spawn_pr2_model_1 and /spawn_pr2_model_2 !!! How do I do it ?

Write your own pr2_2robot_empty_world.launch inspired by the original one. You'll have to check the content of the included pr2.launch and, for example, paste it twice into your file with different names for nodes.

Go deeper : in pr2.launch are included pr2_no_controller.launch where spawn_pr2_model node is launched. You can start from this point and duplicate the node line. Be careful about the -model name too. gazebo needs unique name for each object. Please be more precise if there is still a problem.
