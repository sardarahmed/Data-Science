Q:

Can I use a package with a different distribution for which it was made?

Hello all,
I want to use a realsense camera with ROS. The package for this can be found here. The problem/question I have is, can I use this with ROS melodic, even thought in the package page is says it was made for indigo and kinetic? To my understanding, if there have not been any huge changes between to different ROS distributions, the package should work properly with newer distributions. Additionally, I'm installing the package from source, so I thought it should work.
I followed the steps for the installation, found here. However, after I did, ROS does not see the package. I write "rosrun real" followed by a double tab, to show packages that start with this name, but nothing. I also wrote down the whole name, with no results.
Any sugestions/ideas? Am I just not installing from source the package correctly (I have limited experience with this)?

If you have any errors please update your question with them

A:

Yes, you can use packages that were written for another distribution of ROS than the one that you're currently using. You will most likely need to download the source and compile it yourself vs using apt. Once you compile it, then source your setup.bash with
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash

Note: you may run into issues using a package that's meant for one distribution of ROS on another, but you may not.

Hmm this is weird. I thought I tried this already. I attempted to do it again today and it worked. I guess after to much time working on it yesterday, I confused my self. In any case, thanks. It is up and running now.
