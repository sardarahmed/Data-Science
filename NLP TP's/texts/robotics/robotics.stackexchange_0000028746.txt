Q:

GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH on the command line?

I understand that I can use custom models using the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=path/to/models

Is there a way to do this from the command line?
Thanks.

Not sure I understand the question, you can use the command you mentioned on the command line, right?

Thanks for the response, @chapulina. My question wasn't well formed. I was looking to avoid dependency on environment variables... and was looking for an option like "gazebo -m path/to/models".

Thanks for the clarification. There's no command-line argument to set model/plugin/resource paths, but it could be an interesting addition.
