A:

Hi @DavidXiong,
The pi_face_tracker_gui package (created by Scott Bell) requires the older Version 1 rosbridge package which can be found here.  It looks like you have rosbridge_suite installed which I believe is the newer Version 2 rosbridge.  So you can either install the Version 1 rosbridge or just comment out the  line in the manifest.xml for the pi_face_tracker_gui assuming you can do without the GUI for now.  (The rest of the pi_face_tracker package does not require the GUI.)
