A:

According to REP 3 (which defines the target platforms for each ROS Distribution Release):

Kinetic Kame (May 2016 - May 2021)
Required Support for:

Ubuntu Wily (15.10)
Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)

So, it's not supported meaning you can't use apt to install it on Ubuntu 17 (Zesty). You can, however, install Lunar Loggerhead on Ubuntu 17 (Zesty).

That doesn't mean that it's not good or that it shouldn't be used.

yeah we can use that but sometimes we get in problem and we cant solve that with our self so its better to use 16.04 with kinetic , its only my opinion Bro
