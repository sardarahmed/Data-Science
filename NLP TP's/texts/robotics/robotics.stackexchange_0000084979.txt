Q:

package or stack wiki for ROS2

Is there any guideline about how to create 3rd party package or stack wiki for ROS2?
For ROS1, contributors are free to create such wiki pages under http://wiki.ros.org (e.g. RealSense ), but not sure how ROS2 will manage this?

A:

At the moment there is no similar infrastructure to wiki.ros.org for ROS 2. The ROS 2 wiki provides some information but lacks the convenience of the wiki macros like PackageHeader.
The ROS 1 wiki is based on MoinMoin and has exceeded the recommended maximum number of pages a long time ago. That is why we don't want to start adding ROS 2 specific information into it.
In the long term the goal is to have a similar infrastructure as for ROS 1 but currently the work towards that hasn't been started yet.

Thanks, Thomas. Since I'm working on ROS2 packages (e.g. RealSense I mentioned above) and I'd like to create ROS2 wiki page for such package or stack, what's your recommendation so far? May I create a new wiki page under ROS 2 wiki directly?

That sounds fine with me.
