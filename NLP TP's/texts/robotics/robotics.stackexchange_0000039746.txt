Q:

checkout openni_ros for electric source installed

Is there a way to checkout the openni_ros package for a source installed electric ros version?
https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_ros/file/1f99fa033d83/
is the package I want.
I needed to install the electric version with the source to use the pcl-trunk.
Now I want to install the openni_ros package to run my asus xtion sensor.
Thanks Stefan

A:

I found the solution. On the linked website the revision number is displayed and then I did:

hg clone -r 477 https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_ros
