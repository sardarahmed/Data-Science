A:

For packages that have no binary release for a particular ROS version (or OS), you can always try to build them from sources.
No guarantees though (dependencies could not be available, there could be breaking changes in dependencies, etc).
See #q252478 for the general procedure. Pay special attention to where the dependencies are installed.
