Q:

Good book on mechanisms

I am working with students (9th & 10th grade) on robotics and wanted to get a good book which covers basic mechanisms.  Does anyone have any recommendations.  Searching Google or Amazon yields many results, however, I thought the community might have a standard book to use.  

A:

The best book I have seen on the subject of mechanisms is Mechanisms And Mechanical Devices by Neil Sclater and Nicholas P. Chironis.

It's got loads of great mechanisms in it, from simple linear movements:

... to complex packaging machines:

It also covers robotics.
