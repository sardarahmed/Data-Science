Q:

Problem with tutorials

Hi
In the "Using the Statemachine Editor" tutorial one is told to go to configuration tab and do some stuff in the State Library window. The problem is that I don't see any State Libray window.
Here are the complete directions:

Start implementing the behavior by adding FlexBe built-in state library to your FlexBe App. This state library is included in flexbe_behavior_engine/flexbe_states/src/flexbe_states. Go to configuration tab, in State Library window click Add Folder and select your flexbe_states folder. This procedure is also performed to add another state library that other people made.

Is this something I can just ignore?
regards
Frimann

Can you please update your question with a link to the tutorial that you're referring to

A:

Thanks for pointing this out! Apparently, I missed it when I updated the tutorial from its previous version.
You can indeed ignore this paragraph, manually adding state packages is not required anymore. I already updated the tutorial now.
