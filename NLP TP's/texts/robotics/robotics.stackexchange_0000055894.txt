Q:

Could not find a configuration file for package *

Here's a minimal catkin package.
Package.xml:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package>
  <name>sighdangitcatkin</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>
  <description>The sighdangitcatkin package</description>
  <maintainer email="dlu@todo.todo">dlu</maintainer>
  <license>TODO</license>
  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
  <build_depend>orocos_kdl</build_depend>
</package>

CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(sighdangitcatkin)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS orocos_kdl )
catkin_package()

Seems pretty simple, yah? Here's the error I get when compiling.
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'sighdangitcatkin'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(sighdangitcatkin)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package orocos_kdl.

  Set orocos_kdl_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
  for orocos_kdl.  The file will have one of the following names:

    orocos_kdlConfig.cmake
    orocos_kdl-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  sighdangitcatkin/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

What am I missing?
Note: It works fine if you use this CMake..
 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
 project(sighdangitcatkin)
 find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS )
 find_package(orocos_kdl REQUIRED)
 catkin_package()

Essentially.
Comment by Eman on 2013-12-05:
please, would you make sure that ROS can see & find your package
I mean by that Did you try typing command rospack find ( your_package_name)
or using command roscd (your_package_name) then typing unix command pwd
either using command rospack find or using commands  roscd then pwd
it should return your package path if ROS can find your package in the src folder of catkin_ws in your home
please , make sure of that

@Real Loyalty For future edits of your posts / comments please consider checking the check box "minor edit - don't send alerts" if you modifications are minor (e.g. spelling and white space fixing) to avoid numerous notification emails to subscribed users. Thx.

@Dirk Thomas  Thx for your note .  I will take care about that

A:

It looks like orocos_kdl is not a catkin package:
https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics/blob/master/orocos_kdl/package.xml#L20
So having catkin find it will not work...
I would recommend you use the find_package(orocos_kdl REQUIRED) line in your catkin package.

So it is still a package, and a package you can build catkin on top of, but not a catkin package?
Comment by William on 2013-12-05:
It is a non-catkin package as described in REP-136, just like opencv, console_bridge, and others. We support building it as part of a catkin workspace using catkin_make_isolated as a convenience, but no they are not catkin packages.
Comment by David Lu on 2013-12-06:
Understood. Is there any way to shortcut the above error message so that it instead says "Attempting to make catkin depend on non-catkin package. Don't do that." or something more helpful than the CMake gobbeldygook?
Comment by William on 2013-12-06:
I don't believe so, the problem is that orocos_kdl doesn't provide a file called orocos_kdlConfig.cmake or orocos_kdl-config.cmake, which is what CMake is complaining about. So we don't know if it is a missing package or a package which is not a catkin package. If orocos_kdl provided one of those files (as a coincident), then catkin would inform you that it found orocos_kdl, but that it is not a catkin package. Additionally, error handling like try-catch is really problematic in CMake, so we would have to completely rewrite parts of CMake's find_package to do better error handling.
