Q:

Colcon build error : 0 packages finished

I am using ROS2 humble on Windows 10 and it is installed successfully. Now I am going through this tutorial for creating a workspace:
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html
But while I am using the “colcon build --merge install” command I face the following error message:
Failed <<< turtlesim [9.41s, exited with code 1]

Summary: 0 packages finished [9.75s]
1 package failed: turtlesim
1 package had stderr output: turtlesim
WNDPROC return value cannot be converted to LRESULT
TypeError: WPARAM is simple, so must be an int object (got NoneType)

You can see the full error message here:

however, it creates the “build, install and log folder” on my workspace, and also “ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node” opens the turtlesim.
It seems that the turtlesim package comes pre-built along with the ros2 installation and it is not calling the turtlesim package on my ros2_ws at all. So, when I modify the overlay like this:
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html#modify-the-overlay
Nothing has happened; this is about 1 week I am stuck in this step, could anyone help me in this regard? I should mention that I installed “em”, “empty” and none of them fixed the problem.

A:

I solved this problem by uninstalling "Python 3.12, 64-bit version" which had been installed on my system because I found the CMake error refers to a Python 3.12 on my system and I didn't know why it should have existed on my system (During ROS2 installation I had installed python 3.8, not 3.12). So, I called the following command in the command prompt, and I was assured an extra Python version was installed on my system:
> py -0

which returned:
Installed Pythons found by py Launcher for Windows
-3.8-64 *
-3.12-64

I decided to uninstall version 3.12 so that ROS2 just uses Python 3.8. Fortunately, it fixed my issue.
