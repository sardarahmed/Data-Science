Q:

Catkin_Make Android_Core Error in Hydro

I'm following the tutorial at
http://wiki.ros.org/sig/Rosjava/Android%20Development%20Environment/hydro
to set up my Android Workspace. I'm following the steps and I built rosjava. The very last step of doing 'catkin_make' to the android workspace results in this error
lucid@lucid-MacBookPro:~/android$ catkin_make
Base path: /home/lucid/android
Source space: /home/lucid/android/src
Build space: /home/lucid/android/build
Devel space: /home/lucid/android/devel

Invoking "make" failed

where is this 'maven' file?

A:

That implementation shouldn't be using the ros devel workspace maven paths yet (that is in the works). I've rewinded the rosinstall file to use the correct tag (see here so the roswiki instructions should work across chained workspaces now.

That functionality got moved to rosjava_bootstrap but this problem has been resolved for a long time now. Do you have similar problems with chained workspaces?
