Q:

Does ros have some package that can provide linear and circular interpolation

hello, I am using ros to control a six-dof robot arm and can realize inverse kinematics.
Now I want to control it to move in the cartesian space, which may need linear and circular interpolation,
so how could achieve this fastly as I am new about this and does ros have some package can help me do this?
Thank you for help!

A:

In the DRC we used piecewise linear cartesian motions to approximate circular motion. A helper function for this is getCircularArcPoses , which just generates poses lying on a circular arc. An example of it being called is here. The poses are then forwarded to MoveIt's cartesian planner starting here and then sent to the robot for execution.
