Q:

How do I make catkin_make check for required python modules?

I would like for catkin_make to fail if a fellow developer does not have all of the required python modules installed.  I thought that I could do this using the package.xml manifest, but I may just be doing something wrong.
I would like to make sure that another developer has the python "requests" module installed on their system, but it could be any other non-standard python module from apt-get or pip.
Am I on the right track?  Should I try to add something to CMakeLists.txt to get this behavior?
Here's a snippet of my package.xml file:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package>
  <name>awesome</name>
  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>

  <build_depend>rospy</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
  <build_depend>actionlib</build_depend>

  <run_depend>rospy</run_depend>
  <run_depend>std_msgs</run_depend>
  <run_depend>actionlib</run_depend>
  <run_depend>roslib</run_depend>

  <run_depend>os</run_depend>
  <run_depend>sys</run_depend>
  <run_depend>json</run_depend>
  <run_depend>yaml</run_depend>
  <run_depend>uuid</run_depend>
  <run_depend>boto3</run_depend>
  <run_depend>zipfile</run_depend>
  <run_depend>threading</run_depend>
  <run_depend>requests</run_depend>
</package>

A:

AFAIK, you cannot do this via catkin_make. You can however check with rosdep check <PACKAGE_NAME> if all packages are installed, or install them via rosdep install <PACKAGE_NAME>.
The -v flag turns on verbose output.
Note, however, that in the package.xml you need to have the respective rosdep keys, which are defined (here)[https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/python.yaml]. Many of the modules you specified are available in the python standard library, thus you probably would not need to specify those.
For the requests module, you have to specify python-requests which gets resolved via rosdep for the different distributions.
