Q:

receiving transform from [/robot_state_publisher] that differed from ROS time

Hello ALL I'm beginner to ros
I have mounted zed camera on my youBot robot and connected the tf tree as follows:
![image description](tf frames)
when I visualize in rviz the camera only works when I choose the arm_link_5 or base_link_zed and its children as fixed frame and I want it to work when using odom as fixed frame since I have a linked tf tree.

when running roswtf i get:
receiving transform from [/robot_state_publisher] that differed from ROS time by 566050.175641s

so is the problem with the transfer frequency and if so how can i fix it?

Could you check your screenshots? You didn't have enough karma before, so they were never attached.

A:

fixed it by synchronising the time.

I know it has been some time now but could you explain how you did this ?

My camera was connected to nvidia jetson and my robot has its own computer, after connecting ros between both devices I noticed that the time is not the same(like by minutes) so I used ntpdate to update the time on both
