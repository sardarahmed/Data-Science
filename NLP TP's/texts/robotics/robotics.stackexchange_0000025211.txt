Q:

how to set fdir1, mu1, and mu2 in the gazebo tag inside a urdf file

My problem is how to set the fdir1 for cylinder model.According the gazebo tutorial ref, the direction of mu2 is perpendicular to the mu1, and the first direction is indicated by fdir1. I try to refer to te turtlebot3 description, the fdir1 they used for their model is
<gazebo reference="wheel_left_link">
<mu1>0.1</mu1>
<mu2>0.1</mu2>
<kp>500000.0</kp>
<kd>10.0</kd>
<minDepth>0.001</minDepth>
<maxVel>0.1</maxVel>
<fdir1>1 0 0</fdir1>
<material>Gazebo/FlatBlack</material>

their wheels pose is

Does it mean the first friction direction is along x(red)?, what is the second frcition direction? What if I set the fdir1 = "0,0,1", what would happen? Does this mean the friction is not working for this model? Besides, when the robot is moving , the wheel is rotating, the local frame of wheel is changing, does it mean the first friction direction is changing?
Please help me understand this problem! Thank you

A:

The documentation you link to explains that "fdir1" defines the direction of mu in the "collision local frame". This is not the frame of the wheel link. It is a generated frame at the point of contact between two objects.
Note that the parameter is named "mu", not "mu1".
You chose which friction model is used by the ODE physics engine. As explained on this page the default friction model ("pyramid") has mu/mu2 aligned to the world's x and y axis.
To simulate the friction of a wheel edge in vertical contact with the ground plane, fdir should be "1 0 0". My understanding is that each digit selects a plane for mu and mu2 to apply to: xy, yz, zx axes.
