Q:

Migration of older rosdep.yaml bash entries to Groovy

What is the preferred method for migrating the old multi-line bash script entries in rosdep.yaml files? REP-0111 says that compatiblity was eliminated in Fuerte:
http://ros.org/reps/rep-0111.html#backwards-compatibility
Multi-line entries in rosdep.yaml used to be interpreted as bash files, allowing fancy manipulations of dependencies. Is there a migration path for these types of entries? If they are no longer permitted, shouldn't the rosdistro default files eliminate any entries that have bash style entries?
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml
I saw that a similar question was asked here, but no real solution was given. And placing a sudo requiring make install in a package makefile can get swallowed up in rosmake.

A:

Embedded bash commands are no longer supported by rosdep2.
I don't believe there is any migration path for those rules. So, they should be removed from the rosdistro files.
I would be happy for someone to convince me this answer is wrong.

I understand that they are no longer supported. I am asking what is the migration path? Custom packages have issues with sudo?

In most cases, the preferred migration path is to create 3rd-party packages instead of downloading and manipulating source code. http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/ReleaseThirdParty  .
