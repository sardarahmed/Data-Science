Q:

rosgraph: No definition of [python-netifaces] for OS [osx]

I ran into some trouble while attempting a ros installation of groovy via Homebrew.  When trying to execute the following command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y

I continue seeing this issue:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks
could not have their rosdep keys
resolved to system dependencies:
rosgraph: No definition of
[python-netifaces] for OS [osx]

I'm not sure how to proceed here.

A:

I submitted a pull request on github to address the issue:
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/597
As the error states, there was no definition in the homebrew yaml file for python-netifaces.  A new definition has been added called 'python-netifaces', which points to the netifaces pip.
