Q:

hector_quadrotor does not take off

Hi,
I am using ROS kinetic and since the tutorials on
http://wiki.ros.org/hector_quadrotor/Tutorials/Quadrotor%20outdoor%20flight%20demo
is a littile bit out-dated, I followed the answer in
http://answers.ros.org/question/244776/is-it-possible-to-run-the-hector_quadrotor-demos-in-kinetic/.
It did compile and roslaunch the demo successfully. I've checked the rostopic list and found there is actually a topic called /cmd_vel. I tried to use this command to let the quadrotor take-off
rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  '{linear:  {x: 0, y: 0.0, z: 1.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}'

But the quadrotor still stays on the ground. I used
rostopic echo /cmd_vel

to check if the message is sent to the topic correctly,  and it does.
Does someone know what can be possibly wrong?

A:

You should first enable motors
rosservice call /enable_motors true
