A:

Check out the urdf tutorials. The tutorials explain how to add meshes to links.
If you need more specific help, you will have to provide your current urdf and your meshes.

I am having trouble using mesh files in my URDF file. My main doubt is how will I specify the origin, joint origin for a complex mesh object?
