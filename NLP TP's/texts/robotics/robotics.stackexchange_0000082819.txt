Q:

Unable to load plugin for transport 'image_transport/compressed_sub'

I am using Kinect on Ubuntu 16.04.
After executing
rosrun image_view extract_images image_transport/compressed_sub

I get
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'image_transport::TransportLoadException'
what():  Unable to load plugin for transport 'image_transport/compressed_sub', error string:
According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class image_transport/image_transport/compressed_sub_sub with base class type image_transport::SubscriberPlugin does not exist. Declared types are  image_transport/compressedDepth_sub image_transport/compressed_sub image_transport/raw_sub image_transport/theora_sub
Aborted (core dumped)

What surprises me is the name of the class, which seems to me a little redundant.
image_transport/image_transport/compressed_sub_sub
instead of
image_transport/compressed_sub
Is this maybe be a bug?
EDIT:
I do have compressed_image_transport installed

A:

I needed to install image_transport_plugins
The fix for ubuntu users:
apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-image-transport-plugins
