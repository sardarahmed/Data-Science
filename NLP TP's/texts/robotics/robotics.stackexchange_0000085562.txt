Q:

Question about sending parameters from remote Android device to ROS

I'm developing an APK to send a number of parameters (integers and floats) to a ROS application through rosbridge. However I'm stumped at how to proceed. The parameters are to be used by particular nodes to do some operations with images. My question is, is it possible to send those parameters directly to the node or do I have to publish those parameters in an intermediary topic to then subscribe the nodes I already have to the appropriate parameter topics?

A:

You have a few options:

You can use the ROS parameter server with the rosbridge according to this. The parameter server is more for setting parameters that do not change during the operation of the nodes.
If you need the parameters to constantly change throughout operation then publishing a custom message with all your parameters in it should work. Or publishing multiple primitive types (ints, floats) to various subtopics such as /image_params/width and /image_params/height could work if the rosbridge doesn't allow custom messages.
I would suggest dynamic reconfigure, but I'm not sure if rosbridge supports it

The second option was the one I used and it worked fine. Thanks for your help IanCol

For the third option, see Changing dynamic_reconfigure parameters using rosbridge
