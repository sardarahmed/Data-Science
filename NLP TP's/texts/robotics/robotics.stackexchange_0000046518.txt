Q:

ar_markers - import coordinates python file

Hi.
I use the ar_kinect package to recognize the ar_markers.
I like to import the coordinates in the python file so I have to initialise the Markers which I use at the begin of the file and found this example:
self.markers = { 0: ["ILS_OFFICE",-0.4064,-1.22,0.6858,-1.570796,0,0] }
My question is, what are the six numbers after the name from the marker (here: "ILS_OFFICE") and where I get this information for my marker?
Thanks for help!

A:

The 6-tuple you refer to is the 3D position/orientation:
[x,y,z,theta_x,theta_y,theta_z]
(theta_i means angle around the i axis)
