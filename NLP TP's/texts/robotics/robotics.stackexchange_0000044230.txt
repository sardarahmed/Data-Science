A:

It looks like the tutorial was never updated when actionlib.
The line should read:
from actionlib_msgs.msg import *

I've filed a ticket here: https://kforge.ros.org/smach/trac/ticket/2

I change in smach_tutorials/examples/actionlib.py as you advice:
from actionlib_msgs.msg import *
But I got another error:
...
action_server_wrapper.py", line 9, in 
from actionlib.simple_action_server import SimpleActionServer
ImportError: No module named simple_action_server
