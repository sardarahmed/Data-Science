Q:

ROS_NAMESPACE , tf , turtlebot_bringup and turtlebot_navigation

Hi All,
I'm looking to provide a namespace for my turtlebot.
In my .bashrc file, I've set:
export TURTLEBOT_NAME=Dave and
export ROS_NAMESPACE=$TURTLEBOT_NAME
After launching turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch and turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch the list of topics are all in the /Dave namespace, however the following:  /dave/incompatible_rapp_list /dave/rapp_list /dave/status /diagnostics /diagnostics_agg /diagnostics_toplevel_state /rosout /rosout_agg /scan /tf /tf_static are not or have incorrect namespace. dave not Dave. More importantly I'm looking to solve the tf and tf_static because those are very important for actual navigation. I was looking at this ROS Answers but couldn't solve my problem.
Any thoughts?
Thanks :)

Not sure whether this is your issue, but: by convention the use of uppercase names is typically discouraged (it is allowed though, see wiki/Naming). It could be that some nodes are (incorrectly) lowercasing any names they receive, resulting in the Dave->dave problem.

Got it, thanks. Any thoughts on the tf and tf_static frames naming?

Take a look at Simulating Multiple Husky UGVs in Gazebo on the clearpath blog. That is specifically about running two instances of Husky at the same time in Gazebo, but probably deals with the same issue(s).

A:

I was wrong all along, tf and tf_static need to be in their own namespace.
