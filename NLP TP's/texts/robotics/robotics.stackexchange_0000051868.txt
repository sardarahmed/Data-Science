Q:

change path of roscd

I am following the tutorials of the ros man page. I have a query. Whenever I use roscd beginner_tutorials I get:
/catkin_ws/install/share/beginner_tutorials$

How can I change roscd so that it gives me the path of beginner_tutorials in the /catkin_ws/devel/lib/beginner_tutorials folder

A:

This question is directly related to a problem you are trying to solve in your previous question.
Make sure you are familiar with this tutorial.
In short, there are install space and development space. If you source devel/setup.bash then roscd beginner_tutorials should bring you to ~/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials. But if you source install/setup.bash then it will bring you to the directory where the package was installed.
