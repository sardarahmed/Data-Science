Q:

I need the specifications for iRobot Create 2

I need the specifications for the Create 2. I need it for research purposes. So I think I'm going to need a high computational computer on board.
Please suggest some nice configuration. 

A:

I'm not sure which specifications you're asking about, but the manual is here.
As far as "nice configuration," it really depends on what you're up to. A Raspberry Pi 2 can run ROS reasonably well, and is relatively inexpensive. As a bonus, there's a write-up on how to hook up a Pi here. You could also use a netbook with the supplied Create 2 to USB cable.
