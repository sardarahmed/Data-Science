Q:

How to save map by using map_server package according to the topics?

I used the multi_map_merge package to merge map from robot 1 and robot 2. But when I used rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map, the map is only saved the merge map which is from /map topic. But I also would like to save map from /tb3_0/map and /tb3_1/map topics. I would like to ask how to save map according to the map topics? Thank you in advance.
