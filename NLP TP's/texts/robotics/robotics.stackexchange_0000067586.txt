Q:

Problem building ar_kinect

Hello everyone,
Can anyone help me? I'm working with ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.
I need to read some tags through artoolkit using a kinect camera. I had cloned ar_kinect into my catkin_workspace and if I rospack find ar_kinect I get /home/leandrosavieira/catkin_ws/src/ar_kinect.
However, when I try to build the catkin_workspace through catkin_make --pkg ar_kinect, I receive an error that the package is not found:
Base path: /home/leandrosavieira/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/leandrosavieira/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/leandrosavieira/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/leandrosavieira/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/leandrosavieira/catkin_ws/install
Packages "ar_kinect" not found in the workspace

Am I doing anything wrong? I'm new with ROS and I need to make this work soon.
--EDIT 1:
I also tried to build the package ar_kinect using rosmake ar_kinect, but I get the following error:

A:

ar_kinect is a build nightmare due to the difficulty of building/installing ar_toolkit -- neither project is really maintained at the moment. I highly suggest looking at ar_track_alvar as a stable, robust tag tracking system (and I'm the author of ar_kinect).
