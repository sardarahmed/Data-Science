Q:

publish multiple data on one topic

Hello,
Is it possible to publish multiple data i.e angle for servo1 and angle for servo2 on one topic ? If yes, please show me answer how to do it.
Thanks in advance.

Edit:  Thank you sir for your answer.
But still getting the error as "Segmentation fault(core dumped)"
Please consider my procedure:
sensor_msgs::JointState joint;
joint.position[1] = 50;
joint.velocity[1] = 100;
joint.effort[1] = 90;

dd.publish(joint);

qDebug() << "position =" << joint.position[1];
qDebug() << "velocity =" << joint.velocity[1];
qDebug() << "effort =" << joint.effort[1];

ok i will take care of it

A:

The vectors containing position, velocity and effort default to a size of zero. You either have to use push_back or resize the vectors before writing to them.
sensor_msgs::JointState joint;
joint.position.push_back(50);
joint.velocity.push_back(100);
joint.effort.push_back(90);

or
sensor_msgs::JointState joint;
joint.position.resize(1);
joint.velocity.resize(1);
joint.effort.resize(1);
joint.position[0] = 50;
joint.velocity[0] = 100;
joint.effort[0] = 90;
