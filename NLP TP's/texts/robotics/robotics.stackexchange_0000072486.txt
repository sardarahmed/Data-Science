Q:

Image conversion problem with image_view video_recorder

Hello,
I am trying to directly record a video from an image topic using video_recorder from image_view.
I am testing it with my laptop camera running
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch

When I launch the recording with
rosrun image_view video_recorder image:="/usb_cam/image_raw" _filename:="/home/user/video.avi" 

I get the following error "Unable to convert rgb8 image to bgr8".
I have also tryed using
rosrun image_view video_recorder image:="/usb_cam/image_raw" _filename:="/home/user/video.avi" _encoding:="rgb8"

but this produces "Unable to convert rgb8 image to rgb8".
The exact same happens for images published by the V-REP simulator (which is what I actually need to record in the end).
Any help would be very much appreciated.
Thanks.
Riccardo

No, I am afraid I didn't

A:

Hello! I just solved this issue, try to set the parameter "<param name="max_depth_range" value="0" />"enter code here . The default value is 5 and this seems to mess something up. That problem disappeared for me but I still cannot open the output video by the way.
