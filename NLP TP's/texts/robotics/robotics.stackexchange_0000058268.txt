Q:

SendingSimpleGoals tutorial: CMaker error

I am trying to do Sending simple goal tutorial. I did
catkin_create_pkg simple_navigation_goals move_base_msgs actionlib roscpp

I didn't do anything else (because I'm checking this tutorial only to learn how to include costmap_2d that I was trying to do but i couldn't manage  to complete) so I did
catkin_make

but there is an error
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package move_base_msgs.

there is some explanation how to fix it under an error
Set move_base_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
file for move_base_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

  move_base_msgsConfig.cmake
  move_base_msgs-config.cmake

why I have to set sth, shouldn't it work? Do i have some system variables wrong or sth?

A:

I guess you are running ROS Groovy.
There, move_base_msgs is not catkinized yet and thus cannot be find_packaged.
This is due to the fact that you cannot have dependencies from a catking pkg to a rosbuild pkg.
Either update to hydro or try the tutorial with rosbuild.

So there is no walk around, right?
