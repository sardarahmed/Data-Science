Q:

Is it possible to have a Service node in Python and the Client node in C++?

I am trying to use the rosserial library, in order to communicate my PC and an Arduino Mega 2560.
As rosserial for PC is only available in Python and I already have an entire code in C++, that's the reason of my question.
Thanks in advance

Congrats on 20,000th question!

A:

Yes.
ROS is a multi-lingual OS, the service-client specification is at the messaging layer. P2P communication occurs in XML-RPC. So you can just write your code in any language supported and let the mid-layer handle this for you.
You can take a look at the original paper:

Hope this helps.
