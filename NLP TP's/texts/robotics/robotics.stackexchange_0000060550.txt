Q:

How to teleop PR2 on ROS Hydro?

I install sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pr2-* successfully.
I found that pr2_teleop is suitable for groovy...
Where can I find teleop package for Hydro?
Thank you~

Hi Sam,
I believe the teleop PR2 has been catkinized but not released yet for Hydro. If you wish to install from source and alpha test please use this link to get the source:
http://github.com/PR2/pr2_apps/
and be sure to
git checkout -b hydro-devel

after you have git cloned :)
