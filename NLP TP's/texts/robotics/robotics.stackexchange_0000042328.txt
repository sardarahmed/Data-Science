Q:

Installation of Fuerte under Fedora 14

Hey,
I followed the instructions and everything went fine until the cmake stuff.
Fedora Installation Guide

cmake ..
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF
-- +++ catkin
-- Could NOT find PY_em (missing:  PY_EM)  CMake Error at
catkin/cmake/empy.cmake:29 (message):
Unable to find either executable
'empy' or Python module 'em'...  try
installing package 'python-empy' Call
Stack (most recent call first):
catkin/cmake/all.cmake:51 (include)
catkin/CMakeLists.txt:12 (include)

any ideas?

A:

It looks like you are missing the EmPy Python package. On Ubuntu that is installed as a Debian package dependency.
Maybe there is a corresponding Fedora 14 package. If so, I would use it.
Otherwise, try installing it with pip:
sudo pip install -U EmPy
