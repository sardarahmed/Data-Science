Probably you should provide with version of Gazebo are you using?

A:

There is a pause Launch Argument that you can set to true (defined here in the source)
Your launch command could look something like this:
import os
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource

def generate_launch_description():
    ld = LaunchDescription()
    gz_launch_path = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory('gazebo_ros'), 'launch', 'gazebo.launch.py')
    ld.add_action(
        IncludeLaunchDescription(
            PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(gz_launch_path), 
            launch_arguments={'pause': 'true'}.items()
    ))
    return ld

Thks for your support.
I have solved this by add this code in launch file
   load_gazebo= ExecuteProcess(
    cmd=['gazebo', '-u', "-s","libgazebo_ros_factory.so"],
    output='screen')

@shonigmann: could you please not close questions when they have an accepted answer? Askbot displays those mostly as [closed], which makes it look like there was no resolution. Accepting an answer already marks the question as answered, without needing to close it.

I'm not familiar with Askbot, but my intent was always to help people coming to ROS Answers to answer questions more readily find questions that haven't yet been resolved. But if its making things less visible, I can certainly save myself that step and avoid closing questions. Thanks for the feedback

Askbot is the software platform behind ROS Answers.

of course. I never doubted that.
But answered questions are already clearly marked as such, while closing them makes the "this is closed" part stand out more. So just accepting the correct answer would be enough.
