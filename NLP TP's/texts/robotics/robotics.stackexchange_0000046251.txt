Q:

Install of ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04 Failed

I want to undate ROS to Groovy from fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04. I have disabled Fuerte and then install Groovy following the manual on the Wiki step by step. When I installed the package:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full
E: Unable to locate package ros-groovy-desktop-full
Can anyone tell me what is the problem with this error?
