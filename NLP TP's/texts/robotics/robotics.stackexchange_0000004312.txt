Q:

Low-cost centimeter accurate satellite positioning (GNSS/GPS)

I am looking for a cheapest possible GPS setup with a centimeter precision without much HW hacking. I am not able to produce my PCB or do any soldering (though I would do that if there is no other way) so a kind of a easy-to-assemble setup would be welcome. I know about the $900 Piksi thing but that is still too expensive for me. It seems like cm precision should be possible for much less - like employing a 50 USD raw GPS sensor with an antenna and ordinary PC with RTKLIB software.
I am not sure if it is better to use two GPS sensor setup for RTK (one base station and one for rover) or whether I can get the corrective DGPS data elsewhere (my region is Czech Republic - there seems to be national grid here allowing to stream correction data for reasonable cost).
My application will be in a passenger car so I will not be limited with power source - no low power needed although that would be nice. I will be using the position readings within OpenCV - so I need to get the data into C/C++ code. The application is data collection so I can use raw GPS post-processing.

A:

The NS-HP is a $50 RTK-capable GPS receiver providing centimeter-level accuracy:

NS-HP is a high performance GPS receiver capable of 2 / 4 / 5 / 8 / 10 / 20 / 25 / 40 / 50 Hz update rate. At 1Hz update rate, NS-HP can accept RTCM 3.x message type 1002, 1004, 1005, and 1006, or SkyTraq raw measurement data from a base station to perform carrier phase RTK processing, achieving centimeter-level accuracy relative positioning.
One NS-HP is needed if wishing to use with other RTCM 3.x RTK base station within 10Km operating range. Two NS-HP is needed if wishing to setup a local NS-HP RTK base station to work with another NS-HP rover.
