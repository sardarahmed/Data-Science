Q:

pan_tilt_port: No motors found + Dynamixel MX-64AR

Hello,
I have attached a dynamixel motor MX-64AR via USB to my laptop. The distro of my ROS is indigo running of Ubuntu 14.04. I looked into other answers, but I couldn't solve my problem. When I run the following launch file:
<launch>
    <node name="dynamixel_manager" pkg="dynamixel_controllers" type="controller_manager.py" required="true" output="screen">
        <rosparam>
            namespace: dxl_manager
            serial_ports:
                pan_tilt_port:
                    port_name: "/dev/ttyUSB0"
                    baud_rate: 8000
                    min_motor_id: 1
                    max_motor_id: 4
                    update_rate: 20
        </rosparam>
    </node>
</launch>

I get the following output in the terminal:

Also I did : dmesg | grep tty
and got:

[  161.384192] usb 1-3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0

Can anyone help me to solve the problem. Do I need to add more information in the launch file?
Thank you.

8000 is a really strange nr for a baud rate. Are you sure that is correct?
Comment by MahsaP on 2016-06-02:
@gvdhoorn I looked into this link for setting the baud rate. Isn't it correct?

A:

The Dynamixel may support a baud rate of 8000, but that doesn't mean your FTDI converter supports it. That would be something to check. Perhaps see if 9600 works better, but it probably depends on what the Dynamixel is configured for.

@gvdhoorn Thanks for pointing out baud rate. I checked the manual again. I solved this baud rate issue.
Comment by Abdu on 2017-09-27:
I have this problem which cost me many days of effort without getting solution, please check it here what is the buad rate for dynamixel motor AX-12A
