Q:

what does add_dependence() do?

Hi, I am a new learner of ROS.
Recently, I created a package called beginner.
Then I did the test called WritingPublisherSubscriber.
When I added context into CMakeLists.txt, I copied directly
add_dependencies(listener beginner_turorials_generate_message_cpp)
add_dependencies(talker beginner_turorials_generate_message_cpp)

rather than
add_dependencies(listener beginner_generate_message_cpp)
add_dependencies(talker beginner_generate_message_cpp)

After I compiled it, the program ran nornally.
I was very confused about it.
Please tell me what happened inside

thanks a lot

A:

According to add_dependencies's documentation:

Add a dependency between top-level
targets.
add_dependencies(<target> [<target-dependency>]...)
Make a
top-level  depend on other
top-level targets to ensure that they
build before  does. A
top-level target is one created by
ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or
ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET. Dependencies added
to an IMPORTED target are followed
transitively in its place since the
target itself does not build.
See the DEPENDS option of
ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET and
ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND for adding
file-level dependencies in custom
rules. See the OBJECT_DEPENDS option
in SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES to add
file-level dependencies to object
files.

And just to note: @roovie: this is not something we made up in ROS, but is a piece of CMake infrastructure to allow you to express dependencies between (make) targets.
