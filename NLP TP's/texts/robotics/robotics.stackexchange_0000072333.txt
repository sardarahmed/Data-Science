Q:

Load ROS projects inside Eclipse

Hello all, I am trying quite a reasonable time to load a ros package as a project in Eclipse. Of course I am following the steps of section 2.2 Catkin-y approach from the tutorial IDEs but It is not working. I also checked the Catkin and eclipse answer. All the times that I tried to import a package as a Eclipse project I got No projects are found to import as show in the following screeshot:

I will appreciate any king of help or tip like: Should I reinstall eclipse, should I create a new catkin workspace, ...
Thanks.

A:

There are many things that you might be missing:

When doing catkin_make make sure that you have done catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" otherwise the Eclipse configuration files are not going to be there ( I assume this is OK). To validate this, in your build/ folder there should be two files: .cproject and .project.

I assume you are following the IDEs tutorial exactly as they say (regarding how Eclipse should be installed). Specially, regarding how you launch Eclipse. In my case, I have a EclipseROS.desktop file in~/.local/share/applications/ that looks as follows:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Eclipse 4
Type=Application
Exec=env SWT_GTK3=1 bash -i -c "/opt/eclipse/eclipse"
Terminal=false
Icon=/opt/eclipse/icon.xpm
Comment=Integrated Development Environment
NoDisplay=false
Categories=Development;IDE;
Name[en]=EclipseROS
Name[en_US]=EclipseROS

And my .bashrc constains source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`.

Finally, simply browse in your build/ folder, do not go down to the package folder, because is in build where the Eclipse configuration files .cproject and .project are generated (at least for catkin_make, for catkin tools a couple of files is generated for every package).

Thanks, everything was corrected but instead of browse in the build/ folder I was browsing in the packge folders. Naive mistake.
