Q:

Manually set a node to subscribe to a topic

Hi there!
I was wondering is there any way I can manually make a node to subscribe to a topic?
By checking rqt_graph, the node didn't subscribe to the topic (which I need to set) automatically.
Thanks!

A:

Maybe you should look at this: link text
Go to the line 75 of the subscriber node code, and that's what you have to add to the code of your node to subscribe to a specific topic.
