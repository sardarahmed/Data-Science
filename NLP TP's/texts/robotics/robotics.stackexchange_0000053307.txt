Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Gmapping path

I am using a hokuyo laser scanner and odometry with Gmapping to generate a map. The problem is that i need to have the path of which the robot has taken when recording the map.
I have cameras attached to it, which takes pictures which i transform to panorama pictures, and i need them to be on the map at the exact position they were taken.
I am using time as an indicator of when the pictures were taken and i would like to compare the coordinates of the robot with the time.
ps. i am new to Ros answers, please tell me if i need to include code/information/etc.

A:

Please make sure you don't miss any ROS tutorial thats relevant to you. Including those concepts at the bottom. For you most important is the tf concept.
Basically your camera has to be set a coordinate frame that is included in its image message's header, along with the timestamp. Then any node can ask the tf system what offset that frame had in respect to another (e.g. /map) for any given time (though I don't know the default history length).
