Q:

catkin - Suggestions for packaging isolated stacks (Orocos) with bloom?

I'm trying to build the catkinized version of Orocos as a third party catkin package. However, in the first step (FirstTimeRelease) I am running into issues where bloom is searching for the dependencies in rosdep, when they are actually inside the stack, and it errors out.
Is there a way to have bloom consider packages inside this stack as the dependencies?
I have also posted an issue on the orocos_toolchain project, which includes output from bloom-release: https://github.com/eacousineau/orocos_toolchain/blob/feature/tmp/bloom/bloom-orocos.txt#L201

A:

Do you mean that you are trying to release the orocos_toolchain?
The FirstTimeRelease tutorial does not apply to third party packages. Use this tutorial instead: http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/ReleaseThirdParty
Also, there is no notion of stacks in catkin.
Also, it looks like it makes heavy use of git submodules and even pulls in the dependencies as submodules...
bloom is know to not work with submodules:

I am actually not trying to release orocos_toolchain, just seeing if I can use bloom to generate debians for internal use. The Orocos catkin roadmap states that this is for Orocos >= v2.7.0, ROS >= Hydro, so I am just doing this on the side to see about near-term feasibility of transitioning to catkin (with ease of deployment).
Thank you for posting that issue about git-archive. I will look into git-archive-all, as well as possibly submitting a patch to git-archive for a `--include-submodules`` option.
