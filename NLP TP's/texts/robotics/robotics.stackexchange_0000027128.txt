Q:

Where is the gazebo_ros_api_plugin.cpp file located?

I've been trying to create my own subscribers/publishers with gazebo_ros and have had trouble finding this file: gazebo_ros_api_plugin.cpp. I'm assuming that this would be what I would need to modify in order to get the /gazebo node subscribing to new publishers and publishing to new subscribers. I have Ubuntu 12.04, Gazebo 1.9 (although that may have gotten updated to 3.0), ROS Hydro.
Thanks in advance!

Yes, but when you install it on a computer (from here http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros), where does it get placed?

If you install from pre-built debians, then the source file won't be included. If you install from source according to the instructions, then it will be at ~/catkin_ws/src/gazebo_ros_pkgs/gazebo_ros/src/gazebo_ros_api_plugin.cpp
