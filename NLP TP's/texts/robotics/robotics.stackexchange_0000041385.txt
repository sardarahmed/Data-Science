Q:

Is it possible to compile Wmake projects in ROS?

I am trying to compile a ROS node using OpenFOAM C++ libraries. OpenFOAM uses Wmake while ROS uses Cmake. How can I modify my CMakeLists.txt file so that the Cmake can:

Find the OpenFOAM .H files recursively installed in /opt/openfoam211/src
Find the pre-compiled OpenFOAM libraries (.so) also in /opt/openfoam211/platforms/linuxGccDPOpt/lib

I tried making a small Cmake script to recursively add all directories containing .H files using include_directories(). It finds all the .H files but I get the following error:
c++: error trying to exec 'usr/lib/gcc/i686-linux-gnu/4.6/cc1plus': execv: Argument list too long
I'm guessing I'm getting all the .H files making an enormous argument list.
I used target_link_libraries() for linking the libraries but I have no idea if it works since it never reaches that stage.
I'm using ROS fuerte on an Ubuntu 12.04 VM on Mac OS X Lion.
Thanks in advance!!!

A:

I'd suggest that you look at using OpenFoam after installing it.  To use it from within CMake you need to either have a CMake FindPackage file for it or a pkg-config file for it.
When it's installed, hopefully the includes are put into less distributed locations, so it's easier to write the above macros.
