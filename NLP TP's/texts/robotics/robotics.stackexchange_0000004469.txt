Q:

image size vs image resolution

I read somewhere that in the case of photoshop for example, the size refers to the number of pixels an image contains, but resolution involves the pixel's size, I don't know whether this definition goes for all the other fields. In computer vision, what's the difference between image size and image resolution?

A:

Image size and image resolution generally have the same meaning in most cases. They usually refer to the dimensions of a 2D image, measured in pixels.
Image size can refer to the dimensions of a printed image.
In other contexts, image resolution can refer to an image's spatial resolution, which is a measure of the number of independent pixel values per unit length measured in a world coordinate frame. For example, in satellite imagery, we can measure the quality of a lens by determining its spatial resolution from its images of the earth.
