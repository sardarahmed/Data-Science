Q:

Integrate actual robot into moveit(other way than ros_control?)

hello sir,
as a beginner, i just completed tutorials and found out the solution pretty near to it. but however, before proceeding, i think there must be another simpler way to do it....and here is my problem- i have written topics which when called without arguments gives joint positions, and if called with arguments, executes requested joint positions(though it should be service(to confirm for correct execution), i havent written so, thinking i might require to access them in multiple ways)(through these topics, i can only control joint position and speed(neither effort nor other parameter))
now how can i integrate into moveit? i mean, should i have to write ros_control for it or simply i have to publish(through a node-topics) to topics(like joint states), somewhere in moveit infrastructure?
thanks.

A:

If you have a sensor_msgs:/JointState publisher and a control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectory action server, you should be able to integrate with MoveIt!. Any solution properly exposing these interfaces should work.

Hey @adolfo-rodriguez-t, my hardware has an inbuilt position control algo(PID), so i dont actually need the PID control etc from ros_control. If i just need moveit's IK and collision detection, is it ok if I implement these actions and publisher, will I lose anything if I dont implement ros_control?

It is perfectly acceptable to use MoveIt without ros_control.
As Adolfo wrote above: as long as you provide the JointState and a FollowJointTrajectory action server, everything is fine.
