Q:

Creating a Gazebo World using a Ground Truth Model

Hi All,
I am just starting off with Gazebo to perform some multirobot simulations. In order to keep our project relevant to the topic, I wanted to perform these simulations in a visually relevant environment rather than a box world with obstacles. We have some ground truth models created using Faro Scans of the test site. I wanted to use these models as my Gazebo world and perform the simulations in there. Does anyone know if it is possible ?
Thanks
Ammar

A:

I assume the Faro scans are point cloud data. You would have to create a polygon representation out of that (for example using Meshlab) and save that as a .dae or .stl file. You can then use that inside a gazebo model and load it.
I did the same with a landscape modeled in Blender (COLLADA named "120m_landscape_smooth_tri.dae").
Here's the world file for electric's gazebo:

and here for fuerte:
