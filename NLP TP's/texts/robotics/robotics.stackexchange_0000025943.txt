Q:

Gazebo ROS Fuerte PR2 Reset

I mainly use PR2 in ROS Fuerte with Gazebo. However, whenever something goes wrong, I don't seem to have a reliable way of resetting world/robot. (I haven't tested in Groovy or standalone version.)
Whenever I reset Gazebo by "reset model poses" or "reset world", robot will start sliding in one direction.
Everything is fine when I relaunch Gazebo but that is lots of overhead especially on slower machines.
Is there some other way of reliably resetting to the original state?
Or, it it a known issue?
Thanks!

This is a known issue, tracked here https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/507/issues-with-reset-buttons
