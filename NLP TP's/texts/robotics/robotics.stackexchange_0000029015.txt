Q:

Gazebo /clock publish rate

Gazebo publishes /clock at 10Hz. Can this be increased and how?
Thank you!

A:

/clock publishes a message once per every new state, i.e. at 1/max_step_size Hz. You should rather focus on why your simulation runs so slow than the clock publish rate (did you perhaps tweak max_step_size?).
Nonetheless, if you still want to change the frequency, you can do that with the /gazebo/pub_clock_frequency parameter on the parameter server.

I am using default value i.e max_step_size = 0.001 but when I run ros2 topic hz /clock, I get avg 10Hz. Shouldn't I expect 1000hz?

So, things are different in ROS2. It seems that /clock indeed publishes at 10 Hz. You can find the answer to your question here.
