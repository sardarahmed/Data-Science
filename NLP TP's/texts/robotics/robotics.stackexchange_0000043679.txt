Q:

unmet dependency on eigen for vision-opencv, now can't install or upgrade any fuerte packages

I  tried to install vision-opencv today, and get failed dependencies due to a newer version of eigen3 (actually orocos depends on eigen, and geometry depends on orocos, and then vision-opencv depends on geometry). how can i resolve this? uninstalling eigen does not help as I get the same error.  I tried uninstalling fuerte, but now cannot reinstall fuerte due to the same error.

A:

This looks like the repo got into an inconsistent state.  It should be cleared up by now?
