Q:

ImportError: No module named yaml with run_chroot_local (jenkins-script) fails

Trying out run_chroot_local, I get the following error (full log):
$ run_chroot_local precise amd64 /home/rospasta/catkinws prerelease groovy openhrp3
  - ubuntu distro:  precise
  - architecture:   amd64
  - script:         prerelease
  - workspace:      /home/rospasta/catkinws

I first suspected that python's path wasn't set right, but other modules seem to be previously imported without an issue. Looking at this thread I now feel like looking into pbuilder but does anyone already have any idea? Thanks.

A:

You have errors above. It looks like you are missing some dependencies on your local machine. Potentially apt-show-versions
 /usr/bin/chroot_create.sh: line 32: apt-show-versions: command not found
    + REPOSTAMP=
    + /bin/echo 'Repo stamp is '
    Repo stamp is
    + '[' 0 '!=' ']'
    /usr/bin/chroot_create.sh: line 36: [: 0: unary operator expected
