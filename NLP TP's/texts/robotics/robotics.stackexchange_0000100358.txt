Q:

How to install ROS2 on Ubuntu 20.04 with WSL?

Hello,
I am running on windows 10 and I have installed Ubuntu 20.04 through the WSL environment. Now I want to install ROS2 on the Ubuntu. Which of the two processes should I follow?

Install ROS2 for Linux via Debian packages, since I can use the Ubuntu app download from the WSL, or
Install ROS2 for Windows, since my background OS is Windows?

Which is the safest choice to install ROS2 with my setup? Any feedback is appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

A:

WSL2 (WSL1 is different) runs Linux inside a VM.
So you should follow the regular Linux-based install tutorial for your version of Linux.
As you mention Ubuntu, that would be the Ubuntu based install tutorials.

Install ROS2 for Windows, since my background OS is Windows?

Inside WSL, there is no Windows. It's all Linux.
You only install ROS 2 using the Windows guides if you intend to write Windows applications using ROS 2. Those don't involve Linux, so no ROS-for-Linux.

Ok, that makes it clear. First time I work with VM and I was a bit confused. Thanks!
