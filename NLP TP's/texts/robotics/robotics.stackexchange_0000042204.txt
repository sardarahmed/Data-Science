Q:

Extending the ompl_ros_interface

While looking through the OMPL documentation I found a bunch of interesting features, such as planning in control space and creating custom (problem-specific) state samplers.
Are these features (Is access to these features) already implemented in the ompl_ros_interface and I just didn't find them?
If not, are there plans to integrate them?

FYI, I argue that the above question is a superset of http://answers.ros.org/question/38338/how-to-do-ompl-planners-benchmarking-inside-ros/

A:

At this point only functionality from the geometric:: namespace from OMPL is exposed in ompl_ros_interface. This will continue to be the case for a while.
