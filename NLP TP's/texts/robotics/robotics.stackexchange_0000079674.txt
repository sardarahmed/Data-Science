A:

edit: I've been working through this on my beaglebone board throughout the day and actually couldn't push this all the way through. I'm going to leave my earlier reply in case it's helpful to someone, but it was easier for me to just upgrade my distro to jessie and just install kinetic...

I believe the problem here is that the ros install depends on c++11 features which are not available on your device. I solved this exact problem (on a beagleebone running wheezy) by adding this flag to the build command:
--cmake-args -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=--std=c++0x
I also needed to upgrade my boost library to 1.53 to get the entire install to complete. See http://yplam.com/ros/2017/03/19/edison-ros-install.html as well

Do you mean boost 1.53 ?
Comment by emef on 2017-03-31:
yep, fixed

What was the build command that you added this flag to?
Comment by emef on 2017-03-31:
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/indigo
