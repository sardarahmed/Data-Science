Q:

depthimage_to_laserscan Asus xtion, Use centre pixels?

I would like to set my depth camera to use the centre pixels for the laser scan as the scan currently uses the bottom pixels so I have to tilt the camera which is causing inaccurate depth  measurements.
Could I create a camera_info.yaml file and indicate the region of interest (roi)? If so How is there any example of this being done?
Your help will be highly appreciated.
