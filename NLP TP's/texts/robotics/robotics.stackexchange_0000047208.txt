Q:

Spawn multiple objects in gazebo

Hi there,
I'm recently started with ROS and now I'm trying to work with the gazebo simulator.
My question: How can a spawn an object, for example the blue box in the gazebo tutorials, more than one time (on different positions)?

A:

In gazebo you can re-use the same urdf to spawn the same object at different places by using different model names.
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -urdf -file box.urdf -model box1 -x 1.0 -y 1.0 -z 1.0

rosrun gazebo spawn_model -urdf -file box.urdf -model box2 -x 4.0 -y 4.0 -z 1.0
