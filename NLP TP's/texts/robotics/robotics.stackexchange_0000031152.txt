Q:

How to write a rviz plugin

Hi ros answers,
I was wondering about how to add plugins to rviz. I read on the wiki that it was not documented on purpose as there is no stable API. But i would like to take a look at how it is done. Where should I start ?
Thank you.
Guido

There's not a released API at the moment.  For a discussion in the future, I suggest following up on this ros-developers posting
