Q:

cant install ROS on VirtualBox/Ubuntu 12.04

Hello.
I've tried to install ROS for the last two days, followed a few guides, tried to type in the installation commands in the ubuntu terminal a thousand times.
I have virtualbox installed I have the extension packages installed I have installed ubuntu 12.04 I have checked: mail, universe, restricted and multiverse in the software sources and unchecked the installable cd/dvd. I have updated in terminal by executing the sudo apt-get update command
everytime I enter this command: "the normal installation command"
Nothing happens, just a new line with: ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ starts.
I cant post webadresses..
Another isues I also have is my keyboard has all the special signs like: _/(=&/Â¤*^" etc. swicted around, so I have to guess where they know are hidding even through I have my own country keyboard layout configurated, so what can that be all about?
Im so frustrated right now, so hope somebody can help me, I have tried google alot without any concrete help.
Best regards.

Please check the support guidelines: http://ros.org/wiki/Support to get useful help. You need to give some concrete information what you tried to do and what failed.

A:

If you are following the guide at: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu
It is important that you follow all steps and in the right order. You are missing some, e.g. the apt-get update. If you follow each step, everything should go well. If there are errors, please report them here including the commands you issued.
