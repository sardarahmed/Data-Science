Q:

ubuntu 16.04 (xenial) package for gazebo 7.4.0?

I understand there are several bugs in 7.0.0 (for instance this one) which hve been fixed in later versions like 7.4.0 and 7.5.0. Are there any PPA's which include a prebuilt version of 7.4.0 or do I need to build from source? Thanks,
philip

A:

I'm running 16.04 (in VMWare, even) and the installed version of Gazebo is 7.5:
$ dpkg-query -W | grep gazebo
gazebo7 7.5.0-1~xenial

What does apt-cache madison gazebo7 show? (Interestingly, running that just now to test it showed me that I have a pending upgrade to Gazebo 7.6 waiting). Have you previously pinned Gazebo to version 7.0.0?

I have not pinned versions of anything on my system.
$ apt-cache madison gazebo7
gazebo7 | 7.0.0+dfsg-2 | http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages
gazebo | 7.0.0+dfsg-2 | http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe Sources

This appears to agree with http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/xenial/gazebo
"Source Package: gazebo (7.0.0+dfsg-2) [universe]"

I can see the problem now. My 7.6 package is coming from the OSRF repository. See the "alternative installation" instructions on this page: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu
