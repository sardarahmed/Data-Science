Q:

how to create my own ros controller

Hi,  I want to create cartesian position controller, but I did not find any documentation or example code.
I've seen that page http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control it didn't help me.
I use the kinetic distribution.
Does someone know how to do it?

A:

During a workshop a few years ago, we implemented a simple ros_control cartesian velocity controller taking Twist messages as input. While not exactly what you're asking for, it should provide some useful inspiration: https://github.com/johmau85/tedusar_manipulation/blob/master/tedusar_cartesian_controller/src/cartesian_controller.cpp
