Q:

Pocketsphinx - specify a language model

I installed pocketsphinx, but I don't know how to use it. I try to run python script:
rosrun pocketsphinx recognizer.py

and have the following output:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1395053854.598681] Please specify a language model file or a fsg grammar file. 

What shall I do? How can I specify this model?

A:

You indeed need to build a language model.
Go to CMU Sphinx tutorial page for this. There is also a web tool which is very helpful in this Language model web service.
The tutorial explains further instructions on how to convert and use the model

Thank you! I found language model from Voxforge and tried to run recognizer.py with parameters -dict /home/sphinx/msu_ru_nsh.dic -lm /home/sphinx/msu_ru_nsh.lm.dmp . But nothing changed. The output of command showed me that pocketsphinx already uses wsj model, but if there exists any model, why the error I noticed appears always?
