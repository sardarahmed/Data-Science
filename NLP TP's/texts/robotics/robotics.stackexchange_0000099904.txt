Q:

ros2 topic echo is not visible as node named _ros2cli_

Hi,
I was following https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Tutorials/Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html . I called command (I can see msg in terminal, so subscription is working):
ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel

and after that I typed:
vagrant@vagrant:~$ ros2 node list -a

output was:
/_ros2cli_daemon_0
/rqt_gui_py_node_3242
/teleop_turtle
/turtlesim

My question is were is
ros2cli<_id> node subscribed to /turtle1/cmd_vel topic ?
My env details:
uname -a
Linux vagrant 5.4.0-81-generic #91-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jul 15 19:09:17 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

env | grep ROS
ROS_VERSION=2
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0
ROS_DISTRO=galactic
