Q:

How to specify map topic for ros navigation static_layer (global costmap)?

Hello,
I have a /map topic where I have my initial map launched by map_server. But I want to change the topic for the map to /filtered_map. I want to do it because I make some restrictions on the map and publish a new map to another topic.
How can I change the map topic for navigation stack (global costmap)?
Thank you in advance!

A:

If you have specified your costmap layers using the hydro+ API, you can set the map_topic parameter under the static_map plugin namespace in your navigation configuration files. See the staticmap page for more information.
You can learn more about the hydro version of the costmap_2d stack here
This would often get placed in the costmap_common_parameters.yaml file in a hydro setup.  You can see an example of that here on a branch I have worked on.
Note that in the above case, you would add the following lines to the costmap_common_params.yaml file:
static_layer:
    map_topic: /map_filtered

because the staticmap plugin was specified to be in the static_layer namespace in the global_costmap_params.yaml file on the same branch.
