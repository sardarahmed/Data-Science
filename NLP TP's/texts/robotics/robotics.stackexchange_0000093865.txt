Q:

RViz POINTS color bug or doing something wrong

Hey,
I am using RViz to visualize some processed point cloud data. I am using visualization_msgs::Marker::POINTS.
According to tutorials I should be able to do something like this.
visualization_msgs::Marker points;
points.type = visualization_msgs::Marker::POINTS;
points.color.a = 1.0;
points.color.r = 1.0;

or using colors:
std_msgs::ColorRGBA col;
col.a = 1.;
col.r = 1.;
points.colors.push_back(col);

However, none of these two approaches seems to be working. All I get are white points. No change regarding the color.
I just wanted to ask you if I am doing something wrong or it is indeed a bug. (Ubuntu 18.04 - Melodic)

Well yes. Is my issue I created today, because I found out even tutorials are not working. The moment they approve it is bug I will post response here.

A:

It was caused by using Nouveau driver instead of proprietary nVidia driver. After switching, everything seems to be working.
