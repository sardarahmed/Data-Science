Q:

nodelet xml file not installed

I created a CMakeLists.txt to compile pointcloud_to_laserscan for groovy.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.4.6)
project(pointcloud_to_laserscan)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
            roscpp  nodelet sensor_msgs pcl_ros
             dynamic_reconfigure)
# PCL (do NOT use 1.7)
find_package(PCL 1.6 EXACT REQUIRED)
include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})             
             
#generate cfg 
generate_dynamic_reconfigure_options(cfg/CloudScan.cfg)
# Use this to define what the package will export (e.g. libs, headers).
catkin_package(
#   INCLUDE_DIRS include
#   LIBRARIES pointcloud_to_laserscan
   LIBRARIES cloud_to_scan
   CATKIN_DEPENDS nodelet roscpp pluginlib)

##############################################################################
# Binaries
##############################################################################
add_library(cloud_to_scan
            src/cloud_to_scan.cpp src/cloud_throttle.cpp
            )
target_link_libraries(cloud_to_scan 
                      ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${PCL_LIBRARIES} )
install(TARGETS cloud_to_scan
        RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
        LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
    )

I installed it with this command
catkin_make_isolated --pkg pointcloud_to_laserscan -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=true --install  --install-space /opt/ros/groovy

When I use the associated launch file, the following message appears:
   [ERROR] [1411833572.330693140]: Skipping XML Document "/opt/ros/groovy/share/pointcloud_to_laserscan/nodelets.xml" which had no Root Element.  This likely means the XML is malformed or missing.

Does it mean that I have to copy the file ?

A:

You have to explicitly specify which files should be installed in your CMakeLists.txt file (assuming the file specifying your nodelet is calles nodelets.xml and is beside the CMakeLists.txt file):
install(
  FILES nodelets.xml
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}
)

perfect. I thought it was handled somewhere by catkin, like package.xml
