Q:

How to install sicktoolbox in Kinetic?

Hello, I am trying to install sicktoolbox and sicktoolbox_wrapper in Kinetic, and am hitting a wall on building dependencies and compiling the driver. Could you please let me know what I am doing wrong?
Here are the steps I am taking:

sicktoolbox download – The home page for this package is (https://wiki.ros.org/sicktoolbox), and the download location is: (https://github.com/ros-drivers/sicktoolbox/tree/catkin). I made sure to download the ‘catkin’ version.
sicktoolbox_wrapper download – The home page for this package is (https://wiki.ros.org/sicktoolbox_wrapper), and the download location is: (https://github.com/ros-drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper/tree/revert-6-kinetic-devel). I made sure to download the ‘revert-6-kinetic-devel’
I unzipped the downloaded packages, and placed them into Desktop/workspace/src/.
I rename the folders “sicktoolbox-catkin” to “sicktoolbox”, and “sicktoolbox_wrapper-revert-6-kinetic-devel” to “sicktoolbox_wrapper”. If I don’t rename the directories and continue with the original names, roscd in step 8 does not find the packages.
I navigate to Desktop/workspace and execute catkin_make. Everything runs, everything looks happy to me. The only item that is suspicious is CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:166 (message): catkin_package() DEPENDS on 'Threads' but neither 'Threads_INCLUDE_DIRS' nor 'Threads_LIBRARIES' is defined.. But even so, it’s only a warning.
Next I execute source devel/setup.bash
I confirm that the environment is ok with echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and the results are: /home/brains/Desktop/workspace/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share.
I use tab completion on roscd sicktoolbox and am offered sicktoolbox/ and sicktoolbox_wrapper/. I am able to use roscd to enter both directories.
Everything looks ok, and now I am finally ready to follow the sicktoolbox_wrapper tutorial (found here: https://wiki.ros.org/sicktoolbox_wrapper/Tutorials/UsingTheSicklms). The first step in tutorial is to get the dependencies and compiling the driver and rviz. However as soon as I execute rosdep install sicktoolbox_wrapper rviz I get the error: ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies: sicktoolbox_wrapper: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [sicktoolbox]

I did look over the readme file inside sicktoolbox_wrapper (located here: https://github.com/ros-drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper/commit/0339280d56ecf24a496882efca08db95dd752783), but it does not mention running $ rosdep install sicktoolbox_wrapper rviz or rosmake sicktoolbox_wrapper rviz, which does not seem to make sense to me (I am pretty new to programming and ROS).
I am pretty new, and am having a really hard time installing this package, which is super critical to me. I searched for the error online, and read all the related questions and tutorials I could find, and am still stuck. Could you please suggest how to install sicktoolbox driver in Kinetic?
Thanks in advance.

A:

To make everything work, follow all the steps up to step 8 (and including step 8) in the question above. Then run these two commands:
$ rosdep install sicktoolbox rviz
$ rosmake sicktoolbox rviz
and voila, the sicktoolbox driver installs, and I confirmed that this actually works. Now I can get past step 1 in the sicktoolbox_wrapper tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/sicktoolbox_wrapper/Tutorials/UsingTheSicklms). someone should update that tutorial as I suspect it no longer applies to Kinetic.
