Q:

Problem with navigation stack

Hi 
I'm using the navigation stack to move my robot. I defined the tf between /map and /odom and the tf between /odom and /base_link so my tf tree respects the ROS convention.
But when I launch move_base.launch I get this warning:

[ WARN] [1346331439.052407413]: Waiting on transform from /base_link
to /map to become available before
running costmap, tf error:

How can I solve it?

A:

This can mean that you localization is not working. How did you define the transformation between /odom and /map? Are you running amcl localization and a robot? Or are you working in simulation?

I'm working on a real robot and I'm running AMCL localization. The transformations should be defined in the right way because the TF display status is OK and also the tf tree is displayed in the correct way.
