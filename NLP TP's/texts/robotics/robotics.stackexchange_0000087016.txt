Q:

where is the command roscd

I've installed ROS from source successfully and the command roscd works as expected.
Now I want to execute roscd in a bash script but get the error: roscd: not found
I've tried to find the command roscd but I got nothing: the output of find / -name roscd is empty.

A:

Have you completed the installation instructions? Namely, the environment setup section? From that section

It's convenient if the ROS environment variables are automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched:

echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Just make sure to change the kinetic portion to whatever version you installed.

Note: @jayess links to the regular (ie: binary) installation instructions, but environment setup is shared between from-source and binary installations.
