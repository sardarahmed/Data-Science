Q:

Aldebaran NAO Cross-Compilation. I can´t generate rostoolchain files

Hi:
I am following this tutorial for Nao robot and cross compilation ( http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao/Tutorials/Cross-Compiling )
After installation of ROS-Base electric from source, no rostolchain file appears into my installation dir subfolders. I have followed procedure in this link ( electric/Installation/Ubuntu/Source ) modified like that:
rosinstall $TARGETDIR/ros/electric "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=electric&variant=ros-base&overlay=no"
I could not follow step 4 in Cross-Compiling tutorial. I see that maybe the procedure for installing ros electric has changed and finally in   ´´/media/external/ros/electric¨ only appear: common_rosdeps  ros  ros_comm  setup.bash  setup.sh  setup.zsh
Maybe I have to build a toolchain by using eros?
Thanks.

A:

just past the contents of the box in the wiki page into your terminal. It will generate a rostoolchain.cmake file
