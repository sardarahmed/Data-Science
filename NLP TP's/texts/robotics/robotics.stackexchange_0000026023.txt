Q:

Coordinates within Model/Mesh

Hi,
is there any possibility to check whether certain coordinates are within a given model or not? Can I somehow build up an occupancy grid of model ?
Any help would be great?

A:

The closest thing you can do is probably by using ray casting.
This section of the tutorial does something similar to create a collision map.
You can also use the World::GetEntityBelowPoint() function
