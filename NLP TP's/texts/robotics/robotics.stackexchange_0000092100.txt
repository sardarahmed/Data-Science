Q:

How to rosdep install dependencies of one package?

Given a catkin workspace topology that looks like this...
/tmp/foobar_catkin_ws.Nxg25I
`-- src
    |-- bar
    |   |-- CMakeLists.txt
    |   |-- inc
    |   |   `-- bar
    |   |       `-- bar.hpp
    |   |-- package.xml
    |   `-- src
    |       `-- bar.cpp
    `-- foo
        |-- CMakeLists.txt
        |-- inc
        |   `-- foo
        |       `-- foo.hpp
        |-- package.xml
        `-- src
            `-- foo.cpp

9 directories, 8 files

...where foo depends on bar, how do I install the dependencies for foo but not bar?
I already know I can install the dependencies for all packages in a catkin workspace with
rosdep install \
    --from-path /tmp/foobar_catkin_ws.Nxg25I \
    --ignore-src

But this is too much for my purposes.

Does this not work for you:
rosdep install \
    --from-path /tmp/foobar_catkin_ws.Nxg25I/foo \
    --ignore-src

It won't work if bar is a dependency of foo but otherwise seems to do what you ask.
Comment by rubicks on 2019-06-18:
Assume that foo depends on bar; and yes, it doesn't work.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-18:
Well that would have been good to include in your question.
Comment by rubicks on 2019-06-18:
@gvdhoorn, fixed per your suggestion

A:

It's a bit ugly (and there is probably a combination of options that achieves the same effect), but the following checks only the dependencies of foo, not bar, but does recognise bar as a dependency of foo:
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/tmp/foobar_catkin_ws.Nxg25I/src:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH \
  rosdep check -i foo

At least on my system.
None of the dependencies of bar will be checked in this example. Normally that would result in a potentially non-building workspace, but I believe that is what you asked for.

I have some preliminary indications that I can duplicate your technique. If there is still no answer after I hone the scripts using this trick, I'll add whatever I have working. Thanks very much, @gvdhoorn.

I have a feeling you're not giving us all the details, especially given your earlier questions. Without all pertinent information we cannot help you.

@gvdhoorn, don't feel bad --- you've already helped so much!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-18:
I don't feel bad.
But I don't like xy-problems either. I'm not saying this is one, but it's impossible to know with the minimum amount of information you provide.

@rubicks: any updates?
Comment by rubicks on 2019-07-08:
Nothing that's better than what you have. I'm going to declare this one answered.
