Q:

ImportError: No module named controller_manager_msgs.srv on RRBot Ros_Control Example

Hi,
I have been trying to go through the rrbot_gazebo example, having made it as far as the section on control.
However I seem to be stuck at one point. Running the command
'roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch '
It is here that the spawner from catkin_ws/src/ros_control/controller_manager/scripts/spawner, fails giving an error
 File "/home/user/catkin_ws/src/ros_control/controller_manager/scripts/spawner", line 43, in <module> from controller_manager_msgs.srv import *
ImportError: No module named controller_manager_msgs.srv

I'm not sure why as the folder controller_manager/srv exists and contains numerous .srv files.
I have run catkin_make beforehand and everything runs / builds smoothly.
I'm on Ubuntu Raring, have installed ROS Hydro Quantal however, and Gazebo Quantal. But then again i see the same problem on another computer which has raring for everything.
Any possible Ideas? I understand that the RRBot example is in flux due to Hydro, so is incomplete, but any help is appreciated.
Cdr

A:

Try:
git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_controllers.git

From you catkin/src folder.
And catkin_make again after.
You will also probably need:
git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/control_toolbox.git
git clone https://github.com/ros-controls/realtime_tools.git

Thanks, I think I had them at the time but didn't catkin_make, or possibly forgot to add source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash to bash.src
