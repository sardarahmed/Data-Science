Q:

Permission Denied Autoware Docker

O Learned Denizens,
This is the same question as here but the answer there - to do with groups - isn't working for me.
Launching autoware/autoware:1.13.0-melodic
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.

I am in a group called docker that I created doing
sudo group add docker

...and added myself using
sudo usermod -aG docker damian

...which apparently succeeded:
damian@UbuntiBookPro:~$ groups
damian adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin lxd sambashare docker

What's next on the list to try?

After you added yourself to the docker group, did you either restart or log out and back in? Changes to groups don't apply until you do one of these.

A:

Logging out and in again didn't do it, but restarting did. Thanks!
