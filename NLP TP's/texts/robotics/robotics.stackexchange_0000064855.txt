Q:

Problems with robotino_node when using roslaunch

Hello,
When I run roslaunch robotino_node robotino_node.launch, I get the following output which indicates that robotino_node & robotino_odometry_node are missing (when I look in robotino-ros-pkg/robotino_node/bin, there too they are missing):

A:

I had checked out robotino-ros-pkg from svn and run 'rosmake robotino'. This is when I got the aforementioned error. But I managed to solve it by excluding all occurrences of KinectROS.cpp which was causing the problems. So now when i run 'rosmake robotino', it generates all executables.
