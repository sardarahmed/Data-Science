Q:

Simulation pr2_controller_manager

I'm trying thia pr2s tutorial : Teleop PR2 arm in simulation (http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/Teleop%20PR2%20arm%20in%20simulation)
when i put the line: roslaunch jtteleop.launch
the error is :
 Failed to load r_cart 

in the .launch is here
....
<node name="spawn_cart"
       pkg="pr2_controller_manager" type="spawner"
       args="r_cart" />

I suppose that the pr2_controller_manager was missing in my deps ... but i tried
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-mechanism
http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_controller_manager
but the error always is the same
Tried change the type in the .launch and doesn't work
<rosparam ns="r_cart">

    type: robot_mechanism_controllers/JTCartesianControll
    root_name: torso_lift_link

Next Error is
 Could not load controller 'r_cart' because controller type 'robot_mechanism_controllers/JTCartesianControll' does not exist

i don't know what i'm doing wrong ... i'm just keep few weeks Workin On Ros ..

A:

You have a typo in the controller name. It should be robot_mechanism_controllers/JTCartesianController, not  robot_mechanism_controllers/JTCartesianControll.
