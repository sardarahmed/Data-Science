Q:

Read XML file from cpp

Hello,
I have a .xml file, which I need to read.
Searching in Internet, I saw that I could do that with MSXML. But I can't include the library in my program.
Anyone knows how I can do that?
Or is there a other way to read a XML file?
Thanks

A:

I'd recommend using TinyXML as it is already used by several important packages in ROS (e.g. URDF, rviz, rospack). For an example of how to use TinyXML in compilation, check out the CMakeLists.txt file from the kdl_parser package. A relatively self-contained example of how to read an xml file is in their kdl_parser.cpp file.
