Q:

Unable to display Mesh as an interactive marker

I want to use a mesh as a marker.
To do that, I changed basic_controls.py to :
marker.type = Marker.MESH_RESOURCE;
marker.mesh_resource = 'package://HexagonalPrism.STL'

(And added a from visualization_msgs.msg import * at the top as well)
I get the following error
Error retrieving file [package://HexagonalPrism.STL]: Could not parse package:// format into file:// format

The same works fine if I do a simple marker:
marker = visualization_msgs.msg.Marker()
marker.type = visualization_msgs.msg.Marker.MESH_RESOURCE
marker.mesh_resource = 'package://HexagonalPrism.STL'

A:

The file format is 'package://' + name_of_package + '/' + filename_in_package
For example, if you have HexagonalPrism.STL in the package hexbot, the syntax should be 'package://hexbot/HexagonalPrism.STL'. If its in a folder called meshes in that package, 'package://hexbot/meshes/HexagonalPrism.STL'

Thanks for the quick help. But it still doesn't work.
Here's the code. Just minor changes from the visualization_tutorials

You have to be more specific than "doesn't work"

Oh sorry, I don't get the error I wrote in the question, but RViz still looks like https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-PFIKJ4nKIuMVdzd3AtekNXYUk/view

Check the filenames carefully, especially dae vs stl.
Comment by ratneshmadaan on 2015-07-05:
There are both dae and stl files here. https://github.com/madratman/visualization_tutorials/tree/indigo-devel/interactive_marker_tutorials_local/meshes
I tried stl as well. No change. :\
