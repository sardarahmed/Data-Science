Q:

Arduino DUE + CMake with rosserial_arduino

Hello all,
What is the board name I should use for BOARD?
The following does not work.
generate_arduino_firmware(due_project
  SRCS due_project.cpp ${ROS_LIB_DIR}/time.cpp
  BOARD due
  PORT /dev/ttyACM0
)

I have installed DUE related stuff in IDE by Tools -> Boards Manager. I just want the arduino things to be built using catkin just like other packages. Also, I noticed that /home/peshala/arduino-1.6.5-r5/hardware/arduino/avr/boards.txt does not contain an entry for "due".
Thank you.
CS

The due is not an avr processor, it will be under sam.

@tonybaltovski ok I understand. So, what modifications should I make to compile and upload to DUE as in link text

A:

hello i work for me with arduino1.6.8
i change in ros_lib the file ArduinoHardware.h
#if defined(USBCON) and !(defined(USE_USBCON))
/* Leonardo support */
iostream = &Serial1;
to
#if defined(USBCON) and !(defined(USE_USBCON))
/* Leonardo support */
iostream = &Serial;
