Q:

How to check the installed rosserial version

Hi everyone,
Does anyone had any idea about how to check the rosserial version in the Ubuntu Kinetic? Because currently I'm trying to use rosserial to communicate with mbed, Due to some errors, the serial port will read failure.
Hope anyone can give some suggestion to help me. Thank you!

My bad, it seems that rosversion does not work for metapackages, so you would want to use rosversion rosserial_arduino or one of the other rosserial packages you might be using.
