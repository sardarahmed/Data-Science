Q:

MoveIt fails to control arm, no arm_controller action client

Hi, I am using the hydro-devel branch of the universal_robot package to attempt to control a UR-5. I start move_group and moveit_rviz and rviz loads properly and displays the correct current state of the arm. I am also able to plan movements for the arm properly, however, every time I try to execute those planned movements, this shows up in moveit's terminal window:
EDIT: (text would not show up properly, here is a pastebin link: pastebin.com/e0VGVdFU )
it appears as though I do not have arm_controller either installed or initialized properly, and I have not been able to find any information relating to the installation or setup of this package.

A:

This has come up before, and I think the UR instructions / documentation could do with some work. In any case, this recent discussion on the mailinglist should provide you with enough information to get things working: Universal Robots UR5 & UR10 packages.
