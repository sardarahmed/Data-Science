A:

While a verb like cd can easily be contributed to the ros2cli tools the question is what should the semantic of that command be? In ROS 1 when using the devel space it brought you to the source folder of a package. In ROS 2 there is no concept of a devel space and after installing a package there is no correlation to the source space anymore. So the only possible location to switch to would be the install prefix of the package or the location where the package manifest is (in the subfolder share/<pkgname> in the install space). I am just not sure how useful that would be...
Update:
The ros2 command is only available after installation and at that time the source code of packages is potentially not available anymore (and also its location is generally not known). Therefore I created a colcon specific shell function named colcon_cd which only operates on the filesystem and doesn't utilize any installed ROS workspace. The PR for this functionality is here: https://github.com/colcon/colcon-cd/pull/1 Please feel free to comment / provide feedback on how it works for you - I am probably not a good tested of this functionality since I have never used roscd in the first place.
