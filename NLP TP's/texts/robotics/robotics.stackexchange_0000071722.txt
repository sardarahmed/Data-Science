Q:

Missing Smokie Robot - URDF file from ROS, MoveIt!

Hi!
In the Smokie -MoveIt ROS tutorial
( http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/OUR/MoveIt%20Setup%20Assistant%20for%20OUR%20robot)
says that you need to load the OUR-II.URDF file, which I can not find!!
Does anyone has this file (OUR-I.URDF is also good!)
Thank you in advance!

A:

I would suggest you take this up with OUR themselves. wiki.ros.org/Robots/OUR points to LMNcnu/OUR_6DoFs, which has an issue tracker.
