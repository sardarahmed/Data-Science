Q:

ROS Lunar on Ubuntu 17.10?

Has anyone successfully run ROS Lunar on Ubuntu 17.10?  If so, I'd be grateful for instructions on how to do it. Many thanks.

Related questions: #q262187 (discusses Kinetic on 17.04, but conceptually the same), #q274615.

A:

Officially this is not supported, so there are no binary packages available (but you are probably already aware of this, see also REP-3).
A source install could be possible, but is not guaranteed to work, as dependencies may have changed between Zesty and Artful. As for instructions: see wiki/lunar/Installation/Source (replace occurences of zesty in commands with artful where needed).

Edit: as I was curious myself, I just did this in an Artful Docker container. I basically followed the Lunar source instructions (so for 17.04), but had to make some minor changes to some commands.
As rosdep doesn't have any artful entries yet, pretend it's really zesty (under Resolving dependencies) (added the --skip-keys to avoid trying to reinstall rosdep again):
rosdep install --from-paths src -i --rosdistro=lunar --os ubuntu:zesty -y --skip-keys="python-rosdep"

To be able to install shiboken2 and related pkgs, add the OSRF repositories following the instructions (artful appears to be missing dirmngr, which made apt-key fail, so install it dirmngr with apt (see also #q275824 and #q264654)).
After that I could follow the regular instructions again.
The build is still running, so I don't know whether it works, but it would seem to at least compile for now.

Edit2: build just finished, no really significant problems afaict. roscore started, but haven't tested anything else.

Edit3: after building, you probably want to add export ROS_OS_OVERRIDE=ubuntu:17.04:zesty to your .bashrc (or similar file). At least until rosdep gets its rules updated for artful.

Many thanks for your answer and for testing it out.  I will give it a go.  It will give me an excuse to finally do something with Docker too.

Dockerfile that worked for me: gist.

Hey, Hi it is giving me opencv error, how can I exclude opencv from make, it is really urgent
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-01-24:
This is a regular "ROS from source" installation - just on an unsupported OS - so excluding packages would be done the same way as always.

I was able to build but the final error before exit is  on this lines
COPY ./ros_entrypoint.sh \
ENTRYPOINT ["/ros_entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["bash"]
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-01-24:
ros_entrypoint.sh is standard file in all ROS Docker images, see osrf/docker_images/ros/indigo/ubuntu/trusty/ros-core/ros_entrypoint.sh.
