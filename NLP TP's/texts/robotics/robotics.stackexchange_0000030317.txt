Q:

Timer callbacks not working

Previously working timers in some of my packages/nodes have stopped working. The roscpp_tutorials/Tutorials/Timers example doesn't work either as the timer callbacks never execute. The program aborts normally with ctrl-C from the spin function.
I am using Ubuntu 10.04, Diamondback and an Acer AX3400 (AMD Athlon II). Internet searches haven't uncovered any other examples of this problem. Hints?

A:

Yes! Bhaskara, your suggestion was very insightful.
I have been keeping fairly comprehensive notes during development and one of the last things I did before the problem occurred most recently was: "roslaunch erratic_description erratic_laser_wg_world.launch". I then killed the processes with ctrl-C from the terminal, but the nodes still show up in rxGraph as failed. Executing "rosnode cleanup" doesn't seem to fix the timer problem.
Following up on your suggestion, "rosparam get /use_sim_time" showed TRUE. "rosparam set /use_sim_time false" corrected the timer problem.
Thanks again for your suggested solution to an issue that could have continued to tease me for quite some time. (and may your karma points increase substantially)
