Q:

how to monitor the node's state?

Here is the problem, I have several nodes running together ,and they should work well for a long time. But, I'm not sure wheather they will break or not . So,is there anything can be used to   monitor the state of the nodes ? if one broke up,it can show something or inform there are something wrong.
