Q:

PointCloud2 not organized

I'm reading PointCloud2 sensor messages from a robot in Gazebo. However, the point cloud given by the message is always unorganized (width=307200, height=1). In the urdf file, the size of the image is set to 640x480. Is there some way to guarantee organization?
At the moment, my code does the "reorganization" of the cloud manually (using a for loop).

A:

It may not be supported. It's recommended to ask gazebo questions on answers.gazebosim.org

Manual reorganization of the point cloud seems to be working fine, and it is only a few lines of code.

@atp, I am facing the same problem. How did you convert the unorganized point cloud to organized point cloud? Does the cloud follow row-major order?
