Q:

infinite "node restart" when using roslaunch

Using rosrun my node ends normally, but roslaunching it I get an infinite auto-restart; after the return 0 on "int main" the node gets called forever. I tried to comment out the spinOnce call without success. Diamondback on ubuntu 10.10
Thank you!!

A:

Sounds like you are setting the respawn=true attribute in the launch file for that node.
