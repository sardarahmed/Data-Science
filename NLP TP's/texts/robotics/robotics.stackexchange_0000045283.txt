Q:

"No ROS_WORKSPACE set" - Problem

Hello,
I want to use roscd inside of my ros_workspace, without typing:

source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash

at first. In this tutorial is written:

It is very common to replace the line
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash to
source the setup.bash in
~/fuerte_workspace.

I suspect that this sentence is the solution.
Due to English is not my Motherlanguage I just dont get it what to do in order to use roscd instantly for all packages inside of my fuerte_workspace.
Can someone please give me an exact instruction to reach my goal?
Thanks in advance
Dominik

Hi, hopefully this helps you out.
From my personal experience (on Ubuntu) I've found that adding the following lines to my ~/.bashrc file keeps everything for me in working condition:
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
export ROS_WORKSPACE=~/ros_workspace

and in your case I think you would want it to be:
source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/fuerte_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
export ROS_WORKSPACE=~/fuerte_workspace

That should let you use roscd and other ros command line tools with your setup.

Did you meant the bash.bashrc file under /etc? Because I found 3 aditional files with bashrc in it. I could change this file (under /etc) only with root-permissions. But after modifying the file nothing changed.

It should not be necessary to set ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or ROS_WORKSPACE in your .bashrc. Try only "source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash", this should work as well.

Exactly this is the problem. I don't want to type this line everytime in a new console when i want to roscd a package out of my workspace. I know it must be possible (in another vmware image it is like that).

I think what KruseT was saying is that you don't need all the lines I put in there. Only the first. This goes in the file .bashrc in your user's home directory, which is what the prefix ~ means. Every time you open a new terminal, that will be loaded and you won't need to type it.
