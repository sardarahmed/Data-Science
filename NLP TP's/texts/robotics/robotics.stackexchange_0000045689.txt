Q:

image_raw and camera_info not synchronized in Wlan

Hi,
I am trying to send compressed depthimages over "/camera/depth/image_raw" topic using image_transport on Wlan. But even compressed they seem to be too big for the Wlan. The program subscribing the topic throws the warning "Topics 'camera/depth/image_raw/compressedDepth' and 'camera/depth/camera_info' do not appear to be synchronized. In the last 10s:
Image messages received: 142
CameraInfo messages received: 174
Sychronized pairs: 21"
How can I sychronize the messages. Is there a way to apply another time policy in image_topic without using message_filters or would using message_filters be the way to go?

A:

Have you tried to synchronize your messages with ApproximateTime in message filters ? It uses time stamps to synchronize two topics, even if they are slightly unsynchronised.

It is not, that they are really unsynchronised. The time is synchron, but my wireless is the bottleneck. More camera_info messages than actual image messages pass through. So somehow I have to use the ones where two messages are available and ignore the rest. Can message_filters do this?

Yes, this is precisely what the time synchronizer does.
