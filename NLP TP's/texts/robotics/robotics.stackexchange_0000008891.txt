Q:

Figure out PID values from drone specs

I have all the specs from a quadcopter, everthing, would it be possible to figure out the pid from those specs?

A:

Generally, no. You'd have to evaluate the system and do some system identification. The reason being that even though you know the specs, you don't know how the system will respond to perturbations or errors in manufacturing, etc. 
Once you've done some system identification to figure out response curves, you can tune the parameters using the guide in the comment (or here).  
Another method is to just fly it around a set point and observe its behavior, though I think that's not the best solution.
