Q:

Rosbags record parameter server data?

I am working with some rosbags, rosbag info shows that there are some dynamically reconfigurable parameters which i want to configure but these parameters are not shown when i use rosparam list.
In the documentation it was mentioned that rosbags  record data on the topics mentioned with rosbag record, so my question is-

Do rosbags record data other than the data they get by subscribing on the topics?

Specific information- I am using Ubuntu 16.04, ROS kinetic, the rosbags were taken from Velodyne VLP-16 LIDAR, I am not sure about the drivers/packages used with VLP-16 since i was only provided with the bags.

A:

ROS bags only record topics; they do not record parameters or service calls.
I'm not aware of any tools that can re-use the dynamic reconfigure topics that may be stored in a bag file.
