Q:

Kinect point cloud all white

I'm running ros hydro on ubuntu 12.04. The kinect's rgb camera is capturing color images, but the point cloud is all white.
This problem used to be occasional, and sometimes I'd have to power cycle the kinect and unplug/replug all its connections, then launch again and the point cloud would be normal. Now that's not working anymore.
I've tried using drivers openni_launch (1.9.5) and freenect_launch (0.3.2), but it doesn't make a difference. Ultimately I'd like to be using openni for compatibility with the openni skeleton tracker.
Has anyone seen this problem before? Is there a known solution? If not, what would you recommend as troubleshooting measures?
Update: This problem only happens with the PointCloud2. When viewing the DepthCloud in rviz, it's all color.

A:

Make sure you are not disabling depth registration. Depth registration registers colors to the depth points.
Try roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch depth_registration:=true.
Check the launch file used to launch the kinect and make sure it does not have a line like <arg name="depth_registration" value="false" /> in the openni_launch node.
