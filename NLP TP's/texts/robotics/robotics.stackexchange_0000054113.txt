Please, explain more detailed your problem in the description, not in the title of your question.

What distro of ROS are you using?

A:

There is a dot missing in the second tutorial.
From your workspace, run:  ~/catkin_ws$ ./devel/lib/testbot_description/parser ./src/testbot_description/urdf/my_robot.urdf
It worked for me.
