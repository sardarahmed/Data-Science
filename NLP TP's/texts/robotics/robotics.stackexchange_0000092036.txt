Q:

Generating 3D map from Lidar data

I have a rosbag file of Velodyne 64. My question is that how I can generate a 3D map from that rosbag file?

What have you tried so far? Is your lidar sensor moving? Do you have any other sensors in the rosbag as well? What sort of map do you need to generate?
We're happy to help, but you're going to have to give us a lot more information.

My lidar sensor is moving and I have only sensor information of Lidar sensor in rosbag and i wanted to generate map for autonomous driving and I have odometry information also.

A:

I tried 3D Localization and mapping using hdl_graph_slam. Just using the Lidar scan and odometry and I was able to localize the sensor.
