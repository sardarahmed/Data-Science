Q:

frontier exploration theory and usage

Hi,
I'm trying to understand how I can use the package frontier_exploration in order to use it for my project. I have studied the paper describing this theory by Yamauchi (1997). I would like to know whether this implementation of frontier exploration is based on the most basic theory (i.e. the greedy approach where the robot chooses its closest frontier) or whether some objective function is being used to decide upon the choice of the frontier to explore.
Thanks.
--EDIT:
When I tried to run the global_map.launch file and provided a polygon boundary + a start point, I got the following result:

Nothing worked and the exploration was not performed. The nodes that I am running include: rosAria (robot control), sicktoolbox_wrapper (laser driver), tf node, gmapping to build the map. Do i need to run some other node to perform actionlib?

A:

Currently, only the greedy approach is used. I am interested in moving to a plugin-based architecture to allow users to write their own cost function, but this is not currently implemented.

Ok thanks. I m trying to run the package through the launch file global_map.launch. I am running a Pioneer robot with rosAria and sicktoolbox_wrapper. I am using the gmapping node to build the map. Do I need to run anything else apart from these nodes in order for frontier_exploration to work?

I did not quite understand what needs to be done in Step 2: Submit a goal to the server with your own node via an actionlib SimpleActionClient. I am just running the frontier_exploration package but nothing happens when I select the starting position of the robot within the polygon boundary.

You can find end-to-end demo usage here https://github.com/husky/husky_navigation/blob/indigo-devel/launch/exploration_demo.launch

Does move_base package work on pioneer robots? i.e. any robot that works with the ROSARIA package for robot control? because my robot moves forward by publishing on the /RosAria/cmd_vel command and does not move when using move_base.

the navigation stack will work, but is going to require some configuration on your part. It's a whole separate can of worms http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials
