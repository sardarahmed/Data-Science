Q:

Boost error when building Fuerte on OS X mountain lion (10.8.1)

I am trying to install ROS Fuerte on Mac OS X mountain lion (10.8.1) as per the guide.
When I make ros-underlay/build I get this error. I tried to revert to boost 1.49.0 instead since some have had success with this, but it did not help.
Anyone got an idea how to solve this issue?

Edit: So I got past this error by adding Williams pull request for rostime/CMakeLists.txt
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS date_time thread system)

Had to also install libtool, autoconf and automake, which was not mentioned in the guide.
However, now I get a new error when doing brew install log4cxx
configure.in:338: the top level
configure.in:40: error: version mismatch.  This is Automake 1.12.3,
configure.in:40: but the definition used by this AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
configure.in:40: comes from Automake 1.9.6.  You should recreate
configure.in:40: aclocal.m4 with aclocal and run automake again.

Edit2:
brew --config returns

Edit3: Wow got it working, except for a small error when doing rosdep install -a in the guide. Other than that, I can now run roscore etc. Will update later when I get a better overview of what I did to get it to work.

Updated to reflect my progress. I got past the boost error by adding Williams pull request. Also, I updated boost to 1.50.0 with no issues.

The log4cxx error looks brew specific.  Have you checked the issue tracker for Homebrew on github.com to see if it has been reported? I am testing the log4cxx install on my machine right now.
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2012-09-12:
log4cxx builds successfully on my machine.  I do not have autoconf/automake/libtool installed and my xcode/clt version is 4.4.1
Comment by tropic on 2012-09-13:
I do not see any open issues for log4cxx on the homebrew issue tracker. What version do you have installed? I also have xcode 4.4.1.
Comment by tropic on 2012-09-13:
I removed autoconf/automake/libtool again with brew and now I get this again
./autogen.sh: line 23: glibtoolize: command not found
./autogen.sh: line 27: aclocal: command not found
./autogen.sh: line 28: autoconf: command not found
./autogen.sh: line 29: automake: command not found

What is the output of brew doctor?  This might be something you need to raise on the Homebrew issue tracker.  Make sure you review https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Bug-Fixing-Checklist before submitting a ticket to them.

This appears to be a duplicate of this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/43272/ros-install-problem-osx-1068/
There was a problem with a missing library dependency in rostime.  It has been fixed, but not in the version that the OSX install guide instructions download.  Try William's patch in the previous post.

Additionally, I'm not sure that any work on 10.8 has happened yet.  It may be worth it to hold off on updating for a bit until homebrew and ROS catch up to the new release.
Comment by david.hodo on 2012-09-11:
I don't know that it's officially supported and you might have better luck with Lion, but I'm running Fuerte on 10.8 right now without any major issues.  I've passed along the issues I ran into to William, but I'm not sure that it has all been incorporated upstream or into the guide.
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2012-09-11:
The patch in question has been merged and will be in the next release of roscpp_core.
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2012-09-11:
The new version of roscpp_core has been released I believe.
