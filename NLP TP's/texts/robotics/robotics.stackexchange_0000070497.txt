Q:

How to find out if prerelease test was successful?

Hi,
I have just ran prelease tests on my local machine with the commands generated on http://prerelease.ros.org.
prerelease.sh finished without any error prompt and the last output was
No test results in overlay workspace

Does it mean the test was successful? (In this case a final output like "Prelease Test finished successfully." would be more clearly ;) )
Or do I have to check for anything else?
Regards
Sabrina

A:

No test results in overlay workspace

IMO this particular line has nothing to do with the test result of your targetted package. The test result must have been printed way above of that line.
