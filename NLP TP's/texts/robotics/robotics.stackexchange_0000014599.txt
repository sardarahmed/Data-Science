Q:

Urdf as a way to model dynamics?

Since urdf format serves the purpose of kinematic model but also extends for dynamical properties such as mass,moment of inertia and centre of masses, can it be considered a viable dynamical model of a robot, comparable to standard methods such as Euler-Lagrange and Newton-Euler?

A:

No. URDF is a convenient way to format information about the model; it is not a model itself.
