Q:

Report issues about a header file in /opt/ros/kinetic/include

I recently found an issue in a file in /opt/ros/kinetic/include. Which issue tracker should I report the issue?
[Edit] Here is the issue
/opt/ros/kinetic/include/ros/serialization.h:234:5: runtime error: store to misaligned address 0x60600000aca4 for type 'double', which requires 8 byte alignment
0x60600000aca4: note: pointer points here
  30 00 00 00 be be be be  be be be be be be be be  be be be be be be be be  be be be be be be be be
              ^ 

The issue is detected when I am using Ubsan with turtlesim. Ubsan is a sanitizer for detecting undefined behavior. Many times misalignment is only a minor issue. But I am not sure if it is the case here.

Have a look at https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues

@zell which include file is the issue? It would be helpful to see the output of dpkg -S /opt/ros/kinetic/include/[specific file].

In addition to what @allenh1 writes, it would also be nice to know what the actual issue is.

@gvdhoorn See my update above.

@allenh1 With your suggested "dpkg -S ..." command, I got "ros-kinetic-roscpp-serialization: /opt/ros/kinetic/include/ros/serialization.h".

A:

@allenh1 With your suggested dpkg -S ... command, I got ros-kinetic-roscpp-serialization: /opt/ros/kinetic/include/ros/serialization.h.

In that case, the correct repo is here: https://github.com/ros/roscpp_core
If you know how to fix it, I'd encourage a PR instead of an issue!
