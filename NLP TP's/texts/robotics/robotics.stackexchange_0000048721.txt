Q:

rosws trouble creating sandbox

I just read this same question and the answer did not help.
I ran rosws init and created the groovy_workspace, then a mkdir to create sandbox and next I did the following:
bill@RobotDev:~$ source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
bill@RobotDev:~$ rosws set ~/groovy__workspace/sandbox
ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.
What am I missing?

A:

The answer is that after the making the directory groovy_workspace, you have to bill@RobotDev:~$ source ~/groovy_workspace/setup.bash
bill@RobotDev:~$ rosws set ~/groovy_workspace/sandbox
 Add new elements:

sandbox
Continue: (y)es, (n)o: y
Overwriting /home/bill/groovy_workspace/.rosinstall
Do not forget to do ...
$ source /home/bill/groovy_workspace/setup.sh
... in every open terminal.
