Q:

Profiling ros_controllers with Valgrind / Callgrind

Hi,
I'm trying to proifle my controllers written in the ros_control framework in Gazebo. To this end, I added the following argument in gazebo_ros/launch/empty_world.launch:
launch-prefix="valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=/home/user/callgrind.out" 
However, no output file is produced. Has anybody who tried profiling ROS controllers using the Valgrind/Callgrind toolchain a solution for this?
Thanks,
-Robert-
