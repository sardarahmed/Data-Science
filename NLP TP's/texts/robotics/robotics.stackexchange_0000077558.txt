Q:

How to send empty message from js to ros

I'm trying to use roslibjs and I want to try to send std_msgs/Empty for take_off or land, I tried to send like
takeOff.publish('std_msgs/Empty');
but I receive an error about missing the field

A:

Thank you, i figure it out, it is only
takeOff.publish();
Because it is empty message!

I would actually recommend to use a Service with the std_srvs/Trigger type. That communicates intent in a much more explicit way than std_msgs/Empty.
