Q:

Staubli TX2 with CS9 Controller

Hi,
I have a couple of Staubli TX2's, each with the CS9 Controller. Is it possible to have these working with ROS? I see that in Wiki, there is a VAL3 driver (https://github.com/ros-industrial/staubli_experimental/tree/kinetic-devel/staubli_val3_driver).
Has anyone controlled a TX2 with ROS?
Thanks,

A:

The staubli_val3_driver on the staubli_experimental repository is not compatible with CS9, but only due to the change from text interfaces to HTML-based that CS9 brings. Disabling the screenUpdate task brings it back into compatibility for the most part.
We are currently working on some improvements on the staubli_val3_driver, among them, CS9 compatibility, and -of course- would like to contribute it back to the repo once it's ready.

I've made this the accepted answer as, as of right now (2019-05-05), staubli_val3_driver is not compatible with CS9 controllers.
If/when @gonzalocasas contributs his changes this might change. I assume he'll update this answer if/when that happens.
