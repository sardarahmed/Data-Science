Q:

Topic/msg inspection tool

All,
I am coming to ROS as an LCM user.  One of the LCM tools that I found very useful was lcm-spy (http://lcm.googlecode.com/svn/www/manpages/lcm-spy.html). The tool provided a complete high-level view of all published messages and the ability to drill down at examine the content of individual messages.
I have tried to replicate this functionality with various command-line options to rostopic without any luck.  My suspicion is that this tool exists.
Thank you,
Briani

A:

From the man page you link:

lcm-spy collects the following statistics for each channel:

Channel name

This would be topic I guess in ROS: rostopic list / rosservice list (although those are not channels). If you want a GUI tool: rqt_graph.

Number of messages received

This is a bit trickier, and would need some bash scripting to keep a running total. Perhaps another member can suggest a suitable one-liner.

Message Rate (Hz)

rostopic hz /topic_name

Bandwidth (KB/s)

rostopic bw /topic_name

See also wiki/rostopic.
Note that these statistics are all relative to the start of a rostopic invocation.
You might also be interested in wiki/Topics - Topic statistics and rqt_graphprofiler.

Edit:

[..] and examine the content of individual messages.

That would be rostopic echo /topic_name. Be aware that this can result in a lot of data for high-frequency / high-volume topics.

Thank you for the recommendations.  It turns out what I was looking for was/is rqt_topic.  The other tools are useful.
Thank you!
