Q:

I cannot install libStaticMapPlugin.so file. How can i?

Hello,
I tried to create a world with satellite images using libStaticMapPlugin.
But i get an error like this:
[Err] [Plugin.hh:180] Failed to load plugin libStaticMapPlugin.so: libStaticMapPlugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
than i find the package which keeps plugins and cannot see static map plugin.
I use Gazebo 9 on Ubuntu 18.04
How can i install libStaticMapPlugin?

A:

Firstly, thanks for your answers.
I have already searched for the plugin in that folders but it was not exist.
@BillThePlatypus said "the plugin is for gazebo10" than i think the plugin doesn't exist on gazebo9
https://answers.gazebosim.org//question/23776/gazebo-static-map-plugin-not-loading/
but i saw the repo including the plugin with @Veerachart 's answer.
so, i expected, my system doesn't allowed to install packages from packages.osrfoundation.org.
i watched those steps to get plugin:
1.Setup my computer to accept software from packages.osrfoundation.org.
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable lsb_release -cs main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'

update packages

sudo apt-get update

tried to open gazebo but i have faced with a problem:

gazebo: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgazebo_common.so.9: undefined symbol: _ZN8ignition10fuel_tools12ClientConfig12SetUserAgentERKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE

upgraded the libraries with

sudo apt upgrade libignition-math2

than tried to run gazebo and it worked well

gazebo --verbose static_map_plugin.world
Thanks everyone, these are my experiences. I hope it can help others.
