Q:

What does rosawesome do?

It sounds like it must do something pretty awesome, yet I can't find any info on this mysterious executable inside ROS.
From inside rosbash;
function rosawesome {
    alias megamaid=rosrecord
    alias suck2blow=rosplay
    alias botherder=roscore
}

Wow... I never knew such a command existed in ROS and definitely it sounds awesome :) I'd follow this question to know what it does!
