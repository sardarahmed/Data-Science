Q:

Modifying Ros Driver Before Installing

Hi all,
I need to make some rather specific changes to a ros driver specifically to the ros-indigo-pointgrey-camera-driver, before installing it.  Does anyone know how I can do this?
thanks,
David

A:

You should install from source, not using debian package.
You should download source to your workspace from https://github.com/ros-drivers/pointgrey_camera_driver . After you can apply necessary changes and compile it with catkin_make.
