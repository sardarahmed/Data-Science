Q:

How to hide joint axis in Rviz

How do you hide the joint axis in Rviz, or at least make them translucent or smaller so they don't hide your model?
I have a model consisting of a box with a single thin "leg", but the joint axis indicators for the leg are so big, they're obscuring the leg.

The default leg position puts it right where the green cylinder is, which, as you can see, completely obscures it.

A:

The axes you're trying to hide are part of the TF display.
You can either disable the TF display completely, or expand the TF display properties and adjust the settings. It has a number of different options for changing the axes size, hiding and showing axes and the connecting arrows, adjusting the transparency, and and hiding and showing axes for individual frames.

Thanks. Digging into the urdf_tutorial's code, apparently that's all saved in a *.rviz file, so I can just copy that into my own package and customize the settings so I don't have to manually change them every time I load Rviz.

Hi,
I'm using RViz 1.11.10 from Jade and I'm editing the config file .rviz to hide some of the axes, however everytime I restart RViz all the axes are visible. All the other settings are maintained.
Any idea?
Francesco
