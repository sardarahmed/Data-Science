Q:

parse $(find ...) from python?

Hi everyone,
how can I make use of the ROS API to parse roslaunch macros like $(find <package>)?
Thanks

A:

It's not well documented as I believe it's not really intended to be reused outside of roslaunch, but you do this by essentially calling substitution_args.py::resolve_args(..) (here).
An example can be seen in xacro here.
