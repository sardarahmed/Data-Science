Q:

How to use opencv-contrib modules in ROS Indigo?

I am using ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04. I installed the OpenCV 3 for ROS with apt-get:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-opencv3

However, I would like to use modules from the opencv_contrib repository (https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib.git). Is there an easy way to install and use these within ROS?
Initially, I had a standalone OpenCV 3 installation with the contrib modules, but I had to uninstall it because of referencing issues when using ROS.
EDIT: I think the installation of OpenCV 3 is discussed in point 5 of http://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv, IÂ actually ran this script, but I'm not sure what to do after this.

A:

I can use some contrib modules in ROS indigo as dnn and rgbd, but on the other hand sfm is no available.
