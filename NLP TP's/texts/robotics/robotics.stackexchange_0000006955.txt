Q:

How to make a robot move using Arduino other than timing to predefined locations?

How to make a robot move using Arduino other than timing to predefined locations? and without the use of sensors?? I want to make my car move to different locations on a board..want to know the possible options without using sensors and encoders??
And how does cartesian robot work for predefined locations..does it require sensor too?

A:

Cartesians Robot use sensors. All robot need sensors. Sometime they are external (camera looking at the robot), sometime they are on the robot (IMU). 
Basically what you're asking is : 

How can an animal without any way to sense the world move from an exact point to another ?

Well, it can't.
Why do you wish not to use sensors ? There are very cheap ones out there that could help you with your project. You just need to define this project a little better so you can find the sensor that works for you.
Btw, going to predefined location without sensor like encoders, is not really feasible either. Or a pain. You'll need to calculate an approximate speed from the voltage (and, as someone pointed out, knowing the voltage would need a sensor) you input in the motor and, trust me, it's not going to be very accurate. The drift is going to kill you.
