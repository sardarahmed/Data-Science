Q:

How do i use moped on ROS

I downloaded ROS Grrovy prebuilt with ubuntu. I checked  the moped documentation.. it says that ROS already has moped installed on it.  I used the 'make' command in the src folder ,but still it said makefile not found.
If someone has run moped on ROS .. can you please guide me?

A:

Check the basic tutorials for ROS : the Makefile is not in the src directory but at the node root.
