Q:

velodyne_driver test for ROS hydro?

In ROS groovy the Velodyne packages are saved in /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/velodyne/ velodyne_Driver or velodyne_msgs or velodyne_pointcloud. Each velodyne directory has subdirectories bin, launch, src, lib, and test!
But in ROS hydro the velodyne files are divided in directory /opt/ros/hydro/  shared, or lib, or include. Without a commun directory of the velodyne stack. But, where are the velodyne test? Aren't there in hydro version?

A:

ROS Hydro requires released binaries to use the newer catkin build tools.
The different file layout is an effort to follow the Linux Filesysterm Hierarchy Standard. REP-0122 documents the layout, along with the motivation for making those changes.
Unfortunately, the current ROS packaging tools do not install unit tests. To build and run them, you must check out the package sources into a catkin workspace.
For the Velodyne driver, the source repository is here: https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne.git. The current Hydro release version has the velodyne-1.1.2 tag. The master branch may include unreleased updates. You are welcome to use that, but it is not as thoroughly tested as an official release.

I previously understood I could use catkin or rosbuild to build a package. In hydro, I can use just catkin right?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2014-03-20:
No, for packages you are not going to release using the ROS buildfarm you can use "catkin" or "rosbuild" - in Groovy, in Hydro, in Indigo and likely even in any upcoming distro afterwards. But if you want to release your package using the ROS farm to create Debian packages it must be a "catkin" package as of Hydro.
