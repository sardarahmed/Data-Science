A:

[rospack] couldn't find dependency [mapping_msgs] of [skeletal_tracker]
THE problem is it lacks mapping_msgs package !!
solution :
1.just download mapping_msgs(http://www.ros.org/wiki/mapping_msgs),via :
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/motion_planning_common/trunk/mapping_msgs

,and then :
rosmake mapping_msgs

when building mapping_msgs ,it throw problem that it lacks :
[rospack] couldn't find dependency [geometric_shapes_msgs] of [mapping_msg

download geometric_shapes_msgs,and then rosmake it.all will be ok !!
enjoy it !!
