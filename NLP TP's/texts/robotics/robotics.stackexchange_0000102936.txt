Q:

Turtlebot3 package - ROS2

I want to enlarge my wheel using the physical turtlebot3. I'm learning how robotis made the package by looking at the code, anyone know where is the value 0.087890625[deg] derived or get from? is it the Goal Position?
// 0.087890625[deg] * 3.14159265359 / 180 = 0.001533981f
you can see this in the joint state or odometry.cpp file in opencr code
Thanks ROScommunity in advance.

A:

Googling this specific value 0.087890625 I got this Arduino forum post - it looks like it is connected to the step motor and its number of steps per revolution.
One of the answers from the link:

64 steps per revolution (5.625° steps) and 1:64 gearing gives 4096 steps per output shaft revolution (0.087890625° steps).

P.S.
Be a bit careful with enlarging the wheel radius - calculate how much you can enlarge it before the motor gives up.
