Q:

RViz is not working properly and showing extra joint

this is the urdf file that i am using in RViz
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<material name="blue">
    <color rgba="0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0"/>
</material>

<material name="grey">
    <color rgba="0.0 0.5 0.5 1.0"/>
</material>

<link name="B">
    <visual>
        <geometry>
            <box size="0.6 0.4 0.2"/>
        </geometry>
        <origin xyz="0 0 0.1" rpy="0 0 0"/>
        <material name="blue"/>
    </visual>
</link>

I don't know why is "" and "" is not showing in the file but I am getting this output

using this command
ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=shitbot.urdf

A:

Can you give more details, if you are making your own package. If yes, then you need to write your own launch file accordingly so that all the parameters/files parses correctly.
Please also refer to the launch file for the urdf_tutorials at:
