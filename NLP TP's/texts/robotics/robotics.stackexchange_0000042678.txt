Q:

openni_launch problem

I tried to use the openni_kinect. There is no errors or warnings when I installed openni_kinect as the instructions in http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect, but when I tried to use openni_launch by typing
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
in the terminal,
It has many errors as follows:
Found 23 error(s).

I highly appreciate your time and great help!

A:

I need some more info from you... Are you on a turtlebot? Are you using a kinect camera? Is it powered from the turtlebot?
Assuming you have the turtlebot with a kinect: I had some trouble when I plugged the kinect into the USB 2.0 ports. Try it int he USB 3.0. If that doesn't fix it, run this and post the output:

I was under the impression that the Kinect did not work with USB 3.0 at all... Did you possibly mean it the other way around?
Comment by allenh1 on 2012-07-27:
Nope. I've always used it through USB 3.0
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2012-07-27:
Interesting, I don't have USB 3.0 to test it on, but I have seen quite a few posts such as this and this that say otherwise.
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2012-07-27:
Although this post has a comment that says with newer kernels it might be possible.  Regardless, I suppose it is a moot point until the @LiliMeng responds.
