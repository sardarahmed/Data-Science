Q:

Libfreenect won't install properly on 12.04 Hydro

I am trying to use libfreenect with a kinect. The output when I run
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect-xyz.launch
is
[ INFO] [1413756004.829132537]: Number devices connected: 1
[ INFO] [1413756004.829250239]: 1. device on bus 000:00 is a Xbox NUI Camera (2ae) from Microsoft (45e) with serial id '0000000000000000'
[ INFO] [1413756004.831311636]: Searching for device with index = 1
[ INFO] [1413756004.843299915]: No matching device found.... waiting for devices. Reason: [ERROR] Unable to open specified kinect

The next command I ran was
rosrun libfreenect glview.
This returned
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named glview below /opt/ros/hydro/share/libfreenect
So I tried
alex@alex-OptiPlex-GX620:~$ rospack find libfreenect
/opt/ros/hydro/share/libfreenect
alex@alex-OptiPlex-GX620:~$ cd /
alex@alex-OptiPlex-GX620:/$ cd /opt/ros/hydro/share/libfreenect
alex@alex-OptiPlex-GX620:/opt/ros/hydro/share/libfreenect$ ls
package.xml

From my understanding this means the proper packages that should come with libfreenect have not been installed. I have tried re-installing with no success. I have run
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

I have made sure to run
sudo modprobe -r gspca_kinect
echo 'blacklist gspca_kinect' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

The kinect is being connected by USB 2.0. The result of lsusb is

A:

The issue is the model of the Kinect itself. Version 1473 is currently experiencing issues with the freenect library. Furthur discussion here: https://github.com/ros-drivers/freenect_stack/issues/12
