Q:

CMake Error at vision_visp/visp_bridge/CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):

Hello, I tried the following command to install vision_visp
git clone -b kinetic-devel  https://github.com/lagadic/vision_visp.git

However, I am not sure that why I am getting the following error:
CMake Error at vision_visp/visp_bridge/CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindVISP.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "VISP", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "VISP" with any of
  the following names:

        VISPConfig.cmake
    visp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "VISP" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "VISP_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "VISP"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

Invoking "cmake" failed

Can anyone help me please to solve this error? I am using ROS Noetic in Ubuntu 20.04.

A:

There are following two ways to install vision_visp:

Install using apt: I prefer this option as it takes care of installing dependencies and takes less time. Please use the following command:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-vision-visp

Install from source: This definitely takes a considerable amount of time to compile. Furthermore, all the dependencies must be installed before compilation. Please see below for more details:
ravi@dell:~/ros_ws$ source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

ravi@dell:~/ros_ws$ git clone --branch noetic git@github.com:lagadic/vision_visp.git

ravi@dell:~/ros_ws$ sudo rosdep init

ravi@dell:~/ros_ws$ rosdep update

ravi@dell:~/ros_ws$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro noetic
executing command [sudo -H apt-get install libdmtx-dev]
executing command [sudo -H apt-get install ros-noetic-visp]
executing command [sudo -H apt-get install libzbar-dev]

ravi@dell:~/ros_ws$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 

You can notice that we have quite a few dependencies to build this package!

Finally, the above steps are taken from the wiki page and confirmed on my machine (ROS Noetic in Ubuntu 20.04)
