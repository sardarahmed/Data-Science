A:

To run a rosjava node do:
# rosrun rosjava_bootstrap run.py <PACKAGE> <Node>

for example for the tutorial:
# rosrun rosjava_bootstrap run.py rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.tutorials.pubsub.Talker

to run the talker,
and in another terminal:
# rosrun rosjava_bootstrap run.py rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.tutorials.pubsub.Listener

For me it only works once I've previously launched the ros Master, seems that it fails when launching it from the java Classes of the nodes
