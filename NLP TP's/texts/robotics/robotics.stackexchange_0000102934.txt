Q:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'launch'

Running python3 rrbot_system_position_only.launch.py from here https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos/blob/master/ros2_control_demo_bringup/launch/rrbot_system_position_only.launch.py. But following the error message appears
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ros2_control_demos/ros2_control_demo_bringup/launch/rrbot_system_position_only.launch.py", line 15, in <module>
    from launch import LaunchDescription
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'launch'

I already tried the solution suggested in https://answers.ros.org/question/389046/importerror-no-module-named-launch/ but that did not work. Can you guys please help me solve this error? Thank you.
