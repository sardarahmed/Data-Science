Q:

generate cmake debug files for isolated catkin workspace

Hi everyone,
I have a problem while trying to use eclipse to debug ros c++ projects in an isolated catkin workspace.
In this workspace I have several packages, that I build with:
catkin_make_isolated --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"

However, in order to debug, I have to create the corresponding tracing files that typically would have to be created by going to the "catkin_ws/build" directoy and using
cmake ../src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Unfortunately, if I try to use this in the build folder for the isolated catkin workspace  "catkin_ws/build_isolated/", I get the error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_workspace.cmake:95 (message):
  This workspace contains non-catkin packages in it, and catkin cannot build
  a non-homogeneous workspace without isolation.  Try the
  'catkin_make_isolated' command instead.

Without building these debug files, I get  the following eclipse error while debugging:
No source available for main

Do you have any idea where and how to get these cmake debug files?
Thanks a lot!

A:

You can pass the build type directly by calling
catkin_make_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
