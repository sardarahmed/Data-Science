Q:

Can we install ROS 1 and ROS 2 in the same system running on Ubuntu 20.04?

I am using ROS Noetic on my machine running on Ubuntu 20.04. But I want to migrate to ROS 2. Can I install ROS 2 along with ROS 1 on the same machine? If I did, what and how will be the causes?

A:

Yes, we can install ROS and ROS 2 in the same system. Just make sure you source the right version of setup.bash:
source /opt/ros/<ros_distro>/setup.bash

Also, make sure to install the correct ROS 2 distro for your ubuntu platform. In your case, that's Foxy Fitzroy (for Ubuntu 20.04).
If you install correctly, everything will be fine since all the relevant packages are installed at different locations.
ROS 1   /opt/ros/noetic/
ROS 2  /opt/ros/foxy/ (EOL May 2023)
