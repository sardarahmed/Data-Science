Q:

Problem of using package "gmapping" in groovy

I created a new pkg and need a dependency on gmapping pkg
After the new pkg created with catkin_create_pkg uu roscpp gmapping
when I do catkin-make,errors occured like following:
"
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gmapping" with any
of the following names:
gmappingConfig.cmake
gmapping-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "gmapping" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"gmapping_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"gmapping" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
been installed.
......
"

Any help??

A:

gmapping is not catkinized yet. You can only depend on catkin packages from catkin, so this won't work.
You can switch to rosbuild if you really need gmapping as a dependency.
