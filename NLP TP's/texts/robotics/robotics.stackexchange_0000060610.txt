Q:

CodeRef macro not working in wiki

http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20%28C%2B%2B%29#preview
So on this page, the CodeRef macro didn't work, and I've even tried to copy-paste the corresponding section in
http://wiki.ros.org/WritingTutorials#preview
==== CodeRef ====
In a tutorial, you want to reference a code block that you have created earlier in the tutorial you can use `CodeRef`. 
{{{start
{{{
#!cplusplus block=blockname
code....
is super 
and awesome
}}}
start}}}

You can then use the `CodeRef` macro to refer to it
{{{
<<CodeRef(blockname,1,2)>>
}}}

This then looks like:

<<CodeRef(blockname,1,2)>>

the exact same section which works on the "writing tutorials" page didn't work on "writing a tf listener" page.

A:

Looking at the change you (assumed by the user name) made, I guess you've figured it out somehow by yourself; As the tutorial you referred to points out:
Note that #!cplusplus or #!python line needs to be in a new line (ie. new line after three beginning parenthesises). 

it seems that a new line is required with CodeRef, which you did in your commit.

Update 7/14/2014) Anyways, for referring to codes on github, it looks like GetCode replaces CodeRef macro.

I did make a new line for that code, but it seems that might not be the case (or just the website take effect with a delay, not in real time) as the page remains the same after I did the change. and when I come back a day later, everything is fine.
