A:

This is probably a transient error. Please try again after some time.
Also, see ROS indigo key server down for an alternative in case you don't want to wait for it to come back up.

Up to you. ROS installation is really only a few lines anyway. Just make sure the file does what you expect it to.

I cannot find that in the script you linked, so it's probably something that you did. Please open a new question for this unrelated issue.
