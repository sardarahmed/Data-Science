Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ps3joy on OSX

I see the package for Linux to use a PS3 Dual Shock joystick, but is there a similar package for OSX? Thanks.

A:

I have finally found a way to use my PS3 controller with ROS that doesn't involve my having to learn Python. I wrote a simple package call osx_joystick that will publish either sensor_msgs::Joy or geometry_msgs::Twist based on the analog sticks or button values.
