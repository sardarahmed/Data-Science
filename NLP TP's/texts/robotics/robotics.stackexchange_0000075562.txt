Q:

How can I spawn multiple of the same robot, and control them individually?

Hey, I'm using Indigo for a project involving swarms of robots.
I want to be able to spawn and control multiple of the same URDF into Gazebo. I've been attempting to use the RRBot (from this tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control) for this purpose.
I open Gazebo with one RRBot as such:
roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch
And then are able to control it with the topics that this line loads in:
roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch
However, if I load more RRBots into the simulation with different model names and namespaces as with:
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file `rospack find rrbot_description`/urdf/rrbot.xml -urdf -y 1 -model rrbot2 -robot_namespace rrbot2
There are: a) No topics displayed with which to control the newly spawned rrbot2, b) Naming conflicts such as the one below:
[ERROR] [1469970215.112663786,
27.972000000]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/rrbot/controller_manager/list_controllers]
Is there a way to spawn multiple of the same URDF that can be independently controlled and not cause conflicts?
Any feedback would be much appreciated.

A:

This repository has an excellent demo of a robot swarm:
https://github.com/nevinvalsaraj/swarm-gazebo-simulator
It uses an SDF so works well with Gazebo.
