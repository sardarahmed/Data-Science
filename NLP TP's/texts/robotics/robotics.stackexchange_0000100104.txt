Q:

RoboStack Turtlebot3 teleop

I started to play around with RoboStack https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-noetic. I think is promising but still there is work to do. The installation was not very straight forward in Windows but with some work I was able to figure it out. I was also able to run turtlesim without much problems, however turtlebot3, I am able to launch gazebo, start the teleop node, check that is publishing correctly, but turtebot3 doesn't move in Gazebo. Unfortunately there is no error I can share, it just doesn't work. If anyone has come across this problem, open to suggestions. Thank you.

I tried those things. RoboStack is new way to run ROS under Anaconda and is experimental. Thank you for the suggestion.

I think you should go with ubuntu then.

I am experimenting with RoboStack to see if itâ€™s stable to use for education. But yes no issues using turtlebot3 with WSL or Ubuntu :)

A:

Got it to work, had to start from scratch again:
RoboStack (for ROS Noetic)
$ conda create -n robostackenv python=3.8
$ conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
$ conda config --env --add channels robostack
$ conda config --env --set channel_priority strict

$ conda install -c robostack ros-noetic-desktop-full
on Windows, install Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 with C++ support
see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160
$ conda install vs2019_win-64

$ conda deactivate robostackenv
$ conda activate robostackenv

Turtlebot3 installation:
$ conda install -c robostack ros-noetic-turtlebot3
$ conda install -c robostack ros-noetic-turtlebot3-gazebo
$ conda install -c robostack ros-noetic-turtlebot3-fake

Notice that the installation to work:
$ conda install -c robostack ros-noetic-desktop-full

For some reason yesterday it was working conda install ros-noetic-desktop-full but not anymore.
