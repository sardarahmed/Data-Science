Q:

When planning a trajectory, why is there never an initial in-place rotation?

Maybe this is a result of my configuration choices, but why does the planner never do an initial in-place rotation?  It is happy to do an in-place rotation at the end of a move.

A:

Hello. I discovered that it will do an initial in-place rotation toward the planned path if you set this base_local_planner parameter:
heading_scoring: true
You may also want to set heading_scoring_timestep, perhaps to match the value that you set sim_time to. Its default of 0.1 seconds did not work well for us.
Before discovering this parameter, we had implemented a custom node to sit between the output of the nav stack and /cmd_vel which would force an initial in-place rotation, but now we no longer need that.
