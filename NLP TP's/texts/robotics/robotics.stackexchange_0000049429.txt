Q:

how can I run pick_an_place on non-pr2 robot?

I have created a robot which has two dynamixel based arm. I am using a kinect in the head for sensor perception. I can manipulate my arms by /follow_joint_trajectory and also from arm_navigation.launch file which has been created by planning_description_configuration wizard. I can also manipulate the arm using warehouse_viewer. I have checked the pick_and_place_demos by PR2 in gazebo. But I find this really complex. Can anybody guide me step-by-step that how can I do same type of work on my non-PR2 robot???

Hi,
Indeed pick & place (object_manipulation stack) is complex.
You already managed to get your arm working in the warehouse_viewer which means you have kinematics and robot_description running.
What is complex is the whole setup (everything must be connected together). You may want to have a look at a diagram we created to understand the different parts of object_manipulation_stack Page 6 of this tutorial :
We also went for a rewrite of the wrapper (the thing commanding sub-functions to do pick and place) in our project. You can find an early version of our wrapper in the shadow sr-manipulation stack here as well as launch files that startup a lot of things.
It is not in a release state but you may find some ideas on how to proceed.
Hope this helped.
