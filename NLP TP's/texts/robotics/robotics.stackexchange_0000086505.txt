Q:

Problem with Logitech C270 webcam and Usb_cam

Hi everyone, I'm new in ROS and I'm triying to use "usb_cam" for recieve images from a Logitech C270 webcam, but I have a problem with the visualizer "image_view".
I can connect with the webcam using "rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node" but when I want to see the visualizer using "rosrun image_view image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw", I only see a green image from the webcam. Also, I tried to visualizing the webcam images with rqt_image_view and I can see the same.
With others programs or apps in Ubuntu the image webcam it's succesfully, but in ROS I can't use the webcam without see a green image.
I've read in this forum and I've tried a lot of options for resolve my problem and I couldn't do it. For this motive, I write this post and I wonder... What's my problem?

A:

The default parameters for usb_cam are unlikely to work, you'll need to discover them and then have a rosrun like:
rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node _image_width:=1280 _image_height:=720 _framerate:=15 _video_device:=/dev/video0 _pixel_format:=mjpeg

You can use guvcview to determine working resolutions and formats, or a command line like
v4l2-ctl --device=0 --list-formats-ext

Hi Lucasw, thanks for your response. I'm going to try this and find the parameters of my webcam to repeat the whole process.

I couldn't solve the problem and I used another camera, but it's possible my camera didn't work correctly. You can try it with your new logitech.
