Q:

how to pass data to two different nodes exact same

Hi,
I  am working on a project to command six motors around same time. Due to my project requirement, I have created two different nodes to command 3 motors on each node. But, I am wondering how can I pass command information to these nodes at exact same time. So that, two nodes will start executing the commands at same time. I really appreciate it if anyone can help me with this issue. Thanking and have a nice day.

A:

Maybe you could use message_filters package?
http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters

###Overview
message_filters is a utility library
for use with roscpp and rospy. It
collects commonly used message
"filtering" algorithms into a common
space. A message filter is defined as
something which a message arrives into
and may or may not be spit back out of
at a later point in time.
An example is the time synchronizer,
which takes in messages of different
types from multiple sources, and
outputs them only if it has received a
message on each of those sources with
the same timestamp.

This will allow you to get the output at the same time, but I'm not sure about the execution start time in these nodes...

Thank you ljaniec for the answer. I had a look in to this message_filters before.But, whatever I understand it wont serve my purpose. May be I am wrong and will double check again.Once again thank you so much :)
