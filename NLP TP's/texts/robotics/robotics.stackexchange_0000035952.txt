Q:

starmac-ros-pkg and simulated_quadrotor

hi all,
I want to work with tha package simulated_quadrotor from the starmac_robots stack. So, i installed starmac-ros-package following the tutorial.
The problem is that there isn't the simulated_quadrotor stack in my folder, i missed this package.
Why there is the documentation about it, but there isn't it?
