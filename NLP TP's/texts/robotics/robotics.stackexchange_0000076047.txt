Q:

Asus laptop not connecting to Kobuki base?

My Asus Laptop doesn't seem to see the Kobuki base.  When I use the command
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
I get a Device does not (yet) available on this port, waiting....
The laptop is connected via the USP printer port on the kobuki.  Does anyone have an idea what might be at issue?
I've run out of ideas Thanks,
