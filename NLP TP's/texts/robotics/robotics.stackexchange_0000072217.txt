Q:

Can't set up keys - server times out

I'm installing ROS Indigo on a fairly fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04. I try to do step 1.3 and:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116

Executing: gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --homedir /tmp/tmp.iYA2SKI7oY --no-auto-check-trustdb --trust-model always --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/webupd8team-y-ppa-manager.gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116

gpg: requesting key B01FA116 from hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net

gpg: keyserver timed out

gpg: keyserver receive failed: keyserver error
Googling hasn't helped and previous answers on this forum are outdated. I tried to install it a week ago and I got the same error. Any ideas?

A:

Despite the fact that this issue persisted for a week, I tried again today and I did not receive this error. I assume it's the server's fault and there are just days at a time where you can't install ROS.

Unfortunately ROS does not maintain the key servers, and this has been a know issue in the past: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/roswiki/issues/140 . I've updated the tutorials to use the high-availability keyserver pool, which should help.
