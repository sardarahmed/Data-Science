Q:

map for footstep_planner

Hi all!
I use the ar_kinect package and ar_markers to recognize objects and calculate their position.
Now I like to create a map for the footstep_planner.
How can I create such a map with ROS? With packages can I use for this?
Thanks for help!

A:

The map for footstep_planner needs to be a regular obstacle map, as it is defined in nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid. For static maps, that can be a simple black & white bitmap that you send out with map_server.
If you get obstacle positions from artificial markers, you will have to create this obstacle map yourself.
