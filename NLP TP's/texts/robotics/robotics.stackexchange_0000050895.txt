Q:

footstep planner

Hi!
I use the footstep_planner and I have a question, respectively I am searching for a parameter, which I does not found.
Where can I specify the position of the foots from the robot. (I gave the planner a start position, but from where he get exactly the information about the position of left and right foot from the robot.)
Thanks for help!

A:

Starting feet can be set in the API with the function "setStart". There is no callback for that exposed, instead the callback uses the starting pose (x,y,theta) to place the feet around it (left and right).
In the footstep_navigation node, the robot's current foot locations from TF are used.
