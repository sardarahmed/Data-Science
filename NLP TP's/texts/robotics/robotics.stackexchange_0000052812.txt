Q:

What is the benefit & target of using ROS?

Can I control and access to my robot using ROS, or ROS is a simulating program only.

A:

Yes, ROS can be used to control robots.
ROS also includes packages for simulation.

See http://answers.ros.org/question/61939/why-use-ros/ and http://answers.ros.org/question/33811/why-choose-ros/ for some more information about what ROS can do / can be used for.
As first steps, I'd suggest to head over to ros.org and have a look at the tutorials and projects.
