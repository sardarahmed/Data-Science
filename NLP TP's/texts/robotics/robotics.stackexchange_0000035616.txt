Q:

performance comparison of math libraries

I was wondering if anyone has benchmarked the performance of the commonly used math libraries in the ROS community such as the KDL, Bullet & Eigen. In my work, I have to do hundreds of thousands of rotations & transformations at run time and right now I'm primarily using the KDL but I never looked into the performance of the individual libraries to determine if one is much faster or much slower than the others.
In a quick search on ros.org, I found a couple of pages, MathLibraries & RotationMethods, that discuss the libraries but don't offer a performance comparison. If someone has any insight into this topic, I'll post it on the MathLibraries page.
Should I assume that all of these libraries have comparable performance? If no one responds, then I'll just do some simple benchmarking of my own and post the results.

Thanks Armin. Yea, those stats are interesting but are hard for me to apply to work like we do - mainly 3D transforms.

The Eigen benchmarks are also interesting: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Benchmark but only cover large matrix and vector operations, and not the traditional 3D coordinate transforms. Bullet at least looks highly optimized for that task.

I would be interested in seeing this comparison as well!

A:

Coming up with a good, representative benchmark for comparing math libraries is quite a lot of work. The results would be interesting, but maybe no one has done it yet for those libraries.
If you come up with comparisons of your own, please post a link on ros-users. I am sure many people will be interested in your results.
