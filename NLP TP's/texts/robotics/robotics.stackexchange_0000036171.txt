Q:

diagnostics during hardware failure

I am trying to find out best practice for using ROS diagnostics in hardware drivers. For example, say I am writing a driver to communicate with a device over serial port. When device node is launched, assume that the serial port could not be opened. In such a case, should the device node keep running with diagnostics updates or should it end the process? I would choose diagnostics updates over abort. Any comments are appreciated!

A:

I'd assume that it's really different for every system. It will come down to how you want to handle it. I know that on our project, when a hardware device cannot be connected, we have set up a "watchdog" process that monitors the status of the hardware devices and restarts any device that's malfunctioning.
