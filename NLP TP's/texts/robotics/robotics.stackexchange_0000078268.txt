Q:

Been assigned to make a custom robot able to navigate and on it's own

As my final year project, I've been assigned to make an NUC robot based ROS robot to self navigate. My previous seniors manage to get the movement and camera nodes to work. Using teleop and rviz. Honestly I don't know where to start in terms of self navigation and mapping. Any help would be amazing thanks.

Hi there,
A good starting point is the documentation of the navigation stack: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation
Check section 3 for how to setup the navigation stack and how to build a map
Good luck!
