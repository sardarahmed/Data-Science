Q:

Start Python with Optimizer Flag

Hi together,
is there a possibility to start the nodes that are written in Python with the optimization flag -O?
I want to provide two different builds: debug and release. The optimizer flag should only be set in the release build mode.
Thank you,
Best Regards
Markus

A:

I've found one solution:
Adding the following attribute to the node in the launch file:
launch-prefix="python $(arg optimization_flags)"

with
<arg name="optimization_flags" value="-OO" />
