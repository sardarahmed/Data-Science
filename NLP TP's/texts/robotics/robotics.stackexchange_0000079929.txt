Q:

Held broken packages ROS-Indigo install on Ubuntu 14.04.5

Hi,
After following the instructions on ROS Wiki,
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

Gives error
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-indigo-desktop-full : Depends: ros-indigo-desktop but it is not going to be installed
                           Depends: ros-indigo-perception but it is not going to be installed
                           Depends: ros-indigo-simulators but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

I also tried
sudo apt-get install libsdformat1

And
sudo apt-get install -f

Nothing worked.
What to do?
