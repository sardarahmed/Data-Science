Q:

Visualizing Turtlebot Kinect Data - Empty menu on New Display window

New turtlebot user. I was able to teleoperate turtlebot.
Now I am following "Visualizing Turtlebot Kinect Data" tutorial.
When I click the Add button on RViz window, New Display window opens, but there is nothing listed to add.
Do I need to install anything special before running RViz?

Can you post the output of running "rostopic list" on the computer you're using rviz on? Also, when you have new information about your problem, please edit your question rather than posting an answer.

A:

If your rviz config was cleared you may not be loading the default plugins.  See the rviz User Manual for instructions.
You need to make sure the "Builtin" plugins are checked off as "Loaded".

Plugins were not checked. Now that I checked it, the list is visible now.
