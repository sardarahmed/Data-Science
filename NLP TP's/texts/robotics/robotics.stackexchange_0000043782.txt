Q:

installing fuerte on arch linux

I'm getting the error
[ 98%] Generating rosout_panel_swig_generated.cpp, rxtoolscpp.py 
:1: Error: Unable to find 'swig.swg'
:3: Error: Unable to find 'python.swg'
/tmp/yaourt-tmp-evan/aur-ros-core/src/ros-underlay/rx/rxtools/src/rxtools/rxtools.i:2: Error: Unable to find 'std_string.i'

/tmp/yaourt-tmp-evan/aur-ros-core/src/ros-underlay/rx/wxPython_swig_interface/src/wxPython_swig_interface/core.i:25: Error: Unable to find 'typemaps.i'

when attempting to install fuerte on 64 bit arch linux. I do have swig-wx installed, I'm guessing the ros installer expects swig-wx to be somewhere besides where it installed to.
Has anyone seen this issue before? What should I try to fix it?

A:

You're going to need to make sure that CMake can find swig-wx using find_package.  It probably needs a CMake module or config file on arch.
