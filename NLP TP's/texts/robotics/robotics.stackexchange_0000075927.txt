May I suggest a title change/edit? "error 81%" doesn't really describe your problem. Perhaps something like: "uwsim: uwsimbenchmarks/GTpublish.h: No such file or directory" (without the quotes)?

A:

When installing the catkin compiles, and the problem is the compilation, It those not found <uwsimbenchmarks/GTpublish.h>, check you dependencies, CMakefile.txt and the package.xml, the problem is there.
