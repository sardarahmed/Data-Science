There is a simulated quadrotor available in the hector_quadrotor stack.

A:

tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg is a svn-based repo. We currently haven't yet generated Debian packages for our stacks, so you'll have to manually do either
svn checkout http://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg-read-only

for checking out the electric version of the packages
or
svn checkout http://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/fuerte/ tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg-read-only

for the fuerte version of the packages.
