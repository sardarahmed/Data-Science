Q:

Compiling pcl_trunk/visualization

I just cloned pcl1.6(https://bitbucket.org/bhaskara/perception_pcl_fuerte_unstable) in my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
And I want to modify the visualization tool (visualization), which is located at /pcl16/pcl_trunk/.
I tried compiling it with rosmake but I wasn't successful.
Nothing happens when I compile it. What is the right way to compile it?
Do I need to modify any of the CMakeList.txt, manifest.xml files.
Confituration:
ROS fuerte
Ubuntu 11.10
Thank You

A:

PCL trunk builds the stand-alone version, not the one that works with ROS. The ROS sources (for PCL 1.5) are in https://github.com/wg-debs/pcl
This is a huge mess. I hope we can fix it in Groovy.
UPDATE: There is an interim PCL 1.7 solution in perception_pcl_fuerte_unstable. Follow the recently-updated "Integration with ROS" directions in the PCL Downloads page.
