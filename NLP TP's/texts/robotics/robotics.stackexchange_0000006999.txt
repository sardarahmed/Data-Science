Q:

Quadcopter frame design

Quadcopter frames seem to consistently follow the same X design. For example:

I'm curious to know why that is. It certainly seems like the most efficient way to use space but is it the only frame design that would work for quadcopters?
For instance, would a design like this work?

Why or why not?

A:

A frame in that configuration or any other witch holds the props in a square without being unbalanced would work, the reason that most people do it with cross bars is because the FC batteries and ESCs must go somewhere. For your proposed solution you would have to balance all of that equipment around the ring running power and control lines all around possible causing interference and inefficiencies. Not to say it doesn't or couldn't work, but it will not be ideal. 

A:

To answer your questions directly, the X-shape is not the only design that will work.  There are many variations of frame design around a number of rotors that can range from 3 to (in some cases) 8.  

Since it hasn't been mentioned in the other answers, I want to point out that perhaps the biggest reason for the X shape is to keep the weight in the center, which decreases the moment of inertia of the vehicle -- the vehicle will pitch and roll more easily in response to the thrust.
