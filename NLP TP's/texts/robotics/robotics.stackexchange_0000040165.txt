Q:

Can Gazebo use color/textures from collada files?

In Electric, Gazebo would color my simulated robot parts using the colors stored in the Collada .dae files.  In Fuerte, the robot seems to be just gray, with a material script used for color.  Is there any way to force Gazebo to use the colors stored in the Collada models?

Perhaps the textures need to be in a certain location?  I used to keep them in the same directory as the .dae files, but I've also tried the MEdia/materials/textures/ directory.

Hi, can you post your model for testing?  There's an outstanding ticket, possibly the same problem.
