Q:

What are the recommended interconnects for wiring a battery to a motor via its driver?

I am currently working with a combination of Tamiya and T-connectors. I have not previously had issues with either, but the T-connectors I'm using currently do not seem to be maintaining a connection. If I torque the T-connectors in a particular way they will start working, but if I leave them "floating" they disengage. My first thought was that the problem was I had 2 different brands of T connectors, but it turns out, after switching all to one brand, that some of them do not work properly.
My first question is if there are known problems with T connectors or if I probably just got a bad batch?
My second question is if there are better interconnects out there than either Tamiya or T? (specifically for wiring a motor to its driver and the battery to the driver)
Let me be clear, I am NOT looking for opinions. I obviously realize this could be based on personal preference, but I am specifically asking if there are engineering principles at play in the choice being made. If it really just comes down to preference, then I am only interested in the first question. I also realize the possibility of avoiding interconnects, but let's assume that's not an option.

A:

Anderson Power Poles (APP's) are your best source for a good connection. I have had MANY failures due to Tamiya, especially when with any kind of impact. I finally learned my lesson after being introduced to APP's. Never had any issues.
