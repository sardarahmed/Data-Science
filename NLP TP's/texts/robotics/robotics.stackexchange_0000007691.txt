Q:

Is anybody using robot simulators?

Do you use simulators for developing your robot algorithms or do you test directly in your robot?
I would like to get introduced into the simulators world, but don't know from where to start... can you recommend me one?
Regards

A:

I test everything in simulation I possibly can before I run on a real robot. I use V-REP extensively and have been extremely happy with it. The developers are extremely responsive and there is a free to use version for non-commercial purposes. They also have a great demo video outlining the features in V-REP.
I've also spent a couple of months using gazebo, which is completely open source and did work for many of the basics. I moved away from it at the time because they tend to like to take their own path with fun features like new communication protocols and from scratch API implementations that aren't necessarily critical to actually simulating robots, these libraries unnecessarily re-implement existing libraries that are well written and widely used like eigen. This is based on my interactions on the mailing list and bitbucket, in addition to the experiences of others I know.
