Q:

Binary data representation in messages

Is there a documentation on how the information transferred in ros messages is stored in the message's binary data (given that I have the describing msg file) ?
E. g. if I would want to create my own serializer and deserializer for an arbitrary programming language / system, where to find the information on how to do this?

There is some documentation. Those should get you started:
