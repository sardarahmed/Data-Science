Q:

Ubuntu Oneiric Install Fails

When I follow the directions for installing I am given this in response:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-electric-desktop-full : Depends: ros-electric-vision-opencv (= 1.6.7-s1320939105~oneiric) but it is not going to be installed
                             Depends: ros-electric-image-pipeline (= 1.6.3-s1320939324~oneiric) but it is not going to be installed
                             Depends: ros-electric-image-transport-plugins (= 1.4.2-s1320939218~oneiric) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Any ideas on what the problem is?
I'm on a fresh install of 11.10 i386 Ubuntu. I've tried with a different mirror with the same results

I got this error as well after recently reinstalling ubuntu, it was working just fine when I installed it about a month ago but I've removed ubuntu to try openSuse and fedora and when I reinstalled ubuntu again I got this error, have there been any updates in the ROS repositories or packages?

What is your system setup?  Distro arch etc.

A:

The Oneiric i386 was not updated until this afternoon for the new release of opencv.  It should be synced now.
