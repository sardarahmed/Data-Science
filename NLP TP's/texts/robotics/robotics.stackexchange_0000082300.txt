Q:

OMPL MoveIt! error in Kinetic

Ubuntu 16.04,
ROS Kinetic
Hey, I'm trying to use moveIt with ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. I'm just starting with MoveIt...
After configuring the robot with the moveit_setup_assistant, when I try to run the generated demo.launch I get
[ERROR] [1502554018.960375858]: Exception while loading planner 'ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner': Failed to load library /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/libmoveit_ompl_planner_plugin.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Could not load library (Poco exception = libompl.so.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory). 
Available plugins: ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner

And later
[ WARN] [1502554019.325665808]: MoveGroup running was unable to load ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner

I have installed moveIt, by installing the ros-kinetic-moveit package, it seems like the ros-kinetic-moveit-planners-ompl and ros-kinetic-moveit-planners are also installed.
libompl is also installed, but not version 12 as it appears to be required... when I try to install libompl12 I get an Unable to locate package error.
The rviz part seems to work, I can move the robot, etc. just the planning module is not working...
Any advices?

A:

The correct OMPL package for the binary builds distributed in ROS kinetic is ros-kinetic-ompl which installs the missing library as /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libompl.so.12
You probably decided to use a different one. In this case you will have to build your own MoveIt packages.

Thanks for the answer.
I've had ros-kinetic-ompl installed...
It's interesting - it didn't work at the beginning (even before I've tried to install libompl), but started now after I've purged libompl and ros-kinetic-ompl, and reinstalled ros-kinetic-moveit.

I followed @Matt_krainski 's suggestion but it did not work. However, it works after restarting the PC.
