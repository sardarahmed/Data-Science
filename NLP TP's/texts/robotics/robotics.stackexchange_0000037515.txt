Q:

rosinstall alternative

Hi,
Is there an alternative to rosinstall?
prince
Edit:
I am sitting behind a proxy in my office. Some of the packages like topological_navigation, deb is not available in diamondback. As per steps mentioned in wiki for this package, rosinstall is required. For installing rosinstall, easy-install look for some pkgs. which it is not able to fetch probably because of proxy. I am looking for wayaround of rosinstall. What all it download. If needed I can do manual fetch and compiles.

A:

rosinstall just goes out and does an svn, git, hg, or bzr checkout of a bunch of source files for you.  You can do it all manually if you want.
However as you clarified your issue is just traversing a proxy, I would simply recommend that you fetch the tarball and install it locally instead of using easy_install or pip.
You can get rosinstall from here and you'll also need vcstools available here
Note: you many have trouble with the checkouts too if you're having trouble getting easy_install to work.
