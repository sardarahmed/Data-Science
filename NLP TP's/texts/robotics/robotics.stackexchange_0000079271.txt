Q:

No completition of Cartesian Path using Moveit

Hello together,
I have a question regarding planning with a UR10 arm and Moveit. I try to compute a Cartesian Path around an object. And it frequently happens that the robot can not successfully follow the path until 100%. E.g. it stops after 59% etc. Looking on the control panel for the robot, I noticed that it could not execute the path completely because a joint limit is reached (-2 pi/2 pi). It is a little bit strange to me because normally Moveit should know that it will violate that limit and of course just setting the start state to something around 0 degree would do the job, but it starts for example sometimes with 250 degree for that special joint. Could you help me?
Thank you very much in advance!
Hannes

A:

The current cartesian path planning in MoveIt is quite limited.
Your specific example confuses me though. To use the GetCartesianPath ROS service, you have to provide the start state. If MoveIt were allowed to decide on a start-state, this would most likely end up in a non-cartesian trajectory to reach the start state first of all.
If you need further capabilities, have a look at the decartes project.
We are currently discussing to integrate this into standard MoveIt.

Sorry for my late response, wasn't able to get in.
The problem is that the robot can reach a state using different joint values. E.g. one joint value can be 20 deg or 200deg (+180deg). So my solution would be to tell the robot to use a value between [-180,180] for a pose. How can I do that?
