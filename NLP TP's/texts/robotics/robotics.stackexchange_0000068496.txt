Q:

Stereo camera calibration: system error

Hi all,
I'm trying to perform a calibration of a stereo usb camera using the usb_cam drivers. I am following the proper tutorial on the ROS wiki page (http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/StereoCalibration).
My stereo camera is publishing left and right images over ROS (/image_raw), I can run the calibration node and I'm able to perform the acquisitions of the samples. When I push the "Calibrate" botton, not so long after it appears this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/camera_calibration/cameracalibrator.py", line 244, in on_mouse self.c.do_calibration()
File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/camera_calibration/calibrator.py", line 1052, in do_calibration self.cal_fromcorners(self.good_corners)
File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/camera_calibration/calibrator.py", line 855, in cal_fromcorners flags = flags)
SystemError: new style getargs format but argument is not a tuple 

The roswtf command returns no errors or warnings.
I'm using ROS Indigo running on Ubuntu 14.04 and I just started using the ros framework so I'm not an expert at all.
The cameras I'm using are two ODROID USB-CAM 720P.
Can you please help me to figure out how to solve this isssue?
Greetings.

Hi! Make sure you are using the correct git branch, in case you compiled usb_cam repository from source.

Thanks for your answer.
The git branch I'm using is correct. For the installation of usb_cam I followed the steps described in http://answers.ros.org/question/197651/how-to-install-a-driver-like-usb_cam/.
By the way I can perform the (mono) camera calibration successfully. What's wrong?

It looks like your opencv version is expecting a different set of arguments. Which version of OpenCV are you using? 2.4.11 is working correctly in my system. Are you on a newer version?
Comment by I-man on 2015-07-13:
Yes. the command pkg-config --modversion opencv returns 3.0.0. Should I use a previous version of OpenCV?

A:

Hi!
You should install a compatible OpenCV version, such as 2.4.11. That error is telling you that the code is not compatible, as the API has changed.

Thank you so much. As you suggested, I installed OpenCV 2.4.11 and it works!

I updated my openCV to 2.4.11 but still getting the same error. Any idea why ?
