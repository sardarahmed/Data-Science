Q:

Reference paper for SDFormat (citation in bibliography)

Hi there, my question is not related to Gazebo itself, so I am not sure that this is the right place to ask my question: how should I cite the SDFormat in the bibliography of a scientific article?
Thank you in advance!

A:

Hi! That's great that you want to cite SDF in your work. Your best bet would probably be to cite the SDF website: http://sdformat.org/. You could also cite specific pages like a certain page from the documentation or specification tabs if you're referencing a specific function or feature. Other than that, we don't require any more specific citation than that. Let us know if you need more information than that!
