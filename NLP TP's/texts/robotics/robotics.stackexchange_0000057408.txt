Q:

How to call a service .srv from Terminal

A short question:
I have a service defined like this: (navigate.srv)

string[] path
---
bool command_processed

I would like to call it by a terminal with a command like:

rosservice call /navigate ...

I have tried with: 
... "path1, path2, path3" 
... 'path1, path2, path3' 
... "path1", "path2", "path3" 
... 'path1', 'path2', 'path3' 
... path1 path2 path3 
... path1, path2, path3 
... 
But i don't find the correct text chain(argument) to the service works.
Could someone help me?

It's a list, so something along '{path: []}. 'Can you try the "cheater" way and try tab completion?
