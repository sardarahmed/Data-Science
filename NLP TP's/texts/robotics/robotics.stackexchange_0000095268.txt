Q:

"c++: internal compiler error: Killed" while building Universal Robots ROS Driver

I am attempting to build the Universal Robots ROS Driver on ROS Melodic Ubutnu 18.04, but when I try to build the workspace with catkin_make I get the error below. What can I do to solve this? Thank you

A:

Are you building this in a VM? Because this error message:
c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)
Please submit a full bug report,

is typically printed when the compiler runs out of memory while trying to compile the code.
On VMs, this is rather common. Other platforms this happens often on are Raspberry PIs and similar SBCs (as they typically don't have swap and limited amounts of RAM).
It's likely this is not a problem with the code.

Thanks a lot for your help. You were right, it was an issue with memory. Increasing the memory of my VM meant that I could build this workspace without a problem. Thank you again

Please note that running ur_robot_driver in a VM is not recommended, due to the way a VM interferes with the determinism required for the driver to work correctly.
It's likely you will run into performance issues with the driver.

Ok, thank you, that's very good to know. What would be the best way to run it?
