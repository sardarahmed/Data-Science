Q:

tf2 - where's quaternion_from_euler gone?

Hi,
since I'm trying to migrate my workspace from Groovy to Hydro there are some questions arising. This is one of them. I'm going to post the others seperately.
In Python, how do I convert a vector of Euler angles into a quaternion using tf2? In tf there was something like
tf.transformations.quaternion_from_euler(...)

How's that done with tf2?
Thanks

A:

tf2 has been redesigned to provide only the functionality of tf and not bundle in external libraries for convenience.  transformations.py is an externally developed library which was included inside of tf for convenience.  For now you can continue to use it in that location. Down the road it would be cleaner to package transformations.py itself
More information on transformations.py can be found here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/
