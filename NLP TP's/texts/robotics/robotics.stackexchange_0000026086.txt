Q:

Where is /tf messages generated in DRCSIM?

When I do
roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch

and
rostopic list

I see /tf messages. Can someone point me to where in gazebo land (source code) is tf messages generated for atlas? Many thanks!

A:

tf is generated outside gazebo using the robot_state_publisher(s) (One for the robot, one for the multisense head). Gazebo publishes joint states of the robot. The robot_state_publisher nodes receive those, generate the tf transforms based on them and publish them to tf.
By running
rxgraph

You can look at the computation graph and see the topic connections between gazebo, robot_state_publisher and all other nodes.
See also the robot_state_publisher wiki page.
