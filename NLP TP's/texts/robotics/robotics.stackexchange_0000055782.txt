Q:

Why is my state_publisher build complaining about tf::TransformBroadcaster?

I am actually trying to put together enough to visualize my URDF model in RVIZ.
I currently have two files in my workspace:

…_ws/src/rbot_description/urdf/rbot.urdf
…_ws/src/rbot_description/src/state_publisher.cpp

When I call catkin_make the state_publisher fails to build.  The failure message reads:
"… undefined reference to 'tf::TransformBroadcaster::sendTransform(geometry_msgs::TransformStamped_std::allocator<void > const&)' "
What do I need to do to fix this error?

A:

"undefined reference to" error occurs when object file (.so file), corresponding to a particular included header has not been linked to your target (the executable to be built). In this case, tf/transform_broadcaster.h.
try adding this line in your CMakelists.txt:
target_link_libraries("name of executable"    "location of file"/_tf.so   "location of file"/_tf2.so )
put the location of the file _tf.so and _tf2.so in the respective "location of file"
eg.
target_link_libraries(state_publisher    opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tf/_tf.so  opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tf2/_tf2.so )
Also, if not added, add tf package dependency in manifest.xml.
