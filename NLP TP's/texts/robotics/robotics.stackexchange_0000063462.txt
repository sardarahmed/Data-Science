Q:

Problem package tutorial

Hi,
after the creation of my beginner_tutorials package:
catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
Created file beginner_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt
Created file beginner_tutorials/package.xml
Created folder beginner_tutorials/include/beginner_tutorials
Created folder beginner_tutorials/src
Successfully created files in /home/jacopo/catkin_ws/beginner_tutorials. Please adjust the values in package.xml.

if i use for example the rospack find, it say me this:
rospack find beginner_tutorials
[rospack] Error: stack/package beginner_tutorials not found

where is the problem??
Jacopo

Did you build your project with catkin_make?
If yes, have you sourced the workspace?
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

EDIT: fixed path

I believe Gary's command should actually have said source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash. Also, your beginner_tutorials package should be in ~/catkin_ws/src/. It looks like you put it in the root of your workspace ~/catkin_ws/.

If your package is in the right spot, your setup.bash is properly sourced, and catkin_make built the package with no errors, and you are still having the issue, then you could try running the command rospack profile. That forces rebuilding of the cache that tells the system where packages are.

A:

yes i made the catkin_make,
if i use:
source beginner_tutorials/devel/setup.bash

it give me this:
source beginner_tutorials/devel/setup.bash
bash: beginner_tutorials/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory

for create the package i've done exactly what the tutorial said, so:
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp

Please don't create answers to provide more information. In the future, add this extra information as an edit to your original question. Otherwise, people think your question is answered when it's really not.
