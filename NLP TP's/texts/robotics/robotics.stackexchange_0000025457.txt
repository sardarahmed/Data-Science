Q:

error spawning sdf models in gazebo under ROS groovy

Hi,
When trying to spawn a sdf model in Gazebo 1.2, I get the following errors:
Error [SystemPaths.cc:281] Unknown URI prefix[models/static_sphere.sdf]
Error [ModelDatabase.cc:219] Unable to download model[models/static_sphere.sdf]
Error [ModelDatabase.cc:391] Invalid model manifest file[/manifest.xml]
Error [World.cc:1201] Unable to read sdf file.
I am running Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS groovy, Gazebo 1.2.5.
I set up the variables with: source /path/gazebo-1.2/setup.sh
The paths in the manifest.xml file look like this:
gazebo gazebo_media_path="${prefix}"
gazebo plugin_path="${prefix}/lib"
Do I have to set up other path variables in the ROS package?
Thanks,
Andrei
UPDATE:
I have a ros package in ~/ros_package/ with the /models and /world folders in it.
There I use a world plugin to spawn models from my package (this used to work in Gazebo 1.0.2 with Fuerte, and it doesn't with 1.2.5 under Groovy). Here is my manifest.xml file from the package where the paths should be loaded.

As a workaround I copied all my models into ~/.gazebo/models and spawned them directly from the world file. But this is not very portable I would prefer setting up the paths in a way that I can use them from my package (I tried all the combination with the gazebo paths, and still had these errors).

This question is somehow related or may be duplicate of this one.
Cheers,
Andrei

I'm unclear on what you're trying to do, can you update your post with the command your running, the version of gazebo, the exact output of gazebo, and the directory structure of your model?

A:

Gazebo looks the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH to find models.
In your case:
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/ros_package/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
Gazebo looks in the GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH to find world files.
In your case:
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=~/ros_package/worlds:$GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH
