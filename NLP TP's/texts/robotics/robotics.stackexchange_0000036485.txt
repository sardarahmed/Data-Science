Q:

How to document actionlib interface / Best practice for messages from .action files

I want to document the action interface in nao_driver which uses custom actions defined in nao_msgs. However, the messages themselves are generated from the .action files and this does not seem to happen when the wiki documentation is built. As a result, the message links in the node documentation point to nonexistent pages and there are no actions visible at nao_msgs in the MsgSrvDoc macro block.  How should I document the interface? Is it considered "best practice" to check in the generated msgs from the .action files? I don't like the fact that this could cause a new checkin every time they are regenerated.

See http://ros.org/wiki/move_base for the current 'best practice'.  It's not great, but all that's possible now w/o  someone writing a plugin for rosdoc to handle actions the same way we do with msg/srvs.

You should never check in generated files.
If you wanted to get very clever, you could run rosdoc on your package against a built tree and save the msg docs and link to those, but that's still not an ideal solution to #1.

I meant to run rosdoc locally and uploading the html files to a server

Doesn't this mean that the msg files were checked in so rosdoc can generate the corresponding html?

Well I actually looked at move_base which caused my confusion ;) If you look at the action messages, all the links to message definitions (e.g. http://www.ros.org/doc/api/move_base_msgs/html/msg/MoveBaseActionGoal.html) are working.
