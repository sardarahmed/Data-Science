Q:

Using hector quadrotor with Gazebo 1.9 (or current bleeding edge version)

Dear all,
I am currently trying to get the hector-quadrotor uav to work with the new version of Gazebo (downloaded from source). I managed to install Gazebo and use it as described in the tutorials but when I try to run the hector quadrotor demo (described in the tutorial), Gazebo 1.5 runs instead the simulator-gazebo package is installed with the hector-quadrotor-demo package. Could someone kindly point out how to spawn the UAV in the new version of Gazebo (all i need to do is spawn the uav and control it I do not need to run the tutorials).
Thanks in advance,
JP

A:

Hi,
you might try to start gazebo and then just spawn hector directly:
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch 

and
roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo spawn_quadrotor.launch

The hector launch files that are starting gazebo are not updated to gazebo_ros yet...
