Q:

how can i use only costmap_2d map? (navigation stack without base_controller)

hi, currently i can create maps with gmapping + laser_scan_matcher and hector_slam.
i want to see obstacles in the map i create. so costmap is the answer i guess.
i just have lms100 laser scanner, not a robot system to control so in navigation stack, base_controler requirement is not met. so can i use a part of navigation stack which includes costmap_2d especially? if so, what is the proper way to do it?

A:

You can also run the costmap_2d_node (in the costmap_2d package)

for doing that properly, should i create and modify a launch file like example.launch (in the costmap_2d launch directory)??? is it enough for me to see obstacles in the map?
