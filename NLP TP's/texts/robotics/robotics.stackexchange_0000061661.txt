Q:

What does ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} represents?

In my CMakeList.txt, there is ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} but I don't know the exact values it represents. So I enter something like "echo ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}", but nothing comes out. My questions are:

how to find out what ${xxx} represents?  
2. are there differences between ${} and $()?

echo is not a CMake command, and ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} is not an environment variable (so you can't echo it). If you want to print it, use message("PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR: ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}") somewhere in your CMakeLists.txt.

@gvdhoom thank you for your answer, please once you use message("PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR: ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}") where would it be displayed/printed ?

On the console, during CMake configuration phase.
