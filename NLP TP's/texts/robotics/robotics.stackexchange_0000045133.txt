Q:

PCL Tutorial voxel_grid Permission Denied

Hello,
I am new to ROS, Ubuntu, and PCL.  I have Ubuntu 11.10.  I am attempting to complete the ROS PCL Tutorials at http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl/Tutorials.  I got stuck at step 4.1.
I was unable to get the ./voxel_grid command to work in the linked part of the tutorial at the PCL website at http://www.pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/voxel_grid.php.  I receive the following errors:
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~/my_pcl_tutorial$ ./voxel_grid
bash: ./voxel_grid: No such file or directory
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~/my_pcl_tutorial$ ./voxel_grid.cpp
bash: ./voxel_grid.cpp: Permission denied

I tried: albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~$ chmod 777 my_pcl_tutorial, but this did not change the output.
I moved on to the next step in the tutorial (the second part of step 4.1), and tried:
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~$ rosmake my_pcl_tutorial
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...                                                 
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['my_pcl_tutorial']                         
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory /home/albertchi/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20121022-112526
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['my_pcl_tutorial'] to:
[]                            
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['my_pcl_tutorial']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

Obviously, this was unsuccessful as well.  Suggestions would be appreciated.  I am hoping it is something simple because I am new.

What does executing ls -la ~/my_pcl_tutorial give?

Sorry this is so long and broken up.  Is there a better way for me to post a response in the future?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-22:
Instead of creating a lot of comments, it's better to edit the question.

A:

You need to set up a ROS workspace before you can compile your own packages. Have a look at this page and this tutorial.

Thank you for the guidance.  I attempted to do this using two methods:
I tried to add the my_pcl_tutorial file to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH using:
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~$ rosws set ~/my_pcl_tutorial
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~$ source /home/albertchi/setup.sh
but it returned the same error.
Comment by Amanda on 2012-10-22:
Second Method:
I copied the entire my_pcl_tutorial folder into the fuerte_workspace folder and did:
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~$ rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/my_pcl_tutorial
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~$ source /home/albertchi/setup.sh
but it returned the same error.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-22:
You must source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash, not /home/albertchi/setup.sh. The latter file should even not exist at all.
Comment by Amanda on 2012-10-22:
I originally ran source /home/albertchi/setup.sh because the output of rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/my_pcl_tutorial told me to run that command specifically. Idk why. I ran
albertchi@albertchi-e6510:~$ source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash
and I received the same error as before.
Comment by baogege on 2015-08-08:
