Q:

Medical robots models

Hi,
I am a lecturer in a university that just created a degree in "medical IT engineer".
The students have basic robotics courses, such as geometrical modeling and sensor-based control. I'd love to teach this topic using a medical robot simulator in Rviz, but the nearest I found is Care-O-Bot, which is not really a medical robot.
I already made the teaching code to play with any URDF, so I just need a medical related model.
Have you by chance heard of any existing ressources for this topic ?
Cheers.
