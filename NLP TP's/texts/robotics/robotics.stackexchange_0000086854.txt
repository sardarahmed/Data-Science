Q:

Heightmap from octomap_server?

Is there a package which can project a heightmap from registered pointclouds / an octree? Something like projected_map from octomap_server, but with height information instead of occupancy informations?
I would like to create difference images to determine if a floor has gaps or steep edges around the robot. Currently I am using a cut off pointcloud with an occupancy grid to determine if there is a hole in the floor, but I think a gradient image would work better.
If there is no one, could you just use the Z-Value of the leaf boxes of the octree to create one? Is there an easy way to iterrate over them?

A:

You can convert 3D point cloud data into a 2D elevation map using the elevation_mapping package. This will allow you calculate the traversability/safety of the map much more easily than the 3D map.
Hope this helps.
