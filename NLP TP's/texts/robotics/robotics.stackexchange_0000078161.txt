Q:

can't locate node [moveit_setup_assistant] in package [moveit_setup_assistant]

Because the moveit is updated recently.So I use "sudo apt-get remove ros-indigo-moveit" to remove moveit.And then I used "sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit" to reinstall moveit.It can be found in http://moveit.ros.org/install/ .
After that I open a new terminal. I can rospack find  moveit_setup_assistant in opt/ros/indigo/share.
But when I  run “roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch” It appeared error
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [moveit_setup_assistant/moveit_setup_assistant]: can't locate node [moveit_setup_assistant] in package [moveit_setup_assistant]

After I run "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" in the terminal.The moveit_setup_assistant works well.
I must source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash can I use moveit_setup_assistant.However, after source /opt/...,I can't rospack find the packages in catkin_ws.So after source /opt/...When I run move_group.launch, It appeared error.
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [moveit_ros_move_group/move_group]: can't locate node [move_group] in package [moveit_ros_move_group]

I must source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash can I use the packages in catkin_ws. However this way I can't use setup_assistant.launch
The bottom lines of my ~/.bashrc file is
source /home/robot508/catkin_ws/catkin_industrial/devel/setup.bash 
source /home/robot508/catkin_ws/le_myself/devel/setup.bash 
source /home/robot508/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

When I add the source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash to the last line,It also can't work. How can I  find the moveit_setup_assistant.launch and move_group.launch at the same time.

A:

source /home/robot508/catkin_ws/catkin_industrial/devel/setup.bash
source /home/robot508/catkin_ws/le_myself/devel/setup.bash
source /home/robot508/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

First, you're nesting catkin workspace (ie. placing workspaces into another workspace). While it's technically possible (I confirmed that catkin_make runs as intended for each workspace), I suggest not do that unless you really need to and you know what you're doing, because this may cause unexpected result (instead the normal way to use multiple catkin workspaces is to place each separately).
And your issue sounds like your catkin workspace might not be configured as it's supposed to. Remove build and devel folders in %YOUR_CATKIN_WS% and run catkin_make, source the setup again to see if it works. Your uncommon workspace setting might have done something funky so again I suggest you fix it.
If the issue persists you need to share more info esp. env|grep ROS.

Thank you very much. You are right. The nesting catkin workspace is uncommon. I rebuild my catkin workspace and now moveit works well. Thanks a lot
