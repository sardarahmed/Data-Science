Q:

MultiLibraryClassLoader Error

Hello everyone,
I'm writing a rviz panel.
When I change namespace (tiffer_panel -> Tiffer) in my code, and change the PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS.
#include <pluginlib/class_list_macros.h>
PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS(Tiffer::TifferPanel,rviz::Panel )

After Compiled, when I run rviz with this panel, got this
PluginlibFactory: The plugin for class 'Tiffer' failed to load.  Error: MultiLibraryClassLoader: Could not create class of type tiffer_panel::TifferPanel

It seems not change. But when I change the namespace back (Tiffer -> tiffer_panel), it works well again...
Can someone tell me what's wrong with this?

Did you also update your plugin.xml (or whatever you named that file)?

I did not find this file,can you plz tell me where it is?

It doesn't have to have exactly that name. But there should be a file that registers your plugin with the ROS plugin system. It's typically called plugin.xml and is referenced in your package's package.xml.

I had a similar error for a different problem, using the class_loader to make a MoveGroup capability. If anyone comes here searching: Make sure to modify not only the class files and the xml file, but also the CMakeLists.txt to generate the executable for the class you are trying to load.

A:

I solved this problem by modifving plugin_description.xml
<library path="libtiffer_panel">
  <class name="Tiffer"
         type="Tiffer::TifferPanel"
         base_class_type="rviz::Panel">
    <description>
      Tiffer's simple panel.
    </description>
  </class>
</library>

Just modify the type to what you change in your code.
