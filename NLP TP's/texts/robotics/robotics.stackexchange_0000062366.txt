Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: move_base_node

I was going through the code base of ROS navigation. I have some difficulty understanding the name field and type field for running a node in a launch file.
For example, I run the move_base node using the following line in my launch file.

node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen"

However, when I look at the source code for move_base, it has a file named move_base_node and during initialization as well is called "move_base_node"

ros::init(argc, argv, "move_base_node");

But the executable that is present in my devel folder is called "move_base". I wonder how the naming is supposed to work and how did it get changed.
The CMakelists file also contains "move_base_node" and not "move_base".
Thank you for your time.

A:

It's due to the set_target_properties(move_base_node PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME move_base) function in the CMakeLists.txt file.
