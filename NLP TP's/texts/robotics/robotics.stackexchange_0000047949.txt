Q:

Unable to load calibration file in uvc_camera over network

I tried to launch a node over the network with the following code:
<node machine="$(arg machine)" name="uvc_camera_bsl12" pkg="uvc_camera" type="stereo_node">
<param name="left/device" value="$(arg ldev)" />
<param name="right/device" value="$(arg rdev)" />
<param name="left/camera_info_url" value="file://$(find baseline12)/data/camera_yaml/bsl12_left_01.yaml" />
<param name="right/camera_info_url" value="file://$(find baseline12)/data/camera_yaml/bsl12_right_01.yaml" />
<param name="fps" value="15" />
<param name="skip_frames" value="3" />
<param name="width" value="640" />
<param name="height" value="480" />
<param name="frame_id" value="baseline12" />
<param name="left/rotate" value="false" />
<param name="right/rotate" value="false" />
</node>

but it says
rectified topic '/baseline12/left/image_rect_color' requested but camera publishing '/baseline12/left/camera_info' is uncalibrated

It seems that it doesn't load .yaml file because $(find) command load local path instead remote path.
Do you have any suggestion?
Thanks

A:

Check out a copy of the baseline12 package on the remote machine.
It would be possible, but tricky, for camera_info_manager to support http: URLs directly. If you feel you need it, please open an enhancement ticket.
