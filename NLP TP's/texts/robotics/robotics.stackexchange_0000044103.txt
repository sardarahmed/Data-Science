I'm not sure if Roboearth already has been ported to Fuerte. But please retag your question to help people who can help find your question.

A:

Write these commands in the terminal :
rosinstall ~/ros /opt/ros/fuerte 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=roboearth.rosinstall'
$ source ~/ros/setup.bash
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ias-common ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-addons ros-fuerte-simulator-gazebo ros-fuerte-vision-opencv ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping ros-fuerte-client-rosjava-jni.
rosmake roboearth

ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-addons does not exist in Ubuntu 12.04, should this be ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-fuerte-unstable? This doesn't work for me, unfortunately.
