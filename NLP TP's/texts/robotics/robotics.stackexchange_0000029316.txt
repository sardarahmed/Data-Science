Q:

[Ignition] PostRender event not called

Hi all,
I have a problem when integrating a camera plugin that I designed in ROS.
If I use the plugin in a world created with an SDF it correctly works, but if I attach it to a camera declared in a URDF to be used in ROS, the PostRender event (ignition::gazebo::events::PostRender) is never called and I cannot understand why.
The plugin is correctly loaded, the Configure and PostUpdate callbacks are correctly called.
Any idea?
Thank you
Walter

A:

The problem was the missing MinimalScene plugin.
When I added it and correctly set all the environment paths everything started to work as expected.
