Q:

navigation with kinect question

I`m a newer to the ROS,and now I want to do the simulation on my computer with the kinect first,and the final purpose is to do navigation with kinect.So I hope anyone can share your precious experiences about how to do navigation with kinect by steps.
The more detailed, the better!

I trully want to know the steps of using ros to accompish the vision navigation with kinect.By the way,now I have a robot but not the one showed on the ros.org.

Thanks very much!!!

You can see this: http://answers.ros.org/question/9087/vslam-based-navigation-with-kinect-where-do-i

A:

Using the kinect and doing a simulation are two different things. Do you have a kinect and do you wish to program it? Or do you wish to simulate kinnect data?
There is no way you can achieve navigation with just kinect. You will need a complete mobile robot to do that. Do you have a TurtleBot?
Please describe what you wish to do in detail.

Is it possible to use slam_gmapping with Kinect? I ask this because gmapping seems to use Laser scans where as Kinect publishes point clouds. Thanks.

The gmapping_demo.launch file uses the kinect to do the mapping. The kinect data are presented to the algorithm as though it is coming from a laser. In reality, it is only the point cloud data that is converted to Laser-like data. The answer to your question is yes.
