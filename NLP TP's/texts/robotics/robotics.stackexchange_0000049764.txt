Q:

Plotting lag, jitter, bandwidth and frequency of topics, how to?

I would like to plot the mentioned data during an experiment for one or more topics and nodes.
Is there a way I can do that?
I tried rxplot but it wants a message's field.
I could go as far as writing a node to publish all this data as messages, but since this data is shown (not published) by a mixture of rostopic and tfmonitor how would I go at collecting the data itself?

A:

I started putting together some tools for measuring these types of statistics and then publishing them out over ros topics themselves. I also wrote an rviz modified camera plugin which performs the statistics without creating an additional camera socket connection.
I only implemented stats for latency and message loss, but it shouldn't be hard to add features to estimate jitter and bandwidth, too.

Thanks, I'll have a look.

Cloned your code but it refuses to build. What release did you base it on? rosbuild, catkin, rosmake?
I'm stuck on fuerte right now as groovy had all sorts of problems compiling on arm.
Comment by jbohren on 2013-03-26:
It builds for me on fuerte, where is the build failing?
Comment by jbohren on 2013-03-26:
If you're trying to compile this for ARM, you might want to remove the deps from the manifest related to the rviz plugin, and then remove the rviz plugin from the CMakeLists. Really this package should be split into two: https://github.com/jhu-lcsr/lcsr_nettools/issues/2

No no i'm trying it on x86. i get a cmake fail on "moc_camera_display.cxx assuming it will be generated later" and

roslib.msgs.MsgSpecException: Cannot load type 'lcsr_nettools/TopicMeasurements'.  Perhaps the package is missing a dependency.
i manually checked every dependency in the manifest and I'm not missing any.
Comment by jbohren on 2013-03-26:
If you're having trouble building the QT stuff (probably missing deps) and don't care about the rviz camera plugin, you can just remove the add_subdirectory(rviz_plugins from CmakeLists.txt
Comment by Claudio on 2013-03-26:
maybe you could join me on the ROS irc channel? I don't see us debugging this on answers :p
Comment by Claudio on 2013-03-26:
Anyway it's not rviz the problem, it's something in Generating ../msg_gen/cpp/include/net_tools/TopicStatistics.h
Comment by jbohren on 2013-03-26:
Ok, I'm on irc.oftc.net#ros
Comment by jbohren on 2013-03-26:
The issue was that the package was checked out under a different name.
Comment by jbohren on 2013-03-28:
@Claudio Any luck?
Comment by thinwybk on 2018-04-09:
@jbohren Is lcsr_nettools still maintained (last commit 2015)? Is it fuerte only or working with indigo as well? Otherwise: Are there alternative solutions?
