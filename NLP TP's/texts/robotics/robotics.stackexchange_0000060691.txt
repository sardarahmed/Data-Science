Q:

get old data of tf

Dear ros-users,
is there a way of access old data of tf? I mean, when I lookup for a transform, I need the latest data together with second to last, third to last..
I'm working with tf on ros fuerte
Thank you!

Do you need the last/second to last, etc. in an index or time basis? If index-based: Why?
Comment by Rahndall on 2014-07-08:\

in an index basis
because, if I understood correctly, on time based the given data is an interpolation of two values. Instead, I would like to know if there is access to the actual values

A:

You can get in and instrument or access the interior storage by index. However it's not well defined as soon as you have more than one link in your span. If you need that sort of specific data I'd suggest that you generate and store it yourself.
