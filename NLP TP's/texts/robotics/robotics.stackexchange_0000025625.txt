Q:

feedforward torque?

It would be very useful to be able to apply a feedforward torque in addition to PID control:
torque = kp x positionerror + kv x velocityerror + ki x integratederror + torqueff
torqueff could be a constant or have a trajectory, as does desired position and velocity.
I see in the list of robot_mechanism_controllers 
http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot\_mechanism\_controllers
JointEffortController mode, which supports torque control but does not include PID control, and
JointTrajectoryActionController and JointPostionController which support PID control but not feedforward torques.
Is there a controller that supports both?
I see there used to be an ArmDynamicsController that looks like it had the right properties.
Google arm_dynamics_controller.cpp
Thanks,
Chris
