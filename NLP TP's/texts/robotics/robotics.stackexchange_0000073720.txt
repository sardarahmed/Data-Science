Q:

Camera_info for a camera publishing already rectified images

I have a camera which gives me images which are already rectified. I'm writing the ROS driver  for it and I'm wondering what I should do with the camera_info message. Should I :

Calibrate the camera and publish the intrinsic parameters in the camera_info message
Calibrate the camera and publish the projection matrix but set the distortion parameters to 0
Not calibration and set all the camera_info parameters to 0

For the record, I do not have access to the prerectified image, only the final result.

A:

Setting the first element of the intrinsic matrix, K[0],  to 0.0 should be accepted by the various image pipeline components as a "raw" or uncalibrated image. That would probably work fine for your device.

Alternatively, you could run the ROS calibration tool and publish its calibration. I would expect that to work OK with your already-calibrated images, although you should experiment to confirm that guess. Edit: experiment revealed unsatisfactory results.

Thanks!
For the second part of your answer, I did try but after the second rectification everything looks a lot worse .

It's not customary to close a question just because it has an acceptable answer. I'll re-open it.
