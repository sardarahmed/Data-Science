Q:

navigate to a local target

Dear ros-users,
I'm searching something to navigate toward an ar_tag. In particular, I would like to take information only regarding to the tag, avoiding reference to a global frame.
I'm (still..) working on ros fuerte.
Thank you

A:

Hi, take a look at https://github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_ocs/tree/indigo. The three packages named yocs_ar_ .... could be what you are looking for. But that's indigo code, so you will need to adapt it.
