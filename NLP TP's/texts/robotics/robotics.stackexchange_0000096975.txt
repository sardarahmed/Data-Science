Q:

Build rViz on top of Melodic

I am trying to build rViz on top of melodic; but think I have some of the setup incorrect.
I have cloned rViz to
/home/brent/rosbuild_ws/src/rviz

I then ran
cd /home/brent/rosbuild_ws
rosws init . /opt/ros/melodic
rosdep install rviz
rosmake rviz

I see the below output which is generated in under 1 second; so I don't think anything is actually getting built.
Any tips on what is wrong with my setup would be most appreciated.

This code block was moved to the following github gist:

RViz has not been a rosbuild package for quite some time now.
You'll need to use Catkin to build RViz in a Catkin workspace.
In general the use of rosbuild has been deprecated for a long time. See also wiki/rosbuild.
I would recommend you always assume you have to use Catkin these days, unless the instructions specifically tell you otherwise.

Ok great
And it did seem strange to me; but I was following from http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/UserGuide Section 2.2 Build from source Are there updated build instructions anywhere that you are aware of?

I can't point you to anything RViz specific right now, but #q252478 should provide generic how-to-build-a-package-from-source-with-catkin instructions.
