Q:

Issue installing turtlebot3 simulation on ubuntu 16.04

I switched from ubuntu 14.04 to ubuntu 16.04 and try to completely remove ros indigo and install ros kinetic and gazebo9
I followed a guide to install .
This is a lists of my command on terminal:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git

git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git

git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git

cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make && source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

cd ..
catkin_make
This is the last part of output

Suggestions? I'm a newbie on ROS

A:

Yes i just saw that thread before posting here but after 2 hours of search i think that the problem in my case is that i still have indigo folder together with kinetic folder  in /opt/ros.
Obv i unistalled indigo (or maybe i try to remove it and all his dependencies) before start to install kinetic but i read somewhere it's very difficult .
In any case i have this folder and i can't delete.
Also during catkin_make now i have some warnings always like this:
CMake Warning at gazebo_ros_pkgs/gazebo_ros/CMakeLists.txt:72 (add_library):
Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target gazebo_ros_api_plugin
because there is a cycle in the constraint graph:
dir 0 is [/opt/ros/kinetic/lib]
  dir 2 must precede it due to runtime library [libroscpp.so]
dir 1 is [/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-7/plugins]
dir 2 is [/opt/ros/indigo/lib]
  dir 0 must precede it due to runtime library [libroslib.so]

Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.

EDIT:
ok, I solved brutally deleting indigo folder with root privileges. I don't know why unistall  leaves it
