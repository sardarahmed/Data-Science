Q:

where can I get a list of stack and variant for gen_rosinstall.py

Where can I get a list of variants or stacks per rosdistro?
In particular I would like to install desktop-pr2-full by source
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=electric&variant=desktop-full"
but that does not include the pr2 stacks. is there a variant for  desktop-pr2-full?
Thanks

A:

The list of variants for Electric are described in REP 113, and those for Diamondback in REP 108. I couldn't find a corresponding list for Fuerte.
The robot-specific variants are listed only in REP 108; the variant you are looking for is called pr2_desktop (also in Electric).
