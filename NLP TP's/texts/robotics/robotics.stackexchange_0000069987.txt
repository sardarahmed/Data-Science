Q:

Calibration pattern chessboard

Hi Ros users:
I am doing a calibration camera and I have to have a calibration pattern in Gazebo.
I like to know if there is a .stl calibration pattern chessboard file on the internet to do that.
And if there is not, how can I do it?
Thanks a lot.

Is this a duplicate of textures in a stl file?

both are fixed. Thanks

A:

You can render a checker/chessboard texture in gimp, export it as a png.

Or search for an existing one https://www.google.com/search?q=checkerboard+opencv&source=lnms&tbm=isch
Then create a plate model in Blender and apply the saved texture to a face using a tutorial like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POWq9aeDLls

Export the textured cube model as an obj, load it into meshlab, then export it as a dae (dae works better than stl in Gazebo).
