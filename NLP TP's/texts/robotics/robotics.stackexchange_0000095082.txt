Q:

WSL: Ubuntu on Windows 10, unable to see published topics

I'm am trying to work with ROS2-eloquent on Ubuntu for Windows 10.  I would like to create multiple nodes that can pass messages to one another while running independently in different terminals.  I can recreate my problem using the talker/listener demo nodes.
I open a new Ubuntu terminal in Windows 10.  Then I run tmux so that I can open multiple terminals in this instance of Ubuntu.  In the first tmux pane, I run
source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

The node prints the expected output.
Now i open a new pane in tmux and run
source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener

No output prints to the screen making me think that the listener is unable to subscribe to the topic that the talker is publishing.  Now I kill the listener and run
ros2 topic list

which only prints
/parameter_events
/rosout

and nothing prints for
ros2 topic list

All of this works find when I run this on Ubuntu 18.04 running natively.  I'm not familiar with how Ubuntu on Windows 10 operates under the hood and I would appreciate if anyone could help me solve this problem.

For the purposes of multi-machine setups, this will not work. It only allows for ROS2 to work internally withing WSL2.
