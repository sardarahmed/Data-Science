Q:

Joints of my model sway in gazebo

Hi everyone, the joints of my robot model start to sway when I spawn it in gazebo and then launch its controllers I added previously.
Here is the contents of my yaml file:

cambot:   # Publish all joint states
-----------------------------------   joint_state_controller:
type: joint_state_controller/JointStateController
publish_rate: 50
# Position Controllers ---------------------------------------   tilt_position_controller:
type: effort_controllers/JointPositionController
joint: tilt
pid: {p: 100.0, i: 0.01, d: 10.0}   pan_position_controller:
type: effort_controllers/JointPositionController
joint: pan
pid: {p: 100.0, i: 0.01, d: 10.0}   lift_position_controller:
type: effort_controllers/JointPositionController
joint: lift
pid: {p: 100.0, i: 0.01, d: 10.0}

And this is the contents of my launch file:

 
        file="$(find
cambot_description)/config/cambot_control.yaml"
command="load"/>

What am I supposed to do to avoid the sway situation mentioned above?

A:

You first probably want to tweak the controller PID parameters. This can be done at runtime using dynamic_reconfigure. I'd recommend dropping i and d gains to 0 and first adjusting p only. In most cases this adjustment is sufficient to make the robot "behave".
If your robot is hard to simulate correctly (for instance if it has very different masses/inertias of different links), then you might want to look at some other things to tweak as discussed in this Q/A and the links provided there.

Really appreciate your advice, sir. I do fix the problem by modifying the pid gains (even though I still can't comprehend the concept of pid).
