Q:

What does the "set 2D pose" function in rviz modfiy to change the pose?

Hi,
How does "set 2D pose" button in rviz work? When you set a pose using it the pose of the robot will stay on that. What is it changing to do that?
Thanks

A:

RVIZ will publish the pose on the 'initialpose' topic. Then your location node (perhaps AMCL) will know how to start the locating. Echo that topic in a terminal and then click the set button. You'll see the message get sent.
