Q:

FireFLY EGL config Problem

Hello there,  I'm running Ros lunar full desktop on this FireFly RK3399.  First problem, when i type into the terminal:
rosrun rviz rviz, it kicks up this error:
firefly@firefly:~$ rosrun rviz rviz
[ INFO] [1528702646.473572157]: rviz version 1.12.16
[ INFO] [1528702646.473719158]: compiled against Qt version 5.5.1
[ INFO] [1528702646.473746867]: compiled against OGRE version 1.9.0 (Ghadamon)
Cannot find EGLConfig, returning null config
Unable to find an X11 visual which matches EGL config 0
Could not initialize OpenGL for RasterGLSurface, reverting to RasterSurface.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Thanks for any insight you can provide,
Robert
PS the Firefly RK3399 is running Ubuntu 16.04 and it's a 64 bit OS

A:

Are you sure you have a working OpenGL driver for your computer, and that it is configured correctly? I'd suggest you go through http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Troubleshooting and update this question with the results.

Looking around for info on OpenGL and the RK3399 shows that this is not something that is easily setup, especially if you're not using the FireFly provided rootfs.

You were exactly right about OpenGL, It was running an image from them, and it was not installed. once I got it installed rviz works like a charm now.
Thank you so much for the help  :)
