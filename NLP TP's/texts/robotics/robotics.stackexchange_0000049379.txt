Q:

TimeSynchronizer too slow for PointCloud2 and LaserScan

I used messaged_filters to sync messages from a pointcloud2 topic and and a laserscan topic, process, and publish it. But the publish rate is too slow for it to be of any use, even without doing anything in the processing bit. About 5-8 seconds for each published.
Does anyone know any alternatives?

A:

Are the PointCloud2 and LaserScan coming from the same sensor?
If they are from separate sensors, you should try the Approximate timesync policy:
