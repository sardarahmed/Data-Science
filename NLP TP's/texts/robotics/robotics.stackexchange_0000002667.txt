Q:

Wine yard robotics?

My friend has acquired a (small) wine yard to discover how much work it is tending and harvesting the grapes.
Now we are musing to enlist robotic help. The vine stocks are usually connected by a stiff wire, so some dangling machine might be feasible.
We are looking for references/inspirations for an agricultural robotic vine assistant. Any ideas?
