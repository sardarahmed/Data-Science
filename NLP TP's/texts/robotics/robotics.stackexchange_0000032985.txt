Q:

interactive launch

Does ROS have a way to interactively start-stop nodes?
For example - taking a bunch of rosnodes and having a start-stop button next to each and showing their output?

Hi Dimitar,
I just started on something called rxlaunch, which does exactly that.  It's still in active development, but may already be useful to you.

You can get rxlaunch from its kforge page.  Just checkout the mercurial repository and run rxlaunch.py.  You may also need to install PySide.
Some things that don't work yet (2011-07-14):

It doesn't load parameters, so you should roslaunch the launch file first, then use rxlaunch (fixed 2011-07-14)
Everything is launched locally
It's hard-coded to use the master at http://localhost:11311

When things go wrong, just file a ticket.

Note: I just fixed anonymous checkouts.  Just run hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/rxlaunch/hg rxlaunch to get the code

Thanks for the feature request--I'll put it on my list

that is great, I might use it in the near future - meanwhile a UI comment: for some processes it might be usefull to see the standard output as part of the rxlaunch gui.

I'm making now rqt_launch, a roslaunch GUI based on rqt framework that's introduced since Groovy. http://www.ros.org/wiki/rqt_launch. As of today only source install is possible (from http://goo.gl/pC7Mv) but will soon be available in debian pkg.
