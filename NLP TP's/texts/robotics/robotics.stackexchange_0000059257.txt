Q:

robot_pose_ekf output to fake_localization

Hey,
I have robot_pose_ekf running and accepting wheel odometry and imu data and it is publishing on /robot_pose_ekf/odom just fine. I was wondering however what the idea of this output was, I was expecting nav_msgs/Odometry as output, because fake_localization takes this as input. Am I conceptually doing something wrong here?
Best regards,
Hans

A:

robot_pose_ekf produces a PoseWithCovarianceStamped message. This is due to the fact that robot_pose_ekf does not include linear or angular velocities in its state estimate; it only estimates the pose (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) of the robot. You should change your callbacks to accept PoseWithCovarianceStamped messages.
If you need an Odometry message, though, I would encourage you to try the robot_localization package.

I also have a similar problem. In order to change the callback to accept PoseWithCovarianceStamped, should I basically change the type of base_pose_ground_truth in this file ?

I'm afraid I'm not familiar with fake_localization. I'd ask this as a new question.

Thanks Tom. I switched to robot_localization and it seems to be working with fake_localization too
