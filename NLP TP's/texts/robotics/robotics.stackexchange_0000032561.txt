Q:

Problems using the given bag in the vlsam-tutorial

Hello
I've installed the vslam via

sudo apt-get install
ros-diamondback-vslam

and tried to run the bag file given in the tutorial
Tutorials/RunningVslamOnStereoData
If is start the bag-file I only get
[ERROR] [1309158942.182362673]: Client [/wide_stereo/stereo_vslam_node] wants topic /wide_stereo/right/camera_info to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/c9a58c1b0b154e0e6da7578cb991d214], but our version has [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/1b5cf7f984c229b6141ceb3a955aa18f]. Dropping connection.

Was there a change in the code which is not reflected in the bag-file?

Hi Nikolas,
I think I had the same problem: the bag file was probably recorded using cturtle and you are probably running diamondback. In any case, you may try to fix the bag file:
rosbag fix vslam_tutorial.bag vslam_tutorial_fixed.bag
and play it as follows:
rosbag play --clock vslam_tutorial_fixed.bag
Regards
Jordi
