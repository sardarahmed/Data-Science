Q:

Custom Messages for Ignition Transport

I'd like to use Ignition Transport in a new projects, and I want to be able to have custom messages. I understand ignition transport "uses protobuf". Should I generate the C++ classes and then register them with ignition transport somehow? What is the process for using custom messages types with ignition transport?
