Q:

How to fix ros::NodeHandle error?

This is my code snippet of curser.h
  1 #ifndef CURSER_H
  2 #define CURSER_H
  3 
  4 #include <iostream>
  5 #include <stdio.h>
  6 #include <ros/ros.h>
  7 #include<string>
  8 
  9 using namespace std;
 10 
 11 class Topic
 12 {
 13   
 14   public:
 15   //constructor
 16   ros::Nodehandle nh;
 17   ros::Subscriber sub;
 18 
 19   Topic(char *argv);
 20 
 21 };
 22 
 23 #endif

I am getting this error:

curser.h:16:8: error:  ‘Nodehandle’ in namespace ‘ros’ does not name a type

Could someone help me out with this please?
