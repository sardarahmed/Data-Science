Q:

turtlebot bringup android

[there's a question about this by ftrujillo on 27 oct 2013 but there's no answer. so i decided to bring this up again]
hello guys
I have a problem when bringing up the turtlebot. (just a warning)
after launching:
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal_with_appmanager.launch
the warning is:
[WARN] [WallTime: 1382834834.456361] Gateway : uuid's disabled, using possibly non-unique name [turtlebot]
I am using hydro as ROS version on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS precise.
I have been looking for this problem in the ROS answers and in the web but I cannot find nothing.
Then, some suggestions?
Thanks in advance.

A:

It is just a warning from app manager system underneath on turtlebot software. Don't worry about it. It would not cause any problem.
If you really want to eliminate the warning, you can configure this args in minimal_with_appmanager.launch.

It's only important to have unique id's (uuids) applied to the app manager if you are doing multi-robot rocon concerts where you can have namespace clashes.

thanks daniel. let's say there's a need to set the uuids, any guidance on how do i go about doing it?
