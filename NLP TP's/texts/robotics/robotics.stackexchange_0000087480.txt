Q:

catkin_make error melodic

I got this error after ran the catkin_make command line:
$ catkin_make
Base path: /home/user/catkin_ws

I am using ubuntu 17.10 and installed  version: ros melodic. Could someone help me to fit it.

Edit: Here my setup output as suggested from you:
$ ls -al /usr/bin/c++
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 21 Dec 25 22:30 /usr/bin/c++ -> /etc/alternatives/c++

and:
$ echo $CXX
/usr/bin/g++

Currently, I try to reinstall and do the same thing and make it different error output, like:

Edit2:
I am currently using catkin to install and it cannot detect the CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER. I tried to put all related files here for you to understanding my installation.

A:

Do you actually have a C++ compiler installed?
Try the following:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential

I would've assumed that would be installed automatically, but perhaps that is not true for your system.
Then rm -rf /home/user/catkin_ws/{build,devel} and try again.

Edit: and you can run /usr/bin/c++?

Edit2: your latest edit makes me wonder if you really do have a C++ compiler installed.
Please run:
sudo apt-get install build-essential g++

Then rm -rf /home/user/catkin_ws/{build,devel} and try again.

Comment by dlrlr on 2018-06-21:
Yes, I already install C++ compiler, I actually checked. I tried your instructions but don't work.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-06-21:
"don't work" is a bit vague. You cannot install the package, or even with that pkg it doesn't change the output of catkin_make?
Ignoring that: are you setting the CXX environment variable in your shell? What is the output of ls -al /usr/bin/c++? And of echo $CXX?
Comment by dlrlr on 2018-06-25:
Sorry to say, it didn't work
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-06-25:
Then why did you mark the question as answered?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-06-26:
I'm not sure what else to suggest. It seems there is a problem with CMake not being able to detect your C++ compiler.
Can you use CMake for C++ in a stand-alone project (ie: without ROS)?
