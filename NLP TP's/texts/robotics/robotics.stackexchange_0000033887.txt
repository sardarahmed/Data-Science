Q:

what does the intensity channel of a point cloud refer to?

From the rviz wiki, it seems intensity is related to colour? What type of information is encoded in the intensity of a point in a point cloud?

A:

This is typically a sensor-dependent "brightness" of return, representing some quality of measurement: energy returned, pixel value, etc.  Sometimes it can look like a greyscale brightness.  See the images on the right here to view some images produced by a laser scanner returning intensities.
Just be aware that sometimes it isn't human color dependent.  Some materials reflect IR laser beams very well but appear black to our eyes.
