Q:

Error using joystick_remapper

Hi, I'm trying to use the joystick_remapper, and I'm getting the following error every time I run the code:
[ERROR] [1349147615.365296561]: Client [/joystick2] wants topic /logitech to have datatype/md5sum [joy/Joy/e3ef016fcdf22397038b36036c66f7c8], but our version has [sensor_msgs/Joy/5a9ea5f83505693b71e785041e67a8bb]. Dropping connection.

My launch file looks like this:
<launch>

<node pkg="joy" type="joy_node" name="joystick1" >
  <remap from="joy" to="logitech" />
</node>

<node pkg="joystick_remapper" type="joystick_remapper.py" name="joystick2" >
  <remap from="joy_source" to="logitech" />
  <remap from="joy_des" to="joy" />
  <param name="button_mapping" type="str" value="=" />
  <param name="axis_mapping" type="str" value="=" />
</node>

</launch>

Can someone tell me how to make this work? Thanks!

Why is the node name in the error message joystick2? That name doesn't appear in the launch file.

I just named it...What should it be? I've tried other stuff, it doesn't seem to matter...unless its something specific that im missing...
