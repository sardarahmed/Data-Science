Q:

Rosjava - Launch another node from within rosjava node

Hello everyone,
I have an application on my android device that runs a rosjava node (the example pubsub node) on my robot.
Let's say I have another package X, implemented in C++. I create the node using
rosrun X Y

At the moment pubsub node is started, I want to get Y node started as well. (I assume I do that inside rosjava node)
I don't know how to do that. I appreciate any suggestion.

A:

It sounds like you're trying to make your nodes run in a specific order. That's generally a bad idea. Instead, a node should simply wait until the system is in the state it expects (e.g. a particular topic is being published).
