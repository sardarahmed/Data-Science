Q:

Missing FilterConfig.h for pcl_ros in Groovy

Using the instructions at http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Source, I am installing ROS on openSUSE 12.3, but I'm running into a snag when it builds the pcl_ros package:

<== Failed to process package 'pcl_ros': 
  Command '/home/abouchard/catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j2 -l2' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/abouchard/catkin_ws/build_isolated/pcl_ros && /home/abouchard/catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j2 -l2

Command failed, exiting.

I looked at filters.h, and it does have an include statement for FilterConfig.h, and it appears that there are several calls to functions in that namespace. I've found versions of the file online, but they appear to be rather dated, and I'm hesitant to just throw a file in there that might allow it to compile but will cause more problems when I try to use it that will make it harder to debug. In any case, the download probably needs to be reconfigured so that this file is included. Is there anyone here with insight into this package that might be able to offer some advice?

This file should be created because of cfg/Filter.cfg.

A:

change in pcl_ros/CMakeLists.txt the Line
add_dependencies(pcl_ros_tf pcl_ros_generate_messages_cpp {catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

to
add_dependencies(pcl_ros_tf pcl_ros_generate_messages_cpp {catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${PROJECT_NAME}_gencfg)

Thanks! The only add_dependencies line that I had was:
add_dependencies(pcl_ros_tf ros_gencpp pcl_ros_copy)
Regardless of the difference, I replaced it with the line you recommended and the package seems to have built successfully!
