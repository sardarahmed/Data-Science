Q:

Arduino and rosserial: reliable for industrial applications?

I'd like to run a ServiceServer on an Arduino board, but Googling around I'm not seeing a lot of success stories, just lots of posts about problems, with no solution. For example: this kind of thing.
This is for an industrial application, and we're looking for high-reliability.
Questions:

Should I forget about Arduino and just go straight to C/C++?
Anyone here have good experiences with Arduino and rosserial's ServiceServer?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

A:

My advice would be to change your application to use topics instead of services.
The paradigm is not the same but it is the fact that a service is blocking that make it less reliable with a serial link.
Rosserial with only topics seems reliable enough because it is already used by several companies.

That's exactly what I ended up doing (using topics instead of services). Thanks.
