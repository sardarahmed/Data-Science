Q:

Why is Kinect working but freenect.launch and openni.launch fail?

I have used Kinect with my own systems for years.  My installation works:
Right now using Lubuntu Xenial 16.04.1 64 bit.The Kinect system is:

OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.7.10    (built from source and patched to fix
a USB problem so the Kinect motor control works)

Sensor-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1

I would like to use ROS.  I installed packages from Synaptic:

ros-kinetic-freenect-stack
ros-kinetic-lib-freenect

I can launch the system, but Kinect device does not connect and no data is sent to rviz.
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch

I also tried installing from Synaptic:

ros-kinetic-openni-camera
ros-kinetic-openni-launch

Launching with roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch gives the following suspicious warnings:
Warning: USB events thread - failed to set priority. This might cause loss of data..

[ INFO] [1474760990.182270093]: Number devices connected: 2

[ INFO] [1474760990.283229629]: 1. device on bus 002:06 is a SensorKinect (2ae) from PrimeSense (45e) with serial id '0'

[ INFO] [1474760990.283294658]: 2. device on bus 002:06 is a SensorV2 (2ae) from PrimeSense (45e) with serial id 'A00361A13780044A'

Launching with roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch device_id:=A00361A13780044A selects the right device, but the Kinect does not connect and no data is sent to rviz.
I have uninstalled and re-installed the packages various times to no avail.  Surprisingly the ROS packages do not break my own installation, as they used to in the past.
I am at a complete loss as to how to debug this.  The more I read the documentation the more confused I get about the bewildering number of versions and alternative components that exist (often with very similar names).  Given that I have a working Kinect interface based on openni and avin driver, what can be going wrong ?  Is there a sure way to get this going from the repositories ?  Could my installation be breaking the ROS installation ?  Infuriatingly I believe that at the start both ROS and my installation were working simultaneously, but the something broke ROS.

I don't want to waste anyone's time on this.  I finally fixed the problem by fully removing and re-installing libfreenect-dev and libfreenect0.5 from the ubuntu repositories.

I have the same problem to read depth image from Kinect with ROS Kinetic. Could you please share steps to remove and install those libraries? Thanks in advance.
