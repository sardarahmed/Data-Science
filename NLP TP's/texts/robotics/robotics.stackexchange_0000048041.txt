Q:

[ERROR] Client wants topic /xxx but our version has /yyy

Hello all,
I am trying to execute some trajectories on my robot using the simple_trajectory.cpp tutorial.
I am able to see my controller using rostopic echo /r_arm_controller and it shows me everything I want. However when I execute my moves I get this error:
[ERROR] [1360184059.110097449]: Client [/right_joint_trajectory_action] wants topic /r_arm_controller/joint_trajectory_action/goal to have datatype/md5sum [control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionGoal/8f3e00277a7b5b7c60e1ac5be35ddfa2], but our version has [pr2_controllers_msgs/JointTrajectoryActionGoal/aee77e81e3afb8d91af4939d603609d8]. Dropping connection.

It looks pretty self explanitory but I wanted some claification. So my action server uses [control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionGoal] for topic of publishing on and my action client uses [pr2_controllers_msgs/JointTrajectoryActionGoal]. Which of these should I conform to?
I am not using a pr2 robot so I am thinking of using control_msgs, but I want to know if one is better than the other. Thanks in advance.
Kind Regards,
Martin

A:

I found the answer, the pr2_controller_msgs/JointTrajectoryActionGoal is an old method of using the joint trajectory action control. I changed over the tutorial code to use:
#include <control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryAction.h>

instead of:
#include <pr2_controllers_msgs/JointTrajectoryAction.h>

and any calls like:
pr2_controllers_msgs::JointTrajectoryGoal 

to:
control_msgs::FollowJointTrajectoryGoal

Works fine but now I'm encountering a different run-time error, however I don't know the cause of this one yet. I will try to update if I find an answer!
Regards,
Martin
