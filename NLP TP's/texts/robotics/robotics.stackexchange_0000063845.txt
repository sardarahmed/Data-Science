Hi,
It is possible to handle multiple vehicles, please have a look at shipwreck.xml scene, where two vehicles are placed in the scene and can be controlled through "/dataNavigator_G500TRIDENT" and "/dataNavigator_G500RAUVI". Not sure where is the error is in your case, your config file looks OK.
By now it is not possible to spawn vehicles, we are working on it.
