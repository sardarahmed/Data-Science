Q:

running fuerte packages on electric

Hi,
I have not yet made the conversion to fuerte (still using electric) but I wanted to use the Gazebo 1.0 package that was released in fuerte.  Is there a way of doing this or is there another easy method of running Gazebo 1.0 on electric?
Thanks

A:

There is certainly no easy way.
You can check out the Fuerte version of the Gazebo sources and try to backport it to Electric. Anticipate many build and integration problems.

Thanks for the quick reply.  That describes the experience I had been having attempting this, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing out on some hidden ros feature, I think my best bet is just to upgrade to Fuerte.

Yes. Getting gazebo 1.0 to build and run on Electric is hard enough. Then, you'd likely find other packages in Electric that require the older gazebo version.
