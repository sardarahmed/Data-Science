Q:

Two ROS computers - roswtf: WARNING The following nodes are unexpectedly connected:

I'm unable to publish on /turtle1/cmd_vel with second controller computer, but it works fine on 1 computer. It works fine to send /clear service commands on 1 and 2 computer configurations.
Controller computer name computer2, node name is /rmdmia
Running Turtlesim on computer name computer1.
The following is output from roswtf:
WARNING The following nodes are unexpectedly connected:

unknown (http://computer2:51117/)->/turtlesim (/turtle1/cmd_vel)

Found 1 error(s).
ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:

/controlnode->/turtlesim (/turtle1/cmd_vel)

It appears to be a DNS issue, but I've set up the hosts file in both systems with each computer's ethernet ip address, set the ros_ip, and ros_hostname on computer1, and set the ros_master_uri on both systems to the hostname, instead of localhost. Any idea where the configuration is wrong?
Thanks,
Aaron

A:

It turned out to be an XMLRPC problem. The requestTopic method had a variable that always made the address localhost, and therefore the publisher worked on localhost, and subscribers, and services always seemed to work.
Thanks,

I'm a bit confused: normal ROS setups never have to change anything in XMLRPC libraries. All configuration is done using ROS_IP, ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_MASTER_URI (as suggested by @TomSon). For two PCs and no working DNS, set ROS_IPon both and ROS_MASTER_URI to the IP of roscore machine.

You are correct that it is not a normal ROS setup. I am a developer, and it was a client I've been developing.
