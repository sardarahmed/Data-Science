Q:

Servo controlled valve

I am trying to build a servo-controlled water valve.  Max pressure 150 psi , valve size 1/2".
Can anyone recommend a suitable 1/4-turn valve, either ceramic, ball valve, or anything else that is easy to turn, even under pressure? It must require very little torque to turn, so a standard servo can rotate it with a small lever attached.

A:

It is pretty common to take a simple and cheap solenoid valve and use a PWM at the input
TI  has a pretty nice driver (DRV102) which uses a analog input and provides enough power to switch the most valves. I don't even need a MCU, just a variable resistor is enought
Then just take a cheap valve and the job is done
