Hi,
While running apt-get update on Ubuntu12.04, the error
Err http://packages.namniart.com precise Release.gpg
Could not resolve 'packages.namniart.com'
Fetched 2,855 kB in 30s (94.9 kB/s)
Reading package lists... Done
W: Failed to fetch http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros/dists/precise/Release.gpg  Could not resolve 'packages.namniart.com'
was given, while packages.namniart.com is reachable. Any idea ?

A:

It sounds like you have a network or DNS problem.
Can you ping packages.namniart.com from your board? If that doesn't work, can you ping www.google.com?

Yes, I can ping both from the board.

Try again and see if it was a fluke? Otherwise this sounds like it's an issue specific to apt.
Comment by hvn on 2014-03-20:
I tried three times, both namniart and google. All pings work. Remarkable is that apt-get install start well and downloads the package, but stalls after that. Even kill -9 doesn't kill it. The failure of roscore (my original problem) has nothing to do with apt or Ubuntu, right ?

I suspect they're both symptoms of the same underlying problem. Perhaps the disk is full? Have you looked at the kernel logs at all?
Comment by hvn on 2014-03-20:
Could be. Disk is at 57%, so no problem there. Kernel logs show nothing wrong so far. Will check further.

Reading this in the log:
[xmlrpc][INFO] 2014-03-26 10:13:51,179: XML-RPC server binding to 0.0.0.0:0
[xmlrpc][INFO] 2014-03-26 10:13:51,182: Started XML-RPC server [http://BBxM:48536/]
[xmlrpc][INFO] 2014-03-26 10:13:51,184: xml rpc node: starting XML-RPC server
Is this correct ?

Does the hostname BBxM resolve on you machine? What IP address does it resolve to?
Comment by hvn on 2014-03-26:
Yes it does. ping BBxM resolves to 127.0.1.1 which is set in /etc/hosts.

I was suggested to test ROS Indigo to see if that would work better, but when looking for it, I think it's not even available for armhf yet. Apart from that, I doubt it's even compatible with Ubuntu Precise. Or is it ?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-04-02:
There are no armhf debs for Indigo yet; sorry. Indigo is also not supported on Ubuntu versions before 13.10.
