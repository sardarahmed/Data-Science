Q:

Ros + openstreetmap (osm cartography package)

Hi,
Is anyone knows how to work with ROS and Open Street Map ? I have ROS indigo.
The package is here:
http://wiki.ros.org/osm_cartography
I would like to have something like on this picture:
image description http://wiki.ros.org/osm_cartography?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=prc-rviz-small.png
My code for now is the following but doesn't work:
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 
ros::init(argc, argv, "osm");
ros::NodeHandle n;
ros::ServiceClient client = n.serviceClient<geographic_msgs::GetGeographicMap>("geographic_msgs");
geographic_msgs::GetGeographicMap srv;

srv.request.url = "package://home/user/map.osm";
if(client.call(srv))
{
     ROS_INFO("connected");
}
else
{
     ROS_ERROR("failed");

}

return 0;

}
Thanks you so much in advance.

after lunching the file, it does not show any picture. Should I run RViz and then what should add in Rviz?

A:

That package comes with a demo launch file (source) which starts the visualization, and you could start from there.
