Q:

[SOLVED] Rviz plugin editing

Hi all,
my question is very simple but I didn't find something similar in the forum. I need to implement 3d motion planning for a tracked vehicle equipped with a laser scanner. I'm using ROS because I want to specify, through Rviz, waypoints during the path execution. I found there is an Rviz plugin called PlantFlagTool, which is really what I need to use. Of course, this plugin needs some changes so I'd like to create a ROS-package and edit the code. Please, can someone explain me how to do this?
Thanks

Solved! I was using catkin, creating a package with rosbuild turned out to be the right choice!
