Q:

what kind of interface will it be if I use Ethernet-to-USB adapter to connect raspberry pi and Jetson?

This may be a general question, but I want to know what type of interface will an Ethnet-to-USB connection make on both a server side and a client side. I think that on the server side, whose port is USB, it has to be a serial interface, but I'm not sure about the client side whose Ethernet will be connected. And has this connection ever been used in the ROS application? I appreciate for anybody who knows well about this issue.

A:

Are you referring to USB ethernet dongles? If so: that's a regular network card (NIC) as far as the OS is concerned.

So then it is network-based connection, right? Not serial connection...

Well, if your answer to my question is 'yes', then yes, it's a plain NIC, so depending on the protocols that you have configured to run over it, it would be TCP or UDP (or something else).
But definitely not serial, no.
