Q:

Setting up Catkin Baxter Environment Error - INDIGO

Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTE
I'm trying to setup a workspace to simulate Baxter in gazebo with Ros Indigo. When I run catkin_make in my workspace i get the following error:
[100%] Building CXX object baxter_simulator/baxter_sim_hardware/CMakeFiles/baxter_emulator.dir/src/baxter_emulator.cpp.o

This error has been haunting me for the past three days...

A:

I'm fairly certain that your error is related to catkin finding the wrong version of OpenCV. Do you by any chance have ros-indigo-opencv3 installed? You can check with dpkg -l |grep ros-indigo-opencv3. If it is installed, try removing with sudo apt-get remove ros-indigo-opencv3. If it is not installed, have you built OpenCV 3 from source? Or completed some other procedure to install it?
