Q:

Display an OGRE mesh and material in RVIZ

I'd like to display an OGRE mesh with a material in RVIZ but I'm having some difficulty. I can display the mesh by itself (without a material) by using the mesh_resource marker message. However, I can't figure out a way to get the material to display as well.
The mesh_resource marker message supports "embedded" materials which I have gotten to work with COLLADA files. Does anyone have suggestions for either converting the ogre mesh/material to a COLLADA .dae file or for getting the ogre mesh/material to work directly?
Thanks!

A:

Ogre has a script to import ogre meshes into blender. Blender can then export collada.
