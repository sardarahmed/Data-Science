Q:

catkin command passes with non-existent ROS package "pcl"

In pcl tutorial,
catkin_create_pkg my_pcl_tutorial pcl pcl_ros roscpp sensor_msgs

AFAIK there's no package called pcl in hydro, and catkin_create_pkg only takes catkin packages as an argument, but this command passes without errors and creates a package. Why is it?

A:

Hello!
When you call catkin_create_pkg it just lists everything after the package name as a dependency in the package.xml file, so you could probably put anything in there and it would at least successfully run that command. It may not actually compile once you get to the catkin_make step.
Also as a side note: PCL is the Point Cloud Library, and the ros package for it is called ros-hydro-pcl-ros in your package manager (assuming you're using Ubuntu).

Added to that, the upstream PCL package is called pcl, which is a valid rosdep dependency.
