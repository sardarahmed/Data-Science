Q:

Errors while installing ros-groovy on beablebone with ubuntu 12.10

I am trying hard to install ROS groovy from the source on a beaglebone board which has installed the Ubuntu 12.10 by following the the instructions on this page: http:// ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Source
Everything was working well until it got some errors with building the catkin Packages as cited below. I would therefore be grateful to receive some suggestions on how you propose to solve this problem.

A:

From looking at the full output, it looks like most packages downloaded successfully, and a few failed.
Try running with -j1 instead of -j8; I suspect that your system can't handle the load of running 8 simultaneous downloads.
You may also want to consult the ARM Installation and Raspbian Installation instructions, since your system is ARM, and most of the tweaks required to install on Raspberry Pi also apply to other ARM systems.

I don't think what you suggested before was the main issue since I got the following output with ifconfig and ping http://pastebin.com/iFXHqdXP . In addition, if it helps, the complete terminal output is available at http://pastebin.com/LbTPaXYU

The complete output is quite helpful; thanks! It looks like your internet connection is working, and only a few packages failed; probably due to high load somewhere.

Thank you very much for the extra information. Apropos, it worked very well with $ wstool init src -j1 packages http:// packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/ros_comm
