Q:

Warnings encountered while simulating erratic

Hi.I am using ROS fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04.  While I was running erratic on gazebo, using
 roslaunch erratic_navigation_apps demo_2dnav_slam.launch  

I encountered the following warnings.
[ WARN] [1354625870.495205787, 49.740000000]: Message from  
[/base_laser_self_filter] has a non-fully-qualified frame_id [base_footprint].  
Resolved locally to [/base_footprint].  This is will likely not work in 
multi-robot systems.  This message will only print once.

seconds.

My question is how should I get rid of the warning for observation buffer. Thank you.

Are you running link:this. I do not even get a robot spawned using the direct instructions. Did you change the robot description from urdf to sdf format?

Hi Shanker. No i did not change the robot description.

A:

I suspect that you don't have enough CPU cycles and that as a result some part of the system is running slower than expected.  Off-hand, I'm not sure whether it would be Gazebo itself (including plugins) or one of the ROS nodes.
In any case, have a look at your system load (e.g., with top).  If your system is very busy, try having Gazebo run slower: lower <update_rate> in the .world file that you're using.

Thanks gerkey, i will try that. Looking back, I did realised that my PC will lag sometime when I run simulation.
