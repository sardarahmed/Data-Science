Please be more specific. For instance, provide the exact steps you did when getting the error message. Please read http://ros.org/wiki/Support

A:

What are you trying to do? You don't need to use apt-get to create a workspace. Are you sure you did all the tutorials here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
To use apt-get to install packages, you have to have sudo-rights, so you will have to ask your admin to install packages... However, to create a ROS workspace, you don't need it anyway...
