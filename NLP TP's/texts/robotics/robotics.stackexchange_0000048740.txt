Q:

cannot make image_view from source on gumstix Overo

Hi everyone,
I am trying to make image_view(fuerte version) from source on gumstix Overo(running Linaro).
But I got the following error:
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> cv_bridge [ make ]                                     
[ rosmake ] All 27 linesv_bridge: 116.7 sec ]         [ 1 Active 4/17 Complete ]

  Perhaps you should add the directory containing `opencv.pc'

to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'opencv' found
  CMake Error at /root/ros_core_ws/install/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:129 (message):

    Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
    broken dependency!

  Call Stack (most recent call first):
    /root/ros_core_ws/install/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:227 (rosbuild_invoke_rospack)
    CMakeLists.txt:12 (rosbuild_init)
  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

It seems the third party package opencv2 haven't been installed. I tried install it by "rosdep install image_view", but I got following error:
root@linaro-alip:~# rosdep install image_view
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:
image_view: Missing resource smclib
ROS path [0]=/root/ros_core_ws/install/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/root/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/root/ros_core_ws/install/share
ROS path [3]=/root/ros_core_ws/install/stacks

Do I need to install smclib by source?
Also, I have downloaded and make the opencv, can I simply make install it and then can rosmake find 'opencv'?
Thanks in advance!
