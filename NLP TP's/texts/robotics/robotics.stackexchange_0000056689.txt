Q:

can't use urdf.vcg file in urdf_tutorial

when I type the roslaunch to try to run the package I create before, the terminal showed that:
ERROR: the config file '/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/robot_model_tutorials/urdf_tutorial/urdf.vcg' is a .vcg file, which is the old rviz config format.
I can't understand how to change the file, cause I didn't change the content of the urdf_tutorial since I downloaded from ROS. I have no idea about this....is there someone could help me, thanks so much for your time!

A:

You should update the launch file to use the urdf.rviz instead of the urdf.vcg
