Q:

need help converting lat-long coordinates into meters

I have a bunch of coordinates captured from my gps in lat-long coordinates, the formatting is like so:
lat: 43.47798167 # Latitude (degrees). Positive is north of equator; negative is south.
long: -80.545065 # Longitude (degrees). Positive is east of prime meridian, negative west.
I'm simply getting this data from my /fix topic, or gps_common/GPSFix.msg. I want to convert all of my lat-long coord's to meters.
For example, this is position 1:
lat: 43.47798167,
long: -80.545065
This is position 2:
lat: 43.47784167,
long: -80.54544833
What's the distance traveled in meters from position 1 to 2 in the x and y directions?
Thanks.

A:

The geodesy package provides interfaces to convert between lat/long and UTM coordinates in both C++ and Python. Once points are converted to UTM, you can use normal Euclidean distance calculations in meters.
It uses proj4 for the Python implementation, and handles conversion to and from the standard ROS sensor_msgs/NavSatFix.
