Hi somebodyus ,
http://www.pibot.org/  fully open source robotic platform

A:

What comes to my mind are Poppy and iCub. They are "mobile" but in a different way. If you are only interested about mobile bases with wheels, I think Turtlebot 2 is as close as it gets to open source (open source stops at the software level).
