Q:

What's this cuboid at rqt_graph?

I use robot arm(Ufactory Lite6), and I got rqt_graph.
In the graph, nodes are showed by ellipses and topics are showed by rectangle. However, there are cuboid among them.
what is this cuboid? Please tell me.
At nodes only mode, we can watch "/ufactory/lite6_traj_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/status&goal (rectangle)".
At nodes and topics(All) mode, we can watch "/ufactory/lite6_traj_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/action_topics (cuboid)", not "status&goal".
What is the relationship between "status&goal"and "action_topics"? Please tell me.
Nodes only mode.

Node and topics(All) mode.

Pedantic perhaps, but a cuboid is 3D. rqt_graph is pretty fancy, but it's not a 3D program (yet).

A:

An ActionServer/ActionClient communicate with each other using 5 ros topics with specific names: cancel, feedback, goal, result, status.
That box is removing clutter from the diagram by not explicitly listing these 5 well-known topic names.
See http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib for a poorly-written description of actionlib.
