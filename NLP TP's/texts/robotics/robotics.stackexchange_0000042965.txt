Q:

Where is wide.launch in stereo_image_proc package?

I followed Stereo Processing in Simulation.
I run:
  roslaunch gazebo_worlds simple_world.launch
  roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch

Then I run:
  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/test$ roslaunch stereo_image_proc wide.launch
  cannot locate [wide.launch] in package [stereo_image_proc]
  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/test$  

Where is wide.launch?
Or what's the substitute?
Thank you~

A:

Sorry for the confusion, I may delete the tutorial as the stereo_image_procs are started by default when you
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch

But, you can look in the dual stereo camera launch file and find the nodes that starts up the stereo image proc nodes.
