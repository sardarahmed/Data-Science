Q:

Can I remove build and devel folders

I just followed the doc to install ROS1 from source.
After the installation, I got three folders: build_isolated devel_isolated install_isolated, then I execute source install_isolated/setup.bash. Now the installation of ROS has been done.
My question is if I can remove build_isolated and devel_isolated?
The doc says:

The build folder is where cmake and
make are invoked, and the devel folder
contains any generated files and
targets, plus setup.*sh files so that
you can use it like it is installed.

I'm not sure if I can remove them.

A:

This will depend:

if you're going to add more packages to your "base ROS install", then keeping the build and devel folders around might reduce build times, as depending on what those new packages need, certain pkgs that are dependencies will need to be rebuilt.

if you're not going to add any packages (that would be a rare situation, but can happen), or are going to create an overlay workspace (recommended for source installs), then the build and devel (and their _isolated variants) can be removed. As long as the overlay workspace extends the install space of the underlay, of course.

Finally: a general tip for working with source installs: enable ccache. Even if you need to rebuild large parts of your base workspace, it'll be very fast, especially in cases where not a lot of files have been updated / changed.
