Q:

rqt --list-plugins is empty even though I have some installed

I have installed ros-indigo-rqt-common-plugins, but when I run rqt --list-plugins, it does not show anything. What is the problem?
Note:
I know the answer and am in the process of posting it. I didn't see a good place to add this to the ROS wiki, so I'm posting it here.

A:

My rqt configuration file in ~/.config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini was out-dated, possibly because I upgraded my machine to trusty instead of doing a clean install. I deleted the old configuration file, and that fixed the problem.

+1. Btw did you try with the option like $ rqt --force-discover as suggested in the tutorial?

That tutorial is titled "Create your new rqt plugin", so I didn't read it. I was just trying to use rqt_plot and none of the plugins were showing up.
