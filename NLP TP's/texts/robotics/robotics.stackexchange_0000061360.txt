Q:

how to save rgb image and depth image

Hi all,
I would like to record a scene and save depth image + rgb image and point cloud data of the kinect sensor automatically into disk in jpg or png format.
I use RGBDSLAM to collect the data.And I want :
The color images are stored as 640×480 8-bit RGB images .
The depth maps are stored as 640×480 16-bit monochrome images.
But, I have no idea to do this.
Hope for your answer.

A:

maybe the image_saver node that comes with image_view will let you do this. Not sure what you use rgbdslam for.
