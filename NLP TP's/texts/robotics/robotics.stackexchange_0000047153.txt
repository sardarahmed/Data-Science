Q:

Catkin and eclipse

Hello,
i am using ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04.
I want edit my packages in eclipse. On Fuerte i runed make eclipse-project and import this result as eclipse project.
At groovy i can include my catkin workspace as project. This is working.
But now i have a problems with my includes.
#include "ros/ros.h"

warning: Unresolved inclusion.

Or
ROS_INFO("text") error: Type 'std_msgs::String::ConstPtr' could not be resolved

and i couldnt see with crtl + mouse the functions.
What i do wrong ? what i must edit in eclipse that this is working?
thank you for your help

A:

Here is how I do this. Go to your workspace directory and run catkin_make with options to generate eclipse project files:

cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"

The project files will be generated in the build/ folder. Now source the workspace setup and start eclipse from the terminal:

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
eclipse

This allows eclipse to get the correct environment to be able to build from within eclipse. Now import the project from the build/ folder. Eclipse provides a link named "Source directory" within the project so that you can edit the source code. Using this method, the indexer resolves all symbols correctly, and Eclipse is also able to build the workspace successfully.

thank you for the answer i can build my project in eclipse now. But in source directory in my files i have stille the problem that my functions could not be resolved. For example Function 'ROS_INFO_STREAM' could not be resolved. But i can build it. I dont understand why.

Is it possible that i must change my library path manuel? that he can resolve this?

This should work out of the box. Go to Project Properties -> C++ Include Paths, and make sure that all the required ROS include directories are present, like /opt/ros/groovy/include. Also try rebuilding the index if it's never been done before (Right click on project -> Index -> Rebuild).

If I execute /catkin_make -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"/ then the action is just normal catkin_make and no eclipse project is created. Any ideas why? Or how to find the eclipse project in build/? I can't see anything new.

Do you see the .project and .cproject files in the build/ directory? These are what allow Eclipse to import the project, using File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace, and then select the build directory. It should then show you the auto-generated project which you can import.
Comment by r0nald on 2013-01-29:
No .project or .cproject anywhere.
Comment by r0nald on 2013-01-29:
The problem was, that if all projects were compiled, then catkin_make did not invoke cmake and cmake did not get the command to make eclipse files. Eclipse files get generated if catkin_make clean was done previously or if I force cmake with the -force-cmake flag.

Thanks for the information. I've updated the answer above to include --force-cmake.

For a better result, create a Makefile project with the generated Makefile. This will resolve system include path problem (e.g. /../c++/4.6, ...).
PS In project settings, we can change Build behavior from "all" to "-j8 -l8" to make it faster to compile.

@kalakris Thx for the great method! 2 clarifications that worked for me: (1) A single .project is to be generated under /build directly (I first looked for /build/%EACH_PKG%. (2) To "import" projects, instead of "File-->import", use "File-->New-->C++ Project" and specify the projects' directory.

I cant find any .project even after executing the above commands. When I try to import the project it only find one project in catkin_ws directory which is Project@build(/home/username/catkin_ws/build . Should not it generate a separate project for each package in my catkin_ws directory.

For each CMake invocation you will get one Eclipse project. So when you invoke it on a catkin workspace you will get one project for the whole workspace.

@Mudassir Khan, @r0nald remember that to show hidden files in your file manager since .project and .cproject they begin with a '.' and are thus hidden by default
