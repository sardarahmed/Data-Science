Q:

how to advertise set_camera_info service?

I have been trying to calibrate my camera using monocularcalibration node and it seems to be working fine. Now I have published my cameraInfo message but it ends up with an error saying set_camera_info service unavailable.
I tried to look into it and I found that I have to advertise this service using advertiseService() but I have some doubts.
I am using diamondback and I found a sensor_msgs::SetCameraInfo is the service provided. But somewhere I can also read that this service is controlled by camera_info_manager. But for diamondback it has been moved to image_common as per REP 104. It also talks about camera_parameter_parsers. I am confused how to proceed with this now. Does somebody have any idea about which package to be used exactly ?
My guess is that I have to somehow advertise the set_camera_info service but I am not sure if thats all is required by the calibration node or it also need camera_parameter_parser ?

A:

I recommend using camera_info_manager.
It will advertise the service for you, provide up-to-date CameraInfo data for you to publish, and store the updated calibration information. It uses camera_calibration_parsers, internally, so you need not worry about that.
