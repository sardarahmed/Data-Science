Q:

Ros tutorial problem - roscd

I create a ros package, while I us roscd that cannot find it.
sunli@sunli-ThinkPad-T410:~/catkin_ws/src$ roscd begin_tutorials
roscd: No such package/stack 'begin_tutorials'
Then, I use rosws set,
sunli@sunli-ThinkPad-T410:~/catkin_ws/src$ rosws set beginner_tutorials
ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.
This problem often occurs and sometime I can fix it but I dont know what's the exact reason?
Thanks a lot!
