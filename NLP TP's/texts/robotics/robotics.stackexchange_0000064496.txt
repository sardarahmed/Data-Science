Q:

Catkin_make complains about non-existing CMakeLists.txt

I'm encountering a really strange error: catkin_make complains about a non-existing CMakeLists.txt:
andreas@andreas-lab: catkin_make install
Base path: /home/andreas/baxter_ws
Source space: /home/andreas/baxter_ws/src
Build space: /home/andreas/baxter_ws/build
Devel space: /home/andreas/baxter_ws/devel
Install space: /home/andreas/baxter_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "cmake /home/andreas/baxter_ws/src -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/home/andreas/baxter_ws/devel -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/andreas/baxter_ws/install" in "/home/andreas/baxter_ws/build"
####
CMake Error: The source directory "/home/andreas/baxter_ws/src" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI.
Invoking "cmake" failed

However, the CMakeLists.txt file is clearly there:
andreas@andreas-lab: ls -1 src/
baxter
baxter_common
baxter_examples
baxter_interface
baxter_tools
CMakeLists.txt

A:

Try running catkin_init_workspace in our catkin_ws/src folder.... Is the CMakelists.txt really a sym link to top-level cmake as it should be (Asure with ll)?
$ ll
.......
CMakeLists.txt -> /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake  
.......
