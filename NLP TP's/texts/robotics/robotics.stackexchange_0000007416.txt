Q:

Artificial Intelligence Software Packages: Professionals, University education is oft' a step behind. What's actually being used?

Currently using Windows 8, what software packages for artificial intelligence programming (robotics branch) are used in today's professional environment as standard. Lots of internet suggestions, but companies seem to keep this a closely guarded secret. And are the internet rumors true? Would switching to Ubuntu offer me more in terms of depth.
Context: Educational field: Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, current focus (though obviously experience in others) in programming languages stands at c++, C and Python. Looking to build, program and develop a human-like bot (NOT aiming for singularity at this point ;))and am asking this question in order to build my toolbox a little. 

A:

I am not sure which end of the AI work you intended, so this may not apply. If you are working disconnected from hardware one might be better off with straight MATLAB / Octave.
If you are planning to demonstrate on hardware, the widest robotics control architecture / middleware is ROS which was the DARPA funded Player/Stage / Gazebo. There are many middlewares based on CORBA as the main alternatives. It has interfaces for all your language preferences.  http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/
ROS has sort of won the OS wars in robotics.  People clung to ACE TAO/ MIRO/ OROCOS / CORBA middlewares until they - mostly - accepted that ORBs are flexible but bloated producing bloated cores. The telling feature of all this collected effort is ROS' widest device driver array for sensors and robot chassis you will find:

It might be better to dual boot that machine to Ubuntu and slowly acclimatize. ROS has native Ubuntu .apts.  I dual-booted my first machine in 2003 and have never looked back. Nor rebooted the Windows partition either... Best of luck!
