Q:

Where to learn ROS?

I am trying to learn ROS and so I was looking for some guide or tutorial series. I already managed to set up ROS Kinetic on a Raspberry Pi and ROS Noetic on a Ubuntu VM. I am quite experienced in Python and just need to learn ROS. Where is a good place to start. All the places I looked at were paid. I also have a basic robot setup with a L298N, 2 DC motors, and a camera.

A:

In addition to the ROS tutorials already mentioned by Akhil Kurup, Robotis has a list of resources here. There are YT videos and a free e-book. Some of them are centered around their Turtlebot kit, but there are also general ROS info.
