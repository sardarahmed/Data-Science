Q:

Is it possible to use relative path for mesh filename in URDF?

I have my mesh STL in the same directory as my URDF so I was hoping I could reference it via a relative path.
This works as expected
<mesh filename="package://urdf_tutorial/urdf/Assy_X.stl" />

But I would like to do something like this
<mesh filename="file://Assy_X.stl" />
  or this
<mesh filename="file://./Assy_X.stl" />

Where it assumes the mesh path is relative to the URDF path.
Is this possible somehow?

A:

While not a perfect answer to my original question as it requires a one time adjustment to a launch file, this post (http://answers.ros.org/question/38956/pass-parameters-to-xacro-in-launch-file/) helped solve my problem pretty well by allowing me to pass an argument to the xacro, which can then be used in the xacro.
This allows the urdf/xacro to be oblivious to its location as the launch file will ensure it knows where to find the STL & DAE files I specify.
Added "meshDirectory" argument to the launch file
<launch>
    <arg name="model" default="$(find urdf_tutorial)/urdf/test2.xacro meshDirectory:=$(find urdf_tutorial)/urdf/" />

Used it like this in .xacro
<geometry>
    <mesh filename="file://$(arg meshDirectory)Assy_X-1.stl" />
</geometry>
