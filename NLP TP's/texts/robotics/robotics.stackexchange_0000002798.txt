Q:

Why does iRobot not sell the Create in Europe?

I'm trying to find a good beginners platform to use ROS with, and I came across the iRobot Create. To my surprise, they do not sell in Europe. Why is that?

A:

I believe the Create was not sold in Europe because it is not RoHS compliant.
However, every Roomba can be hacked.  You can communicate with the robot with the "Open Interface" or sometimes called the "Serial Control Interface".  There is lots of information about this on the web.  See here for example: http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf
Note that you will need to either make or buy a cable to connect to the 7 pin mini-DIN port on the robot.  Every Roomba has this.  Sometimes it is under the faceplate though.
Most libraries you can find online communicate with the Roomba outlined above and do not use the "Command Module" that was unique to the Create.
