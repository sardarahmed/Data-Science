Q:

odometry Tutorial and Rviz

I'm working through the http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom tutorial. I have the code running so it is publishing odometry info. I have also done the URDF_tutorial so I have a model of my robot that I can see in Rviz. If I run both of these at the same time should I see the robot running around in circles in Rviz? Is it not that simple or does Rviz not work that way?

A:

If you are publishing the transformation between your robot and the odometry, yes. So if your robot has the base called /base_link, your odometry should publish from /odom to /base_link and of course broadcast this transformation in tf.

THanks, I got it . The trick was to change the Fixed Frame to odom, then it started moving.
