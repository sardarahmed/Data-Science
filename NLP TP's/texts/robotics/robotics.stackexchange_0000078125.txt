Q:

Guide to helping with mapping using laser data

Hi guys,
does anyone here know about some kind of tutorial where I can learn how to use laser data to build a map.
I've recently been working on an EKF SLAM algorithm project, but I have no idea how to build a map using sensor data.
Any help would be really appreciated.
