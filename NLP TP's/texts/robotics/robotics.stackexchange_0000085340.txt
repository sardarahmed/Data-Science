Q:

Assign geometry_msgs::position in one line

HI,
I am struggling with a really easy problem. I declared :
geometry_msgs::Pose pose_msg;

I am trying to assign x y z coordinates in one line instead of doing:
pose_msg.position.x = 0.0;
pose_msg.position.y = 0.0;
pose_msg.position.z = 0.0;

I would like to do something like:
pose_msg.position = (0.0,0.0,0.0)

Sorry if the question has been already asked but for me, it was hard to find an answer online.
Thanks in advance for your help

A:

With the default messages, this is not supported.
With the merge of ros/gencpp#32 this is now possible (after gencpp version 0.6.0 has been released), but will need custom code.
See wiki/roscpp/Overview/MessagesSerializationAndAdaptingTypes - Customizing generated message headers for C++ for more info on this.
