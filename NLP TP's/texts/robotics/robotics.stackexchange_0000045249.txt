hey, i got some problems with getting my turtlebot started.

have and ubuntu 11.10 running with ros on asus eeepc.
started with the turotials at ROS Turtlebot Tutorial
at  the tutorial turtlebot_bringup i got the error Failed to open port /dev/ttyUSB0

to be a bit mor clear i tried rostopic echo /diagnostics whitch presents me this message as well as the Dashoard as well as if i type roslaunch turtlebot-bringup minimal.launch
4.i tried to solf this problem using with this possible solutions

but nothing changed
again more clear i changed the chmod of /dev/ttyUSB0, i tried udev rules, i have tested if there is an connection to this port with lsusb and dmesg | grep usb as well ass  cd /dev/serial/by_id/ ls -al.
All confirm me my serial device converter (needed for the connection from pc to rommba cleaner) is attached to ttyUSB0
My anybody got some advices for me?

First, post the output of the commands. Second, try opening the port in gtkterm or similar (or even cat first) to see if it can be opened in principle and send some chars.

i am dont know how i format the terminal output properly .. how do i do this?
Comment by dornhege on 2012-10-26:
gtkterm or here? Here, you can use  tags or for code indent by 4 spaces.
Comment by PerkinsJames on 2012-10-26:
I assume gtkterm is similar to minicom, but I always try minicom first.
Comment by dornhege on 2012-10-29:
To me it looks like everything is OK. Can you try just opening it using gtkterm or similar to see if you can open the port with the same parameters. If that works the only explanation I have is that the error msg might be misleading, i.e. the port could be opened, but commnucation fails (bad cable, protocol, etc.)
Comment by dornhege on 2012-10-29:
According to the error msg you added, there is a comm error. So, I would check at the other end, i.e. is there only one USB device (i.e. might it just try to connect to something else), is cables, hardware, etc. OK.
Comment by paetti88 on 2012-10-29:
im not sure how i have to use gtkterm to open it how i do this? ... no there are no other usb devices connectet.

at this problem http://answers.ros.org/question/11400/error-opening-turtlebot_dashboard/ they say they "recommend to check roomba stack" .. what does this mean?
Comment by dornhege on 2012-10-29:
The default turtlebot base is an irobot create. Roomba is the vacuum variant used in European turtlebot models. The roomba stack is probably this one: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roomba_500_series
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-29:
Are you using a roomba or an iCreate? In case of a roomba, I would not suggest to use the roomba stack but still the turtlebot driver. You''ll have to use a different robot launch file. See here
Comment by paetti88 on 2012-10-29:
jea i got an roomba and i tryed to use an other launch file but this doesent work ..
Comment by phil0stine on 2012-10-29:
What happens if you force chmod the permissions to /dev/ttyUSB0 , then launch? Did you use SYSFS or ATTRS in your udev rules?
Comment by paetti88 on 2012-10-30:
used ATTRS ... i did force permissons
Comment by Sentinal_Bias on 2013-05-29:
Hi i got messages returned via minicom from the create, however when i try the launchfile it doesn'twork...

A:

Did you reload udev rules after adding new ones? Are you sure rules were propertly added? There is still something wrong with permissions.
Post output of ls -la /dev/ttyUSB* and groups
First you need to be in dialout group, then make sure tty is owned by this group.
To add yourself to group:
gpasswd -a yourUserName dialout

Then relog / restart X server / reboot to make sure
udev rule:
ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001",ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",MODE="666",GROUP="dialout"
