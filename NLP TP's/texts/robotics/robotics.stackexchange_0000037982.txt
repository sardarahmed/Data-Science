Q:

How to use a gps to generate a map

I was wondering, if its possible to use the /odom(obtained from converting lat and longitude from gps) to generate a map.
Am using a Xsens mti_g device.
Using cyphy lab ros driver
Converted the lat and log using gps_common/utm_odometry_node
Regards,
AJ

Were you planning on using any other sensor, or just a map of all the places the GPS went?

thank you for your response Mr David.am also using a Hokuyo Laser Scanner

A:

I have no idea how accurate the map will be, but you should be able to use the odom readings to get the required transforms needed for mapping.
