Q:

Fails to build rosjava using Gradle

I have tried everything to get the package to compile using Gradle. I followed everything on the tutorials and installation. The only issue I have is when I try to compile it gives me this error
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':compile'.

Could not find group:ros.rosjava_core, module:rosjava, version:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
Required by:
GpsMap:GpsMap:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT

It seems to not find the jar files created by the build of rosjava_core and rosjava.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks
Ralph

A:

You either haven't added mavenLocal() to your repositories or you haven't executed the install task for rosjava_core.
