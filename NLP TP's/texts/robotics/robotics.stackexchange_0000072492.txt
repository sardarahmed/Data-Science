A:

I am working on odroid xu4, with sr300 intel camera!
I could use F200 before. But there is no more F200. SR300 is only available now. I am using now SR300 on ODROID XU4 using modified version of librealsene for ARM processor: librealsense , and modified ros package for SR300: realsense. I also patched the linux kernel 14.04 for using  V4L2 backend. The only problem that I have now I should run the node twice to work correctly.

I am planning to buy SR300 for Odroid XU4. Is it advisable or should I buy F200?
Are you using librealsense ?
