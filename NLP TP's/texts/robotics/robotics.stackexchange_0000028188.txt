Q:

Error [Plugin.hh:180] libvelodyne_plugin.so: No such file or directory Gazebo 8.1.1

I am following this tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=guided_i5&cat=#Step5:Buildandtest
When I run Gazebo:
gazebo --verbose ../velodyne.world

This error appears:
[Err] [Plugin.hh:180] Failed to load plugin libvelodyne_plugin.so: libvelodyne_plugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

How can I fix this?

A:

What is happening is that Gazebo can't find libvelodyne_plugin.so, this look for libraries in the directories indicate by LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviromental variable, so you need to indicate where to find it changing  it.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:~/velodyne_plugin/build
