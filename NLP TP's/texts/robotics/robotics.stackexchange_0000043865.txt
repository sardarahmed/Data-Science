Q:

Issues about Installing ROS on Mountain Lion

Hi, I'm trying to install ROS on Mac OSX 10.8.1, following electric Homebrew Installation. And after fixing(hopefully) the boost lib problem, new one comes:
[ rosmake ] Generating Install Script using rosdep then executing. This may take a minute, you will be prompted for permissions. . .
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: unrecognized version: 10.8.1
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/bin/rosinstall", line 16, in 
sys.exit(not rosinstall_main(sys.argv))
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/rosinstall/rosinstall_cli.py", line 228, in rosinstall_main
options.catkinpp)
File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/rosinstall/rosinstall_cmd.py", line 100, in cmd_generate_ros_files
subprocess.check_call("source %s && rosmake ros%s --rosdep-install%s" % (os.path.join(path, 'setup.sh'), ros_comm_insert, rosdep_yes_insert), shell=True, executable='/bin/bash')
File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 511, in check_call
raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'source /Users/Klinux/ros/setup.sh && rosmake ros ros_comm --rosdep-install' returned non-zero exit status 1
I searched on google but didn't get any results, so could anybody help me out of this?
Thanks a lot...

A:

I ran into a similar issue installing Fuerte.  Adding a version number for Mountain Lion to rospkg/os_detect.py:220 fixed the issue for me.
_osx_codename_map = {4: 'tiger',
5: 'leopard',
6: 'snow',
7: 'lion',
8: 'mountain lion'}

I'm not sure where that map is used in the rest of ROS so someone with more knowledge of the system than me might could comment on whether a space is acceptable in the os name.

thanks for your answer, actually after that I pass the making, strange though, but new problem comes out.... and I change to ubuntu.  so I cannot test if your suggestion does the trick or not. but thanks anyway.
