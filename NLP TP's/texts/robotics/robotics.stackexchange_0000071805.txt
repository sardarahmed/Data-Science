Q:

RGBDSLAM make problem: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrgbdslam

I managed to get rgbdslamv2  to work on ros but wasn't satisfied with the result I was getting so I decided to use icp in the
compilation process by setting the following variables :
set(USE_GICP_BIN        0)
set(USE_GICP_CODE       1)
set(USE_PCL_ICP       1)
This almost worked but I ran into a problem and had to reset the build path by doing
SET(gicp_build_path ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/felixendres-rgbdslam_v2-f7efd5b/external/gicp/ann_1.1.2)
instead of
SET(gicp_build_path ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/external/gicp/ann_1.1.2)
because for some reason this is how the folders are set up on my computer and everything seems to work fine until I run into the error:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrgbdslam
I am not sure what is going on and I'm kind of new to all this. Can someone help? Also,  all the editing was done only in the cmakelists.txt file
This is the output from my terminal:

A:

Unfortunately GICP is not supported anymore in rgbdslam_v2, so this won't be the only problem you need to fix. GICP inclusion is a remnant of a former colleagues work and would probably need quite some work to be made functional again.
You might try only USE_PCL_ICP, but I'd guess it might also be buggy.
Anyway, in my experiments, (G)ICP resulted in deviations more often than in improvements (which ought to be scenario-specific though).

Thanks Felix! One more question. I got rgbdslam to  work for my application  by recording the files listed here: link text apart from /tf.
Is /tf for the case where the camera position changes wrt the robot position over time?

Yes, that was the intention. I haven't tested this in a long time though.
