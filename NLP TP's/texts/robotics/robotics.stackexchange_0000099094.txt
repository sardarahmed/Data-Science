Q:

Would ROS developers prefer a Java or Python application on the command line?

I am writing code for a command-line application for testing ROS
packages automatically. My current plan is to code it in Java (due to
its potential, future deployment on the web).
I doubt if ROS developers mind installing a Java Virtual Machine to
run a third-party Java tool (if it works well)? Ease-of-use will be my
priority in making the decision. The application could also be written
in Python, but I vaguely feel it would be somewhat harder to maintain
due to my limited knowledge to Python ecosystem. Yet, if the ROS
community prefers a tool in Python, I can go that way too.
Any input about Python vs Java in the scope of this question will be
appreciated.

A:

I'm only one voice here, but my preference would be Python.
Python is already installed on most platforms ROS 2 developers will be using, as many parts of ROS 2 are written in Python.

I doubt if ROS developers mind installing a Java Virtual Machine to run a third-party Java tool (if it works well)?

installing a JVM is indeed not too much overhead, but it is more work, so with all else equal, Python would probably still be preferable.

My current plan is to code it in Java (due to its potential, future deployment on the web).

With things like FastAPI, writing a web-enabled version of whatever you create should not be too difficult I believe.
