Q:

hector_quadrotor-gazebo1.9 doesn't respond to command velocity

Hi Everyone,
I installed the hector_quadrotor from source (hydro and 1.9 gazebo) and launched the file “quadrotor_empty_world.launch”. Everything seems to be ok, empty_world with one quadrotor,   until I provided to the quadrotor a velocity command using “rostopic pub” and the quadrotor doesn’t move at all.
I verified via “rqt_graph” that gazebo is connected to the right topic (/cmd_vel) and also verified  if the data is published on the topic. Everything seems to be normal and I don’t know what else I can check. Any idea about this problem?
Thank you for any help with this issue

A:

Hi for me this command works:
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[0, 0, 1]' '[0, 0, 0]'
The problem might be that your quadcopter is not flying.
If the quadcopter is on the ground it needs a Twist with positive linear.z value.
The program will print Engaging motors!
As soon as you land on the ground the programm will print Shutting down motors! Which will mean you have to start it again.
Let me no if this does not solve your problem...

Hi evilBiber, thanks a lot for your tip. it worked and quadrotor took off. But I observed after awhile the quadrotor get frozen (motionless) on the space. I checked the quadrotor' pose via "rostopic echo /ground_truth/state" and the pose values are the same after reaching certain altitude (~952m). Also, I provided 0 command velocity (rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msg/Twist '[0, 0, 0,]' '[0, 0, 0]') to the quad to land on the ground but the quad stayed motionless. Do you know how to land the quad on the ground?. Thanks a lot again

you have to use negative z values for going down.
