Q:

How can we control only the Right and Left arm of the nao robot

I have succesfuly installed the nao package and I am able to publish the nao_sensors info. I want to now publish data to control only the arms of the nao robot and see the simulation of it in choregraphe. Is this possible with nao stack ??

A:

There is now a general joint angle / joint trajectory control in the trunk of the nao stack (check nao_controller.py in nao_ctrl). It allows to control any joint or chain on the Nao with ROS messages or an actionlib server.
