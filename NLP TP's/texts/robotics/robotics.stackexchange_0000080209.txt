Q:

What is the algorithm used in base_local_planner

I am using base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS as base local planner and navfn/NavfnROS as global planner for navigation.
I didn't find the algorithm of these planners anywhere.
In the tutorial of base local planner base local planner the information given is not much to understand how the path is planned.
Can anybody please explain how these planners plan path? What is the algorithm they use?
