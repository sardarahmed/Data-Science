Q:

IDE for Baxter with ROS development

Hi,
I am a beginner in ROS. I am trying to control Baxter Robot using ROS in C++ language. I am following the ROS and Baxter Tutorials to learn it. Till now, I am using gedit editor for code writing. Gedit it irritating in the sense, that I need to switch to terminal for compiling using Catkin_Make and switch back to Gedit incase of any error. Apart from that auto-suggestion and debugging are two big challenges, which are not available in Gedit v3.
I am looking for an IED, which has at least following support-

Suitable for ROS + Baxter C++ code development
Auto suggestion while writing the code (like Netbeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio etc.)
Compile and Run Project (So that, there is no need to run Catkin_Make from terminal)
Line by line debugging support (Functionality to insert breakpoint)
Go to definition/Find all references (to see the definitions, header files etc)

Please note that I am using ROS Indigo in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 Bit OS.

Hi, I'm also a beginner in ROS and Baxter. I'm thinking use c++ to program my Baxter robot but I only can found the python example in Baxter wiki. So may I know where can find those tutorial or like an example to use C++ to program Baxter robot? Thank you!

A:

There is not an IDE specific to Baxter or ROS, but a few can be made compatible, such as Eclipse and CodeBlocks. Please see the ROS Wiki page on IDEs for more details: http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs

Thank you very much for providing the reference of IDE page. Well, I prefer IDE for fast and easy code development. What do you suggest to use? IDE or Gedit?

My personal preference is a combination of the Terminator Ubuntu app for compiling and launching ROS nodes, and Github's Atom IDE for writing code.
