Q:

pi_face_tracker in rosjava

I'm now trying to do item selection in rosjava. But I have problem on it. For the node pi_face_tracker, we need to get image form it, the msg type is image, but what we have form the camera is compressedimage. When we use the image_transfer node to transfer the image, what class in rosjava can i use? Can anyone help me?

A:

There is no implementation of image_transport of rosjava. However, depending on your use-case it may not be necessary. See the android_tutorial_image_transport for an example of how to work with nodes that expect to be communicating via image_transport.
