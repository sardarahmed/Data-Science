Q:

How to create a world of stage?

I want to create a world of stage with online slam.
I found that even in move_base_gmapping_5cm.launch it uses the static world which made before not dynamic during slam process.
How to create a world of my room during slam and used by rviz?
Thank you~

A:

move_base_gmapping_5cm.launch does generate a map dynamically while being run. Only Stage (the simulator) has access to a priori map data.
There isn't a way to feed a dynamically generated map into Stage online.  If you think about it, this makes sense: the simulator needs to know what's in the world to simulate the robot's sensor data.
If you want to generate a SLAM map of your own environment, take a look at the slam_gmapping tutorials.  You could then use that map in a Stage .world file to simulate a robot in your environment.
