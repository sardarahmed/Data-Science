Q:

CANopen Interface

hi there!!
I'm new on ROS and I'm trying to move a motor that have a CANopen (Control Area Network) interface. Looking into the stack list I'd find the cob_canopen_motor. Well, the problem is that I don't know how to make it work. There is not a "cob_canopen_motor_node" to run and there isn't any documentation.
I'm trying hard! :D
well, thanks a lot!!

A:

There is not a "cob_canopen_motor_node" to run

That is correct. If you look at the CMakeLists.txt, you can see that it only compiles a shared library. Which means that this library will be used somewhere.

and there isn't any documentation

Actually, there is some documentation about cob_canopen_motor on its ros wiki page. If you click on "Used By", you can see that e.g. cob_base_drive_chain uses this package, so I would suggest to look there on how to use it.

Ow yes you are right about the documentation, but it talks about the cob plataform (off course it's a cob driver! hehe). The question is: "How can I use only the specific drive that commands the CAN layer?" tks again
