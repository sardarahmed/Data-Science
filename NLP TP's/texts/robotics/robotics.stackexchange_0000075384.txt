Q:

How to print all Info in InteractiveMarkerFeedback

I am following the Simple Interactive Marker tutorial and I try to visualize all the information I can get from the pointer. But catkin_make complains the function  is not existent, but the class template says otherwise. Headers and package.xml and cmakelist should be ok.
How to go from here:
 void processMarkerFeedback(const
                           visualization_msgs::InteractiveMarkerFeedbackConstPtr
                           & feedbackPtr)
{
  unsigned char buff[1000];
  feedbackPtr->serialize(buff);// fail
  printf("%s\n", buff);

catkin_make says

error: ‘const struct visualization_msgs::InteractiveMarkerFeedback_std::allocator<void >’ has no member named ‘serialize’

A:

I use kinetic, and it looks like they dissolved the header file InteractiveMarkerFeedback. 
Cannot locate it anymore. Basically it was only about (de-) serialization.
Probably to reduce src files, the new interactive marker definition is here.
