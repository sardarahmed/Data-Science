施佳伟？    程序阻塞了，用select函数可以解决。

您好！ 没想到你也是中国人啊 呵呵。 我叫贾士伟。 根据你的指点，没找到select函数啊，你是在哪找的呢？ 我用的是boost 里的udp

Hi,nice to meet you .Boost library may not contain the selectfunction,you can use async_read() to work in asynchronous way for data reading .Here is boost::ASIO的异步方式 .And if you donnot use the boost class , you can directly use socket for udp

A:

The process has been blocked，so you cannot use Ctrl c to kill the node. However, it is not recommended to allow the program to work in a blocked state.You can use function  selectwhen you use  readto get some data in UDP or  serial port process.
