Q:

GZWeb not showing extra robot model

Hello,
I've installed gzweb, and configured the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH variable to include my custom models prior to running the deploy script.
I'm running a script from the PX4 folks to produce a quadcopter running inside a gazebo simulation. It shows up just fine in gzclient, but I can't get the graphic for the model to show in GZWeb. The object is present - I can select it in the object selector, it's just like it has no graphics/textures.
It DOES show up in my gzweb http/assets folder. Ideas? It's a basic iris quadcopter model...

A:

chapulina's comment was in the right direction, but not quite there. The files were missing, even though I had included them in the deploy. I copied them into the assets folder and it fixed it.
