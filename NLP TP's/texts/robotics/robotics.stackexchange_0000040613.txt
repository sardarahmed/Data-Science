Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rosdoc fails

Hi everyone,
I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte. I installed ROS desktop full and documentation using apt-get.
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full ros-fuerte-documentation

When I try to use rosdoc, I get the following error:
$ rosrun rosdoc rosdoc turtlesim
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/documentation/rosdoc/src/rosdoc/rdcore.py:43: UserWarning: roslib.rospack is deprecated, please use rospkg
  import roslib.rospack
initializing rosdoc context:
    package filters: ['turtlesim']
    path filters: []
+package[turtlesim]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/documentation/rosdoc/src/rosdoc/__init__.py", line 134, in main
    artifacts = generate_docs(ctx)
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/documentation/rosdoc/src/rosdoc/__init__.py", line 83, in generate_docs
    import doxygenator
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/documentation/rosdoc/src/rosdoc/doxygenator.py", line 334, in <module>
    header_template = load_tmpl(header_template_name())
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/documentation/rosdoc/src/rosdoc/doxygenator.py", line 199, in header_template_name
    major, minor, patch = doxygen_version.split('.')
ValueError: too many values to unpack

My Doxygen version is 1.7.6.1
Thanks!!

A:

I am seeing this, too, with Fuerte on Precise.
I am fairly certain it works better with Fuerte on Oneiric.
We should open a defect ticket on the documentation stack.
