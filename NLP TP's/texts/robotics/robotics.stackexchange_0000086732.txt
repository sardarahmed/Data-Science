Q:

Fiducial based robot relocalization for AMCL

I want to use a transform from Fiducial marker to re-localize my odometry on AMCL .
https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials , i intend to use this .

The idea is to have a fixed fiducial on the map , demarcating the home location
Once the fiducial is detected , the robots current position is relocalized based on the tf from the tracker .

What is your question?

Once the robot sees a AR_tracker , it should relocalize .
Its kind of like a 'homing' mechanism.
When AMCL starts , it starts at some random coordinate , post which the odometry estimation is often wrong . I want to put in a correction mechanism .

Ok, but what is your question? You're giving statements, but no question.

@jarvisschultz ,
Thanks solved the problem . I didnt see the inirialpose before .

A:

One option would be to add use the initialpose topic to completely re-initialize your particle filter whenever you see a known fiducial.
Perhaps a better choice would be to include fiducial measurements into robot_localization as a measurement source. Then the filtered estimate from robot_localization will produce a much more accurate tf tree that amcl can use.
