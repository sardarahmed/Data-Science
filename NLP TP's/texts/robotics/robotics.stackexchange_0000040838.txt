Q:

What is the purpose of ROS_WORKSPACE

I recently installed Fuerte and now when I run roscd without arguments it complains that ROS_WORKSPACE is not set. I haven't been able to find much information about this new environment variable. So far, I can only see that roscd uses it.
Is this just used by roscd or are there other tools that use it? And is it something that I need to set?

A:

ROS_WORKSPACE is set by the setup.sh created by rosinstall or rosws. it points to the path in which the setup.sh and the .rosinstall are located.
It is used by rosinstall / rosws, and also by roscd. No other tool uses it as far as I know.
If roscd without arguments complains that it is missing, then don't call roscd without arguments.
In electric and earlier, roscd without arguments would go to ROS_ROOT. However, starting with fuerte (and catkin), ROS_ROOT becomes less important (and should eventually go away), so we had the choice of making roscd without arguments do nothing, or do something useful sometimes.
If that were too confusing we could change roscd to not complain if no ROS_WORKSPACE is set and do nothing instead.
