Q:

ROS Microcontroller cpp support?

In this momment I only know a cpp API for Arduino/AVR. Do you know other existing cases?
It is planned to support more microcontrollers?

A:

rosserial is not tied explicitly to Arduino/AVR, but is instead a serial protocol that could be used with any embedded-scale device.
I believe that it was intended to be easily portable to embedded devices with a C++ compiler.
Something else that may be of interest to you is rosserial_embeddedlinux, which uses the same rosserial protocol to communicate with embedded linux devices.  The author writes:

This package contains
embedded-linux-specific extensions
required to run rosserial on a small
embedded linux system such as the
VEXPro controller, Chumby alarm clock,
WRT54GL router, Raspberry Pi, or many
similar devices.

If you are interested in contributing to the longer-term embedded device goals of the ROS community, I encourage you to check out the ROS Embedded SIG.
