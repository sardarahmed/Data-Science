Q:

rviz run saved messages

Hello,
I'm running a program that sends visualization messages, like the ones in the basic shape tutorial.
While running the program I saved the messages with  rostopic echo /visualization_marker > myfile.txt.
I'm looking for a way to display thoose messages in rviz, is there such a way?
I tried rostopic pub /visualization_marker visualization_msgs::MarkerArray  -f myfile.txt, but i get ERROR: invalid topic type: visualization_msgs::MarkerArray. While rviz displays this is the topic type.
Kind regards
