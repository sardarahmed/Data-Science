Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Optris package

Hello,
I would like to optris_drivers from ros.
I get this page but I don't know how to install it:
http://wiki.ros.org/optris_drivers
Can I have some help?
Best regard.

A:

I managed to get the optris_drivers package working on Ubuntu 14.04 using ROS Indigo, but I had to make some changes to the repository. I have submitted a pull request, but the changes haven't been integrated into the trunk. In the meantime, my forked version can be found here.
To install, change to your catkin source directory, probably with the following command if you installed ROS with default settings:
roscd
cd ../src/

Then clone the repo with:
git clone https://github.com/steevo87/optris_drivers.git

You should then be able to build it using the following command:
catkin_make optris_drivers

Did you test hydro branch of optris_drivers in ROS indigo? since hydro and indigo have very similar build infrastructures i think it would be compiled in ROS indigo either.

I dowload the file with git but I get these errors: sudo /opt/ros/indigo/bin/catkin_make optris_drivers Traceback (most recent call last): File "/opt/ros/indigo/bin/catkin_make", line 13, in  from catkin.init_workspace import init_workspace
I don't really understand the error.

This appears to be a generic ROS error, and possibly nothing to do with the optris_drivers package. It seems similar to this one. Was there any additional information for that error?

I suggest you go through the ROS Tutorials for how to build ROS packages.
