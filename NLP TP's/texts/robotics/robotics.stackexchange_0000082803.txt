Q:

Stop the whole ros through C++ code

Hi all,
Does anyone know is there c++ API that can help to shut down the whole ros instead of a node? What I want to do is I plan to use shell script for automating the simualtion in ros. I use roslaunch command for spawning the environment and drones. And run another c++ file (a node) for controller. However, I do not know how to stop ros when the controling algorithm is finished. If I use ros::shutdown(), I can only shutdown the controller node but the graphic interface is still here. So, does anyone here know any way to shut down the whole ros through c++ code?
Thanks

A:

If you run everything from a single launch file, you can add the required="true" attribute to your controller node, which will cause roslaunch to stop all of the other nodes when your controller node exits.
See http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node for a more detailed description of all of the attributes to the <node> tag and what they do.
