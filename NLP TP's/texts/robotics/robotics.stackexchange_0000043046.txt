Q:

How does rosjava relate to ROS?

I have several years experience with Java, but I am brand new to ROS.  For my academic program, I will be working with Clearpath robotics products such as the Husky and Kingfisher.  This week, I discovered rosjava.
I am wondering how rosjava turns into instructions for a robot running ROS.  Does the robot have a JVM that executes the Java bytecode?  Does rosjava compile the Java into ROS-executable code?  Or does rosjava create nodes external to the robot that can communicate to the ROS system?
Thank you for reading.

A:

rosjava provides Java classes for creating ROS Nodes in java and communicating with any ROS node, as well as a java implementation of a ROS master.
To run java or rosjava on a robot, you only need a standard JVM on the robot.
You can run rosjava nodes anywhere, on the robot or remotely, and they do not need the java rosmaster to run.
