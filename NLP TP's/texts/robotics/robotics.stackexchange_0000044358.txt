Q:

Unable to detect iCreate

Hi all, I am in the process of setting up my newly-built Turtlebot and am having an issue with ROS detecting my Turtlebot that is connected to my computer via a USB to Serial adapter. Any help would be MUCH appreciated. I have not confirmed that the USB to Serial adapter works in any application, but its presence in "lsusb" assures me it is running.
I am using the same machine as both my Workstation AND Turtlebot laptop (for now): Thinkpad T410 Running Ubuntu 12.04 Precise, ros-fuerte installed.
For my network setup, I simply gave the same IP twice. I am now attempting to run this tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/TurtleBot%20Bringup) but I get grey buttons in the dashboard. My IP addresses are correct (Unless Turtlebot is absolutely incompatible without two separate machines), so I performed some of the tests mentioned in the Networking tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot/Network%20Setup).
The Turtlebot is charged, every cable (Kinect, iCreate via USB-Serial adapter) is plugged into my box, but I still receive the following output:
    ~$ lsusb

And also can you please post the exact lines you added to your ~/.bashrc file to mention the IPs ?
Comment by DGonz on 2012-09-23:
Yes, the lines are : #source /etc/environment
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://myIP:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=myIP
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://myIP:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=myIP

Ca you see the ports in /dev using ls -l?  Do you have permissions to access the port?

A:

Try plugging the Create cable to a different port on your laptop other than the one it is plugged into now. I had the same problem, I inserted it into another port and it worked for me. Sometimes problems come with the laptop ports as well.
