Q:

vision_opencv installation error on beagleboard

Hey
I was trying to install vision_opencv from here:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vision_opencv/

on my BeagleBoard xM running Oneiric.
Each time i perform
rosdep install vision_opencv

I get an error saying: unable to find ros-fuerte-opencv2.
I checked the Makefile and it says to look for ros-fuerte-opencv2 in the apt-repository, but since we don't really have a ros repository for BeagleBoard and the installation has to be done from source, i dont really know how to install this package.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

A:

The source installation is the only way to install something on an ARM Platform but after a while is pretty straightforward:
first checkout the source code
$ svn checkout https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vision_opencv/trunk

then create a build dir and go into it
$ mkdir build && cd build

then make it with cmake
$ cmake ..

then make and install
$ make
$ sudo make install

hope I could help.
