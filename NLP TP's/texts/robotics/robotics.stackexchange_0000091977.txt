Q:

Why doesn't ros2 pkg list show the packages that I built?

I am trying to build 2 new nodes, based on the minimal_publisher and minimal_subscriber examples provided by the ros2_ws overlay workspace. I have copied and pasted my code from the examples, with the intention to change them in the near future.
I then changed the names of the source files, and the name of the package, among other names. To ensure a successful build, I made several corresponding changes to the CMakeLists.txt and package.xml of each package as well.
Both packages built successfully. However, the only way I can run them is if I locate the binary files in the install directory of the ros2_ws workspace and run them from there.
If I run ros2 pkg list or ros2 pkg executables, none of my packages show up there. Predictably, when I run ros2 run publisht tester_publisht (publisht is the name of my pkg and tester_publisht is the name of the executable) , it just shows Package 'publisht' not found.
Why is it that ros2 pkg cannot find my package?
My publisht package in the install directory of ros2_ws:
publisht

        └── package.zsh

My tester directory in ros2_ws/src, which contains the source code for the 2 nodes I intend to make, publisht and subscribet:
tester 
├── publisht
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── package.xml
│   ├── publisht.cpp
│   └── README.md
├── README.md
└── subscribet
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── package.xml
    ├── README.md
    └── subscribet.cpp

My CMakeLists.txt for publisht:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5) 
project(publisht)

# Default to C++14
if(NOT CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
endif()

if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX OR CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Clang")
  add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
endif()

find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(std_msgs REQUIRED)

add_executable(tester_publisht publisht.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(tester_publisht rclcpp std_msgs)

install(TARGETS
  tester_publisht
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)

ament_package()

And my package.xml for publisht:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://download.ros.org/schema/package_format2.xsd" schematypens="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"?>

Yes, it worked. My bad; I thought that since I sourced the setup.bash in my .bashrc I didn't need to source it again. Apparently I need to source it again after I built publisht.
Thank you very much.

A:

Have you sourced the install/setup.bash file in the workspace where you built publish?
