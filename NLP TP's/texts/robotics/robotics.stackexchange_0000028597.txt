Q:

Read sensor data with ROS

I've just started to learn ROS and Gazebo and now, finally, I can connect ROS with Gazebo (I control a robot in Gazebo with keyboard using turtlesim turtle_teleop_key.
Now I want to add some sensors to my robot and read the data from ROS. How can I do it? Do I need to code a Gazebo plugin?

To extract data from Gazebo, you have three options:

Use a pre-existing Gazebo Plugin/Sensor that publishes the data to ROS
Use a pre-existing Gazebo Plugin or Sensor that publishes the data to the Gazebo Transport Layer. You'll have to access this data (e.g. from a ROS Node) via the Gazebo Transport Library.
Write your own custom Gazebo Plugin that publishes sensor data using either of the above methods.
