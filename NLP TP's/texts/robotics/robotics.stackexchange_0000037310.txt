Q:

roslaunch if condition

How can say: run this node if argX==y
The following does not work, and the documentation on this is lacking.
<node pkg="xxx" type="yyy" name="yyy" if="$(arg argX)==y" />

A:

You can do this now in ROS Kinetic using eval:
<arg name="arg_name" default="desired_value"/>

<node pkg="node_pkg" type="node_type" name="node_name" 
      if="$(eval arg('arg_name') == 'desired_value')"/>

The documentation has been updated: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML
