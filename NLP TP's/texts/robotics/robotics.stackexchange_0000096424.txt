Q:

Cannot locate node of type [ekf_localization_node] in package [robot_localization]

Hello, I'm new in ROS.
When I tried to run robot_localization package by this command:  roslaunch robot_localization ekf_template.launch
I have met this issue below:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [robot_localization/ekf_localization_node]:
Cannot locate node of type
[ekf_localization_node] in package
[robot_localization]. Make sure file
exists in package path and permission
is set to executable (chmod +x)

I had run these commands before that:

source devel/setup.bash

and

source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

So can I fix it? Many thanks.
[UPDATE] When I used the command:

rosrun robot_localization
ekf_localization_node

I got:

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable
named ekf_localization_node below
/home/swarm-robotics/catkin_ws/src/robot_localization

A:

As per info in your question, you first ran
source devel/setup.bash

to source your workspace and then:
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

Which is the cause it's not working.
First run
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

followed by sourcing your workspace and it should work if everything else is fine.
Also, make sure you ran catkin_make in the workspace you have the package in.

Many thanks,
In my case, if I ran 2 commands follow your guide, it not working but it's ok when I run only source devel/setup.bash
When I ran catkin_make --pkg robot_localization again, it's working correctly. I think when I used catkin_make command previously, I make a few mistakes but I skipped it.
