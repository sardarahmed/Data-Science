Q:

ROS Hydro on beaglebone black rev c

About six months ago I was able to use Ubuntu 12.04 and sudo-apt-get to install ros-hydro-navigation without any dependency errors. Trying to  do this a second BBB has not been as easy ros-base  installed easily, but navigation now has   many dependency problems.  I suspect these are related to libboost version problems (my version is 1.46), but I am not sure:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-navigation : Depends: ros-hydro-amcl but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-base-local-planner but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-carrot-planner but it is not going tobe installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-clear-costmap-recovery but it is not  going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-costmap-2d but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-dwa-local-planner but it is not going  to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-fake-localization but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-map-server but it is not going to be  installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-move-base but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-move-slow-and-clear but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-nav-core but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-navfn but it is not going to be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-robot-pose-ekf but it is not going to  be installed
                    Depends: ros-hydro-rotate-recovery but it is not going to be installed

Upgrading libboost from 1.46 to 1.48 did not work, in fact it removed all of the ros packages.

A:

sudo aptitude install ros-hydro-navigation
Seemed to work -  issue was with c libraries.  So it might be when I installed build-essentials, it was with the wrong flavor.
Darn, It took me two days to figure out this one. It is helps to be stubborn.
