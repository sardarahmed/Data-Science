Q:

„[rospack] Error: no such package beginner_tutorials“

Hi, I'm absolutely new to ROS (and quite new to LINUX).
I installed ROS JADE on Ubuntu 14.04 and did the first three tutorials. In the Tutorial: „Creating a ROS Package“ I'm encountering an error. The command:
rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials 

gives:
[rospack] Error: no such package beginner_tutorials

My catkin structure is:
hpe@hpe-P5Q-PRO:~/catkin_ws$ ls
beginner_tutorials  build  devel  src

I tried to add the workspace with:
 $ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

and
hpe@hpe-P5Q-PRO:~/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash

But with same result.
Any idea what is wrong with my setup?

For future questions: if you use the 101010 button on the formatting toolbar (Preformatted text) it will make console copy/pastes much easier to read. Thanks.

A:

My catkin structure is:

hpe@hpe-P5Q-PRO:~/catkin_ws$ ls

beginner_tutorials  build  devel  src 

Packages (such as beginner_tutorials) should be placed inside the src directory. By default, that is the only place catkin will look for them, and if you build your workspace as it is right now, no packages should be found (catkin_make probably finished rather quickly, and without compiling any files).
Helpful diagram (from here):

This layout is also suggested / recommended in the Creating a ROS Package tutorial, in the Packages in a catkin Workspace section. Perhaps you've missed the first sentence under Creating a catkin Package:

First change to the source space directory of the catkin workspace you created in the Creating a Workspace for catkin tutorial [..]

See if after moving the beginner_tutorials dir, rebuilding your workspace and re-sourcing devel/setup.bash the rospack find .. command succeeds.

Good answer, really hits the spot.I was going to answer it  but you did such a good job I had to say so. I think this ticket can be closed.
