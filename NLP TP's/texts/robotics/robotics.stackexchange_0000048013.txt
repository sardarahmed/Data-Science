Q:

robot's urdf and robot pose ekf

Hi all,
I have a problem. I wrote an urdf file for my robot tried it on RVIZ an it worked well.
now I want to combine it with robot_pose_ekf package after I wrote an appropriate launch file I have got a problem because my main transform is the first link of the robot and not the odom_combined transform. when I am trying to change that there is a mess in connections between the links and odom_combined transforms, or even there is no connection at all.
what could be the problem?
please help...

A:

I think the problem comes from the fact that robot_pose_ekf creates a transform between your main transform and /odom_combined. But since your main transform has already a parent (as far as I understand) and transforms cannot have multiple parents, it creates a mess.
It would surely help to see the tf tree to find out the problem.
