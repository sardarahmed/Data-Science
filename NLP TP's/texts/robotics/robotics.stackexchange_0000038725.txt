Q:

How can I create a skydome in Gazebo?

I am trying to create a Gazebo world that contains an HDR (High Dynamic Range) skydome and a texture-mapped ground plane. The ground plane was easy, but I haven't discovered how to create the skydome. In Electric, empty.world in gazebo_worlds contains this:
<rendering:ogre>
<ambient>0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5</ambient>
<sky>
  <material>Gazebo/CloudySky</material>
</sky>
<grid>false</grid>
<maxUpdateRate>10.</maxUpdateRate>
<shadowTechnique>none</shadowTechnique>
<shadows>false</shadows>

</rendering:ogre>
I know how to replace Gazebo/CloudySky with a custom material that has a different texture map, but I don't know what texture map format <sky> expects. Examples are fish-eye, polar, vertical face map, etc. I haven't found any documentation describing how Gazebo skies work. Does anyone know of any? Can anyone point me to example world files that use skydomes? Lastly, does Gazebo support 16-bit float (i.e. half) OpenEXR files?

A:

I looked at the gazebo-1.0.0-RC2 source code, and found that the <sky> element creates an OGRE SkyDome with curvature 10, tiling 8, distance 4000, and an orientation along the positive z axis. Since the tiling value cannot be specified in the world file, it is impossible to use a lat-long environment map, which would require a tiling value of 1. A work-around is to refrain from specifying a sky, instead surrounding the scene with a giant cube mesh that is mapped with the appropriate textures.
The version of Gazebo in Electric supports using 16-bit OpenEXR files as texture maps.
