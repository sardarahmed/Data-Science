Q:

How to create simple ROS Android application

Hi - my goal is to build a very simple Android app that will run on my phone (HTC ONE M8) and will:

Connect to a remote ROS master on the same network
Publish Int16 messages to two separate topics

Ideally, I'd like to just create a new project in Android Studio and add dependencies to ros android libs from some external maven repository, and then use things like RosActivity and NodeMain in my project. I'd rather not have to build any ros-android or rosjava libs from source myself. Really want to just keep things as simple as possible here.
Is it possible to do this? I can't find any simple instructions on how to do the above anywhere on wiki.ros.org, and have failed miserably trying to follow the various android setup/build instructions that are on wiki.ros.org.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Zach

A:

I think this is what you're looking for. There is some tutorial on them to understand.
Especially here it talks about pairing with Android. I did not work on that so I can't really tell how cool it is, not how easy or complicated it is though. But I've download the application to try once (Robocon on google play) and it seems quite intuitive.

The links you provided eventually led me to this Android Studio Development Environment tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/android/Tutorials/hydro/Installation%20-%20Android%20Studio%20Development%20Environment which I must have somehow overlooked before. That was exactly the setup I was looking for. Thanks!
