Q:

how to get args from node object of rosjava Node class?

Hey,
While running rosjava node we receive "node" object in onStart(Node node) function. Can we extract command line args from this "node" object. I tried to get NodeConfiguration and ParameterTree but did not work. Any idea?
regards

A:

Command line arguments are not yet supported. I suggest using the parameter server. Also, feel free to file a feature request.
