Q:

Point cloud SLAM

Hello
I have a problem with the lokalization of my platform when running through corridors or between two tides walls. I tried to use the Hector Mapping but when for example driving the platform up/down a ramp corridor it failed. So, the Hector Mapping see like the platform is not moving(going forward) because has a problem with the scan matching. In my case amcl is not an option because I wont to use the platform without encoders, only IMU, Kinect and laser. So I thought about SLAM with  point clouds. But I do not know if something exist in the ROS world.ANY help??
Thanks

A:

U can look at RGBD slam. It uses an RGBD sensor like kinect or stereo camera. You can go to this link for details   http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam

But does it need encoders ?I wont to use it for a platform without encoders, so without wheel odometry. Is that possible?And is a good option to use in a very limited environments like tidy walls corridors??

It probably wont require odometery readings. Since I havent used the package myself, I am not sure.

And do u know if its works well in limited environment like corridors with tidy walls ?
