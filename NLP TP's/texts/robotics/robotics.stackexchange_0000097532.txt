Q:

is theconstructsim real or a scam

hi all.
i have been learning ros for a while now online, and i was looking for a nice good and comprehensive course. i am sorry if this question is not appropriate but has anyone heard about theconstructsim.com?
is this a reliable site? or is this just a scam. i tried to find reviews on the courses but found none.
TIA

Asking "are they real or not" about the Construct, which is mostly using simulation to support their educational activities made me chuckle.

That is a good point @gvdhoorn !!

A:

They have a lot of free content if you are interested, at least in youtube.
I used their service for a year and it really helped a lot since I was just starting ROS. You can save a lot of time, by reusing their setup configurations for a real robot, until you know what you are doing.

thank you for the answer. it just seemed wired that they have almost no reviews online.
i tried it out. sadly, it has no video instructions, just text so it was not what i was looking for. i was looking for udemy style courses just more comprehensive.

If you prefer Udemy courses, we also have an Udemy course based on videos and a set of rosjects that you can run for free on the cloud without having to install anything on your computer, so you have the ROS environment already setup online. Check it out here: https://www.udemy.com/course/ros-basics-1/
