Q:

Avoid going reverse

My Turtlebot3 (on the carpeted floor of my lab) doesn't do well going backwards. There must be a setting somewhere to avoid going backwards if possible? I assume this would be the planner not laying out a route which requires going in reverse. I suppose sometimes it is unavoidable, so this would be a "avoid reverse if possible". Is there something like that?

A:

Not very familiar with the Turtlebot3, but I imagine if you're using one of their demo navigation setups you'll need to change the parameters for the local planner in one of the param files here. The parameter name you're looking for will depend on which local planner is used, but it should be something like "min_vel_x".
