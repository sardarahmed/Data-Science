Q:

Rosout topic, non-string messages

As I read I understand that all topics messages are displayed in rosout topic. But as I see the messages that are different than a simple string aren't displayed, isn't it?
So what can I do if I want to show all the messages from all topics?. Is there a log file? or can I change the rosout configuration?. Perhaps the unique method is to subscribe to every topic?
Thank you.

A:

rosout does not display all topics!
It displays information send from programs via ROS_INFO/ROS_WARN, etc.
You can look at any message via: rostopic echo <topic>.
And yes, there are logging facilities. Look for rosrecord and rosbag.
