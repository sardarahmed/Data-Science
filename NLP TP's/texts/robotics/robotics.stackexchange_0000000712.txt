Q:

Quadruped Learning Simulator

I'm currently building a robot with four legs (quadruped), 3 DOF (Degrees of Freedom) and Its been suggested here that I use a simulator to do the learning on a computer and then upload the algorithms to the robot. I'm using an Arduino Uno for the robot and what software could I use to simulate the learning and then be able to upload to the Arduino board?

A:

Gazebo is a good tool for what you want to do. Since you're using a custom robot you will need to build a model for the simulator to use. They have managed to make doing so pretty easy but for a quadraped I can imagine it will take a bit of time.
Gazebo is also nice because it works well with ROS which means that if you build you could build a program to control your robot and send the commands to the simulated robot via the integration or to the real robot via rosserial. Just beware that if you have not used any of these tools then it will take some time to develop your solution.
