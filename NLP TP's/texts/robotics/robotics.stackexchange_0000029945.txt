Q:

Material-dependent transparency in Gazebo

Hi,
By request I'm reposting this question from the ros-users mailing list. Again, my apologies if this issue has been addressed elsewhere previously, but I was unable to find an answer after searching around for a while.
My problem is that whenever I spawn a gazebo object with certain basic material properties (e.g. Blue, Gold), it is transparent when viewed in front of the ground plane. If I adjust the camera to look at it horizontally, I can then see the top part of the object that projected onto the sky.
However, if I spawn the same object, but change its material to, e.g. RustySteel, it is completely visible. For example, if I spawn the table object using the table.launch script in gazebo_worlds, I can see the table top (LightWood) but not the legs (Red). There are no error messages in the console.
Does anyone know how to fix this problem? I'm sure there's a relatively straightforward solution, but it has alluded me so far :)
System info:
Ubuntu Maverick (2.6.35-25) 64bit running on Parallels VM on MBP i7
ROS C Turtle, all packages are up to date.
I was also able to reproduce this problem on a Dell Quad Core running 64bit Maverick.
Thanks in advance!

A:

Gazebo's sensor simulation which relies on Ogre libraries have been known to be problematic on VM's.  What types of (emulated) GPU and GPU driver are you using?
