Q:

How to create round shape models in Stage

Hi, I'm working with robot swarm simulation in Stage and I need some round shape models as obstacles.But after searching I only find out how to make polygon models by defining each vertex. 
Is there any method to make round shape models in Stage? Drawing a picture with round obstacles as a map may be feasible but that would be lack of extendability as my map scale may vary.

Well, I guess it's impossible. I tried to draw a picture. The corresponding round obstacle in stage is made of a vast number of rectangular obstacles of different sizes. So I think round obstacle is not supported in stage.
