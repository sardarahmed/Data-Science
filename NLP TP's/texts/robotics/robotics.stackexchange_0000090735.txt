Q:

What is installed when I install ros-melodic-desktop-full?

I followed this guide in order to install ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04. Specifically, I installed the "full version" by issuing the command sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full. What exactly is installed with this command? Is e.g. rospkg (or python-rospkg) and rosbag installed?

A:

@ChriMo's answer is ok, but the official definition of the contents of those meta-packages can be found in REP 150: ROS Melodic and Newer Metapackages.
