Q:

Where should I put generated Python srv

I looked for it in the tutorials and online but I didn't find anything helpful. After uncommenting the line srv_gen in CMakeFiles.txt and running rosmake, some files are generated including headers for C++ put in include folder and Python scripts which are put into the folder packagename/src/packagename. The generated Python module's name was _myServiceMessagesFile.py for myServiceMessagesFile.srv being my service's messages declaration file that I put in packagename/srv.
Then the tutorial says to use "import myServiceMessagesFile.srv" which doesn't work.
I solved this problem by taking the generated .py file from packagename/src/packagename folder and putting it in the same folder as my Python script (for example packagename/scripts) needing this messages, but I feel that this method is more a dirty fix than an elegant solution.
I work with ros groovy and rosbuild. Can somebody give me some hints on what to do?

A:

You shouldn't have to move the generated service files.
Are you following the rosbuild version of the python service and client tutorial?
Your import should be:
from mypackage.srv import *

yes and somehow it doesn't find it.
ImportError: No module named GetMeasures.srv

The correct form for this import is from [package].srv import [service].

Thanks. I somehow got confused in the tutorial ending up using myServiceMessagesFile.srv instead of  package.srv
