This isn't a question about ROS, and there isn't enough information here to help you.

A:

You can use the normal include_directories/target_link_libraries cmake macros for this:
include_directories(${ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
orocos_component(foo foo.cpp)
target_link_libraries(foo ${ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES_TO_LINK_WITH})

Did you use find_package(curl) to find curl?
