Q:

ROS Master-Client Communication

I just installed winros (Msvc build environment) on my Windows 7 (x64) machine and I am trying to send a message from my ROS master on my Ubuntu machine to winros (client). I can ping both ways.
However, when I try to set master IP and ROS IP on Windows using:
export ROS_MASTER_URI="hxxp://XXX.XXX.X.XXX:11311/ 
export ROS_IP=XXX.XXX.X.XX 
It gives me an error saying "export is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file".
Any ideas on what the source of this error could be?
It gave me a similar error when I tried to use 'wget' command. I resolved that by adding Wget .exe file location to the PATH.

Thanks for the answer.  I used SET instead of EXPORT and it worked. However, they use EXPORT in their win_ros troubleshooting guide! This is the link: http://www.ros.org/wiki/win_ros/Resolving%20One%20Way%20Broadcasting%20Issues

likely due to mingw use

A:

Because export is a Linux command, Windows don't know what expot means.
Take a look at this question.
