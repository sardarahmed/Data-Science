Q:

Is there a V4L camera driver for Kinetic?

Hi, I see several usb camera drivers (usb_cam, uvc_camera) that I assume will work w/ a V4L driver, but nothing that supports Kinetic. Am I missing something? Any suggestions (e.g., wipe and install Indigo)?

Have you tried building them from sources?
Packages that work on Indigo most likely work in Kinetic as well.
