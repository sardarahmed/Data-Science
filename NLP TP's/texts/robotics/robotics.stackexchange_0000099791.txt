Q:

Ros Installation Win10 | rosout.exe not in directory

Hello Guys,
i installed ROS Melodic on Win10. Now when i run "roscore" the following error is displayed to me:
←[31mERROR: cannot launch node of type [rosout/rosout]: Cannot locate node of type [rosout] in package [rosout]. Make sure file exists in package path and permission is set to executable (chmod +x)←[0m←[31mRLException: failed to start core service [/rosout]←[0m←[31mThe traceback for the exception was written to the log file←[0m[master] killing on exit

I look in the path C:\opt\ros\melodic\x64\lib\rosout, but this folder is empty (Actually there should be a rosout.exe in there).
Could it be that something went wrong with my installation or you can somehow post-install this rosout.exe into this folder.
I am glad about answers
Nils

A:

A couple things to try:
Do an update first:
set ChocolateyInstall=c:\opt\chocolatey
choco upgrade all -y --execution-timeout=0

Then try,
choco upgrade ros-melodic-desktop_full -y if there is an error message, then try the following:
choco uninstall ros-melodic-desktop_full
choco config set cacheLocation c:\new_temp
choco install ros-melodic-desktop_full

If still fails, I'd try re-installing using the following instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows
