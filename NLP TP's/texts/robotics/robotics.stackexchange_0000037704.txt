A:

ROS is designed to run on full computers; not microcontrollers.
You need a full computer with at least several hundred MB of RAM (1GB is better) and a reasonably fast processor (1GHz+) to run navigation.
You may be able to port rosserial to your PIC and use it to pass control signals to and from a PC running ROS.
EDIT:
For Linux, I recommend downloading and installing Ubuntu. It's very easy and ROS is well-supported on ubuntu.
For ROS in general, start with the ROS Tutorials.
You'll want to either write a custom protocol and driver node to communicate with your PIC, or port rosserial to the PIC and use the rosserial driver to communicate over a serial port.
