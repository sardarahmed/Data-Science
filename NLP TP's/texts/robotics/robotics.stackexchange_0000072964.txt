Q:

ROS running on Raspberry PI 3

Hi,
I'm new to both ROS and Raspberry PI and need some good advice.
The software I want to run, has originally been written for the Raspberry PI 2.
Do you know if I will be able to run some ROS software written for RPi2 directly on the RPi3?
Specifically, I'm talking about http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/BlueROV.
Thanks and regards,
Andreas

A:

I haven't received my RPi 3 yet but as I see from documentation, there is nothing that should break backwards compatibility.
The only thing about it is in excessive heat generation: try to benefit from infinite heatsink around your underwater vehicle :)

Hello, I plan to use RPi 3 for better performance in my project, but the problem I think is that we can use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in RPi2 which provides easy way to install ROS. Installing ROS in Rasbian is so difficult. Can we still use same Ubuntu in RPi 3? I am not sure.

Yes, you can choose between Ubuntu MATE (https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/) and original 32-bit Ubuntu: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi
64-bit for ARM has not become stable yet.
ROS on Debian is not that hard to implement :)

Thank you, but I still have two questions. First, I use indigo, but it only support OS up to 14.04. But most ubuntu on pi3 are higher than 14.04. Maybe jade can be installed in them, but some packages are still flaw in jade. Second, I don't know if packages are well supported in Debian?

I can just use apt-get to install them or I have to compile them by myself?
