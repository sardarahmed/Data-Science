Q:

ros slam course

Hi,
I try to learn slam on ros slam course.
But I only find the first piece of slam course.
Where are the others which will teach how to implement slam functions on robot(not just simulation)?
Thank you~

There's a tutorial on building a map from logged data, with instructions on how to record the needed data from your robot.
