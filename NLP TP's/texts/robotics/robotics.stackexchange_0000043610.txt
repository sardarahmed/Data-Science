Q:

Where can I download swistrack for ROS?

Hi everyone! I noticed that swistrack appears as one of the many stacks that uses roscpp however there's no wiki page, thus I have no idea where to download the source from.
Does anyone know where swistrack for ROS is hosted?
Best regards,
Gonçalo Cabrita

A:

using roslocate prints out this info:

$roslocate info swistrack
- svn:
    local-name: swistrack
    uri: http://ua-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/arrg/ua_experimental/swistrack

checking out the repo seems to have a non-standard makefile which downloads swistrack from a 3rd party repo and applies a ros-specific patch.
