Q:

How do I configure the HUSKY_GAZEBO_DESCRIPTION environment variable?

I've been trying to get the husky_gazebo package running on ROS Indigo. But when I try running :
"roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch"
I encounter an error that says :
"environment variable 'HUSKY_GAZEBO_DESCRIPTION' is not set"
Can somebody help me out please? :)
