Q:

Where to write code for pr2 robot simulator?

So at this link: http://wiki.ros.org/robot_script , commands for making the pr2 robot simulator perform certain actions are given. Where would I write this code and how would I run it so that the pr2 robot on the gazebo simulator performed these tasks?
Detailed instructions would be appreciated :)

A:

The robot_script package was experimental and is no longer supported. Please follow the tutorials as suggested (and previously: http://answers.ros.org/question/227339/what-to-do-on-the-pr2-robot-simulation/ )
