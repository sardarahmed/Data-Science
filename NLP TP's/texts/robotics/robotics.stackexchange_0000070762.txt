Q:

Is it possible to call ./executable from a launch file?

I'm using arduino-serial to send a string to arduino through serial port. I'm able to do this on the console:
./arduino-serial -b 9600 -p /dev/tty.usbserial -s 6
Is it possible to call this on a launch file?

A:

Adding to @Mehdi.'s answer, you can specify arguments.
<node pkg="my_package" type="arduino-serial" name="foo" args="-b 9600 -p /dev/tty.usbserial -s 6" />

Anyways these require that your executable files are located in a ROS package in order to utilize node tag.
