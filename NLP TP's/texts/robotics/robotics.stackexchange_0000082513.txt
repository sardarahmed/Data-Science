Q:

Display messages from rosbag

Hey,
I want to display the data in some messages from different rosbags. I don know what kind of messages each rosbag has but I want to be able to check that. And then be able to choose which message to display in a graph. My plan is to choose message from a GUI which I will design in QT. But I have problem with reading the data from rosbags messages without knowing exactly what every rosbag contains. Does anyone know how to approach this? (And I am new to ros (that you might have guessed) so please keep it simple).

What you describe sounds very much like rqt_bag, rqt_multiplot and plotjuggler. Perhaps you could look at those and see how they do it - if you cannot use those.

A:

rqt_bag and rqt_plot function almost exactly as your proposed solution. Here is a simple tutorial to view bag files and rqt_plot has a similar tutorial.
