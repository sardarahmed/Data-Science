Q:

Message files for Autoware.Auto

This is a very basic question but I am only starting to learn about Autoware.Auto, ROS 2, and all this toolchain used by them. One of the basics things that I am trying to do is locate the Autoware.Auto .msg files and take a look at them. But after clone the repository, could not find them.
Can someone explain the process of how the framework creates/generates them?
Thanks,
Gus

A:

What you're looking for may be https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/autoware_auto_msgs.
You can't just get it by cloning.
You can get it by doing the following in "How To Build".
ade$ vcs import < autoware.auto.$ROS_DISTRO.repos

Thanks very much! Two reasons I could not find the messages. First, I was looking at Autoware.Auto\AutowareAuto repo. I did not see that there is a different repo only for messages (Autoware.Auto\autoware_auto_msgs). And second, they are not .msg files but .idl files. I also did not know that messages could be specified in .idl files. Thanks for all!!
