Q:

openni_launch pointclouds not published in rviz

Hi,
openni_launch when ran gives the following error
[ERROR] [1324070131.410127857]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/compressed/set_parameters]
[ERROR] [1324070131.419698718]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/theora/set_parameters]

As given in the http://answers.ros.org/question/3210/complaint-from-openni_launch-on-already-advertised assuming that it doesn't make an impact i checked the rviz.
I can see the image but the pointcloud is not being visualized.
Even the status is "ok" for the pointcloud2 display in rviz.
I echoed the topic that is subscribed by the rviz on the command line and could see the point clouds being displayed.
Can someone tell what i am missing here.
I saw in some posts that a dynamic reconfigure has to be done for this node. In that case how do i do it.
Thanks,
Karthik

Any help on this :(

A:

You probably still have an earlier instance running, which roscore knows about.

When i am not running the roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch the rosservice list is showing "ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!" So i don c anyother instance running. I feel that the openni.launch is advertising the same thing twice but dont kno which code to check for the same.

Try rosservice list, I suppose. Only one node can advertise a given service. That is what the launch is complaining about.

Can you tell how to check that? I don have any other instance as such. But even in that case if rostopic is able to echo that, why is it not subscribed by rviz.

If the roscore is being started by roslaunch, it will terminate when the launch does. You can avoid that by running it separately, before roslaunch.
