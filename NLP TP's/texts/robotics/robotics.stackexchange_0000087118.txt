A:

To skip building specific packages in your workspace you can use the --skip-packages argument for ament:
From ament --help:
  --skip-packages [SKIP_PACKAGES [SKIP_PACKAGES ...]]
                        Set of packages to skip

AMENT_IGNORE is a marker file that can be dropped in any directory of your workspace. This  will tell the build tool to not enter that directory. It is similar to ROS1's CATKIN_IGNORE
For more information about symlink install you can refer to the "Optional symlinked install" section of the ament design article
