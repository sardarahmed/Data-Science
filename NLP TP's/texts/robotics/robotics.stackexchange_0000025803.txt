Q:

Control Joints in Gazebo 1.4 not working

Hey,
I installed gazebo 1.4 on my machine just yesterday and have been trying out the tutorials. In the last part of the Mobile Robot example the tutorial mentions the Control Joints option on right clicking the model. I'm not getting the option as mentioned. I'm just getting Move To, Delete and View. Is there something else that I need to install or do?

A:

There should be three very small white rectangles to the right of the 3D view. Those indicate you can grab that part with the mouse and slide open the Joints tab this way (grab + slide to the left).
