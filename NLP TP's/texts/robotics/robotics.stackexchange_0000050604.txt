Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: How to Start

Hello guys,
I have a question about ROS architecture and how to start up a nee robotic software.
I understand how ROS is organized about nodes, msgs, subscribers and so on.
After that my question is, I have a node that is related to a sensor and this sensor publish data. I have another module that will be its subscriber. My doubt is related to the usage of this data and how can I create my program, where can I insert my behavior.
Will this data be used by my custom application that is aware about the message and how to parse it ? or can I use other more complex nodes? in this case how can I customize the software?
I have not found any information about to start up a new software? I mean about the first step and high level point of view of the architecture.
Thanks a lot for your time.
Regards,

A:

I think that the ROS Tutorials are the best starting point. Specifically number 11/12... but to get to those you should work the preceding ones.
If your application requires the creation of a custom message this would have been covered in tutorial 10.. but you should check the existing "standard" messages to make sure that you're not reinventing the wheel.
