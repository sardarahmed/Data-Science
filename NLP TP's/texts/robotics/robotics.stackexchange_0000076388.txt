Q:

ros3djs Inverse kinematics

Hi Everyone,
I am new to ROS. I have a simple three link robotic arm, and I would like to find the inverse kinematics for the joint angles.
I already have the URDF. I want to click in a 3D space in the web browser widget and the end effector should point to that location.
Are there any tutorials on how to do this?
Thank You!

You would like the end effector to reach that 3D space, or be pointing to it (outside of reach)? Both very different problems.

A:

MoveIt! is a popular choice for inverse kinematics. Take a look at the documentation. The tutorials there will help you to configure a solver and use RViz for controlling your arm.
Once that's working, it's just a small step to use InteractiveMarkers in ros3djs to do the same from a web browser.
