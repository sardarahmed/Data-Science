Q:

Is it possible to hack the laser_assembler to not convert laser scans into point clouds?

I have a turtlebot with a kinect and a hokuyo laser scanner, the goal is to use both scanners /scan topics for gmapping.
Is there a way to hack the laser_assembler to not convert laser scans into point clouds but merge both laser scan data and its tf anyway?

A:

No.
Just use the hokuyo for mapping and localization. Having a single sensor with a more consistent view of the world will usually give better results.
(when doing navigation, the navigation stack supports use many sensors for obstacle avoidance)
