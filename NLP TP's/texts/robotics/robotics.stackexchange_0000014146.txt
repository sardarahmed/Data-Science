Q:

Raspberry Pi and Buzzers: Simple solution

I have a Raspberry Pi 1 Model A and am interested in attaching a buzzer to its GPIO pins so that the software (running on the pi) can turn the buzzer on/off by sending signals to the GPIO pins.
I'm new to electronics so I'm looking for the simplest setup possible. I watched this Youtube video where the author just plops a buzzer down into a breadboard and uses jumper wires to connect the breadboard/buzzer to the pi's GPIO pins. I'd like a similar (simple!) setup.
I'm wondering what the make/model/specs are for that buzzer so that I can buy the same one and attach it to my pi/breadboard the exact same way (or if there's a simpler way out there, I'm open to that as well!). Any ideas what the voltage/amperage ratings would need to be so as to be compatible with the pi (without the need for additional things like circuit drivers, resistors, transistors, etc.)? Remember, I'm a total newb here and simpler == better!
Thanks in advance!

A:

For a beginner, it is always best to follow / copy an existing example.  Fortunately, a tutorial about connecting a sound device to a Raspberry Pi and parts are available here. Also, there is a Raspberry Pi Stackexchange web site (should you have more Raspberry Pi questions).
Any device connected to an embedded processor must operate at the voltages the embedded processor is operating at and must not draw more current than the embedded processor can supply safely.  The voltage and current ratings of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins are discussed here. 
The above tutorial is more complex than a simple buzzer.  As it appears to be able to play music.  But the tutorial is complete and physically it does not appear any more complex than the circuit in the youtube video linked to in the question.  Rather, the complexity is in the software which likely can just be downloaded and used.
