Q:

Rosaria P3-DX does not syn

Hello,
I'm trying to use a P3-DX pionner, I installed ROSARIA. When I try to use rosrun the robot does not syn.
    

    [ INFO] [1439822848.983522504]: RosAria: using port: [/dev/ttyUSB0]
    Could not connect to simulator, connecting to robot through serial port /dev/ttyUSB0.

    Failed to connect to robot.
    [ERROR] [1439822855.737404764]: RosAria: ARIA could not connect to robot! (Check ~port parameter is correct, and permissions on port device.)
    [FATAL] [1439822855.737519583]: RosAria: ROS node setup failed... 

I've been checking several answers but so far no improvements. Any ideas on how to make this syn?

It's probably a port problem I don't understand  how this PORT thing works. I used the command sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0 and after this rosrun rosaria RosAria _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0.

Thx so much.

A:

I found the problem.
I had to EDIT the RosAria.cpp file.
In the file in the line 270 there is  n.param("baud", serial_baud, 0); This needs to be changed to your robot's baud rate. In my casen.param("baud", serial_baud, 115200);
Then catkin_make.
Now it connects! Progress!

The third argument in the param method is a default value for a node parameter.   In rosaria,  0 is used as a special case to let ARIA use its default value.   See my answer below regarding setting the value of the baud parameter.
