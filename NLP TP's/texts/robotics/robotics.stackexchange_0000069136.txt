Q:

Amcl defaut scan topic?

Hi,
I'm using amcl with a defaut topic scan and it keep telling me:
"No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published) for XXX seconds"
I have double check my topic scan and made an initial pose with RViz.
Thanks for your answers.

A:

Okay, the only question I see here is: "What is the amcl default topic?".
Answering this:
The default topic of amcl is scan (see the ROS wikipage on amcl or the sourcecode for this).
If this is not the question, please be more specific, add a real question and the launch/config files. Otherwise, we cannot help at all.
