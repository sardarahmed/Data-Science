Q:

Custom Recovery Behavior

Hi,
I am using a diff drive robot for navigation and exploration in the environment. And i don't wanna using recovery_behavior that in the navigation package.  My aim is using my custom recovery behavior. How can i add my custom behavior to the navigation stack?
Thanks all.

A:

For just using custom recovery behaviors it is really simple, you just have to define them in the configuration of move_base :
recovery_behaviors:
   - name: 'conservative_reset1'
     type: 'clear_costmap_recovery/ClearCostmapRecovery'

For the name you chose whatever you want but the type is the package where the recovery behavior is defined.
However if you want to write custom recovery behaviors you will need to make them implement the
nav_core::RecoveryBehavior interface and create the dedicated ros package.
I suggest you emulate what is done for the rotate recovery behavior that can be found in the navigation package:
rotate
If you use catkin you can easily create the package structure with:
catkin_create_pkg my_recovery roscpp nav_core
