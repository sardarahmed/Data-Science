Q:

Can I use the Python Ros bag API without making a workspace?

I'm using roscpp, but I'd like to make a transferrable python script for working with bag files. However, the docs only tell me how to do it through a catkin workspace. Is there a way to import the necessary libraries without first making a workspace?
I'm referring to the error mentioned in this post
The proposed solution was to change a manifest file. I'd like to be able to do this without going through a workspace so I can share the script with others.

A:

yes, you can.
to avoid that error you have to make sure you have properly set the ROS path in your current terminal window, which is normally accomplished by doing:
source /opt/ros/ROSVERSION/setup.bash

Ah hah! I did this already, but I found that the problem is actually that I was trying to execute the python program through my Sublime editor. For anyone that might have had the same problem, I just needed to change the python build file to include the ros folders in PYTHONPATH and PATH.
