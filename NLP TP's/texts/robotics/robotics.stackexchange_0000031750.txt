Q:

Sensor out of bounds

Hello. I've attached the result of the rxgraph. I've created a node which is sending commands to the move_base_node, my map is a static one published by map_server, I'm using amcl to obtain the map->odom transform. My configure files are ok, in the global_costmap my map is set to static. I'm getting the following error.
The origin for the sensor at (0.15, -0.00) is out of map bounds. So, the costmap cannot raytrace for it.

Im sending the following goal coordinates (wx,wy)
wx=-0.014118, wy=-0.031483, mx=4, my=3

I'm getting this error, my map is 492x583 with the resolution of 0.016. The map is attached, the robot is set to (0.9, 7.7)

The goal sent to the navfn planner is off the global costmap. Planning will always fail to this goal.

Thank you!

A:

You should not use a static map from one source and the transformation from another. They don't match this way.
If you want to use a static map from the map server, use localization.
This tutorial shows how to use it: Using custom maps
