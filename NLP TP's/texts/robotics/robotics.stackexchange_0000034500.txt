Q:

Moving packages to different directory

Hi all,
I was working on a package in a folder (~/workspace/Mypackage) the package was originally at this place when i came. I work on it and now that is ready I want to move it to (~/svn/stacks/Mypackage) this in order to update the svn repository with my modifications.
I copy the entire folder, delete the CMakeCache.txt ("find -name CMakeCache.txt -delete") in this folder. Update the address of myPackage at .bashrc, then i do rosmake and it didn't complain. I run my package and it works fine. But this happen while mi original package is also in the original place, i mean, while i have the 2 copies of my package (one in svn folder and the other in workspace folder) all work fine, i can run it without problems (if i do "roscd myPackage" it gets me to the package at svn folder and if i do "env | grep ROS" it returns
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/diamondback/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/jose/svn/stacks:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

So ROS only know the package at svn folder...
When i delete the original package (the one at workspace) and then re-run my package it fails. If i rebuild it, it say that it dind't find some files (at the build folder in workspace location)
How i should do the transition between my packages? and why it complain for some files (the folders are exactly the same) how i should rebuild in order to generate all the files needed in the new location?
UPDATE: The error that return the package when i move it to a different location is that it doesn't find the files included "No such file or directory"
Thanks

Under {{{myPackage/}}}, where are your header files? Do you have an {{{include_directories()}}} in CMakeLists.txt?

A:

Try
$ rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles cmake_install.cmake msg_gen srv_gen src/myPackage
$ cmake .
$ rosmake

That has worked for me a bunch of times when doing exactly what you are trying to do. Basically, try to remove all auto-generated files and then build again.

The errors are basically that it didn't file included files... And if i compile my package with the original in his place (when all work fine) and then rename/delete the original and try to run the new one it fails. I really don't know what is happening...

I also do that and it usually worked... but this time it don't... I remove the auto-generated files, did a cmake . and then a rosmake and is the same. If i do it with the original package in his place all work fine, if i delete or change the name of the original package it return compilation error
