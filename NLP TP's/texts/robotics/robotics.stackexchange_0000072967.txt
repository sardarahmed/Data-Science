Q:

Found the following, but they're either not files, or not executable:

Hi all!
rosrun using_markers basic_shapes
Couldn't find executable named basic_shapes below /home/tunc/catkin_wws/src/using_markers

rosrun using_markers basic_shapes.cpp
Found the following, but they're either not files, or not executable
/home/tunc/catkin_wws/src/using_markers/src/basic_shapes.cpp

I have problem like this. Can somebody help me? Thanks...

A:

You haven't compiled your workspace, this is why it only finds the .cpp and not the executable.
You have to run a catkin_make and have your CMakeLists.txt and package.xml configured correctly.
Check out section 4.3 and the last lines of section 4.1 here.

Ok but when i try to run catkin_make an error like this occurs
The specified base path "/home/tunc/catkin_wws/src/using_markers" contains a package but "catkin_make" 
must be invoked in the root of workspace.

You need to run catkin_make in /home/tunc/catkin_wws/, not in /home/tunc/catkin_wws/src/.

catkin_make worked. I know i am asking too much :D but when i try to run rosrun using_markes basic_shapes it says
Error: package 'using_markes' not found

How do i handle that?

Did you source /home/tunc/catkin_wws/devel/setup.bash after catkin_make?
Comment by tuncguclu on 2016-03-23:
No but i did now and still says the same thing.

You need to do this in every terminal you use a ROS command.
Can you past the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH as well as the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt of your package? Please edit your question and format the files respectively using the preformatted text button (the one with 1s and 0s).
