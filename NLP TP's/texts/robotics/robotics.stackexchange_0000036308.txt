Q:

Recursive rosmake --mark-installed

While using "rosmake -i" for a package that depends on a couple of other packages, I realized that the "-i" flag, which creates ROS_NOBUILD file, operates only on the current package and not its dependencies. I think it is desirable to either modify behavior of "--mark-installed" option to mark the package and its dependencies as "installed" or introduce a new option, say "--mark-installed-recursive", that will do the job. Any comments are appreciated!
