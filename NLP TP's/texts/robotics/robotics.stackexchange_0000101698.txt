A:

Based on this related question and it's answer:

Could you try sourcing Gazebo's setup
after sourcing your workspace? . /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
This is needed to set some necessary
environment variables in case they're
going to be overridden, which is a
common use case. More context in this
issue.
