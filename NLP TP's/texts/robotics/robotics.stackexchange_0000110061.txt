Q:

What is the alternative to a 

I am using Arduino Mega.
I wanted to configure it to create a ros2 topic using the ros2arduino header.
However, I found out that the header cannot be used because it can only be supported from 32bit or higher
In this case, what idea can you recommend?
Currently, the board is connected to I2C communication, and it seems that the main board will also be connected to Arduino through I2C communication.
(Currently, I am connecting from Ubuntu installed on my PC for testing purposes.)
Thank you so much for reading.

A:

If you don't have to use I2C, why don't you try Serial?
Here seems to be an example of an interface that can communicate serially with Ros2.
