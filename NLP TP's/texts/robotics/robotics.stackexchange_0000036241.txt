Q:

Convention for value in static transform publisher node

I would like to check my understanding, whether it is right or wrong regarding the parameter value when using static_transform_publisher node tutorial. For example, like below:
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_link_to_laser" 
  args="1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 /base_link /laser 40" />

So, the x-value set there as 1.0 is in meter right?

A:

That is correct, all distance/length measurements are in meters, angles are in radians. In general you should reference Standard Units of Measure and Coordinate Conventions document is you have any doubts about units.
