Q:

catkin_make Â» /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcsparse

Hi,
I'm trying to get LSD_SLAM working but when running the catkin_make command at 91% I get the error message /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcsparse. 
I already tried to softlink using this command sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libg2o_solver_csparse.so /usr/bin/lcsparse.so but this doesn't fix it. 
here is the full error message: 

[ 91%] Linking CXX shared library /home/adas/lsd-slam_workspace/devel/lib/liblsdslam.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcsparse
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
lsd_slam/lsd_slam_core/CMakeFiles/lsdslam.dir/build.make:755: recipe for target '/home/adas/lsd-slam_workspace/devel/lib/liblsdslam.so' failed
make[2]: *** [/home/adas/lsd-slam_workspace/devel/lib/liblsdslam.so] Error 1
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:2385: recipe for target 'lsd_slam/lsd_slam_core/CMakeFiles/lsdslam.dir/all' failed

Makefile:140: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make -j4 -l4" failed

To be honest I don't know that else I should try as there is nothing called lcsparse in apt either.
Best regards,
Alex

A:

I opened an issue on Stackoverflow too.
Eventually found the solution myself.
