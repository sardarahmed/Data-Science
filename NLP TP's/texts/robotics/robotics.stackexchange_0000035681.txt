Q:

How to use NODELET_DEBUG()

Probably this is a stupid question, but I couldn't the answer in google or the ros wiki information about nodelets.
I'm using a launch file to launch a nodelet (in fact I've been using different nodelets) which is using NODELET_DEBUG(...) and NODELET_INFO(...) to output information. But in the console I only see the INFO output.
In http://www.ros.org/wiki/nodelet they say that "They also have the advantage that you can turn one specific nodelet into debug, instead of all nodelets of a specific type".
How can I see the DEBUG output? Is there a way to configure it in the launch file?
Thanks in advance

A:

By default, only ROS_INFO() level messages (and above) appear in the console output.
You can change that on a per-logger granularity by setting the logger level in rxconsole.
There are also ways to set the logger configuration before a node starts running.

Thank you, the rxconsoleloggerlevel is what I was looking for.
