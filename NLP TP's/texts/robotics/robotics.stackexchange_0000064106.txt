Q:

How to calculate bandwidth requirements for rosserial link?

We are beginning to prototype a small robot with differential drive, an IMU, and multiple sensors. For the first iteration we plan to put an Arduino with rosserial on the robot and run ROS on a PC. I want to calculate the bandwidth needed for the expected message traffic to determine if rosserial will work for us or if we need to use a different approach, however I can't find any references to the size of ROS messages once they've been serialized.
Can anyone give me some advice on how to approach calculating this rather than running a simulation and measuring the bandwidth?
Cheers,
Mike

Nice question. Would perhaps be a good candidate for a feature request on the rosserial tracker: a tool that could automatically do this.

A:

Serialized messages in ROS are roughly the size that you'd expect them to be; that is, an int64 is 8 bytes, an float32 is 4 bytes, etc. Strings and variable-length arrays are serialized as a 4-byte length followed by the contents (no null terminator). Fixed-size arrays are serialized as a sequence of data, without the length. There is no padding.
I believe the rosserial protocol adds a bit of overhead because it transmits a topic ID along with each message; this should be  well-documented in the rosserial protocol docs.
