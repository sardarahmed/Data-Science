Q:

R2D2 Tutorial, Using urdf with robot_state_publisher

Hi all,
I am trying to follow the r2d2 tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Using%20urdf%20with%20robot_state_publisher).  I ran
roscreate-pkg r2d2
I added dependencies to roscpp rospy std_msgs
and then I put the state_publisher.cpp file in r2d2/src.
I added rosbuild_add_executable(state_publisher state_publisher.cpp)
I added the launch file to the r2d2 directory as well.
When I try to run rosmake I get a fatal error:
'tf/transform_broadcaster.h' No such file or directory.
Although when I roscd to tf, I can find transform_broadcaster.cpp.
My questions are:

Do I have the r2d2 directory and files in the write places for how this tutorial should run or is there something I'm missing?
Why is it not finding tf/transform_broadcaster.h?

A:

1.launch file should be added to r2d2/launch directory. But this is not relevant to the problem.
2.Because you didn't depend this package on "tf".You can solve this problem by adding the dependency to manifest.xml.
For example, your manifest.xml should looks like
<package>
  <description brief="r2d2_try">

     r2d2_try

  <depend package="tf"/>

</package>

I can't because my karma has to be at 25.

Oh I mean pressing the check mark button in the left side of the answer zone instead of "closing" this question. This question might be helpful for other people in the future.
