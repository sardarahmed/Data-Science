Q:

Cannot display the urdf model in rviz (launch file)

Hello,
I am new to ROS and today I attempted to write a simple code for a launch file just to display my urdf model in rviz. I wrote this for a start:
<launch>
  <param name="robot_description" textfile="$(find labrob_description)/urdf/labrob.urdf" />
  <node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" required="true" />
</launch>

What I get is an empty rviz grid. Could you please explain me what I am doing wrong ?
I saw some ready codes and they work fine for me when I roslaunch them (they display my model correctly in rviz) and from what I got, these are the lines to display a urdf model. Am I right ?
Thanks for your time and your answer in advance,
Chris
I am adding also the urdf model code:

A:

To show the URDF, press the ADD button in the bottom left of Rviz and add a RobotModel to your configuration.

Thank you for the tip (I didn't notice the add button, because from the roslaunching of the display.launch code from the urdf_tutorial I could see the urdf model instantly). It worked for me partially, since now I can see some errors the rviz pops regarding "No transform from the links to the map".

Before I mark your answer as correct, I would like to ask you why the launch code I wrote doesn't present the urdf model instantly in rviz and I have to add it manually ? From some ready .launch files I read, these 2 lines refer to robot visualization. Correct ?
Thank you for your time answering.

The "ready .launch files [you] read" make RViz use a configuration file (.rviz) that already includes the RobotModel display that @David Lu suggested you add. The default configuration doesn't.
