Q:

svn ros revision 17341

Hi,
For cross-compiling ros, I used svn and it downloaded this revision. But can someone please tell me which version this is (e.g. Electric, Fuerte, ... ) ?
Thanks.

What url are you looking at?
Comment by hvn on 2013-09-05:
this is the url: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/tags/latest

A:

That is a very old repo, kept for historical/archive purposes only.  It's version 1.1.8 in that tag which is CTurtle (http://www.ros.org/news/2010/06/ros-118-released-feature-frozen.html)
I highly recommend you look at some of the recent work of others on cross compiling more recent versions of ROS using Open Embedded

Thank you for your info. That is very old indeed. Looking at OpenEmbedded.
