Q:

Difference Between Publisher Subscriber Model and Client Service Model

What exactly is the difference between the two? From what I gather, messages in a publisher/subscriber are only sent one way from publisher to subscriber but in the client/service model, messages can go both ways. Is this correct?

A:

There is a bit more to publish/subscribe and client/server (or remote-procedure-call) than just the direction in which messages flow.
A good paper that discusses the main benefits of the publish/subscribe communication style and compares it to traditional remote procedure call is The Many Faces of Publish/Subscribe by Patrick Eugster et al.
