Q:

Inverse kinematic orientation problem

I am trying IK for 5-DOF robot all revolute joint.
I am working IK with Jacobian inverse i.e
end effector velocity = J inverse * error vector.
In error vector I am feeding (x,y,z) positional error; this gives me correct positioning by first 3 joints only. later 2 joints are pitch and roll used for end effector orientation. How can I input my required orientation and calculate orientation error.
I have Jacobian matrix[6 X 5]  considering all 5 joints; so J inverse will be [5 X 6] matrix. Error vector [6 X 1] consisting first 3 element of positional error, but for last 3 element what should I feed to get required orientation for my robot and how would I calculate the orientation error and in which form I should input my orientation of end effector.
please help me out.

A:

Up till now, I am using the Euler angle representation but I have not been successful. After referring to the book "Robotics Modelling, Planning and control" by Bruno Siciliano form Springer publication. It is concluded that the Euler angle is only used for the manipulator having spherical wrist; the robot which doesn't have one need to use another representation i.e equivalent angle representation.
The orientation error vector or error in orientation can be calculated by the equivalent angle representation or angle-axis representation (both are same) of orientation. 
If $R_d$ denotes desired orientation matrix and $R_e$ denotes rotation matrix computed form joint variables, then orientation error is calculated using 
$$e_{O}=r \sin \vartheta$$
where $r$ and $v(nue)$ can be calculated from matrix multiplication as
$${R}(\vartheta, {r})={R}_{d} {R}_{e}^{T}({q})$$
This gives the $3 \times 1$ vector which is the orientation error about $X, Y, Z$ axis.
For more information one can refer book I mention above.
using equation
$$\begin{array}{l}{\vartheta=\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{r_{11}+r_{22}+r_{33}-1}{2}\right)} \\ {r=\frac{1}{2 \sin \vartheta}\left[\begin{array}{l}{r_{32}-r_{23}} \\ {r_{13}-r_{31}} \\ {r_{21}-r_{12}}\end{array}\right]}\end{array}$$
