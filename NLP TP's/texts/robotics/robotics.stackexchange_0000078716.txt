Q:

ROS Kinetic Husky Question

Hi,
When looking at the installation for the Clearpath HUSKY, the current available ISO image is for ROS Indigo.  Is there an ISO Image for ROS kinetic?
Thanks,
John

Hi John,
We are currently working on kinetic release for the Husky, there is no ISO currently but rather a general Kinetic iso.  In addition, there is a kinetic-devel that works minus the microstrain imu option. For kinetic, we made the  husky a changes to the husky metapackakge layout so please blacklist desktop packages to avoid installing the desktop environment. We do hope to have a full release soon.

There is a Kinetic branch: https://github.com/husky/husky/tree/kinetic-devel and you can read this link for troubleshooting: https://github.com/husky/husky/issues/66. It seems that the two main developers working on this left Clearpath Robotics.....
