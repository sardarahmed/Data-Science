Q:

Invalid argument passed to canTransform argument source_frame in tf2 frame_ids cannot be empty

I'm trying to see a point cloud in Rviz but when I add the topic to de Displays i get an error (Rviz) and in the terminal where i opened Rviz I get the following message:
Invalid argument passed to canTransform argument source_frame in tf2 frame_ids cannot be empty
I'm working with OpenDR, specifically with the 3D object detection module.
Warning in terminal:

Rviz error:

I'm trying to see other people's responses with the same issue, I have already tried it everything but this information is not valid for me.
The output of rostopic echo /tf:

for rostopic echo /opendr/dataset_point_cloud the output is:
header: 
  seq: 10053
  stamp:

A:

The error means that can_transform is being invoked with an empty string as the frame_id. As there doesn't appear to be any issues with your transform tree it's mostly likely that the data in your dataset that you're playing back does not have the frame_id fields properly set.
