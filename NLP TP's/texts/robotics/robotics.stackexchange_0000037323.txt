Q:

Problem re-installing ROS

I have removed ROS in order to solve some problems I had, but I removed the "ros" folder in /opt sending it to the trash, which I think was a bad idea.
I have tried to reinstall ROS again, but when I do
$ sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full
only the "stacks" folder is created inside /opt/electric.
I have done
$ sudo apt-get remove ros-electric-desktop-full
and tried to reinstall it again, but i doesn't work.
What should I do to get ROS again, please?
Thank you

A:

I have already solved my problem.
I had to open Synaptic, look for ros-electric there, and mark for complete removal. Then I could reinstall it again.
