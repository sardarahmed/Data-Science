Q:

convert VLP16 sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 to sensor_msgs/LaserScan

I would like to test a library that require a sensor _msgs/LaserScan topic.
I found this question http://answers.ros.org/question/9450/how-to-setup-pointcloud_to_laserscan/ but I am pretty new to ROS and I have a lot of difficulties in adapting this solution to my case.
Could you help me with this?

What's the problem in your case? What exactly is the error when you run that launch file?

I do not know how to write a launch file for the VLP16. I got two default launch files but they are supposed to work with Kinect.

A:

There is Velodyne specific software:

I couldn't compile it on my laptop. I got:
but_calibration_camera_velodyne/Calibration.h:53:24: error: ‘isnan’ was not declared in this scope
 return !isnan(value);

Using your branch it seems working.
I see /scan and the output is ok.
