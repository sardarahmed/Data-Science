A:

Technically, your question is a C++ question, not a ROS question, and we should be closing this.
But just to point you in the right direction: the double colon (::) you see in C++ source code is called the scope resolution operator. It is used to tell the compiler in which scope the identifier (ie: name of something) that follows can be found.
If you search for "C++ scope resolution operator" you will probably find more than enough information about this (Wikipedia also has a page about it: wikipedia.org/Scope_resolution_operator).
