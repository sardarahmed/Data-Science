Q:

How to publish ROS program?

Like windows programs, hos to publish a single simple "setup" install package on ROS so that I can reduce server configuration work when transfer to other machine?
Is anyone has experience on this issue? Thanks!

Are you looking for windows versions or which system? Because in ubuntu it's just apt-get ros-indigo-desktop-full.

No, I mean, I made a ROS project on developing machine, and I want to transfer my ROS project to any other new business machines which is under ubuntu system, and I won't build the code again. how could I do to transfer the project easily like windows "One click install" program?

If the systems are binary compatible, after caktin_make install it should be sufficient to just copy the install directory and source the contained setup.sh in the user's setup. I'm not aware of any tools that do this though.

A:

There are no "one click install" for ROS as far as I know. You could always send a virtual machine or look at solutions like ansible. We have some ansible configs available here if you're interested. It's a work in progress, mostly for internal use so it's not fully documented but it should hopefully help you get started.

Thanks, dear Ugo, is there any other solution? Whether a simple shell script can solve the transfer problem or not?

Sorry for the long delay in answering. If you're still looking for a shell script solution we have something like this (https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr-build-tools/blob/master/bin/sr-install-indigo-source). You'll need to modify it to reflect your install obviously. Cheers
