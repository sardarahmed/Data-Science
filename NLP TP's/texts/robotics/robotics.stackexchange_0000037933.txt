Q:

Why the dependencies in actionlib tutorial include "roslib"?

In the introductary tutorial of actionlib package, the sand-box package is created with the dependency roslib. I check up the introduction of roslib package and realize that "roslib contains the definition of the ros::Time and ros::Duration objects used in roscpp and other ROS C++ libraries".
Then I opened a package, wrote a program, utilizing of the ros::Time and ros::Duration without the dependency of roslib. However it worked successfully.
Thus I'm wondering why the dependencies in actionlib tutorial include roslib.
Thanks for answering.

Is roslib not a library which implement ros::Time and ros::Duration? It seems we do not have to include that when we use ros::Time and ros::Duration. Thank you~

roslib is used for c++ and python. The wiki page explains this in more detail: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslib

I have seen this page before, and I found that I didn't notice roscpp and rospy use different way to run roslib. Thank you for this hint.
