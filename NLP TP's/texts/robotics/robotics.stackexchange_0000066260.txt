You might need to add some rules in :
etc/udev/rules.d

Were you able to view the image in RVIZ? I am having similar issue. I am able to see the image from rosrun rviz rviz command but the rosrun image_view . . . . command is not giving any data, just a blank screen.

I can view the image not only in RVIZ but also in image_view.I can not give you specific reason why you only have  a blank screen.I guess your image path have some problem if RVIZ can get the image, I suggest that you can follow the book "example by ROS" step by step to execution.

Hi,
I had the same problem two years ago. I could never get the Kinect picture to show until I stopped using a virtual machine and set up a dual-boot of Ubuntu.
Here are my steps:

Hope this helps.

worked for me, I bought a cheap laptop to run the ROS instead of using a vm on my good laptop.
Comment by Coco on 2015-03-12:
Thanks,I got the picture when I stopped using Vmware and Wubi.I guess the reason is I can not get the correct  drivers when i use Vmware.I got 3 driver when i use a natural Ubuntu12.04.
