Q:

How to add sick_tim551 to rviz and visualize the scan?

branch: turtlebot (hydro);
platform: ubuntu 12.04;
package:  ros-hydro-sick_tim
When I use the normal camera options I could visualize the RobotModel and the camera data correctly in RViz. Until I start the command roslaunch sick_tim 551_2050001.launch causes the RobotModel a status Error. What I have further to do to start laser scanner correctly? Do I have to start some other packages?

A:

There is no link called base_footprint in your URDF, so you need to select either laser or laser_mount_link as the fixed frame in RViz. Usually, you would create an URDF for your robot (which would include a base_footprint link) and include the laser scanner URDF from there. Have a look at the Calvin robot URDF and the URDF tutorials.
