Q:

Can't Install ardrone_autonomy

Currently I am running an instance of ROS Kinetic on an Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS and  trying to install the package ardrone-autonomy. However, the instructions on the linked page say that I can simply invoke the command:
apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy

Is it because the package is not available on kinetic? Do I have to build from source using these instructions below?
$ cd ~/ros_catkin_ws
$ rosinstall_generator ros_desktop <package_name> --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
$ wstool merge -t src kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
$ wstool update -t src
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y -r --os=debian:jessie
$ sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/kinetic

If so, where exactly is the /ros_catkin_ws folder? I used sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full install ROS, and the folder does not exist.

EDIT
Let me know what exactly I am doing wrong. When I invoke the command below, this is what I get:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy
Reading package lists... Done

The output of the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list is:

and uname -a is:

A:

tl;dr: OP is running 16.04 MATE LTS on an ARM device, and ardrone_autonomy has not been released for that platform (at least not as of 2017-01-23).

You don't tell us what is actually going wrong. Does apt-get give you an error when you invoke it? If so: please include that in your post.
Also: looking at ros_kinetic_default.html?q=ardrone and wiki/ardrone_autonomy it looks like ardrone_autonomy is released in Kinetic, so sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy should work.

Edit: I've just tested the following on a Docker container running Mate 16.04 x64 (after having setup ROS Kinetic according to the instructions on the wiki):
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy

This results in the following output:

It would seem that the problem is really at your end, as ardrone_autonomy is released for Kinetic and I can install it locally on a system similar to yours.
Can you try the following:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy

Please copy and paste these lines, one at a time, in a terminal, then press enter.
If that still doesn't work, see if cleaning the apt indices (see here for steps), updating and trying to install again works.

Edit2:

and uname -a is:

Linux rasp 4.1.19-v7+ #858 SMP Tue Mar 15 15:56:00 GMT 2016 armv7l armv7l armv7l GNU/Linux

This is partly my fault, as I should have asked about what system / platform you are using, but ardrone_autonomy is not released on ARM platforms (see status_page/ros_kinetic_uxhf.html?q=ardrone). If you'd checked the ros_kinetic_default.html?q=ardrone and wiki/ardrone_autonomy links I included earlier, you'd seen that those all mention x32, x64, i386 and amd64 only. No mention of arm anywhere.
That is the reason why apt-get can't find ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy.
If you want to use that package on ARM, you'll have to build from sources (that is the second exception to the "never build from sources, unless you have to" mantra: you'll have to if a package has not been released for your target platform.
PS: in future question, please include what CPU architecture / platform you are trying to run things on, as it would have saved us both (and future readers) a lot of time.

Check out the edit I made above.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-19:
And how did you install ROS? Can you install any ROS package using apt-get?
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-19:
Can you give me an example of a package that I can use, that's not in the ros-kinetic-desktop-full package and available for kinetic?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-19:\

that's not in the ros-kinetic-desktop-full package and available for kinetic

so you have installed the ros-kinetic-desktop-full package using apt-get?
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-19:
Yes, as mentioned in the question, I did use sudo apt-get ros-kinetic-desktop-full to install my ROS
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-19:
Mate 16.04 is essentially a regular Ubuntu release, so all Kinetic packages that are available for Ubuntu Xenial should be available for Mate. According to all the information we have, ardrone_autonomy is availale no kinetic, so it should work. Can you try a sudo apt-get update?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-19:
And no: you should not build Kinetic from source. It wouldn't make sense to build an entire ROS distribution from sources (and with the Debian Jessie instructions) for just a single pkg. If at all, you could build ardrone_autonomy from sources, but I'd try to resolve the apt thing first.
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-19:
so I just installed ros-kinetic-joy with the command sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joy
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
I just tried sudo apt-update, sudo apt-upgrade and sudo apt-get clean. Should I go ahead and install ardrone-autonomy using what was given as an answer in this question?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-23:
And after all the apt-get commands, did you try installing again (using sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ardrone-autonomy)?
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
Yes I did, and it still gives me the same error.
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
So should I go ahead with the answer on that question?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-23:
What is the output of apt-cache search ardrone?
And can you please be a little patient? Building from source should always be your last resort, unless you want to actually edit a pkg's sources.
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
I get nothing when I invoke apt-cache search ardrone
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
Sure, as long as we can zero in on the problem soon. I have to progress along this project soon.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-23:
If you don't get any output from apt-cache, something is not configured correctly. Please edit your original post and include the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list and the output of uname -a.
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
Just made the edits. Take a look at them.
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
So would I follow the instructions on the other question to install this package then?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-01-23:
Yes. In this case it would be acceptable to build from source. No guarantees that it will work though.
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
Alright, will try that now.
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
Should we clean up this comments section?
Comment by sharan100 on 2017-01-23:
Also I have posted a new question here related to this topic.
