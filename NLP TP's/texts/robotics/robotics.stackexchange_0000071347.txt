Q:

roscore: libconsole_bridge.so.0.2: cannot open shared object file

Hi,
I have ROS (Ros_Comm) installed on my beaglebone black with debian wheezy.
While running roscore I get:
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/rosout/rosout: error while loading shared libraries: libconsole_bridge.so.0.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

While I have libconsole-bridge-dev installed.
While installing that I got the message:
-- Installing: /usr/local/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libconsole_bridge.so.0.2.

And nothing failed.
But in the rosout file :
libconsole_bridge.so.0.2 => not found is stated.

Does someone know how I can fix this, I think because libconsole is located at /usr/local/lib.
I tried editting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /opt/ros/indigo/lib:/opt/ros/indigo/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf:/usr/local/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf, but that doesnt seem to help.
And I cant seem to edit the rosout file.
Greetings
Kenavera

A:

Well the

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/lib:/opt/ros/indigo/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf:/usr/local/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf

did fix it. Only the system was durping or, so. Now it works perfectly.
