Q:

Building up a connection between the Turtlebot3 and Remote PC

Hey,
i am just trying to configure my turtlebot3 to learn how to control it etc. Right now I tried to fix the missing connection between the turtlebot3 and my laptop. I did the Instructions from the Turtlebot3 website and set IP addresses for the Remote PC and the Turtlebot3. Both are running under the same wifi. I just ran roscore on my Remote PC and "roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch" on my turtlebot with the follwing results (roscore looks good):
Remote PC:
marcel@marcel-macbookpro:~$ roscore
... logging to /home/marcel/.ros/log/e71bc2f6-8857-11e9-bc78-6003088fd8da/roslaunch-marcel-macbookpro-2513.log

**ERROR: unable to contact ROS master at [http://172.11.111.70:11311]**
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I then tried to do the network setup with ssh and ping. Basically, I can ping the machines for  itself but not between each other. For the ssh, I get the following error for both, Turtlebot3 and RemotePC:
marcel@marcel-desktop:~$ ssh 172.11.111.112
ssh: connect to host 172.11.111.112 port 22: Connection refused

Would be great if somebody has a solution for that problem.
Kindly,
Marcel

Do you have control over the WiFi setup? Sounds like a firewall may be issue. My Wifi router has a public and private interface. Devices on the public network are not allowed to communicate with each other. Only internet access. On the private network, communication is allowed between devices. Maybe something similar.  Anyway, it isn't a ROS issue if you can't even ping.
Does each computer have internet access? At least that way you're sure they're both really connected to WiFi.

Hey billy,
both devices have wifi access and i can ping each device for itself (if I just ping the address of the device).
The wifi network is a public university network, so I dont have a access to the settings.
I tried to fix the ssh thing first, but without access.
What I thought about what might work is, that I can connect my Remote PC by Ethernet Cable and let it act as a wifi router (I own a MacBook). I will try that before I go deeper to the actual network.

Okay. Your hint was right. It really was a network issue due to a private/ public network.

OK, I'll convert my comment to answer. Then you can mark it correct.
