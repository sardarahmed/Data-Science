Hello everyone, I'm taking the first steps in ROS studing, and i have a question. I installed ROS kinetic and it works fine, but when I call any comand  from rxtools package, I get a message that the comand not found, what could be the problem?

I have the impression that you're trying to follow some tutorial or howto, and that that is telling you to start something from rxtools. It would be good to know whether that is true, and which tutorial or howto it is.

A:

rxtools is a very old package and has been replaced by rqt quite some time ago.

when I call any comand from rxtools package, I get a message that the comand not found, what could be the problem?

Well, technically of course the problem is that the package is really not installed. There is no release of rxtools for Kinetic.
I would suggest you try and achieve whatever you're trying to do with rqt and one of its plugins.
