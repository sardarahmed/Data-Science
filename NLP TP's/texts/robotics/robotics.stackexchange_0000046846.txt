Q:

Robotino make error

Hi guys,
I am using ros fuerte and ubuntu 12.04, I am trying to use the robotino stacks and have followed the instructions from http://wiki.openrobotino.org/index.php?title=ROS, I have downloaded the api2 packages on my laptop running ubuntu 12.04. The CF card has an image of version 2.4 (I think api1).  I know I need to update my CF card to api2. But I still expected the make to be successful (even if the connection to robotino will fail until I update the CF card to api2). I have added the robotino-ros-pkg to my ROS PACKAGE PATH. When I run the comand : $ rosmake --pre-clean robotino
I get the following error at the end:
Linking CXX executable ../bin/robotino_camera_node
/usr/local/robotino/api2/lib/librec_robotino_api2.so: could not read symbols: File in wrong format

Any ideas why I am getting this error?  /usr/local/robotino/api2/lib/librec_robotino_api2.so: could not read symbols: File in wrong format
Thanks and best regards,
Khalid

A:

Ok so I realized I had installed the i386 api2 packages instead of the amd64 api2 packages. I then recieved another float conversion error problem so I added this line to the cmakelists.txt:
add_definitions (-Wall -O3 -funroll-loops -fpermissive)
and the build was successful.
regards
Khalid
