Q:

Use RTAB-Map with ORB_SLAM2 in ROS

Hello everyone,
I successfully compiled RTAB-Map with Orb-Slam2, so I can now choose ORB-SLAM2 as an odometry strategy in RTAB-Map standalone app. Now I would like to use it inside ROS. I guess that maybe it is not implemented yet? Logically, I would expect it to be one of the parameters in rgbd_odometry node. But there is nothing like it in documentation. Or maybe I am wrong and it exists somewhere and I do not know where...
What do you recommend then? Should I launch orb slam 2 in ros and get odometry from tf, which is published by orbslam2 node and use it in rtabmap? Kind of a puzzle for me.
Thank you for any help!

A:

If you have successfully built ORB_SLAM2 inside RTAB-Map library and that you could use it with the standalone, you should be also able to use it in ROS through rtabmap_ros/rgbd_odometry and rtabmap_ros/stereo_odometry nodes. Just set Odom/Strategy to 5 and set ORB_SLAM2 vocabulary path with OdomORBSLAM2/VocPath:
<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rgbd_odometry" name="rgbd_odometry">
   ...
   <param name="Odom/Strategy" value="5"/>
   <param name="OdomORBSLAM2/VocPath" value="PATH/TO/ORB_SLAM2/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt"/>
</node>

To see more parameters related to ORB_SLAM2 in RTAB-Map, see here or do
$ rtabmap --params | grep ORBSLAM2

cheers,
Mathieu
