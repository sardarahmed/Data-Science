Q:

PlanningScene Message fields

In the PlanningScene message definition there is a field:
#additional frames for duplicating tf
geometry_msgs/TransformStamped[] fixed_frame_transforms

My understanding is that the robot state (or whatever other field in the message) will be transformed (translated, rotated) by the amount specified in the fixed_frame_transforms (chaining?)
Is this correct? Is this a way to plan starting from a robot position which is not the real one?

A:

Lorenzo,
The purpose of this field is so that we can re-create a full snapshot of the TF tree given a PlanningScene.  In the robot_state we store the transform between the world frame and the robot frame as well as all the joint states, but this doesn't include frames that are not associated with the robot, such as a /map frame if we operating in /odom_combined, extra world sensors frames, and the like.  As I answered in this question, you just want to set different values in the robot_state member of the planning_scene_diff to pose the robot in a different location.
