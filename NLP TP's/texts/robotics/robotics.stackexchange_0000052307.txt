Q:

Shutdown rosout

Hey, I have a ros application that has a GUI on top of it.  When I close the window from the GUI, I call ros::shutdown() in all of my nodes.  I checked to make sure I was killing all my nodes by using rosnode list. All my nodes are shutdown but rosout is still alive.  Is there a way to get rosout to shutdown without SIGINT? I would like my program to exit cleanly when the GUI window closes.
Thanks!!

A:

I think rosout is kept alive by the roscore process. If you didn't want to send a SIGINT, you could try the answer on this question and add required="true" to one of your nodes that shuts down. That's if the core was launched with the launch file, of course.
