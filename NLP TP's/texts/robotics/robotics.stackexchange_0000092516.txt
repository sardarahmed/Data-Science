Q:

"Couldn't find executable named mono_odometer below ..."

I can successfully rosrun other executables such as rosrun image_view image_view image:=/cv_camera/image_rect_color and other packages including the listener and talker tutorial. I'm having trouble getting visual odometry from the viso2_ros package (http://wiki.ros.org/viso2_ros) following this tutorial (https://www.instructables.com/id/ROS-Visual-Odometry/) when trying to call rosrun viso2_ros mono_odometer image:=/cv_camera/image_rect. I get
Couldn't find executable named mono_odometer below /home/usr/catkin_ws/src/viso2/viso2_ros

but I've noticed mono_odometer is under /home/usr/catkin_ws/src/viso2/viso2_ros/src, Perhaps I need to change something in CMakeLists.txt? It looks the same as cloned from (https://github.com/srv/viso2). I already trade chmod +x-ing mono_odometer.cpp. It is probably some gap in my knolwedge.

A:

Turns out I wasn't even compiling mono_odometer. I had been using catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="pkg1;pkg2" to build only certain packages. I tried building only viso2 using that command, but I checked ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/viso2_ros/ and nothing had been built there. I rebuilt using the conventional catkin_make and now the node runs as expected. Maybe something else is going on there.
I thank @gvdhoorn for trying to help.
