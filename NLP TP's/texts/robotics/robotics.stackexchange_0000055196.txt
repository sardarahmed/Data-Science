Q:

What is the best way to connect an APM controller to ROS?

I have a few multicopters with an APM controller that I would like to connect to ROS. I want to access the mavlink data via ROS topics. Minimally, I want to have access to sensor data and then publish control topics to the UAV for some semi autonomous indoor fun.
I see there are a few options out there for packages, does anyone out there have recommendations or helpful hints to get started?
Thanks!

Is roscopter compatible with ros indigo ?

Would strongly advice against that, use mavros.
