Q:

integrating XYZ sensor with Turtlebot...?

Hi
I would appreciate much if you can give me a north on how to integrate a sensor which gives me x,y and z coordinates data with the Turtlebot robot using ROS.
I guess the robot_pose_ekf package is a good place to start.
We have the sensor. it is a non commercial sensor. it just gives me the spherical coordinates with respect to a fixed beacon. I can convert these to cartesian coordinates. I would like to integrate this data as part of ROS odometry and use it for the Turtlebot.
I would appreciate much your response.
Regards,
Luis.

Thanks. I should be more specific. We have the sensor. it is a non commercial sensor. it just gives me the spherical coordinates with respect to a fixed beacon. I can convert these to cartesian coordinates. I would like to integrate this data as part of ROS odometry and use it for the Turtlebot.
