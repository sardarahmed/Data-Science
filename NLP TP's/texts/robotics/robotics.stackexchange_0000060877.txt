Q:

difference between octomap and voxel grid?

hello everyone,
I am new in ROS, and I would like to know the defference betwen octomap and voxel_grid ?
I have looking for information on internet but I have find the same information for both of them.
I have seen these videos about octomap and voxel_grid on youtube ( watch?v=y5tGI3Fln_4 and watch?v=y5tGI3Fln_4 )
If someone can explain the defference to me, or guide me to a webpage ?
thank you,
Guillaume

And Voxel grid is like 3d occupancy grid map with fixed resolution.

Which one is faster (or better)?

OcTree is faster and hence better.
