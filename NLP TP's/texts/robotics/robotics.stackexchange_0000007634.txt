Q:

Arduino original or generic for a beginner?

I'm new to the robotics and electronics world, but I'm willing to dive into it. I'm a software developer and I want to create a project that uses GPS and Accelerometer data to show as a layer on Google Maps after transferred to PC.
My doubt is about which controller to get. In my country, there are generic controllers based on the Atmega328 that are being sold with a massive difference of price from the original Arduino (talking about the UNO model). 
Should I start with an original model? 
Should I expect to break the controller, fry it, or break any components by connecting them wrong? 
Would the experience with a generic controller be less exciting than with the original Arduino one?

A:

If you're just starting out, you should probably use the original Arduino instead of a generic.
Let's say you follow an Arduino example using a generic, and things don't work the way you expect.  How will you know whether your Arduino code (or circuit) is the problem, and not the generic board?  
In all actuality, a generic board will probably work fine.  The best choice for you will come down to how confident you can be in troubleshooting.
