Q:

how do i load plugin from sdf model in ros

Similarly like i can put a plugin in urdf file and than when i launch that urdf in gazebo i can control that robot, isn't their any way how i can contol the robot model. I tried to use this line in my launch file but its not working:
<param name="robot_description" textfile="$(find <my_robot>)/model.sdf"/>

So is their any way how i can use the plugin from sdf robot to my gazebo ros control package or robot_description src file similarly like i did with urdf file. Like when i launchdd the urdf file with plugins in them, i can communicate with the robot from my plugin file than use ros control. Similarly i loaded the sdf robot in my world file than when i launchd it from my roslaunch file the plugin is not loaded.
Why i want to do this was, because so many robot models like r2, kuka and others where present in sdf format so i want to communicate them from my ros package.
I am using ros indigo and gazebo 7.4 for robot simulation.
Why is this happening that when i spawn a urdf robot in gazebo rviz and ros can communicate with it by plugins but not with sdf robot?

A:

Have you gone through ros_gzplugins tutorial? Either way, it'd be helpful for others if you share the resources you referred to, and also share the codes you used. (i.e. by verbally saying when i launchdd the urdf file with plugins in them, i can communicate with the robot from my plugin file than use ros control doesn't make much concrete sense to others unfortunately).
