i am running it on 12.04 and my /.bashrc ros_package_ path is as follows:                                     export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros:/home/lab/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks

A:

I believe you don't have the ROS joystick drivers installed. As a result, rosdep is unable to find the ROS package joy, and cannot resolve its system dependencies. You can test this by running the command:
rospack find joy

If you get an error, you can install joystick-drivers by running the following command:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-joystick-drivers

followed by
rosdep install joy

I'm having issues with this too. For some unknown reason, this doesn't work. I updated the rosdep sources, but the joy headers are still not recognized.

Could you elaborate on your problem. Do you have the joystick-drivers stack installed? where does the failure appear?

I have a similar issue, except with several packages. I used 'sudo apt-get' to get them, and they display their locations when I do 'locate  ' but rosdep just returns "No Valid Packages or stacks listed as arguments" when I attempt to rosmake my package or do rosdep install

@jker: it seems like you have a different problem. I think your package is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (i.e. ROS cannot locate it). With locally built code, you need to use a tool like rosinstall/rosws, or manually list package locations. See http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables
