Q:

Why use move_base when mapping?

As I studied the tutorial [SLAM Map Building with TurtleBot](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/indigo/Build a map with SLAM) and tutorial Mapping and Navigation with Turtlebot, I found that move_base is used in their launch files. My understanding is that when building a map, the robot is controlled by the keyboard.Why use move_base? What does move_base do here?

A:

Depends. If you teleop your robot to explore the area you do not need move_base.
But you could also make the robot automatically explore the area, e.g. using frontier exploration. This would require all nodes for autonomous navigation.

Thanks.
By the way, if I want to use the navigation stack to create my own navigation package, which packages should I add as dependencies? Is it possible to directly add navigation or turtlebot_navigation as a dependency?

Please open a new question for that. If you are the only one using this package I would not bother. If others should use it please add only the required packages.
