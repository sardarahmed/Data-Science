Q:

How do I run and control more than one Turtlebot in a single simulation gazebo / Ros

I found no .cpp file or .h. I've tried every way but can not find how to make a smooth and efficient way to each turtlebot own your odometer.
I have lost months trying to edit the xml / launch in several ways but in the end do not get anywhere. And I see that is a very common question.
Please be clear. If not understood my question is: How do I run and control more than one Turtlebot in a single simulation gazebo / Ros.
(Ros hydro)

A:

I'm not sure what the real solution is (such that gazebo will directly publish odometry and tf for multiple robots), but I put together a hacky solution which was usable for me. Check out the two launch files in rosh_turtlebot_demo for how to startup gazebo and spawn two robots, and publish_odom.py for publishing odometry and tf.
The key is subscribing to gazebo/model_states and republishing the odom/tf data.

Perfect, really was that I needed. I made some changes to be able to work with my project. Thank you very much.
PS: I will not need it but at some script "r = Rand ()" (I think that's it) is returning error.
Solved!
