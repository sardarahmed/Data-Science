Q:

Switching from Gazebo to a "real" robot

Hey guys,
so far i have been using gazebo to simulate my algorithms (and then simulating the results in Gazebo), but now i have a real robot available and i wanted to know how i can load the urdf model (so i can see it in "rviz" and profit of the links to "tf ") without using the spawn robot launch file:
<node name="robot_spawner" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="$(optenv ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE) -unpause -urdf -param robot_description -model mobile_base"/> 

of gazebo_ros (because this launch script also launches gazebo).
Any suggestion would be very appreciated
Marcus

A:

That launch command assumes that the urdf has been written to the parameter robot_description. In Rviz, add a RobotModel to the displays with the topic robot_description (should be the default).
