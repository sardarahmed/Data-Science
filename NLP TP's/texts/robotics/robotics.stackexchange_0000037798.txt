Q:

An up to date version of the rflex / b21 stack

This is not a question. I have spent some time today fixing the issues of the atrvjr_node I have based on the b21_node (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rflex). The issue was with the wrong odometry output. And then I found that there is a newer version of the stack with some fixes. The newer stack can be cloned:
git clone http://code.in.tum.de/git/rwib21.git

Do you want to merge them with the current rflex stack?
Comment by mmedvede on 2012-06-06:
David, merging following changes would improve the rflex driver and b21 node:

A:

Updated rflex driver package that includes atrvjr node is here: http://www.cs.uml.edu/~mmedvede/files/rflex.tar.gz
The only tested capability is motor control. Sonars and other features have not been tested for atrvjr. The package has some patches from the repository I have referenced in the question.
