Q:

Where can I get .world files for stage?

Is there any repository where I can get them? I would like to simulate in different maps.
Thanks,

@jlo : tinker with the codes in willow-erratic.world and willow-four-erratic.world and try changing the pgm file with other sketches.

A:

You can find 4 world files that I used for my simulations, here :
http://mobotica.googlecode.com/files/stage-controllers.tar.gz
http://mobotica.googlecode.com/files/volksbot.tar.gz
http://mobotica.googlecode.com/files/simple-standalone.tar.gz
Plus, there is a Stage based turtlebot simulator,
