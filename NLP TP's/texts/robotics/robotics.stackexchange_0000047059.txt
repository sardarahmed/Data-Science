Q:

Autonomous navigation and avoiding obstacles

Sorry I am new to ROS.
May I ask, is there any navigation stack (for Turtlebot) that allows the robot to reach the goal location (in a known map) and go round some new, small obstacles on-the-way (not shown in the map). Do I need to add some user code in an existing stack?
Thank you very much.

Hi Chik, did you finish your project. I'm trying to do exactly same. can you help me? I have pioneer 3D-X mobile robot with odometer and laser. Please help me.

A:

Hi Chik,
Have you checked out the navigation stack?
There you have all the information needed to get your robot navigating autonomously in no time.
This stack includes path planners that will allow your robot to navigate a known map while avoiding unknown obstacles.
For the case of turtlebot you can check out turtlebot_navigation stack
Have fun!

I watched the movie in navigation stack. This is cool! Does Turtlebot give the same navigation performance as PR2 ?

Well, PR2 is far more complex than Turtlebot and equipped with more sensors for navigation than just a Kinect. Which makes PR2 navigation "better" than turtlebot's, but the performance of turtlebot is good enough for hobbyists and even research

@Martin Peris
i want my turtlebot search for an object in the room without determine the place of the goal in rviz ,,, I mean that Can i ask turtlebot for a Juice and it can autonomusly search the room by my 2D map  to get the Juice ?
