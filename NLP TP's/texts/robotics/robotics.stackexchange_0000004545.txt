Q:

How to control an Arduino Board with wireless PS3 controler?

I'm currently building a hexapod bot, composed with an Arduino Mega board and an USB SSC-32 (from Lynxmotion).
But now I want add a PS3 wireless controller to move my hexapod, I have made some search but nothing realy interesting. Maybe the Servoshock module but it seems works only with the ServoshockShield, a kind of Arduino card with Servo output. 

Can I use the ServoShock module alone ? 
Can I connect it with Rx/Tx port of the Arduino Mega board ?
Do you have other solution for me ? Board with documentation and sources codes ?

Thank you all

A:

If you want to do this on your own, you need additional hardware:

A arduino with an USB-Host (Mega will not work) or an shield which provides the USB-Host
A Bluetooth dongle

On your Arduino you will have to run the PS3BT
You have to know the MAC adress of your BT-dongle. This can be obtained in two ways:

Most simple: It is written on the dongle itself
Or you have to run the script and the MAC should be displayed over SerialMonitor

If you have the address then you have to comment the line 19 in the code and uncomment line 20. Additionally you have to enter your MAC address in the line 20.
Then unplug the dongle from the arduino, plug in the PS3 controller via USB and reset the arduino. The controller will be paired with the dongle.
Now plug in the dongle again and pair the controller (pressing the playstation button). It should work from here on. The script just prints the inputs from the controller to the serial monitor. Then you just have to implement all the rest of your code.
