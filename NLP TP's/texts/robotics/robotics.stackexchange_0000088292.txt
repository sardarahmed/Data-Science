Q:

Where does turtlebot3_core define odom and base_footprint names?

Hello! I am attempting to run slam gmapping for 2 robots. I am having a problem where the transform trees are conjoining instead of there being 2 separate trees.  I have already included namespaces and tf_prefixes in all of the launch files. odom and base_footprint are both generated after launching turtlebot3_core, and I cannot for the life of me find where these names are defined. Where can I change the names of these generated tf nodes? Or is there another way I can manage this?

@Darby Lim instead of only providing links to the resources, can you please update your question with a copy and paste of some minimal example? If and when these links disappear (which happens often) then your answer will lose its value and won't be self-contained.
