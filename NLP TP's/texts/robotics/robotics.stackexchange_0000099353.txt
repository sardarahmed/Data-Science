Q:

Attribute error: type object 'type' has no attribute '_TYPE_SUPPORT'

This is the main portion of the error I am getting,
AttributeError: type object 'type' has no attribute '_TYPE_SUPPORT' This might be a ROS 1 message type but it should be a ROS 2 message type. Make sure to source your ROS 2 workspace after your ROS 1 workspace.

Here is my full traceback,
Traceback (most recent call last):

I don't have ROS1 installed on this machine at all so I do not know why It may be suggesting that that is the issue.

A:

I will be adding this answer here for anyone who has this issue in the future...
It seems that colcon/ros didn't like the name I had used for my .srv file (WhereGo) and I rebased it to GetDestination and it all magically fixed itself it seems.

I had a similar error with an action client. My (unthinking) mistake was in passing the action type as its name rather than the type (i.e., cli = ActionClient(node, 'example/action/Fibonacci', 'fibonacci') when it should have been cli = ActionClient(node, Fibonacci, 'fibonacci')).

Same... I renamed my srv file to 'Oec.srv' from 'OddEvenCheck,srv' and ros ran its abraCaDabra.... weird....
