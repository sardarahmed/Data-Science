Q:

"rosmake teleop_base" couldn't find dependency [joy] of [teleop_base]

Hi,
I am using diamondback-full-desktop ROS version on Ubuntu 10.10. I was trying to run this command
$rosmake teleop_base
and it says that [rospack] couldn't find dependency [joy] of [teleop_base].
Is not [joy] a part of diamondback-full-desktop or do I need to install it separately? [I have control_toolbox -which is one dependency of teleop_base]
Thanks
VN

A:

joy is part of the joystick_drivers stack. I don't think it's part of the ros-diamondback-desktop-full metapackage.
You can install it from binaries using
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-joystick-drivers
