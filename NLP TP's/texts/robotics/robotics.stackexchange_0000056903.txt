Have you execute 'source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash' ?

A:

Because roscd has to change the working directory of the shell, it is implemented as a bash function and not as a script. This means that you will not find it on your path.
You can add roscd to your shell environment by installing rosbash and then sourcing the setup.bash for your distribution (/opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash for Hydro).
