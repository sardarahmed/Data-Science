Q:

Setting machine-dependent args in launch files?

Is there any way to set arguments in launch files as a function of machine name/HOSTNAME?
Specifically, I would like to run the same launch file on multiple machines, but with 1 of the args changing based on machine name. I am aware there are (currently) no arg comparators in roslaunch (only if/unless statements), and have investigated the  tag, but was not successful in getting this to work.
Thanks ahead

A:

You can read environment variables from a launch file using $(env VAR). You could use this to read the HOSTNAME variable if that is useful, or you could set a custom environment variable on a per-host basis and use that.
A more complete example would be:
<arg name="host" value="$(env HOSTNAME)"/>

Was hoping to avoid that and have everything included in .launch files, but agreed that works.

There are clever ways to use includes, if you have unique hostnames. For example <include file="$(find my_package)/hosts/$(arg host).launch"/>
