Q:

Problem with roscore

Hello. I have problem with roscore. When I try to run roscore I give this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/init.py", line 230, in main
write_pid_file(options.pid_fn, options.core, options.port)
File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/init.py", line 106, in write_pid_file
with open(pid_fn, "w") as f:
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/user/.ros/roscore-11311.pid'
Does someone know how I can fix it ?

If you have source /root/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash in your .bashrc remove it, create the catkin workspace again and check.

It still doesn't work. I deleted my existing workspace, source from .bashrc and create new ones still appears this error. Maybe someone else know how fix this problem. I reinstall whole ROS and still nothing. I'm begginer in ROS.

Something is setup wrong. You can't write to the .ros directory or that specific file. What do you get for id -a, ls -la .ros?

A:

Hey guys,
the problem could be that you ran rosdep update with sudo rights. That leads to permission errors later on.
NOTE : Run rosdep update NOT with sudo.
SOLUTION to fix this run sudo rosdep fix-permissions
and after that rosdep update.
Worked for me.
cheers
Timo

Perfect it does the trick for me. I was running programs from 'ROS by Example for Hydro - Volume 1'. I was not able to execute
$ roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_turtlebot.launch
or
$ roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_pi_robot.launch
I would get 'IOERROR [Error13] ...'. Anyhow it is fixed now. Thanks!
