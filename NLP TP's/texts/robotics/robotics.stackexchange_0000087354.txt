Q:

Unable to load a custom controller

I created a custom controller for my omni wheel drive and listed it in my yaml file. But when I tried to launch, Im getting the following error. Tried searching the forum but unable to find an answer that works.
[ERROR] [1528923166.098299551]: Could not load class omni_drive/OmniDrive: Failed to load library /home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib//libomni_drive.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Could not load library (Poco exception = /home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib//libomni_drive.so: undefined symbol: _ZN10omni_drive9OmniDrive8startingERKN3ros4TimeE)

A:

forgot to add the class reference in the front of start and stop methods. Use c++filt -n _ZN10omni_drive9OmniDrive8startingERKN3ros4TimeE. That solved the problem for me.
