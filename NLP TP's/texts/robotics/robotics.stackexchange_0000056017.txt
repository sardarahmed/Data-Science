Q:

Error when running the Turtlebot_bringup launch file

Hi,
I am trying to implement 2D slam on an old iRobot Create with a Kinect attached to it.
This is the procedure I am following -

I have the iRobot Create.

I install the ros-groovy-brown-driver to be able to connect to the Create.
I have also installed the turtlebot
ros package.

I start roscore. And then I run the
following command
rosrun irobot_create_2_1 driver.py cmd_vel:=turtlebot_node/cmd_vel
The Create plays that music.
I wish to run the turtlebot_teleop command, but before that I try to run the
following command
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

I get the following errors. Also, if I run the turtlebot_teleop command for keyboard, it gets executed without errors but pressing the keys don't move the bot at all.

Other point to be noted -
The USB port parameter had to be modified to ttyUSB1 instead of ttyUSB0. This was done using the following command -
rosparam set /brown/irobot_create_2_1/port /dev/ttyUSB1

I think this might be the issue because the parameter isn't set for turtlebot package. I don't know how to change it for the turtlebot package though.
Also, there I can't seem to find, turtlebot_driver anywhere. Shouldn't that have been installed along with the turtlebot package? Edit: I think it's now called create_driver. I have modified the create_driver.py to cahnge ttyUSB0 to ttyUSB1, but still the minimal.launch fails.
What needs to be done in this case?
Is there an alternative to using the turtlebot package to be able to run teleop?

A:

I found the issue.

When running the command for minimal.launch, there was some kind of clash between the irobot_create_2_1_driver and the create_driver (turtlebot_driver). When I ended irobot_create_2_1_driver command the minimal.launch worked. If anyone knows why this issue between the two please let me know.
The minimial.launch was giving trouble because of the  ttyUSB0 issue after this. Solutions for that are already available on answers.ros.org.

Right now, the turtlebot_teleop commands work.
