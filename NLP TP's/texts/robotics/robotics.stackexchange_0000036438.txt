Q:

rosjava - Compiling error

hi,
i have been trying to install rosjava by following documentation found on
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ApplicationsPlatform/Clients/Android.
in step 3 when asked to compile "rosmake android_app_chooser" i received an error. i downgraded like the next step suggests but i receive the following error.
 maven-install:
