Q:

OS X - Indigo - 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 install problems

I get this message after running 2.1.2 :
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved

When I try the next step 2.1.13 ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
I get this message:

I would appreciate any help.
Thanks!

A:

You issue is that the qt4 dependencies that ROS Indigo needs are no longer available. I removed them in this pull request because the Homebrew formula they mapped to were no longer available or supported:
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/14573

Unfortunately, I think ROS Indigo on macOS with Homebrew is a dead-end. Basically Homebrew has dropped support for Qt4 and despite trying to come up with all the dependencies they removed:
https://github.com/ros/homebrew-deps/pull/31
I failed to get that path to work out. At this point I think we're only going to be able to support a Qt5/Gazebo7/ROS Kinetic setup on macOS.
@mikepurvis basically came to the same conclusion:
