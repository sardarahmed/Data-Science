Q:

install perception pcl

Hellow,
I'm trying to install the package here perception_pcl to use the object recognition of pcl in ros Groovy. For now I have pcl installed in groovy (pcl 1.6) and I can't figure how to install this repo in my catkin workspace.
I tried cloning it and then catkin_make or cmake then make pcl then catkin_make while isolating the pcl folder but I have tons of dependency error then.
Can someone give me a "how to do it" explanation please ? There is no README so I'm lost ><
I tried follow this link as well but there is no cmake_find_ros anymore...
For example I just ran catkin_make after downloading the package and I have that kind of errors :
In file included from /home/ros/catkin_ws/src/perception_pcl-groovy-unstable-devel/pcl_ros/src/pcl_ros/features/feature.cpp:51:0:

Here is the output of dkpg -l |grep perception
ros@ros-K56CM:~$ dpkg -l |grep perception

Here are my includes in my program :
#include <pcl/recognition/cg/hough_3d.h>
#include <pcl/recognition/cg/geometric_consistency.h>

And here is the output of catkin_make :

I assume I don't have the library so I tried to install that github package.
Any help will be appreciated

Are you on Ubuntu? Have you tried installing perception-pcl from debs?

I'm on Ubuntu. I have perception-pcl install from the debs. But when I try to use pcl/recognition/Something.h there is no such file. I'm going to add some information to the question.

Can you add your package.xml and CMakeLists.txt?

A:

In the end I found a way to install on old version of Pcl1.7 trunk that one of my friend had. But thanks for your help !
