A:

Have you seen this link ? http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_teleop. You may be better off installing pr2_apps package (http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_apps). Just curious, which version of ROS are you using ?

@agrirobot-George Try sudo apt-get install ros-electric-pr2-apps, I would hope that works ! I am on Fuerte, so cannot confirm about Electric with certainity. ** UPDATE ** == > It works on Fuerte, should work just fine on Electric.

@agrirobot-George Have you set up your ROS repositories ? this may be some corruption, you may need to reset your ROS repositories. The repository and the package (pr2_apps) works fine !
