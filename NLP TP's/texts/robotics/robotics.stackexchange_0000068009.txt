Q:

Eclipse unresolved includes

Hey,
I'm trying to use Eclispe (Indigo) with ROS (Hydro). I can import my packages but I still have inresolved includes.
I followed the Turorial but I'm not able to do this step:

In Eclipse, right click the project,
click properties -> C/C++ general ->
Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros
etc. Click the tab "Providers" and
check the box next to "CDT GCC
Built-in Compiler Settings [ Shared
]".

When I click on porperties -> c/c++ general there is no Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros etc.
Is there any way to solve this problem in another way?

A:

Did you click on the small black triangle next to C/C++ General? If you clicked on just C/C++ General it should just say "Enable Project Specific Settings" which is not the option you want.
On Eclipse Luna, which is what I'm using, under C/C++ General it says: >Code analysis, Documentation, File Types, Formatter, Indexer, Language Mapping, Preprocessor Include Paths and Profiling Catagories.
If any of those are missing, you might want to consider using a more recent version of eclipse.
If adding CDT GCC Built-in Compiler Settings [ Shared ] doesn't fix your problem, make sure to check Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Include Paths and Symbols, and see if /usr/include/c++/4.x and /usr/include/c++/4.x/backward are in there. 4.x for me was 4.8. Check yours by using your file manager and going to /usr/include.
Remember to go to Project ->C/C++ Index after finishing.
It should be fixed by then, assuming you installed eclipse and ran it from terminal with bash -i -c "eclipse

Yes, I clicked on the triangle. For my version it only says Code Style, Documentation, File Types, Indexer and Language Mapping.
I also included these paths but its still not working.
But thanks for your answer, I will get a more recent version of eclipse!
