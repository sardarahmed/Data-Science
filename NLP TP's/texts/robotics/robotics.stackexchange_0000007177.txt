Q:

How to test GAZEBO works properly. Save windows don't show any component

How can I test whether my gazebo installation works properly or not? I'm trying to "save myworld" and "save as" options but no window is shown.

A:

"Save World as" is broken on Gazebo 5.1.0 . 
You can either install the experimental version of Gazebo 6 using the gazebo6-prerelease package (assuming you are on Ubuntu) or wait for the fix to be released in Gazebo 5.2.0 . 
The relevant bug on Gazebo issue tracker is:
