Q:

Reduce frame rate FPS kinect openni_launch

Hello everybody,
I am running two programs at the same time so the computational cost is too high. Hence, i thought in reducing the frame rate of the kinect. I am using openni_launch and fuerte. Does anyone know how to reduce the FPS or whether it is possible?
Thank you very much!
Antonio

A:

You can skip frames to reduce frame rate.
Write this line in the terminal
set param name="camera/driver/data_skip" value="10"
and then run
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
This will drop 10 frames and output 2-3Hz data, whereas default value is 0 (which output 30 frames/sec without any dropping)

I tried this and didn't work. Instead I used dynamic_reconfigure with the openni running. Here is the command I used: "$ rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam set /camera/driver data_skip 9"
