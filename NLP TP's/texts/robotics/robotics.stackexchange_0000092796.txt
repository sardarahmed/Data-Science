Q:

[ROS2] Is there a function to obtain message size of a ROS2 message in C++?

This could be useful when optimizing system performance.

By size, do you mean the size of a message once it it serialized?
Comment by ahtsan on 2019-07-31:
Yes, if that means the same as the throughput of a publisher if the publisher published that message.

Just want to confirm: Is it not possible at this stage? Will it be supported later?

A:

Currently there is no API to determine the wire size of a message. And it isn't planned to implement that feature.
