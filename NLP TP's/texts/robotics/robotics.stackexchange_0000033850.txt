Q:

Walltimer destroyed immediately after creation

Hi!  I've been using turtlebot software and things are generally working well for me, but I get a recurring warning often when I am running programs.  The warning is about a Walltimer that is destroyed immediately after creation.  I have not seen this warning in the tutorials I have been reading.  Also, I wonder why there is often a lot more text generated on my screen and the process seems to restart several times before working.  The output is below:

A:

I get the Walltimer message too, it seems to be a known issue. AFAICT it's benign, and probably not related to the other issues you're having (which from your description are not very clear -- I think you need to elaborate more on the restarting).
