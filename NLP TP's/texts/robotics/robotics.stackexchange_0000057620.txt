Q:

Creating a desktop shortcut for a specific roslaunch

Is it possible to create a graphical shortcut for a specific roslaunch file that can be run by a user without any terminal knowledge by double clicking on an icon?
I've tried to create a .desktop file, a .command file and a bash file but none of these seem to run the program and leave it running. The .desktop file seems to get closest but doesn't appear to respect the environment variables specified in my .bashrc file.
Thanks for any help

A:

"An icon" is quite unspecific as that highly depends on what Desktop you use.
The safest and portable thing for me seems to make a bash script that you call from whatever icon/launcher/etc.
This should work in general by just calling roslaunch. You might need to manually source your .bashrc within the script.
That should fix the problem that you observed.
