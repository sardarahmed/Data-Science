Q:

Why sound play doesn't use festival's default voice?

Hi all,
I'm trying to make our pr2 speak. However the (sound_play node + say.py script) gives a deep and slow voice hardly understandable. I changed voices in festival, but sound_play doesn't take it into account.
How to make sound_play use the voice set as default in festival ?

Hi Guido,
I submitted a ticket for the "deep slow voice" issue about 6 weeks ago.  In the meantime, the only way I figured out how to change the voice is as follows.  (This applies to Ubuntu 10.04 with Diamondback debian packages and Festival debian packages.)
$ cd /usr/share/festival
<br>
$ sudo pico voices.scm
(Or use whatever editor you like instead of pico.)
Once in the editor, search for "kal_diphone" (without the quotes).  Change this to "don_diphone" (again without the quotes).
Save changes and exit the editor.
You should now hear a better voice when using sound_play node + say.py.

Thanks for the answer. Sadly, it doesn't changed the voice. I changed "kal_diphone" to "voice_cmu_us_bdl_arctic_clunits" but it didn't worked. I tryed with don_diphone without success. I still get a ugly voice.
