A:

The map_server package can probably help : http://wiki.ros.org/map_server
Write a .yaml file as specified on the wiki page and try to run rosrun map_server map_server mymap.yaml
Edit: You have a typo in your yaml : the first line needs an additional space :
image: map.png instead of image:map.png. To prevent this kind of mistakes in the future, I suggest you look up how to enable syntax highlighting for yaml in your editor and/or use a yaml validator if you really have a doubt. But usually your yaml library will do most of the job.

Can you edit your post to add your procedure and the complete output of your commands ? You must explain what you have tried before people can help you.
