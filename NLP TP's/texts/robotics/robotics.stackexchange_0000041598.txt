Q:

Why rosmake failed only appear on some packages?

I followed swri-ros-pkg
I download by
  svn checkout http://swri-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ swri-ros-pkg-read-only

Why only motoman stack  failed to rosmake, but all others stack and packages are able to rosmake.
  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only/motoman$ pwd
  /home/ira/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only/motoman

  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only/motoman$       rosmake
  [ rosmake ] No package selected and the current directory is not the correct       path for package 'motoman'.
  [ rosmake ] Packages requested are: []

  [ rosmake ] Expanded args [] to:

  [ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack       names.
  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only/motoman$

How to solve it?
Thank you~

Here is the directory of motoman:
  ira@ira-K42JP:~$ rospack find motoman
  /home/ira/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only/freetail/industrial/motoman
  ira@ira-K42JP:~$ 

Here is my path:
  ira@ira-K42JP:~$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
  /home/ira/code/ros:/opt/ros/electric/stacks
  ira@ira-K42JP:~$

A:

The error says that you didn't put your package in the ros package path. Check out this answer for more information on a clean way to set up source repositories.
Edit: You seem to have several versions of motoman. The result of rospack find motoman is different from your current path.
/home/ira/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only/freetail/industrial/motoman

from rospack vs.
/home/ira/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only/motoman

as your current directory.
I'm not sure how motoman got into the subdirectory freetail/industrial because it is not in the svn repository you checked out. I would get rid of it or delete the complete check-out directory, i.e. /home/ira/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only and check out a new, clean version.

I'm sure I have put. Because I can rosmake other packages or stacks on /media/Data/code/ros/sam_industrial/swri-ros-pkg-read-only.  On that directory, only small part of stack and package I can't rosmake. My ros package path had already added to /media/Data/code/ros
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-06-21:
I still believe that something must be wrong with your ros configuration. Try calling rosmake SIA20D_Mesh_arm_navigation in your home directory please. I guess it will say something like it cannot find the package.
Comment by tfoote on 2012-06-26:
What is the output of 'rospack find SIA20D_Mesh_arm_navigation'? Does it point to the current directory?
Comment by sam on 2012-06-29:
I found that rosmake SIA20D_Mesh_arm_navigation successfully,although I don't understand why. And motoman stack still do not work. I have revised my original post.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-07-01:
What's the output of rospack find motoman and what's the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
Comment by sam on 2012-07-03:
I have edited the original post for these two output.

The trunk was recently broken by a bad check in. It looks like that may be your problem. I recommend working on the fuerte or electric branches. They should be stable.  Sorry. The trunk should be fixed soon.
