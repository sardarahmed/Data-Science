Q:

Unable to locate package ros

Firing up an old netbook (1.6 GHz 2 core Acer, 1 gig memory running Ubuntu 12.04) and find that it has ros-fuerte on it. I wish to remove/uninstall this. I tried sudo apt-get remove ros but I get E: Unable to locate package ros
any ideas? I know its there, locate shows all the files, the workspace is in the home folder, update manager is trying to update files, etc.
regards, Richard

A:

That error msg from apt means there's no debian package with the name 'ros'. In your case if you want to remove all ROS fuerte related packages, run:
$ sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-*
