Q:

No CMakeLists.txt in ROS Fuerte install

I'm in the process of installing ROS on my iMac running Mountain Lion, and I'm having issues with cmake.
When I run this:
cmake .. -DMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF
I get this: CMake Error: The source directory "/Users/NickSweet/ros-underlay" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
Everything went fine with rosinstall, except it wasn't able to get actionlib – but I doubt that's the issue. Any idea why I don't have a CMakeLists.txt in my ~/ros-underlay? Here's what I've got, in case anything else is missing:

What was the rosinstall command you were using? Did you add the --catkin parameter? It will create a top-level CMakeLists.

I used this:
rosinstall --catkin ~/ros-underlay http://ros.org/rosinstalls/fuerte-ros-full.rosinstall
Does that mean there's an issue with catkin, then?

A:

I found the problem!
ActionLib is actually hosted at https://github.com/ros-gbp/actionlib-release and no longer at it://github.com/wg-debs/actionlib-release.git – when it didn't install properly, gitinstall simply wouldn't create the CMakeLists.txt file.
The fix is to install ActionLib manually. Go into ~/ros-underlay and use
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ros-gbp/actionlib-release.git /Users/YOURUSERNAME/ros-underlay/actionlib

Then run
rosinstall --catkin ~/ros-underlay http://ros.org/rosinstalls/fuerte-ros-full.rosinstall

And hit skip when the install asks whether you want to replace actionlib. Problem solved!
