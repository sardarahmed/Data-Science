Q:

ueye undefined reference using catkin_make

I stumbled upon a difficulty, when trying to work with uEye camera. I've added
include "ueye.h"
to work with code:
HIDS hCam = 1;

INT nRet = is_InitCamera (&hCam, NULL);

Yet this is the output when I try to do catkin_make using my CMakeLists (http://pastebin.com/u8f4t2Fc)
CMakeFiles/ros_aruco.dir/src/ros_aruco.cpp.o: In function `main':
ros_aruco.cpp:(.text+0x578): undefined reference to `is_InitCamera'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

What should I add to make it work?

Ding dong! Correct answer. Many thanks!

A:

add ${UEYE_LIBRARY} to the target_link_libraries for ros_aruco?
