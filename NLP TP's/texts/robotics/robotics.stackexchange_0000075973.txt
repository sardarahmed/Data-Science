Q:

Navigation stack should use which node map_server or map_saver

In navigation stack I am using a launch file. In that launch file map_server package is launching map_server node.
For creating map I am using gmapping package. In Gmapping I am using map_saver node from map_server package to save a map. I am in confusion that in Navigation stack which node of map_server package I should  use map_server or map_saver.
What is the difference between map_server and map_saver?

A:

map_saver saves a map generated by gmapping to a file on the computer.
You can then use the map_server package for publishing this saved map for localization.
So in short map_saver saves a generated map, and map_server uses the saved map.
