Q:

catkin - Run CMake only

Is there a simple method to invoke catkin so that it only configures CMake, but does not invoke make?
Right now my current solution is to have make do a dry-run:
catkin_make --make-args -n

However, this occasionally results in errors. (Will post them next time I run into them)

A:

After invoking catkin_init_workspace (which creates a toplevel CMakeLists.txt file) you can just use standard cmake.

Ah, thanks! To make sure I have it right, you would just to catkin_ws/build/ and invoke cmake ../src/CMakeLists.txt?
