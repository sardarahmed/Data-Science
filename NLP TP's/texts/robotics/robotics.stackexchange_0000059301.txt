Q:

How to get topic message by time (similar to tf)?

Hi,
I want to be able to get a topic message by its time(stamp).
tf provides similar functunality for transformations, but is there any implementation for other topics?
For example I want to get the message on topic '/foo' that arrived 2 seconds ago.
Thanks, xaedes

A:

A message filter cache should be able to do that:
