Q:

Driver for SoftKinetic DS325 / DS311

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a ROS driver for the SoftKinetic DS325 or DS311 3D sensors?
They do have Linux support (basic driver only), so I'm just trying make sure I don't start working on something that already exists.

A:

Edit (2014-06-10): it would seem a driver is available in the ipa320/softkinetic Github repository now. I haven't used it myself, but it seems to be at least publishing sensor_msgs::Image and sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 messages.
