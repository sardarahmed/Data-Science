Q:

What kind of control system does move_base have?

So I'm trying to wrap my head around which node exactly does the control system for moving a specific distance in the Navigation stack (using current velocity from /cmd_vel). I came to the conclusion that move_base is responsible for this, but now I'm wondering: what kind of control system does it implement? How does it know what cmd_vel to publish in order to reach the specific distance it must go? Is it a PID controller or something?
I'm mostly asking this just to make sure that I understand this right... I basically want to make sure that my robot moves to the designated destination in a controlled manner (not just full speed until it reaches target then stops and overshoots)...

Which planner are you using and what ROS version?

I haven't started working on the Navigation stack, because I need to first figure out my base_controller (and I need to find out what it should expect from Navigation). Basically, does Navigation take care of going from one point to another in a controlled manner (without overshoot)?

A:

The local planner is the controller, taking in the global plan and outputting the cmd_vel. Specifically, the low level control (at least for the DWA planner) is handled here: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/hydro-devel/base_local_planner/src/latched_stop_rotate_controller.cpp

thank you for your reply. Do you have any idea where I can learn more about the latched_stop_rotate_controller and what to expect of it? Should I basically not worry about implementing a control system (for reaching goals) in my base_controller?

I noticed I can find more about it here http://wiki.ros.org/base_local_planner#LatchedStopRotateController . I will attempt to do the Navigation tutorials for now. Thanks again!
