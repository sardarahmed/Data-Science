Q:

amcl basic localization

Dear all.
I am having problems to localize the robot using the topics from amcl
amcl_pose (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped)
tf (tf/tfMessage)
Can anyone advise me how to do it.
In advance thank you

A:

You don't need to deal directly with TF topic... Just define point (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped, with x/y/z equal to zero) in robot coordinate system (frame_id="/base_link") and transform it to map coordinate system ("/map"). Then you will get robot position/orientation in map. If you don't know how to transform point, please read some TF tutorials.

Hi, thank you for your answer :) it looks good :), Actually I got the position from amcl_pose topic  but I will try the way you suggest. Cheers

Yeah, it's much better to use described TF-based method because it doesn't depend on some specific topic. It will work also with different localization code which provides transformation between map and robot (like gmapping etc).
