Q:

How to add a floor to the world?

I have a small robot which I want to spawn it on a ramp that I have created. Everytime I spawn it there, due to the inertia the robot rolls down the ramp and then falls down into the emptness where ramp is present. So i wanted to firwst launch a ground_plane on which later I want to launch a ramp, so that even if robot rolls down the ramp, it doesnt fall down into emptyness. Can anyone please help me how to do that ?
I have tried using two include statements one for each model and yet only the first include statement is being considered while launching. I am launching it using roslaunch.

You can add the ground model into your world
<sdf version="1.4"> 
  <world name="world"> 
      <include> 
          <uri>model://ground_plane</uri> 
      </include> 
      <include> 
          <uri>model://sun</uri> 
      </include>
  </world> 
</sdf>
