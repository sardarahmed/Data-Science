Q:

arm_navigation - cylindrical links don't avoid collision

Hi!
I'm following the arm_navigation tutorials and I went through the planning description configuration wizard successfully. However, when trying 'Planning Components Visualizer', I couldn't get my custom robot to avoid a pole, it would always go through it as if it wasn't there.
All links of my robot were defined as cylinders in the urdf file, but when I converted them to boxes, the robot started avoiding the pole successfully.
Is this supposed to be like this, or is it a bug (or my problem maybe)?
Thanks in advance!

Maybe you only added visual, but not collision? According to your description it doesn't seem so and it might be a bug that should be filed.

I added both. Visual can be a cylinder, as long as collision is a box.

A:

I remember running into this problem as well. ODE, which is used by arm navigation for collision checking, does not support native cylinder-cylinder collision checks. This is known and should result in an error. I think there may even be a bug when checking collisions between other shapes and cylinders.
I don't think it will be fixed though, but the planned replacement MoveIT will use FCL for collision checks. It should work better there.

I confirm this is a bug though I can't find the ticket at the moment. Recommended hack is to make a mesh of a cylinder.
