Q:

Publishing from Octomap_server

Hi everyone can I publish a 2d projection of the map (occupancy_grid msg) that I loaded on the octomap_server and pass it to map_server or costmap_2d on some topic?
Can you help me?
Thanks

A:

The octomap_server already does this for you on the projected_map topic.

Ok! So if I publish a map on octomap_server this map will be also automatically passed to costmap_2d?!
Can you help me telling me what have I to write to read a costmap2dRos object from a costmap_2d node while i'm in a new Ros-node created by me?
Thanks a lot for all the answers

It's there to be used, but published on projected_map instead of map to avoid conflicts with another map server running. If you want to used this as the map topic remap projected_map:=map when starting octomap_server. For follow-up questions, please open a new one.
