Q:

How do I determine the cartesian coordinates of the end effector if I know the joint angles?

I have the SRDF file which gives the joint angles of the robot for the different poses (using Moveit).
Now in order to do a pick and place task, I need to give the cartesian coordinates of the object in the frame of the robot. So, I moved my robot using Moveit to a position such that the end effector can grasp the object, so that I have the joint angles of the robot for performing the grasp. But, I need the position of the end effector with respect to the robot, when the robot is in that position. How do I determine that?

A:

The easiest way is to use tf_echo:
rosrun tf tf_echo <your_base_link> <your_gripper_frame>
