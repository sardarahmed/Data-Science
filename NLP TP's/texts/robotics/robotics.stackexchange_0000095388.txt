Q:

Show basic URDF model in Rviz2

I'm trying to follow the URDF tutorial on ROS2. To begin I've launched Rviz2 like this:
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2

But I'm not able to see my model.

I've selected the Description File to be my .urdf model, which I'm adding below.

I've selected the "Fixed Frame" to be "base_link" and that solves an error, but is not enough to see the model.

This configuration can be seen here: https://imgur.com/a/J9uHVVq
I'm also getting a warning that says "No tf data. Actual Error: Frame [base_link] does not exist."
What am I missing?
My  system is:

Linux Desktop 5.3.0-46-generic #38~18.04.1-Ubuntu
