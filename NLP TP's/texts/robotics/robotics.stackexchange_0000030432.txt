Q:

rosdep: trouble installing packages in Diamondback (prosilica_camera)

I recently installed Diamondback using the standard install method for Ubuntu (Lucid)
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full

I have a couple of Prosilica cameras that I want to test so I'm following the tutorials (http://www.ros.org/wiki/prosilica_camera/Tutorials/DeterminingProsilicaIPAddress). I can't get past the first step of
rosdep install prosilica_camera

I get a message back saying
Warning: could not identify ['prosilica_camera'] as a package

I get the same response when I try to use rosdep to install camera_drivers, camera1394, and prosilica_gige_sdk. However, when I try to install rviz, move_base, and other packages that are already installed, I get the response
rosdep executing this script:
{{{
set -o errexit
#No Packages to install
}}}

Is anyone else having trouble using rosdep to install new packages? Any suggestions on what I should try next? Thanks,
Thomas

A:

I'm answering my own question. I did not search for the correct terms on this site apparently. I found joq's answer here (http://answers.ros.org/question/169/how-do-i-install-a-missing-ros-package) and that did the trick. I was able to run prosilica nodes after installing with
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-camera-drivers
