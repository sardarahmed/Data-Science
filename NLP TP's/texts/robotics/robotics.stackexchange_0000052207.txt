Q:

rosseria_arduino ros_lib permission denied

Hello, I'm new in ROS and I'm trying to setup rosserial arduino following the steps of the tutorial:
    cd <ws>/src
    git clone https://github[dot]com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
   `cd <ws>`
  catkin_make
  catkin_make install
  source <ws>/install/setup.bash

    cd <sketchbook>/libraries
  rm -rf ros_lib
  rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .

but when I enter the last command I get this error message:
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/jaime/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib'

I need to know what to do in this case.
Thank you very much!
Apparently is about a permission to make a folder into the ~/sketchbook/libraries folderbecause I can run the same last code outside that folder and it works.
Thanks

A:

This isn't really a ROS issue - as the error message says, it's an issue with the permissions in that directory. See if reading this tutorial on Linux file permissions helps, and then check out "man chmod".

This actually solve the problem! I just insert a command to give me the permissions to write, read and execute the ~/sketchbook/libraries folder, it went like this: sudo chmod 777 ~/sketchbook/libraries. Thanks!
