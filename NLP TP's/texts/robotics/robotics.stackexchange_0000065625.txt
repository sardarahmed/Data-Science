Q:

rosdep all packages

I've recently been working with some experimental packages created for ROS and amd compiling these from source. Quite a few of these packages seem to have dependencies, so naturally I have been using the rosdep install [package] command. However, this seems a bit tedious given the amount of packages in the workspace.
I was wondering if there was a quicker way to do this or is this the standard way? - Something along this lines of install all dependencies for packages within a specific folder or similar.

Try:
rosdep --help

  --from-paths          Affects the 'check', 'keys', and 'install' verbs. If
                        specified the arugments to those verbs will be

                        packages found there in.

Thanks! I was trying to get to this same set of instructions by just typing rosdep but it was giving me the commands instead of the arguments obviously. facepalm

Oh, I see. Yeah, it's strange that when run without any arguments, rosdep only prints half the help page.
