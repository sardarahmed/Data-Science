Q:

Problems with CloudSim 1.4.0 / AWS

I successfully launched CloudSim 1.4.0 on us-east-1a but when I attempt to launch a constellation i get the following error:

I have already requested to be allowed 12 GPU instances from Amazon as stated in this tutorial.  I got an email stating my request had been completed and closed, so I assume that I have the instances I ask for, but I still get this error. I have requested the allowance again just in case, but is there a chance this is an issue with CloudSim and not Amazon? Any idea what I should do?

A:

The problem ended up being amazon's. I requested EC2 instances again, and it worked after they responded again.
