Q:

Blue Skies in Gazebo 1.9

I've successfully gotten the Gazebo 1.9/ROS Hydro to work on multiple computers (on both Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 12.10), but when the Gazebo simulator pops up, the sky is just a light gray. I see in the screenshot that it's supposed to be blue with clouds - any idea what I'm missing in my installation?
Thanks

Hi,
your is not the problem. The sky is just optional and has to be enabled explicitly.
gazebo world files can contain a scene/sky block like:
<scene>
  <sky>
    <clouds>
      <speed>12</speed>
    </clouds>
  </sky>
</scene>

This enables SkyX...(taken from empty_sky.world example)
have a look at the corresponding SDF regions for more information
sdf1.5 sky

Cool!  Thanks for this answer!  Is there a way to make the sky red instead of blue?  I played with the color values inside the scene tag and I could get the ground to turn red, but the sky remained blue.  Changing the ambient values inside the cloud tag didn't seem to have any effect.  I'm using Gazebo 1.9.

There currently isn't a hook to change the sky color and still have clouds. Please submit an issue to have this feature added to Gazebo.

Done.  Thanks.  Is there a way today in Gazebo 1.9 to change the sky color without clouds?  Just wondering due to the wording in your comment above.

You could try the  SDF tag.

I'm having trouble with the sdf1.4 sky link in your answer above. Has this URL moved?  Also, If I wanted to paint a real sun in the sky, where in the code should I start?  Thanks!

Hi, the URL moved... sdf specification can now be found under www.sdformat.org
I updated the url...
