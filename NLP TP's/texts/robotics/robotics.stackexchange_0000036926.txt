Q:

boost path when cross compiling

When cross-compiling for the Nao in http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao/Tutorials/Cross-Compiling should the boost path be set to the system's boost directory (i.e. /usr) or to some directory local to the location of the cross-compilation (i.e. /media/external/ros/electric/ros...)?  If the latter, where should I be setting the path?

A:

Alternatively, you could set the ROS_BOOST_ROOT and ROS_BOOST_VERSION environment variables:
// for naoqi 1.10.xx
export ROS_BOOST_ROOT="${CTC_DIR}/staging/geode-linux/usr"    
export ROS_BOOST_VERSION="1.38.0"

// for naoqi 1.12
export ROS_BOOST_ROOT="${CTC_DIR}/sysroot/usr"
export ROS_BOOST_VERSION="1.45.0"

Make sure that the version variable matches the boost library version in your cross-compilation toolchain and that
rosboost-cfg --lib_dir

actually returns the correct directory containing the boost libraries.
