Q:

Plugin doesnt appear among controller types

At the bottom of my .cpp file I have
// make the controller available to the library loader
PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS(hiqp::ROSKinematicsController, controller_interface::ControllerBase)

but when I run
rosservice call /controller_manager/list_controller_types

the ROSKinematicsController does not appear.
Shall this be sufficient for loading a controller as a plugin, or have I forgotten something?

A:

Hi neckutrek,
Did you also provide a Plugin File Description and register it with the ROS package system?
If you carefully follow all the steps as described on the pluginlib wiki, it should work.
