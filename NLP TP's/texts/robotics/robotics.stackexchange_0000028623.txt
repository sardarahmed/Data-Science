Q:

Set linear velocity on a link of an object using Gazebo messages/topic

Is there any way to set linear velocity , collision on a link of an object using messages like Wrench.
That is, publishing on default topics with standalone C++.

A:

I know the question is about a transport API, but I'll just point out this tutorial on several ways of doing it via the C++ API.

There's no transport API for link velocity, but there are for:
Link force
Publish a wrench message to ~/<model_name>/<link_name>/wrench, see an example here.
Joint position / velocity / force
Publish a joint cmd message to ~/<model_name>/joint_cmd, see an example here.
