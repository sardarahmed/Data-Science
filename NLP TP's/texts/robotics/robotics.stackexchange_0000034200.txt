Q:

rosjava: Couldn't find executable named run.py

I'm trying to run a java program but I have this error:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named run.py below /opt/ros/electric/stacks/rosjava_core/rosjava_bootstrap
As I see I couldn't found run.py. But I just installed the rosjava from the repository for electric.
What can be happening? Where must be the run.py script?
Thank you

A:

The rosjava API is still in flux.  The run.py executable has not been released into the debian version; instead you have to install rosjava from source:
hg clone https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg rosjava_core
