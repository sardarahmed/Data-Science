Q:

What is the default noise parameters in sensor inputs in robot_localization?

In my yaml parameter file I have not specified any initial noise or process noise for my two sensors. What default noise values will the extended Kalman filter use on these inputs? I have tried to find the default values in the documentation http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html and the source code https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization without success.
In the documentation it states: Missing covariances. If you have configured a given sensor to fuse a given variable into the state estimation node, then the variance for that value (i.e., the covariance matrix value at position (i,i), where i is the index of that variable) should not be 0. If a 0 variance value is encountered for a variable that is being fused, the state estimation nodes will add a small epsilon value (1e−6) to that value. A better solution is for users to set covariances appropriately.
Does this mean that all the noise is set to a small epsilon value (1e−6)? And does this apply for both process and initial noise? Or does it mean that if a value is set to 0 a small epsilon value (1e−6) will be added to that 0?

A:

If the variance in the covariance matrix for a measurement is smaller than 1e-9 it will set it to 1e-9.
In the source code
Also regarding the process noise this is the default values:

So If I am not defined them it the yaml file I will get the values above?

That is correct.
