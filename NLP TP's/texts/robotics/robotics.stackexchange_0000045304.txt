Q:

MobileSim text display not working‚Äè

Hi,
I am using MobileSim 0.5.0 (mobilesim_0.5.0_i386.deb) on Ubuntu 11.10 x86. I have installed these extra packages:
libwxgtk2.6-0
libgtk2.0
python-wxgtk2.6

I am using ROS electric and the RosAria Stack. When starting MobileSim (MobileSim -r amigo) I get these warnings:
(MobileSim:9124): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_colormap_alloc_colors: assertion `GDK_IS_COLORMAP (colormap)' failed

 Warning: Could not load any font. Text display may not work.

MobileSim then shows a window whith the robot, but not menu or text. Please see image for how it looks exactly.
Thanks for any help.

THis doesn't appear to be ROS-related. That mobilesim deb appears to be provided by http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/MobileSim . Does it work fine on the same machine if you uninstall ROS?

Omg its a users fault :-). Ubuntu Unity or whats it called, shows the dropdownmenu integrated into the header if the window is maximized. Arg. Please consider this thread as closed.
