Q:

What kind of motors do industrial robot have?

What kind of motors do industrial robots use and how do you control them?

A:

Most industrial robot have servo motors. This allows you to control velocity, torque and position of motors - the latter usually in some form of closed-loop control system.
I work for St√§ubli. Our early robots were actually hydraulic, the UniMate. Next were the PUMA robots which had DC servo motors. The modern RX, TX, TX2, TS, and TS2 arms have 3-phase AC servo motors.
