Q:

writing your own local planner? Template?

Hi all
I want to write my own local planner to used with the navigation stack.
I already have written my code; what is left is to modify it so it could be used with the navigation stack.  I am wondering, is there a template or any guidance for writing your own local planner?

A:

The template is the BaseLocalPlanner interface class. You'll need to make that into a plugin and that should be it.
