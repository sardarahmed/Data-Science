Q:

How to call remote ROS node on mobile robot through laptop using wifi?

I've recently tried to get the remote ROS node on a mobile robot through wifi. This is as below picture.

I've run roscore command on both laptop and mobile robot and when I run the roscore command, I get the following warning message on my laptop server:

WARNING: ROS_MASTER_URI [http://192.168.7.2:11311] host is not set to this machine

auto starting new master
process[master]: started with pid[2719]
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.7.2:11311/

setting /run_id to 4ef6c0f8-bfdf-11d3-a450-4e699f75a6e7
process[rosout-1]:started with pid[2732]
started core service[/rosout]

But, when I run rosparam list command on my laptop, I've got the following results:
root@duminda-laptop:~#rosparam list
/rosdistro
/roslaunch/uris/host_192_168_7_2_35078
/rosversion
/run_id
root@duminda-laptop:~#rosparam get /rosdistro
hydro
root@duminda-laptop:~#rosparam get /roslaunch/uris/host_192_168_7_2_35078
http://192.168.7.2:35078
root@duminda-laptop:~#rosparam get /run_id
4ef6c0f8-bfdf-11d3-a450-4e699f75a6e7

These results show that both laptop and mobile robot connected ok.

Is my setup to receiving the mobile robots data to my laptop is ok?
Why there is a warning message like above when starting the roscore?

A:

This is how I make changes to my robot according to the book "Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming"
configuring mobile robot as ROS master
#setting LAPTOP_IP as mobile robot's ip
export LAPTOP_IP=192.168.7.2

#setting ROS_IP variable as laptop's ip
export ROS_IP=$LAPTOP_IP

#setting ROS_MASTER_URI as mobile robot's_ip
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.7.2:11311

configuring laptop as ROS computing node
#setting LAPTOP_IP as laptop's ip
export LAPTOP_IP=192.168.7.1

#setting ROS_IP variable as laptop's ip
export ROS_IP=$LAPTOP_IP

#setting ROS_MASTER_URI as mobile robot's_ip
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.7.2:11311

Also I've first tried this with different ros versions,ROS groovy on mobile robot and ROS indigo on my laptop . So as a result of that there was an error occurred described as in my question and in this attempt I've tried this configuration in both laptop and in the mobile robot using same ROS indigo versions. Hope this will help to others. 
Update 2017.08.28
Finally I've experimented that it is ok with using two versions of ROS for this . Using ROS groovy for mobile robot and ROS indigo for our pc/laptop . The ROS master and ROS computing node ip configurations must be properly set as mentioned above in this answer.
