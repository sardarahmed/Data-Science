Q:

Is launch file similar to the threading/processing concept in Python?

I know the goal of the launch file is to start multiple nodes at the same time. The nodes inside the launch file can send/receive data through different topics. However, does that mean the launch file achieves the goal of the threading/processing method in python? How the nodes are executed inside the launch file?

A:

If they are nodes, then each one is an individual process. There will be as many processes as there are nodes.
If they are nodelets, then each is loaded into an existing nodelet manager process as a dynamic library providing a function to call. In this case there will only be one process per nodelet manager.
Here is the place in the roslaunch source relevant to starting node processes.
