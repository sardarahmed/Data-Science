Q:

very fast rotation

hi, all,
my robot is rotating very fast. it runs on move_base.
although I have capped the rotation as below in the local path planner and rotate recovery
TrajectoryPlannerROS:
  max_vel_x: 0.45
  min_vel_x: 0.05
  max_rotational_vel: 0.2
  min_in_place_rotational_vel: 0.01

  acc_lim_th: 0.2
  acc_lim_x: 0.5
  acc_lim_y: 0

RotateRecovery:
      max_rotational_vel: 0.2
      min_in_place_rotational_vel: 0.01
      acc_lim_th: 0.2

it still turns very fast.
especially when the robot set off from its original position.
the max rotational vel printed from cmd_vel topic is upto -1.0
the 0.2 cap seems only effective when robot reaches its destine and trying to adjust its final position.
other then the two rotational velocity about, is there any other place I should be concerning?
thanks
Ray

the nomenclature might be different as @ahendrix mentioned. But I have had similar problems from bringing down the velocities too much. I don't know what the problem source is but increasing the overall velocities and accelerations moderated that problem for me.

A:

You should probably also be setting the min_rotational_vel or min_vel_theta parameter to TrajectoryPlannerROS.
The other parameters to TrajectoryPlannerROS are described on the base_local_planner wiki page
