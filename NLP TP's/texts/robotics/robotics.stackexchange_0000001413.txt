Q:

Is a Raspberry Pi processor powerful enough for a mobile chatbot?

In general, is a Raspberry Pi processor powerful enough for a mobile chatbot? I want to make a small mobile robot that is like a chatbot. Is a Raspberry Pi processor powerful enough for any type of AI robotics?
As far as a mobile robot, I want to make a wheeled robot about one foot in every dimension. The chatbot abilities will be from ProgramPY-SH, a new chatbot program that uses Xaiml databases. The chatbot works by looking through a database for a match of the user's input (vocal or text-based). It then acts according to the instructions given by the XML-like database.

A:

Despite its price, the Raspberry Pi is a rather powerful platform that can run most Linux desktop applications but the most CPU/memory hungry. For example, Quake 3 has been shown to run in 1080p on it.
