Q:

Unmet dependencies because of arm-navigation-experimental

Hi, I was trying to install packages like object_manipulation.
But system reported that due to dependency problems, it's marked as broken package.
Does anyone also met this situation before?
Thanks for answering.

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

 ros-electric-object-manipulation : Depends: ros-electric-arm-navigation-experimental (= 0.4.10-s1332431219~maverick) but 0.4.10-s1332436221~maverick is to be installed
E: Broken packages

A:

I think i had the same problem some weeks ago. If i remember correctly, I had to uninstall the octomap-visualization (octovis).
Try an:
apt-get install ros-electric-arm-navigation-experimental
and see what it shows as the next problem.
