Q:

launching image_view for a topic

I am trying to view the images my robot's cameras are receiving remotely.
The following in the command line will bring up a window with the video stream
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/stereo/right/image_raw

However I cannot find any information on how to put the "image:=/stereo/right/image_raw" part into a launch file
Alternatively, how can I use image_view in a python node to embed the video in a gui of my design?
I'm using:
ROS electric
Ubuntu 11.10
uvc_camera
Tkinter

A:

This is called remapping, and can be done using the remap tag.
You can display images from Python is using OpenCV's imshow function.
