Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: p2os teleop

Hi,
I'm using ros fuerte, pioneer 3dx robot and p2os(even though there's no version of p2os for ros fuerte, p2os works and i can publish cmd to robot - robot moves)..
so I need to use the joystick and to move robot manually. When I launch the teleop_joy.launch, it works well and it seems that connection is established, but pioneer doesn't move.
Since it didn't work, I've found this question http://answers.ros.org/question/39962/problem-with-p2os-teleop/ and did the remaping part in teleop_joy.launch:
remap from="/p2os_teleop/cmd_vel" to="/cmd_vel"
remap from="/p2os_teleop/joy" to ="/joy"
Again it didn't work. I also tried to include teleop_joy.launch in p2os.launch file, and again, connection is established and everyhing seems ok, but robot still dosen't move.. :/
when I call rxgraph function, I can see that cmd_vel is published from /p2os_teleop to /p2os driver.
any idea what else to do?
thank you in advance for your help :)

A:

It usually helps to use rostopic echo or rostopic hz to confirm that data are actually being published on all your topics of interest.

I've checked that also, but didn't help - everything seemed fine.. One friend of mine helped me, the problem was with hardvare-the joystick wasn't compatible :/ anyway, it works now :)
