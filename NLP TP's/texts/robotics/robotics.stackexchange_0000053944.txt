Q:

rosmake -> builds something with catkin?

Hi,
I've created a package with a source file as always.
roscreate-pkg testpkg roscpp
rosmake testpkg
But now it created several strange catkin files in the folder build and no source file of my code was build:
catkin/            CATKIN_IGNORE   CMakeFiles/          devel/  Makefile
catkin_generated/  CMakeCache.txt  cmake_install.cmake  gtest/  test_results/
And it doesn't work :/, I've never used catkin where does it come from!?

A:

Delete the CATKIN_IGNORE file and rosmake will work again.
Update to latest catkin version to prevent the generation of that files.
