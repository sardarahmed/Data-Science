Q:

building rosjava_core

I was trying to reinstall rosjava_core from source.
I uninstalled debian rosjava_core, and downloaded the newest version from source hg clone https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/ rosjava_core.
Then I tried to follow this tutorial (There seems to be an update for the rosjava_core on 31.March. the following two steps are deleted
./gradlew rosjava_bootstrap:install
rosrun rosjava_bootstrap install_generated_modules.py rosjava

). but as I run ./gradlew install the follwing failure occured.
it was no problem when I first installed rosjava from debian...
I noticed this is a problem when installing docs. I don't actually need them. can I skip this step?

A:

Had the same issue, inside your rosjava_core directory, there should be a file called settings.gradle. Open it up with your favorite editor, and after the comment header there is a line that says include 'rosjava_bootstrap' etc etc. The last one is 'docs', simply comment out that part and the install worked for me.
