Q:

Model editor, Open existing model

I use Gazebo 7.11 with ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
I am making some custom models using the Model Editor. How do I open an existing model to make further changes?

A:

As @raskkii's answer describes, you can insert it directly on the editor, but as @robotlab points out in their comment, the model is inserted as a "nested model" and is not editable.
Try this instead:

Open Gazebo
Before entering the model editor, insert the model from the insert menu
Right-click the model and choose Edit in Model Editor

Thanks for the suggestion, maybe this is the best or only way to do it, though I then experience an issue. If I insert my model into my world and right-click and select Edit, then it will open the model as-is. This is not a problem for static models, which are not affected by collision or gravity, however the has experience some changes in the world, then the new pose will be transferred to the Model Editor as well. Do you know a way to avoid this?

There is really no way to open the model directly in the Model Editor, would be very nice?

Yes, I agree it would be a nice feature to have, feel free to ticket a suggestion here: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues

As for the model changing position due to gravity, how about pausing the simulation before inserting it?

Sure, that may be the solution. I will ticket the suggestion. Thanks a lot for your swift help.
