Q:

File output With roslaunch

Hello everyone,
I just have a simple question on which i'm stuck for a few days :
I have a node in which I output a hand written log file using the c++ functions from fstream.
When i'm starting it using rosrun, my file are correctly generated.
However, using a rosrun is not practical when you want to use topics rename and I wanted to make it generic and to launch it with a roslaunch.
However, it appears that, when I start it with the roslaunch, I don't suceed anymore to write my output files.
I looked into the output option from the roslaunch, "screen" or "log" ( default) are available but in the doc it's written that they should redirect stdout/stderr (http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node) and not other custom outputs.
If you have any solution or any idee to fix it, I will welcome them with pleasure =D

Can you check whether you can find the files in $HOME/.ros?

And I will add a question since it's not very practical, Would you have an idee on how to change it's location ?

Please see #q235337.
Best practice is to use absolute paths, not relative ones.
Use parameters (and rospack find ..) to be able to keep flexibility.

Thanks =D
So the relative paths work with "direct" rosrun calls but not with roslaunch ones. Currently looking into your link for more details ! Thanks once more
