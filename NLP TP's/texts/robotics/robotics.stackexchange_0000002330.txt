Q:

Is it possible to achieve fully autonomous route following using PX4FMU module?

I have a quadcopter equipped with PX4FMU board. You may download its datasheet from HERE.
I wonder whether it is possible to program the quadcopter to autonomously follow a path like circular motion without any human interference. Are the built-in sensors enough for this task?
I also wonder how accurate the built-in GPS is? I read that it gives coordinates with a radius of 5m as error.

A:

There is everything on that board that you'd need for basic autonomous flight: 
A gyro (MPU6000) + an accelerometer (L3GD20) + a compass/magnetometer (HMC5883L) to measure your roll, pitch and yaw angles and a barometric pressure sensor (MS5611) to measure the altitude.
There is no GPS sensor though - Only the connector to use easily add one. You're right though, GPS will only give you 5/10 meter resolution (but that's not due to the sensor being in accurate, but rather the technique/method itself - Don't forget that it's using satellite in space (!) to do that measurement, so it's pretty good really!)
What that means is that GPS is only good for large scale flight path. Achieving  autonomous motion like this is a lot more difficult of course (in the video, they are "cheating", as they have cameras up in the ceiling watching down and tracking exactly where the quad is located). 
The board comes will lots of other goodies such as a buzzer, GPIO ports... but if you don't care about these, you're probably better off getting each sensors separately.
