A:

I've usually seen users have this problem in a few cases:

Your package isn't built - run catkin_make in your workspace
You haven't added your excutable to your CMakeLists.txt - follow the tutorial for adding your executable to your CMakeLists.txt
You executable is built, but it's in the wrong place - make sure you're calling catkin_package() before add_exectuable() in your CMakeLists.txt
