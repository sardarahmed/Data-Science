Q:

Using VTune for ROS profiling

Hi, All!
Can I use VTune Intel profiler for using in ROS? What are the basic steps to do it? In particular, how can I make symbolic information for VTune while ROS building? Thank you.

Would you happen to know how to do this with CMake? If so: Catkin is a set of macros and functions for CMake. You should be able to just use the CMake workflow for VTune.

A:

Couldn't use VTune in "launch application mode". But it wasn't any special to use it in "attach to process" mode (just building with debug configuration needed), and it worked fine. I think, question is not actual.
