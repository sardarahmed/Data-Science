Q:

$gazebo fails to work after installing gazebo_ros_pkgs

Hi. I'm in a dilemma. After installing gazebo_ros_pkgs, the 'rosrun/roslaunch gazebo_ros' commands work well and bring a Gazebo GUI.However when I run alone the command $gazebo in a terminal, nothing happens. Just nothing! Neither Gazebo GUI which is expected, nor warning/error information in the terminbal. I think something might go wrong with the environment variables or else, but I can't figure out. It's really awkward, for gazebo is there but not avaiable to me. I really need some help. Thanks.

Thank you very much. Gazebo works! May I ask what does this environment variable LIBGLALWAYSOFTWARE mean and how does it affect the way Gazebo works?
