Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: GLX missing

When tying to run rviz I get a bunch of this message:
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".

What is causing this? The rviz splash screen just flash in a sec. Using diamondback on Ubuntu 10.10.

What's your graphics card? Are you using the proprietary drivers?

A:

I resolved it by reinstalling nvidia drivers after a linux kernel update.
