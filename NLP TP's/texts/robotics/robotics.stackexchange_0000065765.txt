Q:

How to connect ROS to a MQTT broker

Hi all,
I'm totally new to ROS, and I want ROS to communicate  with a MQTT broker through the tcp protocol.
I have seen the TCPROS package but it needs the md5 sum which i don't have.
Is it possible to use TCPROS without md5 sum? How to do it?
Thanks

is there a project already begin worked-out ? I would like to write this package/ process. Or contribute to it.

Please don't add answers that are not answers; it is preferred to ask a new question. I found this ros-users that discusses this package. Perhaps it is worth looking into.

I'm new to ROS, but I have written a rospy script that changes messages from MQTT to ROS and vice versa. I have a few problems with it (mostly related to services being dumb and unable to send ROS images over them), but will post it once I find out how (just joined the site).

A:

They will not talk directly. They use different protocols. You will need to write a process which translates ROS messages in to MQTT compatible messages and resends them, as well as vice versa.
