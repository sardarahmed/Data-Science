Q:

Error in ROSWTF and doubt in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

My questions are at the end.
When i use the command to find the ROS PACKAGE PATH
sai@sai-desktop:~/fuerte_workspace$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/help:/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot_driver:/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot:/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros

After this, ROSWTF results in
sai@sai-desktop:~/fuerte_workspace$ roswtf

Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
No package or stack in context
================================================================================
Static checks summary:

Found 2 error(s).

ERROR Not all paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH [/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/help:/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot_driver:/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot:/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros] point to an existing directory:

================================================================================

ROS Master does not appear to be running.
Online graph checks will not be run.
ROS_MASTER_URI is [http://localhost:11311]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then I changed the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to
sai@sai-desktop:~/fuerte_workspace$ ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:

Then ROSWTF results in
sai@sai-desktop:~/fuerte_workspace$ roswtf
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf

My questions are

Initially why did the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH has such a big path?
Why are the errors turning up in ROSWTF?
The new ROS_PACKAGE_PATH which i have changed is a subset of old PATH. Is it OK to have a big path as the old one or do I have to change to new path?

Please let me know what i should do

A:

The ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in your case includes all entries in
/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/.rosinstall
you can manage this file using rosws:  www.ros.org/wiki/rosws
The ROS_PACKAGE_PATH can be very long, no problem. But all the paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH should exist, else they can be deleted.
The shortened ROS_PACKAGE path you posted does not include
/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot_driver:/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot

but if you want to use those packages, they need to be in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Just remove
/home/sai/fuerte_workspace/help

from your /home/sai/fuerte_workspace/.rosinstall file
