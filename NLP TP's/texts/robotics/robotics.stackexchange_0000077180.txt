Q:

How to build a rosbuild package from source

I can't find a good guide to do this. I have cloned the source using 'bzr branch', what are the next steps?
The package I am trying to use is sick_ldmrs.

A:

As you are probably on a recent ROS version, you will need to convert the package to the catkin build system. The catkin migration guide should contain all the relevant information. The catkin docs will also be useful.
edit: Whoops, my bad, I was just attended to the fact that you can actually use rosmake to build ros packages for the more recent distributions. Have a look at the rosbuild wiki and tutorials for more info.

Whether this specific package will build successfully on anything newer than Electric is of course also dependent on the way it interacts with its dependencies. If the code has bitrotted too much, rosbuild or catkin will just be one of the issues to fix.

Additionally: migrating the package to Catkin would probably be a good idea in any case. Do make sure there isn't a catkinised version somewhere (on Github fi) already.
