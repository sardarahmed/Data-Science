Q:

How to tell a stepper motor's position, or detect slippage

I am creating a CNC machine on a budget, using old motors out of printers/scanners/etc. 
I am limited to about 650mA for the whole system, so my fear is that when the cutting bit touches the material, the stepper might be moving too quickly and won't have enough torque.  This would mean it will become one rotation behind, which could really mess up a CNC project.
Detecting when the motor "misses" a step would allow me to readjust the motor speed until it reaches a balance between working quickly and having adequate torque.  How can I achieve this?

A:

The ONLY difference between a stepper and a servo is that a Servo monitors its position with an encoder, and may increase power if it gets behind, or reduce power if it gets ahead, or generates a 'fault' condition if it is unable to move to the proper position in a predetermined time frame.
There is no difference in power requirements. Any stepper can be a servo by the addition of encoders and closed loop electronics. Any Servo can be a stepper by bypassing the closed loop.
As long as power requirements are planned, a less expensive stepper is a good choice, like moving a print head on a rail. Servo's are more appropriate when there may be some unknown power requirement, like on a CNC cutting machine.
