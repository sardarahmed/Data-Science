Q:

where is the calibration info of usb_cam?

i have used camera_calibration to generate my desired calibration info .
but ,how can i apply this data to my application.
i can see the original calibration info by
" rostopic echo /usb_cam/camera_info".
and how can i find the location of the "/usb_cam/camera_info",

then edit it by replacing by the previous calibration.
in a word,where does my camera driver store its calibration information ?
thanks!!!

A:

The standard place to put the camera calibration file is in ~/.ros/camera_info/. For example the camera calibration node will export the calibration result for usb_cam to ~/.ros/camera_info/usb_cam.yaml.

I use the usb_cam driver, I calibrated the camera, but I don't have a camera_info folder in ~/.ros.

You have to calibrate the camera using camera_calibration (see http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration) and then generate the yaml file using camera_calibration_parsers (see http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration_parsers). Copy the yaml file into that folder.
