Q:

Fastening sheet steel on nylon

I'm trying to attach a small piece of sheet steel (30mm x 50mm x 1mm) to a small piece of nylon (50mm x 50mm x 4mm). Does anyone know how they could be fastened using small screws (

Any thought appreciated.

A:

I would just use machine screws. Drill clearance holes in the steel, drill narrower holes through the nylon. Then it will be easy to hand tap threads in the nylon with an appropriate tap for the screws you are using. Threads in nylon will be fine for light-duty use.
(Where I am metric screws are common, and I'd use M3 or maybe M4 screws with the standard pitch, these should be available in a short length.)
