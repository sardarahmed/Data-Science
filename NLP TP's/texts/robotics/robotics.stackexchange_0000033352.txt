Q:

No transform from [base_link] to [/map]

I started to create my URDF robot model, using ros tutorials as reference.
But when I try to visualize the model using rviz, an error happens:
.Global Options
.Global Status: warning

Fixed frame: No tf data. Actual error: Fixed Frame [/map] does not exist

Grid (Grid)

Robot Model (Robot Model):

Status: Error
base_link: No transform from [base_link] to [/map]

What am I missing here?

A:

I may not be considering this correctly, but it may be as simple as changing your "fixed frame" under ".Global Options" to "/", "/world", or some fixed frame that you do have a transform for. "/base_link"

According to the error message, I guess the fixed frame should be /base_link.

Nice. Thank you.

How do you change this? It appears to be a readonly field in RViz.
