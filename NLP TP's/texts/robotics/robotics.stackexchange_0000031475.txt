Q:

ROS and Research Robotics Career Finder

I was wondering if there were any plans on doing a "career board" for people involved in the ROS Community.
More specifically, a place where people can find jobs with companies that do research robotics and personal robotics.  Also, a place where companies can post internship, co-op, and full time job postings for members of the ROS community to see.
I'm reaching the end of my academic career, and it's never too early to start looking.

A:

While not ROS specific, the robotics-worldwide mailing list is a good place to find numerous postings of jobs, internships, postdoc/phd positions, and conference/journal/workshop announcements.
