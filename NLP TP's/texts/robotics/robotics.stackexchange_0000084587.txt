Q:

rviz display is blacked out

I am using ROS indigo. My PC configuration is Dell Vostro intel i5 processor.  I have installed all the essential dependencies of rviz.
Could you tell me what's the problem?

Could you please attach your image directly to the question? I've given you enough karma to do that.

Btw: you have 3 answered questions, but none are accepted. If those answers are in fact correct, you should accept them. I wouldn't have to give you additional karma in that case.

QT might be picking up the wrong color from the Ubuntu theme. Try changing to the default theme in Ubuntu.

Another possibility is that you have a QT environment variable set that is overriding the theme. You might run printenv | grep QT to see what you have set.

Well actually I could not understand what to do so I removed ubuntu and installed again and ROS as well. And now it works fine. I don't know what was the problem. Thank you.
