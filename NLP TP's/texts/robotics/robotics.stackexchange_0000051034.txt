Q:

Rosinstall to install a download pack, something trivial?

Hi all.
I am a newbie here, and I have followed up all the beginner and intermediate level tutorials from ROS webpage.
I still don't understand how to use "rosinstall" command to install a third party package downloaded from website say GitHub
(in particular this one: https://github.com/segwayrmp/segway-rmp-ros-pkg.)
Here are the steps I took:
I ran rosinstall pwd/segway_rmpX.rosinstall
But it gave me:
"ERROR in rosinstall:
No 'ros' stack detected in candidates [].
Please add the location of a ros distribution to this command."
Anyhow, the purpose of this post is not only to seek solution to my problems encountered above, but more important, could somebody give me a simple guidance I should follow on installing a 3rd party package?
I know this seems to be a trivial question, but I am very confused about installation process. On the website, some even said you don't need to run rosinstall to install a package.
Thank you for your time! CheerS!

A:

Here is the rosinstall documentation.
Rosinstall provides a niced rosws command that is convenient for rosbuild workspaces.
For catkin workspaces, wstool provides similar commands (install it from python-wstool). See REP-0133.
