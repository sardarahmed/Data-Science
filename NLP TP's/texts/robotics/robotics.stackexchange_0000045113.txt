Q:

How do you exit back to safe mode after running a roslaunch file?

Hi
I am using a roomba to run turtlebot on, I have a specific launch file that I run, but I still haven't figured out how to stop it?! To end the session i typically kill the running processes but then robot is still in receiving mode and I have to do a hard reset to make the roomba work again as normal (we are using it as a vacuum cleaner so I don't like resetting it every time i use it)
Is there any real turning of command so to say?
Thanks

Thanks tfoote, not really sure how I would use the ~set_operation_mode command, atleast did not manage to execute it. I have no powerboard, and connecting to my roomba 780 directly with the irobot serial usb cable but havent really gotten the dashboard to show me any status from the robot, is there something special detail there to take notice to make it to work?

Aha, that was a clever way. Will try that out today, because still have to do alot of manual resets! Thanks

Jbuesch, what kind of launch file do you use then for your roomba? I tried your trick/idea but i then just get my roomba to go in a loop into passive mode all the time... when you say put it as the last line of spin() that means to put it just below the r.sleep() command right?

A:

First I think you need to be in passive mode for it to drive itself.  And secondly there are two options, one is to put it into passive mode using the dashboard before you shutdown the TurtleBot software.  The second is to call the rosservice directly with the passive command  ~set_operation_mode (Note the turtlebot_driver needs to still be running for either of these solutions to work.)
