Q:

hector_slam + rviz

A:

when using gmapping , gmapping connects the /map frame to /odom frame then you begin to visualize the map in rviz and I suppose that you may use hector_slam for this because hector_slam uses hector_mapping. check out http://www.ros.org/wiki/hector_slam/Tutorials/SettingUpForYourRobot
