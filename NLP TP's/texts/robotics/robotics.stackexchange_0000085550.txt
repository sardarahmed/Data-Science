Q:

Unable to establish ssh connection : No authentication methods available

I'm trying to run nodes on two different machines within the same launch file, so I am using the <machine> tag to do so.
<machine name="roboRIO" address=10.9.0.29" env-loader="path/to/script" user="admin" />
The user doesn't require a password. I can definitely ssh onto the remote host with that same IP. I'm not sure what the problem could be. Any help is appreciated.

Try specifying the environment loader script on your second machine. Have a look here on how to do so.

Also ROS uses different SSH key algorithm than the one used with default SSH client. Have a look here on how to solve it.

A:

The key to answering this was actually adding a password. There was some weirdness while trying to log into the second device via ssh with a blank password.
