Q:

Install ROS on Linux Mint 16

The next instalment in the ever-updating series of installation questions: Is it possible to install ROS on Linux Mint 16 (which is based off Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy)? I've tried using the Raring packages, and (perhaps unsurprisingly) they don't work.
I've also tried installing from source (using this guide), encouraged by some forum posts suggesting that installing from source should work on Ubuntu Saucy. I run into problems when I get to the step that attempts to install the dependencies (rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y). Specifically, I get ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies, followed by the list of dependencies paired with the message Unsupported OS [mint]. Is there any way to get around this?

A:

For this specific step setting ROS_OS_OVERRIDE might help you get further. Basically rosdep doesn't know mint. Just tell it to assume it's ubuntu and hope it works.
