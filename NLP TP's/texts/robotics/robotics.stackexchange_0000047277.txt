Q:

help for writing a rosinstall on rosdisto

Hi
I wrote four ros pkg's all are located in one git repo.

Do I have to write four rosinstall files on rosdisto?
How should I design the the rosinstall file because one cannot checkout a git sub-folder?

Greetings

A:

It is common to have multiple packages in one git repo, and this would just be a single rosinstall entry in rosdistro. If you wanted to provide your packages separately from one another, you'd have to move them to separate repos (or use svn).
