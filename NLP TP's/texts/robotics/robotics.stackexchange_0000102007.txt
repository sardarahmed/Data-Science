Q:

How to set the rollouts from the Autoware op_local_planner package only on the driveable area (Vectormap)

Hey everyone,
EDIT: seems like i don't  have enough karma points to upload an image please check also here:

I' am currently implementing an obstacle avoidance scenario in CARLA.
Required information:
Operating system and version: Ubuntu 18.04
Autoware install From source
Autoware.ai version: 1.13 
checked out this versions: 
- https://github.com/hatem-darweesh/core_planning/tree/openplanner.1.13
- https://github.com/hatem-darweesh/core_perception/tree/openplanner.1.13
- https://github.com/hatem-darweesh/common/tree/openplanner.1.13
ROS distribution and version: melodic
ROS install From source(apt)
CARLA Version: 0.9.6
Package : op_global_planner, op_local_planner

Steps to Reproduce:
Normally start the application. . .

ROS: roscore
Simulator: DISPLAY= ./CarlaUE4.sh -opengl
autoware_bridge_with_manual_Control
ray_ground_filter.launch
can2odom
points_downsample
ndt_matching
vel_pose_connector
lidar_euclidean_cluster_detect
lidar_kf_contour_track
op_global_planner
op_local_planner
pure_pursuit
twist_filter
vehiclecmd_to_ackermanndrive
carla_ackermann_control_node

I load the vector map by using the vector_map_loader node and then i tell the planner to watch for the map data within the autoware rack with the flag "0".
The picture/video shows exactly what my problem is, the vehicle routes the car outside the driveable area. How can I tell the local planner to generate the rollouts only inside the Asian vector_map.
I know there is also some kind of curb detection which unfortunately does not work for me. I think this is because there is no curb data in the sample maps (Town01, ...). Also, this would not solve the problem if there are parts without curbs, e.g. a meadow that should not be driven on either.
I hope you can help me here
