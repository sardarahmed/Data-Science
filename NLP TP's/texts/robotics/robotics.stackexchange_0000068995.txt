Q:

tf error base_link to map

Hello,
I'm new in ROS and I need to continue a project. When i try to launch it, I've got this warning.
[ WARN] [1438259230.147675462, 875.589000000]: Waiting on transform from simplebot/base_link to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: . canTransform returned after 875.589 timeout was 0.1.

I don't know what does it mean and where to look. I've look on ROS answer but I didn't find anything which help me.
Here is the tf tree.

A:

The message is complaining that canTransform() is not able to get the relationship of simplebot/base_link to /map. This is because you only have a frame called "base_link" instead of "simplebot/base_link".
So modify your code by changing the arguments of canTransform().
