Q:

How to tackle 'symbol lookup error' and 'ros::InvalidNameException' on Odroid

I am trying to run camera calibration on my Odroid U3 running Lubuntu 13.04. I ran the following command :
rosrun uvc_camera uvc_camera_node width:=640 height:=480 frame:=camera device:=/dev/video0
after which a i got an error :
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'ros::InvalidNameException'
what():  Character [4] is not valid as the first character in Graph Resource Name [480].  Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, / and in some cases ~.
Aborted (core dumped)
running the same command without specifying height and width, i get the following error:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/uvc_camera/uvc_camera_node: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libimage_transport.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7package10getPluginsERKSsS2_RSt6vectorISsSaISsEEb
How do I overcome this problem??
I have followed earlier tutorials successfully and have sourced required files.

A:

Two issues:
(1) It doesn't look like you're supplying the parameters to the uvc_camera node properly. Private parameters should be prefixed with an _. Try:
rosrun uvc_camera uvc_camera_node _width:=640 _height:=480 _frame:=camera _device:=/dev/video0

(2) It looks like you've picked up the ABI breakage in roslib. Try upgrading everything to the latest version:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

If apt says that there are "held packages" or "packages not upgraded" then do a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade as well.

Thanks! the first step didn't work..i tried apt-get update but i got an error:
Failed to fetch http://winswitch.org/dists/precise/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-armhf/Packages' in Release file)
Wont lubuntu upgrade to a higher version and screw up hydro with apt-get upgrade?

It looks like you have a winswitch repo configured, but it doesn't support armhf. You should probably remove that from your apt sources and try again.
apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade both install new versions of packages; they don't upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu.
