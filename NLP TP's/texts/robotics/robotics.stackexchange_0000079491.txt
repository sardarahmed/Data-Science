Q:

No module rospkg, No module PySide2, No module PyQt5

Hi I installed Ros and am going through the tutorials. It looks like my installation is not correct because when I run the Understanding Ros Topics tutorial and the command:
$ rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph 

I get errors about no rospkg module, no PySide2 modle no PyQt5 module. I just installed rospkg seperately with
$pip install rospkg

but I cannot get the other two errors to go away. I also don't want to have to install all these modules seperately.
If I try to reinstall Ros full with the commaned:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

I get the message:
ros-kinetic-desktop-full is already the newest version (1.3.0-0xenial-20170303-123712-0800).
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 206 not upgraded.

What is the proper way to handle this?

Btw, please copy-paste the entire log output, instead of explaining by your own words (e.g. saying "no PySide2" provides not enough info). That makes harder for us to see what's happening.

A:

Looks like you're on Ubuntu Xenial, so install rospkg via apt-get as its wiki page instruction says.

UPDATE @gvdhoorn

Shouldn't rospkg and the other modules have been installed automatically during installation of desktop-full?

It should be. So something is wrong with the OP's environment. rospkg seems to be depended by some core packages on my Ubuntu 14.04.
$ apt-cache rdepends python-rospkg
python-rospkg

@stevens1111: are you using any alternative Python interpreters by any chance? Like Anaconda? Or do you have multiple versions of Python on your machine? ROS depends on Python2, not 3.
