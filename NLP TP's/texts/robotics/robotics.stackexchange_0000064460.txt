Did you make that usarsim_inf package??

A:

it seems that you have not make(Compile) your usarsim_inf package.
follow these steps to make the usarsim_inf package:-

Go into the usarsim_inf folder using cd command

set the environment variable path using this command:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:pwd

run the following command:
 rosmake usarsim_inf

then verify your package is successfully made or not by following command:
rospack find usarsim_inf

it will show the path of your folder and then you will be able to use this package.
