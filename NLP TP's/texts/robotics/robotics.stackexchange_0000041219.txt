Q:

Problems Creating a Gazebo Plugin

I'm trying to simulate a tricycle robot using Gazebo that comes with ROS. I know how to create the simulation model that, however I've been unable to control the robot's movement. From what I've understood from the tutorials and forums, I need to create a plugin. To do so, I've tried to follow this tutorial:
http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/GazeboPluginIntro .
However, I've been unable to compile the simple_world_plugin.
Does anyone know of a better step by step tutorial regarding this issue?
Thank you for your attention.

Are you on ROS electric or fuerte? The plugin API changed between versions, so that could explain your error.

I'm currently using diamondback. Which one should i use for this tutorial!?

A:

The tutorial you reference says it is for ROS Fuerte, which has an entirely new version of Gazebo (1.0).
You should probably upgrade to Fuerte, then try the tutorial again.
