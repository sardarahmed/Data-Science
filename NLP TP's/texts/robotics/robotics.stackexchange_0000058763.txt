Q:

What does the sim_time mean?

Hello , every earnest folk
The question what headline states has confused me a long time . I can't understand that parameter's meaning. I have seen introduction from here many times ,But it still puzzles me .In my opinion ,sim_granularity and vx_sample have decided the distance should be forward_simulated .So ,what does the sim_time mean ?
