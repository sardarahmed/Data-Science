Q:

Automatic loading of a ROS launch file

I would like to configure my Ubuntu 11.04 such that it automatically boot into console (instead of graphical interface) and then run a ROS launch file. Any idea how to do that?

A:

If you want to disable Ubuntu's GUI, you can follow these steps:
Edit "/etc/init/gdm.conf" and comment out the following lines:
 start on (filesystem
           and started hal
           and tty-device-added KERNEL=tty7
           and (graphics-device-added or stopped udevtrigger))

so that they look like this:
#start on (filesystem
#          and started hal
#          and tty-device-added KERNEL=tty7
#          and (graphics-device-added or stopped udevtrigger))

As far as autoboot of roslaunch, I've demonstrated that in my answer to this question. Have a look.
