Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: compiling msg

Hi,
everytime, when I compile my package from scratch,
I have to comment out some lines in my CMakeList.txt

addexecutable(file file.cpp )
target_link_libraries(file {catkin_LIBRARIES} )

Afterwards it can compile my custom msg and then I include those lines and the project is ready to use.
What must I do that I can compile it as once?
regard,
Peter

Please edit your post and provide more information, such as your entire CMakeLists.txt file (without all the comments though).

A:

You are missing a dependency on the message generation to make sure that the message generation runs before the executable tries to compile.
If you edit your post to show the compile error and your CMakeLists.txt we can probably help you more.
