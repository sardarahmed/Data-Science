Q:

How to use ROS Mobile for ROS2

In ROS1 I used to use my mobile phone as a controller using the ROS Mobile Android application. Can the same application be used for ROS 2? If not, is there a way to use my mobile phone to publish/subscribe and visualise topics in ROS2?

Hey,
Currently ROS-Mobile does not support communication with ROS 2. It will (hopefully) in the nearer future.
There are however some good resources to take a look at for interversion communication like the ros1_bridge on Github: https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge
Kind regards,
One of the contributors of ROS-Mobile
