Q:

Test Environment Maps for Robot Navigation

Hello,
I was wondering if there is a database of different environment maps for testing robot navigation in ROS. In particular, I'm looking for an open space environment map without narrow corridors and many obstacles.
Thanks.

What format are you looking for? Just a map, i.e. yaml/ppm?
Comment by ROSCMBOT on 2014-09-13:
Yes yaml/pgm files would be fine

A:

If you're looking to test navigation with fake maps (i.e. environments in simulation), you should probably try using the gazebo simulator. I'm not sure if any of the gazebo environments come with pgm maps ready to plugin, but running a gmapping cycle with a teleoperated robot would be a good opportunity to test the robot's control/sensor setup.
A 2D map is as much a product of your robot's sensor setup as it is of the environment.

Thanks. I'm using rviz because it provides many visualization tools to debug sensors and the navigation module. That's why I'd rather test work on 2D maps for now just because of rviz.

The map alone won't do you any good, you need the simulated sensor feedback from the environment if you want to run tests. This is what gazebo provides (as a simulator), alongside rviz (a visualizer). There is also this 2D simulator which comes with some maps.

Thanks a lot Paul. I think I was confused about rviz as a visualizer and gazebo as a simulator. Now it's ,more clear to me.
