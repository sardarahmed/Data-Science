Q:

Hello guys. I have a scenario in which i have to control (basically send messages to) a master node from the internet

The machine has apache2 and ROS Master. I have also built a Wordpress site on the same machine. What i want to do is to access that wordpress site from the internet (i will buy a router) and use it to send messages to and receive from the ROS Master. Any ideas ?

A:

Have a look at rosbridge_suite and roslibjs.
Keep in mind that having your ROS master or rosbridge server available on the internet means that anyone can access it, unless you explicitly add access controls.

Thanks for the quick reply. I will look into it and this is only for a proof of concept. I will be developing more on that later.

Hello, nishthapa! I have this same issue... How did you made the connection between the 2 nodes? Can you share your code, or part of it? If you prefer, we can talk by e-mail, or facebook chat or whatever...
Thanks!

Predrucius, if you mean the internet (a webpage), and the Master node then you will have to keep your master node under a port forwarded router having a public IP. And of course you will have to code the webpage (with JavaScript) yourself. If you want more help, mail me.

Thanks man! My router had a problem, but now it's solved. Just a simple port forwarding did the trick.
