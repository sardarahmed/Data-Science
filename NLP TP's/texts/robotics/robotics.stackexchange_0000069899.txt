A:

There are some tutorials that are actually targeted for Android but they basically do what you need. The difference is that they are doing a cross-compilation of the C++ code for an ARM target processor. Then there are several steps that show how to wrap the native code and load it in your java application. If you carefully take out the Android related stuff you should be able to get the needed functionality.
