Q:

How to know which object roboearth is seeing

Hi!
I'm new with roboearth. I've already created some models in my computer and I have also succeded when trying to detect the object. The problem is: when I load different models and I put the detector to work, is there any way to know which object is being detected? I mean, is there a service/node/something that says "I've detected a box", "I've detected a can", etc. ?
Any help is welcome! Thanks!

A:

The recognized objects should be published on the re_kinect/detection_results topic, see also here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/re_kinect_object_detector?distro=fuerte
You should be able to see them by calling the following command in a terminal:
rostopic echo /re_kinect/detection_results
