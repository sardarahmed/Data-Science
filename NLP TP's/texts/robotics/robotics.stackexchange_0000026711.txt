Q:

Gazebo 1.9.1 does not cast shadows on COLLADA meshes

I rendered this image with Gazebo 1.9.1, ROS Hydro, and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
image description http://wunderkammerlab.com/examples/no-shadows-received.jpg
The robot casts shadows, and the robot and terrain receive them, but the starting platform and the chair (both COLLADA meshes) do not, but should. I thought there might be a problem with my SketchUp-generated starting platform DAE file, so I put the chair from /opt/ros/hydro/share/gazebo_plugins/Media/models/chair/models/Chair.dae into the scene. Is there an element that I need to add to my DAE files in order for them to receive shadows, or is receiving shadows on DAE meshes a missing feature in OGRE or Gazebo?
