Q:

Warning "No map received" occurs, when trying to visualize map in rviz

Hello,
i am trying to visualize a map in rviz using slam_gmapping on my youbot. When adding the display Map to rviz and choosing map as topic the warning "No map received" occurs. I can visualize the sensor data in rviz by adding the display laser scan but it does not create a map.
I searched for this error in ros answers but could not find an answer fixing my problem.
The ROS_MASTER_URI is set to my youbot: ROS_MASTER_URI=http: //Jakobs-youBot:11311/
My tf tree is map -> odom -> base_footprint -> scan.
My laser scan topic is scan.
I am starting slam_gmapping with
$ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan

and do not get any output after starting it. Is this supposed to be like that?
I am using a youbot with ubuntu 12.04 and ROS hydro. My the laser i am using is a hokuyo laser.
I really do not have any idea what i am doing wrong. If anyone can help me, i would really appreciate it. If you need any more information, please let me know.
Thanks a lot.

A:

If your laser topic is scan you should not add the remapping scan:=base_scan. This would tell gmapping that the laser topic is base_scan.

when using the remapping i do not get any warnings in my terminal. When not adding it i get the warning: Failed to compute laser pose, aborting initialization ("base_link" passed to lookupTransform argument target_frame does not exist. )

Good! This mean that it received a scan now. Your TF setup seems to be missing something. You need to check if the mentioned frames exist or give the correct ones as parameters to gmapping.

Yes, that helped a lot. Tanks. I wrote a launch file, that uses my parameters.
