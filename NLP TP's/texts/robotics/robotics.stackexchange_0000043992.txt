Q:

How to set verbosity/logger levels programmatically?

Hi All,
Is there a way to set verbosity/logger levels programmatically (up to node levels if possible)? How?
I have looked at here and here.
It seems that I should somehow use log4cxx::Logger, cmiiw, but still do not know exactly how?
Please help.
Thanks a lot.
PS: Hopefully, for both roscpp and rospy (+roslisp)

A:

Or simply add
 if( ros::console::set_logger_level(ROSCONSOLE_DEFAULT_NAME, ros::console::levels::Debug) )
    ros::console::notifyLoggerLevelsChanged();

in your nodes constructor. Replace Debug with your required logger level.
Don't forget to
#include <ros/console.h>
