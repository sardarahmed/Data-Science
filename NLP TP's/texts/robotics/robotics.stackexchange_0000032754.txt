Q:

Programmatic way to stop roslaunch

I saw in the description of roslaunch this:
"roslaunch is an important tool that manages the start and stop of ROS nodes"
But I am not able to find how to stop a roslaunch.
Is there any method to kill all nodes of a roslaunch in one instructions?
Thank You

You can also pass the SIGINT to whatever subprocess handle you started it with in code.
