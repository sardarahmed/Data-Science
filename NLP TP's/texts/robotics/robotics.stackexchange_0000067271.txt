My  idea is that   this error occurs related with urdf  , urdf_parser_plugin and  liburdfdom-tools ..  I searched that liburdfdom-tools is old and not related with ROS    but I have been installed that and I  couldnt fix it.. there is the time important for develop the robot for my Thesis   lead me please..
what can I do for fix it ?
by the way I use ROS / indigo

A:

The error tells you that urdf/03-origins.udf cannot be found. If the file does exist, it's likely that you forgot to execute those commands in the correct working directory.
See Error in Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch and / or No Visual Robot Model with URDF.
