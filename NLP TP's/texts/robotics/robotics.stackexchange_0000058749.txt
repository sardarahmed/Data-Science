Q:

Is there a windows version of SLAM?

Hello,everybody,I want to know if there is a windows version of SLAM. If there is no ,my next task may be transplanting the code from linux to windows ,which would be a huge work for me ! Thank you.

I think that you can choose Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Robot_Programming_Toolkit ) if your task is a research of SLAM. MRPT works on Windows.

MRPT is a cross-platform and open source C++ library ,if I develop a Graphical interface about robot in Visual Studio 2010,I can use MRPT as a libary directly,so there is no need to transplant the code in ROS from linux to windows. Can I understand like that?

@danmianjing_00: Exactly!

Thank you. Something else, that is to say,the packages in ROS are generated by buliding a framework with using MRPT libraries,then wrapper packages.So I can use MRPT in VS2010 to wrapper my package to achieve a certain function,such as gmapping package. Am I right?

A:

@danmianjing_00: I'm not sure. you mean that you will use ROS. There is not a windows version on ROS. If you want to use ROS, I recommend you to learn Ubuntu.
