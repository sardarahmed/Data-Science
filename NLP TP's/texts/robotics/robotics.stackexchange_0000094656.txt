Q:

Is dynamic topic remapping implemented in ROS2 Dashing?

Based on the documentation I have seen at the links below
https://design.ros2.org/articles/static_remapping.html (bottom of page)
https://www.osrfoundation.org/wordpress2/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ROSCON-2014-Why-you-want-to-use-ROS-2.pdf (slides 23 -24)
It seems ros2 nodes are supposed to support dynamic remapping of their topics at runtime. However, I do not see any documentation on this. I feel this feature is useful during development and debugging, so I would like to see it implemented.
Is this feature implemented in Dashing? If not, is it still on the roadmap?

A:

No, it is not yet implemented and still on the roadmap: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Roadmap/#new-features
Atm there is no plan for anybody to work on this in the foreseeable future.

Do you know if it is still in the roadmap or if it has been implemented?
