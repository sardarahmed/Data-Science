Q:

joystick continuous cmd_vel

Dear friends,
I'm using hector_quadrotor simulation in ROS hydro with gazebo.
I can successfully use an xbox joystick to move as it is described in the tutorials.
In order to move it in x of y direction I should point the stick and repeated again and again the movement to send the related message.
Is it how it works or I have set something wrong?
Could this be done continuously, meaning that I can keep the stick pointing in the x direction and the messages transmitted continuously?

A:

In case the joystick interfaced with ROS via joy/joy_node, you can try ~autorepeat_rate parameter as described here:

Auto-Repeat/Signal Loss
The joy_node takes an
"~autorepeat_rate" parameter. If the
linux kernal receives no events during
the autorepeat interval, it will
automatically repeat the last value of
the joystick. This is an important
safety feature, and allows users to
recover from a joystick that has timed
out.

Thanks Boris :)
And yes, as the name says it is not ON(1) or OFF(0) but actually a rate in Hz!
