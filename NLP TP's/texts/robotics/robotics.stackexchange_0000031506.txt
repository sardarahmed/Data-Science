Q:

How much can I control ROS real-time behavior?

Hello all,
I'm quite new on ROS and I've a question which answer could not find in the web.
The question is originated by this phrase: "ROS is not a realtime framework, though it is possible to integrate ROS with realtime code"
My question is: How can I control ROS real-time behavior? I know I can control process priority with 'nice' and 'renice' commands but not single threads' priority. In short I'd like to know how many "hidden" threads (I refer for example to communication threads, rostcp, etc...) and if it is possible to change their priority and manage their activation in any way.
On the other hand I read about orocos-ros integration. However if I'm right it is limited to visualize orocos' nodes status while all the control work is performed by RTT. Am I right?
Thanks in advance for the answer(s).

You may also want to have a look at the PR2 controller node.  http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_controller_manager

Hello, this falls outside of my knowledge but maybe this post can help you: http://answers.ros.org/question/298/a-hard-real-time-ros

A:

Assuming you are using Linux, the function you are looking for may be pthread_setschedparam
This appears to allow the priority of individual threads to be set without renicing the parent process.
