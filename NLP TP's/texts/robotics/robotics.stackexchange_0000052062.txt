Q:

getting basic hardware on Raspberry Pi working with ROS

Hello, I have a ROS Groovy Galapagos bare bones installation from binary on the Raspberry Pi which has a Raspbian wheezy running on it. Please let know how to use it for some simple hardware like a switch and an LED connected to to the RPi. I would like the switch to switch on/off the LED through the ROS installation on the RPi.
Thanks in advance,
Praseen

All,
I am currently working on the same thing and got at least the GPIOs working. SPI, I2C, RS232 is implemented but not tested yet. What you need is the bosch_drivers package
http://www.ros.org/wiki/bosch_drivers
Up to this point it only supports the Arduino and the Sub20 as hardware interface but I wrote a raspi_interface as well. You can get it from my private repo
https://github.com/kalectro/raspi_interface.git
As you can see it is still under heavy development but as I said the GPIOs should be working. I make use of the awesome wiringPi library which needs to be installed. Get it from here

Feel free to fork or submit issues if you find any bugs or have any suggestions
Kai
