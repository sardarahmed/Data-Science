Q:

ros libuvc_camera stopped working

I am using the rosrun on Nvidia Ubuntu 14.04 platform and i have USB Camera ( UVC Complaint ), i ran the following,
roscore
rosrun libuvc_camera camera_node
It worked fine, then i started installing the other components like kinect, stereo camera drivers ( some more components )
after that it stopped working,
root@tegra-ubuntu:/home/ubuntu# rosrun --debug libuvc_camera camera_node
[rosrun] Looking in catkin libexec dirs: /opt/ros/indigo/lib/libuvc_camera
[rosrun] Looking in rospack dir: /opt/ros/indigo/share/libuvc_camera
[rosrun] Searching for camera_node with permissions /111
[rosrun] Running  /opt/ros/indigo/lib/libuvc_camera/camera_node
[ INFO] [1474173238.408420389]: Opening camera with vendor=0x0, product=0x0, serial="", index=0
uvc_start_iso_streaming: Busy (-6)
before running this command, i have two video nodes video0 & video1 and i could able to see both videos using luvcview.
After i ran this command, i got only the video0 only ( also it seems that earlier video1 node becomes video0 )
Please share your inputs

I have met this issue too.
And, I found that, if i uninstall "compressed-image-transport", then it works again.
But, I still don't know how to resolve it without uninstalling "compressed-image-transport".
