Q:

Problem creating OctoMap from PointCloud2

Hi I am trying to create an octomap from PointCloud2. I load the pointcloud from my ply file convert it into PointCloud2 and publish it on 'cloud_in' topic. The messages are published file. I then launch the octo map node via the launch file which is below
<!-- Octomap Server -->
<node pkg="octomap_server" type="octomap_server_node" name="octomap">
    <param name="resolution" value="0.05" />

    <param name="frame_id" type="string" value="base_link" />

    <param name="max_sensor_range" value="20.0" />

    <param name="latch" value="false" />
    <remap from="cloud_in" to="occupied_cells_vis" />

</node>

but unfortunately I cant see anything on Rviz MarkerArray which is listening to occupied_cells_vis.
What am I doing wrong here ????

Is the transform correct? your remap should be from="cloud_in" to=the topic you publish with the messages

I could already create octomap from pointcloud. In your line '' change the occupied_cells_vis to the output topic from your pointcloud. Make sure that your output topic of point cloud has the kind of message poincloud2 and has data in the output.

Hi,
I have the same problem, but instead of occupied_cells_vis I use my_cloud, which is the topic that provides the pointCloud2. What I  doing wrong?
I saw the chris_ comment and I don't know where I can put the transform, however I own the topics publish the transformation (tf and tf_static).
Best Regards
