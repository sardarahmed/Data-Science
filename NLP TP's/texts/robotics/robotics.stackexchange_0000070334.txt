Q:

best way to compare two pose estimates from different sources

Hi all,
I have a mobile robot with navigation_stack up and running. The robot is able to navigate properly from point A to point B. I am using encoders to get the odometry data and IMU, encoders and Lidar (AMCL) using robot_localization to localize the robot and move_base for planning. Now, I have a Ultrawide band sensor which gives the pose of the robot in the global frame. I want to compare the pose estimated by UWB sensor and the actual pose of the robot (output of robot_localization)(both gives pose_estimate in the map frame). Both poses are of the form of nav_msgs/Odometry. I know I can subscribe to both topics and compare the pose values from both of them and see how different they are. I was just wondering if there is a standard way or a better way to compare two pose estimates of the same type coming from different sources. Any suggestions regarding it will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

The values are going to be time stamped from both, correct? I usually use MATLAB for something like this. You can eyeball it with rviz, but MATLAB is great for this kind of thing.

I want to know this answer too... can you update? thanks.

A:

Python is a great alternative for this as well. You can read directly from bag files and use any number of plotting tools to visualize the data you desire.
