Q:

how to add a repository as a dependency in the package.xml and add it as a component to in the cmakelists

Dear All,
There is a repository API for Kuka youbot named youbot_driver which includes other packages/folder and libraries and a Yaml file. I want to link against this repository from a catkin package(IT DOSE NOT consist of Include folder as a catkin package). There is a folder named youbot which includes .ccp and .h files. Regardless of declaring these headers in the main node, I have to add this repository to .xml and cmakelists. Would you please tell how I can do this?
sincerely,

A:

In your package.xml add
<build_depend>youbot_driver</build_depend>
<run_depend>youbot_driver</run_depend>

and in your CMakeLists.txt add youbot_driver to find_package and catkin_package.

Thanks. It means that there is no difference between a repository including some packages/folders and a single package in the way that we declare them in .xml and  cmakelists?

Well, youbot_driver is a single package. How complexd the package is plays no role.

@BennyRe. My problem is solved. The package could drive the youbot well. Thanks for your help.
