Q:

Plotting points in x y frame

I want to plot the position of an object in a x-y 2D field.
Every time step the new position has to be added so you can see the path, similar to the turtle walking around in turtlesim.
I tried using rxplot, but this inserts an extra dimension for the time, and I want to have a 2D plane.
Has anyone a suggestion?

You can publish a LINE_LIST visualization_msgs/Marker to rviz.
