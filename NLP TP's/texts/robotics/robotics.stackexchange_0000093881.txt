Q:

gzserver is not responding on Windows 10

Hi everyone!
I've installed ROS on a Windows 10 machine using this official guide. When I run gzserver in a ROS Command Window, it basically does nothing. On Task Manager, it says Not Responding for the process with the name gzserver.
Thanks in advance!

A:

gzserver is waiting for a connection.
(It doesn't service a message loop which is why it appears to be hung.)
Try launching it through ROS:
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch
