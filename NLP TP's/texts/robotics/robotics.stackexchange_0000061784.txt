Q:

launch lisp REPL error

I was trying one of the first CRAM tutorial and it says 'launch lisp REPL.'
I have installed roslisp but when i run 'rosrun roslisp_repl repl' as the roslisp tutorial says to do, I get "[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named repl below /opt/ros/groovy/share/roslisp_repl"
Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
Btw, I am using Ros Groovy on ubuntu 12.04.
Thanks!

Does that directory exist? What files does it contain?

A:

You were using an old version of the roslisp tutorial, I suggest to always refer to the original wiki.rog.org pages instead of mirrors. If you installed roslisp_repl from source then the command would be
$ rosrun roslisp_repl roslisp_repl

otherwise it's simply
$ roslisp_repl

You can find the original tutorial here

Note: I guess it's too late to answer this question now (my email subscription filter didn't work as expected so I missed this, sorry) but as I didn't find any guidelines on how old a question should be not to revive it, I'm putting an answer here in any case for future reference.
