Q:

is there a way for object detection or recognition with 2d laser scanner?

Hello,
I have lms100 laser scanner and i want to do any kind of object or obstacle detection/recognition. Is there anyway to do that with help of ROS?
By the way, currently I can create map with hector_slam with LMS100.
edit: i think costmap can show obstacles. but i'm not sure, it can apply to my situtation (having only laser scanner not a robot system)
Thanks, Basak

A:

There is a package for your scanner within ROS from here
Then you can look for available source code, problems/solutions.. etc

I am using that LMS1xx driver package for hector_slam already. But didnt understand your answer

I didn't know that you already have a package, so my answer was about that package and the second link is about a problem related to your scanner, from it you can get some information

so your answer is not an answer for my question :/ Do you know what should i do for obstacle detection, avoidance?

Sorry I didn't work with this sensor before, but I would recommend you to use the hashtag #hector_slam:
http://answers.ros.org/questions/scope:all/sort:activity-desc/tags:hector_slam/page:1/
And check what people asking about and what they do..etc
