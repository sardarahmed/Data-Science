Q:

DWB local planner footprint configuration

Hi everyone,
I have some issues while trying to use DWB local planner.
I'm using it with move_base using this answer.
But when I start the navigation, I get these errors:
[ WARN] [1464825005.450915057]: Critic "ObstacleFootprint" failed to prepare
[ERROR] [1464825005.457386149]: computeVelocityCommands exception: No valid trajectories out of 63! 
[ERROR] [1464825005.550973984]: Footprint spec is empty, maybe missing call to setFootprint?

I've tried to add in my "base_local_planner_params.yaml" file the "ObstacleFootprint" parameter :
  critics:
     ObstacleFootprint: [[-0.3, 0.45], [0.97, 0.45], [0.97, -0.45], [-0.3,-0.45]]

But now, my robot goes around in circles with no errors instead of moving towards the destination...
Thanks for your help!

A:

DWB searches for the footprint here
You'll want to set the footprint parameter somewhere in your namespace. Right now, I'm guessing you have the parameter /move_base/DWBLocalPlanner/critics/ObstacleFootprint set to the footprint above. What you want is for the footprint to be set anywhere in those namespaces, including

/footprint
/move_base/footprint
/move_base/DWBLocalPlanner/footprint
/move_base/DWBLocalPlanner/critics/footprint
/move_base/DWBLocalPlanner/critics/ObstacleFootprint/footprint

/move_base/footprint is traditional, since it allows anything in move_base to use the same footprint.

I had it there:
/move_base/global_costmap/footprint
/move_base/local_costmap/footprint

So I added it too in:
/move_base/footprint

And it works... Thanks a lot!

I'm quite new to this, could you explain how exactly you did this? I have the same error.
