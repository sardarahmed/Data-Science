Q:

Is there a way how to transfer a model inside simulation from ROS node?

I'm writing some automatic simulation testing and it would be helpful if I could just move the robot at it's initial position after each test instead of running the whole simulation again. How can I do that?

A:

You can send a Gazebo message to the "/gazebo/default/model/modify" topic. See the message definition here.
In the gazebo/gui/ModelListWidget.cc you have an example of how to publish some data towards that topic. See here.
