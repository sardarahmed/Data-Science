Q:

ROS Groovy install error "Debian & Sources"

Hello,
I am the newbie of ROS, and i want to install it in Debian (acctually Mint Debian) by using source and compile it. I just follow the wiki "Installation/Source", and when I doing:

./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install

there comes errors when compile PCL. The link errors shows missing some library like:

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsensor_msgs 
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lroscpp_serialization 
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrosconsole 
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lrostime

but actually these libs are compiled by catkin_make_isolated before, and there's no error compile them. I cd into "devel_isolated" directory, found rostime, rosconsole, roscpp_serialization, sensor_msgs are existed and there is a "lib" subdirectory in them.
How can I deal with these errors?
BTW, sorry for my poor English :)
