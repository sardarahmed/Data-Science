Q:

Guidelines for a "stopwatch based" craft

I'm a swimmer and would like to create a small object that would help me folow my trainning plannification.
In other words I want to create a custum stopwatch, with 5 colored led that will be on or off according to the trainning program.
This is my training:

0:00 to 5:00 : Low Effort (Green light)
5:00 to 15:00 : Medium Effort (Yellow light)
15:00 to 20:00 : High Effort (Orange Light)
20:00 to 25:00 : Medium Effort (Yellow light)
25:00 to 26:00 : Maximum Effort (Red light)
26:00 to 30:00 :  Low Effort (Green light)
30:00 Trainning done (Should turn off automaticaly.)

The whole thing must be waterproof.
Must work on battery.
I'm asking for some guidelines, I'm not asking for a complete patent(would be appreciated though) but the main idea how to do it. So I can avoid wasting my time on research and tests.
I don't want to spend too much time on the project less than 100 hours maybe. I have studied in computer science and I have most of the materials I'll need. I can buy what is missing.
I'm a little bit noob on this kind of project, I want to know how you do it.
Thanks for help.

A:

That should be doable and is not that hard. I suggest a small arduino (e.g. Adafruit Trinket), an (RGB LED), a small coin cell and a button. The coding is trivial. You attach this components to a replacement watchstrap so that you can wear it on the wrist. You can activate the system with the button and show your lights. Making it watertight is not that easy, I'd start with transparent heat shrink tube after fixing everything in epoxy. The battery should last some time, replacing it will be a bit tricky.  
Update: You could even get rid of the button if you let two metal parts stick out so that they are connected electrically by the water.
