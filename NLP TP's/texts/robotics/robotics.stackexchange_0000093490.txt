Q:

Sphero robot don't move when I publish in cmd_vel topic

Hello!
I try to make a project using sphero robot simulation(gazebo) from this source: Sphero-ROS.
I run the command: roslaunch sphero_gazebo main.launch to start gazebo.
After that I tried to move the robot by keyboard, running the next command in other terminal: roslaunch sphero_gazebo  keyboard_teleop.launch. But when I pres the control keys, the robot do not respond.
I tried also to move the robot by terminal running:
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
  x: 1.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 10.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0" 

But did't work. I do not receive any error in console. How can I solve this?
I am using ROS Kinetic.
edit:
I tried to echo the /cmd_vel topic in one terminal and in the second one I published using the command above and everything looks like working but the robot don't move.

A:

Within your main.launch there is the argument pause defined like this :
  <arg name="pause" default="true"/>

That means that you are launching Gazebo in mode pause. You can either modify this in the launch file or launch it with specifying the argument pause in command line :
roslaunch sphero_gazebo main.launch pause:=false
