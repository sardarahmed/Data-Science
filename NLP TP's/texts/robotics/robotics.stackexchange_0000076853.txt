Q:

Consume a service from a Master node

Hello!
I want to consume a service running in a computer from another computer in the same network. Is this possible?
I have set up ROS_MASTER_URI correctly on both, I know its correct since I was able to do the talker/listener example from the tutorials.
If I run roscore and the service from the basic tutorial:
rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server.py

and this on the client computer:
rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_client.py

I get nothing.
Does anybody know what could be wrong?
Thanks in advance.
EDIT: One runs the server and one runs the client, I do not have the server running on both computers.

You should only need one copy of the server node; why are you running it on both computers?

Just to clarify: @ahendrix asks why you run add_two_ints_server.py on both your server and your client. You write: "I get nothing", but that makes sense, as the servers will just sit there, waiting for a client to connect, which you don't start.

Im sorry, I typed in both the same script, but one of those should be running a client. I edited my post to address this. Thanks.

A:

you need to specify the input arguments : the two numbers that you're going to add, when calling the client.
