Q:

Moveit limited full joints explanation

I'm running the moveit launch files at https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot. The last set of instructions have the following instructions:

As MoveIt! seems to have difficulties
with finding plans for the UR with
full joint limits [-2pi, 2pi], there
is a joint_limited version using joint
limits restricted to [-pi,pi].

Can someone please help me understand what that means?
