Q:

Catkinized KnowRob - dependency issues

I've installed the new catkinized KnowRob under Hydro, following the instructions and the very useful migration guide, and everything seems to be working.
However I had a couple of minor issues with dependencies: first, rosdep doesn't seem to install dependencies recursively, so some were missed (e.g. see http://answers.ros.org/question/84616/help-understanding-system-and-package-dependencies-with-rosbuild-and-catkin/).
I suggest instead of doing
rosdep install --ignore-src knowrob

you can use
rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths stacks/

Secondly, a few packages are referenced in knowrob_addons but aren't present in the git repo, specifically:

knowrob_motion_constraints missing knowrob_mesh_reasoning
semantic_map_to_owl missing semantic_map_to_owl_msgs
knowrob_cad_models missing iai_cad_tools (for iai_cad_downloader -- which I tried installing, but then it seemed to need access to a private SVN repository)

A:

Thanks for reporting these issues! I have addressed them in the wiki and repository:

Updated documentation with new rosdep command
knowrob_mesh_reasoning is in the knowrob_dev repository that has been made public recently. I have removed the '-all' installation variant, please use the '-dev' variant to get the complete set of KnowRob repositories.
The dependency on semantic_map_to_owl_msgs was outdated and has been removed.
The CAD model downloader erroneously referred to the internal URL of the repository and has been changed to use the public one by default.
