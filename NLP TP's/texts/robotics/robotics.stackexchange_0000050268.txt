Q:

Error while trying to save full map as .pcd or keyframes

Hi,
I have a problem with ccny_rgbd: everything run smooth and in real time,
but everytime I call the save_pcd_map service I get this error:
ERROR: service [/save_pcd_map] responded with an error: [pcl::PCDWriter::writeBinary] Error during open!

Instead with save_keyframes service I get the following error:
ERROR: service [/save_keyframes] responded with an error: boost::filesystem::create_directory: No such file or directory: "~/my_keyframe_sequence/0000"

I'm running it under ubuntu 12.10 and ros-groovy, any advice is welcome.

A:

Apologies for the late answer
This error occurs when the program cannot create the directory. I'm not sure whether the boost function I use plays nice with the "~" character. Try it will the full path.
The other problem could be that the directory exists already.
It's not very clean behavior - feel free to opn a ticket and I'll try to revise it.
