Q:

TF doesn't work even though it's in the tf_tree

Hi,
I need a tf between world and map.
This is my starting situation (world and map are not connected):

Now I establish a simple static transform:

The two tf_trees are now connected:

BUT somehow there is still no connection between /world /base_footprint:

Rviz is complaining about a missing tf as well.
How can I fix this?
Any hints for further investigation?

A:

Your transforms have timestamps that are offset by on the order of 400 seconds which means that there's no valid time to query across the spanning set that you're looking for.
Unrelated, but best practice is to have a tree, not keep inserting parents above map or world.

Wow, you are right haven't noticed!  I don't want to mess with trasnforms below map. Therefore I somehow need to push the world/map transform in the past. Do you know how to do that?

You should make sure that all the computers in your system have synchronized clocks. https://answers.ros.org/question/11570/ros-time-across-machines/
