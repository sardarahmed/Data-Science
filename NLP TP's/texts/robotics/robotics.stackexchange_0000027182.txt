Q:

simulation of broken objectes in gazebo

Hello everybody :)
Can we simulate broken objects ? for example if we have a revolute joint between two boxes. And something more solid and heavy fall over, will the joint be broken ?
thanks in advance

Hi,
you can detach a joint when a given limit is reached (e.g. force).
Here is the source of an example plugin.
Cheers,
Andrei
