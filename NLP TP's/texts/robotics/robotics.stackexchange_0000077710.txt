Q:

catkin_make with common_msgs as a dependency

I want to use some of the common_msgs in a ROS node I'm working on so used catkin_create_pkg with common_msgs as a dependency (Similar to what is done in the simple publisher subscriber with std_msgs)
I get the following error when running catkin_make
-- Could not find the required component 'common_msgs'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "common_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    common_msgsConfig.cmake
    common_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "common_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "common_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "common_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  ZenithObstacleDetector/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

I made sure common_msgs is installed and used roscd to enter it. It only contains a package.xml file.
Here's the package I'm working on https://github.com/iscumd/ZenithObstacleDetector
I've commented out the find common_msgs so it builds
Here's the workspace https://github.com/iscumd/Zenith2017/tree/master/catkin_ws

A:

common_msgs is the metapackage, not a package that contains any files itself (other than a package manifest).
You should depend on the package(s) that actually contain the message/service/action specs that you'd like to use (ie, any of: actionlib_msgs, diagnostic_msgs, geometry_msgs, nav_msgs, sensor_msgs, shape_msgs, stereo_msgs, trajectory_msgs or visualization_msgs).

Thank you, I realized I could include the sensor_msgs on it's own but didn't realize this was the "correct" way to do it.
