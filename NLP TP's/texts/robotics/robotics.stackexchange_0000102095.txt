Q:

Interactive markers not showing in RViz

I'm trying to display a cube interactive marker using the interactive_marker_tutorials (have to build from source). Running the cube example:
ros2 run interactive_marker_tutorials cube

Then, running rviz:
rviz2

Add an interactive marker display with namespace set to cube, and RViz spams the following and the interactive marker doesn't show:

A:

The issue is due to no TF data to transform the interactive marker's in the base_link frame to the map frame RViz is trying to display.
Simply change the Fixed Frame to base_link in RViz:
