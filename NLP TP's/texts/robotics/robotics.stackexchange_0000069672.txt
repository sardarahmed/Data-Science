Q:

[rospack] Error: package 'image_view' not found

Hi
I use ubuntu14.04 on Raspberry Pi 2
I installed ros-indigo-desktop
I ran the following command
$ roscore 
$ rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw

rosrun image_view image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw caused an error
[rospack] Error: package 'image_view' not found

Please give me some advice

A:

Do you have image_view installed?
Try sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-image-view.
