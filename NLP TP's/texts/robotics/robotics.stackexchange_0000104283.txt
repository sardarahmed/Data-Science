Q:

navigation on rugged terrain

I use ROS2/Python/Gazebo.
I need navigation (and mapping) for a tractor on a hill: a rugged surface, so to speak.
I can of course project everything on a flat map, but distances will shrink and I think localization and path planning will begin making errors.
So, questions:

What the 2.5d map should be? Triangles mesh instead of plane? Is there a standard?
How to SLAM it all (and again, what is the output format)?
And how to navigate it?

Thank you.

A:

The map input is generally a mesh, gradient, or 3d costmap (per the nav2 'concepts' doc). There's some discussion on how to bring this functionality to ROS 2 into the widely-used Nav2 stack (e.g., here), and potentially some third-party support via Kimera here. But it doesn't look like it's fully integrated/implemented at this point in time.
In ROS 1, there isn't official support, but there is a community-driven alternative to move_base called move_base_flex. They take mesh maps as an input, and are backwards-compatible with move_base. It's documented here, source code for move_base_flex is here, the mesh_navigation package is here, and tutorials are here. There's talk of bringing move_base_flex to ROS 2 here, but nothing concrete just yet.
