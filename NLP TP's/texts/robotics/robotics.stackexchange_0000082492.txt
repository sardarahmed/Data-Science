Q:

How to know which package is being used when two packages with same name are installed at different location?

Hi,
I have installed Hokuyo_node deprecated version from github. I already have Hokuyo_node installed while installing ROS. Now, when I use rosun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node, how do I make sure which package is being used?
thanks,

A:

rospack find hokuyo_node will tell you which package path it's using. The directories that ROS tools use to search for packages are listed in $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, which is typically set by the setup.bash file in your workspace.
