Q:

Cannot create trajectory from message. It does not contain the expected joints

Command I run in terminal:
$ roslaunch tiago_gazebo tiago_gazebo.launch public_sim:=true robot:=steel

$ rostopic pub /arm_controller/command trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: ''
joint_names:
- 'arm_1_joint'
points:
- positions: [0.5]
  velocities: [0]
  accelerations: [0]
  effort: [0]
  time_from_start: {secs: 1, nsecs: 0}" 

Result from terminal:
[ERROR] [1493904854.162621476, 91.554000000]: Cannot create trajectory from message. It does not contain the expected joints.

However I can see from gazebo simulator there is arm_1_joint by expanding the model of tiago_steel.
How could I solve this problem?

A:

The controller you are using is this.
if allow_partial_joints_goal: True is not set your have to specify all of the joints in de arm_controller.
Like:
$ rostopic pub -1 /arm_controller/command trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
     secs: 0
     nsecs: 0
  frame_id: ''
joint_names: [arm_1_joint, arm_2_joint, arm_3_joint, arm_4_joint, arm_5_joint, arm_6_joint, arm_7_joint]
points:
- positions: [0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  time_from_start: {secs: 1, nsecs: 0}"

I have sent joint values from csv file yet i get this error. Please help. I have also set the above constraint true
PS: Only joint 1 and 2 of my robot can be detected
