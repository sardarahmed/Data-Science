what is the difference in insert and push_back
MarkerArray ma;
MarkerArray mark;
ma.markers.insert(ma.makers.end(), mark.makers.begin(), mark.markers.end());
vs
ma.markers.push_back(mark);

I usually work in python, but it might be that push_back can be in loop easier than your insert line, or that push_back is faster. Could also be neither
