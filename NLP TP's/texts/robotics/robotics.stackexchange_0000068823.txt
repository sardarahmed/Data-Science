Hector Visualization Cmake error

Hi guys, I got this cmake error when building hector_visualization pacakge:
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'rqt_video_playback'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(hector_visualization/rqt_video_playback)
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:91 (MESSAGE):
  Could NOT find Qt4 (missing: QT_PHONON_INCLUDE_DIR QT_PHONON_LIBRARY)
  (found version "4.8.1")
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:252 (_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE)
  /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindQt4.cmake:1171 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  hector_visualization/rqt_video_playback/CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package)

Anybody got a solution to this one? Thanks a lot!

A:

hector_visualization requires Qt4 to be installed.
Seems you don't have this.
So install Qt4. I'm not sure which is included where, but I guess doing a sudo apt-get install qt4-designer will pull in all you need.
Probably you'll also need to sudo apt-get install phonon as this seems to be required as well. But I currently have no machine to test this.

Duh, just tried it on a new install. Found the problem (hopefully).
You compile against phonon, so you obviously need the development library libphonon-dev, not just the runtime library... My bad for not checking this earlier.

Hi there! Thanks for getting back! I have already installed qt4-designer and phonon (updated too). But this error still occurs.

Can you please give some more information? Which OS/ROS-distro? Which branch from the hector_visualization package? Modified anything?
Comment by psprox96 on 2015-07-24:
Thanks for the reply. I'm using Groovy and the package is a groovy devel branch. I didn't modify anything of the code inside. The problem seems to be due to the line 11 in CMakeList.txt (you linked that, thanks!). Maybe I have to edit so the packages from QT4 and Phonon can be found?

Updated the answer above (even before you're reply ;-) ). You need to install libphonon-dev.

Wow! Thanks, I got it working already. You are a genius!
