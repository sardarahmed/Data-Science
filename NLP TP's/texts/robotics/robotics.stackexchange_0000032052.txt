Q:

TF message arrays

I want to publish some sort of location data but in unknown quantities. I use some sort of vision algorithm to find items in scene I want to publish 0...n found items in single message. So I can compare this set to one found in next frame or message.
Vector3Stamped.msg looks mostly what I need but I change definition "Vector3 vector" to "Vector3[] vector".
Question is, if TF is able to handle the situation and provide conversion without hassle? As much I understand, TF knows some datatypes and provides easy conversion on them. Can it understand arrays? Current situation:
tonu@hp:~/TYROS/tyros_camera$ cat msg/Objects.msg 
Header header
Object[] object

tonu@hp:~/TYROS/tyros_camera$ cat msg/Object.msg 
geometry_msgs/Vector3 vector
float32 certainity
string type

tonu@hp:~/TYROS/tyros_camera$

A:

The standard TF methods do not support arrays of messages.  You can easily write a wrapper methods which has a for loop to do so.
