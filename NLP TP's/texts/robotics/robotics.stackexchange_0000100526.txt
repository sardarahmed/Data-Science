Q:

Installing ROS2 python version

Hello,
I'm trying to install ROS2 Crystal on the machine which already has ROS Melodic. I follow the standard guide https://docs.ros.org/en/crystal/Installation/Linux-Install-Binary.html
At the step 'Installing the missing dependencies', when I try to run rosdep install it gives the following warning
WARNING: ROS_PYTHON_VERSION is unset. Defaulting to 2
I've tried to set it manually  with ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3 but the warning persists. Will this break installation in some way? How do I set it to python3?
