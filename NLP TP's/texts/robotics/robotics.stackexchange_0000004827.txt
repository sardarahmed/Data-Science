Q:

NAO motor model identification

I am trying to create a model for the NAO [robot]'s motors. The figure below shows the step response for the knee motor. Afaik the NAO internally uses a pid controller to control the motor. I have no control over the pid or it's parameters. Thus I would like to treat the motor including pid as a black box. Theoretically it should be possible to model pid+motor as a $pt_2$ system, i.e. a second order lti system.
A $pt_2$ system is defined by the following differential equation:
$$T^2\ddot{y}(t) + 2dT\dot{y}(t)+y(t) = Ku(t)$$.
I tried fitting a $pt_2$ model but was unable to find good parameters.
Any idea what model to use for this kind of step response?
edit:
I tried modifying the equation to add a maximum joint velocity like this:
$$T^2\ddot{y}(t) + (\frac{2dT\dot{y}(t) + m - |2dT\dot{y}(t) - m|}{2})+y(t) = Ku(t)$$ 
where $m$ is the maximum velocity. The fraction should be equivalent to $min(2dT\dot{y}(t), m)$.
However I am not sure if this is the correct way to introduce a maximum joint velocity. The optimizer is unable to find good parameters for the limited velocity formula. I am guessing that is because the min() introduces an area where parameter changes do not cause any optimization error changes.

A:

Try something like:
if(angle'> max)
    angle'=max
else if(angle'< min)
    angle'=min
end

Try 0.1 (and -0.1) for the max velocity of the servo, I came up with that value from the graph you showed.
