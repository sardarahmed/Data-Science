The same way you would install any other released package. What ROS distro are you using? Where did you get it?

A:

In the section titled Adding Released Packages, include uuid_msgs in the rosinstall_generator command, along with any other released packages you use:
$ rosinstall_generator uuid_msgs ros_comm ros_control joystick_drivers --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only --exclude roslisp --tar > indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall
