Q:

Meaning of 'sign' in Writhe Matrix

Following is the equation of Writhe matrix from the article Topology based Representation(page no. 6).

What is the meaning of 'sign' in the second part of this equation? I am not sure if this is some typo in that article as the other article of Hierarchical Motion Planning(page no. 3), compleletely neglects the term 'sign[...]'

A:

Sign is a function that returns +1 whenever the operand is anything positive, -1 if it's anything negative, and 0 if it's zero. I'm not sure if it's mathematically correct for your equation as I'm not familiar with it, but it's not an uncommon function, especially in the realm of robotics.
