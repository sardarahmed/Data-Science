Q:

Problem using ur5/ur10 with moveit in indigo

Hello,
I was using the universal robot package with ros hydro on ubuntu 12.04. I felt like it was time to upgrade my linux and ros versions. I am now running ros indigo on ubuntu 14.04.
When I try to use the moveit planner with a UR10, no solutions are found... Can anybody help ? Thank you.

A:

This could perhaps be a recently reported issue with MoveIt under Indigo. See this moveit-users post for more info, and ros-industrial/universal_robot#156 for some candidate changes to work around/solve this.
Could you try those changes out and see if things start working for you?
