Q:

How to specify yaw in a ROS launch file?

Hi,
I'm having trouble getting my robot to face the right direction when it is spawned in the Gazebo world. Here's what I have in my launch file:
<node name="spawn_urdf" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" output="screen"
      args="-urdf -model clearpath_jackal -param robot_description -x 0 -y -10 -z 1.0 -Y 1.5708" />

Note that I'm trying to use the -Y argument to specify yaw but when I launch Gazebo the robot is always facing the same way, regardless of what value I specify.
Can anybody make any suggestions?

Hi,
I have already tested with Gazebo 9 and ROS Noetic and it's working

I run this bash script
for i in 0 1 2 3 4
do
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -urdf -file model.urdf -x $i -y 0 -z 3.0 -reference_frame world -model drone$i -Y $i
done

can you provide more details? which Gazebo and ROS version are you using?

Thanks for this. I've played around with your script and it seems to be working fine now with my originally posted launch code.....not sure what happened!
