How to compile the /gazebo-8.0.0/examples/stand_alone/custom_main/custom_main.cc without install gazebo from source? Is there an example?  Thanks.

A:

It would be good for every example to have a README. These are the instructions:
# Build
cd <path to>/examples/stand_alone/custom_main
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
# Run
./custom_main
