Q:

catkin_make turotial error

Hi all,
I was going through the ROS tutorials. After making the catkin workspace:
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace

I try to run catkin_make as explained in tutorial:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make

How ever I got an error msg :
ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.topological_order import topological_order" failed: No module named cmake
Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.
python-catkin-pkg is installed and up-to-date. Also when I run $PYTHONPATH I get:
bash: /opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages: Is a directory
I removed and reinstall ROS but didnt have any effect. I use ROS groovy and ubuntu 12.04.
How I fix this?
Thanks

Did you install ROS using apt-get?

Which tutorial are you doing? What ones have you already done?

I have done the old beginner tutorials and now I am going through new beginner tutorials with catkin. Yes I have installed ROS using apt-get

Is this the tutorial you are doing? http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu. Have you initialized rosdep and source setup.bash?
Comment by Manolis on 2013-07-19:
Gustav, yes , I started from the installation and then gone to tutorials. I have initialized rosdep and sourced the setup.bash. Also I run rosdep update. but I get this:  ERROR: unable to process source [https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/groovy.yaml]:

Failed to download target platform data for gbpdistro:
HTTP Error 404: Not Found

A:

Since I couldnâ€™t find any other solution I just removed Linux partition and reinstalled everything (Ubuntu 12.04, ROS etc).
Now it works.
