A:

You have not installed ros_vrpn_client.  It is pretty old and hasn't been released to the Debs.  You will need to compile from source.  I believe this is the most update to date fork.  You could also try to use mocap_optitrack if working with a Optitrack setup.

Thanks for the quick reply.
I have installed ros_vrpn_client and compiled the source using install_vrpn.sh.
I have tried using mocap_optitrack package but still i am gettng Package mocap_optitrack_master not found.
Could you please explain me in brief, actual I am very new to this development.

The package name should me mocap_optitrack and you should use the launch file to load the parameters.
