Q:

Update Problem, Error: is not a package or launch file name

Hi,
everything was OK before I did update.
After update of ROS packages the ROS Groovy not work or give me the following message:
[move_monsun] is not a package or launch file name when I use the lanch file 

roslaunch move_monsun move_monsun.launch
<launch>
    <group ns="monsun"> 
      <node pkg="move_monsun" name="PID_Move" type="move_monsun_node" output="screen">
    <param name="k_p" value="1.0" type="double"/>
    <param name="k_i" value="0.0" />
    <param name="k_d" value="0.0" />
    <param name="k_pl" value="1.0" type="double"/>
    <param name="k_il" value="0.0" />
    <param name="k_dl" value="0.0" />
    <param name="i_max" value="0.0" />
    <param name="output_min" value="-60.0" />
    <param name="output_max" value="60.0" />
    <param name="output_minl" value="-40.0" />
    <param name="output_maxl" value="40.0" />
     </node>
    </group>
</launch>

I am sure, I don't make any change in path of ros_workspace. I am run for the same packages before the update and they work  and after the update don't work.
I'm sure I did not do to change anything in the my files only I've update for my ROS_packages.
I tred rosmake agin for the same packges and I get the follwing:
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

In my .bashrc there the path of ROS
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
export ROS_WORKSPACE=~/ros_workspace 

And roscd is working.
Any ideas
thanks

Is it still not working ? Did you try to reinstall everything from scratch ?
Comment by underwater on 2013-07-11:
Yes, I install fresh ROS and I get the same problem.May be the problem in path of ROS but I written as above.
Comment by Lucile on 2013-07-11:
Did you check rosdep version ? Command line is rosdep --version I had the same kind of problems as yours with a new ROS install and it apparently came from the fact that rosdep wasn't up to date.

( 0.10.21 version)
Comment by Lucile on 2013-07-11:
Ok, rosdep is ok then. But I do not think you have to add ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and ROS_WORKSPACE to your .bashrc since some other files are called from setup.bash to set them up. Plus, the path you set for ROS_PACKAGE_PATH seems wrong to me because it doesn't lead to stacks and share folders.
Comment by underwater on 2013-07-11:
My path ros_workspace is /home/amory/ros_workspace
Comment by underwater on 2013-07-11:
And in .bashrc is the follwing :source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
export ROS_WORKSPACE=~/ros_workspace
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. What is wrong ?
Comment by Lucile on 2013-07-12:
My mistake. I mixed up ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and ROS_WORKSPACE. It doesn't seem to come from your path definition. Seems like your problem is somewhere deeper in your ROS system. Maybe some tool is broken ?

Please stop 'updating' your question to push it to the top!
Comment by felix k on 2013-07-21:
Obviously, the aren't any ideas. Be more precise, post the exact directory layout with important files, place a echo $ROS.. right with the roslaunch etc. You are using a rosbuild package, right? Do you have a CATKIN_IGNORE file in your package?
Comment by underwater on 2013-07-21:
/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks:/home/amory/ros_workspace
Comment by underwater on 2013-07-21:
yes I ues rosbuild package and I don't have a CATKIN_IGNORE file in my package
Comment by felix k on 2013-07-21:
Uhm, with the export lines you posted the path could not result to what you posted above. Please ensure your question. - And run roswtf from inside your package.

I could confirm that. With the update my rosbuild package I had used make eclipse-project with broke launching and removing CATKIN_IGNORE helped.
