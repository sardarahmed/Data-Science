Q:

Gazebo Hokuyo laser not working properly

Hi all,
I´m trying to run some mapping experiments with a mobile robot on a Ubuntu 16.04 machine with ROS Kinetic and Gazebo 7.
What I did was to define a diff-drive with the following urdf:
https://github.com/JoseJaramillo/lucrezio_simulation_environments/blob/master/urdf/lucrezio.urdf.xacro
and then, to run the simulation I use this launch file:
https://github.com/JoseJaramillo/lucrezio_simulation_environments/blob/master/launch/robot.launch
by doing so, I get a strange behavior, that is, the robot is loaded correctly but from the laser scan it seems that it´s not able to sense objects:

Can you please explain me what could be the problem, please?
Thanks!

A:

Try the using the non-GPU version of the laser.

Hello! I did that, it didn't work as expected.
However, I solved it by reinstalling-updating the NVIDIA drivers. works like a champ! Thank you anyway!
