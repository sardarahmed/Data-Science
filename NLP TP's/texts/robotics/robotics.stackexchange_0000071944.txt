Q:

Displaying trajectories on rviz

I am writing my own implementation of a local planner which generates 7 trajectories and choose one of them. I want to display all the 7 trajectories on rviz each time the local planner is invoked along with the trajectory chosen with a different colour. How to do it in ROS ?

A:

This is what Markers are made for. The Tutorial on Points and Lines should be a good stating point, as it is pretty similar to your application.
