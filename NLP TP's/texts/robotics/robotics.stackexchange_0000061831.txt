Q:

How to make a launch file?

Now let's create a launch file called turtlemimic.launch and paste the following:
I pull up gedit and copy/paste    1 
2
3   
4     
5   
6
7   
8     
9   
10
11   
12     
13     
14   
15
16 
into gedit with sudo and save it at /home/pc/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/launch
I $ cd ~/catkin_ws/   source devel/setup.bash
then I try to run roslaunch beginner_tutorials turtlemimic.launch
but i get the error
pc@pc:~$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
pc@pc:~/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash
pc@pc:~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch beginner_tutorials turtlemimic.launch
... logging to /home/pc/.ros/log/93f61492-23a7-11e4-bf9f-9439e5ec40e7/roslaunch-pc-3090.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: syntax error: line 1, column 3I
I don't know what im doing wrong, the file will only save as plain text and not XML, the tutorial does not say how to save files in XML

Please use the code block formatting tool. It's the button with the 101010 in it. I always have to edit your questions to avoid eye cancer.

Thanks for formatting my question, it looks ok when I put it in the question box but changes when it's posted. I have searched and I can't find out what a CODE BLOCK tool is. What is the button with 101010 and if all of this is important why is it not in the tutorial, it says beginner level. I am not playing dumb I really don't know what this stuff is.

Do you really want to do robotics? The ROS tutorials are very easy and compared to real robotics a child's play.

YES, I will get the hang of it just like anything else hard in life the more you do it the better you get. How was I suppose to know that I don't include the line numbers, the tutorial said copy and paste, I find it funny you asked about spam.

A:

Don't copy-paste the line numbers from the tutorial page.
You always can disable the line numbers in ROS wiki code examples.

Thank you so much, it works now. I don't understand why the tutorial does not tell me that.
