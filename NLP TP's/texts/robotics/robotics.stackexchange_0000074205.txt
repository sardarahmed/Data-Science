Q:

problem with openNI and openNI2 not locating ASUS Xtion

Hey, I would like to ask for help on using my ASUS Xtion camera on my Clearpath Jackal with openni or openni2. When i turn on the jackal and try to view raw image data, I can view an image very well. The problem is that when I try to open openni and openni2, the following error appears:
[ INFO] [1464705771.982015207]: No matching device found.... waiting for devices. Reason: std::string openni2_wrapper::OpenNI2Driver::resolveDeviceURI(const string&) @ /tmp/binarydeb/ros-indigo-openni2-camera-0.2.6/src/openni2_driver.cpp @ 631 : Invalid device number 1, there are 0 devices connected.

It seems like it is trying to find a device (my camera), and never finds it. I also ran lsusb to see if my camera showed up, and what I got was this:
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 004: ID 192f:0916 Avago Technologies, Pte. 
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 046d:c31c Logitech, Inc. Keyboard K120
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

I see no ASUS written as one of the bus drives (as suggested in http://answers.ros.org/question/191630/problem-with-openni2_camera-primesense-not-detected/)
I have followed this procedure that was also suggested to me : http://robotica.unileon.es/mediawiki/index.php/PCL/OpenNI_troubleshooting#No_device_found_.2F_No_devices_connected, but it also did not work.
Let me know if anyone has any tips on how to fix this with my ASUS Xtion. Thanks :)
EDIT 1: I did lsusb while i was ssh'ed into my jackal and my ASUS actually showed up on the list, so I am starting to think that I have to run the openni from my robot's computer, is that true?

If the system is not detecting it, it doesn't look good. Have you tried it in another computer? You should also check dmesg to see if there was some problem when detecting the device.

Openni will launch the device driver, which will try to connect to a physical address in the computer it is running. So yes, you should definitely launch openni in the same computer that has the camera plugged in.

A:

Do you happen to be using a USB 3.0 port?  I know that XTION devices have to undergo a firmware upgrade in order to work on a USB 3.0 port.  (even the USB 2.0 devices)
