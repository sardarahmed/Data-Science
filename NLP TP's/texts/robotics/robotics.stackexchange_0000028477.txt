Q:

"gzserver: symbol lookup error" when launching Gazebo in Ubuntu 16.04

I have just installed ROS kinetic and Gazebo 7.12.0 in Ubuntu 16.04. When I launch gazebo from terminal I get the following error:
gzserver: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsdformat.so.4: undefined symbol: _ZN8ignition4math15SemanticVersionC1ERKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE

and Gazebo won't start.
The strange thing is that if I launch the Turtlebot simulation roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch Gazebo starts correctly without raising any error. Any idea on why this is happening?

I solved a similar problem using the solution here - https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/2448/problem-running-gazebo7
Check if that solves it.
