Q:

rosmake + make test? Automated testing?

I am wondering how I could automate the build of my unit tests.
Because right now I have to call make test in every package.
But I would like to automate this, to build for every package that has a test in it.
Something like a rosmake command for testing would be ideal.
Or can I add something to the makefile, so rosmake will also build the test?

A:

Ok, I should have searched for rosmake options. ;-)
There is a command rosmake [PACKAGE] -t that builds and tests the package.
But it calls make test only for the package specified and not for the packages it depends on...
