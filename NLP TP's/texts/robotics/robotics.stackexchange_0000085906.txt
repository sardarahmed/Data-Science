Q:

Can I use gmapping without publishing the map in /map?

I am using gmapping but I do not want to publish the map on the topic /map so is there any thing I can do to modify it?

A:

My guess is that you want to publish your map on a DIFFERENT topic name rather than /map? If so, you can easily remap it.
However, if you don't want to publish your map at all, comment out line 767,768 in your gmapping package.
