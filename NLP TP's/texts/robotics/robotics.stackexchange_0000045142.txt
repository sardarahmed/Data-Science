Q:

modify the URDF and kinect position turtlebot

Is there a easy way to modify the URDF file for a turtlebot roomba (metric)?
I need to change the kinect position and also the inertia as i dont use the baseplates. Not really sure how this is done however, is it possible to manually edit the urdf file? If so where is it positioned?
many thanks

A:

The urdf of the turtlebot is placed under turtlebot/turtlebot/desription/urdf/.
There are different xacro files.
When I remeber correctly the main file is turtlebot.urdf.xacro which includes the other ones (you will see it in the xml code)
You can get help for editing under http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf. You don't have to build the urdf explicitly it is normally done in the launch file via xacro.
