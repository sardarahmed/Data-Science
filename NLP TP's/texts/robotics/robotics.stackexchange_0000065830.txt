Q:

roslaunch "include" in a new terminal

Hi all,
with "include" I can call a "launch" file from another one, but is there a way to run it in a new term window?
We can make it with "launch-prefix="xterm -e"" for a node...

A:

If you want them in different terminals I suggest multiple instances of roslaunch. The xml gets evaulated and then subprocesses are run and monitored individually.
