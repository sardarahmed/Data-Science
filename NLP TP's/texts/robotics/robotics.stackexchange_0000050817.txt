Q:

pr2_interactive_manipulation_desktop.launch is missing on groovy

Hi,
I tried to test pr2_marker_control package following wiki tutorial[1], but could not find
pr2_interactive_manipulation_desktop.launch file under pr2_interactive_manipulation package.
The file is missing? or the wiki is incorrect?
[1] www.ros.org wiki pr2_marker_control (sorry that I don't have enough karma to post url)

A:

It looks like the pr2_interactive_manipulation_desktop.launch file has moved into the pr2_interactive_manipulation_frontend package.
