Q:

Implementing path constraints for Moveit in python

I have a 6 DOF arm and it has been interfaced with moveit. Now I want to move the arm from  point A to point B with one of the joint having a orientation constraint throughout the path. There are already solutions in C++ but I need a solution in python. Has anyone already tried in python? Kindly help me to move ahead.

I made a manipulator on my own.

A:

The MoveGroupCommander (one of the python classes for interfacing with MoveIt) provides a set_path_constraints function that should set the constraints for the next planning performed through that class.

I had a look at that but do you have any sample code implemented that previously.

I'm not aware of tutorial code that demonstrates this, no.
You are invited to contribute some here. :-)
