Q:

Installing WebUI with proper Environmental Variables

I'm trying to install the web interface on my laptop. I've gotten things to work after a little tweaking (which I updated on the wiki), so that I get through the whole installation process.
However, when I open a browser, I get this error message.

MOD_PYTHON ERROR
ProcessId:      6630
Interpreter:    '127.0.0.1'

ros_root = os.environ['ROS_ROOT']

raise KeyError(key)
KeyError: 'ROS_ROOT'

Clearly, ROS_ROOT is not being set properly. Any ideas where to set this variable so that the Webui picks up on it? Currently, I believe it is being set through  setup.bash.

Stopping apache and then relaunching the webui fixed the problem.
