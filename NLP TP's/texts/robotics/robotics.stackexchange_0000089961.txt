Q:

hx711 python library; ROS node; name 'rospy' is not defined

Hello !
I am trying to read a load sensor on raspberry pi having Ubuntu Mate with ROS Kinetic. I am using the library link text. However when I create a catkin package and insert the python files, my mouse cursor shows a plus sign. Additionally when I run the example.py by "sudo python example.py", I get "name rospy is not defined". My aim is to read the load sensor and make a rostopic to display the numbers. I needed some guidance regarding this !
Thank you for your time!

Why are you using sudo? I don't see any use of it in the README

Hello !
It says permission denied when I do "python example.py"

I'd be very careful about running scripts using sudo

Yes, I thought so. I resolved it and made another package from scratch. Thanks much !

Hello everyone !
It was a silly thing. Those files did not have a
#!/usr/bin/env python

at the top. For further information, I then followed this link and placed the hx711.py (a class which I was trying to import in my node) in another package in my catkin_ws.
