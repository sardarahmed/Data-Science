Q:

Groovy, Turtlebot2, Phantomx Pincher arm
rosrun simple_arm_actions reset_arm_server.py:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/turtlebot/exp1_ws/src/simple_arms/simple_arm_actions/bin/reset_arm_server.py", line 74, in

self.joints = rospy.get_param("/simple_arms/joints")
File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospy/client.py", line 452, in get_param

File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospy/msproxy.py", line 117, in getitem

Can anyone give me some ideas? Thanks!

A:

I don't know anything about the turtlebot or the simple arm server, but it looks like it's trying to retrieve a parameter that isn't set (/simple_arms/joints); probably related to which joints to use.
