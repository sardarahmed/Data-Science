Q:

Path planning to follow another car parallely

Hej guys,
I am currently working on a project where i have to create trajectories(set of waypoints) for a rc car in such a way it follows another car parallely. I have the GPS signals for both cars. The trajectory generated should have a structure(x,y,v). The rc car is in a good state to follow the (x,y,v). The controllers to follow the waypoints is working good. Now i have to have a mathematical idea to relate the (x,y,v) of the rc car and another car(x,y,v) in such a way it runs in parallel .

A:

In my opinion, A is head, B is afterward, set B to follow A's trajectory but with a safety offset from A. is it OK?
or you can refer to turtlebot's (two) follower case.

Hey the problem is offset , A constant offset wont make it run parallel. i would like to know a mathematical formula with heading that can probably change the offset.
