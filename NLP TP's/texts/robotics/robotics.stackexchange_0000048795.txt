Q:

Rosjava + (OpenCV) => (2D to 3D)

Hi,
I want compute 3D position from 2D point of video-stream (from Kinect) in rosjava. I know that, is possible in roscpp/rospy, because existed CV_Bridge and after I can compute 3D position by OpenCV library.
My question, Is something similar possible in rosjava ? or I have to compute manualy ?
Thank for any advice

Could you please tell me which function you use from openCV library to compute 3D position. I am doing the similar work with yours. Thank you.

A:

Did you take a look at OpenCV now supports desktop Java?
