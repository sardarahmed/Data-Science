Q:

Dynamixels (AX-12A) no longer detected after id change

I have 8 dynamixels that are connected together. Everything worked fine until I changed all their ids to 200,201,202, ... To change their ids, I used this python library. Now, none of my motors are detected. I tried testing one motor at a time and I have the same results for all motors.
I tried running factory_reset.py from DynamixelSDK and the script returned:

Succeeded to open the port
Succeeded to change the baudrate Now the controller baudrate is : 1000000
[ID:001] Try factoryreset :
Aborted
[TxRxResult] There is no status packet!

Any idea why I have this error, and how I can fix this? Thank you.

A:

Try a for loop with all possible ids until it is detected.
