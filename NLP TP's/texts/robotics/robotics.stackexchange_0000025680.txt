Q:

TCP Model Control

Hello, I am new to using Gazebo and was hoping to get some help getting started. I am looking to control a model simulated in Gazebo, as well as read sensor information, over TCP with another program (written in c++) running on Ubuntu 12.10. I have seen the example on subscribing to a topic, but I was hoping to find an example on publishing a topic, and how to create the corresponding plugin in Gazebo that would control the model.
