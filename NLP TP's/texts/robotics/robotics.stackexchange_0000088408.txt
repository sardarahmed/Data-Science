Q:

error : couldn't find any package by regex gstreamer0.10-gconf

I am using a ubuntu 14.04 and ros indigo. I just recently installed the pocketsphinx package. When I try to run the sample robocup.launch file, I get an error saying gconfaudiosrc is no element. Hence when i try sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-gconf, I get the following error:
E: Unable to locate package gstreamer0.10-gconf
E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'gstreamer0.10-gconf'
Any sugesstions on what I could do?

A:

Weird, you can try:
sudo apt install  gstreamer0.10-plugins-good

Does that work?

It says that gstreamer0.10-plugins-good is already the newest version. But my problem still persists

Weird, try download the deb file from here and install it by:
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file

followed by
sudo apt-get install -f
