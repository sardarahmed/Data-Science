  <node name="ptam" pkg="ptam" type="ptam" clear_params="true" output="screen">
     <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_mono" /> 
     <remap from="pose" to="pose"/>
     <rosparam file="$(find ptam)/PtamFixParams.yaml"/>
  </node>

but do
 rosrun ptam ptam image:= /camera/image_mono  _rosparam=PtamFixParams.yaml

A:

No, you cannot do this with rosrun
You can load parameters from yaml files with the rosparam load command: http://wiki.ros.org/rosparam#rosparam_load . You may want to use the namespace argument to load your parameters into the private namespace for your node before you start it.
