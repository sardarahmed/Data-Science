Q:

cartographer + move_base

Cartographer and move_base can not run at the same time, move_base subscribes to the /map topic published by cartographer for navigation, without passing through map_server.
I tried to do this, but the time interval between the two frames of the /cmd_val topic published by move_base reached more than 20 seconds.

A:

You do not need map server when you're running SLAM. Map server is just to expose the /map topic of a previous mapping session stored as an image file.
If you have another source of /map, that is unnecessary.

Thanks for your answerÔºÅI still have a question, why does the Control loop take so much time?

You should ask in another question to not mix things. If I answered your question mark as correct so it's off the unanswered questions queue.
