Q:

Monocular camera calibration for Nao

I followed the tutorial for camera_calibration package but after I get

opengl support available

nothing happens.
Here is the result of my rostopic list before running camera calibration:
/nao_camera/camera_info
/nao_camera/image_raw
/rosout
/rosout_agg

And I then run camera_calibration
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.035 image:=/nao_camera/image_raw camera:=/nao_camera --no-service-check

Finally this is the program's output:
init done 
opengl support available 

I checked if images were reaching /nao_camera/image_raw and it was the case.
So what is wrong?

A:

It was a problem coming from OpenCV. After recompiling the newest version the calibration worked well.
