Q:

roscd: No such package/stack 'turtle'

I am following the Navigating the ROS file system tutorial and have followed the prior tutorials in order. Everything has worked correctly until the step
roscd turtle

returns
roscd: No such package/stack 'turtle'

This command was run from /opt/ros/melodic/share/roscpp_tutorials directory. I am in that directory as a result of following the prior commands.
Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04, kernel  4.15.0-45-generic
ROS version: melodic
Tutorial link: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem
env | grep ROS  produces the following:
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/melodic/etc/ros
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_VERSION=1
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=2
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/melodic/share
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=melodic

I was fooled too, would be interesting to add this explanation in the doc

A:

They aren't asking you to run roscd turtle... They are demonstrating how TAB completion works. They want you to type roscd turtle and then hit TAB twice to see all packages that start with the word turtle. They eventually want you to run roscd turtlesim/ which should change directory to the turtlesim package's root directory.
The "No such package/stack" error is because you are trying to change to the root directory of a package called turtle, but there is no package called turtle.

Guess I should have been more patient. I type roscd turtle and press the tab key once, nothing happens. I then hit the enter key and got that message. If I press the tab key twice I do get the list. Your answer helped me to be more patient and pay closer attention. Thank you.

Glad everything worked out! If your question is answered, it would be great if you marked this as the correct answer.
