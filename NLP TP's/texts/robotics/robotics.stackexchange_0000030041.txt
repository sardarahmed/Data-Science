Q:

roslaunch pr2_empty_world.launch not working

Hey guys,
I am attempting to see the OMPL in action, so I was folling part 6 of the MoveArmJointGoal tutorial.
When I attempt to roslaunch pr2_empty_world.launch gazebo briefly opens, then suddenly closes with some red text left in the console.
Here are the last few lines of the console output:
loading model xml from ros parameter
attempting to spawn robot in simulation
waiting for service spawn_urdf_model
directory [/tmp/gazebo-ollie-0] already exists (previous crash?)
the owner gazebo server (pid=30032) is not running.
deleting the old information of the directory [/tmp/gazebo-ollie-0]

Is there anything else I need to do prior to launching?
Here are the logs mentioned above:

gazebo-2*.log
base_hokuyo_node-15.log
tilt_hokuyo_node-16.log
camera_synchronizer_node-17.log

Running c-turtle installed from the debian packages, ubuntu 10.10, 256MB 8600M, 2.4GHz Core2Duo, 3GB ram, etc.
Thanks in advance,
-Oliver

A:

Please see system requirements page to see if your GPU/GPU driver is supported.
If your driver is not on the list, you can check to see if you have direct rendering capability for image sensor simulations and the gazebo gui:
$ glxinfo
name of display: :0.0
display: :0  screen: 0
direct rendering: Yes
server glx vendor string: NVIDIA Corporation
server glx version string: 1.4
server glx extensions: ...
Without proper GPU support, you can try running headless.
If above doesn't apply, please also post a backtrace for further diagnostics.
Thanks.

Thanks for your reply hsu. Direct rendering is enabled, and I have had (a while back) some form of a PR2 simulation running in it before (cant remember which one). How exactly do I do this backtrace, and what exactly of? Thanks!
