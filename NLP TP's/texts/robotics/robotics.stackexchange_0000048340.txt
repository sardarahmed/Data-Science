Q:

Using Kinect to control the motion of the turtlebot based on body movements

Hello,
I'm new to ROS and Gazebo. I am working on a project to get the turtlebot to move around based on the movement of the arms as detected by the kinect. How do i go about this process. How do i assign the turtle bot navigation depending on the movement of the arm.

Hi,
I have been working on exactly what you are asking for a while. Its here. I programmed it for the static gestures made by right hand (simply for different angles made b/w the arm and forearm). I made a map of a house, found a key point for each of the rooms and associated a gesture to a key point. So, when you stand in front of the turtlebot and strike a gesture, it goes to the room which is associated to the gesture. read_user_pose.cpp extracts the gestures, the key points in the map are stored in goalpoints.inputfile and navigation code is key_based_nav.cpp. Sorry, the stack is quite old and has few bugs, you cannot use the code directly. I will be uploading the refined version in GIT shortly. But I am sure that will help you.

Cool! I would love to see this program as an app for turtlebot! What about adding it to turtlebot_apps, once you are done updating the code?

That's an idea! Thanks ;-)
