Q:

ROS2 Resolve topic names rclcpp

In ros1 cpp I was able to resolve a string containing the topic name to the actual topic name that accounts for remappings using the following block:
  // Determine topic name (including remapping)
  std::string mag_topic_name = "/imu/mag";
  mag_topic_name = ros::names::resolve(mag_topic_name);

Is there a similar way I can do this in rclcpp ROS2? I tried digging through the documentations, but could not find something.
Thanks in advance!

A:

I've been looking for this today, and there is a function in Galactic Rolling:
RCLCPP_PUBLIC std::string resolve_topic_name(const std::string & name, bool only_expand = false) const override;

See this pull request. I've copied the code over to my own node.
The only_expand parameter, if true, just adds on the namespace. If false, it also applies remapping, which is probably the option you want.
