Q:

Kobuki - Auto Docking - Action server is not connected yet

Hi All,
A couple of questions - I've just got a Kobuki bot and managed to get most of the Kobuki stack complied on Pi 3 - both talking to one another now - Huzzar! :)
Wanted to try out the auto dock but is complains that it's waiting for the "Action server is not connected yet".
Is this something I need to write specifically or should I be using move_base or something else I've missed?
On a related note - given a use case that the robot is navigating to some location on a map and the battery drops below safe limits then it needs to return to base does this become a case of writing an action client to check for and deal with this situation (i.e. send goal commands http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/SendingSimpleGoals to find - on the map - then dock with the docking station?)
EDIT 1:
This is what the mobile_base_nodelet dies with:
process[diagnostic_aggregator-4]: started with pid [13370] nodelet: /usr/local/include/eigen3/Eigen/src/Core/DenseStorage.h:109: Eigen::internal::plain_array<T, Size, MatrixOrArrayOptions, 16>::plain_array() [with T = double; int Size = 4; int MatrixOrArrayOptions = 0]: Assertion `(internal::UIntPtr(eigen_unaligned_array_assert_workaround_gcc47(array)) & (15)) == 0 && "this assertion is explained here: " "http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-devel/group__TopicUnalignedArrayAssert.html" " **** READ THIS WEB PAGE !!! ****"' failed.
 [mobile_base_nodelet_manager-2] process has died [pid 13368, exit code -6, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/nodelet/nodelet manager __name:=mobile_base_nodelet_manager __log:=/home/pi/.ros/log/1879dcbe-eae1-11e6-9b24-b827ebd5620d/mobile_base_nodelet_manager-2.log]. log file: /home/pi/.ros/log/1879dcbe-eae1-11e6-9b24-b827ebd5620d/mobile_base_nodelet_manager-2*.log

Thanks

A:

I believe you need to first setup the action server with:
roslaunch kobuki_auto_docking minimal.launch

Then you can activate auto docking with:
roslaunch kobuki_auto_docking activate.launch

There is more info on the auto docking tutorial, but it sounds like you just missed step one.

Hi thanks for the reply- I've been trying that. For some reason the mobile_base_nodelet_manager- just dies. No apparent reason that I can see and nothing in the logs.

Does your error match this issue? Also, just in case, would you happen to be doing compact.launch instead of minimal.launch when the kobuki has already been launched? Because compact.launch would be trying to start another nodelet manager.

Looking at that issue it does look the same. I've made the changes mentioned there but as soon as I bring up the last service (roslaunch kobuki_auto_docking activate.launch --screen) then the mobile_base_nodelet_manager just dies. Either with the error in EDIT 1 or the one mentioned in that issu
