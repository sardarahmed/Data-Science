Q:

Do you have any advice for sending PointCloud2 over a wireless nework

I am trying to send the PointCloud2 topic through a wireless network. Is there already some implementation in ros I am missing? Any good link you would recommend?

A:

Just start your publisher on one machine and the subscriber on another, as described in this tutorial. This is not specific to wireless networks.
In case you have to limit the bandwidth, have a look at the topic_tools stack, especially the throttle node.
