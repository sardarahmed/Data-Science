Q:

Need help with message declaration

Hello
I wish to use a message type that i created in one of my packages in my other package, but for some reason it doesn't work :
The package were the message is declared named dany_controller_pkg and the message type is velocity_derection.
In order to use this message type in my other new package, i add to the new package Manifest file, the following dependency :
<depend package="dany_controller_pkg"/>

and included in the cpp file of my new package the following declaration :
#include <dany_controller_pkg/velocity_derection.h>

Still for some reason when i compile, the compiler doesn't recognize the imported message type.
The exact compiler error is:
Unresolved inclusion: <dany_controller_pkg/velocity_derection.h>

(Also, in the original package this message type works fine)
What am i missing ?
Thanks.

I added the exact compiler error, you can see it above.

A:

Turned out that the problem is with the eclipse !
For some reason when i compile using Eclipse it marks all the places where i using velocity_derection topic as errors, and writes that they are Unresolved. But still the compilation succeeds and the program works fine. I have no idea why it behave in this way.
Nevertheless, I want to thank you KruseT and TommyP for your great help !
Also, if someone have any suggestions why it happens, I be happy to know.
