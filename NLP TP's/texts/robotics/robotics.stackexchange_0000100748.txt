Q:

What are the information represented by echo the topic of camera_info and image_raw?

Hi, I am using a multi camera plugin with SDF and the left and right images are published well in Rviz2. I wish to know the depth/distance of the object from the camera based on the images produced hence I try to echo the topic of camera_info and image_raw.
For camera_info, I get:
d :

0.0
0.0
0.0
0.0

k:

476.703...
0.0

r:

0.0
0.0
1.0

p:

same as k

while for image_raw topic, i get number range from 153 to 158.
May i know what are all these information means? And how can I use these information for my purpose to identify the distance of object?
Thank you in advanced.

Hi, there are three main topics advertised in most RGBD cameras:

camera_info displays information related to the camera itself, like the size of the image and those parameters that "calibrate" it
image_raw is the image itself, like the name suggests. Each number corresponds to pixel intensity
depth/points is the one you are interested, as it displays the distance for each reading. You can also view this topic in rviz

If you want, I made explaining the topics from a depth camera:
