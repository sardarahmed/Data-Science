Q:

mountain lion install broken?

I've been following the instructions on (http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source) to install ros/fuerte on a macbook...(OSX 10.8). I get to the line:
brew install ros/fuerte/swig-wx
which generates the following error:

bash-3.2$ brew install ros/fuerte/swig-wx
==> Cloning git://github.com/wg-debs/swig-wx.git
Cloning into '/Library/Caches/Homebrew/swig-wx--git'...
fatal: remote error:
Repository not found.
Error: Failure while executing: git clone --no-checkout --depth 1 --branch upstream/1.3.29 git://github.com/wg-debs/swig-wx.git /Library/Caches/Homebrew/swig-wx--git

In the troubleshooting part of the page, it says that the git repository has been removed, and provides some code.

require 'formula'
class SwigWx < Formula
url 'git://github.com/ros/swig-wx.git', {:using => :git, :tag => '1.3.29_fuerte'}
homepage 'http://www.swig.org'
version '1.3.29'
def install
ENV.universal_binary
system "./configure --prefix=#{prefix}"
system "make"
system "make install"
end
end

Can anybody tell me what am I supposed do with this code? Or maybe this is a red herring?
Thank You!!!

A:

Ok ... still don't know the answer about what to do with the "Troubleshooting Tip", but the workaround is to run the commands in the file separately:

git clone --branch 1.3.29_fuerte git://github.com/ros/swig-wx.git /Library/Caches/Homebrew/swig-wx--git

cd /Library/Caches/Homebrew/swig-wx--git/

./configure

make

make install

But I'd still love to know what that file is supposed to be.
