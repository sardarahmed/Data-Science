Q:

Arduino IDE does not find msg header

I'm trying to learn rosserial_arduino. I've worked through the tutorials and am now going back and walking through them with my own code. My initial test code will use rosserial_arduino to turn 8 LEDs on and off. I've created the package (arduino) and a custom message called 8Leds.msg. I added the lines per the tutorials to package.xml and CMakeLists.txt. I source my files and run catkin_make. Everything seems to compile properly and the 8Leds.h file is created in devel/include/arduino. However, when I try to compile the sketch for the arduino I get this error:
In file included from light_8_leds_test.ino:2:0:
/home/jcicolani/catkin_ws/devel/include/arduino/8Leds.h:42:18: fatal error: string: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
I don't get it. It's even showing the exact path and file name.
Thoughts?

A:

You need to run the following again everytime you changed/added msg files in your workspace:
  cd <sketchbook>/libraries
  rm -rf ros_lib
  rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .

See: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup#Install_ros_lib_into_the_Arduino_Environment
Note that your arduino code needs to be compiled against the headers in your /libraries folder, not against those in your catkin workspace....
