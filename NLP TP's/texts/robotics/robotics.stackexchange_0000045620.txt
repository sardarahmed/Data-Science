Q:

Stage control for "go to x,y"

Hello All,
I was wondering if there is a package that I could use to send a simulated stage robot from point A to point B. I see that one can publish to cmd_vel for a particular robot. However I want to avoid doing the path planning myself. My first idea was to use move_base, however I intend to use several simulated robots, so I am not sure if I can launch several move_base instances. Plus it would be overkill. I hear Stage_Controller has some capabilities, though I couldnt find any documentation regarding "go to goal" capabilities.
Thank you,
Ammar

A:

I suggest to use move_base. It should definitely be possible to run multiple instances in parallel.
