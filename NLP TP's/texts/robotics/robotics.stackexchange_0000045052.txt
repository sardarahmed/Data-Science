I managed to run successfully on Ros Fuerte, Ubuntu 12.04. You need to be more specific on your problem however, if you are seeking any help.

@yygyt  Hello, I want to know you complete the entire RGBDSLAM the complete process.I need to pay attention to what? Reference website is http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam?

Yes, of course. I can't say anything about paying attention. I mean install and build the package. If you have any problems please state it explicitly. State your system configuration too. Ubuntu, fuerte etc.. Otherwise I won't be able to help.

@yygyt  i am confused . in the page http://answers.ros.org/question/38989/rgbdslam-with-ros-fuerte-installed/    he said when he type rosdep install rgbdslam . but in the wiki http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam, there is no such command. just have rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg. is the wiki changed?

rgbdslam_freiburg is the stack, rgbdslam is the package. it shouldn't matter much

Have you seen the command sequence at the bottom of rgbdslam's wiki page? I tried this sequence on a ubunut 11.10 and it worked fine. I'm also running it on ubuntu 12.04. It seems that you downloaded rgbdslam_freiburg into a folder that is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

A:

I've added a description for how to install ROS Fuerte and RGBDSLAM on Ubuntu from scratch to the wiki page. This was a test of the installation and worked for me without problems. I think it was a 64bit Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10, so it should work for you. If you are using a 32bit Ubuntu, I cannot guarantee anything, because I have none to test it on.
Good luck
