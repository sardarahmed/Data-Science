Q:

Gedit roscpp debugger?

Hello, I'm writing some nodes in roscpp using gedit.  I'm encountering some errors, and am getting tired of tracing them using print statements.  I would like to use a debugger to fix my code, but am not sure exactly how to go about this in gedit (and also in ROS, if that makes a difference).  I've read a little about GDB, but am not sure how to integrate it into gedit, and again, I'm not sure if the fact that I'm writing ROS nodes rather than regular C++ stuff makes things more complicated.
Anyone have any ideas?

A:

gedit is just a text editor and I doubt that there is a debugger plugin for that. Try using a propper IDE like qtcreator (sudo apt-get install qtcreator) which naturally understand CMakeLists.txt files so there is no set-up needed. Just run it from the terminal with qtcreator my_catkin_ws/src/CMakeLists.txt.
See this answer on how to use the debugger.
