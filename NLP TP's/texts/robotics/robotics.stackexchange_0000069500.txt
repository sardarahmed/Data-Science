Q:

Ikfast computation time

The average time calculation in http://kaist-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/arm_kinematics_tools/src/ikfastdemo/ikfastdemo.cpp
Says milliseconds but it seems to me it should be microseconds.
Shouldn't it be microseconds? Can anyone clarify this for me?

As this is purely an OpenRave/IKFast question, I think you'd better ask this on openrave-users (which I believe you already found).
As to your code: it is really old (2012), so it might be that in newer versions it has changed.

Hi gvdhoorn, I posted the question here because this code was given in ROS wiki
http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Tutorials/Create_a_Fast_IK_Solution#Testing_output_from_IKFast
Do you know where I can find the latest version?

That still doesn't make it a ROS problem. All that code was generated by OpenRave scripts, not ROS.

Do you know where I can find the latest version?

In more recent OpenRave distributions, I'd guess.

Ok........

A:

Note OpenRAVE still is maintained and actively developed, but moved to github some time ago (https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave). What is true is that there hasn't been a official release for some time, however.
How much time ikfast computation takes is highly dependent on the kinematics of your manipulator. There are cases where computation takes few microseconds (typically 6DOF arm, nicely intersecting axes) and cases where it takes a few milliseconds (dealing with complicated kinematics, more or less than exactly 6DOF). In the "hard" cases, the success rate often is lower, too (or the ikfast generator fails to generate a solution at all). These are rules of thumb however, you really have to test this for the kinematics you're looking at to be sure.
