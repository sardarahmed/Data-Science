Q:

How to use for loop in launch file in gazebo?

How can implement for loop concept in gazebo to spawn multiple robot model?
For example:
<include file="$(find manycar)/launch/azcar.launch">
<arg name="robot_num" value="1"/>
<arg name="init_pose" value="-x 1 -y 1 -z 0 -Y 1.57 "/>
</include>

I want to iterate above code n times, variable being robot_num's value.
How should I do that?

A:

Maybe you could use embedded ruby the same way it can be used for SDF.
See this SDF example where wheels are generated in a for loop for a cart.

Years passed, the link https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/src/e024fe922c810f468e2a7ab277750354465478cd/cart_front_steer/model.rsdf?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#model.rsdf-79 looks broken to me.
