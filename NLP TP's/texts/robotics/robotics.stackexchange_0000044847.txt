Q:

ROS Core build on arch Linux

Hi all,
I get the following error when i build the ROS core on a arch linux x86_64 system. I do not know much but a bit of googling pointed me to believe that this could be a boost lib problem that should have been solved in version 1.50 of boost which i have installed but no luck. If someone could help me solve this would be helpful.
Thanks
The Error is below:

I encountered the same problem when installing ROS from the sources with rosinstall.

A:

That is interesting. So the corresponding line in the cpp file is:
#if BOOST_VERSION >= 105000

I wonder what BOOST_VERSION expands to. I would actually just manually patch the c++ file locally. Just get rid of the #if, #else and #endif lines and keep the code in the if block in case your boost version is greater or equal than 1.50.
That's sort of an ugly hack but I guess the quickest way to get ROS compiled.

Hi Lorenz, Could not find the # if BOOST_VERSION anywhere in the source :( i tried grep -rl '#if BOOST' .

I did not understand the answer either before looking at https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/10
