Q:

Trouble with tutorial

I am new to linux, but I'm trying my best to deal with the terminal command line. I've finally got the right version of linux and ros diamondback installed in a virtual machine and I'm trying to work my way through the tutorials so I can eventually be able to port a control system onto a quadrotor. I've gotten to the "Create a Package" tutorial and I can't get roscd working. It returns "roscd: command not found". I did some digging and apparently the installations have changed some policy having to do with the difference between setup.sh and setup.bash:
 As of rosinstall version 0.5.12 it will no longer use bashisms in the 
setup.sh file.  They have been moved to setup.bash.  And for zsh users 
there is also a setup.zsh generated. 
For existing bash users this will mean that until you switch to use
setup.bash instead of setup.sh you will not have the command line tools
you are used to such as rosrun roscd and tab completion.

The tutorial only instructs me on how to create a setup.sh file. There is no setup.bash file in my tutorial directory so I can't just write setup.bash vs setup.sh in my bashrc file. Can anybody help me?

Is there a specific reason why you're using diamondback instead of the latest version (electric)?

A:

Hello! Strange, but I have setup.bash (ubuntu 11.04, Electric).
But I can say, that you don't really need in roscd/rosls etc. You can use standard linux commands, like cd or ls, with the same result (you only should to use full path to directory, e.g. 'roscd yourProject' vs 'cd ~/ros/yourProject'). It's not so comfortable, but it works!
If you really need in setup.bash - here it is.
