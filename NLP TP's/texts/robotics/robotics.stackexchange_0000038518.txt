Q:

Possible to filter messages in rxplot?

I'm stuck using a message type that was perhaps poorly designed in that it's been multiplexed. That is to say several different joints are using the same message, but filling out a different joint index. I can't change the message unfortunately, but still need to work with it.
Is it possible to use rxplot to plot the information in such messages? I would have to basically set up some sort of conditional plotting.
I'm guessing this is not possible and my best option is to write a little translator node to convert the messages into either different topics or one that aggregates. But figured I'd ask anyway.

A:

You could also pipe data with a filter using rostopic like so (one line):
rostopic echo --filter "int(m.header.stamp.secs) % 3 == 0" /imu_data/orientation/x | rostopic pub bar std_msgs/Float64

This example just publishes messages with a timestamp divisible by 3 to bar, but you can put any python expression there (such as to filter by your joint index) and then use:
rxplot bar/data

to plot it. However the rostopic wiki article warns that filtering give a performance hit, not sure how that would impact your current system.
