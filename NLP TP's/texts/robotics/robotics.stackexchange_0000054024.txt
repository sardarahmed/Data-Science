Q:

uvc_camera not launching in ros groovy

I get this error when
roslaunch uvc_camera camera_node.launch is run in a terminal.
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [uvc_camera/uvc_camera]: can't locate node [uvc_camera] in package [uvc_camera]
ROS groovy.

A:

There is no uvc_camera package included in groovy, I don't know why. It appears again in hydro.
However there's a package in the repository called ros-groovy-usb-cam.
Install, then run "rosrun usb-cam usb_cam_node"
Alternatively you can also use ros-groovy-gscam (http://wiki.ros.org/gscam).
