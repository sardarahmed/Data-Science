Q:

[ROS2 YAML] Config file without node name

Is it possible to write a YAML parameter file without specifying the ROS2 node name?
The current format for a YAML file is the following:
namespace:
    node_name:
        ros__parameters:
            general:
                param_1: 0
                param_2: 'a'
                param_3: 3.14

The problem comes when I have a launch file that can dynamically change the namespace and the node_name (multi robot for example). How can the config YAML file be adapted to the dynamic change?
Thank you
Walter

Well, I found a solution to that.
TL;DR put double asterisk instead of the node name in YAML file.
Elaborate demonstration is on GitHub: https://github.com/yossioo/ros2-yaml-unnamed-node
Feel free to comment is something is unclear.

Thanks for posting that example! This functionality should be available for ROS 2 releases of Dashing and later. (August 2019 and later)

I'm using this solution without any issue launching "normal" nodes with manual composition.
It is not working instead if I compose the nodes in a container in a launch file.
Is this possible?

Please, share an example that I could run and I will try to check that for you.

I found an issue on Github that confirms my problem: https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/715
There are two workarounds but both do not fit my configuration. I'm using Eloquent.
