Q:

Where do I get the package sr_control_gui?

I am trying to install the sr_control_gui package into my ros-fuerte on ubuntu 12.04.
I installed the sr_visualization stack because sr_control_gui is part of the  stack (see sr_control_gui)
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-sr-visualization

but it is not in there. roscd sr-visualization works, roscd sr_control_gui doesn't.
Where can I get this package?

hmm.. but that does not help me. I need sr_control_gui to launch cyberglove (from the sr-teleop stack).
Running roslaunch cyberglove cyberglove.launch throws a ResourceNotFound: sr_control_gui error

A:

Okay, I talked to the guy maintaining these packages.
It turns out they removed the package sr_control_gui from the stack and the dependency is a bug that is going to be fixed.
If someone is having the same problem right now, let me know and I'm going to share the hotfix.
