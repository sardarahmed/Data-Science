Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Edit a rosbag

I am interested in interactively editing a bag. Specifically, I have some bags which consist mainly of image data, and I want to delete some frames for various uninteresting reasons.
I don't fathom it would be crazy difficult to roll my own program which opens a bag, reads and displays each frame using OpenCV and ask the user to write that frame to a new bag (non-image data is always kept). Has anybody done anything like this before?
Alternatively, could I use the rxbag plugin API to delete messages directly from within rxbag (eg, selecting them in the timeline and deleting)?
I have very little experience with bags besides record/play and a quick glance at the API seems to suggest that editing isn't on the menu. If anybody has done any editing of rosbags, I would certainly appreciate any help you could give me.

A:

Check out the rosbag API and the rosbag cookbook. The cookbook has some samples of ways to modify a bag file.
