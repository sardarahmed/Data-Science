Q:

Rosdep: Adding dependencies that have to be compiled

Hello,
I have to integrate some external dependencies into my ROS packet, that are not available as debs but only source code on github. I thought that you have to declare in your manifest.xml , then create a rosdep.yaml file and put something like
someNameWhichIsNotOnThebase.yamlList: 
  ubuntu: 
mkdir -p ~/ros/ros-deps
    cd ~/ros/ros-deps
    wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/project/foo/tarball/master
    tar xpvf master
    cd master
    mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install

(And I am not sure maybe search in CMakeLists.txt for this lib?)
But since it doesn't work, I would like to know how you are supposed to do this.
I would be very grateful for your help.
Regards,
Oier

What is your ROS distro? Are you using catkin? This is quite important for that question.

I am using fuerte.

A:

rosdep changed to rosdep2 in fuerte, so there is no more rosdep.yaml.
You have two possibilities here:

Use catkin for building the code. As the external code seems to be cmake, wrapping that should be really easy. However, I have no idea about the status of catkin in fuerte.
Wrap the code into a ROS package.

The second is probably closer to what you wanted to do originally.
