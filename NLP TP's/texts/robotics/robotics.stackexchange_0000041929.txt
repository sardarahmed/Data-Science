Q:

unresolved external symbol "bool ros::console::g_initialized"

Hi all,
I'm creating a small package in Windows using the Msvc Build Environment - Fuerte. I have run the sdk demo and it executes very well. But when I have wrote my own application and I try to compile it, the linker throws me the error:
unresolved external symbol "bool ros::console::g_initialized"
I have checked the include folder and the lib folder and the rosconsole.lib but I can't produce the executable. I have looking for the g_initiaized variable but I only found the extern definition. I can't found the real declaration.
Any help will be useful,
Alxperez

A:

I answer my own question. You need to include the ROS_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS definition in order to uses the dlls instead of the static libraries.
I have generated the msvc project using a catkinized cmake inside the console2. This project doesn't have some configurations like folder include (rosdeps), or some  additional preprocessor definitions like BOOST_LIB_TOOLSET="vc" in order to correctly find the boost libraries and the ROS_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS definition that uses the dlls.
Once this definitions is added, and the rosdep folder is included, the program compiles and links very well.
