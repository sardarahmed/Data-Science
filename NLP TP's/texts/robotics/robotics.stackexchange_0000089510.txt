Q:

How can I publish a global path exactly once?

I am using move_base package from navigation stack in ROS. For the parameters, I have selected o use grid_path due to my robot's motion limitations. Everything works as expected but now, whenever I send a goal (2d nav goal on rviz), move_base constructs a full path from the beginning till the goal point and the topic is called /move_base/GlobalPlanner/plan . The problem is that the topic continuously spams with the same path message until robot gets to the destination. How can I make to publish a single message to the topic and not spam?

try using a service

A:

Well you could use a service, that way it behaves in a request/response kind of way.
Check this service nav_msgs/GetPlan from here http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/srv/GetPlan.html
You'll send:
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped start

geometry_msgs/PoseStamped goal

float32 tolerance

and you'll get a:
nav_msgs/Path plan

If you need to learn more about services the wiki is your friend http://wiki.ros.org/Services
Good luck!
