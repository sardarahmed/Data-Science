Q:

Gazebo recording stream from camera

Hi,
I'm simulating a quadrotor with Gazebo and I'd like to know if there's a way to save the image stream acquired from the camera mounted on the vehicle into an .avi file, in other words I'd like to take a video of what the camera sees, is it possible?
thanks!

A:

You can record images using rosbag record and then combine them into a video:
