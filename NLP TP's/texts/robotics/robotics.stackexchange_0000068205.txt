Q:

converting one topic to another (front_cam/camera/image to sensor_msgs/image)

Hello,
I am thinking of incorporating visual odometry onto hector-quadrotor which currently uses LIDAR. There is a front cam functionality ( topics like:
/front_cam/camera/image
/front_cam/camera/image/compressed
/front_cam/camera/image/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/front_cam/camera/image/compressed/parameter_updates
/front_cam/camera/image/compressedDepth
/front_cam/camera/image/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions
/front_cam/camera/image/compressedDepth/parameter_updates
/front_cam/camera/image/theora
/front_cam/camera/image/theora/parameter_descriptions
/front_cam/camera/image/theora/parameter_updates

while the visual odometry (viso2_ros subscribes to sensor_msgs/image).
Is it possible to covert from front_cam/camera/image to sensor_msgs/image .
Tried to look up for /front_cam but couldn't find any documentation relating to that
Thanks

A:

According to the viso2_ros wiki page, the input topic name for the monocular node is image.
You can change the input topic name using remapping.
Try something like
rosrun viso2_ros mono_odometer image:=/front_cam/camera/image
