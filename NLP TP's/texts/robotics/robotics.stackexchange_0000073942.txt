Have you tried building with catkin_make instead of make? It looks like the build system for that package was converted to cmake, but the instructions weren't updated.

I placed that in the orocos folder. I build it with catkin_make_isolated --install. Now it is running nicely. How to run soem to scan slave devices?. The instruction in Internet is not working. How can i get tutorial for this.

A:

If you can get through this link it will get into any error.
https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM
and finally you will need ros integrated soem. Here is the link for that :
