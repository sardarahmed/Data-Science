Q:

Sift-Tree-File for the Vocabulary-tree

Hello
I'd like to know if someone has generated a tree-file for the vocab_tree-stack for other descriptors than only calonder. I would like to use it for loop-closing in the RGBD-Slam.
The stack only provides one for calonder-desctiptors, but I'm not really happy with their perfomance, so I'm looking for a way to compare the perfomance of the tree with different descriptors.

A:

Nikolas,
in the
https://tum-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tum-ros-pkg/perception/objects_of_daily_use_finder/src/odu_finder.cpp
file we have done so for the SIFT feature. Look into the following function:
void ODUFinder::build_database(std::string directory).
