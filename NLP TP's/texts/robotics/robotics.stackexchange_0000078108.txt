Q:

Installing Packages

Hi,
I was trying to learn ros3djs web interfacing. In the tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/ros3djs/Tutorials/VisualizingInteractiveMarkers), it was written to install the following packages: interactive_marker_tutorials, interactive_marker_proxy, rosbridge_server, tf2_web_republisher.
How do i install them ?
(I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo)
Thanks and regards !

A:

For most released ros packages you can install them via apt-get.
The signature is in general:
sudo apt-get install ros-<your distro>-<meta package name with underscores (_) replaced by dashes (-) >

So for instance for your first package interactive_marker_tutorials the package wiki tells you that it is hosted inside the metapackage visualization_tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/visualization_tutorials) . visualization_tutorials  is released so we can install it via apt-get. For your distro indigo the command would then be:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-visualization-tutorials

Note that you can install individual packages also using apt-get. No need to install the entire metapackage.
