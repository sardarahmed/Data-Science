Q:

receiving signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault when running a node

Hello everyone,
I getting "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" error when running a node, despite the fact that it worked well before
when I run it with gdb I'm getting this
Starting program: /home/jafar/catkin_ws/devel/lib/kuka_arm/trajectory_sampler 
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".

Thread 1 "trajectory_samp" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff55d8f18 in ros::WallTime::now() ()
from /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/librostime.so

Anyone know why this's happening ..?
Thanks

A:

There have been a nr of reports of ABI breakages with Kinetic after the last sync.
Have you rebuilt your workspace recently and/or upgraded all packages?
