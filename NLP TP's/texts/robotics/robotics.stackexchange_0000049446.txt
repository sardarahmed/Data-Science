I have the same problem. How did you solve it?

A:

Ok. I just found the solution, you also need to install the turtlebot package the turtlebot_simulator alone isn't enough.
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-turtlebot

Turtlebot simulation in Groovy is not yet supported. ItÂ´s targeted for Hydro. If we get it working earlier, we will let you. Join the TurtleBot SIG mailing list to stay up to date!
