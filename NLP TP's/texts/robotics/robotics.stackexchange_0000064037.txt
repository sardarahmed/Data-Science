Q:

people detection / tracking (wg_perception) on indigo: easy_markers dependency

It seems that Indigo's Perception package (people detection and tracking) requires dependency: easy_markers.
(two other dependencies, ros-indigo-bfl and ros-indigo-costmap-2d exists and are good).
catkin_make's  call stack: people-indigo-devel/people_velocity_tracker/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)
There is not package "ros-indigo-easy-markers" for Indigo.
Out of desperation, I used "easy_markers" from wo_ros_tools_hydro, and Perception package compiles but does NOT run (does not display people, positions, produces error messages during run).
Could you please upload the "easy_markers" on GitHub?
This is the only dependency that is missing so far.
So far, David Lu has been very helpful and posted entire People Perception. We are missing 0.0001% of the stuff.

Wow, Doctor Lu! You are God! PS: it is our Portland State University robot, MCECE bot, aka Jeeves, that runs on Ubuntu and Indigo already. And our Professor says we must have Kinect working before the end of the term! Whatever is left from the "term".

'Tis strange, 'Tis strange: I installed open_ptrack (it is their People Tracking package) and it compiled and runs beautifully on Indigo. But their site does not specify that open_ptrack must use specific versions of ROS. Somehow, it compiles on any.

Another dependency missing: kalman_filter. I used it from hydro distribution during people package installation.

'Tis strange, 'Tis strange: I installed open_ptrack (it is their version of ROS's People Tracking package) and it compiled and runs beautifully on Indigo. But their package is in directory "hydro", yet runs beautifully. Makes me wonder how their packages have forward compatibility.
