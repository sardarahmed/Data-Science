A:

$sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-camera
$sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-launch
It still works, but I am wondering that openni_launch has already been included in rgbd_launch in hydro?

是的。 rgbd_launch contains all the common launch files required by a driver specific launch package such as openni_launch or freenect_launch. http://wiki.ros.org/rgbd_launch
