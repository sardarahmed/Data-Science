Q:

How to use ros2_control with actual hardware communicating via etherCAT?

I am learning ros2_control with the real hardware. I need some help writing hardware interface for the current setup. I do not have experience writing on the communication side of the real hardware.
setup:
I have Jetson nano, drives, motors, and sensors communicating via EtherCAT and using ros2 foxy and SOEM_ROS2 package. these were installed and running without ros2 control, simply via publisher and subscriber. The whole system controls the x,y,z axis with prismatic joint. It is not a robot. so no end effector.
Now, I want to integrate ros2 control with the whole system. I don't know how to get the values from the hardware for the read and write methods of the hardware interface.
I appreciate any help you can provide.

Have you seen this EtherCAT driver?
