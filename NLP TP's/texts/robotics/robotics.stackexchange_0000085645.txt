Q:

Delete node binaries

Hi,
I wonder if it is possible to delete the binary files of a particular node from a workspace because I want to replace its source file with another one of the same name and generate a new binary file from the new source file. If I just replace the source file, it won't generate a new binary file when I do catkin_make. Right now, I'm deleting the devel and build folders to delete all the binary files.
Best,

A:

Replacing the source should work, as make should detect that it has changed and then proceed to build the new binary. If that doesn't work then that would be considered a bug.
As to the binaries themselves: they are located in $CATKIN_WS/devel/lib.
