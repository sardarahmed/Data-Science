Q:

problem in launching a camera

Hi, everybody!
I have installed the openni_kinect(the camera I use is kinect), then I entered "rosmake openni_kinect --rosdep-install" and "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch" in the terminal, the first command got executed successfully, but the second one failed.
Here is some information in the terminal.
[rospack] warning: error parsing manifest file at [/home/llq/ros_workspace/pkgs/foobar/manifest.xml]?
Calibration hasn't been done to the camera, is this the cause? If so, is their any tutorial I can follow to complete the calibration?

A:

This has nothing to do with kinect. You have problem with the syntax in the manifest file of one of your personal packages (in /home/llq/ros_workspace/pkgs/foobar/). Resolve that first. Quick fix would be to move it out of your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, so ros doesn't find it.
