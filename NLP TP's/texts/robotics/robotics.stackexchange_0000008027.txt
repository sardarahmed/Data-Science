Q:

How to sumarize Kalman filter covariances for display?

I'm implementing an extended Kalman filter and I'm facing a problem with showing the covariances to the user.
The covariance matrix estimate contains all the information we have about the current value estimate, but that is too much to display.
I would like to have a single number that says "our estimate is really good" when close to 0 and "our estimate is not worth much" when large.
My intuitive simple solution would be to average all the values in the covariance estimate matrix (or maybe just the diagonal), except that in my case the values have different units and different ranges.
Is it possible to do something like this?

A:

It's tough to say anything about a really large covariance matrix. This is because (presumably) the matrix includes the uncertainty about a whole bunch of features, not just the robot pose. Typically what matters in real life is the uncertainty in the position of the robot (and possibly orientation). So with only three spatial deimensions, you can easily display a 3D covariance ellipse which will tell you the expected position and uncertainty of the robot.
In literature there are several methods for displaying some statistics about an arbitrarily large state space. The most common is some measure of the eigenvalues of the matrix. (For a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix, this is often a covariance ellipse as mentioned above) For an nxn matrix, you can display the blockwise covariances for each feature, which will tell you which features are very, very roughly estimated, or you can output some function of the covariance itself.
For example, the determinant is a common measure of uncertainty used in GPS as the Dillution of Precision. Another common measure is the maximum eigenvalue, though that only really makes sense on a feature-by-feature basis.
