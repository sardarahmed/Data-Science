Q:

ImportError No module name drone_status

Hello,
I am just starting out with learning ROS. I tried simulating the Ardrone, using the tum simulator on ROS Indigo and Gazebo2. Ref: https://github.com/dougvk/tum_simulator
I am trying to implement this code - https://github.com/amroygaol/AR_Drone_Example_code/blob/master/forward.py.
I followed through the instructions, however, I keep getting an error,
ImportError:No module named drone_status.

I can control the drone by directly publishing on the terminal, although, I cannot do it using the python script.
Can you please help me out?

A:

It looks like it's not being used. Try commenting out the offending line
from drone_status import DroneStatus
