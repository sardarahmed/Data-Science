What exactly does a  motor driver do? Why do we need an additional power supply for motors? I'm a hobbyist and making a line follower from scratch.

A:

At a high level, a motor driver takes a "logic-level" input (desired "effort") and delivers a corresponding "high-side" output to the motor. Exactly what is inside the motor driver depends on the motor and driver (for example brushed and brushless motors are driven very differently).  Larger motors like the ones in quadcopters or higher end remote control cars tend to be brushless motors, which are driven using carefully offset sinusoidal inputs (very roughly speaking).  A smaller line-follower robot will typically use a brushed motor, which can be controlled using simpler circuits such as an H-bridge. 
There are several reasons to "isolate" the motor and control power supplies.

Motors have a lot of electrical "inertia" (inductance) which translates into a lot of electrical noise pushed back into the power supply. Microcontrollers are built assuming that the input supply is reasonably "clean", and this noise can reset your control circuitry (best case), or burn out internal components (worst-case). 
Motors often have higher voltage and current requirements than control circuitry. For example the digital outputs of an aruino can put out around 100mA at 5 volts (which might be enough for a small line follower). A brushless motor used on a small fixed wing aircraft such as the Zephyr II can draw 100 amps at 12 volts.

Note that you do not need a separate battery for the controls and motor power, but you should have separate circuitry which "cleans" the raw battery voltage (such as an LDO or buck converter) before sending it to the control circuitry.
