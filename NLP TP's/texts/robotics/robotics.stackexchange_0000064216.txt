Q:

rosserial_arduino avoid lost messages

Hi, i'm using rosserial_arduino package to communicate with my robot hardware.
I'm noticing that some messages are lost in both ways (Arduino->Desktop & Desktop->Arduino)
I'm not publishing at high speed, to be more precise messages are sent with several seconds interval between them.
Is there a way to make message delivery guaranteed?
I can wrap messages in services and use the service responses as aknowledges for but it sounds pretty ugly.

A:

After some "in depth" debugging I discovered that in my case the problem was caused by a buffer overflow on arduino serial rx buffer.
In this case higher baud rates increase the problem :)
Is easy to modify the buffer size on arduino source though.
