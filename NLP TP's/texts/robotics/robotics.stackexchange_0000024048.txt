Q:

Ros2 and communication - How do you post a Ros2 message in a text box in Unity?

I am developing a project with ros_msft_mrtk and would like to send simple messages via Ros2 to Unity or then to the Hololens2. Unfortunately, I don't understand Ros2's communication. I use the SubscriptionExample, added it to a GameObject and now want to display sented messages in a text field in Unity. That was my attempt:
I get the error: Cannot implicitly convert type 'std_msgs.msg.String' to 'string'. How can I store a received std_msgs.msg.String in a string to output it in Unity and later on the HoloLens?

A:

From the tutorial that you linked. The string value that you want is in the data field of the message msg.Data not the message named std_msgs/String
You can see the message definition here.
