Q:

Humanoid balancing

I'm currently working on Humanoid robot. I've solved the Forward & Inverse Kinematic relations of the robot, and they turn out to be fine. Now I want to move onto Walking. I've seen tons of algorithms & research papers but none of them make the idea clear. I understand the concept of ZMP & what the method tries to do, but I simply can't get my head around all the details that are required to implement it in a real robot. Do I have to plan my gait & generate the trajectories beforehand, solve the joint angles, store them somewhere & feed it to the motors in real-time? or Do I generate everything at run-time(a bad Idea IMO)? Is there a step-by-step procedure that I can follow to get the job done? or Do I have to crawl all my way through those Research papers, which never make sense(at least for me).

A:

Keep in mind that the ZMP is a simplification. In practice with walking robots the support polygon is constantly changing so it can be tough to keep the ZMP inside. 
Pregenerated (offline) trajectories will only work in very specific conditions (flat ground, no disturbances), and only if you can model your support polygon well. 
That said, everything you learn as you try to make your robot walk with offline trajectories will be useful going forward.
