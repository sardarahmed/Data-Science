Q:

1.4 update resetting the ~/.gazebo/models folder

It's possible I've just forgotten where I put the model I was working with a couple weeks ago, but I think it was in the ~/.gazebo/models/ folder.

Would 1.4 have reset the contents of this folder?

If so, is there a way of recovering it?

A:

It's slightly dangerous to put models that you're working on in the ~/.gazebo/models folder. The danger only comes into play if you happen to give the model that same name as a model currently in the model database, and you download that model from the database. Otherwise, you should be safe.
If the model is not in your .gazebo/models folder, then it's probably someplace else on your computer.
