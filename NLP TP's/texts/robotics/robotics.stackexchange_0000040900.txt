Q:

rosjava publisher and subscriber in the same node

If I take a single node (a class that extends AbstractNodeMain) and I include both publishers and a subscriber, the subscriber does not seem to receive any information that I publish to its topic with rostopic.
I was trying to merge both the Listener and Talker examples into a single entity that publishes using the executeCancellableLoop and subscribes to a topic with the addMessageListener method. My goal is to write a robot driver that publishes sensor data at the same time that it listens for movement commands. Can this be done?
If I avoid adding the subscriber the publisher works fine, and viceversa. If I add both things, the publisher works fine but the subscriber doesn't read any data, although the topic appears in the output of rostopic list.
I am using ROS Fuerte with the Python roscore.

Could you share some code?

A:

I moved my development from an x86 machine to a 64-bit one, running Ubuntu Precise and ROS Fuerte. My logging messages inside the subscriber started showing up on the rxconsole, so this is solved.
