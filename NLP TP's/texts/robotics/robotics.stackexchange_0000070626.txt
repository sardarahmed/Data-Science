Q:

Where can I find MasterApiEntity.msg and MasterApi.msg from ARNI Package?

I would like to evaluate the ARNI, but after cloning the project on my pc I am not able to build/start the gui or arni_processing as those two messages are missing in the repo.

A:

Hi, sorry to answer you such late, I haven't seen your question before. You can find those under arni_msgs but I think your problem is another. After downloading the package into your workspace you have to recompile it with catkin_make to generate the msg files. Then it will probably work. You can find more information on catkin here: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials
I hope this helps.
