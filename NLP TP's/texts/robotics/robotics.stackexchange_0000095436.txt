Q:

Talker/Listener over SSH

Hello!
I was wondering if it's possible to run the talker/listener examples with one of the machines being accessed by ssh.
Both my machines have ROS Eloquent installed and I would like to have my local machine A talking with the remote machine B, which I have access through ssh. I am using a VPN so that both machines are under the same network.
So far, I haven't been able to do this and so I would like to know if it's even possible.
Thank you

You mean "in the same network", correct? Two machines with the same IP would not be able to communicate.

yes, sorry. Already edited my question.

A:

This is a really interesting question, and I personally have not done this myself. However, the ROS wiki on Remote Machines claims that it possible, with a few caveats.

Your ISP (internet service provider) allows for port forwarding.
The devices communicate with each other via Public IPs, which may change dynamically.
It has a lot of network configuration and setup outside of ROS, and the wiki link provided above tries to explain some of the problems faced.

Hope this helps.

This helps yes. It seems super complicated but possible.
Thank you very much!

If you're using a VPN, port forwarding should not be needed.
@PedroACaldeira: you will have to make sure your VPN supports forwarding/routing UDP traffic though.
