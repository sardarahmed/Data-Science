Q:

Need help understanding urdf and tf

I've worked through the tutorials on urdf and am working through tf. I have created a urdf for my physical robot. I am striving to get my robot set up to use the Nav stack and somehow had in my mind that the urdf is required and a step towards setting up the transforms for the robot, but if I read that somewhere I cannot now find it and am having a hard time getting my head wrapped around this. I understand why I need transforms, I'm starting to understand how to write the code for the transforms, I am quite confident in my abilities writing a urdf, but I don't see where, if anywhere, the two come together. Do I even need a urdf for a physical robot? I feel I am missing a big BIG part of the picture here and could use a good explanation or at least a nudge in the right direction.

 yup. Figured that one out about two weeks ago, just forgot to come back and close out the question. Thanks for the help though!

Thanks, marking the question with the checkbox is enough. It implicitly closes the question.
