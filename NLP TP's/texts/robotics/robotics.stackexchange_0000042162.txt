Q:

Message encoding

Is there any documentation about how ROS serializes/encodes messages over a network? E.g. is it some binary format? XML? etc.
I don't have an install of ROS handy so I'd rather not have to set it up and run Wireshark or something. Thanks for any help!

A:

The ROS/Connection Header page should contain some of the information you're after.

Edit (I was curious as well): How to know where the next variable begins in a serialized message? seems related.
