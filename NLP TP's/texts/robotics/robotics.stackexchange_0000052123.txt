Q:

non-fully-qualified-frame_id how to fix?

Hi @All,
please can you explain me, whats the the reason for this warning and how to fix it.
I get this [WARN][...]: Message from [/laserscanner-tcp] has a non-fully-qualified frame_id [laser]. Resolved locally to [/laser]...
Allthough its a warning I ignored but maybe its a good idea to fix it, but have no idea how.
Thanks
Michael

A:

It's missing a tf prefix. The frame id laser could be resolved to /laser (a "world-wide" frame id) or /robot_a/laser (a robot-specific frame id).
If there is not tf prefix (i.e. you are not doing multirobot stuff) resolving laser to /laser is fine and shouldn't give you any problems.
