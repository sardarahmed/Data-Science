Q:

could gmapping pkg work in UWSim?

Hey guys,I am trying to do path planning using UWSim + RViz.And now there's something wrong with mapping.I followed some tutorials which is implemented by Gazebo+RViz and I also get the necessary lidar data through UWSim ROSInterfaces.However the map just won't come up.

Here is the tf tree of the current master:

A:

As far as I know Gmapping is designed for 2D occupancy grids, but your robot probably moves in 3D.
You need another SLAM tool to build 3D maps (e.g. octomaps), and again probably some dedicated tools to do path planning in such maps.
