Q:

SDL image error while building gmapping

While building the gmapping package in my embedded system (odroid-x), i got this error:
Building CXX object CMakeFiles/image_loader.dir/src/image_loader.o
/home/linaro/ros/navigation/map_server/src/image_loader.cpp:43:27: fatal error: SDL/SDL_image.h: No such file or directory
It seems that I do not have the SDL_image.h file. If i download the file, where go i have to place it in? However it run just fine in my laptop. Can anyone tell me whats the problem? Thanks!

A:

I had the same issue when building the navigation stack,you can use the Synaptic to install not only the package libsdl-image but also the libsdl-image-dev!
