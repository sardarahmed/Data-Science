Q:

optimal kinect/xtion placement with regard to object recognition

Hi!
I am wondering, if there is some kind of best practice out there or someone could share her/his experience about how to best place the Kinect, Xtion or a similar device on a robot.
To be more specific, I am thinking about which viewing angle is necessary to get good results for object recognition, e.g. with objects on a table.
Is there an optimal viewing angle - maybe 45 degrees?
I would be happy, if somebody doing table-top manipulation, e.g. with the PR2 + Kinect, could tell me about the viewing angles for which object recognition works well.
Thank you!

A:

well, it all depends on the technique you use, it is that simple: template techniques like LINEMOD will need the same view points that you acquired during training, feature based ones can be a bit more robust to warping and so on.
Train your detector in angle/scale/illumination in the same way you will detect your object and accuracy will increase.
