Q:

Installing packages on Mac OS X

How can I install ROS package on Mac OS X?
This is the command used on Ubuntu system:

sudo apt-get install ros-jade-gmapping ros-jade-amcl ros-jade-map-server ros-jade-move-base ros-jade-rviz ros-jade-navigation

How can I install the same packages on my Mac machine?
Thanks

A:

To install ROS on OSX, you'll have to build things from source. See the Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source for instructions.
A good alternative manual / installation procedure is Mike Purvis' ros-install-osx (it basically does the same thing, but a bit more automated).

I already have ROS installed. I just need to install additional packages. I don't have apt-get on Mac.
