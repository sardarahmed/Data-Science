Q:

How do I use other packages while writing my own package

Im just starting out with ros2, and I have been trying to do something that I thought would be very common.
I want to use the functions available inside some other package in my own node. The package in questions is ld08_driver lds-02 lidar driver github link and I see that inside the /include/lipkg.h file, I see that there are functions like GetSpeed, GetTimestamp and so on.
What I’m asking is, is it not possible to do something like how rclpy is imported and used, “Import ld08_driver” and just use those functions and not use the pre-created node?
I do realize the question is not very well structured, but please understand I am just starting out, and haven’t found any solution by Google searches.
I’m using ros2 foxy and for now, plan to use the lidar standalone with no real purpose, just testing various codes, instead of working with simulations.

A:

The package you refer to is written in c++, not in python.
You can't simply mix c++ and python.
You can start a python node, and you can start a c++ node, and they can participate in the same ROS graph (i.e. they can publish and subscribe to each other's topics, or provide services and clients, etc), as long as they are both of the same ROS version and use the same RMW implementation. But if you'd want to import some c++ source code to use that function inside your python node, then the only option is to study the code and rewrite that functionality in python.
If you want to learn c++, I can recommend learncpp.com.
Then go through the c++ ROS 2 tutorials.
In order to learn how to import python packages in your project, have a look at:

The creating a package tutorial,
The other ROS 2 Python tutorials, e.g. creating a publisher and subscriber, or service and client,
The python demos
General other examples, e.g. this previous ROS Answers question.
