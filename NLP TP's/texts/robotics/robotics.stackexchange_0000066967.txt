Q:

Landmark updates in robot_localization

I am currently obtaining landmark updates for odometry which are not continuous position data and provide with discrete jumps in the position data. The 'robot_localization' documentation mentions that the 'navsat_transform_node'  essentially takes in the GPS data and converts it to an odometry message in the 'world frame'.
I have the two following questions with respect to this:

What is the 'world frame' for the
output odometry in this node?
Will
the landmark updates for state
estimation required to be with
respect to the odom frame or
map frame? (because they are
discrete position updates)

A:

First, see my answer to this question, which I think is similar to yours.
Second, are you taking in landmark updates to provide a (potentially discontinuous) pose estimate, or are you using GPS? navsat_transform_node is only necessary if you are working with GPS data.
A typical use case would be:

ekf_localization_node or ukf_localization_node instance one: fuse continuous measurement source, e.g., odometry and IMU data. The world_frame for this instance is the same value as your odom_frame; this is typically odom. Alternatively, some robots provide an odometry message and the odom->base_link transform. This is typically less accurate than a solution with fused data sources, but it may fit you needs.
ekf_localization_node or ukf_localization_node instance two: fuse the same data as in instance one, but also fuse discontinuous sources like GPS or position updates from landmark observations. The world_frame for this instance is the same value as your map_frame; this is typically map. This instance is really only necessary if you have discontinuous measurement sources.

To more directly answer your question, for navsat_transform_node, the frame_id of the /odometry/gps message that gets created is depedent on the frame_id of the odometry message that gets fed to it.
