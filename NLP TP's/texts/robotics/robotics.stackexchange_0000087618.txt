Q:

How to run the Topics RViz plugin

Continuing the discussion from Topics RViz plugin:
You can check the package here
Hello.
I’m a beginner on ROS. So, I have this question.
I downloaded this plugin at my workspace. After build it using catkin_make, I tried to run this plugin directly.
But, I can’t it. The prompt can not found binary file for this plugin.
I checked CMakeLists.txt and package.xml. But, I don’t know how to run this exactly.
It sounds like a basic question about ros, could you tell me how to fix this?
// ENV: Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic

A:

This is a plugin for rviz, not a standalone program, so you load it from within rviz.
After you've built the package and sourced the workspace where you built it, start rviz. There should be a Panel menu, and from there you should be able to find a menu option that will let you add the Topics panel to the rviz display.
