Q:

Could not find method group() for arguments [ros.rosjava_core]

Hi,
I'm trying to install the rosjava_core with the "gradle install", but I'm getting the next error:
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

Where:
Build file '/home/user/my_workspace/rosjava_core/build.gradle' line: 22

What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating root project 'rosjava_core'.
Cause: Could not find method group() for arguments [ros.rosjava_core] on root project 'rosjava_core'
--

In the build.gradle I have it:
...
allprojects {
group 'ros.rosjava_core'
version = '0.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
...
How should I configure that file? Any suggestion?
Thanks

A:

Maybe you're using the wrong version of gradle? You should execute the gradle wrapper (rosjava_core/gradlew). You should not need to modify rosjava_core/build.gradle.
