Q:

Doubts regarding gmapping

Hi. I have some doubts regarding gmapping. On the wiki page, it is stated that gmapping make use of both laserscan and odometry data to build a map. However,it seems that the slam_mapping node only subscribe to “scan” topic but not to “odom” topic. So, is it that we only need to set the “odom_frame” parameter when launching gmapping to “odom” so that the gmapping receive odometry data? Thank you.

A:

gmapping receives the odometry information in the form of a transform from the odom frame to the base_link frame. You need another package (for example robot_pose_ekf) publishing that transform in order for gmapping to work.

Thanks Ivan! I have always thought of odometry information as a stream of msg. Seems like I am wrong.

Odometry is a stream of messages on the /odom topic. But in ROS, an odometry node is also supposed to continuously publish the transform odom -> base_link and that's what, for instance, the robot_pose_ekf node does after fusing /odom and IMU data.
