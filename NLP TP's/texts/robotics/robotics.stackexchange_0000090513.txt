Q:

Changing the verbosity of rosout.log file

I've been digging further into the log files under ~.ros/log and am interested in changing the verbosity of what appears there. As an example, a driver node for an Ensenso camera is generating output like this in the main rosout.log file:
1550159090.698210207 ERROR [/home/jlangsfeld/Workspaces/mcc_deboning/src/ensenso_ros_driver/ensenso_camera/src/camera.cpp:221(open) [topics: /rosout, /tf, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/compressedDepth, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/compressedDepth/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/compressed, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/compressed/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/compressed/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/theora, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/theora/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/raw/left/image/theora/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/raw/left/camera_info, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/compressedDepth, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/compressedDepth/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/compressed, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/compressed/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/compressed/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/theora, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/theora/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/raw/right/image/theora/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/raw/right/camera_info, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/compressedDepth, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/compressedDepth/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/compressed, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/compressed/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/compressed/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/theora, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/theora/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/image/theora/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/rectified/left/camera_info, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/compressedDepth, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/compressedDepth/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/compressed, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/compressed/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/compressed/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/theora, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/theora/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/image/theora/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/rectified/right/camera_info, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/compressedDepth, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/compressedDepth/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/compressed, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/compressed/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/compressed/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/disparity_map, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/theora, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/theora/parameter_descriptions, /ensenso_front/disparity_map/theora/parameter_updates, /ensenso_front/cloud, /diagnostics] The camera '182089' could not be found

As you can, this is just an unnecessary wall of noise. How can I change the format to exclude the topics list and possibly the line number as well? The environment variable mentioned here only changes what appears on stderr in the terminal and doesn't affect the file.
Note also that I'm running this node from a launch file without output="screen" but I'm still getting this output only in rosout.log and not in the node's log file. In fact nothing appears in the node's log file except a single INFO statement. Is this expected?

I think not. I remember looking into this in the past.

A:

After some more searching, I discovered this issue has already been addressed for melodic. The global parameter /rosout_disable_topics_generation can be used to make the topic lists empty. Or, the /rosout/omit_topics parameter will prevent the list from appearing in rosout.log at all.

I'll add this to "reasons to upgrade Ubuntu"
