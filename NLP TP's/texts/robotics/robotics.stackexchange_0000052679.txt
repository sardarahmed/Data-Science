Q:

How save point clouds in .txt file with rgbdslam

Hi,
I use rgbdslam to capture point clouds, these clouds are saved as .PCD file. How to save them in .txt file?
I'm also confused about which topic published these clouds. When I press "enter" to save the cloud is not published anything in /rgbdslam/batch_clouds is published only in /rgbdslam/aggregate_clouds.
Sorry for possible grammar errors. Thanks.

when you got a .pcd file, you just modify the file name from the .pcd to .txt.and you can use the .txt to read data . hope use for you .

Was very simple, thanks. Another option save in .ply file.

A:

"Enter" doesn't save the cloud. It processes one. You need to select "Data->Save PC as...", then enter a filename that ends with .ply, e.g. cloud.ply
The file will be in ply format, which is a text based format.

Sorry, I expressed the wrong way. Really, I saved the clouds "Data-> Save the PC ..." as you said. Thanks for the tip save in ply.
But I'm still a little confused about the publication of the topics.

Why do you expect rgbdslam to send the clouds on "batch_clouds"?
Comment by lf.wil on 2013-07-28:
Cause I read the tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam): "Most people seem to want the registered point cloud. It is by default sent out on /rgbdslam/batch_clouds when you command RGB-D SLAM..." and this led me questions. I intend to manipulate these point clouds jointly with another online algorithm. Currently working with data offline.

It is sent out if you tell rgbdslam so, by selecting "Data->send model", not by saving to disk (Data->Save the PC).
