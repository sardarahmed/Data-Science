Q:

Error: stack/package nxt_python not found

I have just installed Ubuntu 11.10, and installed ROS. Then I tried to setup ros_nxt http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/NXT/electric
To verify the setup, I run nxt_python, but got the following error.
$ rosrun nxt_python touch_sensor_test.py 
[rospack] Error: stack/package nxt_python not found

I tried roscd and got the same error, but rosls works
$ rosls nxt_python
Desktop    Downloads         Music     Public     Videos
Documents  examples.desktop  Pictures  Templates
$ roscd nxt_python
roscd: No such package/stack 'nxt_python'

any suggestion to debugging this problem?

A:

It sounds like you don't have your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable set up correctly.
Take a look at http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment and http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
