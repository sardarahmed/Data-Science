Q:

Doubt in documentation job

My pull request for indigo,melodic and lunar were merged two days ago for addition in documentation index. Melodic and indigo documentation appears on ROS Wiki but lunar does not appear.
http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_keyboard_omni3
I also checked the doc job and it shows no build.
http://build.ros.org/job/Ldoc__teleop_keyboard_omni3__ubuntu_xenial_amd64/
The devel job was built 2days ago.
http://build.ros.org/job/Ldev__teleop_keyboard_omni3__ubuntu_xenial_amd64/
Do I need to do something or is something wrong ?

From what I can tell, everything should be fine. The doc entries for Lunar in distribution.yaml look ok.
As I wrote in #q317691, doc jobs are run once every three days, so it could be that yours is waiting to be run, or we're just at the end of the three day period.
Your enthusiasm is great to see, but I'd suggest to wait a little longer.

Melodic and indigo documentation appears on ROS Wiki but lunar does not appear.

Note: all jobs on the buildfarm are independent, in the sense that there are separate jobs for the documentation generation for the Indigo, Kinetic and Lunar versions of your package. The fact that some have been run already while others haven't doesn't necessarily point to something being wrong.

Is there a way to know which package is currently running in the buildfarm. Also do the packages run alphabetically ?

Please do not ask follow-up questions in comments under (previously) accepted answers.
Comments have very limited visibility, and in addition ROS Answers works best with a 1-to-1 ratio of questions and answers. This is not a regular forum.
