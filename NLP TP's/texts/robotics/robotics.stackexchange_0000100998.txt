Q:

I can't find  in the dynamic_reconfigure package

Hi all,
I'm learning ROS using the tutorial section. Right now I'm doing this one: http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure/Tutorials/SettingUpDynamicReconfigureForANode%28cpp%29.
I understand that dynamic_reconfigure is the package with the tools I need to use, but I can't find this server.h header. I did
rospack find dynamic_reconfigure 

and the path is: /opt/ros/melodic/share/dynamic_reconfigure. Then, if I do:
ls /opt/ros/melodic/share/dynamic_reconfigure

I get: cmake  msg  package.xml  srv  templates. No sign of server.h ! I've already built and run the node, as the tutorial suggested, and it seems to work. For example, I can find dynamic_tutorials/TutorialsConfig.h in devel/include/dynamic_tutorials.
What am I missing?

Hi @alberto, can you please post the exact error displayed.

Hi @osilva, I don't have any error. I'm new to ROS, and I want to understand this thing: since the tutorial says:
#include <dynamic_reconfigure/server.h>

I expect to go in the dynamic_reconfigure directory and to find the server.h file, but there isn't any server.h in there. So how can this include work without error? Where is this server.h file? Maybe it's just a dumb question, but I can't find the answer..

Hi @alberto, it's part of dynamic_reconfigure package, check this link that shows the source code for location of server.h

A definitely not a dumb question. It takes time to get used to how the packages work.

Hi @alberto
You may find the server.h file in this folder:
opt\ros\melodic\include\dynamic_reconfigure

Also you can see the source code here for location of server.h

This answer would be improved if it explained the general layout of the /opt/ros FHS prefix. See REP 122: Filesystem Hierarchy Standard layout changes for ROS for information.
Headers are never present in /opt/ros/$ROS_VERSION/share. Only in /opt/ros/$ROS_VERSION/include.

Thank you both!
Now I understand, using rospack find I get the path with ../share/.. and it's correct, in fact reading @gvdhoorn link, it says that: All architecture-independent package-relative assets are explicitly installed to share/ros-package-name. But all the headers are installed  in the include directory. In fact searching the ../include/.. I find the server.h. Thank you again!

Glad it worked out @alberto. And @gvdhoorn thank for adding the additional information and taking time to improve the answer.
