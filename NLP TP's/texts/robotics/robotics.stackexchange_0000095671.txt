Q:

cv_bridge Package Downloaded, Still Getting Error in ROS Setup

Error:
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cv_bridge" with
any of the following names:
cv_bridgeConfig.cmake
cv_bridge-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "cv_bridge" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"cv_bridge_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"cv_bridge" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
been installed.

Have you completed the 4th step here?

You need to add cv_bridge package to your CMakelists.txt and package.xml files.
I would also recommend you to follow this tutorial, you can see how to create a package by adding cv_bridge as a dependency.
