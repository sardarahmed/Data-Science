Q:

Frames and TFs are disappearing

I have two robot models. The first robot is the vehicle (AR.Drone) and the second is the Phantom Omni Device. I use rviz for visualization. I have problem with the tree of the TFs. Now for the AR.Drone, the parent  frame is the 'world' frame while the parent frame for the Phantom Omni is the base frame. Now there are two problems. The first one is that when the TFs are shown in Rviz, the world frame appear for 3 seconds and starts to disappear. The second problem, the base TF is not shown. I want both robots to be shown with their URDF files but RViz only allow us to choose one Fixed frame.. What should I do ?

In RViz, go the the TF tree drop-down menu and increase the timeout time.

This solves my first problem.
It worked! Thanks but I really would like to know from where I should specify the time line in the code or the launch file ??

You can save your rviz config and load it from a launch file.
