Q:

Examples of Zeno Behaviour in the Real World

Zeno Behaviour or Zeno Phenomenon can be informally stated as the behavior of a system making an infinite number of jumps in a finite amount of time.
While this is an important Control system problem in ideal systems, can Zeno behavior exist in real systems? Any examples?
If so, why don't noise or external factors deviate a system from achieving Zeno?

A:

To the principal question, "can Zeno behavior exist in real systems?" the answer is no.
Real systems don't do any infinite anything. The Quantum Zeno Effect, a.k.a. Turing paradox, is a purely quantum phenomenon. In this robotics forum, real systems are macroscopic, and macroscopic systems don't do any quantum anything. Hence, there are no examples and no need to explain about noise.
If you want to get all reductionist and want to explain how macroscopic phenomena arise from quantum behavior, or how the infinities and/or infinitesimals of differential equations are used to describe real behavior, I'll have to send you to some other StackExchange site.
