Q:

`Message No map received` in Rviz

Hi,
I try to build a map in Rviz using turtlebot simulation in gazebo. First I create a package and write a launch file which open GAZEBO world and turtlebot in that environment ...
That is the Launch file
<launch>

 <node name="gazebo" pkg="gazebo" type="gazebo" args="-u $(find gazebo_worlds)/worlds/simple_office.world"/>

 <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/>

 <node name="gazebo_gui" pkg="gazebo" type="gui"/>

 <include file="$(find turtlebot_gazebo)/launch/robot.launch"/>

 <include file="$(find turtlebot_teleop)/keyboard_teleop.launch"/>

</launch>

Then I run rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan _odom_frame:=odom_combined
Then open Rviz with rosrun rviz rviz -d 'rospack find turtlebot_navigation' /nav_rviz.vcg , this command does not open plugins required for gmapping as it can not locate nav_rviz.vcg, so finally I open rviz from launch file
<launch>

 <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="$(anon rviz)" args="-d $(find turtlebot_navigation)/nav_rviz.vcg">  </node>

</launch>

It work well at lest it run all requirements for gmapping ....
The problem now that when I move robot in gazebo, robot move in rviz too but does not make a map, and I find that massage in rviz : Message No map received
Edit
I write this command
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan _odom_frame:=odom_combined

and nothing else in is written in terminal
see warning 
All nodes that run and topics
Edit2
That is the map
but I think it will not accurate if there is more details in the environment and It seems to be footprints !!
Edit3
Hi, I have a problem now, when I open RVIZ it seem there is a problem in laser scan, map, robot model, and tf here is
do not know which file I have to check gyro in !!
That is the error
any suggestion ,
Thanks

Can you check if there is laser data?
Comment by Amal on 2013-03-04:
how to do this ?!
Comment by dornhege on 2013-03-04:
The simplest way would be an rviz display.

Please open a new question if a new problem arises.

OK, Thanks I solve this problem now

A:

Remove the remapping of scan to base_scan. You are publishing the laser on /scan, so no remapping is needed.
