Q:

Is kobuki a holonomic robot?

Hi, all, I am writing a local planner for turtelbot2, i.e. kobuki robot.
But I am not sure is it a holonomic robot. From the wikipedia
I think kobuki is a holonomic robot, isn't it.

A:

No, it isn't. According to wikipedia, A robot is holonomic if the controllable degrees of freedom are equal to the total degrees of freedom. As a ground robot, the degrees of freedom are 3, the x axis, y axis, and rotation about the origin. But the controllable degrees of freedom are only 2, the linear and angular velocities.
