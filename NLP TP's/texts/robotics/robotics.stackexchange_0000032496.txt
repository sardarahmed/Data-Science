Q:

rosjava(android) pubsub tutorial

I build rosjava pubsub tutorial without error. and I can run the PubSubTutorial on the AVD.
It seems working well. but I don't know it is actually publishing the topic.
I ran the roscore in ubuntu PC, but PubSubTutorial is not trying to connect to roscore in PC.
MainActivity Manifest has internet permission.
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>

Should I run the roscore(rosjava)? the DEFAULT_MASTER_URI is "http://localhost:11311/" was configured by NodeRunner.createDefault() function.
[2011-06-23 22:41:19 - MainActivity] Android Launch!
[2011-06-23 22:41:19 - MainActivity] adb is running normally.

[2011-06-23 22:41:22 - MainActivity] ActivityManager: Starting: Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN cat=[android.intent.category.LAUNCHER] cmp=org.ros.tutorials.pubsub/.MainActivity }

How can I use this tutorial?
Please give me a answer. Thank you.

Could you clarify your question? You say that it built and runs fine on the AVD. Your logcat looks fine as well.

A:

To connect to a roscore that is running in an AVD, you'll need to use adb forwarding. See http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html#forwardports
For example:
adb forward tcp:11311 tcp:11311
That will forward all TCP connections to port 11311 on your host to your AVD on port 11311.
