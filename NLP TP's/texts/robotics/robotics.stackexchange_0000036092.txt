Q:

How to get started with iRobot Roomba?

I have just bought Roomba 530 as a vacuum cleaner until I realise it can be used as a personal robot for hobby and learning purposes.
I have visited this page - (http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/Roomba) - but the links under installation are not working.
I am an absolute newbie in programming Roomba or any robots in general.  Please point me to a step-by-step guide.
Thank you.

yes you are missing something :) You have to hack it. There is a mini-DIN port which allows a TTL serial connection. To that you can hook up a serial to USB or serial to wifi or serial to whatever. Google it.

My iRobot Roomba 530 is being charged for the first time for 16 hours.  In the meantime, reading the user manual from front to back does not tell me it has wifi or bluetooth or even usb port support.  Have I missed something?

That sounds great.  Thank you.
I will update back when I have attempted any or both of the above successfully or not.

You don't modify any roomba software. You just talk to it through a serial connection. You can either do it wirelessly (XBee, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc) or like Turtlebot, you just hook a laptop/netbook up to it via USB serial port.

Thanks, Kevin.
Obviously, I have not gone through the page in details. Can I ask if there is a utility to backup and restore the original installed software in the iRobot so that it can continue to function as a vacuum cleaner?
