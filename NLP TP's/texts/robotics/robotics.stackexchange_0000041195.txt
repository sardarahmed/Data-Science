Q:

SLAM without odometry: gmapping or hector_slam?

Hello,
I am looking for a SLAM that does not require odometry to perform, only laser scans. I have noticed 2 solutions so far: gmapping (+laser_scan_matcher) and hector_slam.
If I am in the right direction, what are the differences between both?

A:

Both gmapping/laser_scan_matcher and hector_slam are viable options that have been demonstrated to work well in different scenarios (see also this Q/A). It might make sense to just try both for your setup and see what works best. Depending on LIDAR type, size/characteristics of the enviroment, available computing resources and other factors you might get better results with one approach or the other.

Stefan: Does gmapping work without odom as well?

You can generate fake odometry by using the laser_scan_matcher, so using a combination of gmapping/laser_scan_matcher is method not requiring (real) odometry.

Thanks Stefan :)

Thanks a lot ! Indeed I guess I will have try both solutions.
