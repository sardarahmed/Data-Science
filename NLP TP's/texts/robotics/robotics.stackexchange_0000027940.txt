Q:

Unable to call parseURDF on robot model

Hi,
I'm new to gazebo. Just installed whole software on Ubuntu14 with this one-line command
curl -ssL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh

Gazebo starts fine, I was able to create a model consisting of 1 cylinder and save it as:
balewski@ubuntu:~$ ll model_editor_models/Untitled/
-rw-rw-r-- 1 balewski balewski  237 Oct 31 21:30 model.config
-rw-rw-r-- 1 balewski balewski 2947 Oct 31 21:30 model.sdf

But when I try to load it next time with this command as see the error as below and  the cylinder is not showing up.
$ gazebo model_editor_models/Untitled/model.config 
Error [parser_urdf.cc:3423] Unable to call parseURDF on robot model
Error [parser.cc:309] parse as old deprecated model file failed.

Can you please advise me how to save/read-in my model or what software I am missing?
Thanks
Jan

A:

(Even if your model.config setup is good)
This error can appear if there is an error in your urdf model, not a parsing error but another type, e.g. :

It could be that you have multiple joints with the same name
links with no parent and therefore not connected to the tree
etc...

A quick way to check your urdf model is to do:
    check_urdf <(xacro model.urdf.xacro)
