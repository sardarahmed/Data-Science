Q:

rgbdslam compiles but I get an error trying to run it

Since the build gets to 100% I try
$ roslaunch rgbdslam openni+rgbdslam.launch

[openni+rgbdslam.launch] is neither a launch file in package [rgbdslam] nor is [rgbdslam] a launch file name The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
How do I get past this?

A:

Did you source your workspace once it was built?
try:
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch rgbdslam openni+rgbdslam.launch
