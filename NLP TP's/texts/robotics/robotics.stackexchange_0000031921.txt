Q:

newly installed stack not yet working - what did I miss?

Hi everyone
I'm trying to get a newly installed stack to work, it's my first time so be gentle :).
The package I would like to install is gpsd_client.
So I used following command, with the stack name found here
sudo apt-get install ros-unstable-gps-umd
and this seems to run through properly. If I run it again it says "ros-unstable-gps-umd is already the newest version", so that sound good.
If I then run
rosrun gpsd_client gpsd_client _host:=localhost _port:=2947
I get the error "[rospack] couldn't find package [gpsd_client]". What did I miss? And where did the installed files go? Intuitively I would expect to /opt/ros/releasename/stacks ... but there I dont find it.

Comment by Ivan Dryanovski on 2011-05-29:
Which version of ROS did you install - unstable or diamondback? If you installed unstable, everything should be in /opt/ros/unstable/stacks. If you installed diamondback, you should probably use ros-diamondback-gps-umd instead.

A:

I have diamondback installed but didn't understand that "unstable" is referred to the ROS version. Now that I know this is trivial.
ros-diamondback-gps-umd
did the trick.
Thanks a lot, Dryanovski
