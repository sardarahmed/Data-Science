Q:

Alternative to ur_description on ros-melodic?

Hey,
I am running ubuntu 18.04 with ros-melodic
When I am trying to run an old code I get an error saying ur_description was not found.
when I went to the documentation on roswiki I think that ur_description was available only till ros-kinetic.
So is there any alternative that will work the same in ros-melodic?
sushilsundaram@cmu:~/Documents/ros_course/hrwros_ws/src/hrwros_support/urdf$ rosrun xacro xacro hrwros.xacro > hrwros.urdf 
resource not found: ur_description
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros

Edit: Hey, Thanks for the reply and the help.

Edit your original question text.

You can still build universal_robot on Melodic in a Catkin workspace.
See #q252478 for the general procedure (but of course use melodic instead of kinetic).

Edit:

sushilsundaram@cmu:~/Documents/ros_course/hrwros_ws/src/hrwros_support/urdf$ rosdep check -i --from-paths $HOME/Documents/ros_course/hrwros_ws/src

All system dependencies have been satisfied
ERROR[hrwros_support]: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [turtlebot_description]
    rosdep key : turtlebot_description
    OS name    : ubuntu
    OS version : bionic
    Data: <no data>

This would seem to be only one dependency (instead of "far too many").
The problem here is that hrwros_support depends on turtlebot_description which hasn't been released into Melodic yet.
It has only very few dependencies (looking at the wiki page), so you could try adding turtlebot_description (together with its dependencies) in your workspace and fulfill the dependency requirements that way.
Do note though: as far as I know, the packages in HRWROS were specifically created for Kinetic, so the problems that you're running into getting this to work on Melodic are somewhat expected. There is also no guarantee that after you get your workspace to build, the whole setup will actually work.

Hey
Thanks for the reply. The issue with this method is there are far too many dependencies that haven't been ported.
If there is no other alternative then I'll just have to do it this way.

Your comment surprises me, because I build the entire set of universal_robot packages on Melodic just about every week.
If you can show what the output of
rosdep check -i --from-paths $HOME/Documents/ros_course/hrwros_ws/src

is, perhaps we can see what the problem is.

I just figured out that it wasn't the problem with the universal_robot clone having issues it was a problem with my urdf needing more dependencies.
Thanks a lot for all the help.

What dependencies were you missing? Can you elaborate on how you solved your issue?
