Q:

simulate pioneer3at

Hi, I'm new in ros and I have the following question:
I want to simulate a robot pioneer3at, but when I put in the terminal:
p2os roslaunch ... all I get is pioneer3dx.gazebo.launch
how I can simulate the robot pioneer3at?
Thanks

A:

You can find working simulation at https://github.com/allenh1/p2os (roslaunch p2os_urdf pioneer3at.gazebo.launch). But you will need current Gazebo (1.8.6) and gazebo_ros_pkgs. If using model from gazebo_models, you will not get cmd_vel and odometry topics.

Thanks for your answers. ZdenekM, as you said, you need current Gazebo (1.8.6) and gazebo_ros_pkgs, but gazebo_ros_pkgs is only under ros Hydro. There is any way to work with gazebo 1.8.6 + ROS Groovy and Pioneer3AT?
Thanks in advance.
