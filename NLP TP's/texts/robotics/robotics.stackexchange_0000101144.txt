Q:

ament_cpplint: Relative paths like . and .. are not allowed

Some of my ROS2 Rolling CIs started failing today against the ament_cpplint test. I have my_package with two files in the src/ directory: my_class.cpp and my_class.hpp. The line caught by ament_cpplint is the line #include "./my_class.hpp in my_class.cpp.
The error is:
my_package/src/my_class.cpp should include its header file my_package/src/my_class.hpp. Relative paths like . and .. are not allowed.  [build/include] [5]

From memory, the reason I had the leading ./ was that it supressed a stange issue in ament_cpplint about including relative directories. However, I see in a recent PR for rclcpp, they remove the leading ./ from the includes. Has this issue been resolved such that we can use just use #include "my_class.hpp"?

A:

To answer my own question,
Changing #include "./my_class.hpp" to #include "my_class.hpp" simply solves the problem.
