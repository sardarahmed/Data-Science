Do you have the packages turtlebot_description and xacro installed on your system ?
Comment by mjcarroll on 2013-05-20:
Can you explain what operating system you are on?  Your path seems to indicate that you did a source install on your system.  I believe that you will have a much easier time using the precompiled binaries if you are using Ubuntu.

Thank you for your response. My operating system is Ubuntu 12.04, but I don't know what you mean "Your path seems to indicate that you did .... precompiled binaries if you are using Ubuntu". Can you explain more detail? Thank you.
Comment by mjcarroll on 2013-05-22:
Are you using Ubuntu on a normal x86/x64 computer?  If that is the case, then you should follow the instructions here to install ROS: http://ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu
Comment by CharlesLiou on 2013-05-22:
I use ubuntu on PandaBoard and follow the tutorial to install ROS: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/PandaBoard/Source

Thank you, CarolineQ.
I have turtlebot_description package and install xacro package after your suggestion. Then, I launch "rosluanch turtlebot_bring minimal.launch" again. But still have some error when I launch. Following message is the error message::

Don't you have any other message before this one ? I mean, I got this error few times, most of the time there was another line before that saying "package X is missing". This package could be for example kobuki_description... Did you install ROS with a full install ?
Comment by CharlesLiou on 2013-05-21:
The bold type is the all message when I launch "rosluanch turtlebot_bring minimal.launch", but it doesn't seem to miss package. I follow this tutorial "http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/PandaBoard/Source" to install ROS.
Comment by CharlesLiou on 2013-05-21:
In the tutorial step 3.1.1 Create a catkin Workspace, I install Robot (not ROS_Comm)
Comment by CarolineQ on 2013-05-21:
"ResourceNotFound: create_description" : You need to install the create_description package.
Comment by CharlesLiou on 2013-05-22:
Thank CarolineQ! I already install create_description package.Then, another error: "ResourceNotFound: kobuki_description". But I can't install this package, I download this package from here "http://www.ros.org/wiki/kobuki_description", using "git clone".
Comment by CharlesLiou on 2013-05-22:
After download it, I export ros path to "kobuki". But i still can't find "kobuki_description" package when I use "rospack find kobuki_description"
Comment by CarolineQ on 2013-05-22:
Maybe you need to build the package kobuki_description with make or rosmake. If you are using Ubuntu, is it not possible to do "sudo apt-get install kobuki" ?
Comment by CharlesLiou on 2013-05-24:
Sorry, I don't know how to build the package which I use "git clone" from here "http://www.ros.org/wiki/kobuki"...
Comment by CarolineQ on 2013-05-26:
You can go into the package kobuki_description and try to do a rosmake.
But before that did you try to do "sudo apt-get install kobuki" ?
Comment by CharlesLiou on 2013-05-27:
I think I find the reason why I can't rosmake "kobuki_description". Because the "kobuki_description" folder doesn't have "Makefile". On the other hand, I can't use "sudo apt-get install kobuki" to install kobuki, this is error I get "Unable to locate package kobuki"
