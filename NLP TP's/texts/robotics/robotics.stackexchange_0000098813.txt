Q:

Raspi 4 with Noetic & 64bit compatible?

I am trying to run Noetic on a 64bit RPi Ubuntu/Focal server version, but the following error does occur:
$ uname -a
Linux robot 5.4.0-1033-raspi #36-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Thu Mar 25 19:00:51 UTC 2021 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
Executing: /tmp/apt-key-gpghome.wGbRJBPKZs/gpg.1.sh --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
gpg: keyserver receive failed: No keyserver available

Any idea why this is not working? On the installation page, the aarch64 architecture is only listed for arch/experimental. But I have read plenty of blogs which mentioned that this setup would work. Any hint? Thx a lot!

Solved it thanks to this answer.
Summarizing it here for convenience:

Add the following line to /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8 # Google dns

Cheers!

Seems like a work-around to me, but if you're happy, we're happy.
