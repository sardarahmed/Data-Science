Q:

How can I tell the distance from a turtlebot to an obstacle?

Hi all,
I am working on obstacle avoidance using turtlebot with kinect sensor. I need help with determining how far an obstacle is from the turtlebot. I want to use this process to incorporate it into a multiple robots where they will move and avoid obstacles.

I see three main ways do to what you want:

convert the depth image provided by kinect into a laser scan with depthimage_to_laserscan and get the smallest range
process directly the depth image, for example looking for the lowest intensity pixel. For best performance, use a computer vision library as OpenCV
process directly the pointcloud that kinect can also provide, possibly using PCL

An example for way 3 is the turtlebot_follower: doesn't look for the closest obstacle, but for any significatively big obstacle in front of the robot (and follows it). But probably use PCL is a bit overkilling for simple obstacle avoidance....
An example for way 2 is....  the same! I have seem @Tully Foote has rewritten turtlebot_follower in kinetic to use depth image procesed with OpenCV (not 100% sure) instead of PCL
That said, your question is rather vague... can you provide some more details about your plans?

We are working on a multiple turtlebots for formation change. Our plan is to be able to change formation when there is a barrier so multiple robots can pass through a gate.

is there a code in c++ out there I can use for reference? We are planning to do an obstacle avoidance where we will expand into multi turtlebots.

based on method 1. depthimage_to_laserscan how can I detect how far a target is?
