Q:

amcl parameters and robot localization without 2D Pose Estimate tool

so, during navigation we run amcl and move_base. And at first we need to estimate robot's position in Rviz using "2D Pose Estimate" tool. Why do we need to do this? Why do we need to help amcl node to determine robot position?

Maybe I dont understand something about localization, but it looks absolutely unusable. Is there any way to localize robot without clicking by mouse?

I see a lot of parameters in amcl.launch such as laser_z_rand or laser_z_hit or laser_likelihood_max_dist. And ros wiki describes them very briefly. Where can I find full information about those parameters?

A:

Asking a robot to localize itself with no prior knowledge has a special name -- "the kidnapped robot problem". As you can imagine, when something has acquired a specific name, it's quite difficult. The algorithm in AMCL is very good at maintaining localization when it has a good prior, decent odometry updates, and the laser can see things to correct for odometry errors/slippage/etc.
Typically, the work around people implement to avoid having to give initial localization is to use other means to get an initial estimate. This could be a wifi thumbprint that tells you roughly where the robot is, some sort of visual indicator, etc. I'm not aware of any maintained, public implementations of such things though.
