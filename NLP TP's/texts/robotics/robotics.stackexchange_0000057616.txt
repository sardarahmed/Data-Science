Q:

No Data from MAVLink_ROS

Hi, I plan to use MAVLink-ROS to read the IMU data from APM2.5. Although it compiles sucessfully by rosmake, the data cannot be received. I use rqt_graph to check the topic and node, but there is no topic or node connected to the node "MAVLink_ros". As a beginner to ROS and Linus, I do not know how to solve the issue. My Ubuntu version is 12.10 and ROS is Hydro. Many thnaks.
