Q:

rosjava groovy install help

Hey all
Am looking to install ROS java and have been going through the external documentation here http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/installing.html
However it is for older versions of ROS that do not use catkin. Is there anything different I need to do in order to correctly install ROSJava into my catkin workspace?
Also "rosws merge http://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/.rosinstall" is giving me a 404 error and using the links from "https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core" are giving me a 406 Not acceptable error.
Any help from someone who has installed ROSJava on Groovy?
Cheers

A:

rosjava has just been catkinized in source repo, although I haven't tried it out. You may want to try it out and feedback should be appreciated.

Ok, have downloaded and have rosjava_core in "~/catkin_ws/src/rosjava_core".
Running catkin_make in "~/catkin_ws" however is giving build error "Execution failed for task ':rosjava_test:compileJava'? Can't find a solution, but appears to have been reported at least previosuly

Feedback so far: When running either "catkin_make" or "./gradlew install" rosjava is unable to find rosjava_test package. I put a report on the git stie here https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core/issues/156

Can you roscd to test_ros? Is it in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
Comment by HenryW on 2013-05-08:
will test that tomorrow, I know I can roscd in rosjava_core quite happily. The test_ros "pakcage" is stored within a subdirectory of rosjava_core. Would assume it would be able to see it, but will check tomorrow, cause you are probably right

@HenryW I know this is a year later, but did you have any success? I'm also trying to use rosjava with Groovy and am hitting the package test_ros does not exist error when I try to build.
edit: NVM, using wstool then building worked, strange..
