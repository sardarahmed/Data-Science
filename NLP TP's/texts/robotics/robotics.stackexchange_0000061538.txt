Q:

anyway to change camera publisher topic?

hi guys.
I'm currently testing out the Teleop (Hydro) app on my Nexus 10 to control Turtlebot.
Im able to establish the pairing between both parties, and able to control the turtlebot using the Virtual Joystick but unable to view live camera feed.
note that I'm using Asus Xtion Pro Live camera. It is able to display image in rviz (so i take it as it's working)
BUT, there is no topic: /camera/rgb/image_raw/compressed
These are the steps that i made:

roscore
rocon_launch turtlebot_bringup bringup.concert
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch

okay. so what i find out is.. that the app itself is subscribing to:

/camera/rgb/image_raw/compressed

but when i run:

rostopic info
/camera/rgb/image_raw/compressed

it shows:

Type: sensor_msgs/CompressedImage
Publishers:
/camera/camera_nodelet_manager
(http://192.168.1.23:50576/) / this is
actually my turtlebot ip/
Subscribers:
none

I'm wondering if i need to change there 3dsensor.launch file to manually change the publishing topic so that my nexus can subscribe to it?
if i need to do so, how may i change the launch file?

A:

You can simply remap the topic to another topic by adding this to the line where you start the node in the launch file
remap from="oldTopic" to="newTopic"
