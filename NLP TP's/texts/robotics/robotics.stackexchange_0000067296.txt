ROS Answers SE migration: PTAM Error

I got an Problem with my Current ROS. I download an current ROS Indigo 64 Bit VM from nootrix and i want to install the ptam package from ROS.
I have already done the catkin_make from ptam git repo.
But when i want to start the launcher with
roslaunch ptam cameracalibrator.launch
I got this error: [cameracalibrator.launch] is neither a launch file in package [ptam] nor is [ptam] a launch file name

A:

You need to source your workspace using the following command.
 source ~/your_catkin_workspace/devel/setup.bash

By that a new package is added to your path and thus known to the ROS environment.
