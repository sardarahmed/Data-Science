Q:

ros openni and opencv

i am making a human following robot using kinect. My plan is to use skeleton tracking to make the robot follow and using shirt color to identify the target.
I wonder how could i implement openni and opencv together?

A:

In fact, I haven't use openni with kinect. I use freenect.
Maybe you can find necessary information in this website:http://wiki.ros.org/freenect_launch
If you want to run kinect. You just need to use

roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch

Or sometimes , you might need to add authority for kinect's serial.
