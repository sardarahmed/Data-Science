Q:

ROS2 SLAM without Lidar

I am trying to implement SLAM and robot localization for my ROV - remotely operated underwater vehicle- without using lidar. nor wheel encoders since the rov's movement uses T200 thrusters and not wheel encoders- it is not a differential robot. however all implementations i have found are using Lidar primarily and wheel encoders (and IMU sensor).is what i am trying to do possible? if so, how should i change slam to work with imu and any other needed sensor that is not a lidar, using the nav2 stack and if needed the robot localization package. any references to someone who has done the same would be welcome.

A:

You will need to provide your own specialized localization solution since you don't have any of the necessary requirements for 2D or 3D lidar SLAM. There are VSLAMs you might want to check out, but I don't know the particulars of your robot or underwater robotics environments that you're in to know if those are any more viable.
You obviously need to pick the right localization technique for your environment / robot sensor modalities.
