Q:

rospack deps-msgsrv

Recently updated to Diamondback. Attempting to build my package, and rosmake/make fails during a rospack deps-msgsrv call, as (according to the usage message that pops up) there no longer is a rospack desp-msgsrv command.
Suggestions? Do I have some kind of conflict between cturtle scripts and Diamondback implementation of rospack?
Thanks

Can you paste in the exact command that you try and the error that you get?

A:

Have you run a "make clean" on the package before trying to rebuild under diamondback? If there is anything left from cturtle, that may cause a problem.

Perfect. Worked like a charm, and so simple I'm kicking myself for not thinking of it. Thanks.
