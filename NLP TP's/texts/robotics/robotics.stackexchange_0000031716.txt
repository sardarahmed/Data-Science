Q:

What topics is my nodelet listening to? (For RGBD6D playback)

Hello folks,
Background:
I'm playing around with openni_camera_unstable, hoping to get a two-pass pointcloud-generation system going (in the first pass, I record the image and depth data; in the second, I generate the registered pointclouds; limited hardware on my robot makes this handy).
Question:
If I fire up unstable's openni.launch, I get nice pointclouds exactly like I would expect. What I'd like to do is figure out what topics I need to bag in order to be able to run the point-cloud projection nodelet in a second pass. rosnode list shows /camera/points_xyzrgb_depth_rgb, which is the nodelet doing this work, but rosnode info on that node just lists a bunch of bond topics. The node actually publishing the point clouds is the manager (which I suppose makes sense, as I understand that to be the actual owning process of the various nodelets).
So: how do I figure out which topics my nodelet is subscribing to? (Alternatively, which topics do I need to accomplish what I'm after?)
Thanks!

A:

To answer your specific use case: you need to bag /camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw, /camera/rgb/image_rect_color, and /camera/rgb/camera_info.
As for the more general question, I have the same frustration. We need nodelet equivalents of rosnode info and rxgraph, but that tooling doesn't exist yet.

If you have the bag file playing, run this to get the point cloud: ROS_NAMESPACE=camera rosrun nodelet nodelet standalone openni_camera/point_cloud_xyzrgb

At the bottom of http://www.ros.org/wiki/common (stack containing the nodelet package) there's a "request features" link to create a ticket in the right Trac.

Thanks for posting; I had, in fact, figured that out by source-code perusal, but failed to post the results. What's the right way to request said features? File a bug? Organize a mob, with signs and patriotic music?
