Q:

Is an avatar or talking head available in ROS?

Hi,
I am searching for an avatar like visualization in ROS.
So I have voice output and a face with speech animation that I can present on a tablet.
Right now, I only found gazebo and festival which could be usable.
Gazebo seems to me like a 3D editor similar to bender where I can load models through ROS and animate them. But I would just need something like a player that animates the face when there is voice output.
Has anyone a tip for me?
