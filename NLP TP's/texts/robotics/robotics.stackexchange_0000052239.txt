Q:

How to troubleshoot network delay

My robot sends kinect XYZ and RGB data to PC through wifi.
The amount of data for each frame is about 700KB, but I can only send 3 frames every second. If I send more frame , the network will be delay heavily.
Is this normal?

A:

Assuming wlan standard 802.11b, the maximal bandwith is 11 MBit/s = 1,375 MByte/s. If one kinect frame amounts to 700kBytes, 2 fps would be the upper max. Using wlan standard 802.11g, 22 MBit/s = 2,75 MByte/s = 4fps would be realistic. So I would say that your 3 fps seem to be normal, yes.
depending on your scenario, you could try to separate data acquisition and processing: send only the raw data (rgb, depth map) over the network and assemble the full XYZRGB point cloud at the receivers end.
