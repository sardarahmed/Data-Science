Q:

teb_local_planner test_optim_node crashing

Hi all,
I was interested in analyzing the behavior of the teb_local_planner for move_base and therefore I started following the tutorials. I'm working with kinetic on 16.04.
To test it, I need to run:
~$ roslaunch teb_local_planner test_optim_node.launch

However when I enable the "optimization of multiple trajectories in distinctive topologies" with
~$ rosparam set /test_optim_node/enable_homotopy_class_planning True 

I get strange behaviors.
Basically, after a while that I start moving the interactive markers the node crashes with this error:
[rviz-3] process has died [pid 1882, exit code -11, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/rviz/rviz -d /opt/ros/kinetic/share/teb_local_planner/cfg/rviz_test_optim.rviz __name:=rviz __log:=/home/federiconardi/.ros/log/121ecffc-a234-11e9-8c71-e0d55e0d1e46/rviz-3.log].

I don't really know what is causing the problem. Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Hi,
this issue is not directly related to the teb_local_planner but to rviz in combination with nvidia graphics cards.
See here.
However, some potential workarounds exist (see link before), but I have not implemented/tested them yet.
