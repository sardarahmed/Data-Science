Q:

Which user input devices can be used beside Razer Hydra?

I can see from the tutorials section that the Razer Hydra can be used with Gazebo, but what about others such as playstation, xbox or other console-agnostic controllers?

A:

Not exactly a "controller", but you can use a SpaceNav 3d mouse without much extra setup.
One common way to use joysticks is through ROS. It would be nice to have more out-of-the-box plugins to use joysticks directly with Gazebo...
Fun fact, I recently discovered that those "presentation laser pointer remotes" register just like keyboard keystrokes, and they can be used with the KeyboardGUIPlugin.
