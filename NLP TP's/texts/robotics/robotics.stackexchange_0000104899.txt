Q:

No costmap received Nav2

I am trying to have my robot navigate with Nav2, I have a laptop connected to the same network as the robot in order to visualize and send navigation goals, however I am getting a "No map received" warning in RViz2 as shown below:

I tried running the navigation nodes on the remote PC and the map shows successfully but I want to have the navigation run on the robot computer. I also tried running the SLAM on the robot and visualize on the remote PC and the map is showing as shown bellow, so I don't know what should I do to visualize the map when doing navigation.

[EDIT]
The problem with the map was that I had to configure the Durability policy to Transient local, however the costmap is still not showing, I compared the rqt_graph output on both cases (launching the navigation nodes from the robot computer and on my personal computer) and I see the bt_navigator node is not publishing /bond topic so I went to check the logs when launching navigation on the robot computer and I see there is a problem on the bt_navigator node when it is configuring, the error is the following:

A:

The problem with the map was that I had the Durability policy in RViz as Volatile instead of Transcient local. And the problem with the costmap was that I didn't installed behaviourtree_cpp_v3 package on my robot computer.
