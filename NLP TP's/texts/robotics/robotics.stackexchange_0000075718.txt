Q:

How do I measure packet latency?

What I want to know is how do I measure latency? Are there ROS functions that support this? More specifically, would this practice be applicable to windows?

A:

ROS doesn't have any convenience functions for measuring latency, but it's relatively simple to get a decent latency measurement by comparing the timestamp in the header with the current time.
The accuracy of this measurement will depend on:

latency between the header timestamp and actual message transmission
the actual network latency
queuing latency on the receiving computer
any clock offset between the sending and receiving computer
maybe a few other factors

If you're trying to measure packet latency there's really no substitute for understanding how much latency and jitter your system can tolerate, and doing your research.
