Hello,

when i have tried to run the tutorial  hector_slam
Every thing seems ok..but when i have tried to save the map two files have been created: test.pgm and test.yaml,but the image in test.pgm is blank how can i fix this error ?
This what i have done exactly
roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch

then
rosbag play Team_Hector_MappingBox_RoboCup_2011_Rescue_Arena.bag  --clock

there is shot of rviz & terminal

Thanks in advance

What we can't see in the screenshot: Is there a map that looks OK? Also is blank = empty or blank= all grey?

The normal screen of rviz  and the image that has been saved from map is blank

Please add rxgraph or similar output to check if the topics are connected.

A:

After you start playing bag file add "param name="use_sim_time" value="true"/" in ur launch file. This will take clock from ur rosbag file.
