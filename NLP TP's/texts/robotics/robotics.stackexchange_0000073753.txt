Q:

Quaternion problem?

Hello,
I have a problem with this function: geometry_msgs::Quaternion odom_quat= tf::createQuaternionMsgFromYaw(th);
when I give the input value "th" in degree it functions and the robot turns but with bad precision.
And when I give the input in radians it doesn't function at all !!!
I don't know where's the problem !
Any suggestion please !
Regards.

You could edit this question to provide a bit more context, otherwise, I'm guessing people will not be able to help you.

A:

This function definitely takes its input in radians. I just tested it with a few different yaw angles and the geometry_msgs::Quaternion created produced the expected values. I'm guessing the issue lies with your robot, its interfaces, or its controllers.
