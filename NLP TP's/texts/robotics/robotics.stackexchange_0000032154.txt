Q:

Failed Installation attempt of TurtleSim

So, I've tried to install TurtleSim several times now, but to no avail.
I am basically taking over for the main guy that ran this OS, but I'm at a loss of experience with ROS.
Now, to the situation.
I have tried several install attempts according to the tutorials that are on the website, but TurtleSim will not work. When I check for installation, it says that TurtleSim is installed, but when I try to run I get the following script:
rmp@rfm5237-003:~$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node [rospack] couldn't find package [turtlesim]
I've searched through the FAQs and several online sections that deal with TurtleSim, but I'm still at a loss. If anyone could give me an answer or point me to where to look, that would be appreciated.
Thanks for the help.

I there was an error in the tutorials, I think you need to install ros-diamondback-desktop. Sorry that you had a problem getting things working.
