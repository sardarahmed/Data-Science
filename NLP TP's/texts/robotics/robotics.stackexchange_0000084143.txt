Q:

Failed to create the global_planner/GlobalPlanner planner

Setup: ROS Kinetic, Ubuntu 16.04
on the TurtleBot platform, when launching the move_base node configured for the global_planner/GlobalPlanner, I receive the following error:
Failed to create the global_planner/GlobalPlanner planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class global_planner/GlobalPlanner with base class type nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner does not exist. Declared types are navfn/NavfnROS
I load move_base_params.yaml within move_base as follows:
<node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen" >
<rosparam file="$(find robust_navigation)/param/move_base_params.yaml" command="load" />
where the base_global_planner param is defined in move_base_params.yaml as follows:
base_global_planner: "global_planner/GlobalPlanner"
I've re-installed the nav stack and re-built my workspace to no avail.

Hello, Could you explain how did you resolve this issue? I am also facing the same error. I have created my own local planner. Thank you.

Most likely, you are miising the global_planner package. Use to following command to install it, e.g. for melodic:
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-global_planner
