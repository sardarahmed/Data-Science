Q:

Measure processor loading in Webots

Is there a way to measure the CPU usage or the processor loading per simulation time step? I essentially want a way to compare the computational cost of different controller implementations
I reckon I can get an indication of CPU usage on my Mac's Activity Monitor, but was wondering if there's a better and more quantitative way
For context, I am simulating different kinds of controllers for a swarm robot system consisting of ~40 e-puck robots

A:

You can use the --log-performance command line option of Webots. According to the Webots user guide:
  --log-performance=<file>[,<steps>]
    Measure the performance of Webots and log it in the file specified in the
    <file> argument. The optional <steps> argument is an integer value that
    specifies how many steps are logged. If the --sysinfo option is used, the
    system information is prepended into the log file.

If that is not sufficient, I would recommend you to recompile Webots from the source and add your own timers inside the code of Webots.
