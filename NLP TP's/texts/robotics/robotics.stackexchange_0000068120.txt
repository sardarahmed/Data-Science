Q:

Stack/package robot_setup_tf not found

Hi all. I'm new to ROS. I'm tasked to Hokuyo UST-20LX's laser scan to scan area.
I'm stuck with the robot_setup_tf part. I have already set up my workspace environment with:
~/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash

and to confirm:
~/catkin_ws$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

I get:
/home/gordon/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

Afterwards I did catkin_make and catkin_make install (no error) and tried to run:
rosrun robot_setup_tf tf_broadcaster

It gives me:
[rospack] Error: stack/package robot_setup_tf not found

I suspect the problems lies with the environment configuration (just my guess) and ran:
~/catkin_ws$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

and I got:
/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

Any problems with the environment setup? If not, what is the problems with not being able to start up tf_broadcaster?
Thanks!

Catkin does out-of-source builds, which is why you need to source other spaces like devel. Since you ran catkin_make install, all build artefacts will be installed into the install space. That space has its own setup.bash, so you'll need to source that, but only after you've ran catkin_make install.
I don't see a source ~/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash in your OP, so I'm guessing you didn't do that.
See wiki/catkin/workspaces for more info on catkin workspaces in general, and on catkin spaces in particular. REP-128 is the more normative reference for this.
PS: running catkin_make install isn't actually necessary to execute nodes in your workspace. A regular catkin_make results in a devel space that can already be used. Just source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash after building your workspace. No need to install anything.
PPS: this is completely up to you of course, but I'd not use Groovy anymore. It EOL-ed for some time now, so no updated and / or fixes will be released for it.

Oh I get it. I sourced back devel/setup.bash and run rosrun robot_setup_tf tf_broadcaster , it works. Thanks a lot!
