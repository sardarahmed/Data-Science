Q:

Bluetooth integration with MSP430

I am trying to integrate bluetooth in a project with MSP430 so to be able to communicate between it and my PC. Doing a search on eBay I found the following item:
HC-05 06 Transceiver Bluetooth Module Backboard Interface Base Board Serial

There are also a lot of other bluetooth modules that appear to be a lot more expensive and their boards are populated with IC's that this one doesn't have. So I am wondering if this is what I need or it has another use.

A:

This module has a simple serial interface that can be hooked directly to the MCU's UART pins, and provide seamless wireless serial communication with a paired device or computer with virtual Bluetooth serial port. If this is the intention, it would be the right choice.
