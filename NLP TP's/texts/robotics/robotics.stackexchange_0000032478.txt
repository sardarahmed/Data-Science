Q:

getting data from a pointcloud2 coming from Kinect

I am working on getting depth data from Kinect. as i understand, the point cloud topic from Kinect (/camera/depth/points2) directly provides depth data in meters in the form of a pointcloud2 (please correct me if I am wrong!)
however, after browsing through pointcloud2 documentation, I did not find any method to, say, access the value of a specific point in the point cloud. then I read somewhere that pointcloud2 is abstracted in such a way that data cannot be accessed directly from it. (is that true?)
could anyone help me out with getting data from the pointcloud2 topic that I am subscribing to?
thanks!

Try to search through the history of questions. This answer was already asked a few times.

A:

You probably will want to use the Point Cloud Library (http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl) to access and manipulate cloud data. There are several tutorials available.
