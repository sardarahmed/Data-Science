Q:

Where is C++ node implementation code?

Hi, I want to initialize a C# node.
And I want to consult the implementation of C++ node, I found several files in /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/src/libros may be useful.But I am not sure if these files are the right ones I am looking for.
Thanks~

A:

You're really talking about Implementing a Client Library for C#. That page has a number of links to various documentation on the design of client libraries.
