Q:

Gazebo2 with black screen

Hello all,
I  just install gazebo2 on 14.04 Ubuntu. Everytime I run gazebo. It shows nothing but black screen or broken pics. Does the problem have something to do with the graphic card? I use Intel Broadwell integrated graphic.

Thanks in advance

Please, run by terminal with the command gazebo --verbose and feedback with the output.

Hello,
I had the same problem as you! My configurations are:
lsb_release -a

Distributor ID:   Ubuntu
Description:  Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS
Release:  14.04 Codename: trusty

lspci -k | egrep 'VGA|3D' -A2

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller:
Intel Corporation Broadwell-U
Integrated Graphics (rev 09)
Subsystem: Dell Device 0643     Kernel
driver in use: i915

After some research, I found this link which suggest to upgrade the kernel and graphical stack with the command:
sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libqt5gui5 libgles1-mesa-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic:i386 libglapi-mesa-lts-utopic:i386 libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic

Gazebo started to "work" again, as you can see:

I hope this answer can be helpfull.
Best regards
