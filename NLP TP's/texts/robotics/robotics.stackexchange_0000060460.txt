Q:

uwsim_binary: error while loading shared libraries: libosgbCollision.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This is a solved question. I want to make it public.
After updating a lot of hydro packages, when I run:
$ rosrun uwsim uwsim --disableShaders

I obtained this:
Starting UWSim...
/home/foo/catkin_ws/install/lib/uwsim/uwsim_binary: error while loading shared libraries: libosgbCollision.so.2.00.02: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

As someone wiser than me told me, a few months ago UWSim dependencies were updated for using bullet 2.82 (from there the osgbullet error) and unfortunately the change is not compatible with what had preceded.
I needed to upgrade my simulator version for using this bullet version.

A:

Solution: Simply making a git pull inside catkin_ws/src/underwater_simulation directory should be sufficient (Of course, followed by a catkin_make install inside catkin_ws directory to compile).
As I didn't modify anything inside that directory I had no problem. If I had done so, it would be possible to have conflict trying to join the new files with the modified ones.
