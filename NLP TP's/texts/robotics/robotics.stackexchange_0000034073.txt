Q:

OpenCV in Electric

Recompiling under Electric I'm getting the following OpenCV error:
Failed to find rosdep opencv2.3 for package...

It seems the the OpenCV2 package is deprecated.  What do I need to do to move to the new regime?
When using rosdep install opencv2, the following errors occur:
Invalid identifier found [lucid] when processing rosdep boost.

When using rosdep install cv_bridge the following occurs:

OS is Linux Mint 11
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-09-03:
Could you include your OS, CMakeLists and manifest?

A:

It has been replaced with a rosdep dependency on the system version.
Follow-up information suggests that rosdep is having trouble identifying your Mint 11 version of Linux. It seems to think you are running Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty). Presumably, this question is related somehow.

It's not the same as the debian.py issue, which is fixed in Electric, but it's probably something similar.
Comment by JediHamster on 2011-09-04:
Yes I think you're right.  Mint 11 is really just Ubuntu 11.04 without Unity and with a different menu system.  It looks as if I can compile without using --rosdep-install, so this is really an issue with detecting the relevant dependent packages.
Comment by JediHamster on 2011-09-03:
See above.
Comment by joq on 2011-09-03:
What happens if you type: rosdep install cv_bridge?
Comment by JediHamster on 2011-09-03:
I added the following to CMakeLists.txt: find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${OpenCV_LIBS})
Comment by joq on 2011-09-03:
Did you do the CMakeLists.txt changes?
Comment by JediHamster on 2011-09-03:
Even including those depends I still get the same failure.  Should I have a stack.xml file?
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-09-03:
The page @joq linked to contains a sample manifest.xml fragment: http://www.ros.org/wiki/opencv2#Package.2BAC8-stack_dependencies
Comment by JediHamster on 2011-09-03:
So what should I be declaring within manifest.xml ?
