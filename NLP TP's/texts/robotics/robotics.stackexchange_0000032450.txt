Q:

How to construct the point cloud data from the depth data

I have already acheived the depth data from the Kinect using the openkinect driver. I have already got the data for the x, y and z of the point cloud.Now, I need to plot point cloud data and would like to visualize it in rviz.How do i go about doing it?
Any help would be appreciated..

A:

Publish a sensor_msgs::PointCloud2. The easiest way would be to create a PointCloud object from the pcl and publish that directly. Section 3.1 in pcl_ros has a code example.
It is even easier to run the openni_camera node that does that for you.

u mean the sensor_msgs::PointCloud2?
Comment by dornhege on 2011-06-23:
just use the PointCloud class from the pcl as I said. It is very easy to fill the data in there and publish it.

i have already done that... but i would like to use the openkinect(libfreenect) driver and run the pointcloud from that...
