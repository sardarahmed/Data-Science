Q:

unable to use openni2_launch

Hi guys,
This is my first post on this forum!
I have been searching everywhere on the web and especially on this forum without finding any answer. Please forgive me if the answer was there and that I missed it!
I am trying to display an image from my xtion live connected on my beagle bone black to a rviz instance running on a virtual machine.
I am running ROS indigo on ubuntu 14.04 on both the virtual machine and the bbb. I followed the ros installation tutorials for ubuntu and ubuntu ARM.

roscore is running on the virtual machine
rviz is running on the virtual machine as well
I set the ROS_MASTER_URI variable to the IP of the virtual machine on my bbb

When I run "roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch" on the bbb I get the following log :
Device "1d27/0601@1/3" with serial number "1208250036" connected
camera/driver-2 process has finished cleanly
The log file states :
Bond broken, exiting
I am able to open a depth stream using mjpeg_server and using "rosrun openni2_camera openni2_camera_node" but even though the IR sensor lights up I get no image either in rviz or on mjpeg_server
Can anyone help me ?
Full output of "roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch --screen" can be found here : http://pastebin.com/Q38VpuVq
Thanks
Regards,
Pouc

It looks like the openni2 driver is crashing. Can you edit your question to include the full output from roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch --screen please?

Hi ahendrix. Thanks for your answer. I have added the requested command output in the question as a pastebin link.

I haven't seen anything like that before. It looks like some part of the nodelet infrastructure is crashing, but I'm not really sure how to go about troubleshooting it.

A:

I found the answer to this question.
It was a communication problem between the openni2_camera node and the roscore node that is on a different machine
My bbb changed it's IP address because of a DHCP lease expiration
After updating the address in the hosts file this error is not occuring again.
Thanks ahendrix for helping me and I hope this thread will help others
