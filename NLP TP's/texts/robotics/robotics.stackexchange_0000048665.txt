Q:

Opencv2 include problems

Hello,
I am using fuerte an Ubuntu 12.04 and have an
include <opencv2/core/core.hpp> which can't be resolved (fatal error: opencv2/core/core.hpp: No such file or directory ).
Iin the manifest I have <depend package="opencv2"/> and the file is at /opt/ros/fuerte/include/opencv2/core.
Running rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags opencv2 shows following output
[rospack] Warning: ignoring duplicate cpp tag in export block
-I/opt/ros/fuerte/include/opencv -I/opt/ros/fuerte/include

Any idea why it doesn't finde the file?

A:

I got it working with this:
 if(NOT OpenCV_DIR)
 find_path(OpenCV_DIR "OpenCVConfig.cmake" DOC "Root directory of OpenCV" HINTS    "/opt/ros/fuerte/share/OpenCV/")
endif(NOT OpenCV_DIR)
FIND_PACKAGE(OpenCV REQUIRED)
