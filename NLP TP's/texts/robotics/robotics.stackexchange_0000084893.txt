Q:

Compilation of catkin work space fails on beaglebone black

Hello all
I am running debian 8.7 on the beaglebone black and i am following these instructions to help me get ROS installed and running.
Everything is working fine until the final step where the catkin workspace is created. It fails with the following errors:
c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.9/README.Bugs> for instructions.
ros_comm/roscpp/CMakeFiles/roscpp.dir/build.make:110: recipe for target 'ros_comm/roscpp/CMakeFiles/roscpp.dir/src/libros/subscriber.cpp.o' failed
make[2]: *** [ros_comm/roscpp/CMakeFiles/roscpp.dir/src/libros/subscriber.cpp.o] Error 4
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:8823: recipe for target 'ros_comm/roscpp/CMakeFiles/roscpp.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [ros_comm/roscpp/CMakeFiles/roscpp.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:138: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make -j1 -l1" failed 

Can anyone help me out in resolving this error ?
Many thanks in advance.
If anyone has a better suggestion in getting ROS installed on the BBB, please do share with me, I have tried many threads and posts but all are outdated and i am unable to get OS images for the specified methods.

These sort of errors typicaly come up when your system has run out of memory.
Do you have swap enabled?

thank you for your reply
no i do not have swap enabled on the BBB. I will try doing that and report my results.

I would recommend a topic change btw: compilation of your workspace fails. Creating the workspace itself (which is essentially just a directory) does not.

A:

Hello friend, I regret to say that I have little experience installing ROS in different embedded systems that are not officially supported. But I have been fighting for a long time with the problems that arise in Raspberry PI and I do not recognize any of them in the error that you present.
I know it does not solve your problem but I could recommend you change the platform, for an embedded system with more documentation like a Raspberry PI or an embedded computer. You can even find a memory with Ubuntu and ROS preinstalled.
I hope I could have helped you even if it was a little

Thank you for taking the time to reply to my question. Unfortunately I need the BBB because of its ability to handle analog signals as compared to  the Rasberry pi.
I will also try Ubuntu on it as you suggested.
