Q:

ar track alvar - kinect

Dear Ros Users,
I'm trying to use the ar track alvare package combined with data from kinect. However, I don't understand how I can use the depth camera data, as exposed in the description of the package:
"Identifying and tracking the pose of individual AR tags, optionally integrating kinect depth data (when a kinect is available) for better pose estimates."
