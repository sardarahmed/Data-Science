Q:

Creating interactive image display(in rviz?)

Hi,
I am a total ROS/gazebo noob. I recently installed groovy on ubuntu 12.10 and I am running the TUM's gazebo simulator for a quadrotor.
My question -
There is an image topic being published by the simulator(which is the 2D image of the world that the quadrotor sees using its camera). I can view this image in rviz or using image_view package.
How do I create a gui window where I can display this image and when I click at a location in the image, I get the mouse click event(location of the click within the image window)?
I would appreciate if the solution is a bit more detailed or guiding as I am a total noob to ROS itself.(the solution need not be related to rviz)

A:

Finally got something working using this link below.
http://ros.org/rosdoclite/groovy/api/rviz_python_tutorial/html/
To create an image panel, all I needed to do was write a config file(which included a image display panel and the topic to subscribe from) and then load that config file.
Instead of manually creating the config file, I open rviz and then created a Display Panel in that and then added image to the Display and then set the topic in the properties for the image. Then, I saved these configs in from the File menu and am currently using it.
