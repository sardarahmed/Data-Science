Q:

Configuring laser_filters parameters

I want to use the LaserScanRangeFilter plugin of the laser_filters package, but I need to configure its parameters dynamically as I have to send the upper and lower thresholds from a remote device. My question is, how can I modify those parameters automatically? Is it possible to modify the .YAML file used to set the plugin up through C++ or Python nodes? Or do I have to write every parameter in the .launch file manually (and if so how could I write the tags corresponding to the actual plugin parameters)?

How often do you need to change them? What is your remote device / how are you communicating your upper / lower bounds?

Device is a samsung tablet with android communicating with ROS through rosbridge. I only need to change parameters each time I start the main program of the robot

A:

I think #q10266 is what you're looking for.
Read the documentation of dynamic_reconfigure for more details.

dynamic_reconfigure won't let me configure the laser_filter node...

Can you be more explicit ?
If you run rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam list you don't have your node ?
Comment by JKaiser on 2018-05-07:
No, It doesn't appear. Only the base Laser node appears, and the parameters that can be configured don't help me at all. The Laser_Filters node isn't listed at all. In the end I had to change the way my system interacted with the LaserScan data.
