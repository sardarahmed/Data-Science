Q:

freenect_launch will always stop and flush when I launch rgbdslam

I am using ROS hydro on ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The problem is, since I'm using freenect to get depth and RGB images for rgbdslam, the freenect node will be okay if I leave it alone without any subscriber. But soon after I started processing the image in the rgbdslam node, the freenect node will stop and fall to a dead loop of:
[ INFO] [1419407643.570524704]: Device timed out. Flushing device.
[ INFO] [1419407643.570749230]: Starting a 3s RGB and Depth stream flush.
...

I'm using Kinect 1, and ubuntu is running in Parallels Desktop 10 with Mac OS X.
I don't know what has caused this problem, anyone can help me? Thanks in advance.

I have the same problem.
Did you find a solution or a workaround for that?

Same issue here: MacBook Pro -  virtual machine VMWare, Ubuntu 14.04, ROS indigo - what worked for me ("root cause"): USB settings: changed it to "USB 3.0" compatible and it worked! negative side effect: USB connection to Turtlebot2 broken (kobuki)...fix: connecting the kobuki via ab USB 2.0 hub

A:

For those who's interested: solved by switching to openni with drivers installed from https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
