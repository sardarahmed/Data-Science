Q:

Publishing image data using bunch of images in directory

Hi.
I'm thinking to make 'dataset player' which is playing individual frame file to image topic.
For example, the dataset from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/karlsruhe_sequences.html, to virtual camera to test various algorithm.
However, I think it would be tedious job...
Before I'm doing so, please let me know any related package with this.
It would be nice!
