Q:

lz4 includes not found

When building on Mac Sierra, I got an error, and then used this command to reproduce. By the way, excellent logging and tools for trying to narrow down the problem! Anyway, here's the command:
cd /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/roslz4 && /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh cmake /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/src/ros_comm/roslz4 -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/roslz4 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G 'Unix Makefiles'

This command gives the following error in trying to build roslz4 and I can't find any info on where to look to fix it.

A:

This is part of the many problems in getting ROS up on Mac. You can read my summary of this experience in another question. Bottom line, I abandoned trying to install it on Mac, there are just too many loose ends. I am having far better success with running ROS under VMWare with Ubuntu.
