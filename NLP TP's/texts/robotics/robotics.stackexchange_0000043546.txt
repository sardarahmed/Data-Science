Q:

cvblob and cvBlobsLib

Is it possible to use cvblob or cvBlobsLib with ROS?
If yes, how can I do it?

Well, I was able to find the blobs using this code: http://nghiaho.com/?p=1102. But then I need to track them and I'm having a hard time trying to make ir. I can find their centroids, but I loose track of which is which during program execution.

@pgorczak, does this SimpleBlobDetector have tracking capabilities? As far as I could understand reading the link you provided, it does not, but maybe you have seen something in this regard.

That's why I was trying to use cvBlob, as it has "Basic blob tracking" out of the box.

The beauty of the new OpenCV is, that you can plug in any matcher behind the blob detector. A simple k-nearest-neighbors (knn) matcher could be enough. cvBlob probably does something like that in the background.

A:

If you want to run blob detection with OpenCV, I would recommend taking a look at [SimpleBlobDetector](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/features2d/doc/common_interfaces_of_feature_detectors.html#SimpleBlobDetector : public FeatureDetector). You can easily convert any ROS image message to an OpenCV-Mat using cv_bridge and take it from there.
If the above mentioned detector suits your needs, I'll give you more details on how to make it work.

Can you please give the more details about that. I have converted the ros image into opencv-mat using cv_bridge. What shall i do next i.e. how i can configure or install cvblobs with ROS and what depencies shall i add in package.xml and also the in cmakelist !  I am using ROS-Hydro
