Q:

How do you make calibration boards?

The recommended(8x6) calibration board is so big they won't print on a normal printer. How do you make yours? I'm using a white illustration board then pasting cut-outs of black art papers. In the long run they tend to be curved and my cuts are not that precise which is not ideal in calibration. I'm looking for a better way to have a longer lasting calibration board.

A:

A quick solution: Buy a large poster board sheet (something like this). Then print your checkerboard on A4 (or letter) sized paper. It will get cut across several (usually 4) sheets. The squares along the edges will get cut in the middle, and you can use that to align the 4 pieces properly. Glue the sheets to the cardboard, making sure the edges are aligned.
A better solution: use an aluminum dibond plate and get it custom printed. The details are discussed in this thread.
