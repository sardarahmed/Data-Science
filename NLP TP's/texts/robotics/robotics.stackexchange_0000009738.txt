Q:

How can a quadcopter be made to hover perfectly still?

I need to get my drone flying still enough that I can rest a glass of water on it.
I've tried a few KK boards and APM 2.6 (3.1 software). I've balanced props, set PID settings, auto-trim / autotune and the drone still tends to inconsistently drift a little one way or another.
What is a plausible way to completely isolate drift?

A:

Using existing resources:
Very similar answer to @SteveO - I'd focus on tuning the PID control loop for each motor individually, if possible, to eliminate any instability in the power delivery which would result in the aircraft leaning and therefore drifting.
A great video tutorial on PID control that helped me through a control exam
Using additional resources:
The most stable implementation of drift elimination I've ever seen used an optical flow sensor on the base of the aircraft - much like the old-school optical mouse sensors this looks for an offset of pixels in a certain direction through a small camera. The resultant vector of this movement then becomes your drift value, which is corrected by adjusting the power output in the opposite direction. This is what the Parrot Quadcopters in my lab use and their stability is fantastic.
