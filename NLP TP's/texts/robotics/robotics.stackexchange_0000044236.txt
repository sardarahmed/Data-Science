Sorry maybe I misunderstood the question, do you already have some code that can talk to the device? In that case wrapping it into the ROS node is really trivia and we would be happy to help. D.

A:

Hi there, I am one of the admins of the bosch-ros-pkg. Our personal robotics group at Bosch Research unfortunately does not have a ROS driver for LRR3 yet. If there is a greater demand for it, maybe we could try and get from our business unit. Can you send me a private message regarding this?
