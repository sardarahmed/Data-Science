Q:

openni_kinect driver on Windows

I'm trying to run multiple Kinects on a Windows machine. I heard that the ROS openni_kinect driver can be used to do this and from the ROS kinect wiki, it seems that Windows is supported.
But it does not mention any installation instructions for Windows. Any suggestions?

A:

If all you need is multiple kinects, you should use the raw (non-ROS) openni driver, found here: http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/opennimodules with documentation here: http://www.openni.org/documentation .
This driver should work on Windows. Getting ROS up and running on Windows is a whole different beast, and if all you need is the kinect, not the right solution.
Keep in mind that a kinect will saturate an entire USB bus: so if you want a computer to have multiple kinects, make sure they are on different physical USB buses.
