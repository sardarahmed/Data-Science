Q:

Trying to understand gmapping and playback some bag

Hi all,
I have a bag with scanner data. I am not trying to build a map.
THe scanner is in /scan.
So I ran
rosparam set use_sim_time true
roscore
rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan 
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link laser 100
Nothing seems to be published in /map.
In rviz, I see for map... transform:No transform from [] to [laser]
What am I missing?
From the doc, I can see base_link â†’ odom is needed.. How?
Why is that needed? Is not the purpose of slam to determine just that? (the base_link relative to odom)?

A:

In order to use gmapping, you have to generate an odometry estimate by integrating your encoder and/or inertial measurements, and publish the estimate as a TF transform from base_link --> odom.  See my answer on another question for more details about how particle filter SLAM algorithms like gmapping work:
