Q:

Building an executable with OpenGL

I have a C++ program which requires glut and OpenGL to run.
If I was compiling without ROS, I would add the compiler flags -lGL and -lGLU. However when using rosmake and CMakeLists I obviously can't.
How can I make rosmake link to external system libraries?

A:

If you're writing a library which will be used from another package in your manifest.xml you should export required flags, e.g.
<export>
<cpp lflags="-lGL -lglut" />
</export>
For the a binary in your CMakeLists.txt you could add
target_link_libraries(yourprogram GL glut)
or
link_libraries(GL glut)
