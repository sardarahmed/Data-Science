Q:

Installing ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "Trusty" â€“ apt-get unable to locate "ros-indigo-desktop-full"

NOTE: I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
I followed the instructions on the wiki page pertaining to the installation of Indigo until part 1.4, but when I type in sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full, I get this:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full

The same thing happens with the other default packages, and the results apt-cache search ros-indigo do not contain any of them, either. I ran sudo apt-get update, set up my keys, ran the software updater, restarted and everything, but the problem hasn't been resolved. What am I supposed to do?

The reason is that it is probably not released, yet.

Then why do they have installation instructions on the wiki? Also, "apt-cache search ros-indigo" returns a large amount of packages related to the release, just none of the defaults.

I guess once it's released, the desktop-full packages will be there. If you want an actual answer as to why that is, wait for someone official. The Indigo website says: "This ROS distribution is under development and not yet released. Please use the latest officially released distribution: Hydro."

A:

Indigo for Trusty is not yet released, not all package binaries are there yet.

You can compile ros_comm for now from source and install all ros-indigo-* packages from apt-get, this gives sufficient ROS functionality for me at least.

Is Indigo for Trusty released yet? I still can't get this to work.
