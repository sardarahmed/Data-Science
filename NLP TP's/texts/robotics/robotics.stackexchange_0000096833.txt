Q:

Cannot figure out what's going on with python3-rosdep2

I'm following the instructions for installing ROS2 here and I keep getting the error
sudo: rosdep: command not found

when I run sudo update init. Looking through the files installed in the package python3-rosdep2, I don't see any executable. I tried sudo python3 -m rosdep2 init and it says
/usr/bin/python3: No module named rosdep2.__main__; 'rosdep2' is a package and cannot be directly executed

So I have no idea what to do next. I created an issue on github and was told to ask my question here. After following the instructions given on github I still cannot execute the steps to install and use python3-rosdep2.

A:

The comment on github has the answer. Uninstall python3-rosdep2, and install python3-rosdep or python-rosdep. python3-rosdep2 is an older version. See this question for more info.
