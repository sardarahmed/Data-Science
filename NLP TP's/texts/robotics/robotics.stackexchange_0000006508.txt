Q:

Low power computer for stereo vision

I would like to build a motorized robot with stereo vision that sends visual input to a PC over wifi for processing. A Raspberry Pi would have been perfect for the task if it would be possible to connect 2 cameras. The Pi 2 would be powerful enough for two USB webcams (with minimum 8fps) I guess, but the shared USB seems to be a bottleneck (2 cameras + wifi dongle).
What other options are there to send input from 2 cameras and control a motor (or an arduino)?

A:

You probably are asking too much of inexpensive components.
The raspberry Pi does not have 2 camera connections, but its brother, the Pi Compute board does.

Even then, you will have to write optimized GPU Code in assembler to get anything near acceptable performance if you try to do it all on the Pi.
I doubt there will be any cpu cycles left to do anything else.
For now I believe the best inexpensive solution remains the Kinect. I've seen some recent new products described, but no news of how they work for robotics (Intel RealSense, Creative Senz3D). 
Wait for something new or spend more money or use the Kinect.
