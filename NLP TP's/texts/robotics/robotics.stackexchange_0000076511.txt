Q:

buildfarm Krel_import-package checksum error

Hi,
I got a lot of emails from the buildfarm concerning sourcedebs checksum errors:
File "pool/main/r/ros-kinetic-rtabmap/ros-kinetic-rtabmap_0.11.8.orig.tar.gz" is already registered with different checksums!
md5 expected: 43c514654a21568f838c575b3c0baba7, got: 64c9eb84ed9ba85b8cfe31f4eb4296c3

There have been errors!

Example of the failing job's message:
Waiting for the completion of Krel_import-package
Krel_import-package #52328 completed. Result was FAILURE

Builds affected are:

Maybe related to:

https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm/issues/119
https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm/issues/233
https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm/issues/21

Is this could be fixed just by redoing a bloom-release?
cheers,
Mathieu

Just noticed (https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/bloom/issues/406) that my python-bloom version (0.5.20) was not the latest one (0.5.22). I just released again a new version, hope this will fix the problem.

A:

I don't think it's the version of bloom that was the problem but that you retagged content before that release: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/12841#issuecomment-249987345
Changing tagged content violates assumptions that the build pipeline makes about data consistency. Version tagged content is not expected to change.
The rerelease probably cleared the cached content at some level.
