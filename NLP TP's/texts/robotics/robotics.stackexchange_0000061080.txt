Q:

process[rosout-1] keeps repeating

Followed the tutorial up till turtlebot bringup. (apparently i dont have enough karma to post links)
Managed to SSH into the turtle bot laptop, then I tried the turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch and these came out on the terminal non stop
process[rosout-1]: started with pid [7331]
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid

Help?
Workstation is running ROS Indigo while the turtlebot laptop is running ROS hydro.
Will different version of ROS complicate things? Or did I messed up somewhere during the installation?

A:

It looks like you don't have your locale set properly.
You may want to take a look at the Ubuntu page about generating locale files: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Locale
Or just try setting your locale to the generic C locale (named for the C programming language):
sudo update-locale LANG=C LANGUAGE=C LC_ALL=C LC_MESSAGES=POSIX

export LC_ALL="C" seems to do the trick for me.
thank you!
