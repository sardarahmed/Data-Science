Q:

Multiple errors launching openni.launch: "Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node"

Hi,everybody! I entered "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch" in the terminal, then I got the following response.
......
[ERROR] [1317043259.886787650]: Unable to open camera calibration file [/home/llq/.ros/camera_info/depth_A00364A05003107A.yaml]

[ERROR] [1317043261.134411949]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/theora/set_parameters]

I have been solving this problem all day long but I failed.

try launching the file and then do a rostopic hz on the image and cloud topics. If it is publishing data then the node came up properly despite the error. I would then try to see if there are any orphaned processes that could be causing the error.

Thank you Asomerville. I have tried to use openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch, but the problem is that I can't use rviz to display PointCloud2 data. What should I do to make it successful?
Comment by llqazs on 2011-09-27:
Thank you joq. I can display the image with image_view, but once I use rviz to display PointCloud2 data, my computer crashed. And there was no information file saved in the camera_info folder.
Comment by Asomerville on 2011-09-26:
llqazs, I'm not familiar wtih openni_launch/launch/openni.launch or why it might not work, but openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch works for my purposes and might be worth trying.
Comment by Asomerville on 2011-09-26:
I'm not sure if he/she's doing something special, but I believe the openni package is supposed to supply the camera calibration info.
Comment by joq on 2011-09-26:
The first two messages just warn that there is no calibration file in the default location. You probably need not worry about that. If you do calibrate the camera, the data will be stored there.

A:

Like joq said, you don't have to worry about the error message regarding the calibration file.
I had the same problem of "Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node". A solution can be found here. The second answer explains the reason behind this error message and how to get rid of it.
