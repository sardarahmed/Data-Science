Q:

Command not found roscd, rosnode, etc

I follow this tutorial to get ROS in my mac:
http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/OSX/MacPorts/Repository
I followed it and seems that everything is working perfect, but when I try roscd or rosnode it says command not found. Does anybody know how to solve it?

A:

@FelipC can you verify that you have rosbash in your workspace which you installed? This package provides the bash functions which you seem to be missing. You can look for it in the src/ros_comm folder.
