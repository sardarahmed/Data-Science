Q:

robot_pose_ekf doesn't output

Hi. I am trying to use robot_pose_ekf. However It doesn't work.
Here is the wtf output
 Input:
 * Odometry sensor
  - is NOT active
  - received 0 messages
  - listens to topic 
 * IMU sensor
  - is active
  - received 15523 messages
  - listens to topic /AHRS8_data
 * Visual Odometry sensor
 - is active
 - received 706 messages
 - listens to topic /WH_DVL_data
 Output:
  * Robot pose ekf filter
  - is active
  - sent 0 messages
  - pulishes on topics /robot_pose_ekf/odom and /tf

then after a while, I got the error
 [ERROR]filter time older than vo message buffer

thank you very much for your time.
regards

A:

There is a possibility of mis match in the frame on which Odometry sensor publishes data and the frame on which ROBOT_POSE_EKF expects the data.
