Q:

Ros and Anaconda on an OS X homebrew installI

I'm trying to get ROS to play nicely with my Anaconda python. I know the prevailing answer to this problem is. "Don't." but I need Anaconda for other elements of my workflow.
My main issue is this:
$ roswtf
Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
Abort trap: 6

which seems to be the result of the wrong python being called. What I'm not sure about is how ROS binaries know which python version to use. Does anyone have experience with this?

A:

The version of python that gets called is the one on your PATH that matches the #! line in the script. There are several places however that the python interpreter is cached during the build and installation phases that might catch you up with a problem.
