Q:

ROSJOY settings

Hi, I'm running on Ubuntu 12.04 and hydro,
When using a joystick with my computer I see it assigned as js1. With nothing plugged into my computer, when I run the command  ls /dev/input/' there is a js0 listed, I don't know what it is.
Anyway, when I use rosrun joy joy_node I get an error
[ERROR] [1407853001.741326266]: [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at [localhost:11311].  Retrying...

unless I first do
rosparam set joy_node/dev "/dev/input/js1"

but I need to do this every time I use ROS. Is there a way to save the setting or something like that?

A:

You can make a launch file and set that as the port you want to use.
