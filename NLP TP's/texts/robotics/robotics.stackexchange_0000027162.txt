Q:

Confusion Regarding Gazebo 4 and ROS Installation

I have been trying to install Gazebo 4 along with ROS Indigo in the following method:
    1. Install ros-indigo-desktop-full
    2. Run sudo apt-get remove gazebo-* (I realized that it also removes ROS)
    3. Following along the source installation instructions for Gazebo 4 on this page (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install), which resulted in a problem related to this question (http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/7224/gazebo-4-installation-fails-on-make-j4/)

Is there something I'm doing wrong? An answer I got from a different question here (http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/7008/gazebo-4-installation-help/) yielded a different way to install Gazebo 4 along side ROS Indigo. Am I supposed to just do a desktop install and not a full install? Or would the Gazebo 4 packages automatically override the Gazebo 2 ones that came with Indigo?

A:

I recommend this tutorial, which describes how to use different combinations of ROS and Gazebo versions. Short answer: install ros-indigo-gazebo4-ros-pkgs to use gazebo4 with ROS.

Thank you, I'll try to follow along with it. Should I install the full desktop version of ROS (that includes Gazebo 2), then? Or should I go for the plain desktop version (with rqt, rviz, and robot-generic libraries and no Gazebo)?

Also, should I install ROS first or Gazebo first. I noticed that when I installed ros-indigo-gazebo4-ros-pkgs, ros-indigo-desktop-full was automatically removed.

You can install ros-indigo-desktop-full first and then ros-indigo-gazebo4-ros-pkgs and it will leave any packages that aren't in conflict

It works now! Thank you very much.
