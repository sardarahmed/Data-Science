Q:

P2os and rosaria not connecting to Pioneer P3-AT

I have pioneer p3-at robot and a separate laptop with Ubuntu 14.04 and Ros Indigo properly installed in it.
I downloaded p2os from https://github.com/allenh1/p2os and rosaria from https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria.git
I am connecting robot to laptop via serial(robot) to usb(laptop) converter with RS-232 cable
But every time I run command

sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

Then I logged out and again logged in

sudo chmod 777 -R /dev/ttyUSB0

rosrun rosaria RosAria _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0

But I get this error

shivam@shivam-Inspiron-3542:~$ : rosrun rosaria RosAria

[ INFO] [1422444061.117081691]: RosAria: using port: [/dev/ttyS0]

Could not connect, no robot responding.

Failed to connect to robot.

[ERROR] [1422444067.613784823]: RosAria: ARIA could not connect to robot! (Check ~port parameter is correct, and permissions on port device.)

[FATAL] [1422444067.613882512]: RosAria: ROS node setup failed...

And when I run p2os it shows this

[ERROR] [1349087058.764888277]: Error reading packet header from robot connection: P2OSPacket():Receive():read():

.

[ERROR] [1349087114.446749752]: Error reading packet header from robot connection: P2OSPacket():Receive():read():

[ERROR] [1349087114.447846009]: p2os setup failed...

[p2os-1] process has died [pid 12089, exit code 255]

Robot is working properly. I tried it with Aria Library which comes with p3-at.
Actually robot has windows-7 installed in its onboard pc which I think should not be a problem
because I am connecting it using the serial port of the robot. And no where it mentions that robot's OS is important

A:

When you run RosAria or p2os you can specify the port via a port parameter. e.g.  rosrun rosaria RosAria _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 or rosrun p2os p2os_driver _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0.     When you tested it with ARIA, did you alse specify the /dev/ttyUSB0 as the port (e.g. demo -rp /dev/ttyUSB0)?
You can turn off the internal onboard computer with the switch on the side. This will give you extra battery life and prevent any possible interference with anything on that computer also using the serial port.

I am using the port /dev/ttyUSB0, I am supplying it as a parameter in RosAria and p2os both. "Turn Off the on-board computer" - the serial port is on the on-board computer, I think if I turn it off then serial port won't work. Or is there any other serial port inside the robot
Comment by ReedHedges on 2016-06-10:
Yes you should use the HOST/SERIAL port on the left side of the robot if you are using an added laptop, that is the connection to the robot's controller.   (Which is also connected to the internal computer as well.)

So you mean I need to open the robot's top plate to access the Host Serial Port because I don't See it in P3-AT on the side
Comment by ReedHedges on 2016-06-10:
Sorry on the P3AT its on the top, next to TX, RX, STATUS leds, reset button, battery led, etc.  STATUS should show if the controller is ready, communicating to software etc. TX and RX will show if there is any communication through the serial connection.

Could you please tell me if I need to give any commands on the robot to connect via serial port. I know you said turn off the onboard computer and I did, but it still could not connect. So we don't need to give any permissions, just connect the serial cable to the robot and run the command on laptop
