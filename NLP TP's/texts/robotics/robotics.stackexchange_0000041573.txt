Q:

calibration and registration

$ rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui
And select /camera/driver
Enable the depth_registration checkbox
Dose this registration display an alternative to openni for Extrinsic Calibration?
unless, what is the relation between calibration and registration?

A:

Registration aligns the depth data and color data to output colorized points.  It uses the factory measured intrinsic calibration of the sensor.
