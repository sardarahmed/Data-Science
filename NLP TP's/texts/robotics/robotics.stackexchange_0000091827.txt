Q:

How to fix end effector direction to approach object with MoveIt

Hello,
My question is that how to fix end effector orientation to approach object(move forward) with MoveIt?
I already let my robot to move to a given goal position(x, y, z).
If I would like to let robot grasp the object, move and approach it slowly is necessary.
So I want to move the robot 15cm forward by fixed direction of end effector.
As shown in the picture:

Does MoveIt or others have any function can achieve this?
If you can provide me example code with python will be better.
Thanks a lot.

You can use constraint messages to approach, for example as explained in q174095
