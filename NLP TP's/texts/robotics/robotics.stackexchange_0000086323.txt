A:

A change to that font was introduced in RViz some time ago now and announced in [notice] Removal of Arial in rviz caused breaking changes. A related/duplicate question on ROS Answers would be #q271750.
The details about what is going on are in those two posts.

I use Jade.

As to the MoveIt issue: that was resolved in consecutive fixes to the code base, but as ROS Jade has been EOL for quite some time now, it could well be that those fixes never made it to Jade MoveIt.
If you have the possibility, upgrading to ROS Kinetic would probably be the best solution here.

Thank U very much.I've solved this problem by updating my RViz('apt-get install update' & 'apt-get install ros-jade-rviz')

Ok. Good to hear you got it to work. Do note that Jade is EOL though, so it won't receive any more updates to any of the ROS packages in that ROS release.
