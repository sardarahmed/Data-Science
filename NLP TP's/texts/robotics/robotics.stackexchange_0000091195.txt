Q:

rospy.Subscriber

Hello,
Is it necessarily to have a def callback in the rospy.Subscriber? I am asking because I came across one question here. In that question, the asker uses a Subscribe method without def callback.
Thank you

A:

It is not necessary to have a def callback in the rospy.Subscriber constructor(It's an optional argument). However, if no callback functions are set, the messages won't be processed. You can later add callbacks using the add_callback() (source)
If you look at the question that you are referring to, he is using message_filter to approximately synchronise messages and process them together in a single callback, which he registers by calling self.ts.registerCallback(self.callback).
