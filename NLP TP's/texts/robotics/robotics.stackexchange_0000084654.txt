Q:

roscd problems!

I've been having trouble with this command for a while. It started when I was studying "beginner_tutorials". But now, when I'm at tf2, it's annoying.
So, this is usually what I write in my Terminal and these are the answers I receive:
*as@as-Inspiron-1545:~$ cd tutorial_ws
as@as-Inspiron-1545:~/tutorial_ws$ source devel/setup.bash
as@as-Inspiron-1545:~/tutorial_ws$ roscd src
roscd: No such package/stack 'src'
as@as-Inspiron-1545:~/tutorial_ws$ source ~tutorial_ws/devel/setup.bash
bash: ~tutorial_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
as@as-Inspiron-1545:~/tutorial_ws$ source ~/tutorial_ws/devel/setup.bash
as@as-Inspiron-1545:~/tutorial_ws$ roscd src
roscd: No such package/stack 'src'
as@as-Inspiron-1545:~/tutorial_ws$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/as/tutorial_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share*

Mention that in ~/.bashrc I have these lines:
*source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash #source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/tutorial_ws/devel/setup.bash*

Any help to clarify would be grateful

Thank you.

A:

roscd <pkg> brings you to a package. src is just the source folder of the workspace, and no package. I'm pretty positive that no tutorial tells you to do a roscd src, for that matter.
roscd tf2 e.g. brings you to the location of the tf2 package, e.g.
FYI, with catkin, the latest sourced Setup.bash wins. There is no Need to have multiple in the ~/.bashrc.

Thank you. I re-read about workspaces and packages. They have not been clear enough, but it seems to be a beginning.
