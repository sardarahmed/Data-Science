Q:

New C++ API Documentation for OpenCV

Hi,I have 3 questions:

Is it possible to use the old API C++ for OpenCV while writing code in ROS?
If is not, does anybody know where can I find good documentation for the new OpenCV C++ API? some books I have read only have a tiny percent explaining this new API.
It should be better if I write the code on Python, how complete are the functions in Python comparing to C++ in writing code for ROS?

I'm more interested in the two first questions cause I have more experience writing code in C.
Thanks

A:

Yes. There is even a package, cv_bridge that converts between sensor_msgs/Image and cv::Mat.
The auto-generated API documentation is quite excellent for the C++ API. In general, I think the C++ API has less of a learning curve than the C API.
Most (if not all) of the C++ functions are wrapped. However, I ran into quite a few functions In OpenCV 2.2 and 2.3 that were completely broken. It's possible that things have improved in OpenCV 2.4.
