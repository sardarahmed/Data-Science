Q:

IPhone controlled RC car

I have an R.C car and there is a program in my computer in which I can code the car to perform movements.I would like to have an application with a visual design.Where it shows the cars path.
Is there available software code for this? Saves me lots of time.

A:

You'd probably have more success with Android, i.e. NXT Remote Control took me 30 seconds to find.
