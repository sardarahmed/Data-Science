Q:

catkin run_tests with stdout output of rostest

I'm using rostest by adding add_rostest in CMakelists.txt, and catkin_tools to build it.
I know how to test specific package with catkin run_tests pkg --no-deps, but no idea to write the test's stdout to the screen like rostest --text hoge.test.
Anyone who know about this?

A:

Though you've probably figured this out already, you can catkin_test_results for that these days.
http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/run_tests.html
UPDATE 20180529 For catkin_tools, passing workspace folder path to catkin_test_results works. Some examples:
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_test_results

Or
catkin_test_results --verbose ~/catkin_ws

The question was about catkin tools, the link you provided is about catkin_make. I tired but there is no test_results folder after running catkin run_tests or catkin test

@Mehdi. Thanks for pointing that out. I've updated my post.
