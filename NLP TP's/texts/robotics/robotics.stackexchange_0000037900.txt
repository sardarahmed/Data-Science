Q:

turtlebot 1.0 calibration

I just updated to the most recent debs:
ii  ros-electric-turtlebot                     0.9.0-s1329169192~lucid
ii  ros-electric-turtlebot-apps                0.9.0-s1329172196~lucid
ii  ros-electric-turtlebot-robot               1.0.0-s1329209176~lucid
Now when I:
roslaunch turtlebot_calibration calibrate.launch
I get a neverending stream of errors:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1329273192.794075] bad callback: <bound method ScanToAngle.scan_cb of <main.ScanToAngle instance at 0x2918200>>

A:

Is the robot in front of a wall? Does the wall appear in the laser scan? I just pushed a small change that will hide the error message (it will be a day or so before this makes it into the debians), but the bottom line is that your robot cannot see a wall in front of it.
