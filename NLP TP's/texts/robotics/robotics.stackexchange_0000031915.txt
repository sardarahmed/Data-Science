Q:

Is there already a Lego Mindstorms NXT simulation in Gazebo?

The NXT wiki page says: "... and in the future we hope to add simulation capabilities in gazebo, our 3D simulator." Did anybody already do any work in that direction? What would still have to be done?

A:

Work has not begun on NXT in gazebo. What needs to be done is port the NXT meshes to a format readable by Gazebo (Collada or STL are the best), and then write plugins for the various actuators and sensors.
If you want to start work on this, just ask for more help and we can provide you with some more guidance.
