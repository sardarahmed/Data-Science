Q:

Rospy and udp sockets

Hi,
I want to send data (x,y and yaw values) over UDP to a system that isn't running ROS (a myRIO or any other micro-controller)
I am using a code written in in python (ROSpy) by someone in else that processess the data from the camera.
What I have read online is that I can't send data over udp. Can I not create a socket like this?
If not, is it possible to change the code from python to c++ so that I can use UDP?
I'm sorry if the question seem stupid but this is my first experience with python and ROS.

Without knowing where you've read this or why that is claimed this is a bit of a dangerous statement, but I would say that is untrue.
There is no magic to rospy, ROS Python programs are just regular programs, so UDP should work.

This is from #q28322.
I understand that they are normal codes, that is why I am confused.
If I post a code would you be able to have a look at it quickly, (the code is only 49 lines)??

A:

That question is specifically about whether the rospy and rosjava client libraries (ie: the Python and Java code that implements the ROS networking and other infrastructure parts) can use UDP.
It is not about whether general use of UDP is possible in rospy.

I must of misunderstood the question. Thanks for clearing it up.
I'm going to assume that sending the data obtained by ROS using UDP is possible.
Thanks!!!!
