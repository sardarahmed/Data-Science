Q:

pluginlib tutorial missing instructions

The tutorial says: Open up an editor and paste the following into polygon_plugins.xml
Where should this file be located; in which folder? Or does it not matter?
This instruction is just after the title:
Making the Plugins Available to the ROS Toolchain
The tutorial seemed to be straight forward up to this point; THANKS for the tutorials!
