Q:

Can't run rtabmap from roslaunch

I installed rtabmap with $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rtabmap-ros but I'm not able to launch it as expected:
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch
[rtabmap.launch] is neither a launch file in package [rtabmap_ros] nor is [rtabmap_ros] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Because I installed a premade binary do I need to create my own launch files? If so, where/how do I do that?
I've tried to build from source but I'm running into a number of pcl/openni issues. Both are installed and working but I believe there's some sort of conflict with how I built one or both of them. Unfortunately the error output is so long that it fills up the terminal so far that I can't even scroll up to see the beginning. I'm recompiling PCL right now with all related options enabled to see if that will help (it's taking some time).
Suggestions?
** EDIT **
I trying to compile on both an armv7 and x86_64. Here's the much smaller error output of the armv7:
$ make

[  7%] Built target res_tool

make[2]: *** [../bin/rtabmap] Error 1
make[1]: *** [app/src/CMakeFiles/rtabmap.dir/all] Error 2

Do I need to add the OrganizedFastMesh file somewhere?

The binaries (0.10) don't install rtabmap.launch. You can have the same functionality with rgbd_mapping.launch or stereo_mapping.launch like in the tutorials.

A:

This was either a PCL or OpenNi issue but I'm not sure which. I reformatted my pc and installed ROS followed by rtabmap and everything worked fine.
I may have been able to install https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros.git anyway but I had reinstalled Ubuntu before I found out I could build the rtabmap launch tools independently.
