Q:

sending a sequence of goals to move_base

Hi all,
I have a mobile robot which is navigating around a room and it can go from start to goal without any issues. Now, I want to send a sequence of goals to move_base so that once the robot reaches its first goal, it automatically starts moving to its second goal and so on. One way which I can think of is to send a second goal when the robot reaches its first goal but how can I know that the robot has reached its first goal automatically? Does it publish anything on any topic once it reaches the goal or is any flag set or changed? Does anyone have any idea about how can it be done or is there a better way to send a sequence of goals to move_base so that the robot just keeps on going from one goal to another?
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

You should use the Action API of move_base.
