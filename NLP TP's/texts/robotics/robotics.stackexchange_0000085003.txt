Q:

Error while connecting two ROS machine to the same MASTER (one is Raspbian jessie, one is Linux in VBox)

HI everyone,
I have been trying to learn how to connect two ROS machines to the same master. I am using Linux in Virtual machine (VBox) , and raspbian jessie, and i want the master to run on the linux. what i did was both ROS are kinetic
when i run the linux, i do these steps:
1- hostname -I
i think the first one for the Virtual machine and the second id for the main OS with is MAC OS
 10.0.2.15  10.0.3.1

2-export ROS_IP=10.0.2.15
3-roscore
then i move to the raspbian jessie:
1- hostname -I
 10.0.0.8   2601:1c:8601 ......etc <<very long address with letters and numbers

2-export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.0.2.15:11311/
3-export ROS_IP=10.0.0.8
each machine can ping itself, but
when i ping the ROS on jessie from linux to seems to work and give me something like
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=63 time=39.868 ms
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=9.677 ms
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=38.659 ms

but when i ping the linux from jessie
it does not work, it fails.
so does anyone know how to solve that?
*edit 1:
when i try to run roscore on jessie it runs with master 10.0.0.8 even though i assigned export
 ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.0.2.15:11311/

so it looks that it did not get it !?
*edit2:
after running netcat i found out that the linux machine can see the raspbian but
the raspbian can not see the linux

it does not work, it fails

What does this mean? Also, being able to ping isn't sufficient. Check out http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup#Further_check:_netcat

it means that it says something like:
3 packet transmitted , 0 received , 100% packet loss, time 1024 ms

Are you setting the environment variables and running everything from the same terminal? Once you open a new terminal you have to set the environment variables all over again.
Comment by Mohammedism on 2018-01-28:
yes, i added them to the ~/.bashrc and i also set them manually in every terminal.
as i said some machine A sees B
bug B does not see A
or at least this is what i understood
is it possible the problem is that the linux in running in virtual machine?
Comment by jayess on 2018-01-28:
Yes, that does change things. Definitely update and retag your question indicating that you're using a virtual machine.

oh thanks for the notes, i will update it

A:

It's look like a problem with vbox network configuration, the vbox create a subnet inside the computer and to access from outside you need to configure the vbox. Try following this tutorial.

thanks man, i figured out what was the problem. I had my network attached to NAT which will use the main machine ip address, with an extension, which wont work. so i had to attach my virtual machine to bridget wifi adaptor, which will give the VM separate ip
