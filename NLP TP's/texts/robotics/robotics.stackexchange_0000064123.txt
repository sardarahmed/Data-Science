Q:

Image_view frozen image

I am using image_view on a Jetson tegra - Ubuntu 14.04 Indigo.  When I run Image view, I get a frozen image (One frame). Usually I get no error messages, occasionally I dee [ 4002.992926] uvcvideo: Failed to query (SET_CUR) UVC control 4 on unit 1: -32 (exp. 4).  in dmesg.  Topics are being echo'ed.
If I run image-view on a remote laptop(Indigo 14.04), I get a moving image, but multiple error messages of:
QMetaMethod::Invoke: Unable to invoke methods with return values in queued connections
Also I can't kill the process with control-c I need to kill the terminal session.
Further because image_view works just fine when the remote node is running hydro on an AMD-64 running Ubuntu 12.04.
Guess I need a witch doctor and a rattle to figure out this one.
