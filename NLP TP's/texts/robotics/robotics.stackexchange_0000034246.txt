Q:

flyer_sim package

I was looking for a quadrotor simulator, and found the starmac flyer_sim package on the ROS wiki http://www.ros.org/wiki/flyer_sim
The linked repo however does not contain the flyer_sim package any more. Also the starmac_flyer stack does not list it any longer. What happened to the flyer_sim package?

A:

Looks like flyer_sim got moved to the simulated_quadrotor package in the repo.
See starmac-ros-pkg:c0accc574817 for details.

Thanks! I took the liberty to add the missing wiki page for it: http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulated_quadrotor
