Q:

Estimate Disparity Error for Depth Accuracy Estimation

I would like to get a rough estimate of the depth accuracy / uncertainty of a stereo camera system. For this I would like to use the basic formula in the attached image. What is still unclear to me is what's a reasonable choice for the disparity error $\Delta$D. Unfortunately, for example this answer (in point "Resolution") describes the assumption of the size of the disparity error only very quickly. 
Is a reasonable assumption just the width of one pixel? Why yes, why not?

A:

The answer is that the Disparity error depends on the accuracy of the matching algorithm which matches the points in the two images. Some of these algorithms have an accuracy of one pixel, some achieve even sub-pixel accuracy.
