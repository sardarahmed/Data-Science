Q:

Which ROS2 Distro? Iron or Humble?

I have some experience on ROS and now planning to switch to ROS2.
Just installed a fresh Ubuntu 22.04. Which ROS2 distro should I use? Iron or Humble?
I am assuming Humble has more stable packages and options for a newcomer. But, if the Humble packages work on Iron too, that might change things.
On the other hand, Iron's EOL is pretty close (2024) compared to Humble's (2027). Would appreciate some help.

A:

Humble can be a better choice as it has LTS, there will be more stable package releases and more support on he core. Also you can discuss this type of topics at discourse.ros.org
