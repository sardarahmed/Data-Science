Q:

No octop map after point subsample?

If I set point_subsample in sensors_rgbd.yaml to a value != the default 1, e.g. 0.5, my planning scene no longer contains a octomap. What can I do?

A:

I have solved the problem by looking into the code:
point_subsample only takes integer values.
Setting e.g. point_subsample: 5 works
