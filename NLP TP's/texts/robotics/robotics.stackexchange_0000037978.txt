Hii ,
By default the old version of pcl get installed which is 1.1.
Standalone version of pcl1.4 works fine but when I try the unstable version I am getting an error this is what I have done to make pcl1.4 working in ros.

download perception_pcl_unstable to my ros_workspace folder.

then did rosmake, but I get an error about deserialization.

Can somebody please help me out.
Thank you.

I have even done this : Download perception_pcl_unstable from SVN and overlay it to your
electric installation by placing it first in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.   export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/perception_pcl_unstable:/opt/ros/electric/stacks:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Can you post the exact error you're getting, and the svn path you're checking out?

@ Diaz, I am srry but I posted this question in pcl forum, and they are helping me with it. But to help others, I was getting an error regarding desearialize. Then the authors at pcl.org told me to change my svn_url to point it to new version of pcl. I did that thing by uncommenting it in makefile in pcl.

A:

After discussion on pcl-users@pointclouds.org, it became clear that @faizan was installing the standalone PCL 1.4 library and not the unstable version of the perception_pcl ROS stack.
It remains to be seen exactly what svn URL is needed to answer this question fully.
EDIT:
Another option is installing the ALPHA version of the ROS Fuerte distribution, which includes PCL 1.4.
Beware: Fuerte is still very much a work in progress.

Now that PCL 1.5.1 is out and they are shooting for 1.6 by end of March, why can't we setup PCL as an external library like we did with opencv? Then this would question could extend to flann, cminpack, etc

Setting up PCL as an external library is in progress for fuerte.
