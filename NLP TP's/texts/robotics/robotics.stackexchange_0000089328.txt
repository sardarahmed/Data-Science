Q:

Cannot load message class for [kobuki_msgs/BumperEvent]. Are your messages built?

Hi all, I have a turtlebot2 hooked onto a laptop and configured a remote pc/workstation to access it as well. catkin packets created on the remote pc are running smoothly on the turtlebot, but when I try to get the data from some /mobile_base/... topics such as /mobile_base/events/bumper It says,

BumperEvent from kobuki_msgs.msg
module not found

When I try to echo the rostopic from the kobuki notebook, I dont get anything. the console just stays there locked forever till I terminate it.
When I try to do the same from the remote pc, I get the

cannot load message class for [kobuki_msgs/BumperEvent].

actually from the /mobile_base ... only the  /mobile_base/debug/... work. the reset give the cannot load message error from the remote pc. However, other, topics such as cmd_mux_vel ... work without issues.
What could be the cause of this?
How can I resolve it?
Thanks alot in advance.
PS. according to the kobuki_dashboard -> /mobile_base_nodelet_manager, all the topics are published. and rosmsg show works fine.

@gvdhoorn, can you convert this to an answer so that I can accept it?

A:

Have you installed all the relevant TB2 packages on your laptop and remote pc/workstation?
You must have the message pkgs installed on all hosts that wish to participate in the communication, or things won't work.
