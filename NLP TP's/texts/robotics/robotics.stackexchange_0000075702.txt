Q:

How to control rviz view parameters programatically?

I would like to control the rviz view parameters programatically from an external node, for instance:
Set the view type to topDownOrtho and set the scale parameter to 10 and angle to 3.14.
I guess that this is possible to control these parameters using the rviz.h library , but what I essentially wonder is if there is something already developed to control rviz from an external node via topics.
Otherwise, how would you develop a system that it is able to control these parameters from a python node?

There are some view controllers for rviz which either track a frame or are controllable from data published on a ROS topic. I don't know the details, but most of them are packaged as rviz plugins outside of the stock rviz package.

Interesting, I will check it

A:

You can probably use the rviz_animated_view_controller for this.

This looks promising. I will try it and I will notify how it works.
