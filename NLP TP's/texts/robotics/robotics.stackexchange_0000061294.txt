Q:

sphero_ros with indigo

Hello, I a learning ROS and I have installed indigo and I am running ubuntu 14.04. I have a sphero that I would like to experiment with and I have tried installing the sphero package via "apt-get install sphero_ros" but apt-get cant seem to find the package. I have checked that ubuntu allows "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse".

Is there something else I need to do to tell ubuntu where to find this package?

The only documentation i can find for this package is for groovy. Are packages for older ROS distros viable for new distros?

Thanks in advance for your help

A:

It looks like the docs are wrong about the package name in the tutorials. Since the docs are part of the repository, you should file a bug against the sphero_ros bugtracker

It looks like they haven't released a version of spehro_ros for any of the newer ROS releases, so you won't be able to use the packaged version. You should still be able to install sphero_ros from source: https://github.com/mmwise/sphero_ros
