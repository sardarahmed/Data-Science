Q:

How to make image_proc from source? Missing opencv2 dependency

Hi,
I am trying to install image_proc (non-catkin one) from source. However, its dependency opencv2 (electric version) deprecated. Does image_proc need opencv2 dependency anymore? Can I just delete opencv2 dependency from manifest.xml of image_proc?
This is the output of rosdep install image_proc:
root@linaro-alip:~/catkin_ws/src/image_pipeline-electric/image_proc# rosdep install image_proc
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
image_proc: Missing resource smclib
ROS path [0]=/root/ros_core_ws/install/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/root/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/root/ros_core_ws/install/share
ROS path [3]=/root/ros_core_ws/install/stacks

Thanks in advance!!!

A:

As of ROS Electric, OpenCV is used as a rosdep system dependency:

I use gumstix Overo, I cannot use the cammand "rosdep install image_proc". I need to build from source. Do you know how to do that? Thanks!

I haven't used ROS with Gumstix yet so correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I read here you should be able to use rosdep (although it might take an eternity to compile things natively instead of cross-compiling): http://wiki.gumstix.org/index.php?title=ROS

Hi, georgebrindeiro, I updated the error that I got when I run command "rosdep install image_proc".
