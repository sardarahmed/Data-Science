Q:

To install ROS .debs by specifying their versions?

As the title says, I'd like to know if there's any way in ROS to install by specifying .deb version.
apt-get allows to install specific version of .deb; by following this link I can do like:
$ apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-comm=1.9.50-0precise-20131007-1614-+0000

But apparently the error occurs when I specify an older version (this version should be valid since I checked from here):
$ apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-comm=1.9.48-0precise-20130824-0432-+0000
E: Version '1.9.48-0precise-20130824-0432-+0000' for 'ros-hydro-ros-comm' was not found

I assume this error happens because the .deb repo I use (shadow-fixed) does not keep the older versions. I refrain from trying to hack too much into ROS' .deb repository to find a URL that could provide older .debs to apt-get. I'd rather ask for official ways to achieve this if any.
If there's .deb archive available that would be easy solution, but I don't stick to it. Thanks!

Background of this question; we've been talking to some corporate users and found that they tend to "freeze" the fundamental software (that we've been maintaining) once they have built it from source for a stability reason, often very long time ago so that the software can be obsolete compared to its recent versions. Now that we've been shifting to provide the same software from .deb, which is by itself very convenient and appreciated, the new issue here is apt-get with certain upgrade option replaces with the latest version.
So back to the original question, if there's a way to specify the older version numbers to install, that would be extremely useful for users who want to focus on their development.

A:

You can't specify the older versions from packages.ros.org, they get removed when newer versions are added to the repository. If you want to lock to a specific version, you will probably have to create and host your own mirror of the debian repository, using a tool such as debmirror.

Helpful to know debmirror. Now I've escalated to wonder how to take a snapshot of all (or as available as possible) depended packages. Maybe better to be asked somewhere beyond ROS community?

apt-mirror as described in this updated wiki page works pretty good for me http://wiki.ros.org/Mirrors#Creating_a_packages.ros.org_mirror to obtain all built .debs at the moment.
