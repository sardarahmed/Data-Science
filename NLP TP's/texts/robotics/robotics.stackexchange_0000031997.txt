Q:

How to update multiple ROS machines simultaneously?

Hi everyone!
So here's my problem...
I have 6 netbooks with Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS c-turtle. When I first installed everything I did so on the first netbook and cloned the image to the other 5.
Now I want to update ROS to diamondback, I could do the update one by one, but I'm guessing there is a faster way! What options do I have to update/install ROS and manage the robot's ROS stacks without having to work on the netbooks one by one?
Thanks for the help in advance,
Gonçalo Cabrita

has anyone created a puppet (http://www.puppetlabs.com/) recipe for ROS?

A:

You can turn on all of your machines and have them connected to the network. Then you can use Cluster SSH to ssh into all of them at once from some master computer and update all of them at once. It will take the same amount of time required to update one machine, to update all of them.
If your 'master' computer is running Ubuntu, you can install cssh by running:
sudo apt-get install clusterssh
