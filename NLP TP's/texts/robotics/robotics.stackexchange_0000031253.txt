Q:

set a goal in the inflated obstacles area

From my understanding, if we set a navigation goal in inflated obstacles, the navigation stack won't give a path plan. So, how can I configure the stack to let the it give a path plan, which navigate the robot to a position near the goal?

A:

The navigation stack will not plan a path to a goal given in an inflated obstacle because a cell marked as such guarantees that any concave robot footprint would be in collision if the center-point of that footprint were placed at that cell. Basically, if the navigation stack were to attempt to achieve such a goal, it would hit something.
If you want the navigation stack to get as close to this goal as possible, you might want to check out the "default_tolerance" parameter that can be set on navfn documented here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/navfn#Parameters. Setting that parameter should allow you to specify goals inside of inflated obstacles where the robot will try to get close.

However seems this value is not used where it's supposed to use.
bool GlobalPlanner::makePlan(const PoseStamped& start, const PoseStamped& goal, double tolerance, std::vector& plan)

Furthermore it is reported but not resolved yet.
