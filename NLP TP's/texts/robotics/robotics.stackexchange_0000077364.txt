Q:

Gazebo Immediately Close on Startup

Hello all,
I am using Ros indigo on Ubuntu 14.04  For some reason I cannot start Gazebo. When I execute gazebo on terminal, it opens the window but after some seconds, it terminates and closes the window. I tried to update Gazebo from 2.2 to 2.2.6 as stated in http://answers.ros.org/question/199401/problem-with-indigo-and-gazebo-22/   I also installed gtk2-engines but none of them worked.
I suspect that it is because of my old graphics card Intel 945GM  but I am not sure.
Here is my terminal output:
yusuf@yusuf-HP-Pavilion-dv6000-RD870AV-ABA:~$ gazebo

Thanks in advance,

A:

I have found a solution to the problem I mentioned. It may not be the best solution, however. Run the command below before running gazebo
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
This resolves the issue with hardware acceleration, but gazebo may work slower depending on your machine
