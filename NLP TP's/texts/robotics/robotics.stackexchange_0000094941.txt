Q:

multiple amcl on one odom

I'm trying to evaluate and compare 2 lidar performance at the same time on the same robot. I know amcl can only take in one odom at a time, is this possible?

A:

I guess you misunderstood something. (Or I might be misunderstanding what you try to do).
Comparing the performance of 2 lidars by doing localization in a given map should be doable by running two amcl instances side by side. You only need to make sure to set tf_broadcast to false for at least one of the two nodes.
However, this then has nothing to do with amcl taking in multiple odoms (as you say). amcl retrieves the odom->base_link transform via tf. And then outputs the transform from  map->odom (if enabled).
You then need to compare the published amcl_pose and particle_cloud topics (make sure to remap those to unique names).

Thank you. This works. However, I'm facing this issue to determine which lidar is better as I have no ground truth for these amcl_pose. The only ground truth that I can think of is to create a path for the robot and run pure pursuit but how do I compare them?
