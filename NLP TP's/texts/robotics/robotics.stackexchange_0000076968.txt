Q:

how to publish real robot-arm joint_states by ROS

Hello,
I have a real six-dof robot arm and it's urdf model, the urdf model can display well in rviz.
Now I want to publish robot's joint_states so the rviz can show out the real robot pose.
But I find that joint_state_publisher node will also publish joint_states topic, and the node is need when visual urdf in rviz, so I  don't know how to resolve the conflict between my own node and joint_state_publisher node, thanks for some tips!

A:

This looks like a duplicate of How to visualize a real robot in Rviz, but just to reiterate:
If you have a node that already publishes joint states for your real robot, then you don't need to start joint_state_publisher.
An instance of joint_state_publisher is only needed if:

you don't have another node that publishes JointState messages and you want to fake them (use_gui:=true)
you have multiple publishers of JointState messages and want to aggregate them (source_list:=[..])

[..] I don't know how to resolve the conflict between my own node and joint_state_publisher node [..]

Just don't start joint_state_publisher (but see the points above).
