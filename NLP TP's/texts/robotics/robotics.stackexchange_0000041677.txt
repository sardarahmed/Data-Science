Q:

Is roboearth going through an intense week of migrating to fuerte?

Hi,
I have noticed that in past 7/8 days, roboearth source has changed very vigorously. I have been able to install roboearth on ubuntu 12.04 with fuerte. However, when running re_object_recorder gui, when I try to save the model, i get the following error:
OpenCV is NOT compiled with SURF support.
This problem, I am assuming comes from the fact that SURF and SIFT are now patented and are available with OpenCV as 3rd-party nonfree libraries.
Could this be the reason why I was not able to save models?
Has this problem been/being resolved at the moment?
I will appreciate any help.
Thanks in advance

A:

Sorry, this was my mistake, I guess I was a bit careless with committing. As I am currently not at my office, I will fix this next week when I am back.
