Q:

List of possible exit codes from Roslaunch

So I've been seeing exit codes come out of roslaunch, example:
[process name] process has died [pid 1234, exit code -11].

I have seen mostly negative exit codes.  Are these signals/bash exit codes?  -11 appears to be a Seg Fault.  What's -6?
Is there a chart of the possible values it could send out and does it send out user exit codes as well?

A:

By convention, a negative exit code corresponds to the number of the signal that caused the process to die.  E.g., -11 is SIGSEGV, and -6 is SIGABRT.  For a list of signals, have a look at /usr/include/bits/signum.h (at least on my Ubuntu Lucid system, that's where they're defined).
Btw, this behavior and the meaning of the numbers isn't specific to roslaunch; roslaunch is just reporting back the exit code that the process gave when it died.

I found the file with find /usr -name signum.h in /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/signum.h

You can also use kill -l to get a list of signals with their numbers.
