Q:

Is it possible to start rxgraph or rxplot via roslaunch

or do I have to execute this tools separately?
Thanks for your effort and help

What happens if you do rosdep install rx?

Does rxplot work on your system when run directly as a command?

A:

You can execute rxplot from a launch file by adding something like this:
<node pkg="rxtools" type="rxplot" name="plot_speed"
      args="/odom/twist/twist/linear/x" />

I don't know how to execute rxgraph like that. Maybe we should open a defect ticket.

rxgraph is not a ROS node, as such the arguments roslaunch adds are a problem.  A possible feature request for roslaunch would be to launch non ROS node executables.
