Q:

(How) Is it possible to set nodes' "args" attribute from a parameter?

In launch files nodes have an "args" attribute that are used to pass command line arguments to a node. It is sometimes important to get those arguments from another place; from a parameter, for example.
Is there a way to do this?

A:

No, you cannot get that value from a parameter unless your code explicitly looks for a parameter.

Actually the other way around would be simpler: Always read from a parameter and pass _myparam:=value as a cmd line parameter.
