Q:

gazebo world frame

When I used the gazebo simulation of turbobot3, I encountered a thing that confused me. I used the gmapping algorithm to build a grid map. I found that the location of the odom and map coordinate systems was not in the initial position of the robot. In principle, shouldn't the odom and map coordinate systems be generated at the initial position of the robot?
The following picture describes my problem:

A:

Perfect odometry with zero slip would yield no difference between odometry and map coordinates, provided odometry was initialized to be correct with the map when the robot was started.
When robot comes on it assumes the odometry starts at (0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 0, 0) but that isn't where the robot really is, usually.
The correction expression you're looking for is the map -> odom transform. It is the correction vectors between map and odom frames.
