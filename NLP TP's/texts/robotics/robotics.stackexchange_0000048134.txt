Q:

applanix_driver stack for Fuerte

Is the applanix_driver stack available for fuerte?
I know the wiki says it is, but I can't find it using aptitude.
The github repository contains only an electric branch, which is not working with fuerte since the python structure has changed.

We'll check the builds.

A:

We have updated our public github to include the fuerte and triggered the builds. It should work for you now. Thanks for the heads-up!
