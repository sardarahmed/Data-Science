A:

See this Q/A which is an earlier duplicate of your question by someone else. As noted also there, hector_object_tracker was called object_tracker before, so older launch files might not work out of the box.

Hello Stefan! When I urn hector_geotiff ,  I get a error message like this QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3 . I don't know the reason.
