Q:

import org.ros.rosjava.android.MessageCallable error

Hi all:
I downloaded source from https://code.google.com/p/rosjava.android/. And I rosmake android_tutorial_pubsub. Then I imported this project into Eclipse. However, I got errors, which are
import org.ros.rosjava.android.MessageCallable;
import org.ros.rosjava.android.views.RosTextView;
It seems that the project did not import org.ros.rosjava.android.*
Does anyone could help me? Thanks!!!!!!!!!

A:

It sounds like there is a Android library dependency. Check that the project properties has a green check mark next to the android_gingerbread library. You probably have not imported the necessary Android library projects into Eclipse.
