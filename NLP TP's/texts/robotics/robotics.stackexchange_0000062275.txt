Q:

Is there a way to find the definition of a class or function quickly in ROS?

In my project, there are several packages and some classes use inheritance... Is there a way to quickly find class and function instead of open all the related source files one by one in ROS?...........
Thanks!

A:

Well, this is not a ROS specific problem, but you could use an IDE such as Eclipse to help you with that.
In Eclipse, you can set the mouse over a function name or a class name and right click -> Open Definition to open the file where the name that you are highlighting is defined.
