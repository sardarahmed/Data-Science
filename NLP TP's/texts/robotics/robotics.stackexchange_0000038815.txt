Q:

rosjava on android emulator

Hello people!
Has anyone ever tried to run a rosjava app on an android emulator, with the ros-master on the host system (not on the emulator)?
I need such a configuration, but I don't know how to set it up.
greets

A:

I do not recommend using the Android emulator (performance is really bad). In theory, you could set things up using adb port forwarding: http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html#forwardports
In practice, this isn't really possible since rosjava does not currently allow you to configure port ranges that should be used. Please file a feature request if that is something you need: http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/list

Thank you for the hint! I already tried several emulator networking stuff on that website you posted. Now I know why nothing worked ;) Well, sometimes it would be handy having an emulator capable of ROS stuff ...
