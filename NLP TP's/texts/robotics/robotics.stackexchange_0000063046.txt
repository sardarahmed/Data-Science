Q:

[HELP!]Has indigo vmware or virtual-box image file?

I know ROS Hydro Medusa has a pre-installed virtual machine file with Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS .

Alternatively, you can use a virtual machine with Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and ROS Hydro Medusa pre-installed. It is packaged in an .ova file of approx. 3.7GB that you can run on VirtualBox or other virtualization engines.
ROS indigo has this ?
