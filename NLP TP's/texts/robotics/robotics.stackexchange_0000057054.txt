Q:

how to install rosserial package

I installed ros hydro full desk top version. I have been trying to install the rosserial package, rosserial_xbee in particular, but failed. The error prompted in the terminal reads" unable to locate the package"? Does any have suggestions? Thanks!

What is the exact command that you're trying to run?

Hi Ahendrix. The command I run was "sudo apt-get install rosserial_xbee".

A:

rosserial is not included in any desktop variant. You need to install it in addition to the default system, and the recommended way is to install one of the supported platforms (at this time that includes arduino and embedded_linux):
 sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rosserial-arduino

In addition, the xbee package is not included with any of these, so:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rosserial-xbee
