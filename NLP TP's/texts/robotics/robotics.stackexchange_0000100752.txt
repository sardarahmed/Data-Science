Q:

How to use a trained learning model (.sav) in ROS python node?

Hello,
I created a learning model (by MLP method) by using the Jupyter notebook. Now, I want to use it in a ROS python node. How I can load the trained model?
In Jupyter notebook, I can use the following code to load a trained model:
# load the model from disk
1) filename = r"C:\Users\....\TrainedModelName.sav"
2) loaded_model = pickle.load(open(filename, 'rb'))

However, by using code line 1 in the ROS python node, I receive the error. (I changed the address according to the Ubuntu directory)

Have you installed the libraries in your system?

Yes, all were installed.

A:

I was using "~" for the directory. When I used "home/my username/" the problem was solved.
