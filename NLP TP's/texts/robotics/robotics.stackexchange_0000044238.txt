Q:

Contributing rosdep rules for Debian

Hi,
I have successfully installed ROS Fuerte on a Debian Squeeze machine. Along the way, I ran into problems with unmet dependencies/undefined build rules, similar to those described here and here, which required some manual tweaking to resolve. A very useful post was the answer to this question by jamuraa.
I have read the howto on Contributing rosdep rules, and I would like to contribute the necessary rules, so that ROS can be built automatically on Debian through rosdep/rosmake, but I'm confused on how to do it for this particular case. The two major dependencies that currently break rosdep install -a are flann and pcl. Both of these dependencies are not defined in standard rosdep.yaml files, but in this gbpdistro file. Searching the wiki yields only one reference to gbpdistro files, in rep 125.
So, my question is, what is the right way to contribute rosdep rules for installing flann and pcl on Debian, and share this with the community? Should I:
a) create a new yaml file for Debian and override the gpbdistro file, similar to the gentoo.yaml and osx-homebrew.yaml?
b) modify the gpbdistro file in some way?
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

A:

With the similarities between Ubuntu and Debian rules.  It's probably easier to keep them side by side, most of the time they will be the same.
