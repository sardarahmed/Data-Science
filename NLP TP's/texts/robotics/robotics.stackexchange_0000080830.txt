Q:

Transport Image tutorial issue: subscriber doesn't show image

Hello everyone,
I tried to do the tutorial " Running the Simple Image Publisher and Subscriber with Different Transports " image_transport/Tutorials
but I encountered an issue.
When I run the publisher everything seems to work:
rostopic echo /camera returns a matrix and
rostopic hz /camera proves that something is being published frequently
But then, when I want to use the subscriber which aims to display what is sent to /camera I only have a window(with my wallpaper on it) and then it crashes. I saw I was not the only one with this issue but couldn't find a solution.
So please if you have any idea how to help me it could be great. :)

A:

I found out what the error was:
you have to add
 cv::waitKey(30);

after the imshow in the my_subscriber.cpp, otherwise, windows will just pop infinitely with nothing inside.
