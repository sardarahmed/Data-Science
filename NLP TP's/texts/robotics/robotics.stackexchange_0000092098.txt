Q:

How to draw circles with RVIZ markers?

Hello all,
I would like to indicate a special zone around an object (for instance a cube) in RVIZ by a marker. I have looked at the basic_marker tutorial  and it is possible to creat this zone by a LINE_STRIP. But I was wondering if we can create a one like the Interactive Markers. I have looked the documents and I did not find that the circle around the object like the one on ChessPiece is configurable.
Do you have any idea how to do it correctly?
Thanks,

Assuming you just want the circle to look the same as the one used by the interactive markers then you can reproduce it using a triangle list marker and setting the alpha transparency of the whole marker to around 50%.

There are marker types for CUBE, SPHERE and CYLINDER. Would those be sufficient for what you're trying to do?
A circle can be made from a really flat cylinder.
or does it need to be an 'open' circle (ie: not a filled one)?

thanks for your comment @gvdhoorn, I found exactly the CYLINDER shape marker as the easiest solution.

@PeteBlackerThe3rd thanks for your comment.

A:

As I understood, based on your application and your requirement there exist different solutions. For my case as @gvdhoorn mentioned it can be solved by a CYLINDER shape marker.
