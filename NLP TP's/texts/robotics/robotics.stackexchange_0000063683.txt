Q:

How to solve opengl2.1 support problem on PR2?

I use ROS groovy on PR2.
I try to run:
ssh -X pr2admin@192.168.2.101
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

But it says:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Your graphics driver does not support OpenGL 2.1. Please enable software rendering before running RViz (e.g. type 'export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1').

And I follow its solution two ways but never work.
first:
ssh -X pr2admin@192.168.2.101
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

second:
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
ssh -X pr2admin@192.168.2.101
roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

I found that another laptop can run this launch with PR2 without any problem.
How could I solve it?
Thank you~

A:

Don't run graphical software on the PR2. Instead, set your ROS_MASTER_URI to point to the ros master on the PR2 and run graphical programs locally.
