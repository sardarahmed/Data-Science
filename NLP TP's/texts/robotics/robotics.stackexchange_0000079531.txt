Q:

Occupancy Grid Map generation using ROS

Hi,
I am trying to build occupancy grid map in ros using laser data but have no idea from where to start. I dont want to use completely self built package as I am not allowed to use gmapping or hecor. Can anyone please point me in the right direction.

A:

It seems to me that a good place to start is to look at the occupancy grid map message from the nav_msgs package
http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/OccupancyGrid.html
Also look at the laser scan message from sensor_msgs
http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html
To visualize it you will probably want to use rviz with the map display type
http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Map
Now assuming you have a stream of LaserScan messages you just need to figure out the math to map each ray to a grid cell. To do this you need to know the pose of the laser scanner. You will have to translate the ray direction from the laser scanners coordinate frame to the world coordinate frame. The tf package might help with that http://wiki.ros.org/tf
The hard part will be to handle noise and to properly merge together multiple laser scans over time to get a good probabilistic map.
