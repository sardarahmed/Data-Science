Q:

Ground truth from the jackal robot

Hi,
I have a simulation environment using the jackal in gazebo without using the laser scanner.
I have a small program that publishes the velocity commands and subscribes to the odometry topic to get odometer readings.
I have to get the exact position of the robot in order to calculate the shift in the odometry readings.
Is there a topic I can subscribe to, to get the position at any time of the robot?
Would it be the base_link frame which should be considered for this?
In the absence of the laser scanner, how does the jackal calculate its ground truth?
Thanks and regards,

A:

You can use the p3d plugin, it publishes the ground truth pose of the robot via a odometry message. Example use in this Q/A.
