Q:

compile node which uses messages defined in an other machine

Hello everybody
I have a problem. I am using INDIGO.
I am using as ROS MASTER my own account on my pc in communication with ROS running in a virtual machine.
The problem is that I would like to subscribe a message which is defined in the nodes belonging to the virtual machine and not to my catkin folder. So basically when I compile trying to include such message, I get a compilation error saying that this package is not found. (Obviously, because it is defined in the virtual machine).
Is there any workaround for that?
Thank you

A:

This is the reason why there are message-packages. If you have a package foo that contains a lot of algorithms, dependencies and message definitions, you should create a package foo-msgs that contains only the message-definitions.
The original foo package then depends on this foo-msgs. In your case, you'd then only have to install the foo-msgs package on your machine so set up the communication.
