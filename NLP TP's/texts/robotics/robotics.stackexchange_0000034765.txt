Q:

Adding more than one path to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?

Hi there,
I have the following problem when I try to add more than one path to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in my .bashrc. Like this it won't cause any problems

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/alonsoj1/ros_workspace/:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

but when I try to include more than one, f.i.:

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/alonsoj1/ros_workspace/:/home/alonsoj1/ros/

it doesn't work and this is the kind of messages I get when I try to rosmake something:

alonsoj1@aut-228:~/ros_workspace/beginner_tutorials$ rosrun beginner_tutorials talker.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/alonsoj1/ros_workspace/beginner_tutorials/nodes/talker.py", line 2, in 
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('beginner_tutorials')
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/launcher.py", line 75, in load_manifest
sys.path = prefix + _generate_python_path(package_name, [], os.environ) + sys.path
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/launcher.py", line 131, in _generate_python_path
raise roslib.packages.InvalidROSPkgException("While loading package '%s': %s"%(d.package, str(e)))
roslib.packages.InvalidROSPkgException: While loading package 'std_msgs': Cannot locate installation of package std_msgs: [rospack] couldn't find package [std_msgs]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/electric/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/alonsoj1/ros/stacks:/home/alonsoj1/ros_workspace]

Also, when I try to self-complete (with TAB, I mean), I get something like this (FIXED, I had two trailing slashes at the end of the paths, I would have never guessed it would have mattered):

roscd beg[rospack] warning: trailing slash found in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
[rospack] warning: trailing slash found in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
[rosstack] warning: trailing slash found in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
[rosstack] warning: trailing slash found in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Any ideas?
Thanks!

A:

It is important that you keep the original value of ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, i.e. never omit the trailing :$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH when redefining the variable:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/alonsoj1/ros_workspace:/home/alonsoj1/ros:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Also, your paths should not end with a slash, i.e. write /home/alonsoj1/ros instead of /home/alonsoj1/ros**/**
