A:

You don't need external libraries for SIFT and SURF. Just add  #include <opencv2/nonfree/features2d.hpp> and it will work. You initialize your fdeature detector and descriptor using : cv::Ptr<cv::FeatureDetector> detect = new cv::SurfFeatureDetector; and descriptor : cv::Ptr<cv::DescriptorExtractor> detect = new cv::SurfDescriptorExtractor; You could replace the word Surf with Sift or Orb for the feature detector. And you could also replace the descriptor with Sift or Brief.
