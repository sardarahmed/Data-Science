Q:

Generate prerelease script error

Hello everyone,
I'm trying to run a local prerelease using the prerelease command generator website.
In my case it generates the following command:
mkdir -p /tmp/prerelease_job
cd /tmp/prerelease_job
generate_prerelease_script.py \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config/master/index.yaml \
  jade default ubuntu trusty amd64 \
  heatmap \
  --level 1 \
  --output-dir ./

When I run the commands I get the following error message:
Fetching buildfarm configuration...
Fetching rosdistro cache...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/generate_prerelease_script.py", line 263, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())
  File "/usr/bin/generate_prerelease_script.py", line 149, in main
    source_repository.name = 'prerelease'
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'

What's the problem?
