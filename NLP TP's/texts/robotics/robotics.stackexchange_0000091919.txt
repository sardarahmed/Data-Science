Q:

GLib-GObject Error: Mutex Assertion, Aborted Core Dump

I'm trying to run this tutorial (melodic remote PC, kinetic turtlebot 2)
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw 

I confirmed via rostopic list and rostopic echo that there is data being published this this topic from the turtlebot.
The result I got on remote PC was:
[ INFO] [1559771301.130415330]: Using transport "raw"

(image_raw:20170): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: 16:48:21.136: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed
Attempt to unlock mutex that was not locked
Aborted (core dumped)

What did I do wrong?

A:

While I had installed via apt-get install ros-melodic-image-view, somehow removing that and cloning the git repository into my src folder and performing a catkin_make fixed the problem

This is related to this solution, I think the image_view package has to be revised.
