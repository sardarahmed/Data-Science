Q:

Beaglebone not accessible through LAN?

Since the day I bought it I always use ethernet over USB connection, now I need to use RJ45 LAN cable to connect Beaglebone from my laptop, but my laptop can't even detect LAN connection from it, what could go wrong? Do I need straight or crossover cable? Do I need to configure something first on my BeagleBone?

UPDATE: Managed to connect it through Crossover cable and assign it IP
  address by running DHCP server on my laptop.

As seen above my laptop assign IP 169.254.223.76, but when I tried to
  connect to that IP using puTTY it gives me connection refused.

Please help.

A:

You can configure it with a static ip address, and assign your laptop a (different) static ip address. Here is a link to a guide to setting a static ip address.
