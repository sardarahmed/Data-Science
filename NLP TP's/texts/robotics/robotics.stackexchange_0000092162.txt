Q:

Not able to run ros2 node

I installed ros2(crystal) in the same machine having ros(melodic). I changed my .bashrc script also as shown below
source /opt/ros/crystal/setup.bash
source /home/deepan/ros2_install/ros2-crystal-20190408-linux-bionic-arm64/ros2-linux/setup.bash

But when  I try to start a ros2 node(ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker), I am getting the below error.

Does anyone faced the same issue? If so, please help me with this. Thank you.

A:

ros2-crystal-20190408-linux-bionic-arm64

and

OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error

is your system an ARM8 system in 64bit mode? What is the output of uname -a?
Also:

source /opt/ros/crystal/setup.bash

source /home/deepan/ros2_install/ros2-crystal-20190408-linux-bionic-arm64/ros2-linux/setup.bash

why are you mixing Debian packages with the Linux archives?

Edit:

My system is not arm.

obvious, but you should download the correct binaries for your architecture.

why are you mixing Debian packages with the Linux archives?

I just want to check this way. Anyway Iam using Debian Package only.
Can you please suggest me which one is better? either using debian package or linux archives?

If you're just starting, I'd install the Debian packages. They're automatically updated for you and your installation is managed by the system's package manager.
