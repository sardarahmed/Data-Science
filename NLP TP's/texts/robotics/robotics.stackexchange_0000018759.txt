Q:

Iterative calculation of trajectory

In the answer https://robotics.stackexchange.com/a/7512/22953 there is an example for trapetzoid trajectory planning that results in the following table.
\begin{array} {|r|r|}
\hline
time        & t & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9\\
\hline
acceleration& a & 0 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -2 & -2 & -2\\
velocity    & v & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 4 & 2 & 0\\
position    & d & 0 & 1 & 4 & 9 & 15 & 21 & 27 & 32 & 35 & 36\\
\hline
\end{array}
By ocular inspection it seems that 
v[t] = v[t - 1] + a[t]
d[t] = d[t - 1] + (v[t - 1] + v[t]) / 2

What is the mathematical basis for this? Why is the average velocity used but not the average accelation? What would the corresponding table look like for a third degree trajectory (i.e. constant jerk instead of constant acceleration)?

A:

Trapezoidal trajectory is basically a piecewise quadratic function. Since the function is quadratic, its second derivative is a constant. The trajectory is then basically comprises segments of constant accelerations.
Denoting a trajectory function as $x(t)$, for each segment we would have
$$
x''(t) = a(t) = a,
$$
where $a$ is the constant acceleration of that segment.
Integrating the above equation with respect to time, we would then have the velocity equation
$$
x'(t) = v(t) = at + v_0,
$$
where the constant of the integration is $v_0$, which is the initial velocity of that segment.
We finally obtain the displacement equation by integrating the above equation
$$
x(t) = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_0t + x_0,
$$
where the constant of the integration is $x_0$, which is the initial displacement of the segment.
If we substitute $at = v(t) - v_0$ (from the velocity equation) into the displacement equation, we would then have
$$
\begin{align}
x(t) &= \frac{1}{2}(v(t) - v_0)t + v_0t + x_0\\
&= \frac{1}{2}(v(t) + v_0)t + x_0.
\end{align}
$$
Now you can probably see how it comes to be the average of the velocities.
From the given table, you can view it as the trajectory being given as segments where each segment has duration of 1 second.

For a third degree (piecewise cubic) trajectory, the idea is pretty much the same. You start from the fact that the jerk for each segment is constant, i.e.
$$
x'''(t) = j(t) = j.
$$
Then all the remaining equations can be derived by integrating the above equation accordingly.
