Q:

Does anyone know where to get the old 1.X Openni versions?

Since openni.org has been shut down I'm not sure where to go.  I'm looking for whatever is the last stable one, 1.5.4 the last time I checked.

A:

The OpenNI sdk is on github...you could download the source for one of the releases.
If you're looking for older versions of NITE or the OpenNI sensor driver, I have access to some old copies of those. Feel free to send me an email and we can work something out.
EDIT
As of November, 2017 this site has legacy versions of most of the OpenNI packages.
