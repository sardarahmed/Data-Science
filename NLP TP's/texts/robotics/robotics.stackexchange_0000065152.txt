Q:

How long is support for ROS Hydro?

I am in doubt to use ROS Hydro for this year in my project at the university, once I dont know for how long the support will continue. I could move to Indigo, but with what I have already developed, it is easier to keep using Hydro.

A:

Hydro will officially be EOL'd when Jade comes out. It will keep working, it just won't get updates.
