Q:

Using navigation_stack with a fixed map and no amcl

Hello,
I have robot that uses the ekf node in the robot_localization package and a static map that I can load onto the map_server and I used a static tf publisher to publish frame info from odom to map. I would be able to provide the robot with its initial position (assuming the robot will always start from a fixed point on the map), so I don't need amcl. The problem is that when I send a goal pose to the robot, the path created will penetrate the obstacle areas in that map as shown the screenshot.

Does anybody have any idea how to use a static map with ekf only (no amcl)?
Thanks

A:

AMCL doesn't do any path planning so that isn't related to your issue.
Move_base calls path planners that use costmaps to do the planning so make sure your costmaps are set up properly which is covered in the navigation stack tutorials.

Yes my problem with the global costmap configuration not with the localization. Thank you.
