Q:

adding NaoQI to the PYTHONPATH

Hi,
I loaded the nao_robot and nao_common stacks and am trying to operate the driver, however, i am a newbie to ROS, and am unsure of how to add Aldebaran's NaoQI API to the PYTHONPATH.  Is this done in the setup.sh file, or by physically moving the directory.  Any help would be much appreciated!
Thanks,

Thanks for the Response Stefan!  It didn't quite work though, i got the following error. No handlers could be found for logger "rosout"
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1331912435.002598] Error importing NaoQI. Please make sure that Aldebaran's NaoQI API is in your PYTHONPATH.  Any ideas what else to try?

If you use NaoQI version 1.12, please refer to this answer: http://answers.ros.org/question/28902/adding-naoqi-api-to-pythonpath-v112?answer=29878#post-id-29878

A:

Add the lib subdirectory of Aldebaran's SDK to the PYTHONPATH environment variable by executing
export PYTHONPATH=/your/path/to/naoqi-sdk-1.10.52-linux/lib:${PYTHONPATH}
before you launch nodes from nao_robot. If you do not want to type this line every time, you can add this line to your ~/.profile file, which is executed automatically whenever you start a new shell.
Afterwards, you can launch the nao driver nodes with
NAO_IP=127.0.0.1 roslaunch nao_driver nao_driver.launch
(replace 127.0.0.1 by the IP of your robot).
