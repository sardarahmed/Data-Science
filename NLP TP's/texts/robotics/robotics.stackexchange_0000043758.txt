A:

The [map_name].yaml file only contains metadata about the map, which is given as a separate [map_name].pgm image file. You can create maps by using a SLAM algorithm and saving it using the map_saver tool. In principle, you can also edit maps by editing .pgm files with a graphics editing program of your choice.
Most relevant information can be found on the map_server wiki page.
How to generate maps with SLAM algorithms is described here (gmapping) and here (hector_mapping).

So I can use GIMP to make a map even? If I then go on to write the meta-data (.yaml) file myself?
What colors should I use for the map?
Thank you.
