Q:

RGBDSLAM black screen, not receving data, not building model

I have been trying to use RGBDSLAM to build a 3d model using a kinect sensor on a Turtlebot 2 running on Groovy and have so far been unable to get more than one image from the camera.
On the Turtlebot, I do: roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch and roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
I am running RGBDSLAM on my own workstation. When I start RGBDSLAM (using 'rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam'), the GUI starts correctly and shows a black screen with two blue and red axes. I think hit the space bar and nothing happens, nothing is updated, even when I move the Turtlebot around. When I look at the terminal output for RGBDSLAM, I see the following (and it doesn't change at all):
[user]@[machine]:~$ rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam
Initializing Node...
[ INFO] [1373404458.387233301]: Connected to roscore
[ INFO] [1373404459.920681061]: Publishing latched (single publish will take longer, all topics are prepared)
[ INFO] [1373404460.197975256]: Listening to /camera/rgb/image_rect_color and /camera/depth_registered/image_rect
[ INFO] [1373404464.410408126]: Pause toggled to: false

Which shows that RGBDSLAM is not processing any data. I've checked to make sure openni.launch is producing nodes that publish to /camera/rgb/image_rect_color and /camera/depth_registered/image_rect and rostopic echo /camera/rgb/image_rect_color prints out an infinite series of numbers, as expected. The only other warning I receive is from the terminal that launched openni, which says (repeatedly):

What could be wrong? Any help is greatly appreciated.

A:

If you don't see the 2d images (rgb/depth) in rgbdslam's gui, my guess is that the transmission over the network (is it wifi?) is the problem.
Have a look at this answer and this one.

Yes, it was the WiFi connection that was the problem. The link to the synchronization policy was most helpful, and I solved the problem by creating buffering nodes. Thanks a lot for the links in the right direction!

Hi, I started working on rgbd slam with TurtleBot, ros hydro Ubunto 12.04 I followed this link:http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/ to install rgbd slam, and after I had a GUI window as the window exactly in this link,

with the two posts below: waiting for visual picture on topic waiting for depth image is topic there is no picture,

i think it was a problem with topics in launch files can some one help me and send to me the launch of openni+rgbdslam.launch openni.launch rgbdslam.launch
