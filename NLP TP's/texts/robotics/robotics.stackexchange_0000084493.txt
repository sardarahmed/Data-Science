Hi @Franklin4080.
Please, be more specific: how did you generate the "vector_map"?
If you created the node that generates the "vector_map", did you remember to normalize it?

A:

I also recently ran into this exact same error message when trying to visualize a nav_msgs/Path topic with invalid (all zeros) quaternions in the path poses. Our code doesn't use the orientation portion of the pose and we had been able to visualize these paths with no problems before. I have version 1.12.14 of rviz and my colleague who had version 1.12.13 of rviz was able to visualize our paths.
TLDR: It seems like the latest version of rviz (1.12.14) is more strict about quaternions according to the changelog
