Q:

Error getting controller list

When I attempt to get the list of controllers from the controller_manager in Kinetic, I get an error:
> rosrun controller_manager controller_manager list
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/controller_manager/controller_manager", line 41, in <module>
    controller_manager_interface.list_controllers()
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/controller_manager/controller_manager_interface.py", line 60, in list_controllers
    print '%s - %s ( %s )'%(c.name, c.hardware_interface, c.state)
AttributeError: 'ControllerState' object has no attribute 'hardware_interface'

My knowledge of python is pretty shaky, but it looks like hardware_interface is not a member of c, but rather of c.claimed_resources. Anybody else seeing this error?

I found the same problem.  It looks like it's been fixed in this commit.
