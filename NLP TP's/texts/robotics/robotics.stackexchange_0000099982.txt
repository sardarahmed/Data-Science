A:

The problem are your line ending characters. Your file was created or edited on a Windows system and uses Windows/DOS-style line endings (CR+LF), whereas Linux systems like Ubuntu require Unix-style line endings (LF).
There is a simple tool that can convert the two different styles for you called dos2unix.
Install it by running
sudo apt install dos2unix

After that, you can convert files in either direction using one of the commands
dos2unix /PATH/TO/YOUR/WINDOWS_FILE
unix2dos /PATH/TO/YOUR/LINUX_FILE

Example:
dos2unix tf_list_conversion.py

Or use an editor which stores files in the target format.
