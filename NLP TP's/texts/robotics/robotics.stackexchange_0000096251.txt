Q:

Where is ros2doctor?

I am going through the tutorials on dashing distro. Up to this point (mostly) ok, but this is baffling. I am at the "Getting started with ros2doctor", but "doctor" or "wtf" do not exist as a ros2 command. It is not included in the command list from "ros2 -h" either (and neither is in the example output in earlier tutorial!). So why should it even be available? (ubuntu 18, binary version). Thanks!

A:

ros2doctor was released in eloquent and likely is not backported to dashing, the feature list for eloquent is here
