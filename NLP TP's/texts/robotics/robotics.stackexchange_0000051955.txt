Q:

Openni error: cannot connect to Kinect device

I recently installed Fuerte RGBDSLAM on Ubuntu 12.04, and I am having issues running openni.launch with my Kinect Xbox 360.
When I input the command "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch," the following errors appear:
...
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored
process[camera_base_link3-22]: started with pid [24264]
[ERROR] [1371132230.942545630]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/compressedDepth/set_parameters]
[ERROR] [1371132230.949755309]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/compressed/set_parameters]
[ERROR] [1371132230.957609969]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/theora/set_parameters]
[ INFO] [1371132233.084870097]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

I believe it was already answered that both the "Exception AttributeError" and the "[ERROR]...Tried to advertise..." messages are harmless, but I'm still having problems with the [INFO] error:
[ INFO] [1371132233.084870097]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

Any advice?

The info error is missing from your question.

please try with "lsusb". I should see something similar Bus 002 Device 019: ID 045e:02b0 Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Motor. Bear in mind that Ubuntu 12.04 has some problems with USB3.0, so plug the Kinect into a USB2.0 port.

A:

I had the same problem with my device. Don't worry about the errors. It's normal. I followed this answer:

If you have problems uninstalling some openni packages try to reinstall their dependencies and again uninstall them one-by-one
