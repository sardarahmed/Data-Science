Q:

3dsensor.launch doesn't work on hydro

Hey all,
I am trying to run 3dsensor.launch file on hydro without any success. the strange thing is that the follower demo which uses 3dsensor.launch file is working good. What can be the problem? How can I fix this?
Thanks in advance.

Sorry I am working with turtlebot-2. my problem was that when I run the 3dsensor.launch to activate the kinect I coudn't get a DepthCloud data. I found the reason. I changed the argument (in 3dsensor.launch file) "depth_registration" to be "false" and that worked. I couldnâ€™t see a "/scan" topic either.
I still have a question. What does the depth_registration parameter do?

A:

The issue is discussed here: http://answers.ros.org/question/112391/nothing-published-to-scan-under-hydro/ .
I've submitted an issue to the github repository here: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/issues/123
