Q:

Unable to contact my own server

Hello,
I have the following setup:

Ros indigo

-Laptop hosting a local wifi hotspot with IP 10.42.0.1. It is also
connected to the internet via
ethernet, but on a different network
interface, so different (and
unrelated IP).

-Youbot that has joined the created hotspot (These are the only two
things in that network). IP
10.42.0.20

-SSH 'd into the Youbot on the mentioned Laptop.

The .bashrc on the laptop has the
following lines in it:
 export ROS_IP=10.42.0.1
 export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.1:11311

The youbot sources the .bashrc on ssh
login and it also contains
 export  ROS_IP=10.42.0.1 
 export  ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.1:11311

What I can do:

ping in either direction (always
using the IP, never the hostname)
Netcat in either direction
Start roscore on the Laptop

What I cannot do:

Start the youbot driver on the
youbot. It always terminates with the
"Unable to contact my own server at
[http://10.42.0.1:35449/]" message. I feel like I've looked
at a lot of tutorials and don't see
what's wrong, but there obviously is
something wrong. Can anybody tell me
what please?

A:

Youbot that has joined the created hotspot (These are the only two
things in that network). IP 10.42.0.20

...

The youbot sources the .bashrc on ssh login and it also contains

export  ROS_IP=10.42.0.1  

If this is not a typo, then that is your problem. You state that the youbot is at 10.42.0.20, but you set its ROS_IP to 10.42.0.1. That cannot work.

Thanks, I thought ROS_IP was also supposed to be the IP that hosts roscore, but now that you mention it that doesn't really make sense!
