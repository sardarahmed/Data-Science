Q:

Battery system with and without mains voltage attached

I'm working on a project where mains voltage will sometimes be disconnected, and the system will have to run on battery for as long as possible before doing a (safe) shutdown.  The desired behavior is exactly like a laptop battery system:

When mains voltage is connected, charge the battery and power the system from mains
When mains voltage is disconnected, power the system from the battery
Prevent the battery system from supplying current when the batteries are discharged below a certain voltage (to prevent damage).

Is there a name for this type of system, or a name for the feature(s) that I should be looking for when I look at chargers?  (If it matters, this system will be 12V, so I'm looking at 14.8V Lithium battery options.)

A:

I found the name of the component: PMIC, or Power Management IC.
To quote from this example: 

PMICs seamlessly manage power flow from various power sources (wall adapters, USB and batteries) to power loads (device systems and the charging battery), while maintaining current limits where required (such as that specified for USB). To this end, PMICs typically feature built-in PowerPath control, DC/DC conversion and battery charging functions.
