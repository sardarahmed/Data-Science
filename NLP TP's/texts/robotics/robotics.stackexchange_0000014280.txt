Q:

Standard deviation calculation for a single measurement

I have a robot that takes a measurement of its current pose in the form
$$
z
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
x\\
y\\
\theta
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$x$ and $y$ are the coordinates in $XY$ plane et $\theta$ the heading angle.
I also have ground truth poses 
$$
z_{gt}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{gt}\\
y_{gt}\\
\theta_{gt}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
I want to estimate the standard deviation of the measurement.
As the standard deviation formula is:
$\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{i=N}(x_{i}-\mu)^2}$
Is it correct to calculate in this case where I have only one measurement, i.e 
$N=1$:
$\sigma_{xx}=\sqrt{(x-x_{gt})^2}$ 
and the same for $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{\theta\theta}$ ?
Edit
The measurement is taken from a place recognition algorithm where for a query image, a best match from a database of images is returned. To each image in the database is associated a pose where this image has been taken, i.e $z_{gt}$. That's why I only have one measurement. In order to integrate it into the correction step of Kalman filter, I want a model of measurement standard deviation to estimate the covariance having the following form:
$$
\Sigma
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x}^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \sigma_{y}^2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \sigma_{\theta }^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

A:

In short; no, you can't estimate standard deviation from a single measurement. Your last equation, assuming $\mu = x_{gt}$ is invalid because you have no guarantee that the mean measurement will match the ground truth (the sensor could have bias error).
The first formula you give is used only if you sample the entire population of possible values, which means the distribution would have to be discrete. I'm guessing in your case the distribution includes all real numbers (a continuous distribution) so the best you can do is estimate the real standard deviation via the sample distribution. In this case the formula you want is:
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \left ( x_i - \bar{x} \right )^2}{N-1}}$$
where as $N \rightarrow \infty, s \rightarrow \sigma ^{(a)}$. Since the denominator is zero for $N=1$ the sample distribution would be undefined.
You can approximate it in a few ways. Most common is to take many measurements and apply the sample standard deviation formula. Another rough option is to look for accuracy specs from the vendor and assume that full range means 6 standard deviations (e.g. $\pm 1$cm -> range of 2cm -> $\sigma = \frac{2}{6}$cm). This is further assuming a normal distribution and the accuracy spec covers 99% of all values.
$^{a}$This isn't exactly true, even for the unbiased estimate I gave, but it's close enough to true to be the most commonly used form
