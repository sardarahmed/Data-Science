Q:

Hokuyo_node tutorial error

Hi,
I followed the exact steps on http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node/Tutorials/UsingTheHokuyoNode
Everything showed up as expected until I reached the final step, which is
rosrun rviz rviz -d rospack find hokuyo_node/hokuyo_test.vcg
I got an error:
ERROR: the config file '/opt/ros/indigo/share/hokuyo_node/hokuyo_test.vcg' is a .vcg file, which is the old rviz config format.
New config files have a .rviz extension and use YAML formatting.  The format changed
between Fuerte and Groovy.  There is not (yet) an automated conversion program.
I tried to change the command to rosrun rviz rviz -d rospack find hokuyo_node/hokuyo_test.rviz, rviz did launch, but I just could not change the fixed frame to '/laser' in the global options, the fixed frame is 'map' when rviz launched.
Can anyone please give me some advice?
Thanks.
Steven

Hi, Steven. I'm on the same boat as you are! Did you get the solution? Regards.

A:

Run rviz without the .vcg file i.e. rosrun rviz rviz. Set Global Options -> Fixed frame = /laser and Grid -> Reference Frame = /laser. The Add -> LaserScan, and set it's topic to /scan. You should see the laser scan on the grid.

Just to elaborate on this: the Fixed Frame field is also a text entry field; you may have to manually type in '/laser'

Thanks! Got the data successfully shown on the rviz!
