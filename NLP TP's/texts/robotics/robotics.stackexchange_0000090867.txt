Q:

Gazebo doesn't start (but RViz does)

Hello,
I'm quite new to ROS. I started out with the following robot: https://github.com/epfl-lasa/kuka-lwr-ros I got everything running (so far at least). But there is still an issue, namely RViz starts but Gazebo doesn't. The readme of the kuka-lwr-ros states: "If the Gazebo window does not open this is because a flag is set in the sim.launch file." but I really can't find this flag. The sim.launch looks like follows:
<include file="$(find lwr_launch)/launch/simulation.launch">
        <arg name="rviz_config"       value="$(find lwr_simple_example)/launch/rviz/rviz_config.rviz"/>
    <arg name="t1_limits"         value="false"/>
</include>

I'd really appreciate your help. Thanks in advance!

A:

In ROS, launch files can include other launch files.  The sim.launch file you gave here is doing that with the <include file=...> tag.  If you go to the file specified there (simulation.launch), you'll see the Gazebo flag you're looking for.
The README probably gave the wrong file to look in because the launch files have been refactored since then.
