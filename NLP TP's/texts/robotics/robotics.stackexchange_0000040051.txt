Q:

rosdep install -a fails on Debian Sqeeze

Hi all,
Following the guide at http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Debian , I get to step 1.5 without issue (as far as I can tell) but when I run rosdep install -a, I get the following:
magus:~/ros-underlay/build# rosdep install -a

I can see that yaml-cpp-sourcedep is not installed and it appears that eigen3 might not be either, but I am not sure where these are supposed to come from.

Comment by Cody on 2012-04-30:
This looks potentially similar to my issue on gentoo (but I don't get any output except the mass of "No definition" errors). http://answers.ros.org/question/32872/ros-fuerte-install-on-gentoo-fails-at-rosdep

A:

I simply went on with the install, installing packages as needed when compilation failed.  rosdep doesn't have files in Fuerte yet for the debian squeeze packages.  I had an Electric install before this one so I just assumed that I had some of these packages.  In the short future, I'll probably file a bug which includes a reasonable rosdep.yaml file.
Some of the ones here are obvious, but pcl and flann I had to compile from the sources.  They are available at https://github.com/wg-debs - you clone the repository you need and then you can install the build dependencies for the package.
For each of the two (I installed flann first, because it was needed for pcl):

git clone https://github.com/wg-debs/flann.git
Remove "unneeded" dependencies from debian/control Build-Dependencies (the ones that start with ros- are the only ones I removed)
dpkg-source --commit (to commit the "extra files" that are there)
git-buildpackage -us -uc --git-ignore-new
dpkg -i ../*.deb

There were other small hurdles as well, but they are less of an issue than these two libraries which are custom installed.
