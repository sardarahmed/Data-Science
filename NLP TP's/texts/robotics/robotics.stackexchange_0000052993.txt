Q:

How to find the number of Markers in a Marker Array?

Hi Everyone,
I'm trying to write a simple program that extracts the heights from all the markers in a MarkerArray message. However, I am having a lot of trouble doing this.
This is how I get the cartesian information:
msg->markers[i].pose.position.z
I read somewhere that this might work, but so far no luck:
msg->markers.size()
Any ideas?

A:

msg->markers.size() gives you the number of markers contained in the message.
To find or set the height, have a look at the scale fields of the marker message (see also http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker#Message_Parameters).
