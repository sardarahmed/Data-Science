Q:

how to work with ros time

Hi,
I have saved some gps data using the gps fix message type. In this message, the gps data has a field called %time.
Except, this %time data is kind of weird. The format the %time values are in is of the following:
1355859745049430000
1355859746522960000
1355859747052170000
...
How do I convert this time data to something that I can work with, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, etc.
Thanks for the help.

A:

I don't see any ROS functions for doing this, but here's an algorithm in PHP that you could use: http://www.andrews.edu/~tzs/timeconv/timealgorithm.html

Hmm, this is talking about gps time. I looked into my data a bit more, and I found that: -this time data is actually rostime and not gps time, so basically I capture this gps data using play [rosbag_file_name] and then I just listen to my gps topic. So this time data is the same time data as rosbag

So, how would I convert this rosbag time to something in seconds that makes sense? Once again, this rosbag time looks like this: 1355885782739630000, 1355885782763280000, and my loop rate is at 50 hz or 0.02 seconds

The time field of the GPSFix message is supposed to be GPS time... how is that field getting filled? The ROS time should be in GPSFix.header.stamp
