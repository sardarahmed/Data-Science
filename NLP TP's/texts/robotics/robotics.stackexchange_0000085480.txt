Q:

Copy a ROS Installation between two systems

Hey there, I am working with ROS Kinetic right now. I build ROS on a ARM based unit.
Is it possibly to "copy" my current ros installation, as is and move it to another ARM board?
Is there a  list of all folders ROS installs in?
Whtat is the preferd way to target this?
Thanks

It really depends on how you've installed ROS.

Can you eleborate on that? I install ros from the repository. The main folder is installed in the opt directory. But I dont know where to look up all additional installation folders apart from opt

A:

This might not be what you're looking for, but usually when I do that I just copy the whole system using Clonezilla.
