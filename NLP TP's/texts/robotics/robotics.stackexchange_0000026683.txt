Q:

Problem with SDF files or robot_description parameter

So I am working my way through some of the tutorials for ROS/Gazebo. I am running into some issues with the ROS Control with Gazebo Tutorial however. In particular when I launch the robot_control package, I get an error saying
Could not find parameter robot_description on parameter server

After a little digging I added the following to my launch file:
<param name="robot_description" textfile="path/to/robot.sdf"/>

to set the robot_description parameter. However after I did that I get the error:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/robot_state_publisher/robot_state_publisher
[ERROR] [1376891403.184690567]: Could not find the 'robot' element in the xml file
[ERROR] [1376891403.184756779]: Could not generate robot model
[ERROR] [1376891403.184774430]: Failed to extract kdl tree from xml robot description

So I am guessing that what is happening is that robot_state_publisher is looking for a URDF file while I am providing a SDF file. How do I get around this?
Thanks in advance.

Hi munnveed,
I had the same problem. If you want to use RVIZ with gazebo, you definetly need an urdf-description of your robot. My workaroud was, to have both, an URDF model for the robot_description, and an SDF model for the visualization.
But this was very difficult to maintain, since all changes had to be done in both models. In the meanwhile, I took the time to setup an URDF model and extended this with  elements as evilBiber already explained. Gazebo is able to convert it on loading, but i has to be without mistakes, otherwise the parser will fail.
