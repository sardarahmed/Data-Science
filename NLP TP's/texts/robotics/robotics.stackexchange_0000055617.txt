Q:

Where's repository of debbuild scripts?

Needless to say, http://www.ros.org/debbuild/$ROS_DISTRO$.html (eg. hydro) pages are quite useful for release fans!
I just can't find its repository and issue trackers. Where is it?

In concrete for debbuild web site, I stopped being able to show the search result by reloading the page with the search query left in the textfield; the page used to show the search result after reloading. Maybe these few days, it shows blank search result area.

A:

The scripts you're asking about can be found here: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm/tree/master/scripts
Note there's a newer version at https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm/tree/master/scripts/status
