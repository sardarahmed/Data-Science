Q:

Is oculus quest2 available for autoware

Hi
I am handling Oculus Quest2 to visualize the camera or Rviz scene to the device.
I found some oculus supporting UIs in the runtime manager and found relevant documents.
https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/-/tree/2f18aae2976e350eb4c3b2c320a9ff07b8bca3d9/ui/oculus/ofw
Has anyone tried something similar like this approach?
Thanks.

I'm sorry but the Oculus Quest is not officially supported by Autoware.ai.
