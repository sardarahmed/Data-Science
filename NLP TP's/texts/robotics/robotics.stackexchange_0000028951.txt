Q:

Loading a sdf file in gazebo

I am loading a sdf file. But when loading it gives a following error
[Wrn] [ModelDatabase.cc:340] Getting models from[http://gazebosim.org/models/]. This may take a few seconds

what I know is this problem is occuring may be due to meshes I'm adding.

A:

In the uri i was using model://[path of the mesh] so it was searching in ~/.gazebo/models in which i don't have these meshes is it was prompting thus error. I changed the uri to path of the mesh and it worked perfectly
