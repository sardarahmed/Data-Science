Q:

rqt_reconfigure window is totally empty

Hi,
rqt_reconfigure looks working badly on my computer. It shows a totally empty window. It is showing no parameter, no grid, and no command window. Nothing. 
I was trying to reconfigure the parameter of the pointgray camera. Cutting off Auto exposure and Turn on the Trigger.
I tried troubleshooting in the rqt_reconfigure wiki but it seems there is no problem. There are some return by hitting
"$ rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam list".
Below is a screenshot of troubleshooting(left) and rqt_reconfigure window(right).
Does anyone have a solution to this?
Thank you in advance.

Please provide more information. What OS are you using? How did you install ROS? See the support guide.

Thank you for your comment Geoff. The problem is solved.
When I right click at the empty window, the option appeared. (Forgot to screenshot and never appear again). After that, a small "dynamic reconfigure" button appeared. All windows came up with pushing the button.
