Q:

How to configure a roslaunch xml to run a node that specifies a path?

I'm trying to run
rosrun ORB_SLAM2 RGBD PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE

within a .launch file and I don't know how to specify the path
I tried something like the following but it didn't run.
<node pkg= "ORB_SLAM2" type= "RGBD" args= "<path1> <path2>">

My example:
<launch>
    <include file="/home/mesa/catkin_ws/src/mavros/mavros/launch/px4.launch"/>
    <include file="/opt/ros/kinetic/share/freenect_launch/launch/freenect.launch"/> 
    <node pkg= "ORB_SLAM2" type= "RGBD" args= "/home/mesa/cavedrone/ORB_SLAM2/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt /home/mesa/cavedrone/ORB_SLAM2/tcp_rgbd/bin/kinect.yaml" >

</launch>

The error I get
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag: line 6, column 2

Something like that should work. Please edit your question to include the exact launch file and the error message that you get when you try to run it.

Okay, updated

A:

The error tells you the problem
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag: line 6, column 2

Take a look at your node tag, it's missing the / at the end. Change it to
<node pkg= "ORB_SLAM2" type= "RGBD" args= "/home/mesa/cavedrone/ORB_SLAM2/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt /home/mesa/cavedrone/ORB_SLAM2/tcp_rgbd/bin/kinect.yaml" />

Note how I added the / at the end of the node tag.

Thank you! Also as a note for others I needed to add a name so I had something like name = "foo" into the line for the launch file to run.
