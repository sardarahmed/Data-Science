Q:

Which version of wxWidgets used in ROS?

I found that when I install Code::Blocks to try to write wxWidgets, it shows a window to let me choose version of wxWidgets.
  1. 2.6.x
  
  2. 2.8.x

  3. 2.9.x (SVN Version)

Which version used by ROS?

What's difference between them? Is higher version compatible with lower version?

Thank you~

A:

ROS uses the version of wx bundled with your system.  It appears to be 2.8 in most distributions.
