Q:

qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "windows" in ""

ROS 2 tutorial, Introducing turtlesim and rqt, instructs us to execute the following commands in two cmd windows (I am exercising on Windows 10 platform), ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node and ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key. Both commands fails with the error message:
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "windows" in ""
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Does this mean that I need to install Qt? If yes, why isn't Qt included in Foxy release, or, as part of install instruction? Could you provide the pointer where I can download free version of Qt? Once I install Qt, what  else do I need to do so that the turtlesim will work successfully? Thanks a lot for the help.
My foxy installation was successful. At the end of the installation, both ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker and ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener worked. I am just started with the ros2 tutorial. The command set | findstr ROS produced the following:
ROS_DISTRO=foxy
ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_VERSION=2

I have the same issue I would like help getting this going. I also cant run rqt without getting plugin.xml non found errors

I have the exact same issue.

Found a fix:
In Windows 10 set environment variable QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH and point it to where PyQT5 DLL's were installed to, in my case
C:\Python38\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\Qt\plugins\platforms

This hasn't helped me, Can someone please help? Also I noticed that is says turtlesim is only available for Dashing onward? I'm using Foxy, is this going to hinder my ability to use turtlesim?

Same here with staticoli, this fix doesnt work for me and seems to be the only fix on the internet. If anyone has a new fix please share it

A:

I run into the same problem. In my case (Foxy on Windows 10), the solution was to set the variable QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH to C:\dev\ros2_foxy\bin\platforms,  the path to qwindows.dll delivered by ROS2. It was confusing since there is another qwindows.dll file under C:\Python38\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\Qt\plugins\platforms as described by @Izsyvj.

This worked like a charm. Thank You :) I also set that up in the Power Shell profile settings such that I don't have to do it every time I open a new shell.

Worked for me as well. Wish the ROS team would add this in their tutorial.

I tried it and it works for me too. Thank you!
It's really necessary to add this solution in ROS2 tutorial
Comment by Dorthyn on 2021-04-13:
It also worked for me!(rolling version on Windows 10). Just like what you said, it is weird that a qwindows.dll is also in PyQt5\Qt\plugins\platforms

I don't have \PyQt5 folder inside the \Lib\site-packages. Should i install PyQt5 with pip?

This also worked for me!
