Q:

ROS2/create_subscription: How to pass callback arguments

In ROS 1, I was able to pass arguments to the callback function of a subscriber:
rospy.Subscriber(topic_name, type, call_back, call_back_arg)
How can I do this in ROS2?
My goal is to pass the name of the topic. Because I have a single call back for many topics and when the callback is invoked, I need to know what topic called it. It there a better way to find this?
Thank you

A:

One of the ROS2 developers, "Ivan Santiago Paunovic", answered this question as following:
You can easily solve this using a lambda:
node.create_subscription(std_msgs.msg.String, "my_topic", lambda msg: common_callback(msg, other_args), 10)
