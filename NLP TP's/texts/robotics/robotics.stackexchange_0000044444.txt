Q:

Suggestions on using irobot create with hokuyo urg 04lx / turtlebot?

I was wondering if its possible to use hokuyo URG 04LX lidar sensor with the turtlebot or irobot create.The kinect has a limited range of 50 degrees scan. I want to use the hokuyo for larger scans (180-240 degrees).  How do we use the same turtlebot power and sensor board to connect the hokuyo laser? I have seen that people have successfully used arduino with roomba and hokuyo, but has anyone being able to use create / turtlebot successfully and build 2d maps.

A:

Sure, that should work fine. The only thing, you need to do is use 5V instead of the 12V for Kinect.
