Q:

64-bit Win-ros sdk?

Can anyone supply me with information on when the win-ros sdk for 64-bit might be coming out? We've got some software we need to compile into ros nodes in 64-bit, only on Windows.

A:

"A very long time" is the only safe answer to this. The very, very first step of genuine Windows support (the new catkin build system) will ship with Groovy. Getting the great majority of the code working will happen...someday!
