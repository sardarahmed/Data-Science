May I know, is Soar already in the ROS repository? Could you please share with us the link, thanks in advance.

Here is the link: http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/downloads
Soar supports Linux 9.3.2 (both 64-bit and 32-bit)

A:

It is not currently packaged. If you or anyone else would like help packaging it for distribution as a ROS package let me know and we can help you. There is documentation of the process here: http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/ReleaseThirdParty
