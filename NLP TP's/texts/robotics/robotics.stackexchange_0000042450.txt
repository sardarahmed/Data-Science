Q:

Error thrown from publisher.h header file

We're trying to communicate via publisher/subscriber nodes between a laptop and a PC-104, but whenever we try to send a message, this error is returned:
QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for on_button_move_to_clicked(int)
[ INFO] [1342642126.367633583]: DOUT clicked. Data: 15.
[ INFO] [1342642126.367836194]: SLOT invoked.
[FATAL] [1342642126.367895559]: ASSERTION FAILED
file = /opt/ros/fuerte/include/ros/publisher.h
line = 102
cond = false
message =
[FATAL] [1342642126.367953248]: Call to publish() on an invalid Publisher
[FATAL] [1342642126.367994664]:
Trace/breakpoint trap
Which is generated by this line in publisher.h:
  if (!impl_)
     {
       ROS_ASSERT_MSG(false, "Call to publish() on an invalid Publisher");
       return;
     }

But we're not sure what "!impl_" means, so we can't figure out what exactly is triggering this error. Has anyone dealt with this before?

A:

To me it looks like you are trying to call publish on an uninitialized publisher object. Make sure that you initialize it by calling NodeHandle::advertise before you are trying to publish anything. Btw., you can check if a publisher is valid by:
if( !publisher ) {
  ROS_WARN("Publisher invalid!");
}
