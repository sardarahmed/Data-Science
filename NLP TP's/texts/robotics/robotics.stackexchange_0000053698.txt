Q:

When following the tf tutorial,there are errors here:
After typing "roslaunch turtle_tf_broadcaster start_demo.launch",
it returns
"ERROR: cannot launch node of type [learning_tf/turtle_tf_broadcaster]: can't locate node [turtle_tf_broadcaster] in package [learning_tf]"

A:

I built with catkin and had the same problem. I solved it by executing the command "source devel/setup.sh" in the catkin workplace before running the launch file.
(I always forget to run it....)
