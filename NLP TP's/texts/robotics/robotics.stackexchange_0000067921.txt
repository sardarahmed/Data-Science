Q:

install ros on debian wheezy

Hello!
I am trying to install ROS indigo on a Beaglebone Black with debian wheezy. I have followed the tutorial and it worked until the step 1.3. The commands sudo apt-get install python-setuptools and sudo easy_install pip were ok but when I execute sudo pip install -U rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall then I get the following message:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip-7.0.3-py2.7.egg/pip/_vendor/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:90: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more information, see https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning.

Could it be that this is only a warning not related to your problem?

Anyway wheezy is oldstable, so I'd recommend update to jessie.
