Q:

Need help getting tutorial working: Using urdf with robot_state_publisher

In the Using urdf with robot_state_publisher tutorial, it says:

Run rviz, choosing odom as your fixed frame. Add a Robot Model and TF.

and I got stuck there.  I ran:

rosrun rviz rviz

but not sure how to do any of the other steps mentioned above. Anyone know how to make this work?

A:

In RViz, choose "Add Display" and and add a TF and RobotModel display. Where it says "Global Options", set the fixed frame to "odom".
See http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/UserGuide
