Q:

PR2 Fuerte repository

Looks like some of the repository links to PR2 code are pointing to old versions. For example, pr2_mechanism_controllers are pointing to SVN with a version different from the one which is described in API section for Fuerte (compare function publishTransform() from SVN and API Reference)
This gives a lot of problems when compiling from source, especially when code is pulled by roslocate as it returns wrong addresses for stacks.
So, there are two questions:

Where can I find the right PR2 code for Fuerte? (e.g. pr2_mechanism_controllers)
Where should I report such problems in future?

Thanks

A:

The latest version is available in trunk: https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_controllers/trunk/
I suggest pulling down the entire stack rather than individual packages.
If you're on Ubuntu, you can install the ros-fuerte-pr2-controllers deb package instead.
Future meta-issues like this should probably be reported on the pr2-users mailing list: http://lists.willowgarage.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pr2-users

Thanks. I used roslocate which pulled entire stack, but of a wrong version. I am on Fedora, so have to build everything from sources.
