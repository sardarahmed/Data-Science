Are you using a wireless connection?
Comment by smkybear15 on 2013-03-09:
Yes I am using a wireless connection and I am working on a 2008 mac book pro running unbuntu 12.10
Comment by tonybaltovski on 2013-03-09:
I believe the wireless is suppose to be wlan0.  Are you able to connect to the wireless now?
Comment by smkybear15 on 2013-03-09:
My computer says I'm connected though a wireless network I reconnected to it and I got the same thing  and no wlan0

Please edit you post with the output of ifconfig. If only one has an inetaddr that one is probably your IP.
Comment by smkybear15 on 2013-03-09:
Both eth1 and lo have inetaddr would lo be the robot the computer says it's a local loop back link
Comment by dornhege on 2013-03-09:
No, lo is local, i.e. no outside connection. It's probably eth1 then.
Comment by smkybear15 on 2013-03-09:
The local connection would make since because the turtlebot is plugged into this computer
Comment by dornhege on 2013-03-09:
Wait, you're doing everything from one machine? Then you probably don't need to do anything and it will just work. If you are doing networking, the lo interface is NOT the place to look for the IP as it is local.

Hey, try these commands in your terminal...sudo service network-manager restart. And then type ifconfig to check wlan0 is reflected ? Post output of everything here please ??

Given the sparse information, I think eth1 is his wireless. iwconfig should clear that up.
