Q:

ROS package for Ibeo Lux?

I am trying to integrate an Ibeo Lux LIDAR, but I can not find a ROS package that handles this sensor. Does anybody know whether there is a ready-to-use ROS package available, or anything that is (close to being) compatible?

hi @danzda do you have any news or luck with the sick_ldmrs package?
Comment by danzda on 2017-02-09:
No, I managed to get it working on my pc but wouldn't connect to the LiDAR

A:

The Sick LD-MRS is a re-badged Ibeo Lux, so the sick_ldmrs package might be able to talk to a Lux. Looks like it hasn't been touched since Electric, but might still be useful to you.
