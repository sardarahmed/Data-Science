Q:

Why am I getting NO_PUBKEY F42ED6FBAB17C654?

I have been trying to follow the procedure at https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html but am getting

Err:6
http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu
focal InRelease
The following signatures couldn't be
verified because the public key is not
available: NO_PUBKEY F42ED6FBAB17C654

Why is this happening and is there a way I can fix it? I am running Ubuntu MATE' 20.04 on my laptop.

A:

Did you set up your sources?
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html#setup-sources
Especially, the ROS 2 GPG key with apt and the repository added to your sources list.
Debian packages for ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill are currently available for Ubuntu Jammy (Ubuntu 22.04). You are running Ubuntu MATE 20.04. Maybe this is the problem here?
You can build it from source (check code tab with "Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"):
