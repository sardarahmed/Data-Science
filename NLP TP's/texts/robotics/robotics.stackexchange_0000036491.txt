Q:

rxplot is not plotting as desired

I have been trying to use  rxplot. I have a topic called  pose3D_LD defined somewhere in my code and the related fields are as below:
        pose3D_LD.position.x = utmRight_x;
        pose3D_LD.position.y = utmHigh_y;
        pose3D_LD.position.z = data_set[t][5]; 

        pose3D_LD.orientation.x = q.x();
        pose3D_LD.orientation.y = q.y();
        pose3D_LD.orientation.z = q.z();
        pose3D_LD.orientation.w = q.w();

However, when I issue a command, say, rxplot /pose3D_LD/position.x, it returns an error saying that plotting topics /pose3D_LD/position.x
Invalid topic spec [/pose3D_LD/position.x]: 'Pose' object has no attribute 'position.x'. Can someone check the command I call, whether it is valid or not? I guess, the topic and field is set correctly, but I'm not sure if the dot operator is allowed or not upon calling that command.

A:

Very sorry to answer this myself, I just found the hint here.
Dot operator is not allowed, instead, we need to use slash(/).
