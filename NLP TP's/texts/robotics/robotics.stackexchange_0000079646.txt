Q:

When to use the move_groupinterface and GetMotionPlan service

I am aware of the implementation of motion planning in moveit using the move_group_interface
If I have a simple pose goal, I can use the moveit_ros/planning_interface/move_group_interface to do the planning.
However, I can do the same using the GetMotionPlan service from moveit_msgs.
My question is, when should I use what? What could be the advantages and disadvantages of each method?

A:

The MoveGroupInterface class is a convenience wrapper for a lot of the ROS interfaces exposed by the move_group node, including GetMotionPlan.
It builds and calls these services for you, so that you don't have to fill in all the parameters yourself.
If you feel more comfortable using the bare service, you can use them too.
Considering readability of the resulting source code MoveGroupInterface is usually better in my experience.
