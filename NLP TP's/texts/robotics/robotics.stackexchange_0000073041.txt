Q:

ros indigo installation error on raspberry pi 2

I'm following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi. In part 4.3 while Building the catkin Workspace i get this error
Linking CXX shared library /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/collada_parser/lib/libcollada_parser.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcollada-dom2.4-dp
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
CMakeFiles/collada_parser.dir/build.make:125: recipe for target '/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/collada_parser/lib/libcollada_parser.so' failed

make: *** [all] Error 2
<== Failed to process package 'collada_parser':
  Command '['/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh', 'make', '-j2']' returned non-zero exit status 2

i followed the path and didn't find libcollada_parser.so so wht am i missing and how to overcome that problem ?
i'm new to ROS and just getting started
Thanks in advance

Could you please post how you installed the missing files. Im having the same error and i havent been able to find a solution anywhere.

A:

I found the error, some files my mate didn't install, so i had to format  and restart the whole process and now it's working just fine

It's not 'wrong', but we typically don't do that here on ROS Answers. It's not a forum.
