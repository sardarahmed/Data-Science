Q:

offline documentation

The ROS documentation servers were down this morning (Nov 17, 2011) from about 10:00 am to 1:30 pm EST (at least from Pittsburgh). Is there any way to access documentation pages offline? Maybe a debian documentation package or simply a tarball? I am a pretty heavy ROS user and Google cache pages take a while to load sometimes.

A:

There is a wiki mirror maintained by Felix Endres at Freiburg: http://ros.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/roswiki/
And Felix documented how he does it in this question.
