Q:

Building only ROS messages or services

Is there a way to only build ROS message or services without building the entire package?  I sometimes want to separate the building of the entire package and just the messages to more concisely determine if I have an issue.
Thanks!

A:

Normally, people just create a package that does not contain anything but messages to split up the dependency tree and to not force the user to compile source code if she just wants messages. You can find many examples for this in ROS, for instance nav_msgs, geometry_msgs, std_msgs, etc.

+1 A separate message and service package is a best-practice that almost everyone should follow.
