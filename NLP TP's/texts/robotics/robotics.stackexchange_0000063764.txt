Q:

How to switch between ROS Hydro and ROS Indigo Version on Ubuntu 12.04?

I have installed both ROS Hydro and ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 12.04. I want to know how to switch between these versions when I am compiling a catkin workspace in Ubuntu.  I have two catkin workspaces, one of them works with ROS Hydro and the other works with ROS Indigo. So, if I want to do a catkin build of the catkin workspace based on ROS Indigo, then what should I do?
Thanks

A:

In a new terminal you need to run
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

That will set your current terminal to use Indigo. Be careful that you don't source any other Hydro setup.bash files in your ~/.bashrc file or you might start overlaying packages, which is probably not what you want to do.
To switch back to Hydro, you need to open a new terminal and run
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash

Sourcing a different setup file does not affect previously configured workspaces. You need to wipe the build/devel folder and rebuild the workspace with the different environment.

@ish45 says that he has two separate workspaces, one for each distro. Should he still need to wipe the build/devel folders?

Sorry, I missed that part. No, then it is not necessary.
