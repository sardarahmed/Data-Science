Q:

hector indoor SLAM demo: rviz crashes

rviz crashes when I try to run the hector quadrotor indoor SLAM demo (plus another bunch of warnings show up). Gazebo however starts. I tried it on groovy. One of the relevant problems is that the configuration file for rviz is in the old format (.vcg), whereas it expects a YAML (.rviz) file.
How do I solve this? Shall I convert the file? How do I do it?
$ roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo indoor_slam_gazebo.launch 
[...]
process[rviz-10]: started with pid [1591]
ERROR: the config file '/home/kr1zz/workspace/rosbuild_ws/hector_quadrotor_tutorial/hector_quadrotor_apps/hector_quadrotor_demo/rviz_cfg/indoor_slam.vcg' is a .vcg file, which is the old rviz config format.
       New config files have a .rviz extension and use YAML formatting.  The format changed
       between Fuerte and Groovy.  There is not (yet) an automated conversion program.

(I trimmed the rest of the output but I can post if required)

A:

maybe the rviz config file format is not right

hector_quadrotor_demo/rviz_cfg/indoor_slam.vcg' is a .vcg file, which is the old rviz config format

i am using indigo distro for me its .rviz format maybe you should try converting the file from .vcg format to .rviz format
