Q:

OS X Installation Error

I am attempting to install ROS on OS X Lion. I've used ROS a lot in Linux but would like to be able to run ros distributed onto a Mac. I am getting stuck on step 1.6 with a "python-svn could not be imported" error. I have already attempted to install python-svn using pip, homebrew as well as an independent package I found online. Not sure what to do.
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=electric&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no"
Traceback (most recent call last):

Thanks!

A:

Actually we moved back from pysvn as the dependencies seem to cause problems and due to licensing issues. So after an update of rosinstall and vcstools, this should be fine again.
Note that easy_install does not update vcstools if you just tell it to update rosinstall. use pip or tell easy_install to also update vcstools.
