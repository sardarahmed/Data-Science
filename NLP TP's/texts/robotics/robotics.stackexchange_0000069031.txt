Q:

Visualizing bag files using d3.js

I wonder if there is any previous work for visualizing bag files using d3.js. I know I can convert them to csv but even in that case they differ somewhat from the normal csv files. Any hint is really appreciated.

A:

You could publish the contents of the bag using rosbridge:
http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite
And then use roslibjs to interface it with d3.js:

If you want the data in a different flat format, you could use the rosbag API C++/Python to access the bag and then write it out to something else:

Hi @William can you please provide more details like the commands I should run in terminal? I am new to ROS and find this answer very high-level for me. Is there also a similar work of visualizing bag files using d3.js you can link me to? I've been googling but it was unsuccessful

I don't have time to walk you through it, but I'd recommend following the tutorials for rosbridge and/or roslibjs. I'm not aware of any out-of-the-box integration between d3.js and ROS. You're going to have to do some legwork and figure out what has already been done and what still needs to be done.
