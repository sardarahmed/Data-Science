Q:

gmapping output very large 4000X4000?

hi,
We just ran Pioneer with ROS navigation stack with slam_gmapping node.
The output of the map is 4000x4000 (appx. 15 MB) irrespective of size of environment explored.
If I try to use this map for sbpl_lattice_planner, it just waits for the map. I can visualize map in rviz. The map is grey (may be to refer to unknown area). But rviz & system hangs.
Is this behaviour because of big size of map??
I can not find which parameters to use to set map bounds? Any  ideas?
Update 1: I tested it one other laptop. I may be because of hardware problem , not able to handle Rviz! is it possible with i5 processor?

A:

Have a look at the parameter section of the gmapping documentation.
You can set the parameters xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax to some small values (like 5 meters or so). You can also adjust the resolution by setting delta.
Here is an example for an launch file with the values set. (10m x 10m map, 2cm resolution)
