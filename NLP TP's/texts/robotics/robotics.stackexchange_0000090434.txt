Q:

How to get turtlebot to move in gazebo?

Hi, I am brand new to ROS and have had issues setting up my turtlebot_gazebo to just have the simulated turtlebot move around.
I am just trying to follow this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo/Tutorials/indigo/Make%20a%20map%20and%20navigate%20with%20it
But get stuck on Step 2, which is really just getting this http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/hydro/Explore%20the%20Gazebo%20world to work.
I run
roscore
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch

Which both work fine.
Then I do
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

However, while my key presses to move the robot appear in the keyboard_teleop.launch terminal window, the robot doesn't move in Rviz.
How do I get my robot to listen to the turtlebot_telop_keyboard/cmd_vel topic if my robot only exists in simulation? Which node is the actual turtlebot?
Do I need to have
roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch

be running? Because that gives me an error (Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/amcl.launch.xml').

Hi, To figure out why the robot does not move, make sure that you are publishing on the correct topic.
so start with rostopic list and check if keyboard_teleop publishes on the correct topic. could you tell  which version of ros you are using indigo or kinetic?

Thank you for your prompt response! When I run
rosnode info /turtlebot_teleop_keyboard

I get
Node [/turtlebot_teleop_keyboard]
Publications:

/cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop [geometry_msgs/Twist]
/rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

So it looks right
I am running Ubuntu 15.10 and my ROS is Kinetic.

Delb's solution actually has it moving now. Thank you anyways though

A:

There seems to be a bug in the script responsible to set the speed of the robot because you do have the topic /mobile_base/commands/velocitypublishing data (this is the topic that moves the robot) but this data is always only 0 eventhough you press some keys and the script prints different speeds. So you can either investigate the script turtlebot_teleop_key or instead you can use another launch file that is working fine that use the mobile_base of the turtlebot directly (i.e. kobuki).
Try:
roslaunch kobuki_keyop keyop.launch

That worked! Thank you so much.

Glad it worked, have you modified the script or just used the kobuki_keyop package ?
Comment by ahumay on 2019-02-12:
Just the kobuki_keyop package, which is odd because I swore I tried it before. Obviously not though
