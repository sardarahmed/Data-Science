A:

Hit:1 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal InRelease

you appear to be running Ubuntu Focal (ie: 20.04).
ROS 2 Dashing is not supported on Focal.
See also Installing ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy (which is supported on Focal) and Installing ROS 2 Dashing Diademata which states the supported OS version: Ubuntu Bionic (or 18.04).
And the page you link (Installing ROS 2 via Debian Packages) has this right after the TOC:

Debian packages for ROS 2 Dashing Diademata are available for Ubuntu Bionic.

Finally: REP 2000: ROS 2 Releases and Target Platforms also lists supported OS for Dashing.

bash: /usr/share/gazebo-9/setup.sh: No such file or directory
root@ubuntu:/home/duttonide# source ~/ros2learn/environments/gym-gazebo2/provision/mara_setup.sh
bash: /usr/share/gazebo-9/setup.sh: No such file or directory

I'm not sure what those errors mean.
I would suggest you mark this question as answered (by clicking on the checkmark to the left of the answer), and then post a new question for your new problems.

Also: I would advise you to not log into your system as root.
That's very much discouraged.
