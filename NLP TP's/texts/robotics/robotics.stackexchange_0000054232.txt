Q:

ros-hydro-pocketsphinx permission problem

Hi community,
current ros-hydro-pocketsphinx package cannot be launched or executed,
because of incorrect permissions of the python node scripts.
Setting the execute permission for python nodes is a workaround.
Who can fix it for the future ?
Cheers
Christian

I've created a ticket for this here: https://github.com/mikeferguson/pocketsphinx/issues/5
I should be able to get a patch + new release out over the weekend.
