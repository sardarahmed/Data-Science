Q:

install turtlesim

I install groovy on ArchLinux (ARM7) on Odroid-X.
And I haven't (for example) turlesim (and more packages).
How to install the packages?

A:

You should install yaourt (or packer). Then, you would simply have to type (for instance):
yaourt --noconfirm ros-groovy-turtlesim

Not all the packages are available in AUR (this is a lengthy process and there are few maintainers), but the most important ones are. You can see the list of available Groovy packages here.
As @Ruslan pointed out, all the instructions are available here. By using AUR packages, you will be sure that no conflict happens when installing packages, and dependencies will be automatically checked/installed. This is not necessarily the case if you are installing from source on your own. Also, when installing from source, you will probably end up with Python2/Python3 conflicts that are automatically fixed in AUR packages.
If you encounter a problem with one of the packages, leave a message on the adequate AUR package page and/or contact the maintainer.
