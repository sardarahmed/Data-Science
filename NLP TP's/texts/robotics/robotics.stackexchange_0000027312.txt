Q:

Fixed-wing UAV simulation?

Are there any models of fixed-wing UAVs? I'd like to be able to simulate one and control it through ROS. This video seems promising, but I can't seem to locate anything else about it.

Maybe asking in the gazebo mailing list is a good option for your question.

A:

I think this is world file, and this is the plugin.
This is very experimental, and just a proof of concept. I haven't seen other fixed wing models in Gazebo, but that doesn't mean someone has one floating around out there.
