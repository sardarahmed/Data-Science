You need to save the html code to a file, like "ros_test.html".  Then open that file in your browser.  You should see "Simple roslib Example.  Check your Web Console for output".    To see the console (in the Chrome browser):   menu/more tools/javascript console.  Other browsers will be similar.

oh "Received message on /listener: Hello wold" is written there thank you :)  so the code is ok but how can i write it to a label?

You need to save the html code to a file, like ros_test.html. Then open that file in your browser. You should see Simple roslib Example. Check your Web Console for output. To see the console (in the Chrome browser): menu, more tools, javascript console. Other browsers will have something similar.
To have the HTML update:
In the body section, add something with an Id:
  <body>
  <h1>Simple roslib Example</h1>
  <p id="abc">Test</p>
</body>

In listener.subscribe(function(message), add
document.getElementById("abc").innerHTML = message.data;
