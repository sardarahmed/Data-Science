Q:

writing a custom message and using it in a different package

first of all, I have gone through these links, so it is not a repeat question:

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/DefiningCustomMessages
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Creating_a_msg
http://answers.ros.org/question/31779/how-to-use-a-message-that-i-made/
http://answers.ros.org/question/62092/catkin_make-started-failing-to-generate-h-from-msg/
http://answers.ros.org/question/52744/how-to-specify-dependencies-with-foo_msgs-catkin-packages/
http://answers.ros.org/question/62707/jenkins-fails-to-build-with-no-such-file-or-directory/

and i tried all of these solutions, but they did not help me.
The question is..
I have created a msg folder in package 'A'. wrote hello.msg in that 'msg' folder. I followed this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv#Creating_a_msg and catkin_make worked fine here.
I now created a new package 'B' , has a node 'helpme.cpp' and in that I have written #include "A/hello.h"
and I defined
A::hello left,right;
left.myheight = image.rows;
left.mywidth = image.cols;

.....in the callback function
and when I do catkin_make, it says..
/home/krish/architecture_ws/src/rectifier/src/camera_timestamp_node.cpp:276:6: error: ‘const ImageConstPtr’ has no member named ‘mywidth’
/home/krish/architecture_ws/src/rectifier/src/camera_timestamp_node.cpp:277:6: error: ‘const ImageConstPtr’ has no member named ‘myheight’

pls tell me what changes should I make in CMakeLists.txt and package.xml in the packages A and B.

Could you please reformat this, I just over read your message definition. The readability is quite horrible.
Like use the code (0101010) Button for your message definition.

I've fixed your formatting a bit, because as @cyborg-x1 writes, it was unintelligible before. Please take care of formatting your question properly in the future: it increases your chances of getting answers.

ok, gvdhoorn and cybord-x1, I will take care of formatting from next time

A:

I got this problem because of my programming mistake.
I have given the same variable name to both ImageConstPtr and my own message type.
the problem is solved now
thanks gvdhoorn and cyborg-x1
