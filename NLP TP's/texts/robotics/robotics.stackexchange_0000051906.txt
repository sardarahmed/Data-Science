Q:

What python version does Catkin require?

I have a non-debian OS (QNX 6.5) where default Python version is 2.5. What version of python is required to get catkin run (meanwhile I try to upgrade the python's version and port catkin for it)?

A:

catkin requires python 2.7, which is the minimum version set out in REP 3:

It might work with python 2.6, but I couldn't promise this.

Has it been tested with Python 3.2 or 3.3?
Comment by William on 2013-06-12:
It is not regularly tested on Python 3.2 or 3.3. Parts are tested (catkin_pkg) regularly: https://travis-ci.org/ros-infrastructure/catkin_pkg catkin_pkg is known to be failing on 3.3
