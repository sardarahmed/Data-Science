Q:

Why cannot I rosmake the image_pipeline package?

Hi,
I want to use the opencv in my ros, following the tutorials: http: // www .ros.org/wiki/openni_launch, I git cloned the image_view package(actually I use the command:     git clone https :// github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline.git, because image_pipeline includes image_view), however, I can not rosmake the package, it always shows like:
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...                                                 
[ rosmake ] No package specified.  Building stack ['image_pipeline']            
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['image_pipeline']                          
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory /home/turtlebot/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20130408-221329
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['image_pipeline'] to:
[]

[ rosmake ] WARNING: The stack "camera_calibration" was not found. We will assume it is using the new buildsystem and try to continue...

anybody knows how to deal with it? thanks!

You should try turning off capslock.

A:

The default branch (groovy-devel) of image_pipeline uses the new buildsystem, catkin, so you need to use catkin to build it, instead of rosbuild.
