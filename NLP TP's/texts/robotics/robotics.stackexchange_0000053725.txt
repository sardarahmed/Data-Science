Q:

Custom Messages Won't Build

I am using rosmake and fuerte.
rosbuild_genmsg is uncommented in the CMakeLists.txt.
Running rosmake in the package doesn't create a msg_gen folder or the messages. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong....
No Make file in package my_msgs

In a later project which uses the messages:
fatal error: my_msgs/MyMsg.h

A:

I forgot that you needed the custom Makefile in ROS:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/Makefile for more information (why is there's no cpp version, i dunno)
More specifically, your Makefile needs to be:
include $(shell rospack find mk)/cmake.mk
