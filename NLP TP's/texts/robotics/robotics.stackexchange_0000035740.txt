It's not clear what you want to know. Are you asking what you need to publish if you write a new camera driver? Are you asking what existing drivers publish?

A:

Based on the camera drivers wiki page and the first few lines of the image pipeline wiki page, you should publish raw (distorted) images, or the closest thing your camera's API can provide. A user would almost certainly pass these to various parts of image_pipeline to get undistorted, debayered, etc. images for their particular application.
