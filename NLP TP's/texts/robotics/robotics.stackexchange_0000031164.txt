Q:

diamondback stereo_image_proc and GPU

The wg-ros-pkg in cturtle has a sandbox directory with stereo_image_proc_gpu. This same package is not present in diamondback's wg-ros-pkg. Where did it go? Did it advance out of the sandbox, or did it get cut completely? Are the GPU-ready packages in diamondback gathered in some centralized area, or is there perhaps a list of them?
Thanks,
Sean

A:

Sean-
Victor from OpenCV and I set up that package for benchmarking. If you look at the code, that package uses a modified version of stereo image proc that runs on the GPU with CUDA. That package was never designed to be released.
I believe OpenCV has released GPU implementations of several algorithms, including stereo block matching (or they may be scheduled to release them soon). I don't think these algorithms have been integrated with ROS's stereo_image_proc, but you could probably patch it fairly easily since they probably have identical API's. If you create any patches, open a ticket in ros-pkg.

Does anyone know if this is currently being worked on by someone?
