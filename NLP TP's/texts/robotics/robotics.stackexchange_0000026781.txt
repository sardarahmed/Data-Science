Q:

Robot exploding when touching other objects

Hi everyone!
I am having problems with my simulation. When my robot tries to move over an object (in this case the parking block) it suddenly explodes (see picture) 
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks in advance
EDIT: I am using Gazebo version 1.8.6.
EDIT: I also have a Plugin, where I set the angular and linear velocity of the model.
sdf file: model2.sdf

Can you please post your robot's SDF file, and also indicate what version of Gazebo you're using?

I'll also need the DAE files please.

A:

Make sure that your collision objects, inertial parameters, and joints are all correct.
