Q:

installing ROS from source, actionlib error

I'm trying to install ROS from source. First problem that I ran into is that the git repo for actionlib does not exists any more.
Exception caught during install: Error processing 'actionlib' : [actionlib] Checkout of git://github.com/wg-debs/actionlib-release.git version debian/ros-fuerte-actionlib_1.8.6_lucid into /home/gloin/ros-underlay/actionlib failed.

Does anybody know for some other repo for actionlib or how to continue with instalation process.
Thank you.

A:

Actionlib is now at https://github.com/ros-gbp/actionlib-release.git. To find the release repositories, you can have a look at the distro yaml files in the rosdistro repo. For fuerte, check out this file.

How do we submit a ticket for this? I asked on the user mailing list, but no answers yet. Not sure where to submit a ticket to ... it isn't an actionlib issue, but an install issue.

Bump.

Hm. Good question. Maybe on the rosdistro github page? https://github.com/ros/rosdistro
