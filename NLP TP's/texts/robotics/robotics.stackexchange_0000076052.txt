Q:

md5sum change when modifying comments in msg/srv/action?

When only updating comments in .msg/.srv/.action file, does checksum get changed?
Locally I tested as follows and md5 doesn't seem to change.
Here's from DEB:
$ rospack find moveit_msgs
/opt/ros/indigo/share/moveit_msgs
$ rossrv md5 ExecuteKnownTrajectory
[moveit_msgs/ExecuteKnownTrajectory]: e30b86cbd13304832e894dc994795e33
$ rosversion moveit_msgs
0.7.4
$ dpkg -p ros-indigo-moveit-msgs|grep Ver
Version: 0.7.4-0trusty-20160822-230048-0700

Then I modified comment only in ExecuteKnownTrajectory.srv (using this PR):
$ cd src/ros-planning/moveit_msgs
$ git log
commit 2807deaf572d19793e825c39453fc7337d68e749

    Add comment in ExecuteKnownTrajectory service to prioritize newly added ExecuteTrajectory action.
:
$ catkin build moveit_msgs
$ source install/setup.bash
$ rospack find moveit_msgs
/home/rosnoodle/indigo_trusty/cws_planning/install/share/moveit_msgs
$ rossrv md5 ExecuteKnownTrajectory
[moveit_msgs/ExecuteKnownTrajectory]: e30b86cbd13304832e894dc994795e33

md5sum seems to be the same.
IMO comment is the best place for description of those files so I hope the answer to be false.

I'm confused: you are actually asking for confirmation whether the comment is not used when calculating the MD5 sum, correct?
Comment by 130s on 2016-08-30:
@gvdhoorn Yes, that's correct. And I escalated one of your comments as an answer :)

A:

According to wiki/ROS - Technical Overview - Message serialization and msg MD5 sums comments should not be part of the MD5 text.
