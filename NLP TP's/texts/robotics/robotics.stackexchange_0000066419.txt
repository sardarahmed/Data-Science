Q:

Inverse of geometry_msgs/pose

What's the best way to find the inverse of a geometry_msgs/Pose message?
Or in general to perform any other matrix manipulations. Does ROS provide a library or functions to do so? And if not, which is the default method used by the ROS community?

A:

If with "inverse of pose" you mean something that deals with transforms and their inverses, then you're probably looking for the tf system in ROS.
If you're just starting with this, tf2 might actually be better, as it is the successor to tf.
See the various tutorials for more info on how to use both.

The "pose" in my case represents a child coordinate frame (frame B) in parent coordinates (frame A). I want to find out the inverse of that (A in coordinates of B).

Pose and Transform are equivalent. And it makes sense to avoid tf when needing the inverse of a pose sometimes.
