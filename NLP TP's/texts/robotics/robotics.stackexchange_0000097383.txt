Q:

rosout and stderr not appearing in ROS_LOG_DIR

I changed the ROS_LOG_DIR from the default and now I am only seeing node specific stdout.log files in the generated folders. I know my nodes are generating stderr messages with ROS_ERROR_STREAM but I don't see any ERROR messages in the log or a rosout.log file.
Is there an additional setting I need to set for the rosout.log file and error logs to go to the ROS_LOG_DIR ?

A:

It appears that rosout.log is written by roscore and not each node as I had originally believed. I had roscore running in a separate location that did not have write permissions to that folder which is why rosout.log was not being generated. After resolving this, the log appears as normal.
