Q:

Installing ROS for using with NAO

Hi everybody,

Which packages do I need to install to work with Nao Robot?! 
I followed these 2 links from ROS Wiki, and I am really confused now :(  :

/nao/Tutorials/Getting-Started
/nao/Installation/remote

The purpose of my project is that I need to detect some shapes and those colors to move them...

Kind Regards,
Nima

A:

First of all, you need to make sure you are using a supported operating system.  Typically if you're using Ubuntu you'll be fine.  The other systems are experimental and I cannot speak to how well they work (someone else want to chip in about that?)  http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
You then have to install a version of ROS.  My suggestion would be Hydro (newest) or Groovy(second newest). http://wiki.ros.org/hydro http://wiki.ros.org/groovy
I would read the first two things listed in the tutorials here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials  They should give you a little more background.
Edit: I forgot to add in this! http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/StartGuide I found reading the Start Guide immensely helpful because you really get a better understanding for how the structure behind this all works.
Once you're comfortable, then you can start looking into getting the Nao packages.
Edit2: http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Nao
One thing you'll learn about here is that no one will bother to teach you about something that you can easily find on the help pages.  I would ask more specific questions about specific roadblocks you encounter once you're more familiar with ROS.
Best of luck!

That sounds like an awesome project.  Just a heads up, ROS has a steep learning curve and you usually need to troubleshoot so I wouldn't assume you can just simply download everything and have it working perfectly right away.  If you're familiar with Linux already it will be easier though.

I really don know what to say with these great support & answers here, Thank you a lot, before I came here, I was really hopeless working with ROS but now, I am ready to go ahead with that ... ;)
