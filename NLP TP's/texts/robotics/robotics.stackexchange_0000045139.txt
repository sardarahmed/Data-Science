Q:

ROS newbie and questions about adding to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

I am new to ROS (and Unix environments) and am trying to go through some of the tutorials. I realize this is probably a basic question.
I'm currently reading through this tutorial and am running in to a snag.
(I have already already added the stack sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-dynamixel-motor)
In the first step, the tutorial states that my current directory is on the ROS path. (I am currently using a turtlebot) I have attempted to add this path to the directory
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/turtlebot/ros/ros-pkg ...
Then, when running this command
roscreate-pkg dynamixel_tutorials dynamixel_controllers
I receive this error:
ERROR: dependency [dynamixel_controllers] cannot be found
Any ideas?
I'm very confused.

A:

Managing ROS_PACKAGE_PATH manually is not recommended. It just leads to a messed up environment to easily. Instead, you should follow the install page and the tutorials and use rosws to set up an overlay. Have a look at this page and this tutorial.
