It looks like you don't have PyQt5 installed. If you provide some details about what your operating system is, which version of ROS you're using and how you installed ROS, someone can probably provide appropriate instructions for installing it.

I have installed the Kinetic Kame version of ROS in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and i installed ROS according to the instructions in the tutorials.

Another newbie here. I just installed ros melodic following installation instructions on virgin ubuntu 18.04 LTS system. Only previous stuff that might be related is installation of CUDA and cuDNN.
I get the same error when trying to view a rosbag with rqt_bag. No space here to show results.

A:

If you installed from apt by following http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu , then the QT5 python modules should have been installed automatically.
You can try to reinstall the python qt5 packages manually by running:
sudo apt-get install libpyside2-dev libshiboken2-dev pyqt5-dev python-pyqt5 python-pyqt5.qtsvg python-pyside2 python-sip-dev shiboken2
