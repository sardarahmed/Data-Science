Q:

My model always fly up and fall down to the ground

The moment I add my models to the world, they fly up to the sky and fall down to the ground. There is no force added to my models, however, it does fly up. Is there any parameter wrong of my models? What should I do to solve this problem?

A:

Maybe your models collide with the ground plane when they're spawned. Consider to add a Z offset in its pose and try if that solves the problem.
