Q:

roscore is not working and cant install pip or rospkg?

I has frute then I remove it and I downloaded hydro. I followed the steps until I reached to this step:
sudo rosdep init

I got the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/usr/bin/rosdep", line 3, in <module>
from rosdep2.main import rosdep_main
File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/rosdep2/__init__.py", line 40, in <module>

File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/rosdep2/installers.py", line 35, in <module>
from rospkg.os_detect import OsDetect
ImportError: No module named rospkg.os_detect

Then I looked for a solution and I did the following:
pip install -U rospkg

I got the following error :
Downloading/unpacking rospkg

Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement rospkg

 log_fp = open(filename, mode)

Also I tried:
sudo pip install --upgrade pip

and I got the following error:
