Q:

How can I use the iksolver.cpp

I generated the file to calculate the inverseKinematics with IKFast.
How can I use this file, to solve the IK from a cpp in ROS?
I can not find anything about that.
I'm using the solver TranslationDirection5D

I tried to compile the cpp anyway, to test it. And when I run it, it shows an error.
Usage: ./ik r00 r01 r02 t0 r10 r11 r12 t1 r20 r21 r22 t2 free0 ...
input: ./compute2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
output: Failed to get ik solution

A:

The orientation never can be "0 0 0" in all the cases.
The correct input should be (for example): ./compute2 1 0 0 0.1 0 1 0 0.2 0 0 1 0.3
And you can use the generated iksolver.cpp, using it like a normal include.
Respect to the use, there is a great example:
ikfastdemo.cpp: https://github.com/davetcoleman/clam/blob/master/clam_ik/src/ikfastdemo.cpp
There you can find many ways to use the solver (IK, FK...)
