Q:

What is producing the Wheel Frames?

So I am trying to work out how to wire up my custom robots wheels?
I fired up my turtlebot and via rosrun tf view_frames ( I have to be running roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch)
Frame wheel_left_link exists with parent base_link.
Frame wheel_right_link exists with parent base_link.

However my custom robot has no such frames and I am trying to work out what creates these frames.
My Custom frame is running Hector_slam and a Navigation stack
Exception thrown:"odom" passed to lookupTransform argument source_frame does not exist. 
The current list of frames is:
Frame base_frame exists with parent map.
Frame scanmatcher_frame exists with parent map.
Frame laser exists with parent base_frame.

I am just trying to work out whats going on
