Q:

Two Subscriptions synchronization

I'm subscribing to two cameras (as stereo system) with different FPS using one node.
How can I make sure that after few minutes, I'm taking the same images of the world with the two cameras like there is no delay with the two taken images ?

A:

You can use the ExactTime and ApproximateTime Synchronization methods in ROS.

In the answer at the link below, there is a sample code that subscribes to two point clouds and uses ApproximateTime policy for synchronization.

This answer was also pretty helpful for me: http://answers.ros.org/question/60903/timesynchronizer-callback-problem/. Shows code showing how to synchronize pretty well.
