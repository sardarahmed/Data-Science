Q:

error with tf and laser_scan

I build a navigation stack for my robot. When I roslaunch the launch file, the screen shows "error: couldn't transform from laser to base_footprint, even though the message notifier is in use". After a while, it said "error: couldn't determine robot's pose associated with laser scan". The screen images are shown below. Is there anyone know what's wrong with tf or laser_scan? Thanks very much.

@bvbdort, thanks. The problem is solved. I publish the transform from base_link to odom twice which caused the error.
