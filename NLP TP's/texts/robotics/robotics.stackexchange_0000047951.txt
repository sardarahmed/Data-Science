Q:

ROS msg get seqence number || pointer adress allways added

Hi I have a problem with ROS and messages especially.
void recievedGoals_callback(const boost::shared_ptr<nav_msgs::Path const>& msg)
      {
               std::cerr << "header seq   " << msg->header.seq << std::cerr;
       }

The return of this is something like "header seq   150x6297a8" and not the sequence-number i published (15)
Why? - Why is a pointer-adress added? How can I get rid of this adress?
The subscriber is:
ros::Subscriber sub_PathToGoal = n.subscribe<nav_msgs::Path>("/Exp/Goal", 1, boost::bind(recievedGoals_callback, _1), ros::VoidConstPtr(),ros::TransportHints().tcpNoDelay());

Thanks

A:

You are outputting std::cerr as the last value. That is the pointer variable being added.
I guess you want std::endl instead.
