Q:

How to get the force applied to a link?

Hello everyone,
I trying to control a quadrotor in gazebo but I'm having some trouble. I'm able to control the velocity of each rotors using a PID+SetForce(), but the quadrotor doens't take off. So, I want to monitor the resulting force applied to the base link of the quadrotor to find the problem, if it doens't fly because I didnt apply a control yet or because the rotors are rotating without applying any force to the body of the quadrotor.
How can I get the resulting force applied to the base link?

Take a look at Link::RelativeForce and Link::WorldForce

What does Link::RelativeForce return? Does it include forces on the link from downstream links? I'm not seeing that it does.
I'm trying to create a Force/Torque sensor that gives me the external force/torque on a link at the end of a chain.  I'd rather not put a joint there because joints must be between links that have mass in gazebo.
