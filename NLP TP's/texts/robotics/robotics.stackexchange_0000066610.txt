Q:

installation of gazebo turtlebot simulator

Hi all, I apologise in advance I'm totally new to this. I'm trying to install turtlebot with gazebo simulator.
I followed the instructions here:
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo/Tutorials/indigo/Explore%20the%20Gazebo%20world
I typed
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps ros-indigo-turtlebot-rviz-launchers

into the terminal but received  these errors.
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot-rviz-launchers

How do I get the packages? Thanks a lot in advance.
