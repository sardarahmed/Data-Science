Q:

IK controlling library for Schunk 7-DOF manipulator

Hi all,
since i have initialized my Schunk 7-DOF arm, i would like to ask , is there any inverse kinematics library to control this manipulator?
PS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS/FUERTE
Thanks!

Hi there, I'm just starting to work with 2 Schunk 7-DOF arms. Which library did you end up using?

Hello, I am working with a similar arm. I am having trouble with connecting MoveIt! to the COB software. Did you have issues there?

A:

See the http://wiki.ros.org/care-o-bot stack

Do you mean the stack cob_manipulation? I also find ikfast from OpenRAVE and KDL solver on the internet. Can I use either of them to do inverse kinematics controlling? Sorry for this simple question, i'm a beginner.

I don't have experience with that stack. Download and test it to find it out :)
