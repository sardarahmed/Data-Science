Q:

eband_local_planner configuration

Hello !
I try to use the elastic band planner in order to do navigation for an omni-directional robot.
My question is: How to configure the eband_local_planner for omni-directional or holonomic navigation ?
I don't find any specific parameter for this planner on the following website: http://wiki.ros.org/eband_local_planner 
I tried to use base_local_planner parameters but using EBandPlannerROS instead of TrajectoryPlannerROS but it doesn't works (nothing changes).
If this planner is configurable, how to do this ?
If anyone can help me (or just giving me the list of parameters for the eband_local_planner), I will be grateful,
lfr

Please open a github issue about the lack of documentation.

It's done.

A:

Ok, we can find most of the parameters here: eband_trajectory_controller.cpp - "initialize" function
Moreover the documentation for the eband_local_planner parameters on the ROS website is under construction.
Thanks to all,
lfr
