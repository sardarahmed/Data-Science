Q:

How can i get x y z coordinates of pointcloud from a point (x,y) of color image D435

Hi all,
I'm using object detection on color image and i have a point (x,y), it is center bounding box of object.
From this point, I want to get x y z coordinates of this point from pointcloud.
I have used this function to get data:  point_cloud2.read_points(data,field_names=('x', 'y', 'z'),skip_nans=True,uvs=[(x,y)])
But shape of pointcloud data is 160x120 while shape of color image is 640x480.
How can I get more data from pointcloud to shape is 640x480.
Thank you all!

Respected Sir,
I am working on Ubunto 20.4 with ROS noetic. I am having intel Real sense D415 camera by which I can visualize the point cloud on Rviz.
I want to get xyz coordinates of each pointcloud and from that I want to separate and print min and max point xyz coordinates.

I am very much new to ROS and doesn't have good programming experience as well. I will be very much thankful if anyone can share me any sample code or guide me step by step as i have searched almost all ROS forums but didn't get my answer.
I also asked a ques can you plz help me out
