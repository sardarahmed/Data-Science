Q:

Does `lockstep` argument only affect sensor plugin?

Gazebo offers an option, --lockstep to update sensor readings using  the exactly upate_rate defined by sensor plugin description.  Does other kinds of plugins, such as world or model plugin, can be affected by this option?
I think  it can. Because these plugins also define theOnUpdate method, which in my opinion it is affected by the upate_rate parameter.

A:

A plugin may or may not use the update event. A plugin could, for example, spin up a thread and perform asynchronous operations. You'll have to look at each plugin that you're using to see if it use the update event.

Thank for your answer!  So you mean that if a plugin has the update event, it will be affected by --lockstep argument?

Yes, the lockstep will control when Gazebo takes a simulation step, which in turn affects when events are triggered.
