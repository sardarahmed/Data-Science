Q:

Reducing the publishing rate of a topic from RosLaunch

Hi there,
I have a custom-built robot which I am trying to control with move_it. I have written the urdf and generated the srdf using the move_it setup assistant.
All the topics from my URDF are being broadcast on tf links at 30Hz based on a sensor_msgs/JointState  node I wrote. I am trying to link the base of my robot to the vicon /world coodinate frame (I am using the vicon_bridge package ). For some reason, I find that the frames being broadcast by vicon are crazily high (to the order of 200 - 400Hz) and as a result, move_it is not updating the tf transforms because of errors such as the following:

My tf view_frames is given by the attachment in the link http://tinypic.com/r/23uwtmo/9 . Is there a way to specify the publish limit to a nodefrom within a roslaunch file?

A:

You can use throttle from the topictools. This is a node that subscribes to a topic and republishes at a defined rate. You can use remap to make your vicon node to publish e.g. at /tf_superfast and let the throttle subscribe to this and republish on /tf.
