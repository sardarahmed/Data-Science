Q:

What do the 'quiet' and 'all topics' checkboxes in rxgraph do?

The most that the wiki page says about these is:

Removed in ROS 1.1
The -q and -t options were removed
from the command-line and replaced
with check boxes in the toolbar.

What exactly do they actually do?

A:

The quiet option removes the following nodes:
['/diag_agg', '/runtime_logger', '/pr2_dashboard', '/rviz', 
'/rosout', '/cpu_monitor', '/monitor','/hd_monitor', '/rxloggerlevel', '/clock']

Usually, the graph displays Nodes as, well, nodes, and the topics that connect them as edges.
If you use the topics mode, the graphs and the topics will both be nodes.

Thanks. Not sure why it's called "all topics" rather than "show topics as vertices" or even "boxes around topics". Since turning it on usually causes dot to come up with a totally new layout it isn't obvious what effect that option has.
