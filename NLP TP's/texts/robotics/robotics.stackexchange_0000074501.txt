Q:

Building ROS on raspberry PI3

Hello everyone.
I have followed the guide for building ROS on a rasberry and everything went fine. The only issue is that when i run catkin_make I encounter the following error:
Base path: /home/pi/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/pi/catkin_ws/src

I am running raspbian jessie on a brand new raspberry pi 3. Does anyone knows what is happening?
If i run
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/indigo

the isolated build works but it takes ages. Is there a way to make the classic catkin_make work?
Thank you in advance,
Andrea

A:

To speed up compilation, create a 515MB or 1GB swap file or partition on the RPi3. It helps a lot.

Allright but I am looking on some forum and adding swap is not recomended as stated here: link text. Is that true? Moreover, there is some solution to the error I have after catkin make?
Comment by spmaniato on 2016-06-14:\

You can use dphys-swapfile, as recommended in the link you posted. It will help with compilation time. 2) I've never built the core ROS packages from source using catkin_make. I think they may have to be built in isolation (but I'm not as familiar with this)

Ok, thank you very much! I built the ros environment using catkin build instead and everything is fine now I guess. Still struggling in building mavros from source
