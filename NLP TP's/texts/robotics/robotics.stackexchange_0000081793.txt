Q:

Navigation Stack transform base_link to /map error

Hi, I am trying to run a turtlebot 2 with and RPLidar. I launch the RPLidar node and the turtlebot bring up followed by the move_base from the tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup).
Currently I am running into this error: [ WARN] [1500061606.588011960]: Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: . canTransform returned after 0.101218 timeout was 0.1.
I also don't think my tf_tree looks correct: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-2f_ZBhV2PKVkhCZW1vaVY3em8/view?usp=sharing
Even after reading the tf wiki page, I am having trouble understanding how to configure it and integrate tf into my project. There is no "map" transformation, and there are two separate trees...
Any help would be appreciated!

Whatever mobile_base_nodelet_manager is, looks like you configure it to use base_footprint as frame while you should have used base_link. An alternative solution would be to provide a static transform from base_link to base_footprint.

A:

It seems you are not running AMCL. This node localizes the robot in a previously built map, and provide the map->odom transform, which is missing in your tree.
