Q:

Ubuntu 18 some kinetic packages not found in melodic

Hi, I am trying to install a number of packages which were present in kinetic:
$ apt-get install ros-melodic-joy ros-melodic-teleop-twist-joy ros-melodic-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-melodic-laser-proc ros-melodic-rgbd-launch ros-melodic-depthimage-to-laserscan ros-melodic-rosserial-arduino ros-melodic-rosserial-python ros-melodic-rosserial-server ros-melodic-rosserial-client ros-melodic-rosserial-msgs ros-melodic-amcl ros-melodic-map-server ros-melodic-move-base ros-melodic-urdf ros-melodic-xacro ros-melodic-compressed-image-transport ros-melodic-rqt-image-view ros-melodic-gmapping ros-melodic-navigation ros-melodic-interactive-markers
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-teleop-twist-joy
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-depthimage-to-laserscan
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-rosserial-arduino
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-rosserial-python
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-rosserial-server
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-rosserial-client
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-rosserial-msgs
E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-gmapping

But as seen, some of their melodic counterparts can not be found. If these are available anyway, then where can I find the new packages names? I did apt update as suggested here.

A:

Those packages appear to not have been released yet into Melodic.
You can use status_page/compare_kinetic_melodic.html to check.
For teleop_twist_joy for instance: status_page/compare_kinetic_melodic.html?q=teleop_twist:

Notice how there is no version number in the Melodic column.
You can also check the wiki page of each package. Again for teleop_twist_joy:

Notice how there is no version button for melodic.

Edit: if you still wish to use those packages, you could attempt a source build. That is more involved then installing using apt-get though.
See #q252478 for an example workflow.
