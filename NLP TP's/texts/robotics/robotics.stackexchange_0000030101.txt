Q:

Removing the "dear xxx" part of ros answers?

Hello,
Is there a way to make the askbot stop using the header starting with "Dear xxx, somebody has answered...".
This is useless information: I know my name and the question being tackled is already in the email title. This also prevent getting useful information in the gmail email preview.
Additionally, I personally find the header extremely irritating, like a middle-man telling me that somebody has said something, when I can hear the something.
The bottom line, is that I would want ros answers to behave as nicely and unobtrusively as the ros-users mailing list.
Thanks for your help.

The link to unsubscribe must be there - by law :)! but the wording could be better.

"Please note - you can easily change how often you receive these notifications or unsubscribe. Thank you for your interest in our forum!" is also pretty annoying. You might want to open a ticket on the ROS Trac.

A:

Please suggest something better, will be glad to make a reasonable change in askbot. Thanks.

I believe the suggestion is to simply remove this header and footer completely.
