Q:

Simulating multi-wheel vehicles in Gazebo

Hi!
I'm quite new with Gazebo and URDF. I followed the tutorials provided by the wiki, but I still have some questions. My objective is to model a vehicle in Gazebo with an arbitrary number of wheels, which have 2 degrees of freedom (translation and rotation). I know how to do that part using URDF. However, I don't know how I can control those wheels independently. I want to have a ROS node where I can set the translation speed and the orientation angle of each wheel independently. Is that possible? Can anybody give me a hint about it?
Thanks in advance!

A:

As suggested by David, writing a ros plugin similar to diffdrive plugin used in erratic model is probably the easiest way.
Alternatively, if for some reason you are familiar with the pr2 mechanism stack and wanted to use the pr2 controllers stack, you can see the single_link.launch example in pr2_examples_gazebo package as a starting point.
