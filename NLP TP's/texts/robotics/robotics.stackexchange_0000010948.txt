Q:

Appropriate control scheme for gripper end-effector

I want to use a gripper end-effector (3 fingers, single actuator tendon-driven with force sensors in fingers) to grip and hold fragile objects such as an egg. I can not seem to figure out which control scheme would be most appropriate for the situation. Would using an impedance control with negligible dynamic interaction be effective or a hybrid control with force/position control?
My idea was to simply tense the tendon (slowly) encompassing the object until the force sensor gives a feedback that contact has been made (+ a little grip force), what category of control scheme would that fall into?

A:

If you have a simple controller (e.g. force control or position control) the factor which decides what kind of controller is it is the reference signal which has to correspond to the feedback signal. 

My idea was to simply tense the tendon (slowly) encompassing the object until the force sensor gives a feedback that contact has been made (+ a little grip force), what category of control scheme would that fall into ?

If tensing the tendon is through a force signal then this is force control. If you do it by position or velocity (since you mentioned slowly) then it is position control. This idea will most probably be simple to implement and will work (but this is an opinion based remark). You will find many examples for using impedance control for gripping in the scientific literature. It is generally a good idea to start with something simple (incrementing tension until a threshold) and develop that further to impedance control if ti doesn't perform good enough. 
Hybrid control has probably many different definitions, the one if which is commonly used in robotics, which is position control in on dimension, force control in a different dimension. (i.e. writing on a white board with the robot controlling the marker, keep force contact perpendicular to the position controlled heading direction).
