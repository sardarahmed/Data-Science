A:

Sounds like you have to run
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-map-server

(assuming you're using ROS Indigo). If that doesn't help, there might indeed be a problem with your path setup and @TomSon's advice applies.

thanks.I used to run sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-map-server, but it prints: ros-indigo-map-server :Depends: libsdl-image1.2-dev but it is not going to be installed.I don't know how to do next?

This means you likely have some sort of package install/version conflict that normally does not appear on a clean Ubuntu install. Either google for "is not going to be installed" and learn how to resolve this, or perform a fresh install of Ubuntu.

Thanks. I use sudo aptitude install libsdl-image1.2-dev,and it works....Although I don't know why.

Ok, normally dependencies like this should be installed automatically, so there might still be an issue lingering. But you can probably ignore that for now :)

I tried to run sudo aptitude install libsdl-image1.2-dev and remove installed version, then re-install. It works ok
