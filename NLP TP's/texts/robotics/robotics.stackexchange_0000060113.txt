Q:

Moveit Python Demo causes [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

Hello ROS Community,
This is my first post to this forum.  I am attempting to run the tutorial for moveit using python. Specifically the Move Group Interface/Python API tutorial.  Sorry, my karma is not yet good enough to post links.

I am running python 2.7.
OS is Ubuntu 12.04
ROS and ROS packages are installed using apt-get

I have created a package called my_youbot_moveit with a simple python script.  The script contains the following:
import sys
import copy
import rospy
import moveit_commander
import moveit_msgs.msg
import geometry_msgs.msg

print("============ Starting tutorial setup")
moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
rospy.init_node('move_group_python_interface_tutorial', anonymous=True)

When I run the code
source ~/catkin/develop/setup.bash
rosrun my_youbot_moveit my_youbot_moveit.py

I get the error
Exception in thread Thread-3:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 551, in __bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 504, in run
    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospy/impl/tcpros_base.py", line 153, in run
    (client_sock, client_addr) = self.server_sock.accept()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py", line 202, in accept
    sock, addr = self._sock.accept()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py", line 170, in _dummy
    raise error(EBADF, 'Bad file descriptor')
error: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

Please help me understand what is causing this problem and how to solve it.

I reran the moveit setup assistant, and this problem went away.  Must have been an error in one of my configuration files
