Q:

pcl::ConvexHull not instantiated for pcl::PointXY?

I get a linker error:
undefined reference to  pcl::ConvexHullpcl::PointXY::reconstruct(pcl::PointCloudpcl::PointXY&)
My manifest.xml includes "pcl" and "pcl_ros" listed as dependencies
Should I use some other point type for computing convex hull of 2D points?
pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXY> rectConvexHull;  // the convex hull in ROS.

void compute2DConvexHull()
{
    if(rectConvexHull.size()>0)
        return;
    
    pcl::ConvexHull<pcl::PointXY> computeConvexHull;
    
    computeConvexHull.setInputCloud(scene2DPtr);

    computeConvexHull.setIndices(getPointIndicesBoostPtr());

    computeConvexHull.reconstruct(rectConvexHull);
}

I'd suggest asking this on pcl-users; you'll probably get a quicker response there.

A:

I am not completely sure because it has been a while, but I believe you have to use pcl::PointXYZ with z=0 (or another arbitrary constant) for all points. You can try to #include <pcl/surface/impl/convex_hull.hpp> instead, but if I remember correctly, the implementation actually expects 3D points and will choke on pcl::PointXY.
