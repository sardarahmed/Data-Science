Q:

rospy rqt - fullscreen?

Hi again,
I need to make an RQT plugin use the full display. I don't want to have a title bar, even task bars of the underlying linux shall be hidden. This is dueto the fact that the resolution of the physical display is pretty small and I don't want to lose too much space to unneeded elements.
Do you have an idea on how I can achieve this? Thanks!
Cheers,
Hendrik

A:

There are options that help maximize screen space:
-l, --lock-perspective
                    lock the GUI to the used perspective (hide menu bar
                    and close buttons of plugins)
-ht, --hide-title     hide the title label, the icon, and the help button
                    (combine with -l and -f to eliminate the entire title
                    bar and reclaim the space)

Used in combination they get rid of a lot of space used by the overall rqt title bar and per-plugin title bars.
Unfortunately there is currently a bug with loading a perspective file and using --lock-perspective:
rqt --perspective-file tmp.perspective -l
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/bin/rqt", line 13, in <module>
    sys.exit(main.main())
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_gui/main.py", line 59, in main
    return super(Main, self).main(argv, standalone=standalone, plugin_argument_provider=plugin_argument_provider, plugin_manager_settings_prefix=str(hash(os.environ['ROS_PACKAGE_PATH'])))
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qt_gui/main.py", line 530, in main
    perspective_manager.import_perspective_from_file(self._options.perspective_file, perspective_manager.HIDDEN_PREFIX + os.path.basename(self._options.perspective_file))
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qt_gui/perspective_manager.py", line 330, in import_perspective_from_file
    self._remove_perspective(perspective_name)
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qt_gui/perspective_manager.py", line 305, in _remove_perspective
    self._menu_manager.remove_item(name)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'remove_item'

(I'll look into fixing this.  One note is that the default perspective gets loaded fine with lock-perspective however)
Combining --clear-config with the other options prevents this issue.
It would also be nice to have --full-screen option to launch straight to maximized mode regardless of how the perspective was saved, and so the user doesn't have to double click on the window manager title bar or click on the maximize button.
