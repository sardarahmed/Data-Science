Q:

Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-image-transport

I have been trying to get this to work for multiple weeks now. Very frustrated.
I have a pi 3 running Jessie. Ran all the steps in http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi
and I am still getting "Unable to locate package ...." I cannot locate any of them.
My /etc/apt/source.list is
deb http://mirrordirector.raspian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
and my /etc/apt/source.list.d/ros-lastest.list is
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu jessie main
My ultimate goal is to utilize this code to publish images/videos from the pi over ros node back to my laptop computer.
Can somebody help me please?

May I know how you solve it? I struggle for it for a long time but still don't know how to solve it
I donlt know how to install ros package from source on raspberry pi

A:

You've installed ROS from source, so you should follow the directions at the end of the installation about adding released packages when you want to install additional packages.
Since you've installed from source, you shouldn't expect to install new packages through apt-get.
