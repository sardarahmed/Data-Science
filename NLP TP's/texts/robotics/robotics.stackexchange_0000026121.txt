Q:

Vehicle doesn't react to drive commands in current default branch of gazebo/drcsim built from source

Hi everyone, the tutorial for making the vehicle move via topics doesn't work in a current build from source anymore. It worked before with drcsim-2.2 installed from .debs. Any pointers why that is and how to get back control of the vehice would be appreciated.

A:

The handbrake functionality has been changed recently, so that it can be controlled manually. This caused a change in the behaviour when using ROS topic control, however, so that the handbrake cannot be directly commanded from 0 to 1, or 1 to 0. Try sending a command of 0.5 and then the final command and let me know if that works.
