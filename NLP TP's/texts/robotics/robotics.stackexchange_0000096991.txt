Q:

invalid preprocessing directive #!

I'm trying to build a dynamic configuration for a cpp application and I'm adapting the tutorial. I'm getting the following error in my cfg file. Any insight you have will be appreciated.
error: invalid preprocessing directive #!
2 | #!/usr/bin/env python
I've already tried chmod a+x on the file
python version is 3.8.2

Can you please update your question and add a copy of your cfg file? It looks to me like the most likely cause is an improperly formatted first line. Your cfg file should have only the following on the first line: #!/usr/bin/env python. No extra characters or spaces.

A:

I fixed it by removing an accidental space in the file
