Q:

How to generate custom control sets for Smac State Lattice Planner?

https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-smac-planner.html
Link shows " See the Smac Planner package to generate custom control sets for your vehicle ". But was not able to find how to generate custom json file (lattice_filepath argument in plugin nav2_smac_planner/SmacPlannerLattice).
Any leads will be helpful!
Thank you.

But I also haven't really understand how to make properly own, custom ones. I tried (manually) define the output.json file, but with unsuccessful results (at least the Planner didn't behave as I expected)
