Q:

the best detect and recognition method

Hi all, i am building my vision system to detect and recognition objects ..
firstly, i did object 3D model cloud points Using Roboearth Stack
then tried to detect it with roboearth detector package but it isn't the best because:

detect Only texture objects and i have One colored objects
red marker not located all the time
can't detect the object when turning it reversal
i tried to add 2 models to detect them in the same time but it didn't work

i will make some reasoning relations on these objects after that in Knowrob
So, i want a help to choose the best method to detection and recognition objects
i am reading in bigg_detector now and searching at others ..
any help to choose the best detect and recognition method ??

Hi Salma,
There are several object detectors/recognizers that you could test to have an idea of the complexity of the task and figure out which one better fits your needs:

http://ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition/user.html: provides you LINE-MOD (which should detect non-textured objects), TOD and transparent objects detection
http://www.pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/#recognition-tutorial: PCL is indeed a powerful option to detect non-textured objects
http://www.ros.org/wiki/blort_ros: monocular model based object detector (see tutorials in http://www.ros.org/wiki/blort_ros/Tutorials)
http://personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/moped.php
and many more out there ...

@Jordi Pages  thanks alot ,, very useful links ... i am building a system can deal with roboearth server
So i nees OWL description of the model to be knowledge in Knowrob  thats why i used roboearth stack ,, i don't know if I must use it to detect and recognition the object or can use any method
