A:

I think I have found the problem. The package is named "turtlebot_teleop", not "turtle_teleop".
allenh1@muri-pc7:~$ rospack find turtle_teleop
[rospack] Error: stack/package turtle_teleop not found
allenh1@muri-pc7:~$ rospack find turtlebot_teleop
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_teleop

I am running Ubuntu 12.04. I installed ROS with the package manager. If you did otherwise, then this answer may not be correct; however, I imagine the package names are static on most platforms. Let me know if this doesn't work!
