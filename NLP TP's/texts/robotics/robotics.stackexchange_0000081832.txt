Q:

ROS Indigo installation problem on Raspbian Jessie

Hi all,
I was using the tutorial [http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi] to install ROS on my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (Raspbian Jessie) to control a robot called Baxter and run Gazebo (Simulation tool for ROS).
Currently, I am having problems in the step where I have to build the catkin packages (Step 3.3 'Building the catkin Workspace' on the tutorial. The problem is that it says:
CMake Error at gtest/cmake_install.cmake:42(file):
    file INSTALL cannot find
    "home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin/gtest/libgtest.so".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
    cmake_install.cmake:154 (include)

Can anyone give me some directions to overcome this problem?
Thanks!

Please don't use screenshots for what is essentially text. Just copy-paste terminal text into your question and make sure to use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) to format it properly.

Sorry there, first time using public Q&A forums. Fixed up my question :)

A:

I got the same issue ... before this error, on warnings the compiler said something about "Target "gtest" has EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL" and I thought that someone is telling to exclude and the error said this lib may be included!!
So for a rapid test I got into the
cd ~/ros_catkin_ws/src/catkin/cmake/test

and edited the gtest.cmake
sudo nano gtest.cmake

Commenting this line (#) to avoid the exclusion of this files:
if(ARG_EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
    #set_target_properties(${target} PROPERTIES EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL TRUE)
endif()

and comment too
#set_target_properties(gtest gtest_main PROPERTIES EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL 1)

Save the file and try again
After that, the compiler compile the gtest and worked fine
Its not a definitive solution, but works well, it helps!!
Another aproach is to remove the gtest compile, but not tested it yet
Thanks
(PS: in this tutorial they remove the ros_lisp (--exclude roslisp) because the "dependency sbcl is not available in the Raspbian" ... but I have included and the dependency is ok by now!!)
