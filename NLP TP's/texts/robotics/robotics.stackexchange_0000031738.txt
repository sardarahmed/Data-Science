Q:

Rosjava + Android phone + Kinect, is it possible?

Hi All,
The announcement of the Java wrapper to run ROS on Android phones is really exciting. I was wondering how someone might connect a Kinect to an android phone to use it as a sensor? I'd like to build a small robot and an Android phone seems like a great alternative to a fully blown laptop.
Any help would be appreciated.

Two thoughts:

You'll have the usual powering-the-Kinect problem. Just a USB port isn't enough; see the Create <-> Kinect Tutorial for details on how to build a power supply in a particular case.
The Kinect (both the OpenNI and libfreenect versions) are in C[++], not Java. I don't know if user processes on Android have to be in Java, but just having ROSJava doesn't get you Kinect support out of the box.

A related datapoint: a while back, I tried using a Kinect on embedded computer with a single-core 1.2GHz ARM processor.  That machine had a hard time keeping up with the data from the Kinect.  I summarized my experience (including source for a stripped down Kinect node) here.

I also do not believe that anyone has successfully demonstrated the USB Host interface is capable of handling the data rate produced by the Kinect.
