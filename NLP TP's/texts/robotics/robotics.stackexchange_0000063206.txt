Q:

Is there any SLAM method based on Octomap representation?

I know what I am saying here is not precise.I know Octomap is a 3D occupancy grid mapping approach based on an octree and there are some SLAM methods that works based on 2D occupancy grids. E.g. Gmapping: a 2D grid-based SLAM algorithm that provides a 2-D occupancy grid map from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot and Hector SLAM: a 2D grid-based SLAM algorithm that provides a 2-D occupancy grid map using combination of high update 2D mapping and 6DOF pose estimation.
I wanted to know is there any available package (or publication) that tries to use octomap representation to tackle SLAM problem?

Yes there is, you can see here :

F. Endres, J. Hess, J. Sturm, D. Cremers, and W. Burgard. 3-d mapping with an rgb-d camera. Robotics, IEEE Transactions on, 30(1) :177–187, Feb 2014.

Good luck

Thank you. I saw the first paper and it seems they did every thing (e.g. extracting visual features, ...) using point clouds and next used Octomap to just reduce the map size.
I added this, just to clarify the subject for future readers.
