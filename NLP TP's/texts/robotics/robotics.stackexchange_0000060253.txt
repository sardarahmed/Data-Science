Q:

Is there interest in maintaining chef cookbooks for ROS?

Chef is my tool of choice for configuration management. It's pretty easy-to-use, has strong community and solid integration with VMs and clouds. I'd like to use it to provision all my ROS-based development VMs and physical nodes.
I found a couple uses of it with ROS:

https://github.com/ull-isaatc/grull_vagrant/blob/master/cookbooks/ros/
https://github.com/garaemon/garaemon-settings/tree/master/chef/site-cookbooks/ros

(sorry, not enough karma to publish links properly)
Both seem to be parts of personal/project setups that could be refactored/extracted into standalone cookbooks.
What would chef be good for? Building fully-configured systems that are ready to run:

building VMs with ROS: ready to run, do development, run tests
makes CI configuration easy
pulling 3rd party dependencies (bag files, models, etc) that project-specific and aren't part of an install
building boxes in the cloud with ROS

Q1: Is there interest?
Q2: Am I missing other existing examples?
Q3: What do people use right now?
Thanks a lot!

A:

I'm the author of https://github.com/garaemon/garaemon-settings/tree/master/chef/site-cookbooks/ros, however
I have no passion about maitaining this cookbook yet.
Now I'm using simple shell script https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_common/blob/master/jsk.rosbuild rather than chef cookbook to build ROS environment.

Can you elaborate on your motivation for not using chef? Not necessary? Hard to maintain? Something else?

It was hard to maintain and I think the effort to maintain it is not worth to the effect.
