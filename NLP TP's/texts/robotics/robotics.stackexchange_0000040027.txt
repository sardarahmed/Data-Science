Q:

rosserial_arduino on fuerte

Hey,
I installed fuerte yesterday on my Pandaboard, building everything from the source, and all builds find except for rosserial_arduino. It gives me the following compiling error :
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "../rosserial_client/src/rosserial_client/make_library.py", line 583, in <module>
    MakeLibrary(package, path)
  File "../rosserial_client/src/rosserial_client/make_library.py", line 523, in MakeLibrary
    md5sum = roslib.gentools.compute_md5(roslib.gentools.get_file_dependencies(file))
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib-1.8.4-py2.7.egg/roslib/gentools.py", line 275, in get_file_dependencies
    return get_dependencies(spec, package, stdout, stderr)
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslib-1.8.4-py2.7.egg/roslib/gentools.py", line 318, in get_dependencies
    raise MsgSpecException("Cannot load type %s.  Perhaps the package is missing a dependency."%(str(e)))
roslib.msgs.MsgSpecException: Cannot load type 'geometry_msgs/PoseStamped'.  Perhaps the package is missing a dependency.

Other packages that depend on geometry_msgs seem to compile fine, what is wrong with rosserial_arduino that it will fail to compile ?

Comment by Eric Perko on 2012-04-29:
Does rosserial_arduino declare a dependency on geometry_msgs in its manifest.xml?

A:

The issue is not a direct dependency on geometry_msgs, but the message generation script (rosserial_client/src/rosserial_clientmake_library.py) that creates libraries for messages on the arduino. The script fails on geometry_msgs/PoseStamped.
This issue is described in greater detail in this ticket, and a patch is attached to the ticket.

@piyushk: With the attached patch, how one should proceed with the fiix? I never have experience using patch, is it the one ".diff", BTW, how to use it?

You can read more about apply patches at http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/appy-patch-file-using-patch-command/ You need to run "roscd rosserial" and then "patch -p1 < /path/to/patch-file"
