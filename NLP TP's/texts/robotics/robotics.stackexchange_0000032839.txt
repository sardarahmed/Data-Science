Q:

Is it possible to plot different topics on the same plot in rxbag?

I have several distinct topics saved in a bag and I would like to plot them on the same plot for comparison purposes in rxbag. This works great for values in the same topic, but I don't know if I can do this for different topics.

A:

For plotting you can use rxplot. You can plot any numeric value from any plot. You will be able to plot them in the same plot, or separated plots but in the same screen. Have a look at the documentation since it is very easy to use.
I hope this helps.

Playing bag files and using rxplot could be a good alternative. If not, have a look at http://www.ros.org/wiki/rxbag_plugins I haven't used it but it seems it can help you.

I know about rxplot, but I have bag files. Are you suggesting that I have to play the bag files back to get the functionality of rxplot, when there is a tool rxbag designed for viewing and plotting data in bag files? I just want to plot two topics to the same plot (not even the same graph).
