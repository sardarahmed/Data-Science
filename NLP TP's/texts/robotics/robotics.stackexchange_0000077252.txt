Q:

catkin cmake error with ros (error code 1)

Hello everyone, I am following the tutorial here to create a workspace with catkin: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
When I invoke catkin_make, I get this output:

Please include at least:

which OS this is
how you installed ROS (from sources, installed Debians)
the exact commands you used to create your workspace
the contents of /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/../package.xml

A:

I solved this problem using:
pip install -U rosdep rosinstall_generator wstool rosinstall six vcstools

To avoid others to blindly copy-n-paste your approach: you should only install ROS Python packages using pip on systems which don't have Debian packages. On Debian systems you should use apt to update the installed binary packages.

It works for me.
And also, my python path need to designate, we can use -t for pip:
pip install -t /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/  'your package'
