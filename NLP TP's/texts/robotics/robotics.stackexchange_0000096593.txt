Q:

Cannot locate node of type [state_publisher]

Currently running ROS Noetic (installed with apt) on Debian 10, I tried to follow the URDF tutorial : http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Using%20urdf%20with%20robot_state_publisher.
However I get the following error message when launching the display.launch file :
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [robot_state_publisher/state_publisher]: Cannot locate node of type [state_publisher] in package [robot_state_publisher]. Make sure file exists in package path and permission is set to executable (chmod +x)

I tried every other solution I could find online but nothing works for me... Maybe I missed something.
Thanks in advance !

do you have the package correctly installed?
Try:
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-robot-state-publisher

A:

state_publisher was a deprecated alias for the node named robot_state_publisher. It was removed in https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher/pull/87 which is included in the ROS Noetic release of that package.  Change type="state_publisher" to type="robot_state_publisher".
<!-- Change state_publisher  -->
<!-- <node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher" /> -->
<!-- To robot_state_publisher -->
<node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="robot_state_publisher" />

I updated the tutorial.
