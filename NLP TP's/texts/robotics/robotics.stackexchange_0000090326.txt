Q:

RQT: setNativeLocks failed

Hi,
I am using ROS Kinetic in Ubuntu 16.04
I find that if I use any of the rqt_* commands such as rqt_graph, the terminal hangs and I get a continuous error as under
setNativeLocks failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
setNativeLocks failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
setNativeLocks failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
setNativeLocks failed: Resource temporarily unavailable

If I kill the process, then I get the below error
sigint_handler()
MainWindow.closeEvent()
Killed

I checked the Qt bindings and it looks like I am using PyQt5
$ python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 12 2018, 14:36:49) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import python_qt_binding
>>> print(python_qt_binding.QT_BINDING)
pyqt
>>> from python_qt_binding.QtWidgets import QWidget
>>> print(python_qt_binding.QT_BINDING_VERSION)
5.5.1

Not sure how to debug this issue. Any help is appreciated.

A:

From some Googling this seems like an issue with Qt (5). Some results seem to indicate it has to do with file locking. Are you running this in a VM, have a home dir mounted over NFS, a file with /dev in its name in /tmp or some other strange setup?

Thanks for the comment @gvdhoorn. It was my home dir mounted over NFS that was causing the issue. I unmounted it and the locks have disappeared.
