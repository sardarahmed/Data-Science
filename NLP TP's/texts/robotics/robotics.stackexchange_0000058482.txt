Q:

import select ImportError: No module named select

Since yesterday I've been having a problem to use the next command:

$ rospack depends1 rospy

And any other command like this.
I receive the next output:

$ rospack depends1 rospy

not function properly Cannot import

import select ImportError: No module named select [rospack] Error:
could not find python module
'rosdep2.rospack'. is rosdep
up-to-date (at least 0.10.4)?

I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal), with ROS-HYDRO.
My rosdep version is:

$ rosdep --version

0.10.25

I've already tried to find some solution, but I couldn't. I've tried to 'autoremove' ros and clean install again, but nothing changed.
When I try to 'import select' using the python environment in terminal, everything is OK.
My PYTHONPATH is OK, as follows:

$ echo $PYTHONPATH

/home/usr/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

Can anybody help me please?

Thanks for trying to help! I had some other problems with my ubuntu and so I re-installed everything! Now I don't have that problem anymore, neither the other problems... =)

A:

I discovered why I had that problem! Like tfoote thought, I have some custom paths, and the python paths got into a conflict! I just organized them and everything is in ok now!

As I'm working with NAO robot, I indicate its paths in the .bashrc file, one of them indicates the $PYTHONPATH. This path got into a conflit with the paths in ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash. Everything was solved when I put the source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash AFTER exporting the NAO's python path.
