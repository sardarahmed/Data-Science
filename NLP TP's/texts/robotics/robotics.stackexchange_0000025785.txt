Q:

How is GetLinkById() supposed to work in Gazebo 1.3?

Hi,
After I upgraded to Gazebo 1.3 (from 1.2.5) I noticed the model->GetLink() function has changed. It does not overload anymore with the (string) link_name or with the (unsigned int) id arguments.

 Now there are two functions GetLink(string link_name) and GetLinkByID(unsigned int _id).
However the later GetLinkById() it doesn't work.
Is it a bug? Or am I not using it right, I used it for example with values 0 or 1 (0 being until now the first link of the model).
Code example:
this->model->GetLinkById(0)->GetName().c_str()
The error I get:
gzserver: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:418: T* boost::shared_ptr<T>::operator->() const [with T = gazebo::physics::Link]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.

Thanks, Andrei

A:

The ID of a link is a unique integer that is assigned when the Link is instantiated. The ID is primarily used for internal purposes.
