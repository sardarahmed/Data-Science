Q:

How to publish +Inf and -Inf in sensor_msgs/Range?

From the documentation, if value of sonar is more than max range, +Inf should be published. Similarly for min range and -Inf. But how do I do that? The script would only accept float values.

A:

float("inf") and float("-inf") for python.
std::numeric_limits<sensor_msgs::Range::_range_type>::infinity() for C++. std::numeric_limits<float>::infinity() will also work, but assumes that range will not change to float64 in the future.
On Arduino you can use INFINITY.
