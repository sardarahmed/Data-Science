Q:

Rqt plugin: qt_gui_main() found no plugin

Hi,
I am trying to implement my own rqt plugin with C++. It consist of a QGraphicsView with few QGraphicsItems.
I did it like in rqt_image_view, basically by copying and adjusting the content of CMakeList.txt, package.xml, plugin.xml, setup.py.
However it is build without any errors when I try to launch it I get a message:
qt_gui_main() found no plugin matching "agent_gui"
I have no idea what can I do wrong here. I have included PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro in source file of my class inheriting from rqt_gui_cpp::Plugin, added appropriate export in plugin.xml. Just like in rqt_image_view plugin and the tutorial.
I use ROS groovy and catkin on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
Thanks in advance, I appreciate any help.
Filip

A:

OK, I solved the problem in other way.
I had to change library path in plugin.xml from scr to lib : 
Now everything works.
