Q:

stereo image proc bypass

Ubuntu 14.04
ROS Indigo Igloo
Bumblebee2

Hello!
I am using a lookup table to rectify the images extracted with camera1394stereo generated outside ROS with triclops. Now I have the "perfect" rectification but I want to bypass the stereo image proc to avoid the process of rectification, normalization and rotation.
I just want to generate the disparity image and the PointCloud2 image to use it in viso2_ros. The problem is that I don't have the correct parameters to fill the camera_info msg left and right cameras. As long I understand, viso2_ros use image_proc to do all the process to generate rectified images.
Is there some way to use image_proc, stereo_image_proc or depth_image_proc to get the disparity image and the pointCloud without do the rectification?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I think even at a very high level, image_proc inherently deals with data from only one camera, thus can't produce the kind of information you're looking for. You NEED to process data from multiple information sources to obtain disparity and pointcloud data, which is what stereo_image_proc and depth_image_proc are designed to do.
