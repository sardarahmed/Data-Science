Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROSJOY Node

Hi, I'm using Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.
I have been using ROS for a few months, but have very little programming knowledge. I was asked to write a node to control a servo using a joystick (and Arduino). The most experience I have in this s controlling an AR Drone with a ps3 controller. I have looked at the Writing a Teleop node tutorial, but thatâ€™s it. I get what the script is doing, but that is not the same as knowing how to do it myself. Does anyone know of a good source to learn how to write such a node, preferably in python. Or, are there any scripts for controlling a servo with rosjoy?
Thanks.

A:

There are lots of good places on the internet to learn python. I know a few people that like the codeacademy course: http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python
The ROS tutorials are a good place to get started working with ROS.
The rospy publisher and subscriber tutorial goes through the basics of writing a simple publisher and subscriber in python.
The biggest trick to learning programming is that you have to practice a lot. Start with something close to what you want, and try to modify it to suit your purposes. Test early and often. There's usually a fair amount of failing in there as well.
