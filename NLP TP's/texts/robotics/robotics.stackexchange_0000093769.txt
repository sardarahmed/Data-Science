Q:

Converting ros::Time to C++ string

How can we convert the result of ros::Time::now() into std::string, given that std::string to_string (*) in C++11 doesn't support this conversion ?

Answer to convert to a formatted date time string using boost::posix_time::to_iso_extended_string #q251966

A:

You probably want to use the ros::Time::now().toSec() result, which is a double.
http://docs.ros.org/latest/api/rostime/html/classros_1_1TimeBase.html#ab63e3c9f57032143d4eeac4a7ac272a5
Then you can convert that double to a string with std::string to_string.
You could use strftime to convert the double to many different string formats as well.
