Q:

unistall hydro version

Hi everyone
I have three different versions of ROS installed on my system and i want to unistall Hydro. I can not do it with

sudo apt-get remove ros-hydro

I think it is a wrong command. Does anyone know how should i do it??? thanks:))

I could unistall it successfully and I tried to reinstall hydro because it had some problems. When i try again i see:

The following packages have unmet
dependencies:  ros-hydro-desktop-full
: Depends: ros-hydro-simulators but it
is not going to be installed E: Unable
to correct problems, you have held
broken packages.

Does anyone know what is the problem??
