Q:

Can't install (Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/precise/Release )

I've followed the install tutorial several times but I keep getting the following error:
W: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/precise/Release  Unable to find expected entry '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list/binary-amd64/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)

Have you tried deleting that file? Checked your Internet connection? Are you certain that you got the keys?

I deleted that file and started over again.  It seems to be working now.  Thanks!

No problem! Glad I could help!

A:

From the comments, the solution to this problem is to run the following:
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list/binary-amd64/Packages

Then just start the install tutorial over again.
