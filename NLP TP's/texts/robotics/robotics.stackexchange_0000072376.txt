Q:

Descartes Robot Path Editor

There is a Robot Path Editor in Descartes Sneak Peek video demo. I saw robot_path_editor_gui.rviz at the upper left corner of the video. However, I cannot find a link related to it with google.
Though, I do find an interesting Cartesian Path Planner Plug-in for MoveIt.
I would like to create a list of Robot Path Editors:

fermi - Cartesian Path Planner MoveIt Plug-in, source code, tutorial
... please help providing Robot Path Editors

A:

Afaik, that UI is a proprietary component that came out of a ROS-I project. It is unlikely to be made open-source. It's also not part of the descartes packages.
