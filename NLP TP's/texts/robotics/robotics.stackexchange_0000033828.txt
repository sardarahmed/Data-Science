Q:

CodeRef macro fails on a wiki page

In wiki page http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF , a macro to refer to code block doesn't properly shows the result and we see on page:
Error: No code_block

wiki code looks:
{{{#!cplusplus block=broadcaster 
 :
}}}
 :
<<CodeRef(broadcaster, 2, 2)>> 

which looks correct. Server side issues?
Env: Mac OSX 10.6.8, Firefox 3.6.20

@tfoote the error can be found after each code citation block for 2 .cpp codes. The error was already there when I first opened the wiki page.

It looks correct.  Can you point to where you're trying to use it?

BTW How do I start a new line in comment?

@AzureViolin I took a glimpse at the pages you refer to and found no issues in codes; scope is write. block may be missing from the robot_state_publisher one though.

A:

1 day afterward I found the issue is gone. I viewed from the same computer, same environment. What I did is just wait a day and reboot the computer. Good thing is it's solved. Bad is I didn't check other environment. Anyway thanks!
