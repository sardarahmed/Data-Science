Q:

PointXYZ python usage question

I am trying to include PointXYZ in a python pgm. But it is unable to locate PointXYZ. If I include the import pcl it say it can not find module pcl.  Is there a install I am missing or is there no python wrapper for it?
         self.subPoseWithCovar = rospy.Subscriber("/depth/points", PointXYZ, self.callback)
         self.tf_pub = rospy.Publisher("/depth/points2", PointXYZ, queue_size=10)

A:

What exactly are you trying to subscribe to? /depth/points is probably going to be a message of type
sensor_msgs/PointCloud2. There are no official PCL bindings for python, so you will need to use something like sensor_msgs/point_cloud2.py to convert the data to a usable format.

I wanted to translate a pointcloud2 into another frame. There is a method in c++ method transformPointCloud is there a similar python method you know of.

If all you want the node to do is transform the point cloud from one frame to another, it will be very slow in python (you'd have to transform each point individually). However, you can use a PassThrough filter and set the output_frame.

Seeing the PointXYZ I take it PassThrough filters are not in Python. I will write the cpp pgm.

The PassThrough filter isn't in python, but using it doesn't require writing any code at all, just configuring it in a launch file.
