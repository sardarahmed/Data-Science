Q:

Package cannot find nav_msgs even though its listed as a dependency?

Hello, I am trying to run a ROS node for the ax2550 motor controller, found here:
https://github.com/wjwwood/ax2550
However, when I try to compile with catkin_make, I get the following error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/genmsg/cmake/genmsg-extras.cmake:255 (message):
Messages depends on unknown pkg: nav_msgs (Missing find_package(nav_msgs?))
Call Stack (most recent call first):
ax2550/CMakeLists.txt:22 (generate_messages)
Everything I can find about this error online simply indicates that I need to specify nav_msgs as a dependency to my package, but it's already there:
<build_depend>nav_msgs</build_depend>
<run_depend>nav_msgs</run_depend>
Any ideas as to what could br going wrong?

Make sure that nav_msgs is installed, the following command should show the path to nav_msgs: rospack find nav_msgs

It is installed, and entering that command returns the correct path: /opt/ros/hydro/share/nav_msgs.  Although maybe its possible that the node isn't looking for nav_msgs there--I don't know hot tell from the code or the error.

A:

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-common-msgs

Tried that but it said it installed nothing new.  Nav_msgs is already installed.

This sounds like its an environment issue. Could you install ros-hydro-common-msgs from source and try recompiling?  (with the ax550 and the nav_msgs in the same src directory).
As well, please sudo rm -rf devel build inside your catkin_ws.

Reinstalling it from source in the same src directory did the trick.  For anyone else with this problem,
git clone https://github.com/ros/common_msgs

And then catkin_make again.  Thanks!

It might have been only a matter of rebuilding the catking_ws. I would try to remove the source code for common_msgs that you just installed and rm -rf devel build inside your catking_ws, then catkin_make again and see what happens.

Tried that, but got the same error again; "messages depends on unknown package: nav_msgs"
