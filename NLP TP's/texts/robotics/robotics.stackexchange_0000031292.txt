Q:

TF Frame Convention for Stereo Cameras

I am using a stereo camera for both stereo reconstruction and monocular image processing. Since I am not calibrating the pair of cameras twice, I am doing all of the monocular processing using the stereo calibration parameters. For the camera intrinsics, this works fine. I am not sure how to handle the extrinsics.
I would like to have the left and right cameras in different TF frames that correspond to their positions on my robot (e.g. /stereo_left_link and /stereo_right_link). Since the stereo baseline is encoded in the stereo calibration parameters, I am not sure stereo_image_proc will deal with the two images being in different TF frames.
What is the correct way to set the CameraInfo and Image message frame_ids to safely proceed to avoid being affected by the potential inconsistencies?

A:

You could check out uvc_camera's stereo_node as somewhere to start.
