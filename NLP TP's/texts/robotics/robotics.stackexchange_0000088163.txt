Q:

Which line extraction algorithms are used in gmapping and cartographer packages?

I was wondering which line extraction algorithms are used in gmapping and cartographer packages?
I couldn't find this information on the ROS wiki websites.
Some of the possible options are

Split-and-merge
Hough-transform
RANSAC
Incremental
Line-regression
Expectation maximization

Thanks!

A:

These are 2D planar slam algorithms, not line detectors. I'd recommend just reading the code. Gmapping is very short and Cartographer has more than adequate documentation to guide you in what each are doing, but there is not a line detection component in any of these I do not believe.
