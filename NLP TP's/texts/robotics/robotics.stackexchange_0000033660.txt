Q:

ROS Stack/Package to Deb/Ubuntu package mapping?

When rosmake cannot build something because of a missing dependency on some particular package it informs the user of the missing package. If it is a system package, it can produce the apt-get line.
However, if it's a ROS package it's not always clear what deb package that might be part of without doing a bit of research on ros.org
Is there a command line way of determining what deb package must be obtained to get a particular ROS package?
I've tried apropos and apt-cache search without much success. Is there a better/endorsed way to do this? Am I missing something obvious?
