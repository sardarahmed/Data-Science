Q:

robot_pose_ekf with only odometry information

Hi rossers ;).
My robot delivers only very noisy odometry data. The worst character of that noise are sudden peaks of extremely unlikely data and sudden accelerations. I thought about using some kind of Bayesian filter to just filter that data based on an expected variance. Can I use the robot_pose_ekf-node for that? Of cause, it would not fusion any data. But can it just serve as a basic probabilistic filter? Will it also work on one data source to create a speed hypothesis?
Thanks for your help

A:

robot_pose_ekf is not terribly easy to adapt to new situations or use cases. If you understand how to implement the bayesian filter that you need, it will probably be easier to write and debug your own filter.
You may also want to look into the robot_localization and graft packages for more general-purpose kalman filter nodes.
