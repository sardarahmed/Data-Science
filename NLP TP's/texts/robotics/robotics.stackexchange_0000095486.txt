Q:

Hector slam incremental mapping

I want to have hector slam loaded with a pre-saved map , but NOT for localization only (so can't go to AMCL) , it is for performing mapping and update the saved map with the new info found in the world that weren't in the saved map (the world changed) .
To be specific : suppose a robot scanned the map of an entire floor with hector slam and saved the map successfully . Now next time the robot will use the saved map , BUT the floor itself changed a little bit (positions of obstacles changed, new obstacles or new free areas rise) so I want  be aware and map those to the saved map , sort of logical OR operator between the saved map and hector's incremental findings.
If I tried just publish the saved map to the hector's map topic , hector will overwrite it with its own map , so maybe if there's a way to just make hector take the last msg from the map topic , (logical or ) to add the new updates , and then publish it .
This will not make it a closed loop in the sense that it closed the loop to improve performance in any way , its just publishing updates on the saved thing instead of publishing a new thing

You can look in to Jin-W-FS's Pull Request at https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam/pull/45
I am also currently trying to implement the features that you have mentioned.

great !
I'll mark this as an answer since I didn't find more useful resources.
It seems that the PR works well when the robot starts from the same initial pose of the saved map , but I still have to try myself , did you try it and can confirm?
