Q:

Ignition Citadel Error: Failed to create a bridge for topic

Hi there,
I saw that Ignition is the new "Gazebo" and that it'd be what will be developed moving forward. I wanted to try it out; however, when I run the following command:
ros2 run ros_ign_bridge parameter_bridge /TOPIC@ROS_MSG@IGN_MSG

I get the following error:
Failed to create a bridge for topic [/TOPIC] with ROS2 type [ROS_MSG] and Ignition Transport type [IGN_MSG]

I'm running ROS2 Foxy on Ubuntu 20.04. I have followed the installation instructions here: https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/citadel/install_ubuntu. I can run Ignition, i.e. I can view the GUI etc.
I can't see what I did wrong; any help would be greatly appreciated.
Best regards,
Frazer

Just in case, /TOPIC, @ROS_MSG and @IGN_MSG are just templates that you should replace for your specific example. In case you're doing it, could you type the exact example that it's not working?

My mistake was that I was typing: ros2 run ros_ign_bridge parameter_bridge /TOPIC@ROS_MSG@IGN_MSG, but I should have typed: ros2 run ros_ign_bridge parameter_bridge /keyboard/keypress@std_msgs/msg/Int32@ignition.msgs.Int32.

A:

In the command you ran, TOPIC, ROS_MSG, and IGN_MSG need to be replaced with a particular topic, ros message type, and ignition message type, respectively.
It looks like you are following the ROS 2 integration tutorial. The bidirectional communication section outlines the format for running a ros2 run ros_ign_bridge ... command, but the actual command you want to run is shown in the publish keystrokes to ROS section, which can be found just below the command you ran originally:
ros2 run ros_ign_bridge parameter_bridge /keyboard/keypress@std_msgs/msg/Int32@ignition.msgs.Int32
The arguments for this command are also explained in the "publish keystrokes to ROS section" that I just shared with you, so I'd encourage you to read through that link to get a better understanding of this command if needed.
The ros_ign_bridge repository also has a few examples that you can test if needed. I hope this helps!
