A:

As Groovy is the latest release, i would go for that one under Ubuntu 11.10
The reasons are because many tools have been upgraded or updated.
Please note that Groovy is the latest release, Fuerte is the previous one (and my second choice as it is a relatively stable and well-documented version) and electric is the oldest one you mentioned.

+1 If you are just starting a project, it makes sense to use the most recent ROS distro that is supported on your platform, in this case Groovy. Note however, that Hydro will not support Ubuntu 11.10. You might want to upgrade to 12.04, Precise, instead.
