Q:

Removing a prefix from a Diagnostics Aggregator Group

I'm trying to configure a diagnostics aggregator, and all of the messages have names like name_of_robot/camera, name_of_robot/laser
Is there a way to remove all of those prefixes at once?
Edit: Sorry for the delay. Had to find the proper bag file.
I'd like to be able to group all messages with the same prefix, i.e. all messages from one robot namespace (p1_003 here). It seems like currently you can only find-and-remove prefixes for the generic analyzer, not for an entire group.
Here is a sample laser message.

A:

Are you trying to remove these prefixes from the input to the aggregator, or its output?
If they're not present on the input, but they are showing up on the output, you may want to look at your aggregator config to see if there's a top-level AggregatorGroup that's set to your robot name.
If you can post a sample message from the /diagnostics topic and your aggregator config, that would help.
