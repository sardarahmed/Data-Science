Q:

Error when trying to rosrun turtlebot_dashboard. Any ideas?

Hello.
I'm trying to set up my Turtlebot for the first time.
I'm following the tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/TurtleBot%20Bringup and everything is successful until the following:
turtlebot@turtlebot-laptop:~/ros/turtlebot/turtlebot_bringup/upstart$ rosrun turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard&
[2] 19832

A:

I think there could be a problem with the way you installed ROS. Did you do a source based installation or apt-get install ros-electric-turtlebot-viz?
Check that $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set to /opt/ros/electric/stacks and also to your workspace.
Add the line

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/electric/stacks:(your_path)

to your .bashrc file
replace (your_path) with ~/ros_workspace if your ros_workspace directory is in your home directory.
