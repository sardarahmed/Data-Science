Q:

openni_node.launch: Warning: recursive print statement has occurred

Not sure if this is a problem or not.  On the latest version of the ni stack running on the latest Diamondback and Ubuntu 10.04, I get the following warnings when launching openni_node.launch:
$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
core service [/rosout] found
process[openni_node1-1]: started with pid [32041]
process[kinect_base_link-2]: started with pid [32042]

process[kinect_base_link2-4]: started with pid [32045]
process[kinect_base_link3-5]: started with pid [32056]

Warning: recursive print statement has occurred.  Throwing out recursive print.
Warning: recursive print statement has occurred.  Throwing out recursive print.
Warning: recursive print statement has occurred.  Throwing out recursive print.
Warning: recursive print statement has occurred.  Throwing out recursive print.
Warning: recursive print statement has occurred.  Throwing out recursive print.

The warning always repeats 5 times as above.  The Kinect and the node seem to be working fine, just thought I would report it.

I've got this too. 10.10 on a VirtualBox machine running ontop of ATI video card.

Thanks for the report.  This sort of thing can go directly into a ticket like this one.  https://kforge.ros.org/openni/Trac/ticket/1
