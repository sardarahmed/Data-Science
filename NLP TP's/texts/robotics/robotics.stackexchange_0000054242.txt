Q:

services running in a node

Hello
I was wondering if its possible to get a list of all services to which a node is connected, either as a client or as a server.
Somethis similar to ros::this_node::getSubscribedTopics()
http://docs.ros.org/electric/api/roscpp/html/namespaceros_1_1this__node.html#a81620bbd1e0a3196d694c38fbd4dea8a
Also, is it possible to know which parameters a node has read.
Thanks
Miguel Oliveira

Hi everyone
I found a workaround for this one.
I use the shell
ros service list api from ros.
To make a system call and then get back the result I use ipstream library.
Perhaps it is helpfull for someone.
PS: I just did not find a way to get the client services a node is connected to ...

Hi Miguel,
You need to call getSystemState(caller_id) from the ROS XMLRPC Master API, and it returns a list of all the subscribers, publishers, and services. The Master API documentation URL: wiki.ros.org/ROS/Master_API
Thanks,
Aaron

Your welcome! There are multiple deficiencies in the API related to Services. Including the inability to obtain the Service Topic Type, and the inability to request MD5 information for Topics/Services.
