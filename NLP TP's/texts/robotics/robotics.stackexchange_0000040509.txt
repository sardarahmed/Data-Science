Q:

Failed to find rosdep

Hi,
I have copied the gsl package into my ros workspace, it appears in rospack list, but I'm getting this warnings:
Failed to find rosdep gsl for package my_package on OS:ubuntu version:lucid
WARNING: Rosdeps [u'gsl'] could not be resolved

[ rosmake ] WARNING: Rosdep did not detect the following system dependencies as installed: gsl Consider using --rosdep-install option or `rosdep install my_package`

However it compiles and works ok, but there is probably something wrong? Can you halp to get rid of this warnings?
Thanks

A:

In my_package's manifest.xml change
<rosdep name="gsl" />

to
<depend package="gsl" />

Thanks, but actually in my_package the depend was correct but in the gsl package there was  so I have change it to  and it works.

Ah. Glad to hear it wasn't too tricky. There seem to be some strange issues with rosdep these days.
