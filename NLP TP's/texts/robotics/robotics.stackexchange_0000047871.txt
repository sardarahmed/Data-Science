A:

Try rostopic echo /camera/depth/points .. if u seen data is being transferred then u might have to adjust some settings in rviz related to tf..

Can u elaborate problem with tf. Use tf_echo to check transformation between frame_id of camera_depth_points and constant frame like map/world  or maybe odom. Are u seeing points when u echo /camera/depth/points??
