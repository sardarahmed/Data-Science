Q:

Navigation ideas

Hello,
I am new to navigation and currently I have a wheeled robot and I want to implement various navigation algorithms with it. For now though, I don't have an odometer for localization and I currently use only a lidar. I have managed to do some obstacle avoidance with it, but I am out of ideas for now.
If you could help me with some navigation algorithms that don't require an odometer for localization, I would be more than happy to hear them.
Thank you for your answers and for your time in advance,
Chris

hello
i am new to ros and trying to use navigation stack for obstacle avoidance. how did you manage obstacle avoidance?

A:

Hello, I'm not sure if it is what you want but you can use the SLAM for localization.
You can use hector_mapping (hector_slam), I know it is possible to use it without odometry.
There is also another algorithm for SLAM: slam_gmappping (gmapping) but I don't know if it is possible to use it without odometry.
You can find all the information about those 2 methods on the ros wiki (by typing hector_slam and gmapping).
I hope it will help you,
lfr
