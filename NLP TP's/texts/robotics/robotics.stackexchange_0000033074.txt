Q:

From Laserscan to obstacle avoidance

I have got the laser scan from the kinect using the openni_driver. Now i would like to use it for obstacle avoidance. For obstacle avoidance, i am using vector field histogram. Any suggestions or directions i could take?

A:

This question is overly generic.  Please take a look at the navigation stack There are lots of tutorials and documentation on how to use the existing implementations to do path planning with obstacle avoidance.

I would like to explain in more in detail. I am putting a kinect camera on UAV and using it for obstacle avoidance. Hence, the UAV has no sonar and odometer. I am using VFH to do obstacle avoidance.I have downloaded the vfh.cc to do obstacle avoidance but not really sure how to use it...

You could adhere to the base local planner interface when writing your VFH implementation in order to take advantage of all the other components the navigation stack has to offer. You may find the nav_core package interesting: http://www.ros.org/wiki/nav_core
