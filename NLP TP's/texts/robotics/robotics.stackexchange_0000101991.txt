Q:

Creating api or shareable library on ros2

Hi,
I have my ros2 workspace on my device but when I send that device all my code is viewable and can be copied. I am trying to make my workspace private by making it a shareable library or .so files or by creating an API file. Not sure if that's the right way or even a way to do that or if it's a better way that can satisfy my needs.
I really appreciate any help you can provide.
Thanks in advance.

A:

You could (1) distribute binaries (2) ship the robot with just the install space (there's no need to give them a workspace) or (3) use Snaps
But there are far more options than just those, just some of the ones on top of mind

Thanks for the reply,
Most of the packages are in python and if I just ship with install it contains all my code. This doesn't happen with CPP files or packages.
Is it possible for you to provide some resources that you used?
Thanks again.

There are code obfuscation tools for Python, but I don't specifically have experience with them, I assumed this referred to C++ since you refer to .so files.
