Q:

Gazebo Hardware Requirement

I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ROS Hydro. I installed Gazebo 1.9 and executed initial mobile robot tutorials with SDF. But my system gets very slow while running Gazebo. I have 1GB RAM with Intel Pentium (R) Dual CPU E2200@ 2.20 GHz*2.
My motherboard is: ASUS P5KPL-AM EPU. Is there a minimum requirement for CPU and RAM while running Gazebo? What is that? Should I increase my RAM?

A:

You can better ask this question at http://answers.gazebosim.org/
But both your RAM and cpu are probably at the minimum. More ram would help but the CPU is also a bit slow.
