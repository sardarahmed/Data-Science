Q:

How can I get the positions data of every joint?

Hi everyone,
I am doing arm trajectory planning.
Now I am using motion_planning_rviz_plugin to display the trajectory of the arm. First I wrote program reference to link text and then RVIZ subscribe the topic "joint_path_display".
I can display the trajectory just like the picture  !
Now I want to get the  position data of every joints which I circled with red colour on the image.
How can I get the position information of every joint?
Thanks in advance

A:

Set up a tf::TransformListener (http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/tf/html/c++/classtf_1_1TransformListener.html ) from the tf package ( http://wiki.ros.org/tf ) or tf2::BufferCore ( http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/tf2/html/classtf2_1_1BufferCore.html ) from the tf2 package ( http://wiki.ros.org/tf2 ) --  depending on which tf version you use / your ROS distro supports and use the function lookupTransform ( http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/tf/html/c++/classtf_1_1Transformer.html#a14536fe915c0c702534409c15714aa2f  or http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/tf2/html/classtf2_1_1BufferCore.html#a362de8ea45b99efde65bcc602053ad38 ) .................

Thank you, I will try to do what you have suggested. I am using Fuerte.

then it'd be tf not tf2

Thank you very much, I am using  planning of motion_planning_rviz_plugin to display the pose of every joint, I am wondering if I can get pose information directly from motion_planning_rviz_plugin::planning?
Thank you
