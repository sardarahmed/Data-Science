Q:

Ros Canopen PositionJointInterface working with mode 3?

Hi, I try to control my robot arm by ros canopen but the driver do not have Interpolated Position Mode which is mode 7.
I follow the canopen_test_utils example and it use mode 3 for position controller, but I got error as
[ERROR] [1516324623.132823131]: hardware_interface::PositionJointInterface cannot be provided in mode 3
[ERROR] [1516324623.132886958]: Could not switch controllers. The hardware interface combination for the requested controllers is unfeasible.
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1516324623.133238] Failed to start controllers: joint_trajectory_pid_controller

So I just wonder can I use Profiled Velocity Mode for PositionJointInterface
?

Ok, I see, Thanks for ur help.

A:

The Profiled velocity mode does not offer hardware_interface::PositionJointInterface, but hardware_interface::VelocityJointInterface.
That's why you have to use velocity_controllers/JointTrajectoryController with proper PID settings.
