Q:

How does time influence moveit motion planning?

Hello all,
I just got started with ROS and moveit! to make my robot arm plan some movements. Ultimately I would like to optimize the speed of the executed movements by tuning the actuator's PID parameters. However, I noticed that moveit also keeps track of the time it takes to execute a motion. Now I worry that moveit factors in time somehow when it decides what trajectory to follow for the motion plannning, which would lead to it planning different motion trajectories when I start optimizing my PID's/execution time. I looked around on the internet but couldn't find any information about this.
So my question is: Does the motion execution time influence the planned trajectory of moveit? What influence does time have here?
Thank you for answering in advance!

If you're using the default planner (ie: OMPL), then it doesn't.
OMPL finds paths, not trajectories.

Thank you for your reply! I'm using set_pose_target() function from MoveIt! and the FollowJointTrajectory control for all the actuators. Is it still a path if I use OMPL in that way?

OMPL plans paths, not trajectories. It doesn't matter which way you ask Moveit to plan it, in the end it's OMPL (unless you've configured a different planner to be used).

Thanks a lot, it's much clearer now!

@gvdhoorn does any of the current planners in Moveit set velocities/accelerations for the joints or is this done in post-processing with e.g. Iterative Parabolic Time Parameterization or Iterative Spline Parameterization?

@gvdhoorn I think it is still relevant for this question. But the path returned by .plan() of the moveit commander returns a message of the type: http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/trajectory_msgs/html/msg/JointTrajectoryPoint.html . How does the time_from_start get involved if ompl doesn't return it. This link also point to the time dependency of the moveit commander functions: https://books.google.nl/books?id=wY2RCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA353&vq=trajectory&hl=nl&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false

@funky_watermelon I think that is a very valid point and I'm interested to hear what @gvdhoorn thinks!

It may be relevant, but it's a different question (which I believe also has already been answered).
The OP's question was: "how does timing information influence path planning?"
Your question is: "where does the time info even come from?"
Those are two different questions, and accordingly, should be asked in different posts.
