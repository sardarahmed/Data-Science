Q:

libuvc_ros not building

Hello,
I'm trying to use this package thero: http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera
But I get this error when I do catkin_make:
    CMake Error at libuvc_ros-master/libuvc_camera/CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibuvc.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "libuvc", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libuvc" with any
  of the following names:

    libuvcConfig.cmake
    libuvc-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libuvc" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libuvc_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "libuvc"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

See also "/home/paulo/catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log".
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

Is this my fault or are there missing config files in this package?

A:

Have you run rosdep to check that you have all package dependencies installed?

Also: that package has been released for Hydro, so if you can, I'd install the binary version (ros-hydro-libuvc-camera).
