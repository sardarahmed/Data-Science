Q:

using oni files in openni_camera node

Hallo,
I've tried to get the .oni files as input instead of the camera by changing the initialization to the way the NiViewer example works with the xml file (status = context_.InitFromXmlFile(SAMPLE_XML_PATH, &errors);) . It works when selecting input sources from the camera that way, but when giving an .oni file with rgb and depth streams in I get this error:
[31m[ERROR] [1298297598.491463836]: [OpenNIDriver::spin] Error in switching on depth stream registration: This operation is invalid![0m
[31m[ERROR] [1298297599.031286629]: [OpenNIDriver::spin] Error in switching on depth stream registration: This operation is invalid![0m
[31m[ERROR] [1298297599.031449831]: [OpenNIDriver::spin] Error in switching on depth stream registration: This operation is invalid![0m

Same settings work fine with NiViewer but I seem to be missing something to get it to work in the openni_camera node but I don't see it.
Any idea's what I'm missing?

A:

The openni_cameara node is designed to read from the device and output ROS messages.  As far as I know it doesn't have support for ONI recording or playback.  If you want, you can make a feature request of it at https://kforge.ros.org/openni/Trac/newticket?component=openni_kinect&keywords=openni_camera&type=enhancement
