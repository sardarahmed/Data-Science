Q:

Extraction of features from rviz map

Hello,
In my project, I am required to evaluate accuracy of rviz map generated using GMapping algorithm on a robotino. I need to develop a repeatable method to extract features (not the 'measure' tool in rviz) and determine the distance between them on the map and compare it to measured real-world distances. How do I go about extracting the features from an rviz map?

A:

You can interpret the map as an image and do standard image processing on it, for example using OpenCV. This way, you can run different feature detectors/descriptors on the map and use those. An example of doing exactly that is provided in the mapstitch package that allows aligning maps which each other. The code for converting a map to a cv:Mat is here.

Thank you. So I take the stored rviz map and run the code (that converts to a cv:Mat), this will give me an image, then I run image processing algorithms using OpenCV, have I understood it right? What is the usage of the mapstitch package?

The mapstitch package performs feature detection on two (different) maps. estimates the relative transform between them and generates a stitched/fused map from both.

Thanks. I will try it out.
