Q:

error with rostopic echo -p

Hi Everyone,
After upgrading to Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04, I'm having issues saving rostopic data to a .csv using the '-p' option.
The topics echo and bag fine, but when I try to out it into plot friendly format it gives me this error (up to about 20 times):
File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rostopic/__init__.py", line 940, in callback
    self.suffix + '\n')
TypeError: _str_plot() got an unexpected keyword argument 'value_transform'

Has anyone seen this before?
Thanks,
Andrew
