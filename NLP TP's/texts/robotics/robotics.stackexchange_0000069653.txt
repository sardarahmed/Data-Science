Q:

Unify parameters names for local planner

Plugin dwa_local_planner uses path_distance_bias/goal_distance_bias/occdist_scale, but base_local_planner uses pdist_scale/gdist_scale/occdist_scale with the same semantics.
the configuration for some robots, as Turtlebot : it uses base_local_planner but sets dwa_local_planner parameters.
https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_apps/blob/indigo/turtlebot_navigation/param/dwa_local_planner_params.yaml
Something similar happens with other parameters min_in_place_rotational_vel/min_in_place_vel_theta or max_rotational_vel/max_vel_theta
so which ı used parameter names are important for planners ?

A:

This is where namespaces are very useful, when setting the parameters, say in a launch file you can group things
    <group ns="some-namespace">
        <param ....>
        ...
    </group> 

This way, even if some parameters have similar names, every node gets the right params
