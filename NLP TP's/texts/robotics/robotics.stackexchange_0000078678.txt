Q:

soem_core CATKIN_IGNORED? Beckhoff IOs

Hi all,
I am trying to compile this package: git clone https://github.com/orocos/rtt_soem.git (from the tutorials)
It seems soem_core is deprecated. May I know where is the new soem_core?
Better still, how can I utilize Beckhoff IOs using ROS?
Regards,
Walter.

Hey Guys,
I'm also facing problems with the SOEM-Package. I Want to communicate with Beckhoff IOs via EtherCAT using ROS. Walter, did it work for you?
Thanks in advance, Philipp

A:

I deprecated soem_core in favor of the more up to date soem from https://github.com/smits/soem.git adding this to your catkin workspace should make it work (catkin_make_isolated/catkin install as soem is a plane cmake package).  The latest  rtt_soem should work fine with this newer version.
