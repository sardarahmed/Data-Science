Q:

Complaint from openni_launch on already advertised services

[ERROR] [1323213598.693718118]: Tried
to advertise a service that is already
advertised in this node
[/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/compressed/set_parameters]
[ERROR] [1323213598.725968778]: Tried
to advertise a service that is already
advertised in this node
[/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/theora/set_parameters]/image_rect_raw/theora/set_parameters]

This appears after the processes have started up when I run.

roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

What am I doing wrong here?
Thanks in advance.

Maybe a previous run had not shut down completely? Was roscore still running from before?

A:

You are not doing anything wrong. This is a bug with plugins to image_transport - under the right conditions their dynamic_reconfigure services can collide, producing those errors. It's ticketed at https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4883 .
The error output is annoying but in practice doesn't cause much harm, so this has been a low-priority item.
