Q:

Which is the frame used by Gmapping for the camera topic?

Hi!
My robot always end up to loose himself "Deleting nodes..." and I suspect a problem with Gmapping.
I would like to know how to determine which is the frame used by Gmapping for the camera topic. Documentation says :

Required tf Transforms

<the frame attached to incoming scans> â†’ base_link"

But how do I know what frame is attached to a particular topic?
I use an Asus Xtion and the package Depth Image to Laserscan.
Many thanks :-)

A:

The frame_id field in the header for each message indicates which frame the data is attached to.
You can see the header as part of the output from rostopic echo /topic, or if you want to see just the header on /topic, you can use rostopic echo /topic/header.
