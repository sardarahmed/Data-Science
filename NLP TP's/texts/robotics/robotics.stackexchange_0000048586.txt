Q:

ROS launch dependency checker

Is there a tool that can be used to check that launch dependencies and other non-compile time dependencies are met.  I always have the problem where I fail to make all the packages that are required for a launch file, because the package isn't referenced in the manifest/package.xml.  If the package isn't referenced, rosmake will work correctly but calling the launch file will not.  This is especially problematic for releases.  Ideally a released package would have all dependencies, build, launch, plugins, anything else?

A:

I like to include rosbuild_add_roslaunch_check() in my unit tests.
It statically checks that the specified launch files only use packages with an explicit dependency.
