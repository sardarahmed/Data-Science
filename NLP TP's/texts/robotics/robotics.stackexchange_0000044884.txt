A:

Gazebo is a 3D rigid-body physics simulator (including a graphical interface).
rviz is a tool for 3D visualization of data from other ROS nodes as well as some support for sending commands to other ROS nodes.

Does rviz can show me as a simulation what robot thinking about now such as different paths to grasp a cup before actually ground it to robot specific hardware ?!

rviz can show you anything that it has a plugin for displaying and has been published by your nodes. You can find a list of DisplayTypes here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/DisplayTypes

I'm not 100% sure I get what you're asking. rviz can show you anything you publish that it knows how to show. It does not do any sort of inference on it's own. For example, if you wanted to see N possible plans from a planner at time t, your planning node would have to publish all N plans to rviz.
