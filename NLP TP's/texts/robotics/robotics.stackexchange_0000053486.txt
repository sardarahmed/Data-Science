Q:

launch file to run nodes on multiple machines

I am trying to write a lunch file to run a node on my turtlebot robot and visualizes the results in rviz on my workstation. To start the turtlebot I like to include the minimal.launch file which is located on the turtlebot.
The launch file I am writing is on the workstation.
Can someone help me to configure the "include    " statement to let the launch file know that minimal.launch is located on the turtlebot. the "include" command doesnot have "machine=..." option.
What does this mean "You can also use the $(env ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE) syntax within include tags to load in .launch files based on environment variables (e.g. MACHINE_NAME)."
Also, do you have a launch file to do what is state in : Talker / listener across two machines
