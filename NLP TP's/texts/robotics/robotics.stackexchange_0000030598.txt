Q:

retrieve raw IR image from Kinect

Is there anyway to retrieve the raw IR image using the openni_kinect stack? Any other stack?
I'm pretty sure the old kinect calibration that was part of a different stack and that used a different driver published the raw IR image but it seems like the old calibration tutorial was taken down.

Right now, we dont publish the IR images, but this feature is on our ToDo list, espectially with the calibration routines.
