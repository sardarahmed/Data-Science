Q:

bt_navigator failing with error `Action server failed while executing action callback: "send_goal failed"`

I am using

ROS2 Foxy

Nav2 for navigation

Slam-toolbox for mapping and localization

create_robot for odom

When I send a command to the ActionService navigate_to_pose from Nav2, most of the time bt_navigator will fail with the error:
[bt_navigator-9] [ERROR] [1627933160.614862066] [bt_navigator]: Action server failed while executing action callback: "send_goal failed"
[bt_navigator-9] [WARN] [1627933160.615170308] [bt_navigator]: [navigate_to_pose] [ActionServer] Aborting handle.
As far as I can tell, I am calling the Service correctly and my issue might be with my configuration.
My config for nav2 can be found here: https://pastebin.com/KkRUAB5s
I have also thrown all logs from this specific run into a pastebin here: https://pastebin.com/Rx1ZMUeg
the error in question can be found on lines 428 & 429

A:

As per https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/2272#issuecomment-880879354, best solution would be to switch from Foxy to Galactic, this solved issue for me.
