Q:

URDF File - robot jumps and makes small leaps

Hello,
I want to create a robot with two driving wheels and two caster wheels.  As shown in this image :

I dâ€™not know if it is well showen in the picture, the robot has two caster wheels (front and rear).
I have create the URDF file that describes the robot, unfortunately I have some small problems that I do not know how to fix them.
URDF file link : https://gist.github.com/hdd-robot/2d334c53aaa3b7366b96249964bbfead
The problem is that the robot jumps and makes small leaps, which makes the odometry imprecise and it is very unpleasant.
Thanks in advance.

A:

So, the problem comes from the acceleration that is too much.
I also create a separate links for front caster wheel and back caster wheel.
