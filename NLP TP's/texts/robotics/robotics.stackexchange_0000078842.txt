apt-get is telling you that it doesn't understand what you want, as ros-indigo-cmvision is not an apt-get command.
The correct command would be:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-cmvision

note the install there.
But in this case that is not going to work either, as cmvision has not been released for anything but ROS Hydro (note the lack of any mention of any other ROS release on the wiki page). If you still want to use the package, you'll have to build it from sources. See #q252478 for some info on how to do that. kbogert/cmvision/indigo-devel appears to be a fork of the original cmvision package that has been updated to work on ROS Indigo.
