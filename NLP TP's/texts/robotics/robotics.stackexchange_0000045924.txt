Q:

ROS and MatLab support, IPC-Bridge

Hello
So far as I know ROS does not support MatLab. I wonted to use online MatlAb with ROS. So to subscribe or publish a ROS topic to Matlab. For example I have calculated some parameters with ROS and wont online to import some MAtLab function, like find the minimum value of the ROS output parameters. Till now the only way was to save the parameters in a txt file and later on offline use MatLab. I found that exist IPC-Bridge package to communicate with ROS. Is the communication online??Im using ROS Fuerte and Ubuntu 10.4. IS IPC-Bridge supported on ROS Fuerte and Ubuntu 10.04??IS there any tutorial how to install, use and some example??
Thanks

A:

If by online you mean communication with a running MATLAB instance, then yes online communication is permitted.
See the page here that provides examples and instructions..
