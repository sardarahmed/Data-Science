Problem with launching the gazebo

Hi everyone,
I'm a new user in Gazebo, I had program to launch the gazebo in my Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS 64bit system. It will stuck at preparing your world. It's this due to my computer's problem or some configuration problem?

A:

The first time you launch Gazebo, it tries to download some models from the internet. If you wait a while it will eventually start.

How long do you have to wait? I have the same problem and have been waiting for hours.

It usually depends on your internet connection, but I don't think it should ever wait for hours.
