What versions of packages are you using? Is everything from debian packages or some from source?

i obtained the package from this source http://www.ros.org/wiki/clearpath_turtlebot ..... i have been able to resolve the error given above . now i am confronted with another error that is "no device connected" . just want to ensure whether it requires kinect or not.
Comment by qubaish g on 2013-04-15:
what i think , error is occurring because kinect is not connected to usb port .... also i want to ask is there any possibility to get kinect data from gazebo? .. have u run that package?

A:

Hello
Is you kinect camera hooked up to a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0? The Kinect does not work with a USB 3.0.
