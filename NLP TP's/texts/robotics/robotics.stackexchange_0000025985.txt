Q:

When importing a URDF model, how are package:// URIs parsed?

I'm using gzfactory to load a URDF in which mesh resources are specified using package://ros_package/relative/path URIs. Testing seems to indicate that Gazebo removes the package:// identifier and treats the remaining string as a relative filesystem path. Is this what's really going on under the hood?.
TIA

A:

Current solution for reading URDF models in Gazebo assumes the ROS package containing the model must also have a valid Gazebo model.config file in addition to the ROS manifest.xml file.  And the model must be in both GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH for both ROS and Gazebo to find the model.
With that assumption, package:// is simply replaced by model:// by parser_urdf.cc.
