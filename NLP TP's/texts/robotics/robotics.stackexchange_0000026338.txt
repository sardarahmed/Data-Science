Q:

DRC robot falls over in qualification worlds

Extracted from question 2665
When the simulator does actually launch, about 60% of the time, as soon the counter starts running and the atlas robot is initialized into the world, the atlas robot will immediately fall to the ground in a totally random direction without having received any input from the user, no input from any controller through rosrun, no input on keyboard or mouse, the atlas robot just falls in a random direction and crunches up.

What version of drcsim are you running?  Starting with drcsim 2.5.0, the Atlas robot starts in BDI Stand mode, which should keep it standing.

I am running drcsim 2.5. I have tried on both an Intel Card and an NVIDIA Card and it will sometimes fall over immediately after spawning.

Update
should be fixed in this pull request.

Hi,  If
roslaunch atlas_utils qual_task_1.launch

produces a fallen robot on startup, can you please send us the state log for debugging?
/tmp/qual_task_1/state.log

thanks.

logs for 3 falls and 3 stands are at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/q1fall/ If you want more or with another version of drcsim running (or from another type of machine), just let us know.
