Q:

Can I make a simple Bluetooth receiver?

I can control a relay from an Android smartphone using Arduino and Bluetooth as seen here.
However, it seems too costly to be using Arduino and a Bluetooth receiver for driving a switch. As long as Bluetooth is a radio frequency, is it possible to make a simple Bluetooth receiver which can output 1 or 0 to drive a relay? If yes, how tough that is going to be?
The main factor here is the cost, which should be \$1-$5. 

A:

I'm in agreement with @movrev but wanted to expand beyond the scope of a comment.  RN-42 is slick.  I'm coding for it now, and I think it is an excellent BT choice.
Low cost and multiple receivers (switches) appear to be mutually exclusive.  You might consider the RN-42 as a BT receiver to preserve smartphone interface.  Then, you might consider an 802.15 (Zigbee) mesh-like solution to distribute a switch command from the RN-42 "master" receiver to the "slave" switches.  The Microchip MRF24J40 is a reasonable 802.15 solution.

A:

The question is a bit vague, but I would say that you at least need to spend ~$16 in a Bluetooth receiver. I have experience with roving networks modules, such as the RN42, which are easy to set up as wireless serial ports (you can talk to them via pyserial or the like).
