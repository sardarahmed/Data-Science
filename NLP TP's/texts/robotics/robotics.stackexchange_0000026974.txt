Q:

How to get center of gravity coordinates of a robot?

Can anyone tell me how to get center of gravity coordinates of a robot in gazebo?
I'm controlling 10DOF robot and would like to see the CoG trajectory as the robot moves.
I found "getcog" in the API, but don't know how to use it.
Please share some nice ways to do this. Thank you.

A:

There is no convenience function to get the CoG of a whole robot. You'll have to iterate over all the links in the robot, get the CoG, and compute the overall CoG.
Get all links in a model
Get the interial properties of a link
Get the CoG
