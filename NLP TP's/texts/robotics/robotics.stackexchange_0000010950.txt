Q:

In vision based localization, is it possible to make multiple vehicles cooperate to improve the estimation of each other?

I am currently working on a project that involves structure from motion using multiple cameras on multiple aerial vehicles (each vehicle has a monocular camera: think of it as a distributed stereo), and I am trying to extend this to include localization as well. My pipeline currently goes: robots at known locations -> take pictures -> reconstruct.
When it comes to localizing the vehicles as well using this incrementally built map, the standard approach that comes to mind is to apply the PNP algorithm on each camera (assuming the reconstructed scene is visible to all cameras) which results in the 3D pose: but this doesn't necessarily take advantage of the fact that multiple cameras exist, apart from the fact that they are used in reconstructing the environment. Is there anything I can exploit using multiple cameras/vehicles that would result in enhanced localization accuracy of all of the vehicles as compared to a "single vehicle performing PNP on a known map" scenario?

A:

You can do it by fusion using a Kalman filter:
You have a process model model:
$$
x_t = g(x_{t-1},u_t)
$$
Now, you have multiple measurements of the same process model from different perspectives:
$$
z1_t = h_1(x_{t}) \leftarrow \text{camera 1} \\
z2_t = h_2(x_{t}) \leftarrow \text{camera 2} \\
\cdots \\
zn_t = h_n(x_{t}) \leftarrow \text{camera n} \\
$$
In the prediction step of the Kalman filter, nothing changes you have only one process:
$$
\bar{x}_t = g(x_{t-1},u_t) \\
\bar{\Sigma}_t = G_t \Sigma_{t-1} G_t^\intercal + R_t
$$
And for the update step, you have to include all the measurements:
$$
K_t = \bar{\Sigma}_t H_t^\intercal ( H_t \bar{\Sigma}_t H_t^\intercal + Q_t )^{-1} \\
x_t = \bar{x}_t + K_t ( z_t - h( \bar{x}_t ) ) \\
\Sigma_t = ( I - K_t H_t ) \bar{\Sigma}_t 
$$
The trick is defining how you are building the matrices in the update step:
$$
z_t = \left[ \begin{array}{c} z1_t \\ z2_t \\ \cdots \\ zn_t \end{array} \right]
$$
$$
h(\bar{x}_t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} h_1(\bar{x}_t) \\ h_2(\bar{x}_t) \\ \cdots \\ h_n(\bar{x}_t) \end{array} \right]
$$
$$
H_t = \left[ \begin{array}{c} H1_t \\ H2_t \\ \cdots \\ Hn_t \end{array} \right]
$$
$$
Q_t = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} Q1_t & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & Q2_t & 0 & 0 \\ \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & Qn_t \end{array} \right]
$$
