Q:

teb_local_planner development status

Hey guys,
I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but I would like to know if the local planner "teb_local_planner" will be further developed?
Most of the commits were in 2016 and minor changes in 2017. The reason I am asking this is that I am using the planner at the moment (works pretty well) and just wanted to know if there will be new features in 2018?
The best person to answers this would be @croessmann (thank you for all your great work) probably.
Thank you guys in advance!

Hi,
yeah, there are still some unanswered issues and pull requests for the package.
Unfortunately, I had not much spare-time during the last months to address these issues and to further provide some improvements.
I am going to try to spend some time on improving the planner and check all the pull requests during the next weeks.
I also have some ideas which would require a major update on the code, I will see what I can get in soon.
Cheers,
Christoph

Thank you very much for the fast answer, sounds great. I thought you might have finished your research on this topic. The underlying trajectory control in the planner is a model predictive control isn‘t it? Do you have any book recommendations on this topic? I really want to get a deep understanding

I have read most  of your conference paper on this topic but it’s a little bit hard for me to understand everything. Maybe you have a good hint for me to get deeper in this topic (my background is computer engineering with two semesters control theory). Thank you very much in advance!
