Q:

unresolvable dependency conflict in ros-hydro-desktop ubuntu raring

I'm having trouble installing ros-hydro on ubuntu raring. I've followed the instructions on wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu. When I get to the installation step I run
~$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop full

but I get the following error
~$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full 
Reading package lists... Done

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-desktop-full : Depends: ros-hydro-desktop but it is not going to be installed
                          Depends: ros-hydro-simulators but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Edit: more info:
It appears that many of the ros-hydro packages depend on libbost-all-dev which is a meta package depending on libboost-[library]1.53-dev. However ros-hydro-desktop depends on gazebo which depends on libogre-dev which depends on libboost-[date-time|thread]1.49-dev. In other words we have the following dependency graph:
libboost-<X>1.49-dev --x-- libboost-<X>1.53-dev
    |                       |
libogre-dev                libboost-<X>-dev
    |                       |
gazebo                     libboost-all-dev
    |                       |
   ...                     ros-hydro-<SEE_LIST> 
    |                     /
    |                    /
    |                   /

A:

You have something weird with your packages on your machine.  libboost-all-dev in Raring is 1.49: http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/libboost-all-dev
I think you might have Saucy sources on your computer. It has 1.53 http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/libboost-all-dev

Thanks for the suggestion. It seems you're right. I don't have Saucy sources, but I do have the ubuntu-toolchain-r/test ppa, which I've added in order to get gcc-4.8. By running apt-cache policy libboost-dev I see that it provides boost 1.53. It's always the last place you look...
