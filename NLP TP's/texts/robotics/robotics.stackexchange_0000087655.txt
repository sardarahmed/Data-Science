Q:

How to change map origin of rtabmap?

Hi.
I'm using rtabmap and rtabmap_ros as localization mode to recognize robot's global pose.
To make my map simplify, I want to change map origin from pose which odometry started to desired pose. Is there any way to do this?

A:

You could add a static_transform_publisher to add a transform prior to /map in TF tree. For example, if you want to change map origin from 5 meters, you may publish /world -> /map with such transform.
