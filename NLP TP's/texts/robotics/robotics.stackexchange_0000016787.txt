Q:

A* search results in path too close to obstacles

I have a configuration space as below with several obstacles. Green circles are all the points I need to go to. Blue line is the path returned from A* search. 
However, I am looking for path that's smoother and away from obstacles. what can I do?

A:

Obstacle padding/ robot padding.
Suppose you are working in a 2D environment and that you have an obstacle of the size 2x2. When doing planning (graph search, etc.), you increase the size of the obstacle to, for example, 3x3. Then when you find a path, the path is guaranteed to be at least of the distance 1 away from the actual obstacle.
As for a smoother path, you may apply some shortcutting procedure on the path found by your path planner. Searching for shortcutting or trajectory shortcutting should give you a number of results.

A:

Most planning algorithms reduce your robot to a point and plan a path for that point. The arising problem is exaclty what you are facing. As suggested before, obstacle padding is one of the methods, but generally, the configuration space has been proposed to solve this problem. 
Configuration space is a more advanced and more general way of padding obstacles. The obstacles are enlarged by the dimentions of the robot, considering also the robot's orientation. A more detailed description can be found here.
In order to smooth your paths:

you can introduce penalties in A* for non-smooth portions of the path. However, since A* can only plan in discreet envionments, some degree of discontinuity will alwazs be present
you can use methods which take into account the dynamic limits of your system (dynamic window)
make A* plan an even more coarse path and fit splines on those waypoints to make sure that the obtained path is smooth
you can post-process the paths to smooth them out with a filter

Smoothing will introduce slight deviations in the path, so make sure to consider possible collisions after smoothing also.
