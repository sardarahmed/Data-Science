Q:

how to save the displaying map and plotted data in rviz on an image file

Hey All,
I use rviz for visualization of path planning. How do I save the displaying map and plotted paths traversed by the robot on an image file like png or jpeg? I need to import the plotted data on the map from rviz to my paper as an image.
Thanks,
