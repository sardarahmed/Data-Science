Q:

Deducing single wing plane transfer function Aka Transfer function estimation through set of points

I'm trying to control a plane via roll  using PID controller , 
I had a problem finding the transfer function thus I used the following method :- 

Fix the plane in an air tunnel 
change the motor that controls the roll in fixed steps and check the
  roll 
thus I will have a table of roll/motor degree 
next is to deduce the nonlinear function using wolfram alpha or
  approximation neural network  .

Is this a correct method or should I try another method ? 

A:

You're correct that measurement and modeling is the right way to go about this.
For your PID to work properly, you need to be able to make a somewhat linear conversion of error (desired roll vs actual roll) into corrective force (in this case, provided by the control surfaces -- the aileron angle, influenced by air speed and other factors). 
The $k_d$ term of your PID should account for the inertia of the plane in rolling from side to side, so don't worry about that in your measurements.
What you should measure in your wind tunnel tests is the torque on the longitudinal axis of the plane, in response to airspeed (in both X and Y axes, if you have on-board sensors for that) and aileron angle.  That will provide data on the following relationship:
$$
\tau_{actual} = f(\theta_{\text{aileron}}, \text{airspeed}_x, \text{airspeed}_y, \text{[other measurable factors]})
$$
You are going to approximate the inverse of that function -- finding $\theta_{\text{aileron}}$ given $\tau_{desired}$.  Whether you do that with a neural network, wolfram alpha, multivariate regression, or a  good knowledge of physics is up to you.  In the end, you want to produce a modeling function in this form:
$$
\theta_{\text{aileron}} = f(\tau_{desired}, \text{airspeed}_x, \text{airspeed}_y, \text{[other measurable factors]})
$$
The PID will give you $\tau_{desired}$, and your sensors will give you the other factors to plug into this function.
