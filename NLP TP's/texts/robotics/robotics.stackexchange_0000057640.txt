Q:

ros.org downtime?

Hi all,
It seems that for a couple of times when I try to load ros.org (incl wiki, answers, etc), I get a 'not found' error. It was like the website is offline or something. Sorry I forgot the actual error.
Is it just me or is this common? The last time I had this was the whole day yesterday (around 9am - 5pm Malaysian time, GMT+8).

A:

They've been having some minor problems while upgrading the site, but I think those should be resolved.
The website status is available at http://status.ros.org/
