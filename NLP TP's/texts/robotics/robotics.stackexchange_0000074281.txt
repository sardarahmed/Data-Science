Q:

How does Voxel grid works?

How does voxel grid implementation works? I need more details, cant seems to visualize it.
Is there any other object avoidance method for mobile based? Thanks in advance :D

A:

More details than what? It's a 3D grid: A collection of aligned boxes: voxel grid http://developer94.openinventor.com/sites/default/files/imported/usersguide/images/VVOverview1.png.
It can be "implemented" using a 3D array in memory, but for voxel maps one usually uses an octree.
If you want to know more about voxel mapping see the page of the octomap library, where you will also find visualizations of voxel grids/maps.
You can also use meshes to query the closest point between two meshes (one is your robot model, the other part of the environment). But as far as I know, performance-wise these are limited to low amounts of polygons, i.e., not well suitable for meshes generated from sensor data.

How does it know if the cell is free, occupied and unknown space? BTW I'm new to ros. Thanks for the reply! Appreciate it :D

Raycasting. For more information about voxel mapping I recommend this publication.
