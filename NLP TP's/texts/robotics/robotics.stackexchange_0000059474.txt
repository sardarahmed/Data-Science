Q:

ROS hydro, moveit symbol lookup error

I tried to run pr2 moveit tutorials by launching "roslaunch pr2_moveit_config demo.launch"
But rviz start and died in few seconds and console gives following error.
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/rviz/rviz: symbol lookup error:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/libmoveit_planning_scene_monitor.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7console5printEPNS0_10FilterBaseEPvNS0_6levels5LevelEPKciS7_S7_z
I updated moveit plugin and tried, but problem remains and I am new to ROS and moveIt.
Please help.

A:

You should make sure all your ROS debians are up to date:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install ros-hydro-*

And then if you have a catkin workspace, I would rebuild it entirely by removing the build and devel directories and rebuilding.
