Q:

Is pointcloud compressable?

I'm using the PR2 and when I'm sending the date through the network I'm having lag problems. And for example, when I receive the image of one of the cameras, there's a topic in which the information is compressed (format: image_topic/compressed), and this way I can speed up things. So I would like to know if it's possible to do the pointcloud generated by the kinect in a compressed format. Or in other case, is there a launch file (or something like that) in which I can take the compressed image and depth image and convert them to pointcloud?

A:

Check out the compressed_depth_image_transport.
I think the Willow Garage interactive_manipulation pipeline and the oculus rift demo both make pretty heavy use of depth image compression to reduce the network bandwidth and lag problems.
You can take a look at the launch files for the PR2 Oculus Rift demo (pr2_surrogate) for an example of how to do this: https://github.com/ros-interactive-manipulation/pr2_surrogate/tree/groovy-devel/launch

@ahendrix  the problem is not the compressed image, I can use the compressed image, but how could I generate from those images (normal image and depth image) a pointcloud image.

Is your question: How to convert a depth image to a pointcloud?
