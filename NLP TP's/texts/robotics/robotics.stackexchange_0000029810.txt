Q:

Some problems about the ROS path

Hi,
My ROS has been installed at  /opt/ros/cturtles
/opt/ros/cturtle$ ls

it shows: jason  ros  setup.bash  setup.sh  setup.zsh  stacks
where the file of "jason" which I create, is to be contained myself packages.
Question1, could i create this file for including myself packages? I mean could i create this file under "cturtles" file, or "ros" file , or "stacks" file?
Question2,I create a package with 'roscreate-pkg', then I update my ros path.and the command is :
$ export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/cturtle/jason/:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

and then
$ rospack find ros_opencv   %ros_opencv is what i have created

but it shows
[rospack] warning: trailing slash found in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/opt/ros/cturtle/jason/ros_opencv
at the terminal, and the next time,I input the command
$ rospack find ros_opencv

it shows :[rospack] couldn't find package [ros_opencv]
why?
Best regards

A:

So it looks like you have an extra trailing slash at the end of /opt/ros/cturtle/jason/.  Try just using: export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/cturtle/jason:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Also, two more things: you may want to not place your own packages in /opt/.  It may be easier permission wise to place things in say: /home/jason/stacks
And don't forget that you can place the export command in your .bashrc (/home/your_name/.bashrc) so that you don't have to type it in every new terminal you open.
