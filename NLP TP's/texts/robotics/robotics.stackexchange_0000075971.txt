Q:

rqt_plot only showing 0

when I use rostopic echo to display the messages, the number fluctuates. While I rqt_plot to plot the data, those data are always zeros. The message type is correct and rqt_plot is indeed displaying the plot. I can see lines of different colours and correct coloured legends. Just the values are incorrect. Anyone got clue how this is happening?
I don't think the rqt_plot node is getting correct values from the topic.

Could you please add the type of the message you are trying to visualize? Does it have a header? If not, rqt_plot is not able to infer the time (the x-axis).

A:

Your Y-axis limits might be too large to reflect the small changes in your data.
Try zooming in on the graph.
