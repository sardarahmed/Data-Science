Q:

Import scene model into RVIZ/MoveIt

Hi all,
I am wanting to launch RVIZ and have it import laboratory environment into the planning scene.
I have a 3D model of the lab in SolidWorks and available as an STL.
How can I do this? Are there any parameters i can load this into?
Cheers

A:

@cmeaclem,
If, in Rviz, you navigate to the Motion Planning tab 'Scene Object' there is a window and button that lets you import a file. Once the file is loaded you can move your object in the world using the gui or imarkers and then save the config.
Hope this helps
Update: You can follow this to save the scene to the warehouse database. Then you can load from the same tab after launching. The connect button does need to be clicked a few times in order to connect and you may need to change the warehouse database path to save. From then on, you should just need to load the scene from the Motion Planning > Stored Scene tab.

So if I save the RViz configuration it will automatically load that scene next time I run my rviz application?

@cmeaclem Sorry, saving the Rviz configuration will save the display tabs that you have added to the left window pane. Handy, but not the answer I believe you need. See above for more accurate solution

Hello ! i have already imported file STL. However, the deviation is count on cm, i want it to use mm as the unit, can i fix this problem ? Thank you very much

@bao041115 I believe you can do this by scaling the object. I believe RVIZ uses meters by default, so scale this down/ up between the units.
