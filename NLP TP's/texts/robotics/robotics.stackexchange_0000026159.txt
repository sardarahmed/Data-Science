Q:

Gazebo model rotating itself

Hello,
I am new at Gazebo simulation. I define rotation axis in my model but my model is rotating itself (at wrong axis) that makes my robotic arm model really funny.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

Could you post your sdf file, and be a bit more explicit about the problem? Cheers

Thanks Andrei. Problem is solved by changing revolution type.

A:

I used revolute2 rotation type instead of revolute so when collision cloud collides it starts moving in other random directions.
Problem is sovled now =)
