Q:

does the OMPL package work for diamondback?

It comes by default with electric, but I can't seem to find it in diamondback version.
Thanks a lot

It's actually the ompl_ros_interface (the one contained in arm_navigation stack) which I can't find for diamondback

A:

There is a version of ompl in diamondback. See the ompl wiki page

Thanks! but I understand that ompl_ros_interface in the arm_navigation stack is the one that does the planning task, but if I install arm_navigation for diamondback (sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-arm-navigation), it doesn't come with the ompl_ros_interface package

There were significant changes and upgrades between diamondback and electric not all the features will be in both.
