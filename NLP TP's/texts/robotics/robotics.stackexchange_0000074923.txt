A:

If you mean "with apt-get", then you can't. The ROS repositories aren't set up that way, and only contain the latest version of the packages. Afaik, that is more a reprepro limitation than anything the OSRF has configured.
From source it can be done, but you'd have to know the exact versions of all the packages involved. Possible, but it'd be quite some effort.

For future readers: perhaps rosinstall_generator_time_machine can do this.
