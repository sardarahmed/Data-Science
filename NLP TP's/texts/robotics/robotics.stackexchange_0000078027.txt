Q:

Cannot download ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials

Making my way through this guide right here. Currently running Kinetic on the Raspbian Jessie Lite, which itself is running on the Raspberry Pi 3. So I'm trying to complete the pre-requisite which is the command:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials

However, whenever I try to install this, I get the error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials 

sudo can't locate ros-indigo or ros-jade either. In terms of the etc/apt/source.list.d/ros-latest.list, I have:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu jessie main  

I have done a sudo update and a sudo upgrade, but neither seems to work. I have noticed a lot of questions around with this problem, but can't seem to find a solution to my specific problem.

Update
After a suggestion from the two answers below, I have realised that I cannot use sudo-apt-get install on packages when I have built ROS-Kinetic from source. Now, I have tried running the four commands:
rosinstall_generator ros_comm ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar >kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall 

rosinstall_generator ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar >kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall 

rosinstall_generator ros_comm ros_kinetic_ros_tutorials --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar >kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall 

rosinstall_generator ros_kinetic_ros_tutorials --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar >kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall 

But I still get the error: The following not released packages stacks will be ignored: ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials.
What exactly am I doing wrong in trying to build this from source?

A:

There are instructions here to install extra packages in ROS Kinetic in the raspberry pi 3. Read the page carefully.
EDIT:
What you need to run is the following:
cd ~/ros_catkin_ws
rosinstall_generator ros_comm your_extra_packages --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
wstool merge -t src kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
wstool update -t src
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y -r --os=debian:jessie
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/kinetic

which from what I see, you probably tried it.
Ensure that the ROS repository is up to date, by following once again:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y python-rosdep python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool python-rosinstall build-essential cmake
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update

and then try the installation again. Also try to install another package for example ros_control and see if this works and the problem is only related to ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials.

As mentioned in the comment by ahendrix in his answer below:
"The ros-kinetic part of the apt package name is not part of the ROS package name. The ROS package is named ros_tutorials."

I've been battling with the same issue, and I'm personally attempting to install this package on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspbian (debian: buster). In the installation guide shown here, it's stated that rospack uses libboost1.58, rather than the automatically installed libboost1.67. Upon initial setup, the instructions prove to be correct and allow successful installation. at the moment you invoke
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y -r --os=debian:jessie'

after merging with wstool, libboost1.67 is installed again and creates more errors when building the catkin workspace. I believe that the package "ros_tutorials" is dependent on libboost1.67, which creates serious conflict.
