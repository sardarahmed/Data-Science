Q:

Camera sensor plugin publishing old frames

It seems that gazebo_ros_camera.so publishes camera frames with a lag of one update period, ie. a camera frame goes into ROS topic at the time the next frame is grabbed.
Our robot uses 3fps camera, which is fine in the real robot, but the simulations are not very useful, if the frames are > 1/3 s delayed.
Is there a fix for this issue?
The setup is ROS Groovy / Gazebo 1.2.5.

A:

I would try Gazebo 1.7.0. The sensor framework has been broken out into threads from Gazebo 1.5 onward.
