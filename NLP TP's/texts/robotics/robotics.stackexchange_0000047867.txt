Q:

roslocate info in ROS groovy

Hi,
I've been using ROS Fuerte since a few months.
Recently I've installed ROS Groovy to see what's new. Installation was no problem on my Ubuntu 12.10 system. However, I can not use 'roslocate info' for installing packages.
I usually installed stage, teleop_twist_keyboard, etc., with this method:
roslocate info stage | rosws merge - (then source setup.bash, and call rosws update).
Output on my system:
rope@computer:$ roslocate info stage
rosinstall malformed for package stage

A:

Yes, roslocate is not working very well at the moment. I believe this is a known problem, so please verify before opening another defect ticket.
EDIT: The source link on the stage wiki page suggests adding it to your workspace like this:
$ rosws set stage --svn https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/stage/trunk/
$ rosws update stage
