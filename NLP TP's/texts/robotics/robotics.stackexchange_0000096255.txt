Q:

Any issue with package format 3 in ros kinetic?

Are there any issues with using package.xml format 3 in ROS kinetic as long as the catkin version is up to date? Is any of the functionality not supported?

I'm not aware of any limitations or problems. Catkin versions are not really linked to ROS releases, so you should not have any problems using version 3 on Kinetic.
Have you run into anything?

I haven't had any issues yet, but I'm working on outlining a ROS2 upgrade for my project and it may depend on the new features of format 3 so I wanted to check and make sure.

A:

While there don't seem to be any specific recommendations on which distros support REP-149, catkin itself got upgraded to a format 3 package.xml in this PR into kinetic-devel in 2019: https://github.com/ros/catkin/pull/1025
