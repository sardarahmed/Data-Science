Q:

gazebo 1.9.1 : openni_kinect plugin does NOT refresh cabinet(-like) objects when move manually

I have a world where I move cabinet or similar objects (they have wood texture) and the gazebo_ros_openni_kinect driver doesn't refresh the data. It keeps seeing them even if they're no longer there in gazebo, when I point with the sensor to their old location.
This doesn't happen if I use the regular cube object.
You can see a video showing this issue here: http://youtu.be/wuyAfVP8Ohk
I'm using gazebo 1.9.1 and ros-hydro.
I haven't try, but I guess this also happens with the gazebo_ros_depth_camera plugin.

A:

Solved!
The problem was that the objects (cabinets, bookshelves, tables) where static in the world: 1
Changing that to 0 has solved the problem.
