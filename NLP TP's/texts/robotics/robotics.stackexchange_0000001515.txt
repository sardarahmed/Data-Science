Q:

Building a non rotating persistence of vision device

I'm looking for a way to create a non-rotating persistence of vision device. I have all the electronics set up but I'm stumped with the mechanical design.
I tried these two designs:
But these didn't work so well. Everything shakes violently and it doesn't go nearly as fast as I need (about 20 swipes per second)
Any ideas on how I can build this?

It seems to me that the two designs that you propose yourself, at least rely on rotation.
I would suggest getting rid of rotation entirely. In particular since you say you have problems swinging these arms around.
One way to go about this, is by using magnets, springs and electro magnets. Actually, instead of me explaining this, go look at a loud speaker unit, and apply that same principle to your challenge. You want it to move further though, so use some soft springs to suspend your moving  component between, so you can get some good range on it.
          <fixed electro magnet>               L
<spring>--<free moving magnet>--<electronics>--E--<spring>
          <fixed electro magnet>               D

The middle line can move from side to side, the electromagnet is curled around the sliding assembly
You would likely need to drive the electro magnet in both directions (reversing the poles) to get some good speed too.
The benefit of this, is that the suspended electronics, can be really light, so you dont need some really heavy weights to keep the vibrations down. And the two springs of either end, could carry the power to the moving electronics.
EDIT:
I got inspired by rocketnagnet's graphics, so i stole some of it, to clarify just a little bit, just to give a hint as to how my ascii graphics was intended.
