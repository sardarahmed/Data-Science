Q:

tf listener/broadcaster

Hi,
I'm looking for a way to transform coordinates from one from to another, but without setting up a broadcaster and listener. Is there a way to just call the transform function?
Or if I need the listener/broadcaster:
The tutorial I found in the ros wiki (http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF#Writing_Code) has coordinates being returned to the screen every second. I was looking for a way to do this one shot. But I am getting errors. When I set the one shot flag to true:
ros::Timer timer = n.createTimer(ros::Duration(1.0), boost::bind(&transformPoint, boost::ref(listener)),true)
(without a ros spin because I don't want the program to live forever)
it returns a warning "Timer destroyed immediately after creation.  Did you forget to store the handle?"
When I try calling the function by itself
boost::bind(&transformPoint, boost::ref(listener))
nothing happens.
And when I try to pass the listener
transformPoint(boost::ref(listener)) or transformPoint(listener)
it returns an error saying base_link doesn't exist.
Thanks for the help in advance.

A:

You can use tf::Transform directly (see tf/Overview/Data Types), it is just a btTransform from the bullet library.
For instance, if you want to transform a single point, you can use the ()-operator:
tf::Point original_point = /*...*/;
tf::Transform transform = /*...*/;
tf::Point transformed_point = transform(original_point);
