Q:

No cmake config file in gaussian process package

Hi i want to use gaussian process for obstacle prediction but i am not able to integrate gaussian_process package provided by freiburg_tools with my prediction package as this package doesn't have any cmake config file. Is there any way around it ?

A:

Gaussian_process still uses rosbuild and you tagged your question with catkin, so I guess you are using catkin.
Catkin packages can't depend on rosbuild packages.
You have two options:

Port gaussian_process to catkin (see the migration guide)
Port your package to rosbuild (less cool)
