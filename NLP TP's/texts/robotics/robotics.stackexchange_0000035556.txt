Q:

Can't import STL file into gazebo

Hello,
I can't seem to create STL files that gazebo will accept. I have tried exporting stl files from Autodesk Inventor 2012, Solidworks 2011 and Pro/Engineer wildfire 5.0. For testing purposes I have been exporting a simple rectangular prism and using the spinning top tutorial. If it is helpful I can upload the .stl files I was using. Does anybody know what I am doing wrong?
Thanks in advance
Brian
