Q:

Where can find default setup.zsh file?

I have unexpectedly changed /opt/ros/indigo/setup.zsh file and I now am unable to source the file.
I want to replace the contents of /opt/ros/indigo/setup.zsh file to the default values.
Where can I find the default file?

A:

You could run sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-indigo-catkin to get the file back.
Here is the source of the file if you'd rather manually replace it.
