Q:

How to uninstall gtsam library c++

I have installed gtsam 4 library from : https://bitbucket.org/gtborg/gtsam.git and since I am facing troubles with compilation I want to uninstall it and link to a local version. The problem is that make uninstall does not exist. Is there a way to remove it or at least make the local version be used instead of it.
In CmakeLists.txt I have include_directories and link_directories pointing to the local version but still the gtsam which is installed is the one that is used.
I found  install_manifest.txt file in build directory. As I read here it contains all the files to be installed. However. I noticed that most of the files are .h and some are .cmake I do not know if just deleting those files will fix the problem or is going to mess it up.

A:

When you install headers and libraries to a system include directory such as /usr/include and /usr/lib, the installed includes/libs will often be accessible because something else is used in that directory and it is therefore on the compilers/linkers include paths. If it is there before your local version, these files overshadow the local version. In principle, this should be managable somehow, but I couldn't solve this in the past, so I removed the installed files using the install manifest.txt:
rm `cat install_manifest.txt`

You might move them somewhere instead, just to be safe
mv -v `cat install_manifest.txt` /tmp

Though you could re-install them by make install anyway.
