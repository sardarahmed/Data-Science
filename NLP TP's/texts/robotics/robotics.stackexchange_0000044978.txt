Is there no one to run successfully RGBDSLAM?

A:

I am in the same boat with getting errors when trying to run RGBDslam with Fuerte, but I think I solved the above error message with help from the comment by dornhege: answers.ros.org/question/46669/rgbdslam-on-electric-compiling-error/. Make sure that you have g2o downloaded correctly by running roscd g2o. If you get an error and are not transported to a new directory, try downloading with svn straight into a recognized ROS path. Then remember to edit your CMakeLists file after editing the manifest as mentioned in the previous comment by removing find_package(g2o REQUIRED).
