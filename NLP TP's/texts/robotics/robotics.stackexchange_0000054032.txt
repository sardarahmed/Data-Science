Q:

How do I use PCL from ROS Hydro?

I am trying to understand how PCL is integrated into ROS Hydro. I installed ROS in Ubuntu 12.04 using the ros-hydro-desktop-full package. From "rospack list" I can see that it comes with 4 PCL packages:

pcl
pcl_conversions
pcl_msgs
pcl_ros

What is the functionality of these 4 packages, especially pcl_ros and pcl? There is also a pcl-1.7 folder in my /opt/ros/hydro/share folder with some cmake config files. There is no package.xml file though. What does this folder do?
Also, I seem to have 2 copies of the pcl-1.7 libraries. I have it in /usr/lib and also in /opt/ros/hydro/lib. So it seems like I have a standalone pcl library (I am not sure how I got this) and one that is integrated with ROS. Is this going to be a problem?
Finally, and this is the biggest source of my confusion, the wiki page for hydro/migration says:

pcl is no longer packaged by the ROS community as a catkin package, so any packages which directly depend on pcl should instead use the new rosdep rules libpcl-all and libpcl-all-dev and follow the PCL developer's guidelines for using PCL in your CMake.

So, why is there a pcl package in ROS Hydro in the first place with libraries in /opt/ros/hydro/lib?
As you can see I am quite confused, any help will be greatly appreciated!

If possible, please enumerate the exact steps needed for this. I was following the tutorial : http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Tutorials, but was not able to run it. While creating package I needed to remove pcl dependency, then also I was not able to compile code using voxel_grid.

Can specify exactly what error you are getting? And are you using ROS Hydro?

I'm confirming that the tutorials should be updated.
