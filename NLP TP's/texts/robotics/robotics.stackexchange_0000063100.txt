Q:

View rqt console in other machine

Hi, I run a example topic in machine and I would like see debug messages (ROS_INFO, ROS_ERROR...) in another machine.  I used export ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP in first machine and export ROS_MASTER_URI in sencod. I see in second machine the topics publication values but not show message when I run rqt_console. In the first machine, rqt_console show  this messages perfectly. Where is the problem?
Thanks in advanced

Hi there,
I realise this is an old question, but I just came across the same issue and couldn't find a simple answer anywhere quickly.
What you did is correct, set the ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP on the two machines to the ip of the ros core host.
Launch rqt_console on the second machine, and click the settings icon. Change the Rosout topic to /rosout instead of /rosout_agg, and then you should see all of your messages appear.
