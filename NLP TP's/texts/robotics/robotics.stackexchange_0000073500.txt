Q:

Where can I find information on the published topics?

Where can I find any documentation on the topics that are published when openni_launch is running?

A:

There might be documentation on the http://wiki.ros.org page of the corresponding ROS package (I'm guessing that's http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch).
But even if there isn't, you can always do rostopic list and then rostopic info [topic name], as well as rosnode list and rosnode info [openni-related node name]
