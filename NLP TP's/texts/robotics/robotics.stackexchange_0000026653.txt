Q:

floating point exception in gzserver

I am trying to get started with gazebo and I just about finished following the instructions here:
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.9/install
I installed using the pre-compiled binaries on Ubuntu 13.04.
I am having trouble starting gzserver however. It crashes with a floating point exception error. Does anyone have an insights? This is the output:
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version

Could you run it with gdb as well to get more info? It guess it would help figuring out the problem.

So I'm running it on an Ubuntu 12.04 now, with no problems. I don't have the 13.04 anymore, so I'm can't debug.

I can confirm the bug, I'm running Arch Linux. I have uploaded the gdb in pastebin: http://pastebin.com/YcBPcxK7

A:

This has been fixed in more recent versions of Gazebo.
