Q:

How can I publish hexadecimal values?

Hello,
I haven't been able to find this on the ROS wiki:
If I would like to create a publisher for hexadecimal, what type of message would I use? Specifically, I would like to publish this list to the \commands topic:
0x00
0x01
0x1F
0x7F
. I would then write a subscriber to \commands that took the hex values and sent them one by one to a serial port, where my motor controller understood them as motor commands and acted accordingly. I don't think they would publish under int32, would they?
Thanks,
Khiya

A:

You could create a custom message that contains:
uint8[] commands
where 'commands' would contain your sequence of bytes.

Again, thanks you all. It hadn't quite clicked that hex is always just a sort of shorthand for binary. I appreciate your patience!

@Khiya, any number can be hex. It's just a matter of interpreting/printing it that way. It's actually sent across as binary of course. rostopic echo interprets it as a decimal number if it's an int, but you could just as easily print it as hex with printf( "%x", value );

Thanks a lot then!

I don't think you can get much simpler than this.

Thanks. So there's no simple way of publishing hex numbers on a ROS topic?
