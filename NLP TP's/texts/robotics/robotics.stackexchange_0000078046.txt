Q:

How to install lsd_slam on my ROS?

I am currently trying to create an autonomous drone. For this task, I want to employ  the monocular SLAM method. After reading a few papers and having trawled forums on the internet, I have decided to use LSD_SLAM. Now I have built my ROS Kinetic from source on my Raspberry Pi with Raspbian Lite. To install a new package I will have to first invoke the command:
rosinstall_generator ros_comm <your_extra_packages> --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall

For this I replaced the <your_extra_packages> with just lsd_slam. However, it returns saying:
The following not released packages/stacks will be ignored: lsd_slam

How am I supposed to install lsd_slam onto my ROS now?

A:

This means lsd_slam has not been officially released, which means you'll have to build it from source.
They have installation instructions on their github repository; have you tried following them?
They're still using an outdated build system (rosbuild), so you'll have to learn about how to set up a rosbuild workspace. This rosbuild with catkin tutorial is pretty good, and despite saying it applies to ROS Groovy, it actually applies to Groovy and all newer versions of ROS.

I don't want to use rosbuild as of now, and therefore will defer to a different package that is released for catkin.

Will lsd_slam be available on Ubuntu MATE? I hope I wouldn't have to build from source on Ubuntu MATE too?

Unreleased means unreleased. There are no binaries of any kind. You should still be able to install the dependencies through apt (binaries) and then build only lsd_slam in your workspace.
