Q:

rosdep doesn't "see" Python 3 package

i'm installing cartography,when i executing the command
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y

in https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compilation.html,it always turn to executing command
sudo -H apt-get install -y python-sphinx

however,i'm using python3 and the rosdep version in my ubuntu20.04LTS is python3-rosdep,why it will turn to install python-sphinx?i think the right sphinx version for this is python3-sphinx and i apt-get install it and it does be installed ,then it still reports the same error.therefore i am stuck in the above commands.
here are the errors:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Package python-sphinx is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
  sphinx-doc sphinx-common

E: Package 'python-sphinx' has no installation candidate
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y python-sphinx] failed

A:

rosdep will attempt to install whatever dependency is declared in the package.xml files for the packages that you are asking it to resolve.
In this case I believe that you're using a package that declares an explicit dependency on the rosdep key python-sphinx
You are either using the wrong branch for that package or it has not yet been updated to support a python3 version of the rosdep, python3-sphinx
If the package has not been updated yet a pull request to help the packages at issue migrate to be Python 3 compatible would I'm sure be appreciated. There's a guide here: http://wiki.ros.org/UsingPython3

thanks for answering，i just install python3-sphinx by apt and ignore “rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y”，then i solve dependencies once i encountered while compling cartographer.
