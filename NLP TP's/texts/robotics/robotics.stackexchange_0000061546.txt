Q:

Using Senz3d with depthimage_to_laserscan

Hi everyone,
I'm using Senz3d to get depthimage data, and I would like to use this depthimage data with package depthimage_to_laserscan. But when I run this data with depthimage_to_laserscan package, it showed the warning message below:
[ WARN] [1407311794.272714061]: [image_transport] Topics '/softkinetic_camera/depth_registered/image' and '/softkinetic_camera/depth_registered/camera_info' do not appear to be synchronized. In the last 10s:
Image messages received: 33
CameraInfo messages received: 0
Synchronized pairs: 0
I think I have to publish '/softkinetic_camera/depth_registered/camera_info', but I don't have any experienced with this. So, anyone can help me?
Thanks,
Duong

A:

It looks like your camera driver isn't publishing CameraInfo messages for the depth image properly.
The driver probably needs to be updated to support maintaining and publishing CameraInfo. The camera_info_manager library makes this easier.

Hi ahendrix,
Thank for your answer. Do you have any guides or tutorials to work with camera_info_manager and CameraInfo ?

Not really. The only tutorial available in the camera_info_manager package just links to the source code the camera1394 driver: http://wiki.ros.org/camera_info_manager/Tutorials/UsingCameraInfoManagerInCameraDriver%28C%2B%2B%29

Thank ahendrix, I'm trying to use camera_info_manager. I will post the solution when success.

Hi @ahendrix, do you have experienced with following error:
Could not convert depth image to laserscan: scan_height ( 1 pixels) is too large for the image height.?
