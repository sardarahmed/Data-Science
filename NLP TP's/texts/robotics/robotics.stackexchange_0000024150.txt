Q:

How to make the output axis of hingejoint with rotational motor not affected by physics?

I want the rotational motors be affected only by my controller, not by the physics of the world. The problem is shown in this video. How to fix this?

A:

The problem comes from the fact that the environment is applying some forces and torques on your motor and the motor cannot hold its position because it is not strong enough. To fix this problem, you should simply increase the strength of the motor. For a RotationalMotor, increasing the maxTorque value should resolve the problem.
You should also ensure that you didn't override this value with a lower value using wb_motor_set_available_torque or wb_motor_set_torque. That means that you should not perform torque/force control, but either position control or velocity control (so that you don't limit the motor torque).
For a LinearMotor, the same applies with the force settings of the motor instead of torque. But I believe that in your case, you only have rotational motors.
