Q:

car-like robot navigation in gazebo

Hallo.
I've got urdf car-like robot model, which i can teleoperate in gazebo. Also i've added hokuyo laser scan to it.
The question is: what are next steps to realize navigation on my robot?
What are the basic principles of implementing navigation?
Is there any useful links or tutorials?
Can i somehow modify move_base for my robot?
Thanks.

Hello, Peter. I want to use car-like robot in gazebo and want to control it from keyboard. Previously I was working with differential drive robots in gazebo. Can you please guide me that how I can start working with car like robots in gazebo. Is there any tutorial? Thanks

Actually I have not seen any tutorials specially for car-like robots. So I did it step by step. First created my urdf-model. Then added joint controllers and implemented simple teleop-control node. Now i'm trying to make wheel-odometry for it.

selam peter ,i was search a bit, it seems their is no tutorial to implement teleop-control for carlike robot even now , can you  please explain how you create teleop node and implement it in gazebo ?

A:

There is presently no complete solution, but you may find some of the links from the Ackermann steering group useful.

@joq what are you mean by " There is presently no complete solution " , are there no people who already done the navigation in gazebo? or even can't make wheel-odometry & differential drive robot in it ?
PS:  i really want to know it , it's very important to me .

That comment was accurate back in Sept. 2012. The situation has change since then. I no longer work on driverless cars, but others have made what appears to be significant progress. Please check the http://wiki.ros.org/Ackermann%20Group links.

@forinkzan I am trying to control a car-like robot in gazebo as well. Could you please explain how you realized the teleoperation? And did you manage to navigate it?
