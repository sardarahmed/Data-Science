Q:

Geo-Reference PointCloud2

Hi There!
Could someone please provide me some reading/method for the best practice of producing a geo-referenced point cloud.
I have an SBG systems AHRS (RTK GPS and IMU fused at 200hz) and a LiDAR. Both of which have ROS drivers already.
How can I produce the point cloud in the world frame rather than the robot?
What is the minimum requirement for publishers/subscribers/nodes since the SBG publishes:
    ros::Publisher imu_raw_pub;

    ros::Publisher imu_head_pub; //todo magnitometer data

    ros::Publisher gps_pos_pub;

    ros::Publisher gps_vel_pub;

    ros::Publisher gps_head_pub;

    ros::Publisher ekf_pose_pub;

    ros::Publisher ekf_quat_pub;

    ros::Publisher time_pub;

Appreciate any help.

The recommended way to geo reference data is using the common transforms outlined in REP 105
