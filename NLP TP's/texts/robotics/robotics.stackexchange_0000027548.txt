Q:

RGBD camera noise model

I saw there are many sensor models and plugins in order to simulate an RGB camera (either Asus, Kinect, etc). However, I do not see any way to include noise in both RGB and Depth, neither in Gazebo nor in the available plugins. I tried the  tag in the sensor but it seems to have no effect.
Is there any gazebo_ros plugin (or Gazebo plugin) somewhere to simulate the RGB camera more accurately?
Thank you!
For completeness, I include the part of the sensor of my model:
    <sensor type="depth" name="rgbd_camera">
        <camera>
            <horizontal_fov>1.047</horizontal_fov>
            <image>
                <width>640</width>
                <height>480</height>
                <format>R8G8B8</format>
            </image>
            <clip>
                <near>0.05</near>
                <far>30</far>
            </clip>
            <noise>   <!-- This does apparently nothing neither RGB nor depth-->
                <type>gaussian</type>
                <mean>0.0</mean>
                <stddev>5.0</stddev>
            </noise>
        </camera>
        <update_rate>30.0</update_rate>
        <always_on>1</always_on>
        <plugin name="multirotor_rgbd_plugin" filename="libgazebo_ros_openni_kinect.so">
            <imageTopicName>rgb/image_raw</imageTopicName>
            <cameraInfoTopicName>rgb/camera_info</cameraInfoTopicName>
            <pointCloudTopicName>depth/points</pointCloudTopicName>
            <depthImageTopicName>depth/image_raw</depthImageTopicName>
            <depthImageCameraInfoTopicName>depth/camera_info</depthImageCameraInfoTopicName>
            <pointCloudCutoff>0.4</pointCloudCutoff>
            <pointCloudCutoffMax>5.0</pointCloudCutoffMax>
            <frameName>rgbd_camera_link</frameName>
            <cameraName>rgbd_camera</cameraName>
            <updateRate>30.0</updateRate>
        </plugin>
    </sensor>

Any ideas anyone?

A:

You will need to implement your own plugin to add depth noise.

Hi @nkoenig
Is it the recommended way to achieve this? I think someone can simply add noise to camera sensor using noise model.
http://bit.ly/2j886ck
But this feature is aparently not available in DepthCamera sensor.
http://bit.ly/2k4DKH7
Any specific reasons to omit that or can we expect this feature in a future release?
Note: This requirement is also reported in https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/2125/depth-sensor-noise-model

Hi, did you manage to add noise to the depth point cloud? If so, did you write your own plugin or did you find another (easier) way? I'm stuck at the same problem.
