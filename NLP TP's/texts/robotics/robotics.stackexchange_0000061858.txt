Q:

Code Blocks and catkin Indigo?

Hi,
I'm trying to follow the codeblocks instruction in wiki.ros.org/IDEs but when I try

rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags PackageName
rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=lflags PackageName

with the beginner_tutorials package, or something fancier like rviz, I just get a blank line as a result.
How can I use codeblocks to build a catkin package?
Using Indigo Igloo, ubuntu 14.04 and CodeBlocks 13.12.
