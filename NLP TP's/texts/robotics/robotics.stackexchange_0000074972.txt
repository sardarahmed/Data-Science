Q:

Laser Scanner Data Fluctuation

Hello,
I am using 2 laser scanners, that are produced on two topics scan1 and scan2 respectively. After remapping both topics to one topic scan, the data are fluctuating, it goes in a cycle sometimes it reads from scan1 and sometimes from scan2 although the topic is scan now. Any help please?

A:

I think it fluctuates because whenever a new scan message arrives it will be shown up and the old one will be discarded. And your data will be arriving alternately from each laser. You could use the laser assebmler to combine both scans.
