Q:

ImportError for any rosdep command

Any rosdep command I try to run gives me the same error:
[robosalmon ~/catkin_ws_source_pkgs (localhost)]$ rosdep -h
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/rosdep", line 3, in <module>
    from rosdep2.main import rosdep_main

ImportError: cannot import name OS_LINARO

I've tried sudo apt-get install python-rosdep and it was apparently successful, but didn't fix rosdep.
How can I fix rosdep?

A:

Figured this out. The solution was to pip install it.
$ sudo pip install rosdep

This shouldn't be necessary. Which platform are you on?

result of $ uname -a: Linux robosalmon 3.8.0-44-generic #66~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 04:01:04 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I had the same problem when running "sudo rosdep init" and this solution appeared to fix it. On my system: $uname -a: Linux my-name 3.13.0-63-generic #103-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 14 21:42:59 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux.
I recently upgraded the computer from Precise to Trusty.

I suspect you have an out-of-date version of rospkg. Try upgrading rospkg with sudo apt-get install python-rospkg instead of installing rosdep through pip.
