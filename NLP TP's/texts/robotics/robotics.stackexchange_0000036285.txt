This is being published when minimal is launched.

What is throwing this error? What is publishing odometry and imu?

A:

This means that the messages coming from the imu and the odometry have timestamps that are very different. This can be caused by messages getting delayed because of high system load, or by clocks of different hosts that are not synchronized. In any case, you cannot expect your system to run properly with such high difference in timestamps.
