Q:

Check ROS Version in CMake File with Catkin

Is there a way to check the version of ROS being used in the CMakeLists.txt file? i.e., are there any variables or macros to query the version?

A:

The question is what you mean with "ROS version".
Each package has its own version number and they level independently. After calling find_package() to find a catkin package foo you can access the version variables for it (as it is recommended CMake standard):

${foo_VERSION}
* ${roscpp_VERSION_MAJOR}
${roscpp_VERSION_MINOR}
* ${roscpp_VERSION_PATCH}
