Q:

Multiple Kinects: Same Topics from different nodes, how to subscribe?

Hi All,
If anyone has any links or references about connecting 2 or more Kinects to the same computer and specifically obtaining & integrating data from them, could you please reply here?
So I am able to launch separate files for each kinect and am able to launch data separately. Here's the output of my rxgraph

The problem is my process listens to a topic and it cannot distinguish between same topics from different nodes, how can I make them publish topics with unique names? or how can I listen to topics from a specific node?
Best,
CV

Could you specify what you mean by multiple kinects?  Do you want data on connecting multple kinects on one computer or are you talking data fusion?

A:

The new drivers used by openni_kinect support multiple cameras on one computer.
For fusing data I suggest looking PCL
