Q:

Command line parameter to change gmapping resolution

I have another question with gmapping, is there a parameter that can be set at runtime that will change the resolution of the map generated?
Also is there a paramter to set the size of the map generated?
I am kind of looking for something like this:
rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan resolution=1 width=200 height=200
But this doesn't work. I don't want the occupancy grid to be 4k X 4k.
Thanks,
BM

A:

You can set the gmapping ROS parameters on the command line using the _PARAM_NAME:=foo See documentation of ROS commandline arguments for Private Parameters on the wiki.
