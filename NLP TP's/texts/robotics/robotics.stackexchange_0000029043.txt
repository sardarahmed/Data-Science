Q:

Confused with gazebo plugin path

So, when I use the plugin libgazebo_ros_multicamera.so, I was able to successfully get the images I want. However, I am trying to locate the path for libgazebo_ros_multicamera.so, so I looked to setup.sh and found that the GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH is:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-9/plugins
But when I go into this path, I can't find libgazebo_ros_multicamera.so. Are there any other place that libgazebo_ros_multicamera.so is located?

A:

Hi,
Some of the paths could be defined in LD_LIBRARY_PATH too. If you have installed ROS from Debian packages these plugins are in /opt/ros/<rosdistro>/ or in your install directory if you installed ROS from sources. A command to find the library could be:
du -a /opt/ros/<rosdistro> | grep libgazebo_ros_multicamera.so

or
du -a <path to your workspace> | grep libgazebo_ros_multicamera.so
