Q:

catkin_pkg.package missing

Hi, I'm new to Ubuntu/Linux and I am trying to install ROS. I am following the instructions but run into a cmake error when I run catkin_make. Here's the output from that command. It seems that there are similar problems but I don't see the exact same error message in other posts. Any help would be appreciated and thanks in advance.

Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

@JoSo please us the block quote functionality for readability, (highlight the text and press the 1010 button, or put 4 spaces in front of each line) I've done this for you.

I reverted back to the original Python that came with Ubuntu 13.04 and everything worked. I was able to go through the beginner's tutorials with success. Thanks. As a side note, my issues with opening the Rviz plugin with MOVEIT! also cleared.
Heard on the block quote.

Great. Please accept the answer using the checkbox so others know your problem is solved.

A:

Your problem is that you're missing the python module catkin_pkg. It looks like you're not using the system version of python. It looks like you have debian packages installed so you need to make sure that catkin_pkg is on your PYTHONPATH of your alternative python instance.
