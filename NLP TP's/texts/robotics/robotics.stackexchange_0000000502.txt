Q:

Is there a place for posting "look at what I did" videos?

Robots are somewhat videogenic, and the old saying "show me, don't tell me" is especially applicable.
But of course, a video is not a question, so it doesn't fit the Stack Exchange format.  Maybe video links would be more suitable in a CodeProject post.  It just seems like this board hits the right cross-section of people, whose projects I would be interested in seeing.

A:

Let's Make Robots is a good place to show off ones projects. See the robots section to see other peoples work as well.
