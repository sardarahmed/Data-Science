Q:

why the catkin_init_workspace command is not included as a step in the InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment tutorial?

More than a question is just a suggestion to update this tutorial.  Thanks.

A:

Note that the wiki is community maintained, if you think that things should be updated feel free to contribute.
Also note that for quite some time, catkin_make automatically initializes the workspace if it hasn't been initialized. So there is no need to explicitly call catkin_init_workspace anymore (not exactly sure when this change happened). I still find myself calling catkin_init_workspace manually mostly out of habit, and it certainly doesn't cause any problems. I think you are referring to this tutorial, which works perfectly on my machine.
See this question for more, or check the catkin_make source code that actually initializes the workspace if required.

Thanks for your reply jarvisschultz.  For some reason I had to type catkin_init_workspace, otherwise catkin_make thrown out an error, and no CMakelist.txt file was created in the src folder.  I've installed ros indigo, so maybe this could be the reason?  Also I'm using a python virtual environment..

ROS Indigo likely isn't the issue, but perhaps your virtual environment is. Without knowing what error was thrown by catkin_make, it's tough to say.
