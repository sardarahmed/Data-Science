Q:

'type' object is not subscriptable

I have a node that is a service that lists wifi access points and their details. When I first run rosrun there's no errors. Then I make a service request and it says Error processing request: 'type' object is not subscriptable. I'm sure it's a basic Python error but I can't figure out what it is. Thanks!
The relevant code:
    ssid_list.append(ssid)
    strength_list.append(strength)
    secured_list.append(secured)

  return WifiListResponse[String(ssid_list), UInt8(strength_list), Bool(secured_list)]

my .srv file:
int8 request
---
string[] ssid_list
uint8[] strength_list
bool[] secured_list

Unfortunately, I think the code you pasted is not enough to infer what's going wrong. Please paste the complete relevant code not just snippets that don't contain any context. Also, please copy-paste the complete backtrace.

A:

Your code is not valid Python.
Try something like
WifiListResponse(ssid_list, strength_list, secured_list)
