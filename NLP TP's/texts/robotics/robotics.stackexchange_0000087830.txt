Q:

Delay in JointStates

Hi
I am working on ROS Kinetic with Ubuntu 16.04. I am simulating my robot with gazebo and ros-control however the terminal always shows this warning ::
process[coro/joint_controller_spawner-1]: started with pid [21948]

process[robot_state_publisher-2]: started with pid [21949] Loaded

joint_state_controller Started ['joint_state_controller'] successfully

[coro/joint_controller_spawner-1] process has finished cleanly log file: /home/bhoot/.ros/log/54979f64-835c-11e8-8840-a08cfdeabd87/coro-joint_controller_spawner-1*.log

1531129330.670413 seconds old.

[ WARN] [1531129358.795952825]: Received JointState is 1531129333.605810 seconds old.

[ WARN] [1531129388.815334092]: Received JointState is 1531129342.521295 seconds old.

My yaml files and launch files are attached :
C:\fakepath\Selection_034.png
C:\fakepath\Selection_035.png
C:\fakepath\Selection_036.png
C:\fakepath\Selection_037.png
I tried changing the rate of jpint values publisher, but no use. Any idea what I am  missing ??

Please don't use images for text. Images are not searchable and people cannot copy and paste them. Please update your question with a copy and paste of the your files instead of using images.

I am having the same issue, did you solve it.
Comment by Pulkit123 on 2018-12-06:
Yeah I solved it, using use_sim_time=true in gazebo_world.launch file

A:

Try setting use_sim_time=true, as it seems to be getting very old joint states
