Q:

How to Correct wrong Environment setup?

I was trying to set up my environment variables and typed in the following code:
echo "source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Later i realised i only had groovy, so i changed electric in above to groovy but whenever i try to run ros or baxter, always this message gets displayed that
bash: /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash: No such file or directory

My question is how to get the wrong environment set-up command disabled so that the irritating message is not displayed again and again? Thanks in advance.

A:

Just remove all lines with electric from your ~/.bashrc with a text editor.
The second message seems to indicate that not roscore is running.
