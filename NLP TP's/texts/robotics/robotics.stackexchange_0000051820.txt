Q:

Compiling single package under winros

Hello guys,
I have successfully installed winros on my Win7 system and need to create my own Messagetype. This worked very well by createing a CMakeLists.txt in the directory and adding these two lines.
add_message_files(DIRECTORY msg FILES message.msg)
generate_messages()

I tried to compile the package with cmake but that didn't work. I got stucked with an error about the message_generationConfig.cmake which I found under C:\opt\ros\groovy\x86\share\message_generation\cmake. The commandline output advised me to add that path to an environment variable like message_generation_DIR but that haven't worked.
Well, I finally compiled all packages and my own with the messagetypes again with  "winros_make" and then the Headerfile was generated.
Has anybody figured out how to compile one single package with cmake or has somebody used the rosmake component under winros?
Best regards

A:

The winros_make command just makes a call out to cmake, but potentially passes alot of variables. You can see part of winros_make's scripting which makes the call here.
You should also see the output for the cmake command that winros_make executed directly on standard output (check the print lines in the script above). At any rate, that should give you an idea of what magic winros_make is doing under the hood.
Note that rosmake is legacy - it is the tool that was used for the old build system. winros_make is effectively the windows counterpart of catkin_make on linux. It just adds a few extra windows specific features to make it easier for the user.
We plan to perhaps have a script to simplify building of packages only. I did that with fuerte - just haven't gotten that far with groovy yet.
