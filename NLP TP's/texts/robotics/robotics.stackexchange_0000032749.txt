Q:

rosmake compiler warnings

I was trying to rosmake turtlebot_apps on beagleboard and got compiler warnings like
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< kdl [PASS] [ 9.12 seconds ] -- WARNING: 2 compiler warnings

Should I really care about those warnings? Are they similar as normal compiler warnings?

A:

They are exactly the same as normal compiler warnings.
rosmake records warnings from a compile and gives you the condensed output you see.
Usually you also get an output that tells you where the logfile is that contains the compile output with the warnings to look at.
As for caring: Ideally code compiles without warnings. Otherwise it depends on the warnings itself. For ROS packages I would assume/hope that the warnings should not lead to bugs.
