Q:

ethzasl_icp_mapping error

Hi,
I am using the package "ethzasl_icp_mapping" to build a 3D map using a stereo camera. When i feed the mapper node with a pointcloud, i have the following error :
ERROR Cannot lookup TOdomToScanner(odom to /stereo_camera)
How can i resolve this ?
With : rosrun tf tf_monitor, i have :
RESULTS: for all Frames
Frames:
Frame: /odom published by /mapper Average Delay: 0.00053216 Max Delay: 0.0137875
All Broadcasters:
Node: /mapper 878.531 Hz, Average Delay: 0.00053216 Max Delay: 0.0137875
RESULTS: for all Frames
Frames:
Frame: /odom published by /mapper Average Delay: 0.000526054 Max Delay: 0.0137875
All Broadcasters:
Node: /mapper 873.915 Hz, Average Delay: 0.000526054 Max Delay: 0.0137875
..........
It appears that i have no /stereo_camera frame that is being published. How can i create it ?
Thank you

Hi Sentinal_Bias, the error that i am  getting is now in the post, can you help me with it please ?

A:

Hi
Run tf view_frames
it should show you a graph of all the frames if something is not connected it means a tf transform is missing. When i was using that package i was using a kinect so i just used the launch file, but if you are using a stereo camera i think you need to define a tf transform that gets you from your sensor to the body...

Hi, thank you Sentinal_Bias for responding, I have a Kinect too and i tryed to use the package by running the launch files. In launch/openni, i launched : "sensor.launch", "tracker.launch" and "tracker_viewer-groovy.launch". The topic "/point_map" is not being published.

you should only have to luanch tracker_viewer-groovy.launch and it will Launch the other launch files. Also i presume your ROS distribution is groovy. I use Fuerte btw
