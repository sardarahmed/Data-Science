Q:

rosserial_python arduino node queue_size problem

When launching rosserial_python I receive the following warning:

/rosdistro: indigo
/rosversion: 1.11.10
/serial_node/baud: 57600
/serial_node/port: /dev/ttyACM0

self.publisher = rospy.Publisher(self.topic, self.message)
How can I fix it ?
I've tried to change my arduino code:
ros::Publisher pub("/MockBot/adc", &adc_msg, queue_size=1);
But I now the compiler throw me errors...
Where is the trick to make it work ?
Thanks in advance
Christian

A:

This is a warning in the rosserial_python node; not in your arduino program.
This particular warning is just a warning; you can ignore it and your code will continue to work reasonably well. You can learn more about the details by reading the link mentioned in the warning.
You should check the rosserial_python bug tracker to see if this has been reported or fixed, and if it hasn't you should report it as a bug.
