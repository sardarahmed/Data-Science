Q:

How can I get the Image.data of sensor_msgs/Image in Python

Hi ,
I am learning turtlebot_simulator with gazebo.
I am trying to write a listener in python to subscriber the topic of 'camera/rgb/image_raw'. But I have problems in getting the Image.data for it is uint8[], I want to know how can I translate it into a normal matrix or image which can be dealt with.
Thank you!
