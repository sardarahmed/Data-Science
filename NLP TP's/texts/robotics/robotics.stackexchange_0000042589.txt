Q:

Problem with sbpl package

Hi!
I'm working with Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS Electric to deal with the Robotnik Summit robot. When installing the navigation_experimental stack (https://kforge.ros.org/navigation/experimental), I have some problems when building these two packages:
sbpl_lattice_planner
sbpl_recovery
When doing the "rosmake" for those two packages, I get the same error, this one:
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:266 (message):
A required package was not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:320 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
CMakeLists.txt:15 (pkg_check_modules)
When doing the "rosdep install", it says that the package "sbpl" cannot be found. But the strange thing is that I have that package installed. In fact, if I do:
rospack find sbpl
It finds the package, with this path:
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/sbpl
The path of navigation_experimental is:
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/navigation_experimental
The "rospack find" finds the sbpl package, but when installing other packages it can't find it.
Any ideas?
Thank you very much!

A:

I'm willing to bet you're using the fuerte version of navigation_experimental with the electric version of SBPL. The fuerte version uses the new build system which treats SBPL as a system dependency instead of a ROS package. Assuming you checked navigation_experimental out from source control, you should be able to checkout the tagged 'electric' version which looks for the 'ROS package' version of SBPL.
