Q:

which version of Opencv should I use?

Hi everyone,
I'm a beginner in ROS. Currently, I'm trying to use a camera to locate and identify the color balls by the OpenCV package, but depend on my research I found that there has two version of OpenCV, one is OpenCV 2 and OpenCV 3.
So what is different between this two OpenCV? And which one will be more suitable for me?
By the way, I'm using ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit indigo.
Thank you so much.

A:

Hello, both of them are great, if you have not learned openCV, just to learn opencv3 since it have some different definitions of static parameters and this version has a better frame than opencv2.
However, when you want to use openCV3 , you need to be really careful since some algorithms like SURF are not built directly in a traditional way, which means maybe you need to spend several hours to build the developing environment with the help of documents.Besides, lots of existing codes are wrote with opencv2,so be careful if you want to make an old package ,there will be many problems. :)
If you want to know more about the difference between opencv2 and opencv3, I think you should go to opencv's website

Thank you so much. I think I will choose use opencv2 since there will be many problems if I'm doing something wrong.
