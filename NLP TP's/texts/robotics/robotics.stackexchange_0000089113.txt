Q:

[ROS2 LAUNCH] How to correctly create a Lifecycle launch file

Hi,
I'm trying to write a Python launch file that handles the state transitions of my lifecycle node. In particular I would like to launch a "Robot State Publisher" node when my node reaches the inactive state after that it as been configured.
I followed as example the launch file on Github as indicated here:
https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/master/launch_ros/examples/lifecycle_pub_sub_launch.py
but I get the following error when I launch it:

[ERROR] [launch.LaunchService]: Caught
exception in launch (see debug for
traceback): launch file at
'/home/walter/devel/ros2_ws/install/stereolabs_zed/share/stereolabs_zed/launch/zed.py'
does not contain the required function
'generate_launch_description()'

Is the example updated to the new launch style available in Bouncy?
This is my launch:
"""Launch a lifecycle ZED node and the Robot State Publisher"""

ROS2 Bouncy from source

Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): -> Add -d to ros2 launch before package and launch file name to get the traceback:
ros2 launch -d foo bar_launch.py

A:

If you want to start the launch file with the ros2 launch command, you should define a generate_launch_description function that returns the LaunchDescriptioninstead of a main.
E.g
def generate_launch_description():

    # ...

    # Launch Description
    ld = launch.LaunchDescription()

    # ...
  
    # Add the actions to the launch description.
    # The order they are added reflects the order in which they will be executed.
    ld.add_action(register_event_handler_for_zed_reaches_inactive_state)
    ld.add_action(register_event_handler_for_zed_reaches_active_state)
    ld.add_action(zed_node)
    ld.add_action(emit_event_to_request_that_zed_does_configure_transition)

    return ld

Thank you. I missed the information about how to migrate from legacy launch to the new system available in Bouncy. Very useful
