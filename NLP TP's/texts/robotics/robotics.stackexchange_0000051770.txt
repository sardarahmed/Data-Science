Q:

the right way to install openi-kinect

I just brought a kinect and wanted to the rgdbslam
I download the SensorKinect-Bin-Linux64-v5.0.1.32.tar.bz2 and installed it.
after that I issued "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch" and I got the following
error messages
enter c[camera/depth/metric_rect-9] process has died [pid 24153, exit code 255, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/nodelet_core/nodelet/bin/nodelet load depth_image_proc/convert_metric /camera_nodelet_manager --no-bond image_raw:=image_rect_raw image:=image_rect __name:=metric_rect __log:=/home/benzene/.ros/log/7b10089a-cf1e-11e2-a66b-001e33286433/camera-depth-metric_rect-9.log].

does anyone knows what's going on ?
please teach me how to install the kinect driver in the right way.
thanks!

did you try using apt-get? the packages are ros-groovy-openni-camera and ros-groovy-openni-launch, or fuerte respectively
Comment by Benzwr on 2013-06-07:
yes, I did !

A:

In order to install the kinect, under Unbuntu 12.04 or 12.10, with ROS-GROOVY follow this procedure :

install Ubuntu (12.10 or 12.04)
install ros groovy as following : http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu
install ros-groovy-openni-* by doing in console "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-openni-*"
download olf version of NITE 1.5.2.21 at http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/openni-sdk-history-2/
extract zip file in a folder
extract bz2 file in a folder
in terminal, go in NITE folder (with command "cd foldername")
launch UNINSTALL script first, by doing in terminal "sudo ./uninstall.sh"
launch install script by doing in terminal "sudo ./install.sh"

Have a good day !
Bests,
St√©phane

Please specify your setup in your question : distribution, ROS version etc... :-)

Thanks for the reply. But I'm using fuerte

Agree with lindzey - NITE steps not required (for me).
