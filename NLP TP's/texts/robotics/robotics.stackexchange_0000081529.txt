Q:

Use ROSJava on Kinetic

Is anyone having any idea how to install rosjava api on kinetic. I followed the documentation http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/kinetic/Source%20Installation    but I am getting stuck in the step "catkin_make". Its showing some error :
CMake Error at rosjava_build_tools/CMakeLists.txt:49 (file):
file failed to open for writing (Permission denied):
/opt/ros/kinetic/share/maven/rospack_nosubdirs

Any help would be appreciated.

A:

@shantanu543 are you installing from debians or from source? Try going for the source installation, it's not that hard to do and perhaps it will save you some trouble. Remember to source the workspace that you used to build rosjava whenever you want to create or build your own projects.
