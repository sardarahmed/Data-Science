Q:

How do i get ros_lib and roscpp source files?

Hi,
i want to implement roscpp to my C++ project to communicate to ROS via TCP. (microcontroller programmed in C++)
Here is a little background:
Some time ago i used rosserial_client on my C++ project. To get rosserial_client source files (.h and .cpp) to my project what i did before was doing this in terminal on ROS indigo :
rosrun rosserial_client make_libraries

And it got me a nice folder named "ros_lib" containing everything i needed to port rosserial_client to my project. Worked out fine. (.h and .cpp files)
But now i want to use roscpp in my project, to use tcp communication with tcp sockets (i think i need to use transport.h). And i cannot figure out how to get roscpp and roscpp dependencies source files (.h and .cpp) to a single folder with everything working.
I tried to get roscpp from Github then doing a catkin_make on it, but could'nt find something useable after all.
How do i get ros_lib and roscpp source files (in a single folder, with everything working) to port to my C++ project?
Thank you!

A:

Here are the complete source build instructions:

http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Source

EDIT: To find the roscpp dependencies in your workspace, first source it, then run:
$ rosdep keys roscpp

For Kinetic, that shows:
rosgraph_msgs
rosconsole
roslang
catkin
xmlrpcpp
std_msgs
message_runtime
rostime
roscpp_serialization
roscpp_traits
message_generation
cpp_common
pkg-config

Thank you! Now, do you know which files i need to make tcp connection to my ROS Master? Is there a tutorial on how to use roscpp to connect to master via TCP?

I doubt there is such a tutorial. You should look at the code.
