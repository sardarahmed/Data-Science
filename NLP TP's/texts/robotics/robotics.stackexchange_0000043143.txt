Q:

hector_mapping set-up

From the tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/hector_slam/Tutorials/SettingUpForYourRobot) which launch file is to be edited?
hector_slam/hector_mapping/launch/mapping_default.launch
or other?
Also, from the tutorial the parameters are listed as value="base_frame", value="odom", etc.; but in the launch file (mapping_default.launch) the parameters are listed as value="$(arg base_frame)" and value="$(arg odom_frame)"...
Am I in the wrong file or is setting arguments and calling them vs. the examples published in the tutorial a change from ROS electric to ROS fuerte?

A:

The answer by jodafo sums up things pretty well. To add just a minor point: The mapping_default.launch file is an example launch file and has some parameters specified using the <arg> tag to facilitate reuse. If your robot for example uses 'my_base_frame' as a base_frame and 'odom' as odom frame you can use the mapping_default.launch file like so in your launch file:
  <include file="$(find hector_mapping)/launch/mapping_default.launch">
    <arg name="base_frame" value="my_base_frame"/>
    <arg name="odom_frame" value="odom"/>  
  </include>

Of course, this is just optional. You can write your own launch file or specify parameters using a shorter form like here.
