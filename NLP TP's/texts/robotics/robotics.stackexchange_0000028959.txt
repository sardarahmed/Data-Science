Q:

Gazebo11 is always using default materials on Heightmaps?

So I am having some problems getting the texture to show up correctly for a heightmap tag. And I am now having doubts about the example and tutorial. Looking at the example worlds/heightmap_dem.world, and it looks like this: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_tutorials/raw/default/dem/files/gazebo_sthelens.png But the sdf has 3 different textures added, that are supopsed to change depending on height. Why does the example show only one texture? Also if I change texture just to bricks, doesn't seem to have any affect. I have tested this in gazebo-11
This is on Ubuntu 18.04, default install with Ogre 1.9.0

A:

There might be a problem in how you are running the example, because I get the following output:

Did you set GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH to point to the location of these textures?
For gazebo9 I need to set the variable as follows before starting the simulation:
GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-9 gazebo <path-to>/volcano.world

Try to find where these textures are located on your machine and make sure GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH points there

So thanks for your reply, and it led me to find 2 issues.

One, the default DEM in gazebo-11 hangs off so far off the side that I didn't notice before, and which has the gradient, but is below the actual volcano, see my screenshot.
I then changed the top material listed int he world file to be bricks.png and it looks exactly the same, and then I even deleted all the material section, and it looks exactly the same, with the same gradient, which I guess is the default.

Found the overall problem, needed to delete the cache as it includes textures.

I've tried the same, and it failed miserably. I used heightmap_dem.world. which comes with gazebo and it complains about the heightmapdata size must be square.
