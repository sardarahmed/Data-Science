Q:

Using ROS for telecomumication

Hi everyone,
I'm using ROS with LAN network to connect my devices in my project. However, now I would like to configure my system out of LAN network. I want to set up a computer to run the Master node and connect to this computer from anywhere that have internet connection. Anyone experiences this kind of problem with ROS? Can you please give me a suggestion to do it?
Thanks
Haquang

A:

Accessing all your ROS nodes that run in a local network from the outside might be tricky since you needed to run everything with a public IP.
I guess one option would be to use a VPN. You can have a VPN server that is publicly available and connect to it from the outside to get into your local network. OpenVPN is easy enough to set up and works quite well.

We use openvpn in the standard PR2 operation for exactly this purpose.
