And as the answer indicates, there is a bug in current rosws. I'll edit my answer to show how to still add the output of roslocate.

A:

The correct command (also used on the wiki page) is:
roslocate info turtlebot | rosws merge -
rosws update

Edit: Unfortunately, it seems like rosws has a bug right now that might prevent you from executing above command. Assuming you are using ROS fuerte, to assume the same effect as above, you can do the following:
roscd
roslocate info turtlebot >> .rosinstall
rosws update
