Q:

Turtlebot calibration(Still waiting for imu/scan)

When I type "roslaunch turtlebot_calibration calibrate.launch", the terminal shows
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820084.864965] Estimating imu drift
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820085.165909] Still waiting for imu
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820085.466922] Still waiting for imu
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820085.767989] Still waiting for imu

Eariler on, it showed
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820084.864965] Estimating imu drift
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820085.165909] Still waiting for scan
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820085.466922] Still waiting for scan
[INFO] [WallTime: 1308820085.767989] Still waiting for scan

Does anybody know what these two messages might suggest? I can't understand the code.
Extra info:
-Using a bumblebee2 camera instead of a kinect
-I am using a MicroStrain 3DM-GX2 IMU for turtlebot, I changed the frame_id to gyro_link and the remapped the topic "imu/data" robot_pose_ekf subscribes  to to "bumblebee2/bumblebee2/imu/data" so that the imu messages can reach robot_pose_ekf. Despite doing this, I'm not sure if the gyro is working properly as I still get "Bad Gyro Calibration" under diagnosis
Let me know if you require and extra information, I'm not too sure what is relevant. Thanks in advance!

A:

I think the calibration tool is expecting the imu under the standard topic. When you remap it, it cannot find that anymore as no one is publishing there.
You can change the remapping back to the original or if you don't want that, change the calibration launch script (or make your own) to remap to your imu topic.
