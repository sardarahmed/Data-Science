Q:

Mixing pcl versions inside ros?

I am trying to use RegionGrowingRGB and other functions which are available in pcl 1.7 but not 1.5. The issue I am having is that 1.7 does not contain the recent patch that was applied to 1.5 (which solved my segfault issue here).
My question is, is there any way I can mix versions in my code? I either want to use 1.5 but be able to call functions implemented in 1.7, or use 1.7 but be able to use the 1.5 version of files which were affected by the patch. Is there any easy way to do this?
I don't think I can simply copy the missing files into the 1.5 directory because I'm sure there are tons of dependencies.

A:

If you are trying to use functionality that is only in PCL 1.7, then it is probably in your best interest to apply the patch from your other question to PCL 1.7 and just use that.
I'm going to guess that it will be significantly easier to fix the bug in 1.7 and build from source than it will be to backport all of the functionality to 1.5.

I was able to get it working by backporting the functions from 1.7 into 1.5. Hopefully there will be a patch to 1.7 before I need to backport any more functions. Thanks anyway.

@dberm22! How did you do that?
