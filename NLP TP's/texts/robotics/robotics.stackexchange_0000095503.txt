Q:

how to disable parameters loaded from yaml from being displayed in terminal?

When you load parameters from YAML in a roslaunch file , they get displayed in terminal, since I am having lot of variables it is getting difficult to debug. Is there anyway to prevent them from being printed in terminal ?

A:

Does adding --no-summary to your roslaunch invocation quiets things down sufficiently?

this behaviour is not specific to parameters from a .yaml. All parameters are printed to the console as part of the Summary.
