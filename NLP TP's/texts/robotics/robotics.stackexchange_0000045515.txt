Q:

Best graphics hardware for large point clouds in rviz

Hi,
I am putting together some desktop computers that will be running ubuntu 12.04. I know from experience that rviz gets very slow when displaying a very large point cloud (or a large number of cubes etc). What should I be looking for in terms of hardware to mitigate this problem?
Is system memory, GPU memory or something else the bottleneck? How about specialized graphics cards such as the nvidia quadro cards (designed for CAD)?
Thanks in advance,
Hugh

How large is very large (both in terms of number of points and rough shape/area/volume)?

A:

Some people know more about this than I do. For good performance you need something that does 3D well on X11 and Linux.
Various nVidia cards are often reported to work well. I am sure some others do, too, but have no experience to confirm it.
