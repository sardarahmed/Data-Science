Q:

What's the easiest/best way to debug remote processes?

Using roslaunch to launch remote processes presents a bit of a challenge in debugging. Typically I use ulimit -c unlimited to cause any crash to emit a stack trace, however it seems as though roslaunch is not running a bash shell that executes .bashrc as no cores are being dumped. The alternative has been launch-prefix with xterm and gdb but obviously that won't work in this situation.
What are some ways to debug remote processes (especially ones that crash before gdb --attach can be called)?
(I'm running electric so env-loader is unavailable)

A:

I ended up using the info on this page:

http://ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/Tutorials/Roslaunch%20Nodes%20in%20Valgrind%20or%20GDB

to set up gnuscreen in my launch file with:
launch-prefix="screen -d -m gdb --args"

And then ssh'd over to the other machine and did
screen -r
