Q:

I want to create a ROS package? how can i?

i want to create two nodes on ROS, and want them to communicate and analyze the robot's local and global reference frames. To be precise i want to examine the position of the robot in x, y and theta coordinates, then send this result to another node which will convert it to global reference frame and then send it to another node. please help me with this.
