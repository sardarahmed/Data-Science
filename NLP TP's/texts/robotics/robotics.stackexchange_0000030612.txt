Q:

how does second term of advertise

Hello.
I'm writing a program that reads data from a laser. This information is published by stage or a bag file.
I know that the second parameter of the function advertise() or subscribe() is the size of the message queue, but how does this value?
for example, I have assigned 50 but in other examples value turns to 10 ,
How does this changes affect the program?
Thanks in advance,
azucena

A:

I believe you're talking about the queue size parameter in roscpp.  From the roscpp overview:
for publishing

queue_size [required]
This is the size of the outgoing
message queue. If you are publishing
faster than roscpp can send the
messages over the wire, roscpp will
start dropping old messages. A value
of 0 here means an infinite queue,
which can be dangerous.

for subscribing

queue_size
This is the incoming message queue size roscpp will use for your
callback. If messages are arriving too
fast and you are unable to keep up,
roscpp will start throwing away
messages. A value of 0 here means an
infinite queue, which can be
dangerous.

Does that mean if the parameter is set to 1, then, only 1 old message is put in queue every time, and next time step, the stored 1 old message is replaced with another one and so on?
