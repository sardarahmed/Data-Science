Q:

kinect no working

Hi,
I follow this tutorial http://learn.turtlebot.com/ but I have a problem with the step 8. I am working with virtualbox, ubuntu 14.04 and kobuki. I didn't make the step 7 because I didn't have a netbook. But I can move the robot...
The picture describe my error:

I'm guessing that the environment for the left terminal is not set correctly? Have you sourced your workspaces setup.bash file? Do you have openni_launch installed?
