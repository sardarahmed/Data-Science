Q:

How to use rviz

Hi guys!
I'm beginner about ros.
Now I installed ros-jade-ros-base on raspberrypi 2(OS raspbian jessie).
I wanna use hector-slam and I could install it.
but I cannot install Rviz .
I tryed install  "rosdep install rviz"
but "Erro: Rosdep cannot find all reqired resources to answer your query
Missing resource rviz
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/jade/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/jade/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/jade/stacks"
was displayed.
Please help for solving this problem.

A:

Did you try to run : sudo apt-get install ros-jade-rviz before you run rosdep install rviz ?
Here , the error is similar to yours. Look at the first answer "rosdep is a tool for installing system dependencies for source packages. It does not install the source for you". It means that you need to install rviz before you will run rosdep install rviz.
I advice you:

to understand what rosdep is
to check the paths (if the error said that rosdep cant find the resources , you need check them yourself. Maybe, you didnt install ros)
to open your terminal and run cd and source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash
to run sudo apt-get install ros-jade-rviz
