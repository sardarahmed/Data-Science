Q:

how to access depth values form /camera/depth/image_raw?

Hey ,
i am using ros hydro and ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) , i need to know how to convert the 8-bit depth data which i receive from kinect in the topic /camera/depth/image_raw to depth of individual points in mm . i know that we have to use encoding and is_bigendian values , but i dont know how to use them . can someone please guide me how to use them .
Note: i didnt want to use point cloud data type because it was a bit complicated when compared to /camera/depth/image_raw and i only need depth data , so i thought this was better . if you feel that in order to access depth data point clouds are better please guide me how to obtain the depth data from point cloud .
Thank you for your patience .
