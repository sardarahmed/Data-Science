Q:

Workaround for Gazebo 2.2.6 not saving changes in obstacles into world file

Hi,
I wonder if there is a workaround to save changes in obstacles into world file in Gazebo 2.2.6. I know it is a bug for this version of gazebo:

and I don't want to upgrade Gazebo to version 4.0 because I'm using ROS Indigo and the recommended version for that version of ROS is Gazebo 2.x:

Best,

A:

You should (and can) use gazebo7 with ROS indigo. Gazebo2 is deprecated, and I highly recommend upgrading.
