A:

Just a guess, but that's probably the result of GetPosition(0) so it would be the position/coordinate (which for revolute joint is angle) of the first axis of the joint. Joints can have multiple axes (revolute2, ball, universal, etc.)

Thank you! You have reason. angle_0 displays the actual joint position in gazebo (radian).
