Q:

Installing MORSE simulator on Ubuntu 12.04

I've been having trouble installing MORSE.
I am trying to install it on Ubuntu 12.04 and on a VirtualBox with Ubuntu 13.04 (I don't need it on a VirtualBox, I'm just trying to make something work). 
On Ubuntu 12.04 I get the following errors at the cmake stage:
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/oferb/opt/morse_build ..
-- will install python files in /home/oferb/opt/morse_build/lib/python3/dist-packages
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR (ADVANCED)
   used as include directory in directory /home/oferb/mnt/svr_home/opt/morse
   used as include directory in directory /home/oferb/mnt/svr_home/opt/morse/src

   used as include directory in directory /home/oferb/mnt/svr_home/opt/morse/testing/robots/pionner3dx

On a fresh VMBox with Ubuntu 13.04, after 'morse check' succeeds, I try "morse create mysim" and get:
adminuser@adminuser-VirtualBox:~$ morse create mysim
usage: morse [-h] [-b BASE] [--name NAME] [-c] [--reverse-color] [-g GEOM]
         [-v]
         {check,edit,run} [scene] ...
morse: error: argument mode: invalid choice: 'create' (choose from 'check', 'edit', 'run')

Any suggestions?
UPDATE:
I've managed to install MORSE on Ubuntu 12.04. Make sure your Blender was compiled with the same version of python (i.e python 3.2.2) that MORSE was compiled in. I used this Blender: 
http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.62

Tips for MORSE on Ubuntu 12.04:
If you're having trouble compiling MORSE, perhaps these can help:

Install python3-dev or python-dev or both (not sure which was needed)
Check which version python3 directs to. If it's the wrong one, you can specify the python version explicitly in cmake. The cmake I used is: "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/oferb/opt/morse -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/python3.3 .."

If you've already managed to compile MORSE, then make sure your Blender was compiled with the same version of python (i.e python 3.2.2) that MORSE was compiled in. I used this Blender: http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.62.
Tips for MORSE on Ubuntu 13.04:
Note that "sudo apt-get install morse-simulator" gives you morse 1.0, but according to morse support, "morse create", which shows up in the tutorials, is something new in morse-1.1. You might want to search for an older tutorial, or install a more recent version of MORSE.
