Q:

Remotely run "rosrun rviz rviz" from launch file

All,
Is there a way I can launch a launch file on the master that runs rviz on my workstation?
If so, could you provide an example?
Thank you!
Andy

Could you clarify your question? From what I understood, you have two machines. Master is running on a machine that is not your workstation (a robot?). You want to be able to automatically run rviz on your workstation when you execute a launch file on the other machine. Is that right?

That is correct. Any thoughts on how to do this?

A:

You should be able to do that with the <machine> tag.

could you expound on that a bit? the machine tag seemed like a logical place to start, but i'm not sure of the syntax to remotely run rviz from my master to my workstation

Examples can be found here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML/machine#Examples
Are there any tags you can't figure out?
