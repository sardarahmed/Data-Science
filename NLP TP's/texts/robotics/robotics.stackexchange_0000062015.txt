Q:

Error "Import Command Not Found" while doing examples of service and client using rospy in Ubuntu 12.04

While doing the example of Service and Client from this page, I am getting an error "Import Command not Found" when trying to run the Server and the Client Nodes. I have checked the code but evrything is acoording to the tutorial. Can somebody please help? I am doing these examples using rospy.
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28python%29
The file is as below :
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy

from beginner_tutorials.srv import *

def handle_add_two_ints(req):
  print "Returning [%s + %s = %s]"%(req.a, req.b, (req.a + req.b))
  return AddTwoIntsResponse(req.a + req.b)

def add_two_ints_server():
  rospy.init_node('add_two_ints_server')
  s = rospy.Service('add_two_ints', AddTwoInts, handle_add_two_ints)
  print "Ready to add two ints."
  rospy.spin()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  add_two_ints_server()

Yes. I have run catkin_make and source devel/setup.bash. Infact, I have been able to sucessfully run the publish, subscribe messages tutorial in python. So, I guess python has been set up properly.
Edit :  python filename.py as suggested by one of the users has worked without any errors.

A:

Have you remembered to do a catkin_make, then source devel/setup.bash before running the examples?
Without the proper environment setup, Python is not going to be able to find the ROS imports.

Edit:
Right. Two things: please don't use answers to answer someone else's answer (:)). Use comments for that. Also: please update your original question with the contents of the file you are trying to run (please use formatting for that: indent every line with 4 spaces).
Lastly: searching for Import Command not Found shows a lot of pages recommending me to make sure I have #!/usr/bin/env python at the top of my file. Do you? The error is probably really import: command not found, right?

Edit2: I've fixed the formatting a bit.

Can you confirm that your file is exactly like this?
How do you exactly run your node?
Have you made your file executable (ie: chmod +x filename.py)?
What is the output if you do python filename.py (change filename.py to the actual name)
Did you by any chance create the file in Windows (running Ubuntu in a VM)? If so, could you try fromdos filename.py and see if the console output changes?

Yes, I have added that line at the top of the file as you can see. But, it is still giving the error. The error is "Import: Command Not Found". Don't know what is missing.

Are the line numbers also in your file? Those are not supposed to be there. Please make sure the question contains a direct copy/paste from the file you are trying to execute.
Comment by ish45 on 2014-08-21:
No. The line numbers are not there in the file.
Comment by ish45 on 2014-08-21:
Thanks. python filename.py command has worked. Strangely, rosrun did not seem to be running. Thanks again.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2014-08-21:
Could you answer all 5 questions please? The fact that python filename.py worked is just an indication that something isn't right with your file, and it is most likely the shebang line (the #!/usr/bin/env python).
Comment by ish45 on 2014-08-21:\

Yes the file is exactly like this
rosrun [package name] [executablefile.py]
Yes I have run chmod +x filename.py
Yes, I have ubuntu installed on VB. fromdos filename.py does not seem to do anything. No output.

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2014-08-21:
But did you use a windows editor to create the file (via a shared folder fi)? fromdos filename.py is not supposed to give any output. It converts line-endings from DOS/Windows files into Unix line-endings. Could you now (after having done fromdos filename.py) try just doing ./filename.py now, or even rosrun pkg filename.py?
