Q:

Correct pose topic could not be subscribed via rviz

I have defined a pose topic as below:
    pose_pub = n.advertise<geometry_msgs::Pose>("new_pose", 50);

But then, after assigning all related fields for position and orientation and also publishing it, I cannot opt for the topic of "/new_pose" under pose message. Instead, it offers me a topic which I never define it (goal(geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)). There is also a warning there saying that "no messages received". However, if I issue "rostopic echo -c /new_pose", there are changing values of position and orientation.
What is the possible culprit for this? I'm on ROS Electric anyway..

A:

Try publishing a geometry_msgs/PoseStamped message, instead of a geometry_msgs/Pose message.  rviz needs the frame ID and time (that's what's in the "stamp") to be able to transform and display data.

How do I define the id, like in laser scanner we can do "scan.header.frame_id = "laser_frame";", when I try pose., it's not there header as a member function..
