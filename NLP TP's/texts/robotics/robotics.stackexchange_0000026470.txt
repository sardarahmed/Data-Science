Hi,
here is the tutorial, but it is currently supported only under Gazebo 1.0.
I am not sure where I read it but I think it will be supported again starting version 2.0
Cheers,
Andrei

That's correct. We fell behind maintaining the character animation code. We will revise the code sometime after June. Please fork gazebo, and start work on the animation code if you need it sooner.

@nkoenig So what would forking actually involve? Updating SDF and writing some new plugins?

Has this been updated to work again? What about animating a non-human character like a simple box?
Comment by nkoenig on 2014-03-25:
It's not working yet. You can animate a box using the Entity::SetAnimation function

I found a tutorial that says it applies "to Gazebo versions 8+" so it appears this feature is making a comeback
