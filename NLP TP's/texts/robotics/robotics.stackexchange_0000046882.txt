Q:

common_rosdeps missing in rosmake source install?

Now that groovy is released, I am trying to install from source and build on Debian.  Everything is working by going through the list, first installing the missing debs from the ubuntu repository, but downloading from source from there.  I got through the wet part of the install (section 2.1) and am building the dry packages now (section 2.2), and there seems to be a problem with dependencies.  Many of the packages are depending on the stack or package of common_rosdeps, which is not a package or stack anymore (and wasn't in Fuerte either, according to the common_rosdeps wiki page.
I am currently solving this problem by commenting out the dependency in the manifest.xml manually, but this workaround isn't desired, I wish I could just follow the instructions.
Is there some step or dependency which is missing for rosdep to find common_rosdeps for the dry packages?
The error that I am getting is similar to this on all the packages depending on common_rosdeps:

    Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
    broken dependency!

A:

See https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/17
Sorry, the maintainer might be on holidays, so it can take a couple of days before this gets fixed. In the meantime you can fix the sources yourself, by just removing the dependency.

Thanks, I thought I was going weird.  I might make a pull request for that later, since I just did it all this morning.
