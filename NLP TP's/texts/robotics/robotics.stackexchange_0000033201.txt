Q:

error while loading shared libraries - wrong ELF class

Hi,
I was running the tabletop_object_detector and despite always previously working, a new error has arisen (potentially as a result of "rosmake"ing some files?):
/code/shared/sr-ros-interface/public_safety/shadow_robot/tabletop_object_detector/bin/tabletop_complete_node: error while loading shared libraries: libpcl_ros_io.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
[tabletop_complete_node-3] process has died [pid 22274, exit code 127].
log files: /home/ros/.ros/log/07310876-b471-11e0-912d-00252274d18f/tabletop_complete_node-3*.log
A google search leads me to believe it's an issue with the fact that it is a 64-bit library when it should be a 32-bit one - any ideas how to fix that? the error is only with "libpcl_ros_io"
Thanks for the help in advance as ever!

Do you have a 32 or 64bit system and what is your other ROS code build on.
