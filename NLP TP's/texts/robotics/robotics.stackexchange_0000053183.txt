Q:

rostopic echo with launch file

Hello,
I would like to do something like this
rostopic echo -p /mytopic > outputfile.txt

with the launch file
Hence, I wrote this in the launch file
<node name="output_topic1" pkg="rostopic" type="rostopic" output="screen" args="echo -p /mytopic > outputfile.txt">
</node>

However, it doesn't work and give me an error like this
Usage: rostopic echo [options] /topic

rostopic: error: you may only specify one input topic

[output_topic1-8] process has died [pid 11643, exit code 2, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/lib/rostopic/rostopic echo -p /mytopic > outputfile.txt __name:=output_topic1 __log:=/home/user/.ros/log/edae921e-f970-11e2-be82-14feb5b7467c/output_topic1-8.log].
log file: /home/user/.ros/log/edae921e-f970-11e2-be82-14feb5b7467c/output_topic1-8*.log

Hey guys,
I am very sorry, I haven't check this for a while. I am no longer using ROS. I believe this was working for me three years ago.
<launch>
  <arg name ="file_name" default="your_bag_file.bag"/>
  <arg name ="dest_path" default="path_to_the_destination"/>
  <arg name ="topic1" default="/topic_name_1"/>
  <arg name ="topic2" default="/topic_name_2"/>
  <arg name ="topic3" default="/topic_name_3"/>
  <arg name ="topic4" default="/topic_name_4"/>
  <node name ="recorder" pkg="rosbag" type="record" output="screen" args="-O $(arg dest_path)/$(arg file_name) $(arg topic1) $(arg topic2) $(arg topic3) $(arg topic4)">
  </node>
</launch>

So....I guess I didn't really manage to get .txt file directly out from the topic(s)
