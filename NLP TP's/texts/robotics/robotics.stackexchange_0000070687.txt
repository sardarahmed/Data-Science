Q:

Rosdep with custom package

Hi everyone!
I have some ROS packages that contain dependencies on several packages that can be installed using rosdep install. On the other hand, one of those dependencies is with a custom package that contains only custom message definitions [my_custom_msgs].
The problem I have is that if I list "my_custom_msgs" as a run_depend / buid_depend, "rosdep install -a" fails saying cannot locate rosdep definition for my_custom_msgs, and, of course, if I remove it from the rund_depend / build_depend, I cannot build this package.
Is there a way of making rosdep install ignore dependencies on custom packages?
Cheers,
Aridane

No, but you can ask it to ignore packages which already exist in the source space of the target workspace (typically used with --from-paths):
rosdep install --ignore-src .. PKG

Anything that is a run_ or build_depend and is already present in the source space will then be assumed to be fulfilling that dependency (and cause rosdep to not go and try to resolve it in the 'official' database).

I realise this answer may be a bit pedantic, but I wanted to (implicitly) point out that there is no such thing as 'custom' packages for rosdep. It either checks all pkgs, or none. The only thing you can do is ask it to ignore things in the source space. The end result is the same though.
