Q:

How to launch stereo view from inside a launch file

I am having trouble with thinking how to do two arguments inside the args type of a node element in the launch file.
Consider wanting to launch the following node inside a launch file:
rosrun image_view stereo_view stereo:=/my_stereo_cam image:=image_rect_color

We would have something like this:
<launch>

 <arg name="stereo" default="multisense_sl/camera"/>
 <arg name="image_view" default="image_rect_color"/>

  <node name="stereo_cam" pkg="image_view" type="stereo_view" args="stereo:=$(arg stereo) image:=$(arg image_view)" >
 </node>
</launch>

I have tried different combinations of arguments formats, quotes, and just can't get it to work. I would appreciate any advice.
Thanks

A:

You should use the roslaunch remap tag
http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/remap
Your launch file should look like this
<launch>

 <arg name="stereo" default="multisense_sl/camera"/>
 <arg name="image_view" default="image_rect_color"/>

 <node name="stereo_cam" pkg="image_view" type="stereo_view" >
     <remap from="stereo" to=$(stereo) />
     <remap from="image" to=$(image_view) />
 </node>
</launch>

This doesn't work, because it appears to be malformed launch file markup. The console error I get is:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token):
