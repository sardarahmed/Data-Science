Q:

"mapping value" error with rosinstall

Hi there,
I'm just installing ROS on my new squeeze Debian following installation guide I find some issue due launching command:

http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no

This is my output:

rosinstall operating on /home/laux/ros from specifications in rosinstall files  http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no
ahhhhhhhh, yaml parse error: mapping values are not allowed here
in "", line 5, column 8
Usage: rosinstall PATH [ ...] [URI]...
rosinstall: error: None

Has anyone any idea about my problem?
Thanks
Laux

A:

I encountered this same problem yesterday, and submitted a bug report. It is fixed now though, so you can just try again.
