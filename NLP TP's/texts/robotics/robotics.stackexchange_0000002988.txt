Q:

Voice control solution for Linux robot?

I wanted to present a voice-controlled robot in my lab's upcoming demo contest. My robot is essentially a x86 Ubuntu notebook resting on top of a two-wheeled platform, so in principle any solution available on Linux would do.
I looked into Julius, but it seems the only comprehensive acoustic model available for it is aimed at the Japanese language â€“ which coincidentally I can speak a little, but apparently not clearly enough to produce anything beyond garbled text. I also tried the Google Speech API, which has a decent selection of languages and worked very well, but requires Internet access. Finally there is CMU Sphinx, which I haven't yet tested, but I'm afraid might have a problem with my accent (I'm a nativa Brazilian Portuguese speaker, and apparently there is no such acoustic model available for it).
Is that all there is to it? Have I missed any additional options? As you may have guessed, my main requirement is support for my native language (Brazilian Portuguese), or failing that, good performance for English spoken with foreign accents. A C++ API is highly desirable, but I can do with a shell interface.

A:

robotergarten gave some really interesting tips, but in the end I decided to roll my own Google Speech client, using sox to record the user's voice. The ability to work without an Internet connection would be nice but is not really required for my demo, and response time is short enough.
