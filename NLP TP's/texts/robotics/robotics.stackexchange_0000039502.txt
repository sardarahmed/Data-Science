Q:

problems with points_and_lines tutorial

I'm new to Ubuntu and ROS and I'm trying to use your tutorial to get myself started with rviz and ROS visualization capabilities.  Ultimately I want to read from SICK LiDAR and visualize the point clouds generated from that.
I am encountering errors trying to run the tutorial here, and hoped you could help me.
First in my ros_workspace I created a package using_markers
Then I created a file points_and_lines.cpp and pasted your code into it
I then copied points_and_lines.cpp into an srv folder in the using_markers package using roscp
This all executed without a problem
Where I began encountering issues was when I tried to execute rosmake on the file as instructed in the tutorial.  14/15 operations execute, but the 15th fails issuing the warning WARNING: Skipped command line arguments: ['points_and_lines.cpp'] because they could not be resolved to a stack name or a package name.
As I said I am new to Linux and ROS and I imagine I have made some strange syntax errror; have you ever encountered this before and how can I resolve it?

A:

Please always copy-paste the exact commands you were using. It's always hard to guess what you did just from the error messages.
It looks like you called rosmake points_and_lines.cpp. This is not how it works. You need to create a ros package, copy your source file into it, edit CMakeLists.txt and create a binary target and rosmake your package. Have a look at this and this tutorial.
Btw. for just visualizing laser or point-cloud data, you don't need to program anything. RViz already has plugins for doing visualizing this data.
