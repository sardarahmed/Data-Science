Q:

RotationTFToEigen no member of tf

Hi guys,
i have some code, which has been written for fuerte and is also compilable under fuerte.  I have to make it runable under hydro. When i compile one of the packages with rosmake, i get the following error:
error: ‘RotationTFToEigen’ is not a member of ‘tf’
error: ‘VectorTFToEigen’ is not a member of ‘tf’

To which namespace does these two now belong? Because in the api it looks like they should be members of tf.
Thanks.

A:

It would appear these functions were slightly renamed:

You'll need to include "tf_conversions/tf_eigen.h"
tf::RotationTFToEigen is renamed to tf::quaternionTFToEigen
tf::VectorTFToEigen is now tf::vectorTFToEigen.

Docs for this header are here: http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/tf_conversions/html/c++/tf__eigen_8h.html
This I believe was part of the overhaul that was done to get rid of the custom version of bullet that was used.
