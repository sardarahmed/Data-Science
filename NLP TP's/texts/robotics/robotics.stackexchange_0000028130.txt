Q:

Debug Gazebo (without ROS) using GDB

How is it possible to use gdb to debug Gazebo.
I do not use ROS, only Gazebo 7 on Ubuntu 14.04 (a bit old but I have other dependencies that require me to use 14.04). I built Gazebo from source and it worked fine. Following the instructions I used the command :
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../

to make sure I will be able to use gdb but when I start the program with gdb and I make the program crash, the stack is always empty. Should this be because I did not configure or start gdb correctly?

Are you starting gzserver and gzclient separately? Running gdb on both?

No I was running both at the same time using gazebo instead of gzserver  and then gzclient as was suggested to me on the other answer below. Thanks for your help!

A:

Instead of using gazebo, you have to use gzserver  <world>, and then, gzclient.
E.g. for debugging gzserver:
gdb gzserver
r <your_world>

Once gzserver is running, you can launch gzclient if you want.
Alternatively, you can just launch gzserver as usual:
gzserver <your_world>

And run gdb on gzclient with:
gdb gzclient
r

Take a look at this related question too.
