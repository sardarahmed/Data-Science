Q:

ImportError: No module named yaml

After i recently installed a new version of python, nothing is working in ros. Every time i get import error saying no yaml found. For example, when i run roscore, i get an error as follows:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/roscore", line 34, in 
from ros import roslaunch

File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib/src/ros/init.py", line 41, in

File "/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/os_detect.py", line 49, in 
import yaml

ImportError: No module named yaml

And yes, i have installed yaml.
"sudo apt-get install python-yaml" gives

python-yaml is already the newest version.

It sounds like your current version of python doesn't have the yaml module installed. Which distribution and which version of python are you using?

A:

When you install the new version of python you need to install the version of python-yaml for that version.  Python libraries are installed into different locations for different versions.  Apt-get install will only install the yaml module for your default python.
If your default python is 2.6 it will install into /usr/lib/python2.6  but if you're using 2.7 it will install need the yaml module installed in /usr/lib/python2.7 which is the python 2.7 version of the library.

You need tp provide more information on how you "installed a new version of python" for us to help you any more.  It sounds like you did that incorrectly.  Note, I'm just guessing at python versions as you have not mentioned what you're using.  Please see http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support

I havent separately installed yaml, it came along with python installation. Also I see yaml folders in /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages as well as /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages. So i am guessing that yaml is installed for 2.7 also. now what does that mean?

If you've yaml present in more than a folder, you've to figure out which is the version you've to use (related to the version of python), and then add that folder in the PYTHONPATH.
At least is what I did to solve the problem.
