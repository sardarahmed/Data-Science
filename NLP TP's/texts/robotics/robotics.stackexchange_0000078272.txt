Q:

Coordinate system in ROS

ROS operates in the ENU Coordinate system(East-North-Up).
In the algorithms for AUV(Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), I need North-East-Down Coordinate system.
What should I do? Change TF or what?

A:

You can always create a new static transform from ENU to NED and use that coordinate system for your AUV.
You can do that in a terminal by running:
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 1.57 0 3.14 world world_ned 30

where world and world_ned are the respected ENU and NED frames.
or simply put the following inside a .launch file:
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="ned_publisher" args="0 0 0 1.57 0 3.14 world world_ned 30"/>

and use the world_ned frame for the AUV
