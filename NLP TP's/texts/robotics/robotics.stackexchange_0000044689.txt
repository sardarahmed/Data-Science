Q:

Python - ROS - Windows

Breaking up several questions I asked here:
http://answers.ros.org/question/45234/multiplatform-dotnet-ros-workflow-redistribution-issues/
Issue #2: Seems like WinRos Sdk is not working with python, as ROS doesn't find my package.
I failed to find a workflow on using ROS with python on windows - the tutorials point only to using cpp modules.
Is it possible to run python ROS in Windows? What should I run to get ROS to find the package (assuming it's written in python)?

A:

I did it with installing python x86_64 in hydro x64 on windows 8.1 using windows sdk 7.1 (before installing it you have to uninstall redistributables 2010 and reinstall afterwards).
