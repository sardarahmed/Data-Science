Q:

Where is setPreempted in actionlib documentation detailled implementation?

I cannot find any notice of setPreempted in the wiki page http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib/DetailedDescription.
I would be glad to add it myself, but don't trust myself.

A:

I maybe have an answer to myself. actionlib Detailled Description page is about ActionServer not SimpleActionServer.
