Q:

svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/executive_trex \ executive_trex command is not working. Please help

I was trying to install trex on my computer. But it is not being installed since the command above in the link http://wiki.ros.org/trex/Tutorials/Getting%20started
does not seem to be working, since I don't see any console output  for quite some time. Please help me.

A:

code.ros.org has long since been taken off-line.
You might want to search github for a fork / clone of that package.

Edit: a quick search doesn't show anything that seems related. trex_executive is also listed on the Abandoned page on the wiki, so I expect that that package is no longer available.

So if I have to install trex, what should I do now ?

I'm afraid I can't help you with that. You could try and search with Google or some other search engine to see if you can find someone who has a fork / copy of it somewhere.
