A:

Yes, it should be, but currently it seems you would have to compile it yourself because it seems to be not in the repository yet.

Hi Christian thanks for your answer, I am not really sure how to build it by source. Is just to clone it in catkin_ws/src and then source the packages with source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash?.
And my other question is ...That packages really works on Jade version?

Yes, that should be it.
And of course you need all the dependencies for the packages, you should be able to install them with rosdep:
