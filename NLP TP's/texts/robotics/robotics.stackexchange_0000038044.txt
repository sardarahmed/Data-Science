Q:

ROS Wiki crumbtrail navigation is odd

I'm having trouble navigating the Turtlebot wiki and it seems mainly due to the crumbtrail structure.
Example page: http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_calibration/Tutorials/Calibrate%20Odometry%20and%20Gyro
Has this crumbtrail: turtlebot_calibration / Tutorials / Calibrate Odometry and Gyro
I would expect that clicking Turtorials would crawl up to the list of all tutorials. Or the root of the crumbtrail would point here:
http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_apps
Perhaps I'm just a wiki idiot? :)

A:

Each tutorial is listed under it's primary package, so if the tutorial is specifically about turtlebot_calibration then the tutorials is placed in the path turtlebot_calibration/Tutorials/your_tutorial. The thing you're calling the "crumb trail" is actually just the wiki path not the crumb trail from whence you came. If you'd like a crumb trail implemented in the wiki, you'll probably need to file a ticket to make it happen.
