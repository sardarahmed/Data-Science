Q:

No transform between base_footprint and base_link

I have an URDF file with a fixed joint between base_footprint & base_link, but robot_state_publisher isn't publishing a tf transform between those 2 links. My understanding is that robot_state_publisher will publish & latch a static transform for fixed joints, but I'm not seeing it in any of my tests.
Details:
My base is irobot create2, using the create_autonomy base; source here: https://github.com/AutonomyLab/create_autonomy
The URDF file has this snippet:
<joint name="base_footprint_joint" type="fixed">
  <origin xyz="0 0 0.017" rpy="0 0 0" />
  <parent link="base_footprint" />
  <child link="base_link" />
</joint>

I can't [yet] upload pictures, but my rqt_tf_tree shows: odom => base_footprint; and base_link => [ left_wheel_link, camera_link, right_wheel_link ]
(I added the base_link => camera_link transform using a static_transform_publisher; it's not in the create_autonomy URDF file.)
I can work around this, but I'm puzzled, and would like to find & fix the bug.
Thanks in advance!

A:

False alarm -- it's working. I tried various debugging tools and learned the pros & cons of each. Here's what I tried:

rosrun tf view_frames doesn't show a link in frames.pdf (thus my confusion)
rosrun tf tf_echo base_footprint base_link does show a link, at time 0.000
rosrun tf tf_monitor base_footprint base_link does show a link, with unknown_publisher
Rviz shows the hierarchy correctly

Hm. The fact that view_frames doesn't show it is troubling. Could ros/geometry#136 be related?

Ah, quite likely. Thanks for the link; it's good to know that this is a regression vs. expected behavior. Also ros/geometry#117?
