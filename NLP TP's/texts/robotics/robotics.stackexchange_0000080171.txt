A:

yes, for sure, you can with python execute the same commands in a scrypt automatically as if you were typing those by hand on a terminal, just refer to the python doc if you need more specific info
you need to import the os lib and then invoke the os.system
example:
import os
cmd = 'mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src'
os.system(cmd)

os.system('catkin_make')
