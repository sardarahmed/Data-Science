Q:

how to set prohibited area for global path plan

hi, All,
on my map, there are crowed places.
how can I set prohibit area so that global path planner would never attempt to route through these areas?

Are you using Hydro?

A:

You can, for example, modify the map manually using your favourite image editing software to englobe with a black polygon the areas that you want the planner to avoid.

I agree on @Martin Peris. I also think that it is the easiest in methods we choose.

hi, Martin,
thanks for the advice.
I have a concern on this.
will the additional lines affect the localization performance when the robot comes to that corner? I am using AMCL for localization.

Ray.

Hi @dreamcase, yes modifying the map in such way might have an impact on the accuracy of localisation depending on what kind of sensor you are using, how big the "exclusion zone" is, the speed of the robot etc... But it might be worth to give it a try
