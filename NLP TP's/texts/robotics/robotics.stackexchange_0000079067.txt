Q:

Ros running on 2 machines, one master, subscriber not getting any message

Hello,
I have the following configuration with two machines running on Ubuntu:
On one machine I run the ros master, and a listener (tutorial one)
On the other I have a talker (again from the tutorial).
I set the ROS_MASTER_URI as specified in http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines.
I am able to ping between the machines, and use netcat to send msgs back and forth from the command lines.
I have allowed port 11311 with ufw.
If I run the talker, the listener doesn't get any message.
If I run rqt_graph it shows the nodes and the topic on which they publish/subscribe. The listener node's color is in red, and nothing changes if I hover on it.
Any idea for what could be the issue?

It's likely that you don't have your ROS environment variables setup correctly. Please edit your question to describe the exact values for ROS_MASTER_URI, ROS_HOSTNAME, and ROS_IP on both machines.

If you are using HOSTNAME, you need to have consistent /etc/hosts files on both machines

A:

Disabling ufw completely solved the problem. The weird thing is that, this was working once without the need to disable ufw.

You can simply allow traffic in your LAN, no need to deactivate ufw completely.
$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.178.0/24
