Q:

where to find resource if I want to better/further understand gazebo::common::events

I want to learn more about Event::connect disconnect
but there is no tutorial on official website
API Documentation about "event" is very short,and I can't understand
http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/api/2.2.1/classgazebo_1_1event_1_1Events.html#ab0fefed82c8ab22f67cf5a3870bcb9ef
where to find resource if I want to better/further understand gazebo::common::events ??
Because I encountered a problem as following:
I have two plugin,
one world plugin "evaluation_platform", another one is model plugin "arm_control"
in _onUpdate() of the world plugin "evaluation_platform",
I use DisconnectWorldUpdateBegin(update_connection) to Disconnect "_onUpdate()" under some condition
I tested these two plugin independently, and they worked well as I want,
but, when I used them together ,things went wrong
_onUpdate() of the world plugin "evaluation_platform" cannot be disconnected
and I guess the critical point is in model plugin "arm_control"
So .I want to learn more about Event::connect & disconnect to find out the problem
Thank you!!

Can you show some of your code so we can try to reproduce the problem?

A:

Here is the API documentation for the event system.
Here is a set of example event definitions.
Basic usage:

Define an event (see gazebo/common/Events.hh for examples).

Create a Connection, which registers a callback to an Event. Make sure to keep the Connection alive (don't destroy it), until you are done.

Trigger the event, and the callback will be run.
