Q:

alternatives to 3d sensors

Is there any way to use a sonar or a sharps Ir sensor in place of a laser scanner or 3d depth sensor like a conenct in the navigation stack? If so please send examples or a very detailed explination.

Yeah. I beleive it is possible and you can run navigation stack with Sharp's IR scanner, although the resolution may not be good as the default methods.
See the following links

This is how its done in Pi-Robot

Just a note, we pretty much abandoned the PML stuff when the Kinect came out -- it works a lot better with ROS navigation than the slow-updating PML did.

do I have to install openni to use the kinect(or other camera depth sensor) with the naviagtion stack?
Comment by achuwilson on 2013-09-24:
yes sure, u need openni, Kinect outputs a pointcloud , then using the package pointcloud_to_laserscan (depthimage_to_laserscan in ROS Hydro), you have to fake it as a laserscanner.

Parallax sells a 1d laser rangefinder on their website, maybe the PML can be used with that.
