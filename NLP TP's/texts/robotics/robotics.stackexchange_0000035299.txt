Q:

svn: E170000: Unrecognised URL scheme for 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/tags/ros-1.4.10'

when rosinstalling on my machine with svn 1.7.1, I get the following error:
svn: E170000: Unrecognised URL scheme for 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/tags/ros-1.4.10'

The workaround is using svn 1.6. Is there any better workaround?

A:

I'd suggest asking about this on svn mailing lists.  It's not really a ROS problem.  A quick google of the error code finds a bunch of other references.  It may be a corrupted working copy, or a corrupted svn version.
