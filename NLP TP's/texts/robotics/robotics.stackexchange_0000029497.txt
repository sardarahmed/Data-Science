Q:

Swissranger with OpenNI

Has anyone worked on using OpenNI tracking algorithms with Swissranger data or any PointCloud data? I am able to obtain PointCloud data published by swissranger but not sure how I can use with OpenNI, well, I'll try to figure out something but in the meantime wanted to see if anyone has worked on it already.

A:

AFAIK, getting the SwissRanger to work with the OpenNI tracking algorithms, i.e. NITE, will be difficult.  To the best of my understanding, the NITE binary uses the PrimeSense-specific driver API, not just the OpenNI API.  In other words, it is not sufficient to be OpenNI-compliant to make use of the NITE capabilities.
I believe Omek Interactive is making their own tracking library that is compatible with the SwissRanger and other devices, but using their software will require a license.
