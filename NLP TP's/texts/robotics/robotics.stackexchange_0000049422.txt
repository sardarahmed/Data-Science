Q:

stereo_image_proc/processor.h: No such file or directory

On Groovy, I get this error when compiling a project, using catkin_make, that uses stereo_image_proc.  I went to /opt/ros/groovy/include/stereo_image_proc, and indeed, it only contains one file: DisparityConfig.h.  Why is this the case?  Where did the other header files go?

A:

Looks like a bug to me. That include file is not getting installed by the catkin CMakeLists.txt.
Please open an issue so this gets fixed.
