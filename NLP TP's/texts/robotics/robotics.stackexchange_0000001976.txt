Q:

Usage of Multibeam 2D Imaging Sonar for AUVs, testing them in the pool environment

I belong to an AUV team at my university. We are planning to have a Multibeam 2D Imaging Sonar (the Blueview P900) for our AUV to detect obstacles underwater.
I have the following questions to ask on the feasibility of testing/implementing such sonars on AUVs.

As we know that these multibeam sonars have multiple reflections arriving at different times from various surfaces while testing in a pool, is there any recommended way to filter these noises in the image obtained from the sonar pings?
Are such sonars in use/test by any other team/organization anywhere else who do pool testing other than a ocean/reservoir testing where multiple reflections are almost zero except the reflections from the obstacle(s)?
Also i would like to know the recommended image processing algorithms that can be implemented/used to detect obstacles from the sonar images.

A:

As you've noted, a pool is one of the worst environments in which to test acoustic sensors; there is nothing to dampen the echoes, and the multipath is quite extreme.
Generally, one of 3 things is done to help mitigate these effects -- the goal being an anechoic test chamber.  

Make the shape of your test tank such that all echoes are reflected into a trap.  The TRANSDEC anechoic pool accomplishes this with its eliptical shape; sounds that hit the bottom are directed toward the edge, which has a "trap" around its perimeter. (I can no longer find the cut-away diagram for that... sorry).

Put foam wedges along the outside of the tank to absorb acoustic energy, similar to the way that recording-studio anechoic chambers are designed. 

Aerate the water to scatter the echoes, a technique described in this paper: "Anechoic aquarium
for ultrasonic neural telemetry".  The use of microbubbles is apparently able to prevent most of the multipath effects.
