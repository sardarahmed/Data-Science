A:

nao_description uses sensor_msgs but does not declare that dependency in its package.xml. I filled a ticket for that: https://github.com/ahornung/nao_robot/issues/17

Where does sensor_msgs actually come in? I couldn't see any reference in the CMakeLists.txt
Comment by William on 2013-11-13:
It is implicitly used in the one of the headers, @Dirk Thomas's issue links to it.
