A:

For the purpose of AMCL (monte carlo localization as described here) on a turtlebot, maps are saved as .pgm's (portable grey maps), where each cell indicates one of three values: occupied, unoccupied, or unknown.You can learn more here. If you have some occupancy data of this room then it's possible to convert it into a suitable .pgm. However, to my mind, there's no package or work done in taking a picture of a room and converting it into a .pgm...
