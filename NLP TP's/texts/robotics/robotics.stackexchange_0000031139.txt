Q:

uvc_camera, load calibration file

Hi there,
I'm relatively new in the ros community.. so at the moment I am playing around with ros and image processing to get into it..
the problem I get is the following: the uvc_cam node seems to be unable to load my calibration file.. so image_proc reports: [ERROR] [1303148787.949737953]: Rectified topic '/mono/image_rect_color' requested but camera publishing '/mono/camera_info' is uncalibrated
any ideas? here an extract out of my launch file:
  <node ns="mono" name="camera_node" pkg="uvc_camera" type="camera_node" output="screen" >
    <param name="device"  value="/dev/video0" />
    <param name="fps" value="30" />
    <param name="width" value="640" />
    <param name="height" value="480" />
    <param name="camera_info_url" type="string" value="file:///home/blub/ros/camtesting/calibration_camera.yaml" />
  </node>

  <node name="image_view_raw" pkg="image_view" type="image_view" respawn="false" output="screen">
    <remap from="image" to="/mono/image_raw"/>
    <param name="autosize" value="true" />
  </node>

  <node ns="mono" name="proc" pkg="image_proc" type="image_proc" output="screen" >
  </node>

  <node name="mono_view" pkg="image_view" type="image_view" output="screen" >
    <remap from="image"  to="mono/image_rect_color" />
  </node>

another strange thing is, that the calibration script did't save the calibration to the URL above but into the tmp folder..
Thanks for you Help,
Ulli

A:

I believe this was a bug that caused trouble whenever the name="..." attribute was specified for a node. It should be fixed in camera_umd version 0.1.2 (debs are available).
