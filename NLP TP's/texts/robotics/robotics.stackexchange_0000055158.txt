Q:

roswtf errors after following Install and Configuration of ROS Tutorial

I'm new to ROS so I'm following the beginner tutorials. After following the install and configuration steps for my system (ubuntu 13.04), I get the following message from roswtf;
==============================================================
Static checks summary:

A:

I had the first error as well, and I found that it is fixed if you go to /opt/ros/hydro/stacks and then do
mkdir stacks

then you will no longer have the error pop-up. I am relatively new to ROS so I don't know what the folder was for or what this quickfix will do in the long run, but it fixes it for now.
I assume the second error could be fixed via a similar method, but i'd make sure all of your python stuff is up to date on your system before that.
