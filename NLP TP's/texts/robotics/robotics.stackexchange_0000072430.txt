Q:

What are the units of Odometry/orientation.z/w and Twist.angular.z fields?

I an new to ROS and am trying to understand the units in which the values in the Odometry.orientation.w and z fields and what do they represent. I am trying to rotate a turtlebot by a specific number of degrees. Is there a way to achieve it as I am able to set only angular velocities and whose unit I don't know either.

A:

Orientation is in terms of Quaternion, not Euler angles. You can check http://answers.ros.org/question/220333/what-do-x-y-and-z-denote-in-mavros-topic-mavrosimudata_raw/#220356
For unit conventions you can check REP-0103. As you can check, angular velocity is rad/s if the code you use is convenient with REP-0103.
