Q:

knowrob visualisation_canvas

I'm trying to get the visualisation_canvas to run, as described in the knowrob basics tutorial. However, I keep getting this error message:
[1]  ?- visualisation_canvas(C).
ERROR: Unhandled exception: jpl:jFindClass/2: Undefined procedure: jpl:jni_func/3
Tried it on cturtle and diamondback (on 2 different machines), same result.
Any hint would be much appreciated. Thanks!

A:

The problem's resolved. A former installation of SWI-Prolog seems to have caused the trouble. Uninstalling SWI-Prolog and reinstalling knowrob's dependencies helped in my case.
