Q:

Can I reconfigure robot speed when navigation?

Hello everyone, now I have a task about navigation.
I want my robot to have different speeds in different environments.
Just like this:

At corridor : 0.5m/s

At parlor : 0.25m/s

etc...

Now my question is how to reconfigure my robot's speed when navigation?
This is my design step:

First, Navigate to a place.

When it finished, reconfigure robot speed.

Then navigate to next place.

Can anyone tell me if it is possible?
Or there are other way to do this?

A:

You could use dyanmic_reconfigure to change (Maximum) velocities on the fly, if it is implemented in the respective local planner.
E.g.

base_local_planner has max_vel_x and min_vel_x dynamically configureable.
dwa_local_planner seems to have the same.

For other local planners, you'd have to check.

EDIT
There is a python Client.
And it seems that a C++ Client has been merged as well, though there is no documentation.

@TifferPelode Can you please mention how you adjust the values programmatically rather than using the GUI?

@violator this is what the clients above are for. You change the values programmatically using the links in the edit I provided above. Does this answer your question?

@mgruhler Yes. It does. And It works.
