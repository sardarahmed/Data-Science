Q:

how to publish (fake) odometry i.e, getting odometry without robot?

I would like to use the odometry data over rgbdslam package. I do not have any robots. So, Is there any possiblity to publish a fake odometry (for the known distance)?
Thanks in advance for the reply.

A:

One way is to write your own node that will publish fake data. Tutorial for odometry publisher can be found at:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom

It requires some changes, but will give you possibility to publish automaticly whatever you need, without any user input. Other option is to use turtlesim and move fake robot around with a teleop (using keyboard or joystick). It will publish odometry for you, so there is no need to wirte any additional code, but you need to keep interacting with robot to generate change in published position.
