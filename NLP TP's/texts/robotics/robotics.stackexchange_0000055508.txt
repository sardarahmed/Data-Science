Q:

Is there a Catkin unit test report XMLT (for pretty printing)?

Has anybody come up with XMLT files to convert gtest/nosetest XML reports to a more human-readable form? I find it hard to tell at a glance if all tests passed, so something condensed and uniform would be nice. (E.g. if all lines are green, then I don't need any more detail.)

A:

For a (ascii) summary of (failing) tests you can call catkin_test_results path/to/test/results.
