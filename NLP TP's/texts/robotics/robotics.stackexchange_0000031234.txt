Q:

Can gazebo_ros actually use bullet?

I've seen references to bullet and its use with gazebo, but haven't seen any specific information on whether its work in progress or its actually possible now.
Anyone know if its possible and how to do it, or where to find instructions for doing so?

According to the Gazebo roadmap, full Bullet support is a long-term goal.
