Q:

Differential Drive Robot on uneven surfaces

So I am building a differential drive robot and I want it to autonomously drive in a straight line on an uneven surface. I know I need a position and velocity PID. As of now, I am deciding on which sensors to buy. Should I use optical encoders, accelerometers, or something else?
I wanted to go with accelerometers due to the error encoders would face due to slippage, but I am not sure.
Some enlightenment would help!

A:

Get a good IMU you can communicate with over i2c.  Make sure it has an accelerometer and a gyroscope.  Use these two sensors to calculate your heading, and then correct accordingly to make sure you are heading straight.   
Here's an example of a nice IMU: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10121
Sparkfun has created an arduino library for that particular sensor that will make calculating heading easy peasy.  Good luck!
