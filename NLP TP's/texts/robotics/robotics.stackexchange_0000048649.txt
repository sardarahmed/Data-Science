Q:

InteractiveMarker hook into mouseover/hover?

Is it possible to execute a callback for an interactive marker on mouseover? I can capture and click event and use it just fine, but I'd like to be able to capture a mouseover (or hover) event as well. The markers already highlight on mouseover, so I'm hoping it isn't difficult. Does anyone know how to do this? I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Groovy.

That's not supported. What do you want to do with this?

I'm using Rviz to make a GUI that allows people to hand label point cloud data. I take a point cloud and build a PCL octree, then, for each leaf in the octree, I draw an interactive marker. Right now I have written a panel for the user to select a label, and what I would like is for the user...

...to be able to "paint" the markers with the selected label by just running the mouse cursor over the markers containing the point cloud points to be labelled. As it stands, I can click the markers individually, but that's time consuming. Would you have any suggestions?

Maybe this (undocumented) tutorial gets closer to what you want: https://github.com/ros-visualization/visualization_tutorials/blob/groovy-devel/interactive_marker_tutorials/src/selection.cpp

Otherwise, you might want to look into writing an RViz plugin that provides it's own labeling tool that is similar to the 'Selection' tool.

Ah, that looks like it might be promising. Thanks!
