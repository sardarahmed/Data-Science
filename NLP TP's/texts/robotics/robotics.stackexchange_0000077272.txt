Q:

failed to roslaunch remotely on another computer

I am trying to remotely launch realsense from another computer. Pinging the remote PC has no problem. I can also execute the launch file from remote computer with roscore on my current PC successfully. I tried to set up a launch file like following:
<launch>
    <machine name="croc3up1" address="138.25.248.87" user="croc3up1" password="croc3up1" env-loader="~/catkin_ws/src/croc3_robot/config/env.sh" default="true"/>
    <!-- just testing a simple node-->
    <node machine="croc3up1" pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="virtual_joint_broadcaster_0" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 link0 world 100" />
</launch>

I also tried this:
<include file="$(find realsense_test)/launch/realsense_test.launch" machine="croc3up1"/>

However I am getting the following error message:
... logging to /home/johnyang/.ros/log/25f83d3e-a7db-11e6-bef6-086266c7c72e/roslaunch-johnyang-ubuntu1404-7206.log

[138.25.248.87-0] killing on exit
remote roslaunch failed to launch: croc3up1
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

env.sh looks like following:
export ROS_HOSTNAME="138.25.248.87"
export ROS_IP="138.25.248.87"
. ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh
exec "$@"

It sounded like the env.sh file is executed properly and ssh connection is established correctly. However it seemed having difficulty finding the the correct launch file to execute (throwing "is not a launch file name" error). The launch file is definitely put on the 2nd PC.
If I just manually ssh into the 2nd PC and I can perform all the roslaunch straight away (since I setup source ~/catkin/devel/setup.bash in ~/.bashrc etc already).
Any clue why using the "machine" tag to remotely start launch files does not work here? (I'm using ROS Jade)
Thanks.

I found something suspicious in the terminal output.  There is a space between "http://138.25.248.22" and ":33411"... which is probably the major reason of the error. Maybe there is a bug in the source code for ROS Jade

A:

I figured out eventually after going through the log and source code of roslaunch. It's actually because I had "export ROS_HOSTNAME=hostname -I" instead of "export ROS_HOSTNAME=138.25.248.22". This will then not create that extra space behind the server uri.

If you are going to use IPs, please consider setting ROS_IP instead of ROS_HOSTNAME. See wiki/EnvironmentVariables - Node Environment Variables - ROS_IP/ROS_HOSTNAME for some info on those variables.

That's a good point. Thanks.
