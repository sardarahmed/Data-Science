Q:

visp_camera_calibration doesn't write the calibartion.ini file

I do all the proceding told on the tutorial for the calibration of an external camera from the ROS wiki.
The camera i'm trying to calibrate is the one on the Parrot ARDrone.
Everything works fine and after calling the calibrate service I get the stdDevErrs output as the tutorial says, but the calibration.ini file isn't saved anywhere.
Any ideas as what might be the problem?
Thanks!!

I posted your question on visp-user mailing-list, I hope the package authors will be able to answer it directly :)

A:

As explained on the tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/visp_camera_calibration/Tutorials/CalibrationExperimentalCamera, the calibration.ini file should be in your $HOME/.ros directory
