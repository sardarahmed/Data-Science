Q:

funny behaviour or what - dc motor control

I'm trying to control the speed of this motor, with this motor driver and pic16f690. 
pwm in my program
5 kHz frequency (0.2 ms period)

Starting with 50% duty cycle the motor doesn't run.
But moving from say, 80% to 50% (i.e. program my PIC with 80% duty cycle, and then re-program it with 50%), the motor will run at 50% (of course at a lower speed). I consider this funny. Anyone to explain this?
my motor powered by 5V.

A:

If you're saying that it always starts with 80% PWM, but never with 50%, but it runs with 50% after starting, then you're just starting to learn the joys of working with a system that has significant stiction (AKA starting friction).
Somewhere buried in this document is a description, along with some prescriptions of how to deal with it in a closed-loop control system:
