Q:

Can a frame be both parent_id and child_id?

I'm using odom as parent_id for base_link and child_frame_id for map tf in the respective launch files. Will it cause any issues in my tf tree?

As long as your overall TF tree doesn't have any loops or multiple roots then this shouldn't be a problem at all.

I would go even further: how would we ever create tree structures (or any linked structures) if frames can't be both parent and child?

A:

No, it won't cause any issues, that is exactly how hierarchy trees work.
Me myself am a father because I have children, but at the same time I am a child because I have a father.
Same for the example you describe.
