Q:

404 on source.yaml rosdistro file

Hello,
I am following the instructions on the ROS Wiki for setting up a pre-release test for a catkin package.  In several places in the documentation including Step 3 , reference is made to a source.yaml file.  However, no such file appears to exist anywhere in the rosdistro package.  Consequently, I'm not sure how to even get started.
Thanks!
patrick

A:

The file is not called source.yaml anymore but distribution.yaml. I have updated the wiki page accordingly: http://wiki.ros.org/action/diff/bloom/Tutorials/PrereleaseTest?action=diff&rev1=22&rev2=23
