Q:

rosjava external sources

Hi,
I'm developing a rosjava package in eclipse, and I need  to use some java classes that I am developing in another non-ros java eclipse project. Does anybody knows how I could configure these dependencies properly in my rosjava project?
I've tried with the rosjava-src tag in the manifest and giving an absolute path for the location of my external java sources dependencies, but that path doesn't seem to be correctly resolved. I do prefer not to add these classes to a jar file because they're still under development.
Thank you for any idea

Thank you Juan Antonio and Damon for your ideas. I've finally committed to maintain these dependencies for other Java sources in the .project eclipse file, it is easier since I develop only from within eclipse, and the debugging works really nicely.
