Q:

How can i simulate a car with ROS and Gazebo?

I want to create my own robot car model and simulate, the steering, the power unit, etc.
I'm a novice in ROS and Gazebo.
Please tell me about this problem detail. And Where could i find a documentation for dummies or Step by Step?
Thanks.

A:

One of our students created an experimental art_gazebo_plugins package for the ART autonomous vehicle in the sandbox branch of the utexas-art-ros-package repository.
That implementation is specific to our vehicle and not complete, but it does run and may be helpful, given the lack of good gazebo documentation.
There is probably enough demand within the ROS community to justify creating some shared packages for car-like simulation and navigation. As always, the challenge is creating a team with the interest and time to make it happen.
UPDATE: there is now a ROS Ackermann group for defining interfaces and sharing code.

Has there been an update to this in the last 3.5 years? We have a car-like vehicle that currently uses JAUS and are looking to move to ROS. It's an outside vehicle with GPS/IMU/Velodyne, teleop and some autonomy. We like the idea of ROS but don't quite know how to start for this type of vehicle.

@Jim Rothrock has some tools, see http://answers.ros.org/question/10265/gazebo-ackermann-car-simulation/  and https://github.com/jim-rothrock/gazebo_ros_pkgs .

Took a look at the ackermann_vehicle metapackage: http://wiki.ros.org/ackermann_vehicle?distro=hydro
