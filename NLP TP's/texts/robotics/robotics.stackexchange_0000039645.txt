Q:

OpenCV program doesnt start the camera

Hi, I recently installed ROS Electric, and now I'm trying to use OpenCV with it, I followed certain tutorials as this one Working with ROS and OpenCV (no sure if anyone else tried this too) ... Thing is, my built-in camera worked fine when i launch this .launch program:

    
        
        
        
        
    

(Refer to the part **Test the launch script** in the link above)
It does turn on, and writing this in terminal
$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw
I can see the image, but when I write my .cpp program for using OpenCV and I run it (refer to the part Write the code for image processing), my camera doesn't turn on, it doesnt show an error or anything it just stays there ... I have tried w another webcams and same thing happened. Does anyone have a clue why isn't running
Thanks

A:

You still have to run uvc_cam node.
The code you are talking about uses image transport in another node to grab the images from the ucv_cam node and process them. These are two different nodes working together ... one to grab images from your camera and one to process them.
