Q:

Any use case of communication of nodes on different netowkrs?

I want to know if there are use cases that nodes on different(distributed) networks communicate with each other, using single ROS Master.
It's like:

PC A on Network A: ROS Master and node A(A1, A2...)

PC B on Network B: Node B(B1, B2...)

(PC C on network C: Node C)

I heard Rapyuta was true of this case.
If you know something about this, let me know!

Rapyuta is not exactly what you mention as it is not using a single ROS master. However, it might still be useful for your case: http://rapyuta.org/

A:

ROS can communicate across networks as long as they are routeable.
Many users use a VPN to connect robots across private networks.
