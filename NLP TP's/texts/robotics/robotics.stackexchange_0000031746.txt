Q:

no module named yaml

Dear ROS Team,
I have tried to install ROS on my Mac after having installed Macports etc as explained, and after typing "rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no" in the terminal, I get the error message: ImportError: No module named yaml.
Do you have a hint?

A:

Found that the soln described here works. Note that I had to open a new window to get the rosinstall command to work after taking all these steps - apparently, the path still wasn't being rehashed properly.

It's ugly, and I don't like removing system files - but it worked.
