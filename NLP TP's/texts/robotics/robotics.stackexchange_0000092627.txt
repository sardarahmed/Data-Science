Q:

Can cartographer publish odom?

Is there any way to have the cartographer publish the odom topic in localization-only mode? I'm quite happy with the 2D localization results it provides, compared to other ROS methods using my very noisy IMU and slipping encoders, but I don't get the odom from it, despite provide_odom_frame set to true. Is it even supposed to work?
Thank you!
Alex

A:

Solution/workaround: added a tf -> odom mapping node as suggested by @koby here: https://answers.ros.org/question/319521/why-cartographers-odom-from-tf-contains-much-noise/. Seems to work well.
