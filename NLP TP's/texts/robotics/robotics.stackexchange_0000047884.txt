Q:

How do I run unit tests for a catkin package?

The camera_info_manager package was converted to catkin, but I suspect an error: rostest is listed as a <build_depend> and a <run_depend>, rather than a <test_depend>.
I checked out an image_common catkin workspace using wstool. I can build those packages with catkin_make, but have not been able to figure out how to run the camera_info_manager unit tests.
I tried make test in every directory I could think of:
$ make test
make: *** No rule to make target `test'.  Stop.

Google has not revealed any answers. So, how is this done, now?
EDIT: I noticed that <test_depend>gtest</test_depend> was missing and added it. Still not running.

A:

I believe the make targets are:

make tests to build them
make run_test* for each test (you can tab complete the targets)
make run_tests runs all tests
