Q:

python node bad interpreter

the c++ version is working but python shows the following :
rosrun hello_world talker.py

/opt/ros/lunar/bin/rosrun:
/home/kamal/catkin_ws/src/hello_world/script/talker.py:
usr/bin/env: bad interpreter: No such
file or directory
/opt/ros/lunar/bin/rosrun: line 109:
/home/kamal/catkin_ws/src/hello_world/script/talker.py:
Success

this could be a noob doubt but i didnt get any working solution

A:

The first line of your python node tells the OS which interpreter to use to run it (in this case, python). I suspect you have a typo there; the first line should be:
#!/usr/bin/env python
