Q:

wheel odometry and laser_scan_matcher

Hello . I am using ros_arduino_bridge.
https://github.com/hbrobotics/ros_arduino_bridge
Can I  connect directly the ouput of ros_arduino_bridge (odom message) to laser_scan_matcher ( http://wiki.ros.org/laser_scan_matcher ) ???

A:

Assuming you have a supported motor controller and encoder interface, the ros_arduino_bridge package publishes wheel odometry data on the /odom topic.  Since the laser_scan_matcher has the option of subscribing to the /odom topic to augment the laser scan matching, then the answer is "yes".

then, no need doing about covariance calculating for output of  ros_arduino_bridge , isnt it ?
Comment by Pi Robot on 2016-01-27:
The ros_arduino_bridge package does not publish covariance values.  I don't know if laser_scan_matcher requires covariance when subscribing to /odom.

I am sorry but I do not know about covariance. you think does it (below link) requires covariance ?

Looking at the code at https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/scan_tools/blob/indigo/laser_scan_matcher/src/laser_scan_matcher.cpp, it does not look like wheel odometry covariance is used.  However, perhaps someone else on the forum knows for sure.

Hi, howw did you connect the output of the ros_arduino_bridge to the laser scan matcher? Thanks @osmancns
