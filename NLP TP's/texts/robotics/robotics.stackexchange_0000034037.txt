Q:

prosilica camera_info frame_id in gazebo off?

The frame_id in the camera_info topic in gazebo (diamondback) is high_def_frame. I believe it should be high_def_optical_frame instead, as it is on the real PR2.

Unfortunately, all urdf optical frames in pr2 predates rep 103, hence, they are all *_optical_frame.  Might not be worth the effort to switch all of them at this point.
Comment by joq on 2011-09-01:
Are you sure it's not high_def_frame_optical? That would follow REP 103.

A:

Yes, you've caught a typo, please see ticket/patch, awaiting next patch release for diamondback.  Thanks.
