Q:

How to install run Gazebo dev trunk?

Hi
Can anyone tell me the best way to install the Gazebo dev trunk for use with ROS please?
Ideally I could leave the Debian package installed, so updates will work ok.
Then just switch between the two when I load a simulation.
Thanks.
Update: I'm switching back to ROS Electric if that makes any difference.

A:

Switching back to Electric is likely to break things.
What you want to do is install gazebo (trunk) into your ROS workspace, build it, and then make sure your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set up correctly, so that you find the version you built from source.
The link for the source download is here (bulleted list, not too far down). Take a look at the rosinstall and rosws tools if you aren't familiar with building from source.
