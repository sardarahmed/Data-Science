Q:

How does the Makeblock threaded slot work?

I've been looking into a Makeblock robotics kit but have found no information on the web that comes from end-users, and one of the main advertised features is not clear to me:  The slot threads shown below are straight, while the screw thread that will mate with them is angled.  Is there just very little contact between screw thread and rail thread vs. regular screw hole threads?  Or would the screw want to rest angled somewhat- and then the head would not be flush with the rim of the rail?  Or would the screw deform the aluminum rail if over-torqued?
This is a close up picture of the slot with screws:

A:

It's a clever and attractive design, but it's mechanically weak.
The mating area between the screw and grooves is small, so the pitch angle of the threads isn't as much of a problem. The grooves on opposite sides are offset by half a thread so the screw has less of a tendency to tilt. Mechanical clearance and deformation of the parts is enough to compensate for the remaining geometric mismatch.
The screw will have a strong tendency to strip out the grooves when torqued. This is already a problem with threading into softer materials like aluminum; that's why they invented threaded inserts. It's even worse when only a small fraction of each thread carries any load. The grooves should only be considered suitable for light loading and gentle torquing.
