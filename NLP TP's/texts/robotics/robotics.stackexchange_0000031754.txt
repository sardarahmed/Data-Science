Q:

Roslaunch recursive parsing

Does anyone have some code or utility that will let me use 'cat' or 'grep' recursively on ros launch files?  I have launch files that include other launch files, and it can be quite a hunt to find things sometimes.

A:

That's a good feature request.  I went ahead and implemented it in r13774. You should be able to apply a patch to your tree that does:
roslaunch --files 
which will print:

[included files...]
