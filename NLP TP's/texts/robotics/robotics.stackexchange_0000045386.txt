Q:

rosdep update error

When I tried rosdep update I get this:
$ rosdep update
reading in sources list data from /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d
Hit https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/osx-homebrew.yaml

ERROR: unable to process source [https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml]:
    Failed to download target platform data for gbpdistro: invalid repo spec in gbpdistro data: You must update to a newer rosdep version by calling..sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-rosdep (make sure to uninstall the pip version on Ubuntu)
updated cache in /home/wagnelib/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache

so, I have followed the advice removed the pip version of rosdep and:
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-rosdep
 ...
python-rosdep is already the newest version.

A:

For me this works. Maybe just try running it again?
Other than that check what which rosdep, rosdep --version and apt-cache policy rosdep give you. I have 0.10.7.

Finally, I have removed the python-rosdep package and again installed in and now it works.
