Q:

Corrected Odometry from GMapping / Karto?

I've been building (2D) maps using GMapping, and visualizing the results in rviz. So far, so good. However, the tf frames that are available (/odom -> /base_link, most importantly) represent the original, dead-reckoning, uncorrected odometry.
So far as I can tell, GMapping and Karto don't publish an extra, "corrected odometry" frame that I could use to visualize the current best hypothesis about the robot's pose.
Have I missed something, or do I need to put in a feature request?
