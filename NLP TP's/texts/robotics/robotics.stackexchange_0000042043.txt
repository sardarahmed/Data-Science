Q:

Can't build fuerte in fedora; fails on rosdep

I am following the fedora installation tutorial for fuerte (here) and I got to the part where I run rosdep update, and I get many lines like this:

laser_assembler: No definition of [pcl] for OS [fedora]

For the dependencies:

opencv2
python-qt-bindings
pcl
ros

Is this a configuration problem on my end, or is it a known issue with ROS on fedora? I'm using Fedora 16, 64-bit.

A:

Fedora does not necessarily have all rosdep rules defined.  You may need to contribute some rules.
