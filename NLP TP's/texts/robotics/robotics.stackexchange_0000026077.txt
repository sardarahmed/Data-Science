Q:

Model falls through heightmap terrain

Hi,
I'm using gazebo 1.5 on gentoo linux.  I installed it from dev branch about a month ago.
When I create a terrain using a heightmap and try to insert a model onto it, the model falls through the terrain and out of sight.  I've tried it with the pioneer robots and with various other models - same result.  However, with the Brickbox, Bookshelf, and Cabinet, they stay where I put them.  I don't know how to solve this problem.

It looks like you scaled the heightmap in the visual but not in the geometry.
