Q:

How to use the .so file in my projectï¼Ÿ

I followed the "beginner tutorial" to study the ROS, now I want to build a new project which communicates with the robot by using the Serial Port. I searched the packages and found the "cereal_port", I downloaded the source , compiled and got the "libcereal_port.so" file. I used the Eclipse to develop the code and tried to find how to use the .so file in Eclipse, however, I added the .so in the /lib and modified the project configuration which added the file as a library, it can't be found, the "#include <cereal_port/CerealPort.h>" gave an error.
Could anyone please help me?

A:

For the 'cereal port' download and install (with rosmake) this package == > http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/stacks/serial_communication/. I have used this to work with my Roomba 560 robot (https://github.com/Arkapravo/roomba_500_ROS_drivers).Hope that solves your problem. Just a tip, please mention the version of ROS (and other softwares, Eclipse in your case) in your future postings here.
