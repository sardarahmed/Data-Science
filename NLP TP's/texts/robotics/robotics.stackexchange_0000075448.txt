Q:

Roslaunch and env variables for HOSTNAME

In my launch file I want to read the hostname from user input and when it is missing, it will use the local hostname by default.
I use this line in my launch file
<arg name="hostname" default="$(env HOSTNAME)" />

When doing echo $HOSTNAME in the terminal, the value is set, however when I run roslaunch it complains that there is no HOSTNAME variable.

A:

HOSTNAME is a special environment variable that is not available for shell scripts.
adding
export HOSTNAME

to my .bashrc fixed the problem.
