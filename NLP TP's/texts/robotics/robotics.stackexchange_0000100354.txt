Q:

PWM control (Rosbot 2.0)

Hi, I'd like to know how to control the PWM signal directly.
The motor is controlled by cmd_vel by using ros node but how to control the PWM without cmd_vel msg?

A:

The Rosbot 2.0 uses an ASUS Tinker board for low level control. You have the ability to read PWM from the servos but you can also interact with the firmware via rosservice to set PWM: https://github.com/husarion/rosbot-stm32-firmware
$ rosservice call /config "command: 'CSER'
>data: 'V:0 S:1 E:1 P:20000 W:1000 '"

I'm already read the material  But I want to control the DC motor for the wheels.
Can I have any information for DC motor control for Rosbot 2.0?
