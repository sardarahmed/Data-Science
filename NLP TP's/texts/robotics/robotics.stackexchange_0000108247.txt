Q:

How to easily check how many laser scanner samples are being generated by the ray plugin?

Is there an easy way to check how many laser scanner samples are being generated by the ray plugin? I know I can check it in the URDF, XACRO or SDF but I want to confirm it by looking at the messages.
I'm aware that I can create a node that subscribes to the /scan topic and do .size() to the vector of msgs. I wonder if there's a built-in option.

A:

If I understood correctly, you are trying to count how many lasers are being used in the ray plugin just checking the topic published with a LaserScan msg.
I think you could use the angle_min and angle_max with angle_increment in order to know the samples used.
In case you want to know the actual samples in each message (perhaps some laserscans are being skipped by inf values or whatever) I find interesting to use the flag --noarr. This flag omits the arrays and just shows the type  of the data as well as the length of the arrays (in this case, check ranges). The use of it would be as simple as:
rostopic echo /<scan_topic> --noarr
Resulting in:

header:
  seq: 276
  stamp: 
    secs: 29
    nsecs: 851000000
  frame_id: "os0_lidar"
angle_min: 0.0
angle_max: 3.14159011841
angle_increment: 0.00870000012219
time_increment: 0.0
scan_time: 0.0500000007451
range_min: 0.10000000149
range_max: 20.0
ranges: "<array type: float32, length: 362>"
intensities: "<array type: float32, length: 0>"```
