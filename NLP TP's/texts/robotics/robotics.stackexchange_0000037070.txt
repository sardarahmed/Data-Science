Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: SLAM in gazebo

I am trying to obtain SLAM maps using gazebo, I followed this tutorial.
Using the command,

roslaunch erratic_navigation_apps demo_2dnav_slam.launch

and

rosrun erratic_teleop erratic_keyboard_teleop

The teleoperation works nicely (using WASD keys), though somewhat slowly. However, I am not able to obtain any maps. I have previously used stage with gmapping & mapserver to obtain SLAM (as a pgm image file), however gazebo seems rather different.
Also, hoping that this method for the SLAM map starts to work - can this method, specifically meant for the erratic robot be used for other robots ?
Any help is most appreciated.

UPDATE: Solved it ! scroll down for my answer

try to use rviz for looking it.

@noonv You are from Kalingrad, must be a romantic place ..... Kant's city ! ... :-) .... I do recall the '7 Bridges of Konigsberg' problem, which is attributed to Euler ! :-)

@noonv though that is not what I want, but your suggestion is sure worth a try - Thank you ! .... but probably it will not be a true SLAM mapping ! ..... I will try it and see !

sure, but you could save it via "rosrun map_server map_saver -f /tmp/my_map"

@noonv the rviz map is not what I am looking for, I want a pgm map - a SLAM like map, the rviz map vanishes with time.
