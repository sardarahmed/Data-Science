Q:

setting workspace for rosws?

Hi,
I need to install a package for armhf that is not yet available for armhf. So I've been reading the tutorials on rosinstall, rosdep, roslocate and rosws. When I do sudo roslocate info arm_navigation --distro=groovy | rosws merge -, I'm asked to give a target workspace. But the package I want to install from source is not mine and should be install into /opt/ros/groovy/stacks. So what should the required workspace be then? /opt/ros/groovy/stacks ?
Thanks...
EDIT:
Here's the output from the point where it goes wrong:

Have you done an sudo apt-get update recently? This doesn't appear to be a ROS specific issue.
Comment by hvn on 2013-10-28:
Yes, I did. To be certain, I did the update again, then the rosdep install, and it stops again at the libtbb-dev error. For completeness, I'm running Ubuntu12.04 armhf with groovy.

This could be a problem with the armhf debs being stale? @ahendrix might know something about this.

I know he is the maintainer of ros for arm. How can he be approached ?
Comment by William on 2013-10-28:
I live with him :D, I'll ask him to review this question.
Comment by hvn on 2013-10-30:
Can you either of you give me a follow-up ?

A:

libtbb-dev is an upstream package (NOT ROS) that is required to build one of the ROS packages; I think flann, assimp or opencv, if I'm remembering correctly.
There is no binary build of libtbb-dev for Ubuntu Precise armhf, and when I was doing Groovy builds, it didn't build on armhf.
Newer versions of Ubuntu (Raring) have a newer version of libtbb-dev which builds and is in the upstream repository; you may want to try using a newer version of Ubuntu, or downloading the sources for the newer libtbb-dev from Raring and trying to build and install it on Precise.

Thank you for this follow-up. Among packages that I do need are opencv, cv-bridge, image-transport, sensor-msgs, rosbag and arm-kinematics. Are they (or will those be) available on Raring armhf ? I prefer installing from repository since building on 1 GHz/500MB is not a task I look forward to.

About installing Raring: there are 2 images I can find: desktop-omap4 and server-omap. For which one is the armhf Raring repository intended? I have an omap(3) board.
Could you please follow-up ?
