Hi,
Is there a way to get the coordinates of a point (x and y coordinates) using the mouse on the gazebo client?
Best,

A:

Yes, you can get it with a GUI plugin.
Here's an example which gets the mouse position on mouse move.
It uses gui::MouseEventHandler::AddMoveFilter and gives it a callback which is called whenever the mouse is moved on the 3D scene.
Then it uses Scene::FirstContact to get the coordinates of that point in 3D.

Could you be more specific with the instructions ? I am newbie in Gazebo and didn't understand what I should do in order to display the coordinates
