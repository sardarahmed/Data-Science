Q:

Error with Motoman SDA10F package

Hello,
When I try the instruction roslaunch motoman_sda10f_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true, the next errors appear

So, I can't plan trajectories.
How can I solve it?
Thank you

I've cross-posted this to the ROS-I mailing list. In the meantime: can you tell us how you installed the package, and on what OS and ROS version?
Comment by jcgarciaca on 2015-12-01:
Thanks for your answer. I installed the package from source according with this link motoman_indigo, on Ubuntu 10.04.1 (trusty) with ROS Indigo.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-12-01:
Ok. Please report this issue at the issue tracker at the motoman repository. You can just refer to your question on ROS answers here.

A:

The simulation mode for the motoman package doesn't support dual arm configuration at this time.  If you simply want to plan in MoveIt, you can do this using roslaunch motoman_sda10f_moveit_config demo.launch.

Thanks for your answer.
I had tried the instruction that you suggested, but it shows the errors about the robot isn't a chain. Additionally, in MoveIt I can plan just for the left robot.
And, isn't it possible to connect with the real robot?
Thank you

Something must have changed in the underlying MoveIt library (or maybe it never worked).  I will verify this tonight.  Connecting to the real robot is possible assuming the latest driver code (indigo) is loaded.  Connecting to a simulated robot is not supported.
Comment by sedwards on 2015-12-01:
I have verified the issue.  The MoveIt configuration appears correct.  I'm working to track to the cause of the issue.  Thanks for reporting this.
Comment by jcgarciaca on 2015-12-01:
Thanks for your help.
I installed the driver one year ago, so I suppose it isn't the latest available. Could you tell me how to update it? and please let me know if you find out how to fix this problem, I am working with a robot like it. How could I try to track the cause?
Comment by sedwards on 2015-12-01:
It turns out to not be an issue.  The other planning groups can be selected under Motion Planning->Planning Request->Planning Group.  Only the arms have a valid IK solver.  Interactive markers won't appear for other groups.  Planning can be done on other groups using "random" positions.

Thank you so much for your help. The planning in MoveIt works well, I'll try to connect with the real robot then I tell you. Thanks again.
