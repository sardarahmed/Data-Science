Q:

roscore bug Errno8

I've got a new installation of ROS Indigo on OSX Yosemite.
In a terminal when I enter: roscore   I get the error message:

...
76, in is_local_address
local_addresses = ['localhost'] + get_local_addresses()   File
"/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rosgraph/network.py",
line 240, in get_local_addresses
local_addrs = [host[4][0] for host in
socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(),
0, socket.AF_INET, 0, socket.SOL_TCP)]
gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known

printenv | grep ROS    prints out:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=indigo
ROS_IP=0.0.0.0
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros

I have no /etc/hosts file.
ping localhost     works.
I'm just trying to run ROS master and clients locally on my Mac.
Thanks!

A:

Your ROS_IP is 0.0.0.0, but I'm pretty sure that's not valid. Also you shouldn't have to set your ROS_HOSTNAME to anything by default. But neither of those cause the same problem on my mac.
