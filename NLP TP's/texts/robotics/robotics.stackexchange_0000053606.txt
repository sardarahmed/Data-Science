Q:

How can I represent Multidimensional array in msg format

If i have something like
int  mein[NUM][4]; 

in C++. How do I represent it in msg format.
Should it be something like
uint8[][4] mein

Also as NUM is defined in my C++ file and can vary according to certain parameters. Should I just allocate it dynamically in msg format or I should give it a certain value or define NUM in msg format. Do you think there would be any disadvantage if I just allocate it dynamically meaning like uint8[][4] mein.

A:

Hi michael,
you can probably use the std_msgs/ByteMultiArray. You can define a MultiArrayLayout which considers the NUM size. Examples are given in the linked documentations.
I am not really used to C++, so I can't really help you with the allocation question.
