Q:

openni_launch rosdep on OS X

rosdep seems to know about openni_launch, but the formula ros/hydro/rgbd_launch is not there. Is the formula supposed to be there, or is rosdep wrong?
I'm on OS X 10.9 Mavericks with a desktop-full install of ROS hydro.
$ rosdep install --from-paths src/openni_launch --ignore-src
Error: No available formula for rgbd_launch
Please tap it and then try again: brew tap ros/hydro
executing command [brew install ros/hydro/rgbd_launch]
Error: No available formula for rgbd_launch
Please tap it and then try again: brew tap ros/hydro
Searching taps...
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  homebrew: command [brew install ros/hydro/rgbd_launch] failed

A:

The problem is likely that rgbd_launch is missing from your workspace. To understand why it failed like this, you have to understand the process through with rosdep goes when resolving dependencies:

Is rgbd_launch a package on the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
If yes, consider it resolved
Is rgbd_launch a system dependency (defined in the rosdep rules at https://github.com/ros/rosdistro)?
If yes, try to install it
Otherwise it must be a ROS package which is not in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Try to install that ROS package from the system's package manager.

On OS X, it tries to guess at the formula name, in this case ros/hydro/rgbd_launch, which fails because it doesn't have a homebrew formula. On Ubuntu, this would have done sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rgbd-launch and it would have succeeded.
The solution to your problem is to add rgbd_launch to your workspace. I would recommend making a rosinstall file using the rosinstall_generator:
sudo pip install rosinstall-generator
source /path/to/hydro/install/setup.bash
rosinstall_generator openni_launch --rosdistro hydro --deps --exclude RPP > openni_launch.rosinstall

The resulting rosinstall file will include openni_launch, and any of its dependencies which are not in your RPP.
You can then get all of the repositories in this rosinstall file by using wstool:
wstool init src openni_launch.rosinstall

Thanks for this excellent answer. I wasn't aware of this last step of guessing the furmula name. I only just recently switched to catkin.
