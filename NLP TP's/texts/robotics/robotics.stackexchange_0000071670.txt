Q:

cannot launch node of type [hector_quadrotor_teleop/quadrotor_teleop]: can't locate node [quadrotor_teleop] in package [hector_quadrotor_teleop]

Anyone could help me out with this error??
I've followed these instructions to install the hector quadrotor packages:
mkdir ~/hector_quadrotor_tutorial
cd ~/hector_quadrotor_tutorial
wstool init src https://raw.github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor/hydro-devel/tutorials.rosinstall
roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo indoor_slam_gazebo.launch
roslaunch hector_quadrotor_teleop xbox_controller.launch

But then I get the following error:
> pablo@pablo-MacBookPro:~$ roslaunch
> hector_quadrotor_teleop
> xbox_controller.launch  ... logging to

Thanks in advance!
p.s.: the problem is not that I haven't overlaid the correct environment (I added the "source deve/setup.bash" to my bashrc)

Have you remembered to actually build your workspace?
