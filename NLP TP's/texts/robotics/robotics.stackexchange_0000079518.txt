Q:

How to install husky-simulator in kinetic?

Dear community,
I'm new with ros. After having installed ROS kinetic in a blank Ubuntu 16.04 VM (everything very smooth, unbelievable quality of the ROS wiki), I want to try husky-simulator tutorial, as proposed in http://wiki.ros.org/husky_gazebo/Tutorials/Simulating%20Husky
First step in tutorial is

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-husky-simulator

I get error

E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-husky-simulator

I understand the package has been created for ROS "indigo" release and since I'm using kinetic it won't work.
Would there be a way to get it working?
Alternatively I may need to replace "kinetic" by "indigo" but I feel it does not scale.
Thank you in advance,
Daniel.

Thanks for your answer!
After installing the packages, the  rosdep instruction gives me the following error:
ERROR: Rosdep experienced an error: Multiple packages found with the same name "husky_gazebo" and has the packages that are the same in the folders.
Does that mean that I can keep only one?
