Q:

How to build OpenCV package?

I have just started using ROS and completed some basic tutorials in the Wiki.
I have created a workspace and tried building some packages. So far so good.
It has been a while since i did anything technical, and have used OpenCV in the past , i thought it could be a good way to start learning ROS .
Can anyone point me to a tutorial on how to use the OpenCV package in ROS ? How do i build it and use it from inside the sandbox workspace ? Should i pull it from the repo and use rosmake or build it at the original installation path?

A:

OpenCV is a system dependency as of electric, so you'll have to install it separately rather than using rosmake. You can find installation instructions on the openCV website.
To use openCV with ROS, you'll want to use the cv_bridge package of the vision_opencv stack.  It basically converts openCV data structures into ROS messages. You can find tutorials for using cv_bridge here.
