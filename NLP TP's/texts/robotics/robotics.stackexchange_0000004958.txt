Q:

How to program an Inovatic USB interface?

In my possession I have an Inovatic USB Interface. (In Detail: UI-8x8 v1.1 2009) I would like to program it to do some simple stuff and things. I am familiar with C# Programming but from what i have heard its not possible to program this interface with C#.
What it looks like:

Where can I find the Drivers for this Interface?  I have checked the Inovatic website but they only have the v1.0 version of the drivers and I'm pretty sure that I need v1.1 !
How can i program it? What language do i use?

A:

Drivers
The only link they have to download drivers is on their download page. Unfortunately the link to the EMoRo USB drivers returns a 404 error. I have attempted to send a message to the company to let them know.
As for the version of the driver, the only way you'll know if the v1.0 driver will work is if you try it. Since nothing else is available at the moment, you should try working with the driver you have and see if you have any problems relating to that.
Programming Tools
According to the page you linked in your question:

The kit is designed for users who wish to program the robot with a flowchart or in the Basic programming language... Advanced users can program the robot in Bascom-AVR or AVR C and they can build their own autonomous robot. 

So you can either use their flow-chart programming environment, you can use Bascom-AVR (which is BASIC for AVR microcontrollers), or you can program it in C. It looks like Inovatic's download page has IDEs and compilers available to download for free to use any of these options.
