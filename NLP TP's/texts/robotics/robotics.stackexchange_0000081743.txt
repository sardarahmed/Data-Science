Q:

Know if a model exists in my Gazebo Simulation

Hi all,
I would like to know how to check if a model exists in my simulation. I wrote a C++ node who change position of a model (with set_model_state) but I would like to verify in this node if the model really exists. Does someone have an idea ? Thanks :)
