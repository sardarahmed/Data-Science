Q:

UDOO board- SD Card Partition

Hi there,
I have a UDOO Quad board loaded with Ubuntu 12.04. Before loading ubuntu I did not partition the SD card (8GB). Now if I want to Install Hydro ROS, will I be able to partition it without erasing ubuntu from the SD Card?
Or can I put in ROS without partitioning?

Acctually  ROS just like the software not really OS, if you install it , it will be stored in ubuntu file system, you dont need divide partition

You should be able to expand the root file system, if that is what you are asking.
