Q:

Passing arguments via rqt_launch plugin (ROS Launch GUI)

Hi all,
I'm trying to pass an argument to my node via the rqt pluging rqt_launch.
But, whatever I type in the GUI into the field "arguments", the values are not passed to my node. Always the default value is passed.
Here the code of my launch-file:
<launch>
<arg name="foo" default="string"/>
<node name="some_other_node" pkg="some_other_pkg" type="some_other_type" />
<node name="node_with_arg" pkg="the_pkg" type="the_type" args="$(arg foo)"/>
</launch>

If I start it via command line and roslaunch, everthing is fine, e.g.:
roslaunch name.launch foo:=my_string

But the same syntax with foo:=my_string is not working in the ROS Launch GUI in the arguments field.
What is the correct syntax to set an argument via rqt_launch plugin?

A:

Passing argument is not yet implemented unfortunately, and currently I don't have an extra gear to add that feature. If you or anyone could send a patch toward its devel repository https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues I'm happy to review it.
