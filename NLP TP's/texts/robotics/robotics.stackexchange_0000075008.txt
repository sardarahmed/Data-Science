Q:

cmake_check_build_system' failed

I put in "make"
CMake Error: The source directory "/home/avian/catkin_ws/src" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI.
Makefile:500: recipe for target 'cmake_check_build_system' failed
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1

Then if I put in "catkin_make" and I get this
catkin_make
Base path: /home/avian/catkin_ws/build
The specified source space "/home/avian/catkin_ws/build/src" does not exist

I did edit my CMakeList.txt to
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3) project(beginner_tutorials)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs message_generation )

add_message_files( FILES Num.msg )

add_service_files( FILES AddTwoInts.srv )

generate_messages( DEPENDENCIES std_msgs )

catkin_package( ... CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ... ...)

include_directories( ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(talker beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)

add_executable(listener src/listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(listener ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(listener beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)

I dont know what to do to fix this.

Are you trying to follow any specific tutorial? If so, can you please share its link?
Why do you require the make command? The catkin_make takes care of it. See this link

A:

Based on the output you get from running catkin_make, it looks like you're running it from inside the catkin workspace's build directory.
catkin_make needs to be run from the catkin workspace root directory, as noted in the guide @skr_robo linked to (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/commands/catkin_make):
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make

The first line will take your terminal environment to the catkin workspace's root directory. From there, catkin_make can do it's thing!
