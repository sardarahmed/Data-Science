Q:

How to move packages from build to devel folder

I cannot figure out why some of my packages end up inside the devel folder other stay inside the build folder (including their targets)
Doc just says:

The location of the devel space is controlled by a catkin specific CMake variable called CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX, and it defaults to <build space>/develspace.

How to Configure the package.xml or CMakeLists.txt properly? Link for more info on the files

##EDIT addon
##1.
I changed the order  and It works.
I thought this is the purpose of that command:
## Libraries are installed in a lib/ directory shared by all packages in entire ROS distro
 install(TARGETS my_test_lib
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
    RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_GLOBAL_BIN_DESTINATION})

## List all your executables as TARGETS to be installed in a per-package directory 
#   not the distro’s global bin/ directory
  install(TARGETS talker listener add_two_ints_server add_two_ints_client
    RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})

##2.
Furthermore the  tutorial uses find_package with genmsg but does not mention any build_depend in the xml? Is there a difference to message_generation?  I get this if I use message_generation and not genmsg:
/home/baum/catkin_ws/src/test_my_env/src/add_two_ints_server.cpp:2:36: fatal error: test_my_env/AddTwoInts.h: No such file or directory

#include "test_my_env/AddTwoInts.h"
I feel like all  find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS  need to be mentioned in the run_depend tag in xml 
##3.
Do I need rospy also I only use roscpp. In the tutorials its often present also its c++ tut. (like addtwoints serv/client)
##4.  SOLVED: Argl... I missed the header name AddTwoInts in the variable declaration test_my_env::AddTwoInts::Request 
I moved the package to another workspace and now it says:
 [ 36%] Building CXX object test_my_env/CMakeFiles/my_test_lib.dir/src/add_two_ints_server.cpp.o
 [ 40%] Built target polled_camera_generate_messages_eus

  bool add(test_my_env::Request  &req,
                 ^

                     ^

A:

The CMake call to catkin_package(...) sets the destination folder for binaries, so you need to make sure that your CMakeLists.txt is ordered so that all of your add_executable() and add_library() calls are AFTER your call to catkin_package()

Just to add to this: order matters in CMakeLists.txt with catkin. See wiki/catkin/CMakeLists.txt.
