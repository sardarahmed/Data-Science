Q:

How to fix turtlebot3_bringup is not a launch file name?

I'm trying to run

but it doesn't seem to work. The error I get is:
[turtlebot3_bringup] is not a launch file name   

The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
Please help, Thank you!!

Can you please update your question with the entire command that you're running?

A:

You haven't specified which launch file you're trying to launch, but I looked the GitHub repo and there doesn't appear to be a turtlebot3_bringup launch file. So, if you're trying to use the turtlebot3_robot.launch launch file use the following command
roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch

The pattern for using launch files is
roslaunch <package-name> <launch-file>

and then you can use some args. See the roslaunch wiki for more information.
