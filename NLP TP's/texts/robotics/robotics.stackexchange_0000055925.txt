Q:

Fuerte: Install bullet from source

I'm currently setting up with Fuerte and need to install bullet so I can use the geometry package. However, I need to install from source and the repository given on the ROS.org bullet page seems to have been removed. Is there somewhere I can get the fuerte version of bullet still?
