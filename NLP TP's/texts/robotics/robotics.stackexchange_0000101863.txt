Q:

Gazebo does not spawn mesh

I was trying to spawn a simple differential drive robot with a mesh for the body, the wheels and the caster ball. The meshes are stores in a folder inside the package called meshes. The name of the package is toycar, so in order to include the meshes, I add the following lines to the definition of the wheel link;
<visual>
        <origin xyz="0.0 0.0 0.0" rpy="1.57 0.0 0.0"/>
        <geometry>
            <mesh filename="package://toycar/meshes/wheel.stl" scale="1.0 1.0 1.0" />
        </geometry>
</visual>

Even if there is no error appearing in the launch of the node, the mesh of the wheel does not appear. This is extended to the other links, but I only worked with this one for now to isolate the problem.

A:

package:// no longer works. Could you try ${find toycar}/meshes/wheel.stl. I believe that should work.

Thanks, it is working now! In which part of the documentation is this found? In order to be able to check more things in the future

This is a very important point - I've had the same mesh problems before and this was the only way to overcome them. It should be mentioned somewhere in the ROS or Gazebo tutorials.

I honestly don't know where in the documentation that's mentioned (if mentioned anywhere). It's one of those things that you pick up over the years I guess?
Could you accept my answer as correct, to mark the question as answered?
Comment by pablo.arandarod on 2022-05-31:
Sure! I thought I did already. But what is weird is that I just checked the ros tutorials and the gazebo tutorials and cannot find anywhere where they mention that.

Could you link to the tutorials where they mention meshes? I've had a quick search and wasn't able to even find a tutorial on meshes.

Here: http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/link
They mention the format I initially put.
Comment by Joe28965 on 2022-05-31:
Ah, yes, wiki.ros consists of ROS1 tutorials, which makes sense since package:// does work in ROS1. docs.ros.org will send you to the ROS2 documentation.

As you can see in this link, it is still unchanged in the tutorials. I might try to find it in the git repository and do some pull request.

@pablo.arandarod It would be this repository and file: https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation/blob/humble/source/Tutorials/URDF/Building-a-Visual-Robot-Model-with-URDF-from-Scratch.rst

@ljaniec, just changed it, it was my first pull request

@pablo.arandarod Cool, I hope it won't be the last :)
