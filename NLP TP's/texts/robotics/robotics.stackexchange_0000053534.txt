Q:

Confusion when installing a supported ROS robot

Hi guys, I have finished with the basic tutorials and want to start work on an AR. Drone. From the ROS page, it has directed me to follow this tutorial:
link:text
My initial confusion is at the beginning where it says

Please make sure that this folder is in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environmental variable.

yet the first line of code says:
cd ~/ros/stacks

My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH does not have a stacks (/opt/ros/fuerte has a stacks folder however). Should I be installing this code in the /opt... path or should I make a new folder in my sandbox directory which is what I did for my beginner tutorials?
Thanks!

A:

Put your code in your sandbox folder, which in this example was named ~/ros/stacks.
Never put any user code in /opt/...
