Q:

Connection between Mongodb and UR5 Nodes?

Hi All,
Recently I have been working with the Universal Robot Stack, When I tried to test the demo.launch file present ur5_moveit_config package, Everything works fine but then I tried to check the Inter-connectivity between different nodes by typing.
$ rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

This Command opens the rqt window and displays the Inter-connectivity between all the Nodes. However the mongodb_wrapper Node does not seem to be connected to any of the Nodes. I would like to understand, as to how one can utilize this database?  Any one who has worked on this with other Robots are also requested to share the details. As I understand, This db is used to store Planning information! Please Correct me if I am Wrong.
Thanks and Regards,
Murali

A:

Maybe the mongodb_wrapper is used through service calls and not topics. (Which would make sense in my opinion...)
These will not be visible in rqt_graph.

Thank you for Replying @Ben_S, would it be possible to access mongodb like other databases? I am wanting to understand the relationship between 'Planning' a Pose and How it is 'Stored and Retrieved'?.
