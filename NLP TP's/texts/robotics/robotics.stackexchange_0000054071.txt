A:

I think it does have a default file because when launching the ASUS is says 'Using default parameters' like  below:
[ WARN] [1380795928.289543389]: Camera calibration file /home/ap/.ros/camera_info/rgb.yaml not found.
[ WARN] [1380795928.289730843]: Using default parameters for RGB camera calibration.
[ WARN] [1380795928.289935967]: Camera calibration file /home/ap/.ros/camera_info/depth.yaml not found.
[ WARN] [1380795928.290074043]: Using default parameters for IR camera calibration.
