Q:

gscam - "illegal operation"

I'm trying to get a camera working on a "roboard" (i386) which is running Ubuntu 10.04 with a full ROS diamondback install.
gscam is falling down at the following line (in http://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/gscam/src/gscam.cpp ), and only returning illegal operation.
image_transport::CameraPublisher pub = it.advertiseCamera("gscam/image_raw", 1);

This setup works on a laptop running the same code, has anyone else had this problem or know a solution?

Did you compile all of ROS or did you install from .debs?

We're going to need more details to debug this; corefiles, version numbers, etc. Also, does it work in (recently-released!) electric?

A:

Even if it is i386, you can get an illegal operation if some extensions are not supported.
Things like SSE might be standard on most current machines and thus are compiled in by default. On a raw i386 you would get that error. The solution would be to recompile without the flags.
