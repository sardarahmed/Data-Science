Q:

UR5 - Gazebo Joint Position controller

Dear all,
I need to simulate a velocity control of a UR5 robot in Gazebo + ROS. But current packages of UR only has a joint trajectory controller, But I want to control individual joint velocities over time.
How can I do this using existing controller ?
or If I create joint position controllers how can I find pid gains that will do the simulation correctly ?
Are any other robot manipulator model with tuned position controllers for Gazebo simulation ?
Your help is really appreciated.
Thanks.

The modern drivers implement a velocity controller: https://github.com/ThomasTimm/ur_modern_driver
