Q:

ROS with Qt creator. New packages do not show up

I am fairly new to ROS. I started using QtCreator as my IDE for ROS development. I followed the instructions from http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#QtCreator.
My problem is that whenever I add a new package using catkin_create_pkg the newly added package do not show up in QtCreator. I also tried reloading CMakeList.txt file from QtCreator (the one at workspace level).
What am I doing wrongly.

A:

I don't know why it doesn't refresh the Project on a build, but if you reconfigure the project, it should show up. Go to "Projects" in the sidebar then to the "Build & Run" tab and hit the "Run CMake..." button under CMake next to Reconfigure project.
