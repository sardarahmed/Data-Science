Q:

Rviz Interactive marker does not move towards y-axis

Hi all,
recently I am playing around with my custom 5-dof robot. In Rviz MotionPlanning panel, I can add <random valid> Goal State to my Query and the corresponding motion can be planned and executed.
However, when I manually try to move the robot with the interactive marker, the marker simply does not move towards y-axis. I thought the marker is not moving because I commanded the robot to move to an unreachable position, however since the Query panel succeeded to bring the robot to that position, I am clueless.
What could be other reasons for this problem?

A:

The interactive marker, as used by the MoveIt RViz plugin, is a 6 DoF marker.
It's inherently impossible for a 5 DoF robot to reach all the poses a 6 DoF marker can assume.
That's the immediate cause of the behaviour you observe.

I thought the marker is not moving because I commanded the robot to move to an unreachable position,

Indeed.
But note: you're not commanding anything yet. The marker only alters the Goal State.

however since the Query panel succeeded to bring the robot to that position, I am clueless.

Using the <random valid> option from the dropdown instructs the MoveIt RViz plugin to chose a random joint space pose for the selected group.
As joint space poses will always be reachable -- no matter the nr of DoF -- this will work.
No IK is involved there, which would explain why you cannnot use the marker, but can set a random joint space pose successfully.
