Q:

Where to ask NXP LPC1343 / ARM Cortex M3 related questions

I am a beginner to robotics and embedded systems. Consequently I have a lot of questions related to the toolchain and how things are going together like how to debug or how to connect a bluetooth module.
I already tried https://electronics.stackexchange.com/ and it did not work out for me.
Any ideas where I can get help with my LPC1343 related questions?

A:

I feel that people who say "this is off-topic" should tell you about some other place where that is on-topic.

I see that you and I are not the only people who think the electronics stackexchange is a good place to ask questions about the NXP LPC1343 and other ARM Cortex M3 processors.
The Arduino Due uses a ARM Cortex-M3 CPU -- perhaps the Arduino Forum or the Arduino Stackexchange or the Arduino Playground might be a good place to ask about setting up a toolchain and debugger for the M3 and other things that are not hyper-specific to the LPC1343.
the GCC ARM Improvement Project might be a good place to ask about setting up a toolchain and debugger that is not specificic to the M3.
The lpc13xx Microprocessor Forum may be a good place to ask about things that are specific to the LPC13xx series (including the LPC1343).
The LPCXpresso now uses the LPC1347 chip -- perhaps you might pick up some good tips at the LPCXpresso Forum
Perhaps you might pick up some good tips in the "Getting started with the LPC-P1343" document.
I hear the Dangerous Prototypes forum sometimes discusses the LPC1343.

Good luck.
