A:

here and Here are the description how to install the driver and its ros-wrapper and how to run them. Then listen to one of the .../points topics as described in 10. or 11. here.
The driver publishes:
* /camera/depth/camera_info : Camera parameters for the IR (depth) camera
* /camera/depth/image : single channel floating point (float32) depth image, containing the depth in meters.
* /camera/depth/points : point cloud without color information
* /camera/rgb/camera_info : Camera parameters for the RGB camera
* /camera/rgb/image_color : RGB image
* /camera/rgb/image_mono : Grayscale image
* /camera/rgb/points : point cloud containing RGB value for each point

Yes all. You could omit those with service/client, but it won't do no harm. Also you can omit either python or c++. If you want to process the point clouds, I'd use c++, though. What kind of 3d model do you want to convert to?

what would be a good choice to convert the point cloud into the 3d model? Will using Meshlab be a good choice?

I think you should go through the tutorials i linked to, to get a foundation of how ROS works
