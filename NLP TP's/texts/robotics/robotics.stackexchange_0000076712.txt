Q:

ros: kinetic: web_video_server

Hi my maintainers,
is there a reason why web_video_server is not available at ros-kinetic default distribution ?
I like this nice tool for my robots frontview cam.
Cheers
Christian

Looks like it will be released for Kinetic soon. You may be able to help test it. https://github.com/RobotWebTools/web_video_server/issues/29
