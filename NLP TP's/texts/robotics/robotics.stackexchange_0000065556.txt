Q:

robot-upstart indigo

Hi,
I'm trying to use upstart to run my robot application at the startup of the system but I can't configure it.
I currently have my catkin workspace with my tool at /home/robot/workspace and when I run the command:
$rosrun robot_upstart install workspace/src/safe_pilot/launcher/safe_pilot.launch
I have the error:
Unable to located path src/safe_pilot/launcher/safe_pilot.launch in package workspace. Installation aborted.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/robot_upstart/install", line 32, in 
exit(main())
File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/robot_upstart/install_script.py", line 83, in main
if os.path.isfile(found_path[0]):
IndexError: list index out of range
Does someone has an idea??
tks

A:

The argument to robot_upstart install is  pkg/path.
In your case:
$rosrun robot_upstart install safe_pilot/launcher/safe_pilot.launch

tks for your answer,
Does it suppose that my package has been installed using catkin_make install ? or can I used the catkin_workspace/devel folder?
Comment by BennyRe on 2015-02-03:
No you don't have to do catkin_make install. You also don't have to care about the devel folder. This command should work as it is.

Ok tks it works.
Just a last question: How to remove/suspend the automatic launch... (removing manually the created files??)

robot_upstart includes an uninstall script.
Comment by julien on 2015-03-03:
Are you shure ? because in the GIT repository I can't see an uninstall script and the documentation don't speak about it...
I have an other question one of my node is in charge to log data in a file and when I use robot_upstart the file can't be created, does the program is run with a Read-Only opt

Oh I see. There was an uninstall script till Mike Purvis ported the install script to python.

The uninstall script has been restores as of v0.1.2 (not synced to public yet), so either install from the shadow repositories or do a source-install
