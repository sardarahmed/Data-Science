Q:

installing on new ubuntu 10.10 problems - diamondback has a zillion unmet dependencies

I add the repositories and stuff with no problems, and when I try this:
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full
I get a bunch of error messages like the below sample:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-diamondback-desktop-full : Depends: ros-diamondback-ros-tutorials (= 0.2.4-s1299044686~maverick) but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-diamondback-geometry-tutorials (= 0.1.3-s1299044839~maverick) but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-diamondback-slam-gmapping (= 1.2.2-s1299034975~maverick) but it is not going to be installed
[many more ]
And to answer my own question, it turns out I had some mysql stuff already installed that conflicted, and after I removed those packages, the full thing installed (well, is installing) okay
