Q:

github access to ros_comm broken?

I am trying to chase down a problem running rostest on a dry stack under Groovy. But, when I go to https://github.com/ros/ros_comm, it says:
Sorry,
this tree took too long to generate.

Is it just me, or is there a serious github scaling problem?

Looks like it's just the groovy-devel branch. Maybe there's a symlink cycle? I'm not sure how git handles that.

You're right about other branches working, Dan. But, I don't see any recent commits that look like symlink changes.

I can confirm this. If you just need a look at the current source code: I could still fork ros_comm and in my fork groovy_devel shows just fine.

I wonder if ros_comm recently exceeded some github display limitation?

A:

We contacted GitHub and they did something that "fixed" it.
