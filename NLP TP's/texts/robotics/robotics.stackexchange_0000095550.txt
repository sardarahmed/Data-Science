Q:

ros.org REPs not accessible Error 403 Forbidden

Hi together,
I tried to read something out of the reps but I can't access them. I tried on 3 different devices.
Not sure who to contact relating this issue, does someone know?

I'd say, the right way would be to post an issue on the respective repo on GitHub.
As a matter of fact, there is one already :-)
