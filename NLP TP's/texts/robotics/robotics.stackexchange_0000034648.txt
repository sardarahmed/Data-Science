Q:

Problem loading cram_language in SLIME

Hi.
I have a problem. I set up cram_emacs_repl (because I'm a bit lazy :P). SLIME loads well but when I run the command (ros-load:load-system "cram_language" :cram_language) to use the package CPL, it says:
Component "cram_language" not found
I don't understand the problem. I have the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH configured correctly and ROS finds cram_language package with the command 'rospack find' but in SLIME doesn't.
Thanks!

Ok. However, I followed the steps at here and when I do rosmake in roslisp_repl gives:
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['roslisp_repl']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory
[ rosmake ] /home/biyonder/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20111006-075129
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['roslisp_repl'] to:
[]
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['roslisp_repl']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
It seems there doesn't find roslisp_repl as package or stack. The path ~/cram-ros is correctly set in $PATH.
Thanks.

Did you try 'source ~/cram-ros/setup.bash' and then a 'roscd roslisp_repl'? If that works, 'rosmake roslisp_repl' should also work.
