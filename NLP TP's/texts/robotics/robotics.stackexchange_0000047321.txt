Q:

Load a map in map_server

And how can I load a map into the map server?
I'm calling:
<node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find p2os_nav)/simple_office_map.svg 0.1f"/> 

in the launch file but I get this error:
[map_server-1] process has died [pid 12465, exit code 255].
log files: /home/camilla/.ros/log/8b409eb6-5feb-11e2-b202-000fb0a0b12e/map_server-1*.log

and nothing is published on the /map topic.
Any ideas?
Cheers!

From the docs: Image data is read in via SDL_Image; supported formats vary, depending on what SDL_Image provides on a specific platform.

A:

I don't know if svg is supported. Can you try to convert the image to something like png/pgm? In principle this procedure works for me.
