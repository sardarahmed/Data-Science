Q:

Problems while starting out with ROS - robotino_node launch issues

Hello,
While trying out this tutorial http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/wiki/index.php/Robotino_slam, I am not able to run the code roslaunch robotino_node robotino_node.launch hostname:=<insert your robotino's ip address here>, which gives me an error:
[robotino_node.launch] is neither a launch file in package [robotino_node] nor is [robotino_node] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
Anyone can help me here?
