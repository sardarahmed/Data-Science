Q:

Run multiple servo on ROS with arduino

Hello everybody,
i wanted to know is there any way out by which i can 2 or more servos at a time from a single subscriber. Currently i am running one servo on a single channel of arduino Due. But i require two servos to be run at a same time by giving them different angle values. like;
rostopic pub Servo1 std_msgs/Int16 230; 

this passes 230 degree to the servo attached. But i want to control two at a time like;
rostopic pub Servo1 std_msgs/Int16 230 130 240;

230 for 1st servo; (degrees) 130 for 2nd servo; (degrees) 240 for 3rd servo...(degrees)
I would appreciate if someone puts a light on this issue.
thnks

A:

You've got two options. Most straightforward would be a basic custom message with an array. This answer may help. Second option which is more elegant and involves less code is a MultiArray.
