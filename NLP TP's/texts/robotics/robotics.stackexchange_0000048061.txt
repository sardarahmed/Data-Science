Q:

trouble creating sandbox in groovy

Trying to install groovy on a 64 bit HP G62 running Ubuntu 12.04. Followed installation instructions up to 4.2 Creating a sandbox directory for new packages.
Under 4.1 Creating a new workspace, I changed out
rosws init ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte
to
rosws init ~/groovy_workspace /opt/ros/groovy
$echo ROS_PACKAGE_PATH returned /opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
I checked in the home folder and groovy_workspace was indeed created. Sandbox folder was created in the groovy_workspace folder. Thinking it odd that my package path didn't match, I continued on to the the tutorials to see what would happen.
Had no problems until I got to the point where it tells you to run roscd by itself.
this is what I got:
No ROS_WORKSPACE set.  Please set ROS_WORKSPACE to use roscd with no arguments.
tried the whole procedure again but as written in the wiki, not substituting groovy for fuerte, same result. (fuerte_workspace created, sandbox inside, but all else exactly the same). Not sure what I'm doing wrong, would appreciate some guidance.
regards, Richard

A:

Looks like a bug. I tried to replicate the problem and can confirm the same behaviour.
Seems the issue is somewhere in setup.sh and/or in the files it implicitly sources. It unsets the ROS_WORKSPACE variable exported at the beginning. Even if you specify ROS_WORKSPACE by hand it will be deleted after sourcing the setup.bash.
To make roscd work without arguments I can suggest you to set ROS_WORKSPACE explicitly in your .bashrc after the line that sources the relevant setup file.
EDIT: opened a ticket.
