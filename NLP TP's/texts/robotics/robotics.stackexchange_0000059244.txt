Q:

How to achieve a value of a multi-type message mesage?

Dear friends,
I am trying to Subscribe from a topic, this topic has been published by CMVISION (/blobs) and has this type :
Header header
uint32 image_width
uint32 image_height
uint32 blob_count
Blob[] blobs
and in this type, "Blob" is another message type itself :
uint32 red
uint32 green
uint32 blue
uint32 area
uint32 x
uint32 y
uint32 left
uint32 right
uint32 top
uint32 bottom
I want to subscribe the "x" and "y" from this message, but I dont know hoe to call that,
For example I want to write them on the terminal  and in my "callback" function I wrote :
void callback1(const cmvision::Blobs::ConstPtr& msg1)
{
ROS_INFO("I heard: [%d]", msg1->blobs ??????);   

}
I tried to call that like an array, it didn't work.... can any body help me in this problem?
Thanks
HAmed

A:

blobs should be a std::vector, so
msgl->blobs.at(i)

or
msgl->blobs[i]

should work
