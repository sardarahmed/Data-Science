Q:

How I can use generated headers (like from messages) from one package in another?

I'm using groovy + catkin.
How can I include the devel/include<package_name>, which contains e.g. the generated header-files from the messages in another package?
find_package(package_name REQUIRED)

and
include_directories(include
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${merlin_messages_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

doesn't seem to be enough, I suppose that this include only the headers which come from this package, but not the automatically generated one?

A:

The code you posted is sufficient for finding headers, as message headers are generated to the same location that your others headers go to.
