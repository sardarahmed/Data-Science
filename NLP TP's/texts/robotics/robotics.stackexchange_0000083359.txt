Q:

How can I find ROS packages on GitHub?

How can I find ROS packages on GitHub? I thought about e.g. using the GitHub search field with something like <package> filename:package extension:xml to search for package.xml files which contain <package> (GitHub syntax for searching code). But I did not come up with a suitable serach pattern so far.

A:

I'm not sure how useful it is (ie: I get way too many results), but if I search with ros filetype:xml site:github.com I only get links to package.xml files, which would seem to belong to ROS pkgs.
Note that package.xml files are also used by some other (OSS) projects.

Btw: seeing this - and your other questions: is there some specific context you are asking all these questions from/in? Automated testing (roswtf, fuzzing, etc) + automated discovery of packages seems to start to point in a certain direction ..

Yes, I try to find information about automated testing in ROS. Many lower level testing topics are generic and independent of the company I am working for. As everyone depends on other peoples packages (up to the ROS node level I guess) I am planning to share generic information...

... about how to improve reliability (w.r.t. that the package does what it is meant for from a functional validation and verification point of view) of ROS packages in a GitBook. (wiki.ros.org turned out to be not suitable for me.)

Searching on google for ros filetype:xml site:github.com is quite ok.

And just leaving this here: ROS Index.
