Are you using the ROS-Comm version or the Desktop version? The ROS-Comm version does not contain any GUI tools such as Rviz.

I am using ros common version

A:

As the GUI tools would not be installed in the ROS-Comm version, therefore tools such as Rviz & rqt would not be available. Install the Desktop version instead.

Another way to is to use another ROS installed computer that is connected within the same network, and visualize the topics from there instead of on the RPi itself. You can checkout on how to connect them together here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
