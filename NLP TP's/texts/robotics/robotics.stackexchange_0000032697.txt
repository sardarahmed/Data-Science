Q:

Iterate points for OpenCV's Line function

I'm trying to iterate from two tuples to create a line connection previous points to currents points.
    for (x,y) in currFeatures and (px,py) in self.prev_draw_features:
            cv.line(new_image, (px,py),(x,y),cv.RGB(125, 20,200),5)

Which then leads me to this error:

[ERROR] [WallTime: 1309631642.294530]
bad callback: <bound method
cached_subscriber.callback of
<main.cached_subscriber instance
at 0x2bbb290>> Traceback (most recent
call last):   File
"/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/src/rospy/topics.py",
line 563, in _invoke_callback
cb(msg)   File "****",
line 70, in callback
for (x,y) in currFeatures and (px,py) in self.prev_draw_features:
NameError: global name 'px' is not
defined

Is it possible to iterate between two tuples at the exact same time, or will I need to construct a new variable to iterate between the elements.  Keep in mind that the tuples may not be equal (which probably negates my "and" statement.
Thanks.

A:

What you probably want is:
for ((x,y), (px,py)) in zip(currFeatures, self.prev_draw_features):
        cv.line(new_image, (px,py),(x,y),cv.RGB(125, 20,200),5)

Okay I got it fixed thanks!

I get new image from a live feed camera.

How do you get "new_image"? I think that is the only parameter that has to be a numpy array.
Comment by Kirielson on 2011-07-02:
Okay I did try that but then I got the error:  File "****", line 73, in callback
cv.line(new_image, (px,py),(x,y),cv.RGB(125, 20,200),5)
TypeError:  is not a numpy array   Would I need to first extract all of the information out then re-insert it in?
