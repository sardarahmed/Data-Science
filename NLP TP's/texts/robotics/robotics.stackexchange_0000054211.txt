Q:

problem controlling pan and tilt with gui

Hi,
I am a beginner with ROS and have built an URDF Model for a turtlebot. The turtlebot is equiped with a Pan&Tilt unit consisting of 2 servos, which I can manipulate and display with the provided gui Interface in Rviz.
I also have a launch file to start the servos and manipulate them with the keyboard. But this is not linked to my robot model.
How do I bring this two things together, such that I can control the robot in rviz as well as the corresponding Hardware?
I know this is not much information. Here the RQT Graph after starting all the Nodes.
