Q:

Error on creating LaserScan message using Sonar data

I am trying to create a laserscan using Sonar Sensor but I got an error launching the file.
[serial.launch] is neither a launch file in package [name] nor is [name] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I checked the files if there are some typographical errors or files are in a wrong path but everything is okay.
Do you have any idea on how to fix this?

Have you sourced your environment?
Comment by sonarsensor on 2018-01-02:
Yes, I did the setup.bash

A:

The package should most probably not be called name but rather serial.
From the error output, it seems your command was
roslaunch name serial.launch

The Syntax is
roslaunch <pkg> <Launch file>
