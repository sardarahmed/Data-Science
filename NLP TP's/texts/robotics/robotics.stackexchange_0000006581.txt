Q:

Stereo camera Vs Kinect

Any one can advice me on the ideal perception sensors for pick and place application using a robotic manipulator with ROS support. I have generally looked at things like Kinect and stereo cameras (Bumblebee2) which provide depth that can be used with PCL for object recognition and gripper positioning. Are there any other sensors would be preferred for such application and if not what are the drawbacks of stereo cameras in comparison to Kinect or other sensing capability. 
Thanks,
Alan

A:

The Kinect is certainly a popular choice these days for robotics.  However, time-of-flight, structured light, and stereo cameras all have their own strengths and weaknesses.  These two threads have a good discussion:

What main factors/features explain the high price of most industrial computer vision hardware? 
Question for those who have experience using stereo cameras/module (e.g. ZED, DUO M, Bumblebee, etc.)

I think the simple answer is that stereo requires visual texture in the scene, and you can alter your baseline for different min/max ranges.  TOF cameras might have trouble with certain materials, and can give you false readings when an object is too close to the camera.
