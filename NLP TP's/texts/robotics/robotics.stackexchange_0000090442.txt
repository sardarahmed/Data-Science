A:

Hi, First you might need to convert the image from ros message image to open cv image using  cv_bridge, then use the available functions of Opencv to read color values, like
cv:: Mat image ;
Point3_<uchar>* p =image.ptr< Point3_<uchar> > (y,x);
p->x //B
p->y //R
p->z //G

and probably you can find other methods here

yes, x,y are the pixel coordinates (width and height )
