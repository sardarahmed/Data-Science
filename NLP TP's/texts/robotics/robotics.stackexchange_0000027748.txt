Q:

why do we need the sdf element "collide with contact"?

Why do we need 'collide_without_contact' since this violates the physics laws? Any specific use cases?

A:

It's quite common to disable contact when running tests. This depends on what you're working on...

It is also useful when creating an object that other objects should pass through, but still have collisions reported. This has been used to simulate mud.
