Q:

How to convert with gzsdf in Gazebo 1.2.5?

Hi,
Could I get an example how to convert an sdf 1.0 to sdf 1.2 with the gzsdf tool?
gzsdf convert [sdf_file] when I run it like this:
$./gazebo/bin/gzsdf convert /home/<some_path>/models/spatula.sdf
gives me this ERROR: SDF parsing the xml failed
Thanks,
Andrei

A:

I figured it out, I did not $source setup.bash in the gazebo folder.
