Q:

How to start a ROS node on startup?

I am using an Odroid U3 with my robot, Ubuntu 14.04. I am using an external computer to launch the ROS node of the robot.
I was wondering if there is a way to start ROS in the robot after the Odroid starts up. Like if the robot were turned on with the ROS node running after the startup. That way I would not have to use the external computer. Right now I do not need to monitor the robot so it is OK if I do not have a roscore running externally.

This has been asked many times before, a simple search gives me the following answers:

autostart a launchfile after/while boot
Best practices for launching ROS on startup

Answers to both questions point the OPs to clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart and ros-system-daemon-groovy, which seem like good starting points to get something working.
Major advantage of the 'upstart' approach is that it automatically takes care of waiting for your network (and any other required services) to come up before starting roscore fi. Unless you have very specific reasons (ie: no upstart support), I'd refrain from writing something yourself.

I've started using systemctl instead of upstart. Seems like that's the way the linux community is going. In order to do this I add the file my-service.service to /etc/systemd/system that runs a bash file I've stored under /usr/sbin/my-service. It can be enable and disable using systemctl commands
