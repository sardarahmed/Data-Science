Q:

How to view turtlesim in Windows host machine using putty?

Hello all,
i am very much new to ROS. I am running one virtual machine (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Indigo distro installed) using Vmware Player on my Windows 7 host machine. I have connected my vm using putty (ssh client). I tried to run turtlesim via putty terminal and i got the error of 'X server not found' which i have solved using the link Problem with ROS Networking.. But the output window is coming in the vm. I can control from putty.
My question is, is there any way i can view the output at my windows host machine?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Do you have an X-client installed on your Windows machine? If not, that would be the first thing to do.
