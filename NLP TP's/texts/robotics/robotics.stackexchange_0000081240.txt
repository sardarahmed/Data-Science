Q:

Error with installing ROS indigo on ubuntu 14.04

I'm trying to install Ros indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I'm following the link http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu. However when ever I try to do the line
sudo apt-get update

It gibes me the error
N: Ignoring file 'ros' in directory '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/' as it has no filename extension

I've tried to redo everthing multiple times, and my friend was able to do this without any problems.
What is the solution?
Thanks.

which I feel in this case is pretty clear: you have a file which has just a name - ros - but without any file extension. apt doesn't know what sort of file that is, so it decides to ignore it.
From the wiki page you linked:

Did you perhaps not copy the entire line? That would result in a file named ros to be created, instead of ros-latest.list.
Try adding the extension .list to the file and see whether that improves things. I suspect it will (provided that the file contains what it is supposed to).
