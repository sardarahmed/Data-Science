A:

I see two likely reasons for the issue:

Your rviz fixed frame is set to a non-standard frame. This could result in all sorts of "weird" motion displayed.
Odometry is indeed buggy and has a wrong sign or so.

You'll probably want to have a look at the output of
rostopic echo odom

and look at the raw numbers. You can update your question with this output, too.
