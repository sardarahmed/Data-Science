A:

Does the first part still show up while not running roscore? I had the same problem and if it does, it simply means you have to install python-bloom and python-rosrelease. Simply put these in, then reopen the terminal and run roswtf. Hope this helps!
$ sudo apt-get install python-bloom
$ sudo apt-get install python-rosrelease

not working on melodic, I can only install python bloom, python-rosrelease is not found, and the bad descriptor error reappears anyway (ubuntu 18.04LTS)
