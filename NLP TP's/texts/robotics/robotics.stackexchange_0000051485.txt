Q:

What is /opt/ros/groovy/setup.sh for in the ~/.bashrc

I'm now transferring from Fuerte to Groovy. I found that after setting up the workspace, I don't need the line "source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash" in ~/.bashrc . It seems that only "source $HOME/code/ros_groovy/devel/setup.bash" is needed in ~/.bashrc. I can still create and make package, and run a node successfully without "source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash".
What will happen if I omit this line in the .bashrc?

A:

I imagine you have source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash somewhere in your other bash file.
If you do, then you should not have to source the file in the .bashrc.
If you don't, however, try omitting it/commenting it out (use a '#' in front of the line). If it doesn't work, then replace it.
I don't know what would happen if you sourced it twice. I'm pretty sure it would not break anything. If I were you, I'd try it. If it doesn't work, reverse it.
Make a copy of your current settings:
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.old

Then modify it. If it breaks stuff, then just do:
cp ~/.bashrc.old ~/.bashrc

Do you have the similar experience? What will happen if you omit this line on your computer? For my case, I can do the usual works correctly, but I wonder if there might be some problems.

Like Allen mentioned, there is likely a line in $HOME/code/ros_groovy/devel/setup.bash that sources from /opt/ros/groovy See http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment and http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/workspaces to understand the environment created with workspace
