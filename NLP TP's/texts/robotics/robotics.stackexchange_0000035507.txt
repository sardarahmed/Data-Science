Q:

From structure to message

Hi everybody,
Does someone has ideas about how to directly send a C structure over topics/services/actions ?
Currently I read some data from a file and end up with this data in a structure S, then I copy the data in S into a ROS msg data structure ROS_S (which is identical to S).
This copy-past step bothers me and I would like to know if someone has a simple solution about this.

A:

To avoid the extra step of converting from S to ROS_S on the publisher, you can define custom serialization functions for S.
