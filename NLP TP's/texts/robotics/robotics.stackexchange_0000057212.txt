Q:

rospack export problem / not working on ROS Hydro

Hi Guys! I was using rospack export to get the flags and compile my package outside the rosbuild system. But now, after a long time (ROS fuerte) I'm trying to do the same thing on ROS Hydro and rospack export results in nothing. If I type:
rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags PACKAGE_NAME I got nothing no matter what is the package.
For example: rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags rviz
So, anyone knows if rospack export is no longer working?

A:

rospack export is working fine. E.g. you should get the necessary lflags for packages.
What exact cflags are you expecting?
