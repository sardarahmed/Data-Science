Q:

Converting Collada to URDF

Hi all,
I know that there is a handy urdf-to-collada utility, collada_urdf; however, I am looking to go the other way around. Is there an existing utility to do this?
Best,
mjp

Are you trying to just convert a single object, or multiple objects with joints, etc?

It's a biped humanoid robot (HRP4C)

A:

As far as I know, currently there are no collada->urdf convert software, however robot_model (ROS robot description library) support collada format, thus most of tools can use collada file as well as urdf file. See http://www.ros.org/wiki/collada_urdf/Tutorials/Exporting%20URDF%20to%20COLLADA

Thank you Kei for this information. We have some non-ROS software that can read URDF but not collada, and we were hoping there might be a way to export URDF once the collada format was read in.

Out of curiosity, what non-ROS software reads URDF? Also, are you able to post your COLLADA file?

There is a Matlab based dynamics package we developed in-house at MIT and we recently made it use URDF by default. The collada file - I don't think I can post it because I had to agree to a license to get access to the WRL file. I could point you to the license page, though, if you are interested...
