Q:

rosmake skeleton_markers fails - how to install ready-to-use package?

Hi!
I'd like to use skeleton_markers for displaying skeleton tracked by kinect in RViz on Ros fuerte, Ubuntu 12.04 x86. And I'm having problems.
I downloaded the skeleton_marker from svn, as suggested in ROS tutorial for skeleton-marker and I placed it in my ~/fuerte_wrkspc/sandbox (as suggested in tutorials for beginners). Now, when I try to
rosmake skeleton_markers

it gives an error :
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> skeleton_markers [ make ]

This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
  CMake Error: The source "/home/da-na/fuerte_wrkspc/sandbox/skeleton_markers/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/da-na/fuerte_wrkspc/skeleton_markers/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.

[rosmake-0] Finished <<< skeleton_markers [FAIL] [ 0.13 seconds ]         rosmake skeleton_markers

I'm in the very begining of my adventure with ROS, so maybe I don't see some obvious steps that should be performed. I'll be gratefull for your help!

A:

Try make clean, then compile it again.
