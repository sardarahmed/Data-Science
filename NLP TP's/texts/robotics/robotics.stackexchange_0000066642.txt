Q:

Using 9DOF Sensor Stick EKF

Hi,
I am using a 9DOF Sensor Stick https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10724.
9DOF Razor https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10736 has a dedicated controller to compute orientation whereas I am only getting raw sensor data from 9 DOF Sensor Stick. I am interfacing the 9DOF Sensor stick with an Arduino Mega which also shares its resources interfacing with encoders, motor drive commands and pan-tilt servos. It appears that implementation of DCM or kalman filter on the Arduino is exhausting its resources. Unfortunately, I only have on Arduino. Is it possible use the 9DOF Sensor Stick with raw sensor readings from it? Based on http://answers.ros.org/question/9429/what-imus-work-with-ros/ , I expect the answer is NO. Please correct me, if I am wrong.
Could you please suggest pointers on how to integrate this sensor stick into robot_pose_ekf?
Thanks in advance,
B

A:

You can publish the raw data to ROS and use the AHRS (madgwick's filter) in imu_tools to process the data on the PC side.

Thanks for the reference. I will post once I get the filter working.
Thanks again!
