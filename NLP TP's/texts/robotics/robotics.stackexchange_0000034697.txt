Q:

Gazebo plugin vs. pr2_mechanism

Hello,
I would like to create simulation of simple robot and play with it little. I have (almost) working URDF model a now I have to write some controller. But I'm little bit confused...
First I tried to study how to write Gazebo controller (or plugin?), but documentation is quite poor. Now I'm studying pr2_mechanism stack - it's much better documented and looks like easier way for me.
So my question - what is main difference between robot controller written as Gazebo plugin or as pr2_controller? Which way is encouraged? Is there any important disadvantage when using pr2_controller? Is it possible to use just it without any gazebo plugin?
Thanks for any advice or opinion.

A:

Using the pr2_mechanism model is preferred because it provides a ROS interace to Gazebo. Without this interface, you have no acess to the information from your ROS nodes. The pr2_mechanism stack provides some good tutorials for writing your own controller. A tutorial can be found here.
