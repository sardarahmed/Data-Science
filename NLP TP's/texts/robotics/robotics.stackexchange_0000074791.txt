Q:

how to fuse two GPS into navsat_transform?

Hi, dear:
I wonder to know how to fuse two GPS into navsat_transform if I have two imu(imu0 & imu1), two odometry sources(odom0 & odom1), two gps sources(gps0 & gps1)?
As my understanding:

for EKF_local_node, just fuse imu0 & imu1, odom0 & odom1.
for EKF_global_node, fuse  imu0 & imu1, odom0 & odom1, and also feed the odom2 & odom3(generated by two gps sources gps0 & gps1, output of navsat_transform node ) into it.
launch navsat_transfor_node_0 node, feed into imu0 & gps0 & output of step 2.
launch navsat_transfor_node_1 node, feed into imu1 & gps1 & output of step 2.

Is this right? Please correct me if I'm wrong.
And another question:
a). In step3 and step4, how to verify which imu sources should feed in?
I mean in step3, can I change imu0->imu1 and in step4 change imu1->imu0 or other options? how to determine this? I don't think in navsat_transform node it can support multiple imu imput sources.
b). should I turn on each UTM's broadcast_utm_transform?
c). And any other place should I pay attention to?
Thank you very much for your help!

A:

(a) It's up to you. It doesn't take in multiple IMUs, no, but if you use the use_odometry_yaw setting and you DO NOT have differential or relative mode on for, it will take the fused yaw from the EKF (use ekf_global_node) and use that instead.
(b) That's up to you. Do you need it?
(c) Just keep referring to the tutorials. I also have a branch with some improved documentation in the form of launch and config files.
