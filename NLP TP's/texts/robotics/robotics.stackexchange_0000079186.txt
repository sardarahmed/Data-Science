Q:

How to calculate x,y,z through force_torque sensor values

I need to know how I can perform a function to obtain x, y, z position values through the values Fx,Fy,Fz,Tx,Ty,Tz of the force/torque sensor.

x, y, z of what?

Position values, which can then be combined with the end effector of the robot to position it

A:

What you're talking about is called impedance. Neville Hogan of MIT made it popular although he wasn't the first person to think of the idea. So look up some of his papers.
The basic idea is to convert a force to a velocity or displacement with a spring law, like vel_x=k*F_x. Likewise for torques: omega_x=k*Tao_x. You can adjust the k's to seem more or less stiff.
