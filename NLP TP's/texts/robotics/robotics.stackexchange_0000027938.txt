A:

Floating joints only exist on URDF, not on SDF (which is the primary description format used by Gazebo).
According to URDF documentation, a floating joint "allows motion for all 6 degrees of freedom". For SDF, that would be no joint at all.

Thank you so much for the information sir, kindly let me know, if there is a way to use a ball joint?

Not a "sir" ;) You could take a look at the following tutorial, a ball joint is used for the caster wheel: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=guided_b3 <- link

Hi,
When I click on this link that you have kindly provided, it is not working.
Please kindly let me know, if there is any other resource available.

There is one more question, can we get ball joints by URDF? or xacro? what is the correct syntax for that?

Try the link now ;) That's a lot of questions in one, I suggest you start a new question for that.
