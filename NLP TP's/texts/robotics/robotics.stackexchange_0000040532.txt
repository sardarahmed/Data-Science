Q:

problem running rosjava_tutorial_pubsub

Hello,
I was following the tutorial in rosjava_core, all went smoothly untill I tried to excute the example in rosjava_tutorial_pubsub, in fact, it said in excuting nodes to do
roscore & ./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker & ./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub  org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Listener

First, ./rosjava_tutorial_pubsub dosen't exist in this directory but in build/scripts/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub. Second, when trying
./build/scripts/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker

I got this Error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/ros/RosRun
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.ros.RosRun
at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:217)

at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:266)
Could not find the main class: org.ros.RosRun. Program will exit.
Anyone got this tutorial to work, since gradle ?
Thanks for help,

The same issue here. By the way it seems that only rosjava_tutorial_pubsub is build, not the tutorial_services.

same problem too ...

A:

I managed to run the sample applications. The
Tutorial is a bit wrong about the path. Here is how it starts. Make sure you have called gradle installApp in the folder of the tutorial. This will create a folder install in the build folder. THe correct call to the application is
    ./rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/build/install/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_torial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker

The same holds for the other tutorials and for self generated apps.
