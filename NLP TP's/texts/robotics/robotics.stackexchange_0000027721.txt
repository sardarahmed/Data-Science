Q:

Gazebo Transport Messages: No standard messages for double, uint32, string, etc?

It seems like the transport message types that come built-in with gazebo don't have any standard messages for things like a double, uint32, string, etc.  I did manage to find one for an int32 under gazebo::msgs, but that's it.  Am I somehow missing the rest?

A:

For string there is GzString, and as you said there is one for int32. But I guess that's all.
For the other types you'd need to define custom messages, as explained here.

Yea I figured I'd have to make my own custom messages for the basic types.  If I can summon the energy, maybe I'll integrate them into gazebo::msgs and do a pull request.
