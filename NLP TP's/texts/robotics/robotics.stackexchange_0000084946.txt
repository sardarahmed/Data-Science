Q:

how to change wireless network when start robot with reboot machine?

I want to change wireless network dynamically.I use robot_upstart package to automatically start the robot launch file when reboot machine. Before I want to change wireless network with command linenmcli device wifi connect <SSID> password <PASSWORD> everything is good.I have tried subprocess,envoy and os.system in my python scripts,they are work well with roslaunch,but they are all not work with the service generated by robot_upstart.But I have tried manually write the scripts into service file,it can change wireless network.Is there something wrong with nmcli and robot_upstart?

A:

Typically, those things somehow have to do with the permissions.
To quote the docs:

It’s important to understand how
permissions work robot_upstart:

1.The upstart job invokes its jobname-start bash script as root.

2.The script sets up environment variables, and then uses setuidgid to
execute roslaunch as an unprivileged
user. This is by default the user who
ran the install script, but it can
also be specified explicitly via a
flag.

3.The roslaunch which executes does not have its user’s group memberships.
This means that it will not have
access to serial ports with the
dialout group, or locations in
/var/log owned by root, etc. Any
filesystem resources needed by your
ROS nodes should be chowned to the
same unprivileged user which will run
ROS, or should set to world
readable/writeable, for example using
udev.
