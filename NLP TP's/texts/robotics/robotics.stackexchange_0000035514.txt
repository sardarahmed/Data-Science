Q:

How can I set the path so the programs are always found?

so far, I have installed UBUNTU.
I have installed ROS.
I have installed various relative Programs like Turtle-bot, etc.
When I try to run the programs, the ROS can't find the files. How can I set the path so the programs are always found? it seems that I am doing this the hardway. What is the easyway?

Your question title could be a bit more expressive, "What do i do now?" basically is the underlying theme of 80% of questions here :)

A:

I would suggest taking a look at the introductory tutorials - particularly configuring the ROS environment.  That includes information on setting up paths.
