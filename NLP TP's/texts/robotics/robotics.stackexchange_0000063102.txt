Q:

What should be written in catkin_package?

Hello, my name is Kaori Furuike.
I have a question about "10. Creating msg and srv" in beginner level tutorials. (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv)
It tells us to make sure we export the message runtime dependency.
catkin_package(
  ...
  CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
  ...) 

But there is no statement like "CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ..." in my catkin_package.
And when I run without such a statement, I got this error message.
"Unable to load msg [beginner_tutorials/Num]: Cannot locate message [Num]: unknown package [beginner_tutorials] on search path [{'rosconsole': ['/opt/ros/hydro/share/rosconsole/msg'], ..."

Would you tell me what is (or what shold be) written in catkin_package at beginner_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt ?
Thank you.

Sorry for my late reply.
And thank you for your help. I finally succeeded to build this program.
catkin_package(
CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime
}
was enough actually in this case. But I did not understand what catkin_package was, so the HP was very helpful.
