Q:

RuntimeError: !!! multi_level_map is not a package name nor a repository name

I can't figure out why my pre-release test is failing.
Jenkins builds and tests all the packages, then complains:
Get list of wet repositories that build-depend on repo list multi_level_map
prerelease script failed. Check out the console output above for details.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/rosbuild/hudson/workspace/prerelease-groovy-multi_level_map/ARCH_PARAM/amd64/UBUNTU_PARAM/precise/label/prerelease/jenkins_scripts/prerelease", line 47, in <module>
    raise ex
RuntimeError: !!! multi_level_map is not a package name nor a repository name

As best I can tell, multi_level_map is both a metapackage name and a repository name.
Any suggestions?

A:

Since there has been no answer, I suppose this must be a bug.
Ticket: Jenkins issue #14
