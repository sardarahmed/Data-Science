Q:

How to check whether message is the same as sent by the publisher?

I want to check whether data send by the publisher is the same as received by the subscriber. So is this check already done by the ROS or i have to use CRC , checksum like methods within the messages to ensure that data is correct .

A:

If your publisher and subscriber are using TCPROS as the transport, then I'd say payload integrity is taken care of by the checksumming and retransmits inherent to TCP itself.
As to UDPROS, it uses UDP (..), which does have checksumming, but no reliability mechanisms (retransmitting corrupted datagrams fi). The checksum is also optional.
For any other transports (rosserial comes to mind), you'll have to investigate the included recovery mechanisms yourself (for rosserial, see rosserial/Overview/Protocol - Packet Format, which indicates there is a checksum included).

Thanks.I have to send the messages from raspberrypi to arduino through rosserial . How to access the checksum value from the packet. According to the link u have given above,does size of a packet of N byte message data is N+8 bytes

I don't know the details, but according to the screenshots in ROS Arduino message type restrictions? fi, rosserial already checks for corruptions. I think it then drops those packets.
