Q:

joint_state_publisher like joint_trajectory_action GUI tool

I like joint_state_publisher for debug of URDF models.
I want to use some GUI tool for debug of gazebo simulation model.
Is there any tool that publishes(?) pr2_controllers_msgs/JointTrajectory.action messages like joint_state_publisher's gui?
I'm using Fuerte and Ubuntu12.04.

Hi, I also encountered same situation. Did you already find the tool publishing JointTrajectoryAction?

A:

To revive an old question...
I found the easiest way was to load a JointPosition or JointVelocity based controller instead, which should be in the same stack, and feed in the appropriate command.
