Q:

What is the stop condition of tracking

When the tracking process is over, what makes it stop? I use waypoint_ Loader, in pure_pursuit Using dialog
I appreciate it if you have any idea.

I'm not sure I understand your question. Tracking is used to track the movement of objects.

Sorry, the words are not accurate. I want to know Stop condition of pure_ pursuit algorithm In autoware

A:

pure_pursuit only controls lateral movement - not longitudinal - so it does not cause the vehicle to stop. velocity_set is a node which typically causes the vehicle to stop and the conditions depend on your parameter settings. However, in general, velocity_set looks for lidar points within a certain sphere around each waypoint. If the number of lidar points within that sphere exceeds a threshold (set in your parameter settings) then it reduces the velocity to 0 before that waypoint.
