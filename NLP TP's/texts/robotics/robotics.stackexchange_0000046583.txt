Q:

ROS fuerte installation problem on 12.04

Hello!
I use VMware to load Mint13 (same as Ubuntu 12.04) and then follow the installation steps on the "Ubuntu install of Fuerte" page.
But when it comes to "sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full" I get an error message
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-desktop-full
I have tried several times but it is still unable to locate package.
How can I overcome this problem and install the ROS? Thanks you!

I'm having the same problem today on Ubuntu 12.04.1. Sources list is correct and most ROS fuerte packages appear when I try tab complete of apt-get install ros-fuerte-
I have tried both packages.ros.org and the CWRU mirror. Perhaps something is broken in the deb build for desktop-full today?

Same problem with me too on xubuntu 12.04

A:

There was a sytax error in the fuerte.rosdistro file which crashed the variant metapackage generation.  The error was fixed last night and the script was made robust to the error as well.  This should be fixed now.  Make sure to apt-get update.
