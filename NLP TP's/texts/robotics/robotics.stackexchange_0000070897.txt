Q:

Error Installing ROS on Debian Stretch

I am trying to install ROS on Debian Stretch running on a Beaglebone Black using the instructions here
http://wiki.ros.org/Debian/Installation/Source
the script file install_ros.sh gives the following error while executing
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

==> cmake /home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/src/catkin -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/catkin -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Unix Makefiles in '/home/debian/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/catkin'
Unhandled exception of type 'OSError':

Any help would be appreciated

A:

After a bit of detective work I have worked out what the problem is. 'cmake' is not part of the standard Debian installation on the Beaglebone Black. Installing cmake with 'sudo apt-get install cmake' fixed this problem.
If I can edit the ROS wiki I will add the command to the script file.
My beaglebone is currently compiling ROS, has been coming up with some warnings which require the package 'python-nose'. Are these warnings important?

Well you can, it's a wiki. Just register for an account, and you should be able to edit anything.

Edited wiki, added 'sudo apt-get install cmake python-nose' to install script
