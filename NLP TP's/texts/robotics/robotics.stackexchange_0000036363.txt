Q:

Rxbag is not publishing

Hi!
I've recorded a bag file useing rxbag --record -a -o all.bag.
When I want to play it I run rxbag all_2011_12_09_10_10_20.bag and the rxbag window opens and I can play, see the graphics, everithing. But it is not publishing the data to rostopics. What do I need to do?
Thanks.

A:

rxbag only publishes to topics that you explicitly select. Right-click on the topics list in the rxbag window and choose the topics you're interested in (or "Publish All") in the "Publish..." popup menu.
