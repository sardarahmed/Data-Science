Q:

Problems Connecting to serial Port :/dev/ACM0

I've been stuck on this for a while my problem is I cant access GPS data for a ublox node. I am connecting to a Raspberry pi 3 that is running a RPI 2 Snappy Image. I am connecting to the PI through a SSH on a ubuntu 14.04 laptop.
I am running the following command and getting this error: (updated output with correct port spelling)
    ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ roslaunch ublox_gps ublox_device.launch 
... logging to /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/cefae814-d237-11e7-8ade-b827ebffc577/roslaunch-ubuntu-1799.log

I checked that the port was correct by using
cat /dev/ttyACM0 

it outputted my GPS Data that I was looking for, I assumed that I was permission were off so I did the command
groups

this is the output
ubuntu adm dialout cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev netdev lxd

it says I'm in the dialout group, so i assumed my permissions were fine.
when I do
ls -la /dev/ttyACM0
crw-rw-rw- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Feb 11  2016 /dev/ttyACM0

So there is a problem with my # after dialout its should be 666 right? I tried using
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyAMC0 

No change to the permissions.
Does anyone know how to change the dialout 166 problem? thanks - or any other solutions that would allow me to open the port or read the GPS Data.

The error message said there was no file /dev/ACM0, and then you start to explain the effort put into /dev/ttyAMC0. They're not the same thing.

Sorry I miss typed into the launch file parameters, but i retested it with /dev/ttyACM0 and got the same result.
Comment by pacifickid9 on 2017-11-25:
I think i spelled it wrong I got another error so this one must have been solved thanks guys ill be more careful next time!

A:

but i retested it with /dev/ttyACM0

can you please check again? It's ttyAMC0, not ttyACM0.
After you've changed the launch file / parameters, update your original post to show us the output.
