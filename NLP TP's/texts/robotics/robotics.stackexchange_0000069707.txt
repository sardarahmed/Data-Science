Q:

How to change package name after release?

I've released a package named hpcl_rtt, for some reason i want to change the package name to micros_rtt.
I've done the local work in my repository. What else should i do in bloom?

A:

Bloom will scan your repository when run and should release the new package and not release the old package. The pull request will change the packages indexed to the current state of your repository and it should not need any more intervention.

The already built packages with the old names should be removed from the apt repos then. I guess this has to be done manually.
