Q:

How can Navigation with openStreetMap osm

After I publish osm_cartography and can see the map in rviz, what do I do next to make the robot navigate through the map? Do I use move_base or some other package? If I use move_base, how can I load this map to move_base? Or if there's another package, what package would it be?

A:

First of all, welcome to Roboticks Stack Exchange! osm_cartography only publishes the OSRM information for visualization purposes. In that case, you would have to create some software that could translate the VisualMarkers into other message such as Lines, or RoadLines and follow them, or either use the OSRM API to ask a destination, and again, create some piece of software that splits the information from the response you received. If you want move_base to work with OSRM map, I don't think there's no way to create a map directly using the information from the osm_cartography
