Q:

Nav2 Local and Global Plugins

Is there a way to change runtime plugins like below for local and global costmap from BT in order to disable obstacle_layer as needed  ?
plugins: ["plugin1", "plugin2"]
plugin1: ["voxel_layer", "inflation_layer"]
plugin2: ["voxel_layer", "inflation_layer", "obstacle_layer"]

A:

All of the layers have an enabled parameter that you can dynamically set on/off as you like.
