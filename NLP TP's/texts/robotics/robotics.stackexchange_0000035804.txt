Q:

ardu pilot mavlink

I am trying to connect ardu pilot mega to ROS on ubuntu. I believe it has to be done using mavlink-ros-pkg but there is absolutely no documentation on how to get it running. Has anyone done this before? I would really appreciate if I could get some pointers. Thanks!

Were you able to get this working?

A:

Here is as far as I got (not very far.)
However, I just needed to get raw sensor data off of my APM-based quadrotor so I ended up writing a simple node that reads the RAW_GPS MAVLink message type and posts a GPSFix message.
You might find this post useful to get started.
It's always best to reuse code (ie get ros-mavlink-pkg working) than to reinvent the wheel--but if it turns out ros-mavlink-pkg is dead, it's fairly trivial to get data out of MAVLink.
