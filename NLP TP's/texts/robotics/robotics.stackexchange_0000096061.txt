Q:

Autoware - Localization in the desert

What is the best way to improve localization in the desert if LiDAR is unable to do so?
I have Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR which has a range of 100m (although for matching with ndt map, it does not go beyond 15m for small shrubs). Hence for a location like in Mojave Desert in the link shown below. localization using LiDAR fails.

Environment: Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic, Autoware 1.12.0

A:

GPS seems to be a good choice, modern multi-band GPS are very good and in the desert, you should have no issues having line of sight with at least 4 satellites. I can't think of a better place to do that!
