Q:

Is it possible to convert std_msgs/Int8 to a binary number?

I am currently trying to convert a std_msgs/Int8 messsage that I receive from a topic to a binary number in python.
The way I am currently doing it is by doing this dirty hack.
bin(int(str(data))) 

but isn't there any nice way to do this? I mean this is python so something clever should be there...

A:

I'm not sure why you're converting to a string and then back to an int.
If you have an Int8, you should be able to call bin() on the data member directly:
# Import the Int8 message definition
from std_msgs.msg import Int8

# create an Int8 message and assign 32 to it
num = Int8()
num.data = 32

# call bin() on our Int8 data and print the result
print bin(num.data)
