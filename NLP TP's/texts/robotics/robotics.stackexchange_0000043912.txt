Q:

No email notifications for updates on my questions

Although Follow is pressed, email the updates is ticked, Email me when there are any new answers is ticked as well I do not receive any e-mail notifications. Neither for new answers nor comments.
I am using Google account to log in.
Does anyone experience the same?

A:

The emails will come to your ROS Account.
On this page, in the top right just below tags you can find that you logged in.
If there is any message for you, then the icon msg icon will change its colour.
