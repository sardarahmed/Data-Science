Q:

Openni Kinect Drivers

Hi,
I'm new to the kinect development and I was trying to install the openni_kinect stack. However when I tried to follow the instructions to install it (http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect) it seems like the branch for the drivers (https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers) has been closed. Is it possible to just download the openni drivers from the Openni site and link it to ros? If so how?
Thanks.

Is there anything particular I should be looking at? That is the site I have been using, and I was referring to Step 1. hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers and I get a server error because the branch has been closed.

Hi,
I just tested again on my computer and this line does work:
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers
May be you should just try again / check your network? Can you access the url via your webbrowser, etc...
Cheers,

I am absolutely baffled. I swear this wasn't working 2 hours ago, but it seems to be working now. Thanks!
