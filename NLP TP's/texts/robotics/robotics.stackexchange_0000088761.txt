A:

ROS 2 doesn't have / need dynamic_reconfigure. The functionality has been integrated into the parameter subsystem (see the corresponding design article).
rqt has not been ported to ROS 2 at this time.

will rqt be ported in the future ? and when ?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2018-08-29:
Yes, as soon as someone has time to work on it...
Comment by lxbeyond on 2018-08-29:
as I know, parameter subsystem of python lacks some function as to c++, and it seems to not be able to support dynamic_reconfigure.

Parameter support in rclpy has just recently been merged so you will need to build from master to use it. I have no idea what you mean with "it seems to not be able to support dynamic_reconfigure"?
