Q:

moveit-noetic, How to attach one object with two end-effectors?

i'm trying to grasp one object with two arms(A arm and B arm) by this process.

Attach object with A arm (l_tool_frame).
Attach object with B arm (r_tool_frame).

but it didn't work. when i attach the object to B arm, It is automatically detached from A arm.
I want to attach the object with two arms.
Is there any way to do this?

This code is the first way i tried it.
moveit_msgs::AttachedCollisionObject l_pad_attach;
pad_attach.link_name = ("l_tool_frame");
pad_attach.object = add_object[0];
current_scene.applyAttachedCollisionObject( pad_attach );

moveit_msgs::AttachedCollisionObject r_pad_attach;
pad_attach.link_name = ("r_tool_frame");
pad_attach.object = add_object[0];
current_scene.applyAttachedCollisionObject( pad_attach );

This code is the second way i tried it.
moveit_msgs::AttachedCollisionObject pad_attach;
pad_attach.link_name = ("l_tool_frame","r_tool_frame");

pad_attach.object = add_object[0];
current_scene.applyAttachedCollisionObject( pad_attach );

There is no error, but it is attached only to "r_tool_frame"
Thank you

A:

I don't think that standard moveit supports this. The moveit system makes the simplifying assumption that a kinematic chain has only a single "pathway" of links from root to "object". I don't know how much custom code it would take for you to support a closed-loop chain configuration.

I was waiting for another comment, but seeing that it hasn't been commented yet, there must be no solution yet!
