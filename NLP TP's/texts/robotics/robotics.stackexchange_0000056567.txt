Q:

Error trying to run hokuyo on groovy

I haven't used ROS for about a month to two months, and before this, I've managed to get hokuyo working fine. But just yesterday, I tried to use it again but failed. I run roscore, then in a new terminal, run rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node, but I'm faced with an error:
[ERROR] [1389842311.466153862]: Exception thrown while opening Hokuyo.
buffer filled without end of line being found (in hokuyo::laser::laserReadline) You may find further details at http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting

I've seen the troubleshooting page but my error isn't there. I've also tried to uninstall the package using sudo apt-get remove ros-groovy-laser-drivers and reinstalling it with sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-laser-drivers but that didn't help at all.
Would anyone know what happened? I'm just really puzzled because it worked perfectly before.

A:

Have you check your port? In default, hokuyo run on /dev/ttyACM0, do you check whether that port is used by some other device?
Let me know if this helps.

Thanks it helped! My /dev/ttyACM0 was arduino.
