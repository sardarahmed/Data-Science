Q:

Start writing drivers

Hi there,
we are starting a project and we want to implement new sensors and actuators for our ROS-project.
My task is to provide the e.g. data of an IR sensor or implement I2C-bus.
My first thought was: Poll the sensor and write a publisher.
But I guess you guys are more expirience in such a task, so I want to ask you first.
While I have expirience with ROS already, I have never done such a thing.
Do you have any good idea where to start or any tutorial how I can write a driver in ROS?
Greetz,
tiko

A:

How do you interface the I2C bus? Directly from the computer?
If you have no interface yet look at the arduino I2C tutorials:

Hi davinci,
thanks for the quick answer.
We do it in a similar way, by having the libraries already.
Anyway, I was just concerned about the way to talk with such sensors and actuator.
But as I thought, it is just the straight way by writing a simple publisher.
Thanks!
