Q:

Mechano wheels instead of cylinders?

Hi, I'd like to insert "mechano wheels" (or other "cool' wheels) in my model instead of simple cylinders.
What do you suggest me?
Thanks

A:

I haven't follow this tutorial myself but it seems exactly what you need.
And there is another example of model with "cool wheels".
