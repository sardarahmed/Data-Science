Q:

Openrave ikfast as an ik plugin for motion planning

Hi, all,
I want to make use of the strength of Openrave to get the analytic solutions for our 5dof manipulator. I know in orrosplanning package, ik_openrave.py provide a service /GetPositionIK. But I want a IK plugin to be loaded by ompl_ros_interface for motion planning. I just wonder how could I configure the Openrave IK module into a plugin? I heard that openrave could generate a C++ file as the inverse kinematics for the given manipulator, is it possible to use it to build a plugin. What would be the best way to do it and how to do it? Thanks.

Hi Fei,
i just wanted to tell you that we (Martin and I) just pushed the latest version of our  katana_driver stack, which now supports constraint aware motion planning for our arm.
The set up is the following:

we fully specified the arms kinematics in a urdf file and coverted file into the collada format from which openrave then computed the analytical solution cpp files(see katana_description)
then we implemented a kinematics plugin (as Gil suggested above), which does not calls the generated cpp files directly, but via the orroplanning/IK service specifiying to use the TranslationDirection5D IK type (see katana_openrave_kinematics)
we then use the plugin with the arm_kinematics_constraint_aware node from the same package
to establish all necessary service (see katana_openrave_kinematics)

with this set up we are now able to use OMPL within our for our arm navigation. I hope looking through our files will help you setting up your arm. We also included some code for testing within the katana_openrave_test package.
Please feel free to e-mail me if you could need more detailed support or in cases you find some bugs or other ideas for improvement.
Greetings from Osnabr√ºck,
Henning
