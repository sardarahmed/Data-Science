Q:

PkgConfig in Groovy on Quantal

I'm having with a job on the buildfarm.
http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-groovy-people-tracking-filter_binarydeb_quantal_i386/2/console
Probably relevant error:
-- Could NOT find PkgConfig (missing:  PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE) 
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:319 (message):
  pkg-config tool not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:333 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
  CMakeLists.txt:6 (pkg_check_modules)

Offending CMake is here: https://github.com/wg-perception/people/blob/groovy/people_tracking_filter/CMakeLists.txt
What is the proper way to check for the BFL package in Groovy that will work on the buildfarm?

A:

It is perfectly fine to use pkg-config to resolve dependencies but if a package does so it also needs to declare that pkg-config is a build dependency in the package.xml file:
<build_depend>pkg-config</build_depend>

Otherwise the build farm does not know that it should be installed.

Hrm. Didn't seem to take: http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-groovy-people-tracking-filter_binarydeb_precise_i386/4/console

How should it change? You haven't released a new patch release, right? The recent deb-inc still uses the same upstream code: https://github.com/OSUrobotics/people-release/blob/release/groovy/people_tracking_filter/1.0.6-1/package.xml - no pkg-config dependency in there.
