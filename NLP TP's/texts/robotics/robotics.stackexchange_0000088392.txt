Q:

rospy.wait_for_message just hangs

there is no exception or anything, rospy.wait_for_message just hangs, and no result is returned, and no subsequent code is executed. running
rostopic echo /my_topic

is able to yield result. Someone can provide an example of how to use wait_fo_message?

A:

Take a look at the documentation. Or, if you look at the source for the wait_for_message function, you'll see that you can specifiy a timeout. If that timeout is exceeded then an exception will be raised (I removed the parts that aren't necessary for the question)
def wait_for_message(topic, topic_type, timeout=None):
    """
    ...

    @param timeout: timeout time in seconds
    @type  timeout: double
    ...
    @raise ROSException: if specified timeout is exceeded
    """

So, just call the function like this
rospy.wait_for_message(my_topic, MyMessage, my_timeout)

and if my_timeout is exceeded a ROSException will be raised.

No need to go to the source, just read the documentation.
