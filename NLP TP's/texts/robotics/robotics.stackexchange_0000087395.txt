Q:

Pointcloud to LaserScan for Navigation

Hi,
I want to do navigation for my mobile robot. I have an IMU, wheel encoder and laser scanner. For this, I guess, I have to convert pointcloud to laserscan. Do you have any idea about this converting. I looked at http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan page. But I didn't understand anything. Please help me about this situation

You're going to need to be a little more specific on what you don't understand. Have you tried running the node? Do you understand the difference between a PointCloud2 msg and a LaserScan msg?

In my study, I transformed the laserscan message into a point cloud to obtain a three-dimensional image of the environment and obtained a three-dimensional image of the environment with a vertical scanning plane. But I suppose you need a laserscan message with a horizontal scan plane to navigate.

@stevejp So I know I need to make a conversion to the laser from the point cloud. Am I right?

What sensor are you using? Are you using a 2d lidar, a 3d lidar or a kinect camera?  If you have a laser scanner it directly gives output as LasersScan msg which is needed for the navigation stack.

Yes, I use a 2d laser scanner.

A:

which is the scanner you are using? The output is usually ideally laserscan msg under /scan topic. If you get pointcloud msg you can do something like this. This is example for using kinect as a fake laser scanner source.
 <node pkg="depthimage_to_laserscan" type="depthimage_to_laserscan" name="depthimage_to_laserscan">
  <remap from="image"     to="/camera/depth/depth_registered"/>
  <remap from="camera_info" to="/camera/depth/camera_info"/>
  <remap from="scan" to="/scan"/>
</node>

Mr. @PratNag I am using hokuyo urg-04lx-ug01 laser scanner. Yes ı can get laserscan msg but ı converted laserscan into pointcloud. Now, for navigation I guess I have to convert this pointcloud to laserscan? havent  ı?
Comment by PratNag on 2018-06-19:
No you dont need to. You can use the laserscan topic from hokoyu directly for navigation stack. The original msg published by the laser scanner is not modified when you convert it to pointcloud.

Thank you Mr. @PratNag
