Q:

ROS Android project-rosmake failed

Hi guys, I am trying to set up the environment for developing a ROS Android application and I followed the tutorial here and I got stuck when I tried to rosmake "android_app_chooser". At first I get the error "Failed to find stack for package actionlib_java", but then by following  the tutorial to downgrade the rosjava_android repository seems to have solve the error.
So I run the rosmake command again, but this time I get another error "Failed to find rosdep daemontools for package android_app_chooser on OS:ubuntu version:lucid
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: Rosdep install failed ". Can anyone tell me where I did wrong and help me solve the problem?
Edit1:By the way, by browsing through other questions here I found some proposed solution such as running sudo apt-get install ros-electric-turtlebot but to no success as when I tried to run sudo-apt-get install daemontools it says my daemontools is already the latest version.
P/S: Honestly I have tried few approaches on setting up such environment but to no success so far. I would really appreciate if someone can upload a VM image that can run the android examples as well as developing one. Thanks a lot.

A:

The current way to do Android / ROS development is to use the android_core package by Damon Kohler. I don't think the ROS electric Android stuff is supported any more.

I have followed the android_core package by Damon Kohler and it works well.  This is the correct and current way to do ROS on Android.
