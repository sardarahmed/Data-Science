Q:

publish camera_info and undistort image

Hi, I'm using a node on en jetson nano running melodic, that publish Image topics.
I will calibrate the camera with cameracalibration.py in order to get calibration yaml file.
Then I will need to undistort (rectifie?) the image using data from yaml file.
Is there a package, node, tool that read a yaml file, subscribe to image topic and publish camera_info and undistorted images?
Thank

Take a look at image_proc it should be able to handle exactly your problem.

ok, that's a middle point becouse it needs a camera_info message.
So, I need a package/node that reads yaml calibration file and publish a camera_info. do you know any?

Unfortunately i don't, but writing a node yourself does not seem to complicated. Take a look at this for reference
