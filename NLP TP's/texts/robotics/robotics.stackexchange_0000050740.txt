Q:

Laptop recommendations

I'm picking out a laptop that will be exclusively used for ROS development. Does anyone have any recommendations for a specific model? I've got my eye on a Thinkpad T530, but I've heard of problems with Nvidia Optimus. I saw that a new driver has been released this month - how well does that work?
Edit: I'm going to be doing a lot of RViz/PCL stuff, so I need some horsepower

A:

Not clear what you specifically want to work on but there's already a similar thread.

I'm curious as to how well the new Nvidia Linux driver (the one that fixes the Optimus issues) works with rviz and gazebo.
