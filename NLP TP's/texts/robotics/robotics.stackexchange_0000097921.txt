Q:

Cmake error when creating a new workspace in windows

when i creating a new workspace(in windouws)  using
colcon build --merge-install

this error happend.
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (findcolcon package):
  By not providing "FindQt5.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5", but
  CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5" (requested
  version 5.9.5) with any of the following names:

    Qt5Config.cmake
    qt5-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt5" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Qt5_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Qt5" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

i dont know why,and dont konw how to fix it.
Does someone konw how to fix it? Iwould be appreciated!

I have the same issue. Did you install from binaries? Which ROS2 version and patch release are you using?

By the way, I think this is a duplicate to this question.
