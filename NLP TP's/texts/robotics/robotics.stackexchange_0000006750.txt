Q:

Does an electronic compass work underwater

I'm building a submersible ROV, so I need a way to navigate. So using a compass would help but this brings up the question, does an electronic compass work underwater?
My thoughts are the water might act as a faraday cage, and therefore interfere with the magnetic field. Therefore it might not even work. Maybe a gyroscope might be a better solution.

A:

A compass will work just fine under water, I am an avid scuba diver and a compass is a standard piece of kit for navigating.
