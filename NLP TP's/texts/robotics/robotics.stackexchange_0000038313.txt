Q:

rxbag segfault on view Image RAW data

Although it might not be very useful, when I select Raw view for an Image type topic in rxbag, I get a segfault.
Could somebody confirm this behaviour?
I'm using ros-electric on ubuntu oneiric.
It's happened to me in two different PCs (laptop and desktop, with pretty different hardware but almost the same environment).
BTW, I'm using image_rect_color topics, from the image_pipeline stack, so images should be sane.
Thanks.
UPDATE Defect ticket created.

For debugging a problem like this, a gdb stack backtrace of the segfault is usually needed.

How do I backtrace rxbag with gdb? I've tried https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Backtrace, but gdb says that rxbag is 'not in executable format: File format not recognized'. I just run 'gdb rxbag' (w/ and w/o args, a .bag file).

My mistake. I did not realize rxbag was a Python script.

So, how could I find out what's going on? Do you or somebody knows?

A:

You can open a defect ticket, providing all the information you can for the rxbag maintainer.
