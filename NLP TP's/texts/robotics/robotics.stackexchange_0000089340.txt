Q:

Looking for existing Electromyograph EMG/EEG, or voltage messages

I am in the process of implementing a ROSBag writer for an electromyograh device.
Before implementing my own messages, I would like to know if such messages already exist.
Basically I al looking for Electromyograph EMG/EEG messages, or, if they don't exist, a basic voltage message of the type:
Header header
float64 voltage
float64 variance

I don't know if there already exists the message you need. But you can create your own ROS message and use that. Look here for more information.

.. that could become a standard in the (near) future.

A:

I'm not aware of a message set for EEG/EMG.
There was a lightning talk about a (consumer) EEG device last ROSCon (this one), but that doesn't seem to include reusable messages.
Might make sense to propose some new msgs ..
