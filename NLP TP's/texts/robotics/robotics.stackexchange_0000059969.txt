Q:

FCL Linking with catkin build

I've just switched from catkin_make_isolated to catkin tools for building ROS from source. I added the --install command but I'm getting errors when building MoveIt! in a different workspace after sourcing the ROS installed from source workspace:
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
LIBFCL_LIBRARIES_FULL
    linked by target "moveit_collision_detection_fcl" in directory /home/dave/ros/ws_moveit/src/moveit_core/collision_detection_fcl

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

There is something wrong with FCL or my environment, but I am not sure what to do. I have already built several other workspaces on top of the ROS-installed-from-source one, so it seems to mostly be working. Thanks!
--- EDIT ---
Perhaps this might be useful: there were some issues with FCL on this ROS Answer and there was a fix in moveit_core as noted in the changelog for 0.5.7

A:

Okay, I figured out my mistake. Although I (later) added the --install argument, I had still forgotten to source the /install/setup.bash but instead was only sourcing /devel/setup.bash like I do for my other, regular catkin workspaces. I guess because the ROS-from-source workspace includes non-ROS packages this is really important.
Thanks jbohren for the help!
