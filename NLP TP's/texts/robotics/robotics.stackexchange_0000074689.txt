Q:

How to create a 2D map with kinect sensor?

I am a beginner in ROS. I don't have a laser so I have been trying to create map with kinect sensor. Unfortunately I haven't been able to figure out where I am going wrong. I tried using depth_image to laser_scan but to no avail, it is not converting the image to scan. I am using freenect. I can see pointcloud data from the kinect in rviz in real time and I am stuck there. Can anyone help me out with a tutorial or some points I have to follow step by step?

http://wiki.ros.org/navigation
and remember you need odometery data you can git it from encoder and imu
this tutorial must help you to understand what you need to do.
