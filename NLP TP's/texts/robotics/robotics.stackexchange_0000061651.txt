Please fix it, I'm in hurry.

Seriously?

A:

Diamondback has been EOL (end of life) for a long time (http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions#End_of_Life_.28EOL.29_Distribution_Releases). Please use currently supported distros such as hydro or indigo.

I'm trying to implement a code which is using ROS Diamondback, that's why i want to install Diamond back. What should i do?

I'm afraid you won't find much support for problems with Diamondback, in particular not for free, and certainly not by saying "I'm in a hurry". You can either try to fix issues yourself, or try to port the code to a recent ROS version.
Comment by demmeln on 2014-08-10:
I suggest the latter. You can raise any concrete issues you encounter while porting the code here on answers.ros.org. If you ask politely, you might get some help.
Comment by Rm4n2aa on 2014-08-10:
Thanks for your help, I'll do the latter.
I really didn't mean to be rude, and I apologize for that.

No harm done. Just remember that most people here are donating their free time to help others. Keeping that in mind will increase your chances of getting help. Good luck with your code!
