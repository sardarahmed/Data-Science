Q:

datatype/md5sum error

Hi!
I've been trying to run link text and i constantly get this error:
[ERROR] [1575375869.500571590]: Client [/firefly/trajectory_sampler] wants topic /firefly/path_segments to have datatype/md5sum [mav_planning_msgs/PolynomialTrajectory/2daf5d705534e84f80980f4673a0e62b], but our version has [mav_planning_msgs/PolynomialTrajectory4D/4d68d15524ede489eecd674bb6dc3ee8]. Dropping connection.

I was told that i may need another version of mav_comm folder ( link text ) but no matter what i try i get the same error.
Can anyone tell me how to fix that??
Thank you!
I use ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic.

Having the exact same problem (and same environmental setup).
Is there guidance which we could follow to compile with the same version of the mav_planning_msgs package?
Thank you very much for help.

A:

You need to make sure you've compiled both pieces of software with the same version of the mav_planning_msgs package.
Something has changed in that message between versions so they don't line up. More than just that, it looks like you're using the wrong message type.
mav_planning_msgs/PolynomialTrajectory != mav_planning_msgs/PolynomialTrajectory4D
