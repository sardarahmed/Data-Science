Q:

lrmate200ic automode

Please, help me,
I work with fanuc lrmate200ic (V7.7 with R648 and R632) and ROS Hydro. I have done basic configuration. I began to test steering of an indstrial robot but the robot executes commands only under the T1 mode. When I switch the robot in auto mode and run a ros TPE program i see only
I RREL Waiting for ROS traj relay

message and when i run command
roslaunch fanuc_lrmate200ic_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=false robot_ip:=IP_OF_ROBOT

on PC, TP displays message Connected. But, further communication is not possible.

Running the fanuc_driver Karel & TP programs in AUTO mode is definitely possible. Can you check the robot's error log, and please update your question (use the edit button/link) with the exact steps you take to start the ros TPE program (ie: programs selected, buttons pressed, etc).

A:

Thank you very much, you were right, error was in the process. It was necessary to enter into the ros  TPE program and after that press cycle start on control panel. Thanks for your time.
