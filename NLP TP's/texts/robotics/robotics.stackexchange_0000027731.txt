Q:

The model editor imports my model as a block

If I go to the model editor and imports a previously saved model (or any existing model) it is being imported as a single model instead of a group of parts that can be selected individually. If I click the model there is no "Open link editor" option, just copy and delete.
I'm using gazebo8 nightly: 7.99.00+hg20160430rb016c48c553c-1~wily

A:

This is because is being imported as a model so it can be used in model nesting or other operations. To get access again to the parts the following actions needs to be performed:

Exist the Model editor to the simulation window
Insert your model
Select it, right click, edit model

And all the links and joints appear again as when you initially created the model.
