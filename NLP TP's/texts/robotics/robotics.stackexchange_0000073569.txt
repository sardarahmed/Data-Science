Q:

Installing Gazebo2

Hi,
I am running ROS indigo and trying to install Gazebo2.  Trying to follow these instructions: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions
I have deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main listed in my sources.
When I do an apt-cache search only gazebo5 shows up.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Matt

I checked the repository and confirmed that the gazebo2 deb is present in the repo and it's listed in the Packages file. I have also confirmed that gazebo2 appears when I do an apt-cache search on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine.

is it different if I am on an arm processor?
Comment by Droter on 2016-04-26:
I can see gazebo5-common and gazebo5-doc and that is all
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-04-26:
ARM is significantly different. There are no armhf debs for gazebo2 in the repository.

A:

No armhf debs for gazebo2 in repository.
