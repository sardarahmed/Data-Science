Q:

How to use sample from AR_track_ALVAR

Hello,
I'm trying to run the sample "sampleTrack.cpp". When the program is running it is not able to open the camera because it need to use highgui plugin.
So I added Cmakelists.txt from platform to the main Cmakelist with add_subdirectory(src/platform) but when doing my catkin_make, i'm encountering an issue :
CMake Error at ar_track_alvar/src/platform/CMakeLists.txt:62 (add_library): Cannot find source file: Capture.h Tried extensions .c .C .c++ .cc .cpp .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp  .hxx .in .txx

It can't find headers even if they are in the good directory.
I think there is an easy way to use those samples but there is not mutch ALVAR documentation so I Have no idea how to fix the problem.
Thanks in advance!

A:

If you want a simple example of the ALVAR tracking bridge in ROS you can check this answer. Or directly the examples on this repo.
If you want to use the original ALVAR library. From what you say all you're missing is highgui in you package. So adding a find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED components core highgui) to you cmakelist should do the job.
Hope this helps,
