Q:

Why I am getting Exception sending a message when starting Gazebo and how to solve it?

I have ROS melodic and Gazebo 9 in my system.
When I type
gazebo

in my terminal, I am getting following message:
Exception sending a message

that keeps on printing in terminal console.
How should I resolve this issue?

Could you try launching it like this to see if anything changes: rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo --verbose

Surprisingly, I didn't encounter this exception message today, either with your proposed method or just by typing 'gazebo' in command line. I wonder why it happened.

Hi @Raskkii , today I encountered this problem again and it occurs even when I type
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo --verbose

Same here, but don't use ros with it. The only special thing is that my home directory is nfs mounted.

same here also. ros melodic + gazebo 9

A:

I also ran into this problem. This happens only when I open a VPN connection. Setting the environment variable IGN_IP to 127.0.0.1 solved this problem. Here is the discussion
