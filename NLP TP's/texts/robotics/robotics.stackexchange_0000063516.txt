Q:

Problems with hector_slam Tutorials MappingUsingLoggedData

I am trying to run : hector_slam Tutorials MappingUsingLoggedData with Hydro.  After I launch everything, I don't get any thing on Rviz.
Here is the warning that I am getting:
[ INFO] [1414325137.230751975]: Geotiff node started [ WARN] [1414325156.252540097]: No transform between frames /map and scanmatcher_frame available after 20.003600 seconds of waiting. This warning only prints once.

It shows scan match is not well, may be you are moving in long straight corridor or less laser scan rate or very fast moving vehicle.

I did manage to get the tutorial.launch running without any errors, but I still don't have anything showing on Rviz.

try saving map with mapsaver to check if problem with just visualisation.

A:

I was crowding my CPU too much, and was not giving mapsaver long enough.  I shutdown some of the processes running on the CPU and everything worked ok.
