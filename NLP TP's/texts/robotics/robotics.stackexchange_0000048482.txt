Q:

ros_lib arduino IDE issue Rosserial

Hi.
Im trying to use ros with the arduino, using the following rosserial tutorials.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
After installing the Arduino IDE on Ubuntu 12.04 and copying the ros_lib folder into the sketchbook/libraries folder, I found that the IDE had not included these new files into the import library or the examples menu.
I tried copying the required header files for the hello world tutorial into the same folder as the hello world sketch but the compiler could not find them. I looked around and found that all the header files in the library need .cpp files or thats what i understand.
So basically i am unable to include any of these ros_lib files.
Can any one help?

A:

Make sure you install the ardunio ide into /usr/share. It seems that if you install in other places it doesn't contruct the links it needs.
