Q:

urdf tutorial in groovy

When trying to visualize the simplest model in the urdf tutorial "Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch" using the following command in Groovy:
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=01-myfirst.urdf

I get a blank(dark grey) display window named "urdf.vcg" instead of the usual Rviz window. However, running
rosrun rviz rviz

Works as expected. Is it a problem with my installation or does the tutorial need to be updated?

This is similar to this question 
A recent patch by Shaun Edwards adds a Groovy compatible config file.
