A:

I don't have a definite answer for you, but I would say anything that works for a computer should work on the Pioneer 3-DX.
So I would tell you to maybe look into the Microphone suggestions by MobileRobots/Adept, using the Kinect Microphone Array or popular choices for that kind of application on PCs. You can also look into specialized Speech Recognition software, such as CMU Sphinx.
Good luck!
