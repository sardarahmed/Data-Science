Q:

I have to make a SDF from URDF

Dear Gazebo Users,
I need to have a SDF format of the Mobile Robot mp_500 but I'm struggling too much of getting the URDF converted into SDF. Does anyone have any idea how I can convert this file? What is it that i have to change in the URDF file to make it work?
Thank you very much.
E. Raci

Gazebo supports urdf models as well, you don't need to change it into sdf if you don't want to. Do you get any errors when loading the urdf model?

How can i make these models to spawn in Gazebo, is there a special code or something? So far i only know how to spwan models using gazebos Model Database!

As soon as i want to load the UR10 in the Gazebo, i have modified it's URDF from .gazebo/models/ur10 and because i wanted to add a sensor to it, however as soon as i want to load it in gazebo i get an error saying:

A:

Gazebo has a command line too that converts URDF to SDF:
gz sdf -p <URDF>
You can redirect output to a file.
