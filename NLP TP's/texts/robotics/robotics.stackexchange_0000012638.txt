Q:

Electronic speed controllers and total current draw

Do we have to take Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC) into account when calculating the total current draw of the system?
As far as I can understand, the motor and ESC are connected in series, so we take the component that draws the most current, which is the motor in this case. Then, all combinations of a motor and ESC are connected in parallel, thus the currents add up. Am I thinking right? Or am I missing something here?

A:

You are correct. There will be a small amount of current used for the ESC electronics that are not in series with the motor, but that should be negligible.
