Q:

Nodelet multi-threading example

Hi all,
I am finding a way to separate some heavy load process into some standalone threads so that I could get other callbacks in time using nodelet. I looked at the nodelet wiki page but it has few description about its multi-threading model and usage, so I am wondering where I could find such usage examples or projects already doing this?
BTW, is creating my own threads using boost inside a nodelet a bad idea?
Thanks for any help.

The camera1394 nodelet is an example of using multiple threads: source.
