A:

Follow questions
On the top right side of every question, you can see a "Follow" button. Click that to follow the question.

When you ask a question, you automatically follow it.
Followed questions list
Then you can go to your profile and followed questions, and you'll see the list of all your followed questions.

This is the direct link to your list:
