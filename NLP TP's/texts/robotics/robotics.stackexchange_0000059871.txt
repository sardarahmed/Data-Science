Q:

Executing Python NAOqi SDK

I'm trying to figure out how to run ROS on the Nao. I've tried using ROS Hydro and the Nao Python SDK (although had little luck) so I installed ROS Fuerte and am trying to follow the instructions provided by the ROS wiki.
At one point it says to check the installation by executing naoqi:
$ ~/naoqi/naoqi-sdk-1.12.3-linux32/naoqi
This does not work, even when I replace naoqi-sdk-1.12.3-linux32 with my corresponding version (pynaoqi-python-2.7-naoqi-1.14-linux64). My question is: how do I execute naoqi? Is there some command that I should be typing into the command line?
