Q:

Where is this header file?

Hi
I was looking at some code and noticed a header file that doesn't exist in the repo. This line includes a header  "orb_slam2_ros/SaveMap.h", but it's not included in the repo. The package builds completely fine. Is the header generated? If so, how is it generated?
Thanks

A:

orb_slam2_ros/SaveMap is a service, which is defined in appliedAI-Initiative/orb_slam_2_ros/srv/SaveMap.srv.
All ROS service definitions are processed by code generators which -- in the case of C++ -- generate header files for them.
See these lines for where the service is registered and the code generators are invoked.

it's not included in the repo.

as should now be clear: the header file is generated during the build, so is not part of the repository.
