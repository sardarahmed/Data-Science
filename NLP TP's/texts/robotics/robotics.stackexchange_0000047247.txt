Q:

Groovy, Lego EV3

to  Willow Garage/ ROS
I would like to know if Groovy will support lego NXT and I hope in the future Lego EV3, also is supported, as those are a very good initial environment to learn ROS
as such they are not only very flexible  platform to learn but very versatile and and excellent prototyping platform
could you please share with me your views, and thoughts about this
Many Thanks
