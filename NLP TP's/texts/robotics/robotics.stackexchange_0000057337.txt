Q:

rviz seg faults after implementing "PointCloud2 display, and set the topic to /camera/depth/points"

Hi
I get a segmentation fault error and rviz closes whenever I run the openni_launch. The steps I take are

roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
rosrun rviz rviz
Set the Fixed Frame (top left of rviz window) to /camera_depth_optical_frame.
Add a PointCloud2 display, and set the topic to /camera/depth/points

After these steps rviz crashes with a segfault error. Can anyone help? Below are some more info

A:

PointCloud display on rviz/groovy installed from .debs currently seems to be broken (on non-Nvidia GPU machines). I also encountered this issue few days ago and "solved" it by using hydro instead. See this related Q/A and rviz tickets 713 and 717.
