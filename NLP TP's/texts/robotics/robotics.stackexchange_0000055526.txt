Q:

Changing format of debug output

How do I change the format of ROS_INFO/ROS_DEBUG, etc so that it prints out the filename and line number that it was called from?

Thanks! Is there a way to not get the full path to the file?

mmm...  not to my knowledge, sorry; yeah... its too verbose. However, when you write ROS_XXX log macros, you can add a _NAMED suffix specifying who is writing the log messages; not but idea at all in big, complex nodes.
