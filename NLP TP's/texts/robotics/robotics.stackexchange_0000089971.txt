Q:

no module named rospy after anaconda install

Hello all,
I was using ros kinetic with py scipts without problem, but then I tried installing Anaconda 3.5 and all my ROS is messed as you guess. So I uninstalled Anaconda 3.5 and installed Anaconda 2.7.
Now the problem is I cannot run py scripts, as they usually give error like ImportError: no module named 'rospy' and etc..
when I tried
which python

it shows me /usr/bin/python that I believe it is wrong
python --version

shows Python 2.7.12
I tried adding export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-package without comment but it didn't work.
where I am doing wrong? could you help me thank you

A:

Anaconda has probably installed a new version of python and more importantly updated the PYTHONPATH so that it no longer includes the path of the required ROS packages. You should be able to add the necessary path back in by adding a line to your .bashrc file.
Your PYTHONPATH envrionment variable should include a path to /opt/ros/<ros_version>/lib/python2.7/dist-packages, if it doesn't then this may be the cause of your problem. You can check this with the following command:
printenv PYTHONPATH

If you add export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/ros/<ros_version>/lib/python2.7/dist-packages to your bashrc file and re-run it then this should hopefully fix your problem.

Note: sourceing setup.bash should setup PYTHONPATH for you. I'm not sure about Anaconda, but ..

.. manually changing PYTHONPATH through .bashrc should be done with care, and only if/when absolutely necessary.
Not saying it shouldn't be done in this case, just wanted to add a bit of "don't touch this willy-nilly".
