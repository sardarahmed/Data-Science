Q:

catkin_make reports 'invoking "make" fails'

Today I tried to install moveit from source, so far I only used the debians. I am using Ros Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04
When executing catkin_make I got the following error at 73% of the build process:
linking CXX executable /home/wouter/ros/workspace/moveit/devel/lib/moveit_ros_move_group/move_group
[ 73%] Built target move_group
Linking CXX shared library /home/wouter/ros/workspace/moveit/devel/lib/libmoveit_move_group_default_capabilities.so
[ 73%] Built target moveit_move_group_default_capabilities
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make" failed
Do you have any idea why invoking "make" fails?

A:

The error was that some headers of the debian-installed moveit pacakages were selected, whereas the source-installed headers should have been selected. After deleting the debians everything worked fine. Thanks Isucan for your assistance!

Hello I'm in the same situation. Can you or someone else tell me where I can find the debian headers I have to delete? Thanks in advance.

Hi, I've just dealt with the same problem and I can't find neither these debians headers. Could we have more precision please?
