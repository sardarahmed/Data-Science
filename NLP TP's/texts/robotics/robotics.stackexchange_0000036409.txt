Q:

Ardu IMU+ V3 drivers

Hi community,
Has anybody tried to use an Ardu-IMU with ros ?
The new version Ardu-IMU V3 seems to be very interesting and powerful...
Its xmas-time and I like to buy one for my robot :-)
Cheers
Christian

A:

As the ArduIMU is using an atmega328 and arduino IDE for development, it would probably be pretty easy to modify the provided source code to use rosserial_arduino and publish the data over an FTDI cable to a ROS powered computer.

For those that stumble upon this page, rosserial cannot publish a full IMU message due to the hardware buffer length so your best bet is to publish data in a flat array and then republish it in the sensor_msgs/IMU message. :-)
