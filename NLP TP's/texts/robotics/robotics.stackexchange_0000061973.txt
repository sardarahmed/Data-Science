Q:

Can also link yaw rate sensor data with map

I am using gmapping to map the aera with my robot,
I am presently using odo data and data from kinect for mapping.
update after dornhege answer
I get the odo ticks from the robot, which I convert to the distance travelled by each wheel and theta, which I get from the difference of the distances travelled by wheels divided by wheel base length. I give this to /odom.
Presently I am using this published /odom data for the mapping and navigation.
I even Have a yaw rate sensor on the robot which gives yaw angle (along with acceleration values), How can I use this with robot_pose_ekf which also accepts Roll and Pitch angles, but I only have yaw angels how can I achieve the fused odo data with yaw using robot_pose_ekf.?
Many thanks in advance.

You would just set roll and pitch to 0. Yaw angles are the important ones for slam.
Comment by ROSuser007 on 2020-01-23:
Warning: A yaw rate sensor's output is not an angle [rad] or [°], it is an angular velocity [rad/s] or [°/s].
P.S: I am aware the question is more than 5 (five) years old, but it can still be found and probably continues to confuse people.

A:

The cmmon way is to filter odometry with yaw, e.g. by robot_pose_ekf and use this as odometry for gmapping.
