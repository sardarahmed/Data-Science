Q:

OSX Install problem - rqt_top: No definition of [python-psutil] for OS [osx]

Hello! I'm trying to walk through the latest OSX install instructions. I have gotten to this step:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
When I encountered this error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rqt_top: No definition of [python-psutil] for OS [osx]
I'm on 10.8.3 and this is the first time I've tried to install ROS on this laptop. (If that matters)
Suggestions for debugging ideas would be appreciated!

A:

Update 9/23/2013) patch is accepted and the reported issue should not longer be the case.

That's because psutil is missing in OSX' rosdep key.

Here is tentative workaround before the rosdep key gets updated. Since this involves modifying protected area, do it at your own risk.
I have a patch that I haven't submitted since I haven't tested on my local Mac. If you can try (eg. by doing the following steps) that would be great.
Make a backup and modify /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list as follows:
Current: yaml https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/osx-homebrew.yaml osx
New: yaml https://github.com/130s/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/osx-homebrew.yaml osx

then run (adjust ROS distro accordingly):
$ rosdep update
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y

which should install psutil via pip.
Be sure to roll back the same file once you've done above.

I ran into the same problem - I tried your suggestion but after trying
rosdep install rqt_top
I get the following error
rosdep install rqt_top
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource rqt_top

Sorry, there was a couple of problems with my initial description. I've corrected my post. This worked fine for me so that I've submitted a patch to include psutil into the official rosdep key https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/2187
