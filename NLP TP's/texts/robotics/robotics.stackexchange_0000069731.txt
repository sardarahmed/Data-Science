Q:

Building rqt (plus all plugins) from source - qt_gui_main() can't find any plugins

Hi!
I have just finished building rqt from source for ROS Indigo on my Debian Jessie without any errors. However when I try to run rqt_graph for example I get:
qt_gui_main() found no plugin matching "rqt_graph.ros_graph.RosGraph"

Next thing I did was to open rqt. It opens fine however I can't see a single plugin inside the plugin menu even though I have rqt_graph, rqt_console etc. (full rqt_common_plugins metapackage was installed). The executables are there (that is why the terminal didn't throw an error at me that the command was not found when calling rqt_graph) but there seems to be missing something and I don't know what.
Any ideas what's going on here? All the source war pulled via wstool and rosdep (as described in the tutorial about installing ROS on Debian).
EDIT: Running rqt --list-plugins doesn't return anything at all.

Already answered here. It seems that source-ing my ~/.bashrc is not enough and I have to delete ~/.config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini too. Now every thing is working the way it should be. ^_^
