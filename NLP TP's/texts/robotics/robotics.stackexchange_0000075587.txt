Q:

ROS for Aerial Robotics

Hey Folks,
I am newbie at ROS, I had installed Jade version on Ubuntu15.04 vivid. I follow up the wiki, but Indeed it doesn't make sense for me uptill now. Please any good tutorials for the application of ROS for aerial robotics. Also I need to know the main features of ROS. I have to confess that I don't so much about the benefit of using ROS on Linux, rather than fast what others pros?
Best,
Marwa ElDiwiny

A:

What do you mean by aerial robotics? There is mavros for interfacing with Pixhawk/PX4/APM flight modules if that's what you are looking for.
I've only used ROS on Linux because that is the OS it is native to. I've heard that it is less stable on other platforms but I've never tested that.
