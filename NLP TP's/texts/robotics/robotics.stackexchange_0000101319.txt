Q:

MoveIt setup assistant not loading meshes; unable to find package name within the ROS workspace

Hello everyone!
I have exported a hand SolidWorks assembly file into a URDF using a the sw_urdf SolidWorks addon. I have defined the joint tree and wanted to move onto setting it up fully using MoveIt setup assistant.
When I tried loading the file into it I have received the following error:

ROS was unable to find the package name hand within the ROS workspace. This may cause issues later.

This is strange as I have followed this guide when importing the generated URDF into my ROS workspace and it involved generating a package.
After I click OK to carry on and load the URDF into the setup assistant I get the following errors for every link I have (the example provided is a sample):

[rospack] Error: package 'hand.urdf' not found
[librospack]: error while executing command
[ERROR] [1646655128.321427916]: Could not load resource [package://hand.urdf/meshes/palm.STL]: Unable to open file "package://hand.urdf/meshes/palm.STL".

It seems that because MoveIt did not spot the package directory it couldn't find the meshes directory. I am unsure how to resolve this issue as I did setup a ROS package using catkin_create_pkg command.
I will be very grateful if someone could guide me regarding this problem.

A:

Before opening the moveit assistance, you must source the workspace where your robot's description package is located.
Something like you have ~/catkin_ws/src/my_robot_description
then,
to build your pkg, you can use catkin_make or catkin build.
after building the package, you must source devel/setup.bash before launching the moveit setup assistance from the same sourced terminal.

In the end I just had to add the custom hand package to the MoveIt workspace. It's not as neat as I was hoping for since I wanted to apply MoveIt to multiple workspaces. Unfortunately I had to rebuild the whole of the MoveIt workspace. Maybe I'm missing something, but I just wasn't able to source two workspaces.
