Hi All,
How could we make rviz subscribe to a topic of arm_navigation_msgs::DisplayTrajectory ?
I am using fuerte.
Thank you.

A:

You need to use the "Planning" display ("Add" -> "New Display" -> "Motion Planning" -> "Planning"). The description says it takes motion_planning_msgs::KinematicPath, but that's not true any more; it really takes arm_navigation_msgs::DisplayTrajectory messages´. I filed a ticket on that.
(Update: the "Planning" display is loaded via the motion planning RViz plugin, so you need to resolve your other problem first.)
