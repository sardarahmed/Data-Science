Q:

Possible to declare static object in urdf file?

Hi,
I have a bunch of objects as urdf files which I use for simulation in Gazebo and visualization in Rviz. Now I would like some of them to be fixed in the environment. As stated here this is possible with Gazebo xml model files by putting following tag in the model.
<static>true</static>

However, simply putting the same tag in the gazebo extension of the urdf file like so:
<gazebo reference="my_object">
  <static>true</static>
</gazebo>

does not work, it simply gets ignored. I would like to use urdf files instead of Gazebo model xml's since urdf's can be easily visualized in Rviz by reading the description from the parameter server which does not seem to work for Gazebo model xml's. So, the question is whether there is a way to literally fix objects in their urdf file description opposed to simply making them very heavy.
Thanks,
-Robert-

A:

just add extension without the reference attribute to your model:
<gazebo>
    <static>true</static>
</gazebo>

Perfect, thank you!

Is it possible to make only a specific link static?  I want only the base_link of my robot arm to be static (i.e. welded in place) while other links and joints can be actuated.

@Rufus, did you ever find a solution to this question? I am having the same issue.
Comment by Rufus on 2020-05-15:
@matthewmarkey My conclusion was that I don't believe it is possible.  The only way to achieve something similar is to explicitly specify in the urdf file a fixed joint between the world and the base_link
 <link name="world" />

 <joint name="world_joint" type="fixed">
    <parent link="world" />
    <child link = "base_link" />
    <origin xyz="0.0 0.0 0.1" rpy="0.0 0.0 0.0" />
 </joint>

I think it's unfortunate that changing where to spawn the arm (base link) requires changing the urdf.  I would hope this can be done similar to spawning static objects in gazebo, just changing some parameters in the launch file.

Ok thank you @Rufus. When you change this in the URDF, should you also run the MSA again now that you have changed the URDF?

@matthewmarkey what is MSA??

The Moveit Setup Assistant.
Comment by Rufus on 2020-05-20:
I've never used Moveit Setup Assistant before so I'm not sure

Ok, thank you. I am unsure of what I am doing wrong, but I am using your method above with no success. Is it possible for you to check out my URDF and SRDF? I would really appreciate it...URDF and SRDF.
Comment by Rufus on 2020-05-21:
I can't tell by the looks of it what's wrong (I'm also no expert in urdf and srdf).  If you could describe what's wrong, that would be useful.  Is the whole arm frozen (i.e. joints cannot be actuated)?  Is the whole arm not fixed (i.e. the whole arm including the base flails around)?

Also you might want to edit the .xacro file instead of the .urdf file if the .xacro file is used to generate and overwrite the .urdf file
Comment by matthewmarkey on 2020-05-21:
I am using the URDF for generation.
This is the output if I am using the "world" link tag as shown in the above URDF.
I have been getting some advice from someone on reddit and they suggested that the joint_states could be receiving states from multiple sources but I am unsure of how to verify this.
