Q:

Is it possible to use kvaser (can to USB) to read canopen device?

I have a SICK encoder which works with CANOPEN protocol and also I have a KVASER leaf light v2 CAN to USB interface. So my question is if there is a way to use KVASER to read CANOPEN device? Maybe with ROS_CANOPEN package?

A:

Yes, ros_canopen utilizes SocketCAN package and many Kvaser CAN interfaces, such as Leaf Light v2, are supported by SocketCAN.
To install SocketCAN drivers for Kvaser hardware:

Make sure you uninstalled linuxcan (CANlib), since Kvaser drivers blacklist SocketCAN modules:

$ cd linuxcan
- $ sudo make uninstall

Find your interface

ip a

Now you should see your Kvaser device listed, e.g.
- 3: can0: <NOARP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 10
link/can
For the rest, I suggest you to consult

@speloot, yup I found the answer pretty look like yours few days ago, was too busy to update here. After what you said, there is a configuration progress for ros canopen_chain_node after catching CAN data by ros socketcan_bridge.
