Q:

trying to save a turtlebot map with android

I am having issues with the two android_make_a_map.launch and android_map_nav.launch
When trying to save the map from make_a_map.launch I get the following error on my android.
"naming map couldn't even start: no such service save_map of type map_store/savemap"
When I try to run android_map_nav.launch it fails and hangs on trying to open. app launch failed.
