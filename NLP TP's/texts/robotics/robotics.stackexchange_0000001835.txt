Q:

Effective motor type for robotic arm?

I am trying to build an arm that will have about 5 by 5 by maybe 7 or so centimeters of room for a rotary motor capable of lifting it. The joint will basically allow the arm to rotate in a single degree of freedom in a circle that is perpendicular to the ground.The rest of the arm will probably be around 64 centimeters long and weigh around a minimum of 9 kilograms before it lifts anything. 
What kind of motor type would give it the best chance of lifting the arm quickly† and reasonably accurately‡? 
† Raising from straight down to out 90 degrees in around 1 to .5 seconds maximum.
‡ At least a centimeter at the end of the arm which means probably at the very least 300 positions for the motor.

A:

So you want to lift 9kg of mass, which means a force of around 90N, that's on an arm that's 64cm long, in one second.
$\frac{\left(90N\right)\left(0.64m\right)}{1s}\simeq58W$
So, that's probably doable.
You don't say anything at all about gearing -- how do you propose to take the high-speed, low-torque power that comes from most motors and turn it into the low-speed, high-torque (or high-force) power that you need for the arm?  Do you have space allocated for that, or were you planning on attaching your motor output directly to the arm?
