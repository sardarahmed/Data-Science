Q:

gazebo pioneer simulation = real robot behaviour?

Hi,
I want to run some experiments on pioneer 3dx. Before porting on real bot, I want to run these in simulation environment. P2os stack do provide urdf model and an interface with gazebo. I can tele-operate this model with erratic_teleop package. Is it correct to say that real robot will have similar behaviour to robot model?
Can I use stage in conjuction with gazebo so that path planning can be done using maps in stage and execution of happen as with robot model?

A:

AFAIK, gazebo works on ODE & Ogre graphics engines and stage works on FLTK & OpenGL libraries.Further, gazebo models are made using xml scripts and stage models are world files. Hence, I do not think that gazebo and stage can be made work in tandem - they are rather different philosophies !

Ok, I got this, but what about p2os behaviour?
Comment by Arkapravo on 2012-03-18:
@prince The real robot should have nearly the same behaviour as shown in simulations (depends on the correctness of the model, mechatronic functioning etc) however you have rolled up 2 questions into one - if I were you, I would have asked this as 2 separate questions.
