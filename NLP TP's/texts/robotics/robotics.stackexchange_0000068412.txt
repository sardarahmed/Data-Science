Q:

Call service from outside of ROS

Hey guys,
I have a programm, that is supposed to work in a ROS environment.
This programm has been written in a multi-platform framework and will most likely be run on a mobile OS, but should be OS-independent after all.
It should be able to send messages to a ROS service and receive messages from that service.
I wanted to ask how that could be achieved since there is no ROS environment set up on the app itself.
I would need some kind of wrapper that sends stuff that looks like propper messages on ROS. I couln't find anything but maybe there is already a framework or you could point me to do it and where I should start.

I found what I was searching for with rosbridge. It allows to send out json messages via UDP proxy to access ROS functionality: http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite
