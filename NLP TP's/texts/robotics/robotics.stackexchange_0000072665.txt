Q:

How to use a terminal command line in a launch file

I am currently using Hector mapping with a hokuyo laser scanner.
In the launch file of Hector mapping, I added the hokuyo_node for the laserscanner and I also start RVIZ.
But I still need to configure the hokuyo lasserscanner everytime manually in the terminal with this code before starting:
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
Is there a way to include this in my launch file?
Thank you!

A:

I'm pretty sure roslaunch can't handle this because it's simply XML tags (please correct me if I'm wrong) but you should definitely look into setting udev rules for your laser scanner. This means that whenever it's plugged in, the computer will automatically give it proper permissions.
