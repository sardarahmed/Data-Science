Q:

How to list available loggers?

I'm using a rosconsole.config file and the ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE environment variable to specify where it is, but is there any way to get a list of available loggers without having to run rqt_logger_level?
Thanks.

A:

I know you want a solution without rqt_logger_level. Although I still refer to it, this answer doesn't depend on it.
Get a list of node names by rosnode list. Then, as in rqt_logger_level.LoggerLevelServiceCaller.send_logger_change_message, you can iteratively call rosservice.get_service_class_by_name to get a corresponding service to the given node name.
HTH.

That looks great, thanks. The larger fix is probably to develop a curses-based rosconsole clientâ€”especially one capable of prepopulating from the roslaunch-logs dir and spitting out a rosconsole.config file which you can then point to from the ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE env var.
