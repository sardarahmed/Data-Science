Q:

missing libv4l2.h file during compilation

Hi
I'm trying to compile a package on an odroid but get the error that I'm missing libv4l2.h that is a dependency for the camera driver package I'm installing (http://wiki.ros.org/uvc_camera). I have already installed and tested the package on my desktop computer, but my cameras will be connected to the Odroid.
I have installed the v4l2 using the
sudo apt-get install v4l-utils

command. I thought this would install all the files and headers I needed but apparently not. I can't remember to have done anything else on my desktop to get it working. Anyone have any tips on this? I think there are some other .h files missing as well, but I don't think the compiler picked them up as the compilation was terminated due to this error
Here is the error I receive
In file included from /root/catkin_ws/src/camera_umd/uvc_camera/src/stereo.cpp:6:0:/root/catkin_ws/src/camera_umd/uvc_camera/include/uvc_cam/uvc_cam.h:26:21: fatal error: libv4l2.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated.

A:

Figured it out
I had to install the following
apt-get install libv4l-dev

What process did you use to setup your build environment? If rosdep didn't install those dependencies then something would seem to be incorrectly setup on the uvc_camera side.

I used catkin build if that is what you mean. Didn't use rosdep prior to that. Maybe that would have fixed it automatically?

Yes. Just cloning a repository is not enough. See #q252478 for the general procedure (adapt pkg and ROS version names).

Thank you! I've just been fiddeling blindly around until it works :D This will make things easier!
