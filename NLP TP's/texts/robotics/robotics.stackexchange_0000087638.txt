Q:

how to edit the map (.pbm) built by gmapping pkg

Hello All,
I need to edit the map that built by gmapping pkg. Is there any software that supports this format? almost all software open this format but they don't save changes under this format? Do you have any suggestion?

GIMP can export PGM files. I assume you meant PGM and not PBM.
