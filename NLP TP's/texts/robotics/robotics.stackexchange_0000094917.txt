Q:

[autoware.auto] cannot launch LGSVL simulator

I am following the instructions here:
https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/lgsvl.html
And I run the simulator binary I get the window with the 'Open Browser' button, but when I click the button, nothing happens. It seems very similar to this problem:
https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/issues/319
But I'm not sure how to apply that resolution to a docker container. Can anyone help me figure out what's going on?

What happens if you manually open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080?

It redirects to a login page on https://account.lgsvlsimulator.com/

A:

The button may not work correctly within Docker. However, you can open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. The new behavior is that this will redirect to https://account.lgsvlsimulator.com/. You will need to create a login for this site if you have not already using the "Sign Up" link at the top of the page. Once you've created this account, you can log in and configure the simulator as before.

Thanks, that seems to do it.
