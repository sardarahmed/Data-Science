We need to see the dependencies section of you package.xml, please.

hi sorry for these days late i have an problem , now i run catkin_make after a few days in root catkin and i receive this result , i edited my last question
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-07:
i dont know is it true or not?
Comment by Akif on 2015-12-08:
@fatima, did you get any errors when you remove nodelet dependency from your CMakeLists.txt as @joq suggested?
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-08:
hi akif, no after a few days when i run catkin_make again i hadnt any error without nodelet error i was surprised i edited my answer and put the result above but yet i have the same problem i couldnt run $ rosrun beginner_tutorials talker so i dont know is the catkin_make run true or not!!!!
Comment by Akif on 2015-12-08:
@fatima, in your question it is written that the package name is beginner2_tutorials not beginner_tutorials as you try. Can you check it?
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-08:
yes i did that and my result is :
fatima@fatima-K55VD:~/catkin_ws1$ rosrun beginner2_tutorials talker
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/fatima/catkin_ws1/src/beginner2_tutorials

Comment by fatima on 2015-12-08:
i ask new question at link so thank you so much for your help

A:

Why did you list nodelet as a CATKIN_DEPENDS in your CMakeLists.txt?
The tutorial does not do that. Try removing it.
Maybe you should start over, copying from the tutorial exactly.
