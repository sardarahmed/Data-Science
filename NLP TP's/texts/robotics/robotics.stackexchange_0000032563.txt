Q:

PR2 controller joint: control 2 joints with one motor

In our robotics hand, I have to control 2 joints with one motor: the distal and middle joints are mecanically linked together, so you issue a command to a "super joint" which moves both of them (let's call this joint J0).
We have one sensor in each joint (J1 and J2): we add both joint calibrated values to compute the J0 position. It's not possible to move those joints individually.
For the time being my model only contains the "normal" joints (J1 and J2). The problem I have is that the J0 is then not defined, so it's not possible to control it.
What would be the best way to solve my problem?
I was thinking about adding a "dummy" joint J0 in the model (with really small links, so it's not visible / doesn't add collision where it shouldn't), but I guess there must be a better way of doing that. Any help greatly appreciated!
Cheers,

A:

take wrist transmission for example, in propagatePosition, you should update all joint values by writing them back into your joint state js[] vector.
