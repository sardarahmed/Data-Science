A:

What did you expect would happen?
catkin_make install does just what it says: it makes (builds) things first,then installs them into the default location (which is /path/to/catkin_ws/install).
If you then do source /path/to/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash, your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set to include locations under /path/to/catkin_ws/install, so a roscd PKG will take you there, instead of devel/.

For some more info, see catkin/workspaces on the ROS wiki. I think especially the Catkin Workspaces section should be helpful.
