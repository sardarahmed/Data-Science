Q:

Fuerte - kdl_conversions package missing

I recently downloaded the latest arm_navigation (from https://kforge.ros.org/armnavigation/armnavigation) for my recent Fuerte install. However when I attempt to build the arm_kinematics_constraint_aware package, I get the following error.

arm_navigation/arm_kinematics_constraint_aware/src/kdl_arm_kinematics_plugin.cpp:35:37: fatal error: kdl_conversions/kdl_msg.h: No such file or directory

I double checked and there is indeed no kdl_conversions package in my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (let alone in geometry, where I expected it to be).
So I downloaded the geometry package (from hg https://kforge.ros.org/geometry/geometry) and make the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH reference it instead. However, I can't build it because it uses catkin (I tried to go through the tutorials, but I couldn't get it to work). Is there any way to get a regular version of geometry that uses rosmake for Fuerte? Or some way to get arm_navigation working without kdl_conversions?

I also ran

sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-arm-navigation --fix-missing

for the heck of it, but it didn't fix my problem.

Why do you want the latest version of arm navigation?
Comment by jker on 2012-09-25:
The arm_navigation package I was using was from electric, I wanted one compatible with Fuerte after I upgraded.

'sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-arm-navigation' will get you the latest version of arm_navigation that was released for fuerte.

A:

On the change list for arm_navigation, the 1.2.x releases are compiled against ROS Groovy, which has significant changes to the build infrastructure and some core packages, including geometry.
Looking at the change logs, I don't see any new features since 1.1.11, so I would just use the version available from debs.
There is no non-catkin version of the geometry package available for Fuerte. Catkin doesn't support multiple install directories, so it isn't possible to do an overlay of geometry in the same way that you can overlay older ROS stacks; this is one of the things that will be fixed with the build system updates in Groovy.

How would one install an older version of the package? The wiki page for it only gives the link I tried above.
Comment by ahendrix on 2012-09-25:
You can get an older version of the source by checking out the release tag; 'hg update '; for the latest version from Fuerte, you can update to the fuerte tag: 'hg update fuerte' or you can update to the released version tag 'hg update arm_navigation-1.1.11'

In general, check the releases page of a stack to see which versions you should use for which distribution: http://ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation/Releases
