A:

Is this related to #q263576? If so, then please tell us what you ended up doing: are you still using the Hydro version of everything? Which tutorial(s) did you follow to set everything up?
From your description it could be that you haven't correctly copied everything (ie: the rapid files) onto the controller.

Yes, the hydro version is used. This is the link to the hydro version. I created a ROS folder and place those 6 files into it and copy it into ABB IRC5 controller pendant home folder. Then I did the Load Modules to Tasks.

Can you verify that the Automatic Loading of Modules listing shows everything as described in the tutorial? I've seen controllers that looked like they were correctly configured, but upon closer inspection weren't.

let me check. Check the name and spelling you meant?
