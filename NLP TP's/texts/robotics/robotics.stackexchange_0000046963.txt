Q:

RViz segfaults when adding second display plugin

On a freshly installed Groovy RViz (with default config) generates numerous duplicating warnings during the start:
[ INFO] [1357462354.607319704]: pluginlib WARNING: PLUGINLIB_DECLARE_CLASS is deprecated, please use PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS instead. You can run the script 'plugin_macro_update' provided with pluginlib in your package source folder to automatically and recursively update legacy macros.
And then when I try to add any two displays from the following list: Camera, Image or DepthCloud (I didn't try many of other available though) RViz segfaults with the error in system log:
rviz[8091] general protection ip:7fb48e2571be sp:7fffbd57fea0 error:0 in libclass_loader.so[7fb48e226000+4a000]
Same happens when I try to delete one of the listed above displays.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Boris

UPDATE: Opened a ticket for segfault problem.
Regarding the PLUGIN_DECLARE_CLASS. It seems to be related to segfault, but I didn't realize that before changing default log level to DEBUG. Here what happens from RViz perspective.
So, should I still open a separate ticket or add new info to the previous one?

Thanks for the fix! Side question though -- when the changes usually pushed to main repository from ros-shadow-fixed?

Did not see this...it varies but usually we go through a build cycle in less than 24 hours.. Usually when I release code by early evening the turnover is completed by morning. You can see the status on jenkins.willowgarage.com:8080...when all packages have completed building, they are then synced to

...shadow-fixed. There is a period of time after all packages have built on jenkins to the time they are synced on shadow-fixed. In other words, just because all packages are built on jenkins doesn't mean that you can do a sudo apt-get update/upgrade right away. If packages fail to build on jenkins

...the sync does not happen.
