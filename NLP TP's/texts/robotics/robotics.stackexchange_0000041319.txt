Q:

Rosbag doesn't record cmd_vel on remote master

I'm running Electric on Natty and have the following peculiar issue.
When I run rosbag -a on the above host, the bag output records cmd_vel. However, when I collect rosbag output after setting ROS_MASTER_URI to a different host (which runs diamondback on Lucid), I don't get cmd_vel recorded. Even

shell> rosbag record cmd_vel -a

fails to record cmd_vel in such a case, although all other topics are logged. Note that cmd_vel is being published always.
What could be the problem?
 Updated after Lorenzo's answer  rostopic echo /cmd_vel gives the right output in such a case.

Probably not the cause, but mixing Electric and Diamondback in a single ROS graph is a bad idea and not supported.

A:

This looks like a network problem to me. To prove, check if rostopic echo /cmd_vel also doesn't work. Have a look at this page for more information on debugging network issues.
Edit: Also try rosbag record cmd_vel instead of rosbag record -a to make sure that it hasn't something to do with the -a flag.
