Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: tf view_frames

Hello
I was just wondering if anyone knows a way to generate a formated pdf from
rosrun tf view_frames
I want to include the frames.pdf that is generated in a report by it is very very wide.
Can I do something to get a more vertically oriented graph, that fits into an A4 or letter?
Thanks
Miguel

A:

EDIT: If there are only a couple of figures, an easy solution is to modify the frames.gv file that gets generated when you run rosrun tf view_frames. You can modify this file to best represent the graph. The corresponding graph can then be generated using the dot command:
dot -Tpdf frames.gv -o frames.pdf

Other possible solutions:

If you want this to be done automatically, then it is a fairly difficult problem. It is easy to generate the dot file from the tf tree, but extra work needs to be done reason about the layout. You will have to figure out a way to get the tree from TransformListener and generate a dot file appropriately with some layout information. See how the current dot file is generated here.

Modify the graph in an SVG editor. I personally have never used one of these, so I cannot comment on it.

Isn't the dot file already output (frames.gv)?

Excellent point. I have updated the answer based on this information. I think I have never bothered to open that file before.
