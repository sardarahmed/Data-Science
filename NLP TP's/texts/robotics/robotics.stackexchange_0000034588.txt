Q:

Problem integrating ROS with Eclipse Indigo

Hi,
I've tried to integrate ROS with eclipse following this link. According to step no.2, I had to run "make eclipse-project" in my package directory, however, i got an error "make: *** No rule to make target `eclipse-project'.  Stop."
What could be the problem? Thanks in advance.

A:

Are you trying to integrate rosjava code or roscpp code?
The instructions for rosjava (in progress) are here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava/Build/Eclipse
For roscpp, your project needs to follow the standard package template, where the Makefile looks like:
 include $(shell rospack find mk)/cmake.mk

And nothing more (i.e. the rest of your bulid is configured via CMake).  The above cmake.mk file declares the eclipse-project target.
If you don't wish to use the cmake.mk file, then you can grab the necessary Makefile rule from mk/cmake.mk and adapt it to your needs.

@kwc: Thanks a lot anyway..

Most ROS packages use the include and then do all the build configuration in CMake.

Yeah, that works by using that include..By the way, which way is the best practice between those two?
Comment by kwc on 2011-09-29:
Yes, but if you do that include, your Makefile cannot contain anything else -- it is a wrapper for invoking into CMake.  So, an alternative is to copy the 'eclipse-project' target out of cmake.mk instead, and put that directly into your Makefile.

I didn't get you. Did you mean I have to include "include $(shell rospack find mk)/cmake.mk" in Makefile? As far as I know, it is not recommended to alter  the Makefile, to alter CMakeList.txt makes sense.

roscpp, not rosjava.
