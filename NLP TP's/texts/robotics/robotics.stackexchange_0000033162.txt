Q:

Transforming odom to base-link and then to map

For a robotic application, I get odometry on /odom. However, I don't have a robot state publisher, so I'm publishing my own transforms. I want to know whether they are right:

odom->base_link: identity transform

map->base_link: When tf starts, I note the pose given by odometry. Then as the robot moves to a new position, I take the new odometry readings and compute the new pose. The values in new_pose-old_pose are broadcast.
