Q:

When I try to "catkin build" I get error messages

I am using Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit.V-REP 3.5.0 64 bit.ROS Kinetic desktop full, joystick and brics actuator packages. When I try to "catkin build" under my ROS ws I receive following error messages. How can I sort them out?
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "joy" with any of
  the following names:

    joyConfig.cmake
    joy-config.cmake

 Add the installation prefix of "joy" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set...

You're not showing actual errors, just the summary output of catkin_tools that tells us something failed to compile.
Comment by acikbasm on 2019-02-17:
Maybe expression was not good enough but anyway at some further step at my processes I needed them have installed all correctly. To re-ask the question in another way; how to complete that compilation then?

I think above message is the error message.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-02-18:
It would appear you have not installed all dependencies prior to starting the build.
Please refer to #q252478 for the general workflow when attempting to build pkgs from sources.

A:

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joy should solve your problem and then source your workspace again.

when I do it I get another set of error messages as below...
E: Encountered a section with no Package: header
E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/packages.ros.org_ros_ubuntu_dists_xenial_main_binary-amd64_Packages
Comment by kosmastsk on 2019-02-18:
Try to remove the existing Merge List with sudo rm -vf /var/lib/apt/lists/* and then create a new one with sudo apt-get update
source

Thanks that worked well. Now only 1 minor issue the rest of the installation was completed...
Comment by kosmastsk on 2019-02-18:
You can mark this question as solved and open a new question, if needed, for your installation ;)

Now I have one remaining issue apart from that in case you know;
I try to run a robot simulation in V-rep at ubuntu 16.04. First I type roscore, then I initialize V-rep, and then I open a simple simulation code which is in *.ttt file. Afterall, I type command "roslaunch vrep_apps base.launch" but...
Comment by acikbasm on 2019-02-18:
I get another error message:
[base.launch] is neither a launch file in package [vrep_apps] nor is [vrep_apps] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file.

Any idea about this issue?
