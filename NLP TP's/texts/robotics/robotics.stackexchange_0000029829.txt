Q:

Ogre_tools installation issues on Snow Leopard (with ROS diamondback)

Hi,
I am trying to build ogre_tools using the source present in ROS Diamondback on a 64bit Mac SnowLeopard. I have successfully installed Ogre (after fetching the latest version from their repo) and have placed the Ogre.framework where the ogre_tools build process looks for it. However, I am stuck with this error now,
..... Some output from the make command....
make -f CMakeFiles/python_ogre_tools.dir/build.make CMakeFiles/python_ogre_tools.dir/depend
/opt/local/bin/cmake -E cmake_progress_report /Users/sagnikdhar/ros/visualization_common/ogre_tools/CMakeFiles 20

Any idea what is going wrong ?
I found a discussion thread which discusses a similar problem, however the solution points to a ticket (Ticket ID 818) on the WillowGarage site, but the link seems broken. Any idea how I could track an older ticket on the Willow Garage site ?
Thanks a lot !

Hi,
Thanks for the link to the ticket. However it does not solve my problem completely. From what I understand, ogre_tools_swig_generated.cpp is generated from ogre_tools.py by using swig. But this is failing. When I try to execute the command manually, this is the error that I get ,
"Unable to open file ../lib/ogre_tools.py: No such file or directory"
Does anyone know what could possibly be going wrong ?
Thanks,
Sagnik

We faced a bunch of other issues on using ROS on a mac and decided to move to Ubuntu. So I haven't had a chance to verify if this problem has been fixed.

Is this still an issue? How have things progressed?
