Q:

State estimation of mobile robot

For a mobile robot - four wheels, front wheel steering - I use the following (bicycle) prediction model to estimate its state based on accurate radar measurements only. No odometry or any other input information $u_k$ is available from the mobile robot itself.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
      x_{k+1} \\
      y_{k+1} \\
      \theta_{k+1} \\
      v_{k+1} \\
      a_{k+1} \\
      \kappa_{k+1} \\
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    f_k(\vec{x}_k,u_k,\vec{\omega}_k,\Delta t) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x_k + v_k \Delta t \cos \theta_k \\
      y_k + v_k \Delta t \sin \theta_k \\
      \theta_k + v_k \kappa_k \Delta t \\
      v_k + a_k \Delta t \\
      a_k \\
      \kappa_k + \frac{a_{y,k}}{v_{x,k}^2}
    \end{bmatrix}
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \omega_x \\
      \omega_y \\
      \omega_{\theta} \\
      \omega_v \\
      \omega_a \\
      \omega_{\kappa}
 \end{bmatrix}
$$
where $x$ and $y$ are the position, $\theta$ is the heading and $v$, $a$ are the velocity and acceleration respectively. Vector $\vec{\omega}$ is zero mean white gaussian noise and $\Delta t$ is sampling time. These mentioned state variables $\begin{bmatrix} x & y & \theta & v & a \end{bmatrix}$ are all measured although $\begin{bmatrix} \theta & v & a \end{bmatrix}$ have high variance. The only state that is not measured is curvature $\kappa$. Therfore it is computed using the measured states $\begin{bmatrix} a_{y,k} & v_{x,k}^2\end{bmatrix}$ which are the lateral acceleration and the longitudinal velocity. 
My Question: 
Is there a better way on predicting heading $\theta$, velocity $v$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $\kappa$?

Is it enough for $a_{k+1}$ to just assume gaussian noise $\omega_a$ and use the previous best estimate $a_k$ or is there an alternative?
For curvature $\kappa$ I also thought of using yaw rate $\dot{\theta}$ as $\kappa = \frac{\dot{\theta}}{v_x}$ but then I would have to estimate the yaw rate too.

To make my nonlinear filter model complete here is the measurement model:
$$
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:bicycle-model-leader-vehicle-h}
   y_k = h_k(x_k,k) + v_k =
   \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
     x_k \\
     y_k \\
     \theta_k \\
     v_k \\
     a_k \\
     \kappa_k \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   +
   \begin{bmatrix}
     v_x \\
     v_y \\
     v_{\theta} \\
     v_v \\
     v_a \\
   \end{bmatrix}
 \end{equation}
$$

More Info on the available data:
The measured state vector is already obtained/estimated using a kalman filter. What I want to achive is a smooth trajectory with the estimate $\kappa$. For this it is a requirement to use another Kalman filter or a moving horizon estimation approach.

A:

My solution is to use the following model with disturbance only at acceleration and curvature.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
      x_{k+1} \\
      y_{k+1} \\
      \theta_{k+1} \\
      v_{k+1} \\
      a_{k+1} \\
      \kappa_{k+1} \\
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    f_k(\vec{x}_k,u_k,\vec{\omega}_k,\Delta t) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x_k + v_k \Delta t \cos \theta_k \\
      y_k + v_k \Delta t \sin \theta_k \\
      \theta_k + v_k \kappa_k \Delta t \\
      v_k + a_k \Delta t \\
      a_k + \omega_a \\
      \kappa_k + \omega_{\kappa}
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
