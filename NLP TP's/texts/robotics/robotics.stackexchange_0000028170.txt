Q:

mesh not loading Intermediate Tutorial, Model Appearance

I am following this tutorial from the official Gazebo web page.
In the Step 3: Importing meshes. It is not working, it doesn't load anything into Gazebo. This is my code:
   <visual name="top_visual">
       <pose>0 0 -0.0376785 0 0 1.5707</pose>
      <geometry>
        <mesh>
          <uri>model://velodyne_hdl32/meshes/velodyne_top.dae</uri>
        </mesh>
      </geometry>
   </visual>

I have checked and I have all the files on the correct path. I only modified the velodyne_top visual, and this is what happends:

EDIT 1:

What's the output from the console when running gazebo --verbose and inserting the model?

Done. I have writed it in the post.

A:

Mesh was loading correctly, you can actually see this by putting your mesh in a collsion and then viewing the collisions, but wasn't being displayed. I have opened a different thread --> click me <--
