A:

I got it working and prepared an example on github
Using Eclipse Cyclone DDS, but one has to set some variables
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file:///$(pwd)/cyclonedds.xml 

and the cyclonedds.xml  looks like:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<CycloneDDS xmlns="https://cdds.io/config" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://cdds.io/config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/master/etc/cyclonedds.xsd">

            </Interfaces>

            </Peers>
