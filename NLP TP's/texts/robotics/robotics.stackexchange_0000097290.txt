Q:

Unable to connect Autoware.auto and LGSVL with ROS2 native

Hello everyone, I am trying to run LGSVL alongside autoware.auto but I am totally unable to make anything work. I am following thoses tutorials :
https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/lgsvl.html

In the tutorial it is said to download the latest assets and setup the bridge as ROS2 native. But when starting the simulation with ROS2 native the simulator crashes with this error message in the command line : Aborted (core dumped)
And this error message in the web UI :
Invalid: type_support is null, at /tmp/binarydeb/ros-dashing-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp-0.5.1/src/rmw_node.cpp:1311, at /tmp/binarydeb/ros-dashing-rcl-0.7.9/src/rcl/publisher.c:171

Any idea ? Thanks !

A:

This happens when you have not sourced the Autoware workspace first. Please make sure you run
ade$ source /opt/AutowareAuto/setup.bash

in a terminal before staring LGSVL in the same terminal.

Thanks ! It works indeed !
What is the reason to use ROS2 Native instead of the classical ROS2 bridge ?

Did you run into any difficulties with the ROS2 bridge ?
No ROS2 bridge was available when you started ?

Thanks !

@Mackou The primary reason was that we were seeing very high CPU usage and dropped messages through the websockets-based bridge.
