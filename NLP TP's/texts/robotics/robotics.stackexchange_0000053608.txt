Q:

Get cone from occupancy grid

Hello everyone,
Is there any built in method to get the range data in a cone-format from a nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid message?
I am using the Octomap package with the octomap_server on Groovy, with Python.

A:

I do not think that this exists. And with no response it likely isn't available as you describe.
