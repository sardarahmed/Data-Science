Q:

‘make_shared’ is not a member of ‘boost’

Hi All,
Having a problem with upgrading to Electric. Getting a compile error on code that was fine under Diamondback: " 'make_shared' is not a member of 'boost' "
  /home/prp/ros/whatever/src/pointCloudUtils.cpp:118: error: ‘make_shared’ is not a member of ‘boost’
  /home/prp/ros/whatever/src/pointCloudUtils.cpp:118: error: expected primary-expression before ‘>’ token

The code is as follows:
unsigned int minZPt_faster(const pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ> &cloud, const unsigned int kernelSize)
{
  KdTreeFLANN<PointXYZ>nN;

  nN.setEpsilon(.010);
  DefaultPointRepresentation<PointXYZ> pr;
  nN.setPointRepresentation(boost::make_shared<DefaultPointRepresentation<PointXYZ> > (pr));
  nN.setInputCloud(cloud.makeShared());
  nN.setMinPts(3);
  ...
}

The version of boost I have is 1.40. Unfortunately, as I didn't write this particular piece of code, I'm not clear on what the problem here is, and would appreciate any help! Thanks in advance...
