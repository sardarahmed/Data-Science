Q:

What are the ROS releases like 'indigo' and 'jade' for?

The core packages of these releases look more or less the same. Updates are released for both regularly via the apt repositories. So what is the key point for these named versions? Is is just the list of supported operating systems?

A:

It has to do with API and ABI updates. When a library developer wants to make significant changes to his project, this affects the dependent projects as well. In order to provide a stable interface for users and developers alike, ROS distributions are implemented, so that things are kept somewhat stable between each release!
