Q:

Move_base is not using plugin lib

What can make move_base not using plugin????
When i launch my move_base on hydro i see alot of ROS_INFO "using plugin..." and rosparam tells me they are really loaded.
But when i launch move_base on another pc using groovy nothing was loaded...
Thanks

A:

The costmaps in hydro are completely rewritten where each layer is a plugin. This functionality is not present in groovy where the entire costmap is a single library. This likely explains the differences in output that you see.
