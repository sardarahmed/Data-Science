Q:

How to merge old workspace into new ros version

Hi,
In the past I worked on ROS Indigo, but I wanted to upgrade to Jade, so I removed Indigo and installed jade (fully).
but now I have a problem, my previous work is only visible to ROS if I use source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash.
So how do I merge or upgrade that directory from a indigo to a Jade one.
I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.

Is "your previous work" somehow located inside of /opt/ros/indigo? Or is it in a workspace that you've been using with Indigo?

it was a workspace I was using with Indigo. And the directory is still in the same place on my hard-drive.

A:

I have the answer myself.
My old workspace wasn't in my $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
So with the simple command source devel/setup.bash (and a few hours headache) all of my former projects are working again in ROS Jade.
