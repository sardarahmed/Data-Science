Q:

Catkinize GTSAM

GTSAM is a useful library for SLAM and I'd like to include it in my project (which I build with catkin build my_project). GTSAM is a cmake library, so how can I "catkinize" it? That is, I would like to edit the current gtsam/CMakeLists.txt such that when I run catkin build my_project GTSAM gets installed and I can include its headers within my_project source files.
I've been through catkin docs and other questions (e.g.), but at this point I'm guessing blindly what lines to enter and where. Thanks in advance for any help!

A:

The suggestions by @gvdhoorn are valid and a good approach, but given the constraint on installing GTSAM via catkin_build here is a solution:
Add to the top of the current gtsam/CMakeLists.txt add,
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(gtsam)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS)

include_directories(
    gtsam
    ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
    ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

and at the bottom,
catkin_package()
install(DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_NAME}
        DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION}
        PATTERN ".cpp" EXCLUDE
        PATTERN ".txt" EXCLUDE
        PATTERN ".in" EXCLUDE
        PATTERN ".dox" EXCLUDE
)

And the package.xml should be updated to reflect catkin:  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>.
