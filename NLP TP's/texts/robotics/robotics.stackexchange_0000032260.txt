Q:

No accelerated colorspace conversion found

When i try to run some custom node to process some .avi video i have this error : i guess this error is related to opencv , i have tried all the sloutions , even recompiled vision_opencv with FFMPEG flag on , and urgraded ffmped with --enable-shared --enable-gpl --enable-swscale , but still no luck .

i converted the avi file to the standard avi file format used by openCV using "mencoder in.avi -ovc raw -vf format=i420 -o out.avi ",so i guess the file is not the problem. Actually don't worry about it, as the problem was something else ,this was just a warning.sorry for the inconvenience caused  .

What's the content/properties of the avi movie? How does your code look like?

A:

This is an ffmpeg bug/feature: not all conversions are accelerated. When compiling my own ffmepg 0.6.2 or 0.7 rc1, those warnings disappeared (the Ubuntu version seems to have them). Not sure of the flags to use though.
