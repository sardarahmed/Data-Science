Q:

how to connect to Servo Drive(googoltech CDHD ServoDrive ethercat) using ros_Ethercat and ros_control

I have not found any documents about how to connect to Servo Drive(googoltech CDHD servo drive) using Ethercat bus and ros_control in ROS website.
I use the joint trajectory controller (inside the  ros_controller_manager) as the low-level contorl and  use moveit package to carry out the high-level planning and  use qt to design the UI, now i need to   send low-level contorl conputing result to the servo Drive and get data from it through the Ethercat Bus.i have no idea about this,can anyone give me a hand ?
Thanks in advace!

A:

I think what you are looking for is http://wiki.ros.org/soem
" SOEM is an open source EtherCAT master library written in c"
It supports SoE and CoE based drives according to the feature list (as well as many other EtherCAT features), however I've not personally tried it on anything.
