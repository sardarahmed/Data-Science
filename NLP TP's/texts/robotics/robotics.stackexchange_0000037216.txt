Q:

Linking error with pcl_ros_tf

I'm trying to build a package that uses the unstable version of perception_pcl. When I rosmake my package, I get:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpcl_ros_tf

I found one other post with a similar issue, which was resolved by removing some old files cmake left around in the build dir. I made sure to rosmake with --pre-clean, and am still having this issue. Ideas?

A:

A fix for a similar problem (#5354) was committed today.
If you are using the Debian package, that fix is in the build pipeline and should be available in a few days.
If you want to try it right away, run the current svn version from this URL:

http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_unstable.

I was using trunk/perception_pcl_unstable from SVN. Doing a svn up fixed it. Thanks!
