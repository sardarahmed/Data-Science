Q:

Python script breaks after resetting model poses

I am using a python script to move a robot to a certain position, reset model poses and loop this process n times. However, after first reset, I obtain a message:    [WallTime: 1500641282.768572] [0.001000] ROS time moved backwards: 2089.084s.
I was wondering if there is a way to deal with the time problem, as I do not care what time it is in my program.
Thanks!

A:

I have realized, that while /gazebo/reset_simulation resets the clock, we can use /gazebo/reset_world, which only resets the poses.

Could you please just accept your own answer instead of closing the question? Thanks.
And a tip: for questions that are really Gazebo specific, I would recommend posting on answers.gazebosim.org, not here.
