Q:

unable to set initial pose in gazebo spawn_urdf_model (groovy)

(cross-posting from answers.ros.org)
In the update from Fuerte to Groovy, I  seem to have lost the ability to spawn an object at a given pose. Steps that reproduce this reproduce this problem (after updating to groovy):
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
rosrun xacro xacro.py `rospack find gazebo_worlds`/objects/table.urdf.xacro > /tmp/table.urdf
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -urdf -file /tmp/table.urdf -x 2 -y 2 -z 2 -model table_model

The table will spawn at (0,0,0). Can someone confirm if this is a bug?
Thanks!!
