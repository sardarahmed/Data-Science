Q:

Nav_view not found on ROS diamondback

Hi,
I was trying to install the nav_view package on ROS Diamondback on a 64 bit mac Snowleopard. However this is what I see,
j0813563:~ sagnikdhar$ rospack find nav_view
[rospack] couldn't find package [nav_view]
Has nav_view been deprecated ? If yes, what is the alternative package for Visualization applications ?
Thank you.

A:

See this ros-users email thread. The relevant bit from that thread:

So, for DTurtle, we're trying to remove dependencies on visualization stacks
like ogre from our core stacks. Since navigation falls into this category,
and the nav_view package relies on ogre, it has to move from navigation.
That much is decided. However, I'm not sure exactly where to put the
nav_view package. Do I create a new stack or just throw it in sandbox?

I'm not sure where it moved to, but I believe it has been deprecated in favor of using rviz.

You can download the cturtle version of nav_view here: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/navigation/tags/cturtle/nav_view/
