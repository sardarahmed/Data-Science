Q:

How to buffer subscribed topic?

Let's suppose node A subscribe the topic published by node B. Node A do many caculatations for the subscribed data, it will take a lot of time.  However, node B publish topic too fast and assume we can not change the publish rate. So many data published by node B can not be subscribed on time. These data will be lost.
So is there any method to buffer the subscribed topic?

A:

One easy way is to increase  queue size of subscriber.
ros::Subscriber sub = n.subscribe("topic_name", 1000, subscriber_callback);  //  queue size is 1000

How to do that using command?  I can not modify the source file.
