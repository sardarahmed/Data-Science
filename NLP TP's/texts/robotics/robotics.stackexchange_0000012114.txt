Q:

Robot Graphical Representation in Real Time

I'm working with a robot intended to be placed in a tele-echography environment. To control the robot I'm using a 6D space mouse that control each degree of freedom of the robot. However, since the rotation is made in the end effector, the end user would have difficulties in understanding where to move the mouse in order to do the desired motion, since the end effector's reference is constantly changing.
So, I'm thinking of doing a graphical representation of the motion of the robot in real time while the user controls the robot. The robot comes andith many API's to control it and to get sensor data. I'm currently using Qt Creator (C/C++) in order to send the mouse's commands to the robot, so I would like to integrate in my program some kind of simulator. What do you recommend as a C++ package / program in order to accomplish this?
Thanks

A:

If you are already using Qt, then Q3 3D would be an obviuos choice for 3D representations. Gaming engines like Unity (C#/JavaScript) or the Unreal Engine (C++) are also a suitable choice for representing robots in 3D. You will find plenty of exmples like this. 
Using directly OpenGL is also an option, but if you want anything else then just simple 3D rerpesentations, probably a gaming engine would be a better option.
