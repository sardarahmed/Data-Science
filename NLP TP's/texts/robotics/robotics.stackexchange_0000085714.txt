Q:

Is it possible to remove rosdep

I'm developing a project with ROS and have a question now.
I found that rosdep is really huge (Installing rosdep will increase the dist usage of /usr about 700 MB). As I know, rosdep is to solve the dependency issue. So I'm thinking if I can remove the whole rosdep to save my disk space. If possible, what should I do?

A:

You can remove rosdep by calling sudo apt-get remove python-rosdep however if you're looking to clean up disk space that's not what you want. Rosdep's size is well under 1 MB.
What you're probably seeing is the dependencies that you asked rosdep to install for you. They will need to be uninstalled just like any other package you installed. To get a list of what rosdep installed for a workspace use the --reinstall --simulate options and reinvoke rosdep install like you did before.
Note that when you uninstall these dependencies anything that relies on them will no longer work.
