Q:

is ROS navigation on C# possible?

Hi ROS team. Congratulations for all your work on ROS. I’m currently developing some software in Windows using an iRobot Create and a Kinect. I’m particularly interested in the navigation methods that you have included on ROS. However I’m using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with C#. I was wondering if I could add some .dll to my program to reuse the two steps of your navigation. Those would be:

Building a 2D map.
Use that 2D map to navigate my robot to a certain location.

Best regards,
Antonio

If you're willing to wrap the code yourself, it's possible in theory.  But the question was "can I add a .dll to my program" and use it in a C# program; the answer to that is no, because no one has written C# adapters for ROS, let alone the navigation stack.

As long as you only need a few message types exposed, it should be possible to write a wrapper DLL in C++ that could be loaded in a C# application, shouldn't it? Or is there some incompatibility somewhere? We're currently trying to do this at my company, so I'd love to know if that's the case.
