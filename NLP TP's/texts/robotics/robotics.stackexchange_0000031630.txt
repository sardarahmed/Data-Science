Q:

How to implement a complex application in ROS

Hi everybody!
I managed to get the navigation and arm_navigation stack running on my robot system (a custom system built at my university). So, I know how to send navigation goals to a mobile base and an arm. Now, I want to realize a more complex applikation, e.g. find objects in a room, move the base to them and grasp them.
I wonder what is the recommended way in ROS to implement a control structure for the application?
I'm thinking about implementing a state machine in one node that controlles the others, or is there a better way? How is it done on pr2?
Thanks for your help!
kind regards,
Benny

Thanks for your answer! SMACH looks interesting. I'll try it. Has anybody experiences with other approaches? I use ROS within a student project and it would be nice if I could compare several approaches.
