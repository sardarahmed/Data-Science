Q:

Converting a Compressed Image to QImage

Hi all,
I need to create a camera feed viewer that will need to run on very limited bandwidth networks. As such I want to use Compressed images instead of the raw image.
My application is python and uses PyQt for the gui.
How can I convert the /sensor_msgs/Compressed message to a QtGui.Qimage ?
Thanks
David

A:

Found it myself:
qimage = QtGui.QImage.fromData(compressedImage.data)
imageMain = QtGui.QPixmap.fromImage(qimage)
self.ui.label1.setPixmap(imageMain)

Can you elaborate how to give input to compressedIamge.data using publisher/subscriber ?

Have a look at ImageTransport::Publisher: http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport/Tutorials/PublishingImages .
