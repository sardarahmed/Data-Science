Q:

Moveit Tutorials step: Move_group interface Tutorial

I can not go forward in this step of the tutorial, after opening Rviz the tutorial says to insert the command:
roslaunch moveit_tutorials move_group_interface_tutorial.launch

Then the following message appears:
[Move_group_interface_tutorial.launch] is not a launch file in package [moveit_tutorials] nor is [moveit_tutorials] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Can anybody help me?

A:

Hi! you missplelled the package name. The comand should be this:  roslaunch pr2_moveit_tutorials move_group_interface_tutorial.launch.
Edit:
I found out that the pr2_moveit_tutorials is outdated.
Try to update the moveit, because they update recently. Write on the terminal: sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-moveit. After that you should be able to follow the tutorial without problems.

Thanks! This helped me.
But now my screen is different of the tutorial page.In tutorial says: Should appears a option to press "Next" button. I don't see this in my screen, I tried add some panels, I didn't succeed.
Can you help me one more time?

This answer is wrong (outdated).
The pr2_moveit_tutorials where recently merged into the moveit_tutorials repository and are in a subfolder here.
The roslaunch command given in the question works over here.
