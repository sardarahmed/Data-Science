Q:

Client [/rviz_15....] wants topic /odom to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/PointCloud/d8....], but our version has [nav_msgs/Odometry/cd

Iâ€™m getting this error:
The robot launch file starts and all appears good.
I start rviz then I get one Pose array dataset then this error
[ERROR] [1556066738.031123079]: Client [/rviz_1556066697211260013] wants topic /odom to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/PointCloud/d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca], but our version has [nav_msgs/Odometry/cd5e73d190d741a2f92e81eda573aca7]. Dropping connection.

This message seems to indicate the required data type should be [sensor_msgs/PointCloud] However, all the ROS info seems to indicate the proper /odom data type is [nav_msgs/Odometry]
At this time I suspect a AMCL or a RVIZ setup issue
Here is the AMCL launch file

You are correct, this is almost certainly an issue with your rviz config. Can you post your rviz config file or a screenshot of rviz?

I second @ahendrix. As you haven't posted the config yet: I don't think this has anything to do with the particlecloud. Check your configured display types, identify the one that is used to display a pointcloud and check if the topic configured there is called odom. If yes, remove and you should be good to go.
More hints to debug: rostopic info /odom should show you who is trying to publish/subscribe, rosnode info <NODE> should give you more info about the types the respective nodes expect.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-04-25:\

evidently I cannot post images

@CharlieD: I've given you sufficient karma to post a screenshot.
Know that this (ie: as a GUI is involved) is just about the only situation in which posting a screenshot makes sense.

A:

Your screenshot shows that you have a PointCloud display (the last one) where you have the Topic field set to odom. That is most likely the cause of your problems: the odom topic rarely carries sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 messages, so that is not going to work.

This was the issue, I deleted the PointCloud display and the error disappeared. I was able to manually drive the robot around and the PoseArray updated as expected. Thank You
