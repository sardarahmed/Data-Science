A:

Hello,
The node type that you request in the launch file does not exist.
According to the CMakeList of the p2os_urdf package (https://github.com/allenh1/p2os/blob/master/p2os_urdf/CMakeLists.txt) the node type is  "p2os_publisher".

If anyone is here from https://wiki.ros.org/p2os-purdue/Tutorials/P2OS%20Stage%20Simulation on Indigo, update p2os/p2os_urdf/launch/pioneer3dx_urdf.launch to type="p2os_publisher"
