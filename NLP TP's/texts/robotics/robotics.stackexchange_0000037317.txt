Q:

Unmet dependencies with unstable-desktop-full, Natty

Hi! I try to install ros-unstable-desktop-full on Natty 11.04, but I have next problem:
~$ sudo apt-get install ros-unstable-desktop-full
...
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-unstable-desktop-full : Depends: ros-unstable-vision-opencv (= 1.6.1-s1313731650~natty) but it is not going to be installed
                             Depends: ros-unstable-image-pipeline (= 1.5.2-s1313739013~natty) but it is not going to be installed
                             Depends: ros-unstable-image-transport-plugins (= 1.4.1-s1313731752~natty) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages
~$ sudo apt-get install ros-unstable-vision-opencv
...
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-unstable-vision-opencv : Depends: libopencv2.3-dev (= 2.3.1+svn6514+branch23-1~natty) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages

There was ros-electric previously, but I removed it completely.
How can I fix this problem? Thanks in advance!

A:

Unstable is unstable; it is not guaranteed to work.
If you want the latest builds, you should look at the ros-shadow-fixed repository. It has more recent builds of things, but is even more likely to be broken.
