Q:

What happened to the ros-fuerte-roslisp-* debs?

What happened to the ros-fuerte-roslisp-common and ros-fuerte-roslisp-support debian packages? Right now (2013-04-08) the Ubuntu 11.10 Debian repo seems to contain roslisp for electric, groovy and unstable, but not fuerte.

Yup, looks like it, thanks for the link. Since the packages are not marked as "intentionally missing", I'm still hoping they will be back soon. This recent round of updates probably shouldn't have been pushed to the repo...

Hopefully so. The Hudson status page shows devel copies building cleanly on Fuerte. You might open a ticket, in case the maintainers have not noticed the problem yet.

A:

Looks like the builds are failing on all the Fuerte platforms: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/fuerte.html
