Q:

custom package deploy

Hi, I would like shared a custom package with a  friend but i do not want he see the code. I'm try used catkin_make install to do it but he can't run roslaunch [package] [launch file] or rosrun [package] [node] even including setup.bash o setup.sh in the install directory. Roslaunch or Rosrun found the package but not the node

A:

After long search, I found the solution. The CMakeLists.txt file is so:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)

project(test)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
rospy
std_msgs
)

add_executable(test src/test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(test ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(test exynos_gencpp)
add_dependencies(test ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

install(TARGETS test
ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
   LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}
RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)

install(FILES
launch/test.launch
DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}
)

All right, but when I use Yaml to read file I found this error:

Error while loading shared libraries: libyaml-cpp.so.0.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.

Any one know what is the problem?
Thanks in advanced
