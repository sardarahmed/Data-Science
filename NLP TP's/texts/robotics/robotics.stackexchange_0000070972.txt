Q:

I am trying to install ROS Jade from source in debian jessie. I get the following error "Failed to process package 'pcl_conversions'"

I read somewhere that ros has its own version of PCL which it downloads and install. Now the error I get is following:
By not providing "FindPCL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "PCL", but
  CMake did not find one.
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PCL" with any of
  the following names:

    PCLConfig.cmake
    pcl-config.cmake

As far as I know this means that the package PCL doesn't exists. This makes not much sense to me as ROS must have downloaded and installed it. I am stuck at this point.
Any help would be really appreciated.
Thank you

Solved this issue. I had to install libpcl-dev package. After installing it the issue was resolved.
