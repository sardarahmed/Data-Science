Q:

ros distro "N" version not released?

As it says here
http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions
Every May it is expected to be published a ros version.
I know that we have ros2 Dashing Diademata, but if I am not wrong they are independent releases (at least it has a specific distro page (https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Releases/) .
I just use LTS versions of ros but, I am quite curious.
Does anybody know something? Maybe they are deciding to remove the non LTS version to focus more in ros2 ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

See https://discourse.ros.org/t/planning-future-ros-1-distribution-s/6538 for the plan for Noetic which is targeted for May 2020.
Since non-LTS releases have never been used much there is no ROS 1 release in 2019.

Edit: the Distributions/ReleasePolicy page has been updated (diff).

Should the Distributions page not be updated to reflect this?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2019-06-07:
Yes, that would be good.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-07:
Your answer implies you / OR are not going to do that. Is that correct?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2019-06-07:
I will delegate it to the ROS boss of Noetic. So it will get updated.

ROS boss

nice one.

So it will get updated.

Ok, great. It's not that 'others' don't know how to edit a wiki page, but it'd be good to have an authoritative source do that. Just so we don't communicate more incorrect information.

ROS boss

That is more of an internal name than an official title though ;-)

Hm. So no business cards then ? ;)
