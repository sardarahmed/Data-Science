Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Custom message

Hellow all !
I'm trying to create a custom message using Geomety messages and std msgs. But I can't seem to link it correctly. I've been following this tutorial but so far I'm having this error :
CMake Error at /home/malcolm/ros_ws/hydro_ws/catkin_ws/build/Tobot/open_tld_3d/cmake/open_tld_3d-genmsg.cmake:3 (message):
  Could not find messages which
  '/home/malcolm/ros_ws/hydro_ws/catkin_ws/src/Tobot/open_tld_3d/msg/square.msg'
  depends on.  Did you forget to specify generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES ...)?

  Cannot locate message [point] in package [open_tld_3d] with paths
  [['/home/malcolm/ros_ws/hydro_ws/catkin_ws/src/Tobot/open_tld_3d/msg']]

Indeed you can find point in geometry_msgs and in my CMakeList.txt I added that:
generate_messages(
   DEPENDENCIES
   geometry_msgs
   std_msgs
 )

So for my understanding, it should be able to find Point...
This is my square.msg in case :
point x
point y
float64 width
float64 height

Nothing really complexe and I'm pretty sure I'm missing something trivial but still...
Thanks a lot !

Indeed that was it ! I didn't think you'll need it because yu don't have std_psgs in front of the float64

A:

Should this be geometry_msgs/Point instead of point?

Just wanted to say thanks for this, fixed my issue. I was thinking the same thing as Maya, i.e. std.msgs wasnt necessary for string or float or int so why would geometry_msgs be necessary for Point. Im wondering where you found this information or maybe you just 'knew' it.

In my case I need a msg that have list of Point.
Your comment work like a charm.
geometry_msgs/Point[] points
