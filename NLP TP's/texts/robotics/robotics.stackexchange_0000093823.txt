Q:

colcon silently does nothing

Hi !
On

Ubuntu 18.04

I installed ROS Eloquant

Followed this tutorial: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber/#pypubsub

Everything was ok, until I reached the colcon build command.

It was doing nothing, and gave no error, no message, verbose output was:
  $ colcon --log-level 10 build
  DEBUG:colcon:Parsed command line arguments: Namespace(build_base='build', continue_on_error=False, event_handlers=None, executor='sequential', install_base='install', log_base='log', log_level=10, main=<bound method BuildVerb.main of <colcon_core.verb.build.BuildVerb object at 0x7f8dc26f30b8>>, merge_install=False, paths='.', symlink_install=False, test_result_base=None, verb_extension=<colcon_core.verb.build.BuildVerb object at 0x7f8dc26f30b8>, verb_name='build', verb_parser=CustomArgumentParser(prog='/usr/bin/colcon build', usage=None, description='Build a set of packages.', formatter_class=<class 'colcon_core.command.CustomFormatter'>, conflict_handler='error', add_help=True))

  $ echo $?
  0

with no error.
ROS package was not build. What am I doing wrong ?
thanks,

The fact that it uses the sequential executor indicates that you might not have installed all recommended colcon packages . Specifically colcon-parallel-executor seems to be missing. Can you share the output of dpkg -l | grep colcon.

Hi !
Thanks for the answer !
Your command returns with:
ii  python3-colcon-core                             0.4.3-1                                      all          Command line tool to build sets of software packages.
Howevere, I followed the official ROS install guide and found no mention of need of installing other colcone packages.
thanks,
g

Can you please post a link which instructions you followed.

A:

For that tutorial, a prerequisite is Creating a workspace and for that tutorial a prerequisite is colcon installation Which tells you to install python3-colcon-common-extensions
You don't clarify which installation instructions you followed. I suspect that you installed prebuilt binaries that don't need the build tools to run. There are different instructions for how to install ROS 2 to be able to run, versus being able to build.

Thanks a lot for the help and pointers ! Indeed, I've overlooked that dependencies...my bad, sorry. After redoing the complete exercise everything works. Thanks again !
