Can you specify what you already tried, what is not working (and provide the resulting error messages) please ? There are already multiples topics about this on this site, have you tried searching on google with site:answers.ros.org import service ?

@Delb Thanks for your answer.
Yes, I wanted to call a predefined service as I explained in #q342113. I will write it down as an answer.

A:

I Found the problem and each time I compiled the code, it couldn't found the .srv file.
when I wanted to import a service file from another package into a python node, I should first write the package name and the folder name inside that. After that, I use the file name for importing. Like:
from dynamixel_controllers.srv import TorqueEnable

dynamixel_controller is the name of the package that I want to import file from that and inside the folder srv there is a file named TorqueEnable.
