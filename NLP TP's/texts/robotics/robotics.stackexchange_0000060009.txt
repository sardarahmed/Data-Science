i am very new to this i was following ros tutorial when i used this cmd i got that error. from last 2 days i am trying really hard for a solution
this was the tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics

A:

rqt_graph is a graphical tool, and it sounds like you're trying to run it on a system that doesn't have a window manager.
Do other graphical programs work?
If you can provide more information about your setup, such as if you system has a graphical display, and/or if you're trying to use X forwarding over ssh, the community might be able to provide more help.

gedit is simple graphical text editor, it should be a simple test to see if the basic gui functionality is working.

Hello there. I'm having a similar problem:
sergio@remotepc:~$ rqt_graph
python: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server :5.

I'm working remotely over a ssh conection using TurboVNC. Withvglrun from VirtualGL, I manage to run Gazebo & Rviz...

My best guess is that your VNC server doesn't support some obscure X feature that rqt_graph is using. You may want to try using plain ssh X forwarding instead.

Uhm, I see. Thank you for your suggestion. Still, using Putty and connecting to the remote host with X forwarding I get the same error...

I'm out of ideas. Sorry.

Finally I got it working via MobaXterm_Personal_7.2 ! I can now see the rqt_graph and rqt_tools windows via ssh with MOBA. You could try it =). Cheers and thanks for the help.
