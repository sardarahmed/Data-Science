Q:

Costume world fail to load in Hector_quadrotor_gazeboo

hi there.
I am trying to load a costume world for Hector_quadrotor_gazebo using the same procedure i have done with turtlebot_gazebo that is:
i run :
roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo quadrotor_empty_world.launch

then edited the empty world and 'save the world as' 2.world.
nest step i ran this command:
~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo quadrotor_empty_world.launch world_file:=/home/mastlab/2.world 

and it ignored the edited world and loaded the original empty_world.
next thing i tried was to modify the (2) into the following:
~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo quadrotor_empty_world.launch world:=/home/mastlab/2.world 

and nothing change.
i think the problem is i dont know what is the default world for hector_quadrotor_gazebo because it was pretty straight forward with turtlebot_gazebo .( roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch) .
i am running ROS Kinetic and Gazebo 7. also I am quiet new to ROS and Gazebo.
Anyone have any idea?
thanks

A:

solved, by adding the line <arg name="world_name" value="/home/mastlab/2.world"/> to the launch file so it will be :
<include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
  <arg name="paused" value="$(arg paused)"/>
  <arg name="use_sim_time" value="$(arg use_sim_time)"/>
  <arg name="gui" value="$(arg gui)"/>
  <arg name="headless" value="$(arg headless)"/>
  <arg name="debug" value="$(arg debug)"/>
<arg name="world_name" value="/home/mastlab/2.world"/>
</include>
