A:

It's perfectly acceptable to subscribe to multiple topics and/or publish to multiple topics from within the same ROS node.  Each topic publisher or subscriber will have its own ros::Publisher or ros::Subscriber object, and each subscriber will probably have its own callback function (though this is not strictly required).
See here for a mroe detailed description of publishers/subscribers in C++.
Note that subscriber callbacks are generally called by background ROS threads.  If you use the default node setup shown in most examples (using ros::spin), all callbacks are called from a single thread.  See here for a more detailed explanation of multi-threaded usage of roscpp, if that's important for your application.
Edit:
Whoops!  Sorry for the double-answer.  I'll leave this here, in case any of this info is helpful.

Hi @Jeremy, when subscribing to multiple topics and the queue size is just 1, what will happen in spinOnce? Will I randomly lose some messages?
