You can edit and create wiki pages yourself. Just create an account and go ahead.

If you click on "Documentation Status" on your wiki page you will see that your new repository has not yet been indexed. You have just added the repo to the rosdistro half an hour ago. The job will get generated over night and then it might take up to three days to index your repo.
