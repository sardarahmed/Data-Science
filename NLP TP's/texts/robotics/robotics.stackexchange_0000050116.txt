Q:

How to read encoder ticks from arduino with pyserial

I am using a arduino due to read two encoders for wheel position. How do I send those number strings to the pyserial and have pyserial read it as left, right wheel(for ros Odom)? I am not all that good at programming, so how would I setup up the sending side and the receiving side? The encoders resolution is 4096 tick/rev and full motor speed is 3k rpm. I am using the output for the differential_drive ros package.

Hi Packrat,
Not quite what you're after, but you might find this useful:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ros_arduino_bridge
It's an arduino bridge to ROS that handles odometry & encoders onboard, and is a lot more lightweight than pyserial.
There's a lot of functionality from the differential drive in there too, like PID feedback for speeds.
Cheers,
Gavin

Well all processing is done by the onboard pc. I am trying to use the arduino as a relay to send the encoder ticks to the PC.
