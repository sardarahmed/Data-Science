Q:

Does a roslaunch start roscore when needed?

[Ubuntu 14.04, ROS Hydro]
As per the title.
It seems to me that it does.  However I would like to have it confirmed.
(Sorry if this is silly question.)
Cheers,
Nap
(Thank you for the answer and explanations.)

A:

Yes, it does. If there is no roscore already running.
As per Wiki on roslaunch:

roscore is a specialization of the
roslaunch tool for bringing up the
"core" ROS system.

And on roscore itself:

NOTE: If you use roslaunch, it will
automatically start roscore if it
detects that it is not already
running.

May be as an addition: It works, but can lead to strange behaviours if you start the core with a launch file, then some other launch files, you kill the first launchfile (and the core), start a new and nodes will not be able to connect anymore as they still rely on the old (vanished) roscore.

True, but that is always the case, even if roscore was started separately. Unfortunately ROS 1.0 is designed this way. Not sure, but this behaviour might change in ROS 2.0.

But It's harder to kill a terminal with a roscore in it than relaunching a launch-file and forgetting which launch contained the master. I normally use a seperate tmux for the roscore so that I can forget it and not accidentially kill it together with some other terminals.

ROS 2 does not have a master anymore but works completely peer-to-peer thanks to DDS.

I read the specialisation comment, but didn't see the one in the roscore documentation.  Cheers.
