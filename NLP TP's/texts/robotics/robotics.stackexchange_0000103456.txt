Q:

Some questions about C++ header file references when programming ROS2humble

This header file always fails to be referenced:
#include "tutorial_interfaces/msg/num.hpp"

I don’t know why. I am learning humble from Foxy’s tutorial. Is it because of version differences?

A:

Correct. In my install of Humble there is no 'tutorial_interfaces". In my Humble there is "example_interfaces" but there is no "num.hpp" there.
Assuming you're on linux, the msg files can be found here /opt/ros/humble
I suggest you find the Humble version of what you're trying to do,, if it exists.
