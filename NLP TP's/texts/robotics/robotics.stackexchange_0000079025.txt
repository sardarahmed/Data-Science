Q:

How to send logging to log files?

I have logging in my cpp files, like the following, and I'm trying to get the messages to appear in a file.
ROS_INFO_STREAM("testing");

I have these env vars to show where the logs should be placed, and how to config logging.
ROS_LOG_DIR = /tmp/node/etc/logs
ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE = /tmp/node/etc/rosconsole.config

And within the rosconsole.config file I have the following.
log4j.logger.ros=DEBUG

Any thoughts as to why I don't see my output in log files?

A:

you should define it in the config file, like this
log4j.logger.ros.log_test=WARN,rosout_a
log4j.appender.rosout_a=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.rosout_a.Threshold=WARN
log4j.appender.rosout_a.Append=true
log4j.appender.rosout_a.File=/home/name/output.txt
