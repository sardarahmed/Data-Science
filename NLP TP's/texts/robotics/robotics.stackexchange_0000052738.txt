Q:

Problem with the semantic_map editor knowrob_gui running

As the semantic map editor is moved into knowrob_gui. But the tutorial and document has not been updated. Do anyone know what is the problem with this:
When I compiled the knowrob_gui successfully in groovy on Ubuntu 12.04 and run it
$rosrun knowrob_gui KnowRobGUI
It displays that:
find: ‘/jre/lib/’: No such file or directory
Cannot find libjsig ... maybe you need to set JAVA_HOME?
It is not clear in the tutorial in knowrob org
PS: @Moritz would you please update the tutorial if possible?

A:

Well, the error message is rather clear, you need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Google helps how to do this:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
You can either enter this command in the shell or add it to your ~/.bashrc to have it set automatically in every newly opened shell.

Thanks, I set the JAVA_HOME at first but not work. I re-installed a new system and it is OK, but new error occurred. It says [FATAL ERROR   Could not find system resources

Try setting the SWI_HOME_DIR environment variable as indicated here:

export SWI_HOME_DIR=/usr/lib/swi-prolog
