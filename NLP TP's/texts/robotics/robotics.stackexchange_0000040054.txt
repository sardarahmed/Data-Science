Q:

Sharing dyanmic_reconfigure parameters between nodes

Is it possible to share dynamic_reconfigure parameters between nodes?
I have two nodes that share a parameter, and it would be nice if I could change it once and have it update both nodes.

A:

Just to close this out I'm pretty certain that it isn't possible; probably due to the way dynamic_reconfigure uses services.
