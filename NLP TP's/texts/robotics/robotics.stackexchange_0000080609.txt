Q:

catkin_package(CATKIN_DEPENDS ...) vs. find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS ...)

Hi,
Let's say I have a package A that depends on sensor_msgs. I have to add sensor_msgs to both

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS sensor_msgs)

catkin_package(CATKIN_DEPENDS sensor_msgs)

What is the difference between the two? What purpose do each of them solve? For instance, I noticed that message_generation has to be in the find_package call while the message_runtime has to be in catkin_package call. Why are they not in both?
Thank you.

A:

find_package() finds dependencies for this package.
catkin_package(CATKIN_DEPENDS) declares dependencies for packages that depend on this package.
For example: message_generation is needed by this package to build messages, while message_runtime is needed by dependent packages to use the already generated messages.
