A:

This is your image as mentioned in the topic title. Please read the  documentation of openni_launch where the topic depth/image is explained. This is a message as sensor_msgs/Image. Look this page to know how read it.
However if you want to read the distance (depth) I advise you to use camera/depth/points inside a node as PointCloud2 or XYZ point cloud using PCL.
