Q:

ROS C++ Custom header not found

Hi,
I created a ROS package with one main cpp file and another my_class.cpp file + my_class.h with some simple cpp code.
As long as I have all files in the src folder of the package, it works fine. As soon as I move the header file to another directory (for example my_package/include/my_package/my_class.h) and change the #include in main to the new path, the header file can't be found (error: include/sendPgmMarker/my_class.h: No such file or directory) when I try to compile.
I tried it like in this post: http://answers.ros.org/question/41873/ros-c-custom-class-compiler-and-linker/ but it doesn't work for me.
What changes do I have to make so the header can be found? Sure I could just let the header in the source folder, but I also want to add other external .h and .cpp files that are in other folders than my package.

A:

Please make sure you have a look at the support wiki page and always tag your question to make sure the right people get notified.
How does your include line look like? I suspect something like:
#include <include/sendPgmMarker/my_class.h>

You must not specify the include subdirectory. It is added to the include path already. Try:
#include <senPgmMarker/my_class.h>
