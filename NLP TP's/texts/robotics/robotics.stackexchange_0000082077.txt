Q:

Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-armel/Packages'

Hi..
I AM trying to install Ubuntu Arm install of ROS INDIGO ,on snapdragon QS 600. OS is linoro version 14.10.
While doing apt-get install it is giving me error as
Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ROS/ubuntu/dists/trust/Release Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-armel/Packaged' In release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)

A:

There are no binaries being built for Indigo on Ubuntu 14.10, not even for x86/amd64.
The only Ubuntu OS for which Indigo binaries are provided is Ubuntu Trusty (14.04).
See REP-3 - Target Platforms - Indigo Igloo and wiki/Installation/UbuntuARM.

you could perhaps try to override OS detection (ROS_OS_OVERRIDE) and add the Trusty ROS repository to your Utopic system, but I don't think I have to explain why that is not recommended.

Edit: also just noticed this:
Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ROS/ubuntu/dists/trust/Release [..]

trust is not a valid Ubuntu OS codename. Should that be trusty (but see earlier note)?
