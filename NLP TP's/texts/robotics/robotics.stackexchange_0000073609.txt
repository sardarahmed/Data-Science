A:

Update: If the measurements are outside the LaserScan message's reported min-max range, RViz won't visualize them.
In RViz, expand the Global Options dropdown menu (upper left) and set the Fixed Frame to your laser sensor's frame ID (the frame_id of your LaserScan messages).
This will allow you to visualize the laser scans without having to worry about the map -> laser transformation.

Have you succeeded in launching RViz? rosrun rviz rviz
Comment by Emilien on 2016-04-27:
yes and run laser scan with topic /scan but on rviz i dont found position transformer of laser scan

I don't understand what you mean by "i dont found position transformer of laser scan". Is that an error message? If not, maybe post a screenshot? Also, what's your 'Fixed Frame' in RViz? (see my answer above for how to find that)
Comment by Emilien on 2016-04-27:
fixed frame is /odom and i add laser_scan and odometry but i don't have laser_scan result in rvis
i hope that is clear
Comment by spmaniato on 2016-04-27:
OK, cool. Now, in RViz, change the Fixed Frame from /odom to whatever your laser scanner's frame_id is. (That should let you visualize laser scans without any influence from the rest of the system.)

nothing also, this is a screenshot

Cool, thanks. One last sanity check: rostopic echo /scan Are messages being published? Do they look reasonable? (frame_id, ranges, range_min, range_max) For example, if the measurements are outside the min-max range, RViz won't visualize them.
Comment by Emilien on 2016-04-28:
yes the measurements are outside the min-max range
Comment by spmaniato on 2016-04-28:
Then that's why RViz is ignoring them :-)

@jack, I've updated my answer above based on our discussion here in the comments. If it is correct, could you please "mark it as correct" using the checkmark button? It will help people who read this in the future.

@spmaniato, i've uploaded my code. I have a problem of conversion from range to laser scan
