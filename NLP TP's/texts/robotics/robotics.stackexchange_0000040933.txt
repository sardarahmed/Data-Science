Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rosbag slow?

Hi.
I'm using ROS with two machines on wireless network.
Let say, machine #1,#2.
The machine #1 has USB camera, and running roscore.
The machine #2 is for viewing /usb_cam/image_raw/compressed, and recording video using rosbag.
Before run rosbag recording, everything is fine. However, when I ran the rosbag, both machine become very slow and about after 30secs later, the video is stucked.
Does anyone have experienced this problem?
To record using rosbag, I have used following command.
$ rosbag record
Thanks.

A:

The (likely) problem here is that ROS uses peer-to-peer transport, so adding a second subscriber (the rosbag) doubles the number of bits that need to get pushed over your wireless link.
You can use a republish node to solve this; run it on machine #2, and then run the viewer and rosbag record on machine #2, but subscribed to the republish node, not the actual data topic. Then you move the bits over the wireless link once (machine #1 -> republish node), and then twice on the loopback interface (republish -> viewer and republish -> rosbag).
