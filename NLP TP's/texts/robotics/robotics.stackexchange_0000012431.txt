Q:

Euler Angles Order For Quadrotor Modelling

I am modelling a quadrotor and I need to choose an order for the rotations that transfer vectors which are represented in Earth Frame to the Body Frame.   

what is the most logical order for these rotations?
which order is likely used?
does the order have a big effect on the control of the quadrotor?

Thanks in advance for any answers

A:

I don't understand what you mean by order. I have always seen the quadrotor modelled like this, for instance.
For your question of how to represent the body-frame vectors into inertial frames, no quadrotor knowledge is necessary. Just Applied Mechanics, where the rotation matrix R showed in previous link is necessary.
It has no influence on the control, as the control is usually modelled with body-frame angles of the quadrotor.
