Q:

nav_msgs::Path without the field "pose"?

Hi,
I m trying to compile a code but I cannot do that since I m getting the following error:
error: ‘nav_msgs::Path_<std::allocator<void> >::_poses_type’ has no member named ‘pose’

But in the API documentation it is reported to have such field.
Furthermore I tried to echo another package not made by me and it outputs:
header: 
  seq: 25
  stamp: 
    secs: 1415216779
    nsecs: 703217309
  frame_id: map
poses: 
  - 
    header: 
      seq: 0
      stamp: 
        secs: 1415216779
        nsecs: 703217309
      frame_id: map
    pose: 
      position: 
        x: 5.84004402161
        y: -0.0
        z: 0.0
      orientation: 
        x: 0.0
        y: 0.0
        z: 0.0
        w: 1.0

as you can see there is poses and pose.
In my CMakeLists.txt I have already enable to compile for nav_msgs too.
What could be?

A:

'Poses' is an array member of "Path" of type PoseStamped. Each PoseStamped has its own "pose" member (confusing, right?), so I think you should index it similar to the following:
some_path.poses[some_index].pose
