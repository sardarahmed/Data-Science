Q:

hector slam with existing map

Hi,
I would like to know if there is a way to use hector_slam package starting from an existing map (generated with Hector_slam) and upgrading/expanding it.
I've been trying but without results.
Thanks in advance.

This is a request that pops up every once in a while (another example here). It's currently not implemented, but certainly possible to add it with a little time investement (time I don't have at the moment).
