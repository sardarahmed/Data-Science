Q:

Hokuyo utm-30lx restart command

Hello :)
I have a Hokuyo utm-30lx mounted on the patrolbot from mobilerobots, it was working quite nice with a 12V external power supply, then I decided to connect it to the 12V PWR right power I/O bay  and suddenly I got no power from the bay and I had to turn the 12V power on again from the LCD panel. But, suddenly my computer could not read the device /dev/ttyAMC0
I have tried with to connect it under  windows and it is the same problem.
Just wondering whether there is a way to find out the error and make the device work again
I am using ROSARIA in ROS.
Is there any command to the laser so I can restart the device?
Cheers :)

A:

Ehm, that doesn't sound like a software problem. I don't know your robot, but suddenly no power shouldn't happen (I guess). The only thing I could image if there is a power cycle is that the device switched. Check with dmesg if that happened. There is then usually a /dev/ttyACM1 or similar.
