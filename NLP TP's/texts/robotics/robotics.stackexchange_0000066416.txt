Q:

Raspberry Pi 2 or Odroid U3 enough performance to run ROS and AR-Tag Pose Estimation?

Hello experts,
the title says it all. I want to implement a Pose Estimation of AR-Tags on a Raspberry Pi 2 / Odroid U3 or similar board. But I have no clue, if these boards have enough performance to deliver a "smooth" estimation...
A visual output is not required or can be attained through a ssh access from my pc (to save performance).
Would be nice if someone could share his experiences with a Raspberry Pi 2 / Odroid U3 (or similar board) and ROS...
Thanks for your help!
Greetings Johannes

A:

I have not got Ondroid U3 or RPi2, however I have run this AR-tag node with usb_cam node on Beagle Bone Black board.
I got the satisfactory results. Messages with marker's pose was published each 100 ms (10 Hz) for 320x240 resolution.
For resolition 640x480 I have got only 2-3 Hz. CPU loading was about 60% for 320x240 and about 90% for 640x480.
I think that Ondroid U3 and RPi2 are more powerful, so you can use them for marker detection.
Best Regards,
Alex

good news :) if it works on a single core, the RPI2 or Odroid U3 quad cores should have enough power (even for 640x480 (or higher)). Thanks for your help!

It is truth, if the AR-tag detector supports several cores.
