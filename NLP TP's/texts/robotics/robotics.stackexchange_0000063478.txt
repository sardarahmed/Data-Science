Q:

ethernet connection via ros

hi guys,
i am trying to connect my laptop via LAN to my robot. So my question is, are there already ethernet interfaces for ros? With which a NODE can access on the Ethernet port? For example I can ping my robot?

A:

At first would I suggest you to synchonize your robot installing chrony
$sudo apt-get install chrony

then, if you have the later versions of Ubuntu you have access to Zeroconf which simplyfies a lot the whole story.
With hostname you can find the name of your machine, for istance:
$ hostname
my_computer

$ hostname
my_robot

Now I suggest you the following trick: just add .local at the end of your hostname, then you can do all operations you want to:
$ping my_robot.local

and f course:
$ping my_robot.local

after that set the ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME in yur robt and desktop as in the tutorial.
Hope it helps
