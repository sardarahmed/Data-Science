Q:

Where is the value_learner package?

Hello, I am trying to find a source for the value_learner package described here: http://wiki.ros.org/value_learner
Unfortunately, the only source location I can find is the svn repo described here, but this version seems to be different from the one described in the wiki page.
Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

A:

I found at least one version of it on the old code.ros.org repository:
https://code.ros.org/trac/wg-ros-pkg/browser/branches/trunk_cturtle/sandbox/value_learner?rev=46744
You might find a newer version if you look around in there. Also if you find something you want to work with I would highly recommend forking it to github or google code, since code.ros.org may go away at anytime.

Thank you. It looks like even the newest version (@ 55339) does not have all the launch files described on the wiki page. I guess this is a lost package? :/

It may have been moved somewhere else in the svn tree, but I don't know, I've never worked with that package.
