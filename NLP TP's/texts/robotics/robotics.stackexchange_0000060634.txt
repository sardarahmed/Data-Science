A:

The problem has been solved by typing $roscore first before typing
$roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 
$rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam

This is on 14.04.1 LTS using ROS Indigo.

I fixed that by updating the openni launch file and adding a prefix. Then I got images in the rgbdslam GUI!

I also have the same messages. @monkeyiq, can you give me more details on how to fix this one by adding a prefix?

yooncs8, you need to remove "$(arg tf_prefix)/" from the rgb_frame_id and depth_frame_id parameters in openni.launch.
