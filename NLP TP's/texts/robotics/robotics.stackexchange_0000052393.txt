Q:

Where should I 'source'?

I'm new to ROS and have been trying to understand how to start building packages and am not able to understand the exact purpose of 'source.' I understand that to test a package I am working on, I should 'source' the setup.* file within the devel file in my workspace.
What exactly is the difference between the source file in the devel space, the install space, or sourcing my environment with "/opt/ros/groovy/setup.sh" ...when would I use one over the other?
Thanks for your help!

A:

The /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash file adds the packages in the directory /opt/ros/groovy/stacks directory (installed from binaries), while the devel/setup.bash ads the files in the src directory of your catkin build environment. It is OK to source both at once; however, you should only need to source the devel/setup.bash file if you are doing work in the catkin workspace. Hope this was of use to you!
