Q:

Determine robot's position in a nearby room

Scenario
I have 2 roaming robots, each in different rooms of a house, and both robots are connected to the house wifi. Each robot only has access to the equipment on itself.
Question
How can the robots be aware of each other's exact position using only their own equipment and the house wifi?
EDIT: Additional Info
Right now the robots only have:

RGBDSLAM via Kinect
No initial knowledge of the house or their location (no docks, no mappings/markings, nada) 
Can communicate via wifi and that part is open ended

I'm hoping to be able to stitch the scanned rooms together before the robots even meet. Compass + altimeter + gps will get me close but the goal is to be within an inch of accuracy which makes this tough. There IS freedom to add whatever parts to the robots themselves / laptop but the home needs to stay dynamic (robots will be in a different home every time).

A:

Basically you can utitilize one global frame for both robots since each robot has its own SLAM. SLAM provides an estimate for a robot's pose (i.e. location and direction). If you unify the global frame for both SLAMs, then you can determine the poses of the two robots. I've drawn a picture to illustrate my approach. 

As you can see from the above picture, two robots are placed in one global frame. Once they start running, there is one landmark in this picture. Each SLAM will utilize this landmark to estimate the robot's pose, therefore, since the robots can communicate with each other, each robot can have an estimate for the other robot's pose.
