Q:

missing rosdeps for gtest and paramiko running OS: Arch

hello,
I installed a new ARCH system and made a rosinstall for the full desktop. At the end I got an error message because the rosmake for ros and ros_comm did not work. Manually I started the rosmake ros and it worked, but not the ros_comm. After the PACKAGES zip (package found) the process runs into my editor with the pkgbuid for log4cxx. After leaving the editor it starts again with the packages and into the editor with the pkgbuild.
For a second try I only started make in the ros_comm directory. Without this, I can not start roscore.
Can someone help?
Uwe

A:

You need to create a rosdep rule to install paramiko and gtest on arch and add it to the rosdep.yaml file. There's a tutorial for this
