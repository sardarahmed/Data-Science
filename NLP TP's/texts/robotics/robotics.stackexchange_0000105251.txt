Q:

SW2URDF model is floating in Gazebo

I get my URDF using SW2URDF plugin in SolidWorks. Iam following this instruction.
From the instruction, I need to add link and joint as "world" and set the child link to the base link, (It is needed since Im having an warning "The root link base_link has an inertia specified in the URDF, but KDL does not support a root link with an inertia." and the model is not appearing if not added). One thing I noticed is that the xyz origin of the joint "world" is 0.17 which makes my model floating in gazebo.
<joint 
  name="world_joint" 
  type="fixed">
  <parent 
    link="world"/>    
  <child 
    link="base_link"/>
  <origin 
    rpy="0 0 0" 
    xyz="0.0 0.0 0.17"/>
</joint>

I dont know why but Im expecting that the gravity should take effect, that even it is floating, the model should drop once it is running. Then, I checked the "link" from the "ground_plane" under "Model" tab and the gravity is set to False, I tried to click it to change to True but it always goes to False.
I also tried to change the xyz origin of the "world" joint, expecting that the model should have contact in the ground:
<joint 
  name="world_joint" 
  type="fixed">
  <parent 
    link="world"/>    
  <child 
    link="base_link"/>
  <origin 
    rpy="0 0 0" 
    xyz="0.0 0.0 0.0"/>
</joint>

But all the models are on the center.
What could be the problem?

The model is good only when the z value is 0.17.
BTW, Im doing a differential drive robot. I also added libgazebo_ros_diff_drive to drive the wheels, no problem with that as the wheels are moving when I publish in /cmd_vel, but the robot is not moving as it is floating.

A:

I resolved it by changing the model (redesigning the model on Solidworks)
All the wheels should be touching the floor, in my case the caster wheel is above the ground by 1mm and gazebo is not happy with that making it difficult to check the coordinate system and axis of the part.
