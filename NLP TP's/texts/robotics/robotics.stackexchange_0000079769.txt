Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rqt compass

Hi!
I want to make a compass plugin in rqt, but I'm finding it quite hard since it's not a widget for compass in qtCreator.
Have anyone done this before or have any suggestions on how to do it/where to begin?
I'm using python if that's relevant.
I've tried to implement this one from the link below, but I get errors on qwt that I can't figure out.  https://github.com/SyllogismRXS/syllo-ros/tree/master/catkin_ws/src/rqt_compass

A:

You could try QCompass. It looks like available since Qt5.1 only so you may want to try it on ROS Kinetic or higher for better Qt5 support.

Do you have any experience with QCompass? I've only made plugins based on components found in QtCreator and QCompass isn't there.

I haven't used it. AFAI remember you can use components that don't show up on QtCreator. Just do it :)
