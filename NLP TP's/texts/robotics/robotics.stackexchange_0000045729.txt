Q:

ROS on gumstix for on-board processing

I wonder how good a gumstix can run a ROS-based application using "gumros"(for instance). For example this link mentions that it has 512 MB of memory. I would like to know if this one is sufficient using gumros to build an application like doing pose estimation using openCV or similar.
What I see, one of my packages consumes about 100 MB on my laptop. But with gumstix, it still needs to install OS and install ROS etc, will it be capable? Any experience having this running in (almost)real-time or on-board(at least)?
Thanks in advance.

It's been done.
Also, disk space shouldn't be an issue if you have an SD card.
