Building rosconsole_bridge on OSX fails

Hello,
when trying to build rosconsole_bridge on OSX it fails with this error:

@Dirk Thomas is this related to the backport to groovy?

This appears to be an issue on all platforms: http://jenkins.willowgarage.com:8080/view/GbinP32/job/ros-groovy-rosconsole-bridge_binarydeb_precise_i386/64/console

@J.M.T. we are working on fixing the issue, if you want to work around it you can use an older version of console_bridge, but it is probably best to just wait for us to release rosconsolse_bridge (it will happen shortly) and then update your version or rosconsolse_bridge when we do.

A:

I just released rosconsole_bridge 0.2.7 into Groovy. That will fix the build issue. Sorry for the inconvenience.
