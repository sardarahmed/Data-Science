Q:

rostopic could not get message class, but rosmsg shows msg

I have a custom message /adc_interface/EMGSignal.
If I run rosmsg show EMGSignal it displays the message correctly.
However, if I try to run rostopic echo /adc_interface/EMGSignals I get:
ERROR: Cannot load message class for [adc_interface/EMGSignal]. Are your messages built?

I also get a similar error when trying to use rqt_plot.
The message has been tested and used on Groovy on another computer.
I am running Hydro on my computer.
I have run catkin_make. My .bashrc is:
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="/home/craig/Documents/workspace/551/project":$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

I am new to Ros and may have some configuration/installation issues (I thought it would be fun to uninstall python from Linux Mint - it wasn't).
Additionally, running roswtf produces:

Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
No package or stack in context

A:

I got this one figured out.
I needed to source the devel/setup.bash file that catkin generates.
