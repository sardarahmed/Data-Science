Q:

Trouble Installing ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 20.04 with arm64/x86_64 Architecture

I've been encountering an issue while attempting to install ROS 2 Humble on my Ubuntu 20.04 system. My machine supports both arm64 and x86_64 architectures. Despite following the official installation instructions closely, I run into the "unable to locate package ros-humble-desktop" error every time I try to execute the installation command.
Here are the steps I've followed based on the instructions from the ROS.org page for Humble:
1. Added the ROS 2 repository and keyring as follows:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y

sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

2. Updated and upgraded my package lists:
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade

3. Attempted to install ROS 2 Humble packages:
   sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

However, this results in the "unable to locate package ros-humble-desktop" error.
Interestingly, I came across a similar issue on ROS Answers where a user encountered package location errors due to their system running on an ARMhf platform. However, after checking my system using dpkg --print-architecture and lscpu, I confirmed that my system is on arm64 and x86_64, which should be compatible with ROS 2 Humble according to REP 2000.
I'm reaching out to see if anyone has faced a similar issue or could offer guidance on resolving this error. Could this problem be related to my prior attempts to uninstall ROS 2 Foxy and clean my system? Or is there something else I'm missing in the setup process for ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 20.04?
Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!
