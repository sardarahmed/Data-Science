Q:

ueye ros driver not working properly

Hi,
I have a ueye IDS camera, model 1220LE-C, and I have tried the following ueye driver:
ros.org/wiki/ueye
With this driver, after a number of frames the camera pauses, but continues after 2 or 3 seconds. To check if it was a hardware or software compatibility problem I used the following ROS driver, without experimenting any problems:
ros.org/wiki/ueyecamera
So it seems to be a ROS driver problem with my camera model. Has anyone experimented the same behaviour with the first driver?
PD: running ROS fuerte, on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bits and IDS driver version 4.20_64_Bit.

A:

I've seen kind of similar issue (with UI155xSE-C) and ended up getting success by replacing mother board (, which was causing many other issues as well anyway). In addition, changing zoom size in cfg (and build the package) worked for us to get smooth images too. HTH.
