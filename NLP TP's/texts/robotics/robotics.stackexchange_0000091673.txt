Q:

CMake Error: /catkin_ws/build/catkin/catkin_generated/version/package.cmake returned error code No such file or directory

I'm trying to do catkin_make with python3 on Arch Linux, but I get this error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:11 (message):
  execute_process(/home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build/python3
  "/opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/parse_package_xml.py"
  "/opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/../package.xml"
  "/home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build/catkin/catkin_generated/version/package.cmake")
  returned error code No such file or directory
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package_xml.cmake:74 (safe_execute_process)
  /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/all.cmake:167 (_catkin_package_xml)
  /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:20 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:56 (find_package)

Can anyone please help me solving this issue, seems some part of catkin wasn't generated before.

can you check which of those files doesn't exist?
/home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build/python3 seems suspicious to me: do you have a python3 binary in /home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build?

The file pacakge.cmake doesn't exist. And since catkin_make never finished successfully, there neither a py3 nor py2 binary in the folder. I always used this catkin flag: catkin_make  --cmake-args -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3

So this /home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build/python3 exists?
But /home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build/catkin/catkin_generated/version/package.cmake doesn't?
Comment by bionade24 on 2019-05-14:
None of both files exist.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-05-14:
Then I would assume the immediate problem is /home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build/python3. /home/oskar/workspace/catkin_ws/build/catkin/catkin_generated/version/package.cmake is a later problem.

Do you know which package is mandatory for the python executable?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-05-14:
I don't understand your question.
python3 should probably be provided by your OS.
The issue may be that for some reason, the CMake macros/functions are expecting a python3 binary/link to be present in the build space. That may be perfectly normal for Catkin to do, I don't know. I doubt it though.

So I'll do a little bit research tomorrow trough cmake's python linking. Thanks for your suggestions.

A:

I solved it by specifiying the interpreter value with the full path. Before, I used catkin_make  --cmake-args -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3 and then changed it to catkin_make  --cmake-args -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 Now it seems working.

The full path seems to be used in other Q&As with similar subjects as well (and in the catkin_tools documentation, here fi), so that is probably required.
It might be enough (and more robust / portable) to set the PYTHON_VERSION though. See #q114801 fi.
