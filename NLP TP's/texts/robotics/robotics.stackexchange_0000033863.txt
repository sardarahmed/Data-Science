Q:

Version of Stage and Gazebo in Diamondback

Hi Everyone
Which version of Stage (I think it is 3.2.2 - not sure) and Gazebo are used in Diamondback (ROS 1.4.8).
Is there a command line facility to find it out ?
Thank you for your help.

for Gazebo, Diamondback uses a patched gazebo wg branch r8967.  More details can be found in the ros makefile.
