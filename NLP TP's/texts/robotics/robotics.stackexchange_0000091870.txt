Q:

Trouble installing ROS Melodic on Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 64-bit

I'm having problems installing ROS Melodic version on my Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 64-bit. I've followed the instructions from ros.org for installation, but this is what keeps happening:
First instruction:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

OK, no problem with that.
2nd:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

Result:
Executing: /tmp/apt-key-gpghome.S60mWkJIrq/gpg.1.sh --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
gpg: chave 5523BAEEB01FA116: "ROS Builder <rosbuild@ros.org>" não mudada
gpg: Número total processado: 1
gpg:              não modificados: 1

Apparently OK (if any doubt with the translations, because some parts are in Portuguese, just ask, or you can translate from the Internet, they aren't any complicated expresisons).
3rd:
sudo apt update

That's where the issues start. I get this as a response:
Atingido:1 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security InRelease
Atingido:2 http://br.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic InRelease
Ign:3 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic InRelease

E: The repository 'http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic Release' does not have a Release file.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.

And then, the following instructions are to install ROS Melodic (sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full)
And the result is:
Lendo listas de pacotes... Pronto
Construindo árvore de dependências       
Lendo informação de estado... Pronto
E: Impossível encontrar o pacote ros-melodic-desktop-full`

(The last line says it's impossible to find the required package)
So, I've serached a lot for a solution, I've disabled PPAs, I'm using the recommended ROS Package for my Ubuntu, and I don't know what else to do.
I'm also a beginner on both Linux and ROS (and ROS forums, for that matter), so I'm apologizing in advance for any stupid mistake I may be making.
Thanks in advance for anyone who may be helping.

Edit 1: Alright, so here's what happens in every last suggestion:
I have added the deb files, then, after sudo apt update, I get:

After choosing the "best server", when also, as I close "Software & Updates", I get an error message, as it fails to download repository information again, I get this message on sudo apt update:

Edit 2: After all the tipos regarding the issue on #q325039, I successfully changed the key to the server, even the ROS Melodic tutorial has changed it, but it's still not working. The response I'm getting now is this:

The parts in portuguese are only saying that it has solved the packages, connected, the HTTP recquisition was sent, the file was downloaded and saved. But, even though it had apparently downloaded, I try running the installationg commands, and it won't work, the sudo apt update results are the ones from edit 6, without "obter 5" until "obter 31", and it still doesn't find the package for installation.

Can you check whether you're running into #q325039?

A:

gpg: chave 5523BAEEB01FA116: "ROS Builder <rosbuild@ros.org>" não mudada

From the apt-key output shown I'm pretty sure this is #q325039.
Update the key, undo any changes you made to your sources.list (and files under that directory) and run sudo apt update again.

Edit:

After following the instructions on disabling proxy and returning to the unchanged configurations, I got this response when running sudo apt update for the first time:

6 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.

Where is the ROS package repository here?
Is sft.if.usp.br a ROS package mirror?

After that, I ran the final (installation) command, but the response was the same as always (in the beginngin of the question it's written). I tried yet again running the entire installation procedure, but the response to all command returned to being the same as the last time.

From the last apt update output you show, no ROS package repository is configured on your system, so apt not being able to find ros-melodic-desktop-full would seem to be expected.
You still haven't shown us the output of
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

and
cat /etc/apt/sources.list

without that we cannot help you any further.

Edit 2:
It would appear that apt is not downloading the ROS repository indices. Without those it cannot know about any ROS packages, so the apt install error is expected.
As to why apt is not downloading the ROS package indices I can't say anything right now.
Try a sudo apt clean and then a sudo apt update to see if that changes anything.
Edit: note: this does not appear to be an issue with the key at this point. apt is really not even attempting to download the indices. Verifying the signatures is done at a later stage.
What is the output of:
sudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist="sources.list.d/ros-latest.list" -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts="-" -o APT::Get::List-Cleanup="0"

Edit 3:

Output of the sudo apt-get update -o Dir::Etc::sourcelist="sources.list.d/ros-latest.list" -o Dir::Etc::sourceparts="-" -o APT::Get::List-Cleanup="0" command:

Ign:1 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic InRelease

 Err:2 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic Release
      404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.26 80]

 E: The repository 'http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic Release' does not have a Release file.
 N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
 N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.

This would suggest there is still a problem with the keys.
Can you make sure you have successfully removed the old key and imported the new one? Refer to #q325039 again if you need the commands.
You could check whether the key is imported by running apt-key list and looking for the key with a uid of Open Robotics <info@osrfoundation.org>.
Can you please also show us the output of both commands?

Edit 4: At this point it would be good to take a step back and check some basics.
Could you please create (if you don't already have one) an Ubuntu 18.04 install USB stick and boot from it.
Then follow the ROS Melodic installation instructions. They already use the new key, so no need to follow #q325039.
If sudo apt update does work on the USB booted OS, then I believe the issue is with your current install. I'll leave it to you to decide whether to reinstall or to keep trying to diagnose what is wrong with your current installation.

I've updated the key, but then, aftersudo apt update, I still get the "release file" problems. I've added the response to the code in the original question.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-20:
Seeing as you've made quite a few changes to various related settings, can you please make sure that things are back to how they were?
What is the output of cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list and cat /etc/apt/sources.list for instance?
What was the output when updating the key?
It still looks like the key has not been updated.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-20:
This is the output of the updating key command:
`Executing: /tmp/apt-key-gpghome.UB4RUijhZn/gpg.1.sh --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-20:
can you please always just add such updates to your original question? Comments are not suited for such things.
And can you then include the output of the two cat commands?
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-20:
I've reset thing to the way they were before, and also disabled proxy, following another comment's sugestion. The response changed slightly, I've updated it above. But still the response to the instaliing command was the same, and after I tried sudo apt update again, the response returned to the way it was before.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-20:\

the response returned to the way it was before.

I do not know what this means. There are too many edits, comments and alternative answers here for me to know what you are referring to.
If you want my help, be explicit.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-20:
For "the way it was before", check the 2nd edit in the question, that's the response I'm getting for sudo apt update.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-20:
stf.if.usp.br is just the server I'm downloading from, the best one for my location.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-20:
The outputs of the "cat" commands are in one of the edits the question above.
I've also added the output to the last code you've asked in "edit 2"
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-21:
The output regarding the commands from #q325039 are added now on "edit 6", just tried that now and the response is still very similar to the one in "edit 2" (the first time I've removed the key and installed with the new one".
The output from apt-key list is in the same edit, and there is an UID of Open Robotics (and the ROS address).
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-21:
I don't see an "edit 6".
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-21:
It's there, just below "Edit 5". I don't know if moderators need to approve, or something like that, I'm new to the forum, but if I could send you a print screen, I'd send, it's appearing normally here to me.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-21:
I see it now.
I must say at this point I'm unsure as to what is happening: you appear to have the correct key in apts keyring.
You wrote you are behind a proxy before. Did you restore the proxy's configuration as well?
Can you download the release file manually? So does this work:
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/bionic/Release

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-22:
You could try and see whether the command provided by @nickzherdev in #q325039 works:
sudo launchpad-getkeys

I'm not sure what that does differently, but it could work.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-22:
I've tried the installation procedure with and without a proxy, and the outputs didn't change at all, I believe that's not the issue.
I've tried also donwloading the release file manually, the outuput is in "Edit 7" in my question, it appears to have downloaded, but the other commands are still not working.
And my terminal didn't even recognize sudo launchpad-getkeys, it says "command not found".
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-22:
You may need to install it first. See How to Automatically Import Missing GPG Keys in Ubuntu for one way to install it.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-22:\

I've tried also donwloading the release file manually, the outuput is in "Edit 7" in my question, it appears to have downloaded,

did you check the contents?

but the other commands are still not working.

I did not expect them to.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-22:
What do you mean by "chekc the contents". Can you be more specific?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-22:
Well, did it look like the file was ok? Was it corrupted in any way? Anything to indicate problems during transmission? Etc.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-22:
Apparently, there were no problems with the file, it was OK.
Comment by AlexRibeiro on 2019-06-22:
And, about the "launchpad-getkeys", I couldn't install, the errors that happened were extremely similar to the one I'm getting with ROS Melodic... It's appearing to be very likely that it's a bigger problem im my Ubuntu...
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-22:
Have you tried the live-usb / install-usb already?
