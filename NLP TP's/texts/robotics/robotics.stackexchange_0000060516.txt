Q:

no 'executable' file generated?

Hi all
I have a package called "kinectueye" and a node called "kinect_ueye.cpp".
whent I compile it I get this message:
Built 39 packages with 0 failures. 

means that no error but when I want to launch it I get this :
Couldn't find executable named kinectueye below /home/jros/kinectueye

when I check the bin file I don't find the executable file.
What going wrong !?
