Q:

Multi-touch support for RVIZ visualizer

Hey all,
I am trying to visualize maps on RVIZ on a touch screen display with multi-touch support. Rviz visualization window doesn't seem to support touch. The only thing i can do it rotate, pinch zoom or pan doesn't work, even though the gesture recognition is turned on in the OS.
I was looking into the tutorials, for rviz, and the rviz::VisualizationManager allows only mouse events and not touch events. Is my understanding right, is there any way around it??
Any ideas for panning and zooming the maps are appreciated.
I am using ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
Thanks

A:

There is no built-in touch support in RViz right now, but it is an Ogre application, so I would suggest looking for information on (multi-)touch support there.

Any ideas for panning and zooming the maps are appreciated.

RViz is a mouse-driven application, so if you can somehow convert touch events into mouse events (clicks, drags, wheel, etc), that should allow you to work around the current limitations.

I haven't tried it yet, but I think Touch√©gg [1] would work for converting touch events into mouse events in RViz. You can choose which mouse events are triggered by the touch events. I'll try in a month when I will have my touchscreen shipped.

I finally tried it, and it works pretty well with touchegg!

Hey Julien, I am trying to get this to work now on RVIZ. I have downloaded touchegg, but I keep getting an error message when trying to use multi-touch for rviz.
Gesture begin detected
Gesture information:
Fingers: 2
Type: PINCH
Direction: OUT
Gesture performed on app: rviz
No action configured for this gesture
Ignoring this gesture. This could mean no action is configured, the configured action is not supported or that it was performed in a system window (panel, dock, desktop, etc)
I have even went into the touchegg.config file and added this code, but still this will not work in Rviz. Adding code in next comment because it was too long

enter code here 
  <application name="rviz">
    <gesture type="PINCH" fingers="2" direction="IN">
      <action type="SEND_KEYS">
        <repeat>true</repeat>
        <modifiers>Control_L</modifiers>
        <keys>KP_Subtract</keys>
        <decreaseKeys>KP_Add</decreaseKeys>
      </action>
    </gesture>

    <gesture type="PINCH" fingers="2" direction="OUT">
      <action type="SEND_KEYS">
        <repeat>true</repeat>
        <modifiers>Control_L</modifiers>
        <keys>KP_Add</keys>
        <decreaseKeys>KP_Subtract</decreaseKeys>
      </action>
    </gesture>
  </application>

Actually, I now have it working using the code above. Touchegg says that two finger pinch is working when I try to zoom in and out on rviz, but it does not actually zoom in and out on rviz? Any Ideas?

If I remember right, I couldn't make the two finger pinch work for zoom in or zoom out, but it did work with two finger swipe up/down for zoom in/out, this was my touchegg configuration :
<gesture type="DRAG" fingers="2" direction="UP">
      <action type="SCROLL">SPEED=7:INVERTED=true</action>
</gesture>

<gesture type="DRAG" fingers="2" direction="DOWN">
      <action type="SCROLL">SPEED=1:INVERTED=true</action>
</gesture>

I am trying to use rviz with touchegg as well. I noticed the same as rbukovec, zoom in and zoom out works when I use two fingers swipe up/down. In addition, I noticed that whenever I touch the screen with one finger, the rviz with change to another viewpoint, a totally undesired behavior. I have no idea what causes this. Lastly, I am wondering if it is possible to use 2D Navi Goal tool in rviz?
