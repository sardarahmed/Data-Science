Q:

error when using catkin_make_isolated

I use command catkin_make_isolated in the terminal, error is shown below:
    CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:111 (FILE):
      file INSTALL cannot set permissions on
      "/home/gupta/catkin_ws_2/install_isolated/lib/libuwsim.so"
make: *** [install] Error 1
<== Failed to process package 'uwsim': 
  Command '/home/gupta/catkin_ws_2/install_isolated/env.sh make install' returned non-zero exit status 2
Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/gupta/catkin_ws_2/build_isolated/uwsim && /home/gupta/catkin_ws_2/install_isolated/env.sh make install
Command failed, exiting.

A:

Does the user your using have a write access at /home/gupta/catkin_ws_2/ and subsequent folders?

@rayane Please ask somewhere else because 1) That's not related to ROS at all 2) There can be a number of different  ways to do so depending on your particular situation.
