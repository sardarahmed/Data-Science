Q:

roscd: command not found (in groovy 12.04)

rosbash is installed but the following gives :
$ roscd
roscd: command not found

This initial command from the rosbash wiki page returns:
$ source ${ROS_ROOT}/tools/rosbash/rosbash

The version of the package is :
$ dpkg -s ros-groovy-rosbash

A:

The comment on the rosbash wiki page was outdated. I have updated the wiki page.
The correct way is to source /opt/ros/DISTRONAME/setup.bash instead of the rosbash file. This will not only give you bash-specific completions but also the correct environment variable like ROS_ROOT, ROS_PACKAGE_PATH etc.
