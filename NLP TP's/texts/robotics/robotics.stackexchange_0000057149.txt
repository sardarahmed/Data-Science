Q:

Image visualization does not work in Rviz [?]

Hi, I was trying to visualize a sensor_msgs/Image message using Rviz and had no success. Then, I found image_viewer plugin in rqt (rqt_image_viewer) and the image was always there. Is this an issue in Rviz? Do I have to report it as a bug? or Do these tools work in different ways?
P.D.: I'm using Hydro on Ubuntu 13.04

I've seen this on OS X, and just assumed it was an OSX bug. Are you seeing it on Linux as well?

Yes @ahendrix, I'm running Hydro on Ubuntu 13.04

This sounds like an rviz bug, then. I'll open a ticket.

A:

I'm fairly convinced that this is a bug in rviz and I've opened a ticket about it: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/719
