Q:

Configuration of pcl with cmake

I am new to pcl and cmake..
So here am stuck in installation of pcl in linux_ubuntun14.04 ..
I had downloaded the pcl_master.zip from github. Besides I had also installed pcl through terminal sudo apt-get pcllibaries....
While trying an example it showing the following error..
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPCL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "PCL", but
  CMake did not find one.
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PCL" (requested
  version 1.2) with any of the following names:
    PCLConfig.cmake
    pcl-config.cmake
  Add the installation prefix of "PCL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "PCL_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "PCL" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Thanks for your patience and happy to follow your great suggestions....

A:

There are several ways to install PCL, the first solution is to install the last release using ROS repositories:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pcl-ros

You could also install PCL with the PPA for Ubuntu but in fact this is how PCL is installed when you install PCL-ROS package.
If you need the bleeding edge version of PCL you have to compile it yourself using PCL trunk. You want to compile PCL when you need features not included in releases/PPA (CUDA, surface module etc.) or you use something that has been improved/fixed into PCL repository but not in a release yet.
When installed through ROS/PPA, the CMake files are located in
/usr/share/pcl-1.7/PCLConfig.cmake
/usr/share/pcl-1.7/PCLConfigVersion.cmake

If you build and install (default CMake prefix) PCL from source the cmake files are located in
/usr/local/share/pcl-1.8/PCLConfig.cmake
/usr/local/share/pcl-1.8/PCLConfigVersion.cmake
