Q:

Robot semantic description not found

I am not able to use this command on baxter. :
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("left_arm") 
gives error: RuntimeError: Group 'left_arm' was not found.

The website tutorial of baxter claims that  The SRDF is generated dynamically at runtime and then loaded to the param server under robot_semantic_description. But, I am getting the following error:
 [ERROR] [1490907690.019375241]: Robot semantic description not found. Did you forget to define or remap '/robot_description_semantic'?

I am able to see 'rosparam get /robot_description', but there is no rosparam as /robot_semantic_description

I'm getting this same error message using a Turtlebot 2 with a PhantomX Pincher, the turtlebot_arm repo and the pick_and_place.py demos...

A:

short answer:
did you forgot to launch move_group.launch !?
long answer:
Answering in a  robot agnostic way, because this can happen not only with Baxter but with other robots as well...
The srdf file is autogenerated by moveit setup assistant and located under my_moveit_config_pkg/config/my_robot_name.srdf
It gets loaded into the parameter server by the file my_moveit_config_pkg/launch/planning_context.launch
specifically in the line :
<!-- The semantic description that corresponds to the URDF -->
  <param name="$(arg robot_description)_semantic" textfile="$(find my_moveit_config_pkg)/config/my_robot_name.srdf" />

So if /robot_semantic_description param is not found in param server most probably you forgot to launch move_group.launch interface (that calls planning_context.launch), another possibility is that you have modified manually the moveit automatically generated files or probably is being pushed under a namespace (do rosparam list | grep robot_semantic_description to check)

Shouldn't it be /robot_description_semantic? (i.e. description followed by semantic)
