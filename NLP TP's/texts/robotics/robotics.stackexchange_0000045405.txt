Q:

Error compiling libfreenect stack

Hello all,
I am currently trying to rosmake the freenect_stack Piyush is maintaining. I downloaded the drivers on the desktop in the lab and they compiled fine. However, when I tried to compile on the laptop in the lab rosmake gave me the following errors (specifically in the libfreenect stack):
 [rosmake-0] Starting >>> libfreenect [ make ]

Does anyone know what these errors are from? Thanks for all the help with these compiling issues.
Kind Regards,

A:

The package has not compiled locally on your machine, so the the launch results in the above error. Try the system package ros-fuerte-freenect-stack. See http://www.ros.org/wiki/freenect_stack
