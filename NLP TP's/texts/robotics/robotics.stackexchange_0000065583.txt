Q:

Hydro Ubuntu 12.04 and Stage - Can't open roomba-world

Hi, I'm using hydro and Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm trying to follow this tutorial. I downloaded stage_controllers, but when I try to launch the world this is what I get. Can anybody help me? From another question i read that maybe there's a problem with the lasers/rangers terminology, but  from there I couldn't find a solution. I'm sorry I'm very new to ROS and I'm trying my best.
    rosrun stage_ros stageros stage_controllers/world/roomba-wander.world 
 [Loading stage_controllers/world/roomba-wander.world]
err: Model type laser not found in model typetable (/tmp/buildd/ros-hydro-stage-4.1.1-6precise-20140819-1748/libstage/world.cc CreateModel)
err: Unknown model type laser in world file. (/tmp/buildd/ros-hydro-stage-4.1.1-6precise-20140819-1748/libstage/world.cc CreateModel)

Hi,Can you tell me where the code is it,Because I can't find the code from the address(http://mobotica.googlecode.com/files/stage_controllers.tar.gz ).Thank you!

A:

I didn't look at the code, but I think roomba-world map file should be updated, changing laser model to ranger model.
Here is an example of this modification on another map file, maybe you could try something similar:
