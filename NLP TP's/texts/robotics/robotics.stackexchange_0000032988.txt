Q:

Is it possible to download packages from the build farm?

Many of the packages are built at http://build.willowgarage.com/ before they are pushed to the repositories.
Is it possible to get the output debs of these builds?
(If not I'll probably file an enhancement request.)

A:

According to the release architecture here:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/release/Architecture

The Hudson builds are in the release pipeline; the last stage of which before being released publicly is:

http://packages.ros.org/ros-shadow-fixed/

EDIT by kwc: ros-shadow-fixed may not have a completed set of packages, so it's use is not recommended.  If you do fetch from ros-shadow-fixed, you will have to update your entire set of ros-* debs at once as the debians are version-locked for binary compatibility.

I recommend that you read http://www.ros.org/wiki/release/Architecture if you're interested in the definition of what is contained there.

Is it in fact always the latest from the build farm though?

caveat emptor: they are held there before going public for a reason.  You may find yourself with incomplete or broken packages if you regularly use that repository.
