Q:

What are good beginner packages for object avoidance?

Hi there,
I'm using ROS for a class project, but I'm very much a beginner, so I'm still getting adapted to the libraries and packages and all. I intend to use this package ...ros.org/wiki/cob_collision_velocity_filter?distro=groovy to use as the foundation for object avoidance; however, I'm unsure if that's a better start than building object avoidance from the ground up. The robot on which I'll use the code has a kinect, laptop camera, and proximity laser. I don't know how well the packages will match up. I'd like your suggestions on what I should try first so I won't have to invest too much time in a chicken egg or something over my head. Thank you!

A:

I think the standard navigation stack should do the trick.  (http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials).  I think it's difficult enough getting all of the navigation pieces working together, it's probably best not to re-invent the wheel, especially when you're just starting.
