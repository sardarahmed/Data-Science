Q:

Definition of message field type frame_id std_msgs/Header?

What values are possible for the message field frame_id in std_msgs/Header messages? From the message type definition it is not clear to me if it is allowed to be "0" and "1" or "no frame" and "global frame".

A:

Any string value is actually valid.
The comments on the field in the msg defs are wrong / confusing: I believe that 0 and 1 were valid values way-back-when, but very quickly it was realised that they actually don't make much sense (what does "the global frame" actually mean? etc).
These days valid values are strings, and those strings are supposed to be TF frame names (but that is not enforced anywhere (I'm also not sure how that would have to be done)).

I think rviz maps the messages based on frame_id matching the tf frame name. This is sort of enforcement if you want to use rqt

That would not be just RViz, but the general purpose of the frame_id.
But that is at best implicit, and not enforced anywhere (ie: invalid values are not rejected, they'll just result in problems in consuming nodes).

I do not care about rviz here. The answer given is exactly what I was looking for. Thx.
