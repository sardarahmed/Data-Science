Q:

add srdf file to gazebo empty_world

I would like to simply load a srdf file to Gazebo instead of an URDF file. I followed a simple Gazebo tutorial that instructs me on how to launch an URDF file using the following commands:
Terminal 1:
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

Terminal 2:
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file `rospack find robot_pkg`/urdf/MYROBOT.urdf -urdf -model MYROBOT

This spawns the robot in Gazebo but not without fidgeting completely (possibly due to self-collisions) and jumping 1000 ft in the air. So I am trying to load a SRDF file instead with the following commands:
Terminal 1:
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

Terminal 2:
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file `rospack find robot_config`/config/MYROBOT.srdf -sdf -model MYROBOT

When I hit enter on Terminal 2, the following occurs:
SpawnModel script started
[INFO] [1503422995.443726, 0.000000]: Loading model XML from file
[INFO] [1503422995.444003, 0.000000]: Waiting for service /gazebo/spawn_sdf_model
[INFO] [1503422995.444960, 0.000000]: Calling service /gazebo/spawn_sdf_model
[INFO] [1503423005.472383, 16.663000]: Spawn status: SpawnModel: Entity pushed to spawn queue, but spawn service timed out waiting for entity to appear in simulation under the name kr500

Then Terminal 1 reads
Error:   No link elements found in urdf file
     at line 180 in /build/urdfdom-UJ3kd6/urdfdom-0.4.1/urdf_parser/src/model.cpp
Error [parser_urdf.cc:3408] Unable to call parseURDF on robot model
Error [parser.cc:340] parse as old deprecated model file failed.

What doesn't make sense is why the tutorial tells me I should be able to simply load up a SRDF file. I looked over the parameters to run on the terminal and they appear correct. Only terminal 1 should be calling parseSDF not parseURDF. Maybe this is my problem. But I'm not instructed on what commands to run so any further knowledge on the command to load a SDF file would be helpful.

A:

.srdf != .sdf.
srdf files are MoveIt Robot Semantic Description files. sdf is Gazebo's Simulation Description Format.
Those are not related and you cannot load an srdf file in Gazebo.

I don't believe it actually tells you that SRDF is supported.

This spawns the robot in Gazebo but not without fidgeting completely (possibly due to self-collisions) and jumping 1000 ft in the air.

One thing to check is that you have your robot linked to the world frame using a fixed joint.

Adding the world frame helped me take a step towards a more stable robot. But I'll be attempting to fix other joints that are misbehaving
