Q:

In what situations or problems would I use KDL data type in tf?

Is KDL used by tf to do transforms or is it a supplement to explicitly do transforms by the programmer instead of letting tf do it?  Please forgive my ignorance I've been trying to get a better understanding of tf but am confused by KDL.

A:

TF and KDL can achieve somewhat similar, but somewhat different uses. TF does not use KDL internally.
TF is frequently used when you just want to transform data from one coordinate frame to another.
KDL can also be used to find where a particular frame is based on a kinematic chain and joint positions, but doesn't offer the convenient functions for transforming sensor data. KDL does however offer kinematics functions such as Inverse Kinematics, Forward Kinematics, Jacobian calculations, etc.
