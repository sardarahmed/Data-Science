Q:

ROS2 Multicast - can't see any topics

Hi!
I'm running ROS2 Dashing on my Raspberry Pi inside a docker container (Balena) on Ubuntu 18.04, here are the packages installed:
ros-dashing-ros-base  
ros-dashing-slam-toolbox   
ros-dashing-navigation2   
ros-dashing-nav2-bringup

I'm running only one node at the moment - rplidar which publishes LaserScan data to /scan topic.
Here is how I start the process:
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash; source ./install/setup.bash; ROS_DOMAIN_ID=45 ros2 launch rover rover.py

Then I'm trying to get a list of nodes on my Ubuntu machine running ROS2 Eloquent (maybe this is the problem?):
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=45 ros2 node list

which gives me
/launch_ros
/rplidar

So far so good.
But when I'm trying to get a list of topics I get only the default ones:
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=45 ros2 topic list

/parameter_events
/rosout

Is there a step I'm missing?
I followed the "Troubleshooting" section here: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Troubleshooting/  and multicasting are enabled on both Ubuntu PC and on Raspberry Pi.
The fact that I can see remote nodes is also encouraging.
Is it just version incompatibility or I really need to run the same version on Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu?
Cheers!

A:

It was the incompatibility between Dashing and Eloquent which makes sense.
After compiling Dashing on my Ubuntu 19.10 and running:
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=45 ros2 topic list --spin-time 30

I can now see
/parameter_events
/rosout
/scan

I'm also able to visualise the scan data with Rviz:
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=45 rviz2
