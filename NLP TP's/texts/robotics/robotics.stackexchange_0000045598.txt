Q:

"pr2_tuck_arms_action" for pr2

After I run my pr2, I use this command to let his arm close up.
  rosrun pr2_tuckarm tuck_arms.py -r t -l t

But if I make a launch file like this
  <launch>
  <node pkg="pr2_tuck_arms_action" type="tuck_arms.py" name="tuck_arms" output="screen"/>
  </launch>

It couldn't work at all! Why?

A:

The equivalent launch file for that command would be
<launch>
   <node name="tuck_arms" pkg="pr2_tuckarm" type="tuck_arms.py" args="-r t -l t"/>
</launch>

Since that these two are not the same, what's the function of ""? What should I see if I execute these launch file?
