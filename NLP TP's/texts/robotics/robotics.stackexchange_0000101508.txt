Q:

ros2 launch fails after following some tutorials

ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py works fine.
colcon_cd PACKAGENAME to ~/dev_ws/src/PACKAGENAME works fine.
colcon build --packages-select PACKAGENAME works fine in ~/dev_ws.
I have that in ~/.baschrc
export _colcon_cd_root=~/dev_ws
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1
export ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
export ROS_VERSION=ros-foxy
export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh

What to check why ros2 launch PACKAGENAME.launch.py would fail ?

A:

solved..
a package install was missing for one of mine under ~/dev_ws/src.
After installing that ros2 launch works fine
very odd as the missing PACKAGENAME was the one I have created.

How did you create this package? Maybe you missed a step in its configuration

@ljaniec that is very probably the case. But how to fix such a problem I would have hoped for some hint during the start or a log to look at...

I think rosdep should help you here with additional dependencies in your workspace

that's the ros1 documentation. but thanks for the hint

Rosdep is used with ROS2 too: https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html#install-dependencies-using-rosdep, https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/How-To-Guides/Building-a-Custom-Debian-Package.html?highlight=rosdep, https://answers.ros.org/question/310728/rosdep-and-ros2/
