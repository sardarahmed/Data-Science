Q:

[Kinect] About sound streaming

Hello,
I want to know if there is any libray that allows ROS to stream over the web the microphone of the kinect, something like the web_video_server.
Update:
Navigating through the forum I found the library audio_common, it is posible to generate an audio stream from this library and the rosbridge Websocket?
Thanks beforehand!

A:

If you expand the main idea of audio_common tutorial out of the localhost space, you are able to stream sound.
