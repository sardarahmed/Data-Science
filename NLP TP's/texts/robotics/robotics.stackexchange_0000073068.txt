Q:

ros buildfarm: package build failed because include not found

Hi,
I submit my package into the ros buildfarm. It can be compiled successfully on local machine and in travis-ci.org
But in ROS buildfarm it says:

Command failed, exiting.  Project
'dji_sdk_lib' specifies 'include' as
an include dir, which is not   found.
It does not exist in
'/tmp/catkin_workspace/install_isolated/include'.

However, there is a include dir in my package https://github.com/dji-sdk/Onboard-SDK-ROS/tree/3.1/dji_sdk_lib
So I'm puzzled and wondering how to fix this error? Is it caused by I didn't specify a install parameter in the CMakeLists.txt?
the overall log: http://build.ros.org/job/Idev__dji_onboardsdk_ros__ubuntu_trusty_amd64/1/console and
error message shows in 00:03:48

A:

Your package does not specify any installation rules; so when the build farm tries to install your package, it fails.
Have a look at the catkin documentation and in particular the documentation for building and installing C++ libraries

thanks @ahendrix I will fix it. 1. Do all released packages need to specify a install parameters? 2. When one pkg needs another one as a library, the buildfarm also said it failed cause cannot find the library package, is it the same problem? i.e. no install parameter in the library package

Of course. 2. Very likely.

The best local testing prior to building debs is to use catkin_make_isolated --install to validate you have setup install rules. And use the install space instead of the devel space.
