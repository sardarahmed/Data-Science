Q:

dynamic_reconfigure

I'm trying to:
rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui

in following the instructions here to configure my kinect:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_camera
however, the gui window that comes up is blank?! (no controls or fields, unlike what is shown in the example on the link above).  Any idea what could be going on?  I'm able to run rviz and have qt4 installed.  I'm running on diamondback with ubuntu 11.04.
Thanks,
Walt

It sounds like you have an independent problem with your Kinect.  I suggest that you ask that with more details in a seperate question after looking for similar problems from other users.

It looks like there is a problem with the openni_node working correctly.    When I do this:
