Q:

Changing robot initial pose in gazebo

I'm trying to modify the initial pose by changing pr2.sdrf (pr2_description/robots). after rerun: roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch, the robot pose remains the same as the original one.
I have no idea where to look for make the proper changes. Any idea would be appreciated. Running on fuerte 12.04 ubuntu precise.
Thanks.

A:

In pr2_no_controllers.launch they make use of "optenv ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE". So, setting that env variable should change the location. Or you could modify the pose used with the spawn command in your own launch files.
Looks like a duplicate ..

I have a look to the that post, but when I try to execute move_arm_joint_goal, errors stating that kinematic has experienced conflict with the initial pose. Do you know what packages that I need to modify (to generate) so I can build my own? Thanks
