Q:

Check if target joint position is valid

Hi,
I was wondering if there is a way to check if a goal pose of a planned path (planned in moveit with OMPL) is a valid pose, meaning that joint position constraints, collision, etc. are taken into consideration.
A Python function like

bool check_if_pose_if_valid(joint_position)

would be great.
Thanks for your answers

A:

The easiest way should be to use the StateValidationService of the move_group node, by calling the service /check_state_validity with this message. You will need the RobotState, which you can get from the /get_planning_scene service with this message.
In the definition of the StateValidationService, you also find a pretty good example of how to do the checks yourself, in case you want to avoid calling the service too often.

Thanks a lot for you answer. I will try to test the ''/check_state_validity'' service and mark this question as answered if it works for me.
