Q:

Can't run rxgraph on remote slave computer when connect to pr2

When I connect to pr2 and set the ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_MASTER_URI, I can  and retrieve the list of currently running nodes. Besides, the simple node I wrote can execute successfully on my slave computer. I think these mean that the connection is correct. However, I just can't open rxgraph. The rxgraph window only show "initializing". Any suggestion? Thanks~

A:

Did you connect to your robot using ssh? Did you enable X-forwarding, i.e. ssh -X? You should also connect directly to the second computer, i.e. don't ssh from c1 to c2 if you want to have X forwarding enabled.

How can I open a window when I ssh to the robot in the terminal? My current method is to use multi- machine and try to open rxgraph in the slave computer, but failed.

With X-forwarding, you can run gui applications through ssh when you use X-forwarding. Please read the support page and be more specific. What did you set ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_MASTER_URI to and on which computers. Which errors did you get.

After connect my laptop to PR2's LAN, I type:(in laptop)
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.68.0.1:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=10.68.0.142(get from ifconfig)
And then I try to open rxgraph in my laptop, the window of rxgraph remains "initializing".

Don't set ROS_HOSTNAME but ROS_IP. I doubt that this is the cause of the problem though. Try rosnode list and try executing rosnode info <node name> on one of the listed nodes to verify that your network connection is really working.
