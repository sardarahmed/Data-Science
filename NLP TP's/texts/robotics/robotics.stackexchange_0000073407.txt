A:

This is explained in the Installation tutorial, section 1.6 - Environment setup (here from the Jade tutorial):

It's convenient if the ROS environment variables are automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched:

echo "source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc

Note also the warning:

If you have more than one ROS distribution installed, ~/.bashrc must only source the setup.bash for the version you are currently using.

If you just want to change the environment of your current shell, you can type:

source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash

Btw: sourceing is never 'permanent'. It will always only update the shell in which it was invoked.

It does not work, there must be some error in the syntax.

If you're using a different ROS release, you'll have to update the command and replace jade with whatever ROS release you're using.
