Q:

Building a 3D and 2D map with RealSense and RTABMAP

Hi to all,
I am very new to Ros platform. I'm trying to build a 3d and 2d map with RealSense r200.  As far as i know the rtabmap doesn't have a standalone driver for RealSense r200. I tried several things but couldn't managed to make it work.
Could you please explain the steps and provide the commands that can help me to reach my goal?(also maybe launch files)

A:

Try this:
$ roslaunch realsense_camera r200_nodelet_rgbd.launch
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch depth_topic:=/camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect_raw

I've managed to run it with these command set btw:

roslaunch realsense realsense_r200_launch.launch
rosrun resize_image resize_image -i /camera/depth/image_raw -o /camera/depth/image_resized --aw 640 --ah 480
roslaunch rtabmap_ros rgbd_mapping.launch ... ( subscribed topics )

well, make sure that /camera/depth/image_raw is registered with the RGB image.
