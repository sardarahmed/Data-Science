Q:

How to use mit-ros-pkg without ni?

I try to use mit-ros-pkg (finger detection/minority report interface) under Ubunt11.10, ROS Electric, but it won't work.
Since this package said in its doc that it would work under Ubuntu 10.04, ROS DiamondBack, So I installed these on another PC. But the package uses NI for kinect driver, and I can't download ni.rosinstall, the file does not exist anymore.
I think the finger detection feature is pretty useful, so I want to know how to use this package under electric & openni? or, if it's too hard to transfer it to electric, please tell me how to use it

A:

As the ni wiki page indicates, the ni stack has been replaced with:
http://ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect
However, there's been a lot of development since the original mit-ros-pkg demo was written, so you will likely have to port the code appropriately to handles changes to the OpenNI and PCL APIs.

Thanks for your answer. I'd like to modify the code myself, but before I do that, I want to make sure that nobody does it before. Do you happen to know the content of ni.rosinstall ?

ni.rosinstall just contained the (outdated) ni stack.  Thus, all you need to replace it is the openni_kinect stack, though the APIs have changed.
