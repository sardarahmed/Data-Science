Package OGRE was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `OGRE.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable

  Add the installation prefix of "map_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "map_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "map_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

A:

Looks like you are trying to compile rviz from source. Why? You appear to be missing the map_msgs package, upon which rviz depends. There are 29 rviz dependencies, and you probably need them all.
