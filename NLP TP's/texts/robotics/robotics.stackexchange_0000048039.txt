Q:

error in image_pipeline

Hi,
Today i tried to get the OpenCV 2.4.3 (With CUDA 5.0) working with ROS Fuerte.
After i successful compile the OpenCV and test it i tried to compile a ROS program, but every program i compile (that uses the kinect) gives me this
make[3]: Entering directory '/home/joao/ros_workspace/sandbox/kinect_icp/build'

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

This is with and without using the Opencv.
I also uninstall the Opencv 2.4.3, restart the pc and noting. I still get the same error...
Did i mess up with ROS or there was an update (that i didn't notice) that broke this?
How can i solve this?
Thanks
Edit:
I re-install every thing (even linux) and its the same thing.
On a fresh install its every thing OK. This time i installed CUDA 4.2 and PCL 1.7 (ros version) and now this happens again. So i'm  inclined to say its a problem related to CUDA (the common thing between the two "experiences")
I installed CUDA according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cuda

A:

could be using namespace issue. Did you build your opencv directly with ROS in the CMAKE?  I experience something similiar before for error: undefined reference with openc v+ ros to some 3rd partry library. It turns out opencv shares couple library with ros. say boost under cv::boost and there is another ros::boost. of course your system gets confused.
I think to solve this. One is to build opencv not with ROS. So when you use it remember not to use using namespace cv;   but use every function as cv::boost.....
If above not working just remove opencv and compile without ROS and try it again

I re-install every thing including Linux itself and it seams to be related to the CUDA. booth CUDA 4.2 and 5.0
