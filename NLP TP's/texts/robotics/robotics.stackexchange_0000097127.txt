Q:

sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlebot3* dont download models for simulation

I am running on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal using ROS Foxy.
Following the tutorial on navigation stack (https://navigation.ros.org/getting_started/index.html), one step is to enter the command:  sudo apt install ros-foxy-turtlebot3*
It seems I cant download turtlebot3 models for simulation. As a result, gazebo shows an empty world without the turtlebot.
Also checked the share folder used in the command GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/foxy/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models but could not find it.

A:

Got this problem solved by following the instruction on this link (https://ubuntu.com/blog/simulate-the-turtlebot3).
After cloning the turtlebot3 repo and build the turtlebot3_ws using colcon, I added it to the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH and ran the simulation.
