Q:

Has anyone added breadcrumbs to gazebo?

I think I saw it listed as a feature for next version of ignition, but I am looking to add breadcrumbs to gazebo-11. Has anyone ever done this? Any ideas on how it would be possible?
By breadcrumb, I just mean a line that follows robot and shows its past path.

You could clarify what aspect of breadcrumbs you're talking about. Is it just models that can be dropped from another, or also the communication aspect and so on.

I mean just a line that follows the robot to see where it has moved during a simulation.

Oh for that, try LinkPlot3DPlugin.

Just for future reference, this is different from what we've been referring to as "breadcrumbs" on Ignition. In that case, breadcrumbs are physical models that can be spawned and dropped behind; they can be moved, picked up and so on.

Close, but I need the line to be displayed in 3d viewer. Not just a plot.

Yeah that's on 3D, as the name says  Here's a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egWAMbU7f6Y
