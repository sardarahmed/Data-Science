Q:

how do you synchronize rviz publishing?

All the code examples I see online use a clock with a time guesstimate for rviz to finish loading before sending markers by publishing.
Is there a better way to tell when rviz has finished loading than sleeping for xxxxseconds?

A:

You don't link to any of the examples, but I'm guessing that what they're really waiting for is for the topic setup to finish, and for rviz to be subscribed before they start publishing. (particularly because rviz is often running before the marker node starts)
The other typical way to do this is to wait for at least one subscriber to be connected to your topic. There are methods on the roscpp and rospy publisher objects to get the number of connected subscribers.
