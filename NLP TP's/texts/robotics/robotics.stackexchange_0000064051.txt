Q:

How can I get the kinect pose with rgbdslam v2

I am working with rgbdslam v2 to make the turtlebot navigate in door, so I want to get the pose of kinect. I have get the trajectory of camera, but I didn't find out how to get the rotation of the kinect.

A:

If you want it online, you can subscribe to /tf and use the transformation between /map (or whatever you use for the parameter "fixed_frame_name") to the frame of the kinect (/openni_camera or /camera_link).
The trajectory file has the following format:
timestamp x-position y-position z-position quaternion-x quaternion-y quaternion-z quaternion-w

The timestamp is the typical unix stamp in seconds, positions are in meter, rotation is a normalized quaternion.
For example:
1305033527.670034 0.002149 -0.002778 0.000684 -0.001445 -0.000679 -0.000384 0.999999
