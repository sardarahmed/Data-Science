Q:

what to do on the PR2 robot simulation?

So I ran the line
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch
So now I have an empty world and spawned a pr2 robot.
How would I go about making the robot do something? For example waving? Do I just type commands in a new terminal? Very new to ROS :(
Thanks

A:

I would start with the PR2 Simulator Tutorials (follow the tutorials link on the pr2_simulator wiki page ).
The PR2 simulator has been around for a long time, and gazebo has changed a lot since the tutorials were written. If you encounter something which doesn't work the way the tutorials say it should, ask a new question and the community will probably help you figure out how to update the tutorial.
