Q:

openni_kinect installation issues with configuration

Hi, I have ubuntu 10.10. I am encountering the following errors when i try to install openni-kinect. It says that
ros-diamondback-openni-kinect is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
4 not fully installed or removed.
After this operation, 0B of additional disk space will be used.

When say yes to this. I get the below error.
I see that openni-dev, nite-dev, ps-engine and ros-diamondback-openni-kinect are depended on each other. I followed the instructions in http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect which says New in diamond pack. So i am not sure if the configurations are to be done in packages or in my end. Can somebody tell me how to configure (i see this is the only problem) them so as to complete my installation. Thanks in advance.

A:

This should just work - I'm guessing that something got out of sync on your machine somehow. I would remove those packages, sudo apt-get update, and reinstall ros-diamondback-openni-kinect.

Ya, I did open another question, but forgot to update the same here. Here is the link to another question http://answers.ros.org/question/2411/kinect-not-detected

You should open another question, also search for that solution elsewhere.  I know there are other questions with that error already.

This solution only solves the Errors encountered in the question but does not help in getting started with Kinect. I see "No devices connected" error when i try to launch the openni_node.launch file.

I found some solution in this link "http://groups.google.com/group/openni-dev/browse_thread/thread/bcd013333abc9553/c307a8edcdaa5648?lnk=gst&q=Not+able+to+register+modules+#c307a8edcdaa5648" where creating ni folder before installation in /var/lib/ helps niReg.
