Q:

rviz segmentation fault in electric, deb package

I am facing segmentation fault in running rviz (version 1.6.7-s1338538703) in ROS electric on Ubuntu. Installation is done using deb packages.
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/visualization/rviz$ rosrun rviz rviz

Segmentation fault

How I could avoid it? Is anyone facing this problem ?

A:

Have you looked at troubleshooting rviz? It is likely you just need to set OGRE_RTT_MODE
The relevant section says:

Various OpenGL or Ogre things can go
wrong during startup. One of them
seems to relate to the
render-to-texture system. Ogre
supports 3 different modes, and rviz
uses the "PBuffer" mode by default.
Some users have reported some modes
cause a segfault during startup, but
it is not clear which should be used
when.
If you have a problem and want to try
another "RTT mode", run rviz with the
environment variable OGRE_RTT_MODE set
to either "Copy", "PBuffer", or "FBO".
For example:
export OGRE_RTT_MODE=Copy
