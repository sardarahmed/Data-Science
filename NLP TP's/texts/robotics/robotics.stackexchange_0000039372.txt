Q:

rxplot is not plotting

Hi all,
I'm trying to plot some states of the pr2 robot. the command line is exactly
rxplot /r_arm_controller/
However, all I get is a plot screen that comes up with no data being plotted. Is there any remedy to this? Thanks in advance

Are you sure messages are being published for that topic? What does rostopic hz /r_arm_controller say?

A:

You have to give rxplot the name of the fields you wish to plot.  In the above, you are just giving the topic name.  See the rxplot documentation:
