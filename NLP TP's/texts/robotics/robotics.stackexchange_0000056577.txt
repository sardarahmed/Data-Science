Q:

Hector Slam with Odometry

Hi everyone.
I have already used Hector slam (without odometry data) to create a mapping process successfully. But now I want to use odometry data from my mobile Robot with hector slam node.
Is it possible? How can I achieve it? Can anyone share experience in writing an odometry node?
Thank you so much for helping me!
BTW, I am using fuerte 12.04.

A:

You can use hector_mapping with a robot providing odometry (see "Use in place of gmapping" in the setup tutorial). Odometry is not used within hector_mapping though, as in the original use case it was advantageous to be able to perform mapping without reliable odometry.

There will be no improvement in mapping performance by providing odometry data currently. It certainly would be possible to add support, but it hasn't been done so far.
