Problems whie compiling turtlebot packages

Hi, I'm compiling some turtlebot packages and I get this error while compiling turtlebot_self_filter:

  mkdir -p bin
  cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

I algo get a similar error while trying to execute turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch:

[ERROR] [1339682184.543002698]: Failed to load nodelet [/pointcloud_throttle] of type [pointcloud_to_laserscan/CloudThrottle]: Failed to load library /home/turtlebot/ros_electric/turtlebot/pointcloud_to_laserscan/lib/libcloud_to_scan.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_REGISTER_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Cannot load library: /opt/ros/electric/stacks/perception_pcl/pcl/lib/libpcl_visualization.so.1.1: symbol __cxa_pure_virtual, version libmysqlclient_16 not defined in file libmysqlclient.so.16 with link time reference
[FATAL] [1339682184.558845604]: Service call failed!

It looks like both things lead to the same: __cxa_pure_virtual@libmysqlclient_16
Some hint on that?
chers!

A:

Try:
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16

If using ubuntu/debian, make sure to check that the update repositories are enabled by checking that /etc/apt/sources.list has:
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-updates universe main multiverse

Or by checking in Synaptic in settings>repositores>updates>recommended updates checkbox.

Worked for me too in a different context. Thanks!

What version of libmysqlclient16 do you have? I've it installed, but still am receiving the dreaded undefined "__cxa_pure_virtual@libmysqlclient_16".
