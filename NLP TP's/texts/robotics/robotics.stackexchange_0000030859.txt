Q:

rviz camera display locked in top left corner of screen

When I add a camera plugin in rviz it appears at the top left of the screen. It is stuck under the application bar and I cannot move it.
When I switch compiz off, I can move it and dock it to rviz and switching compiz back on is OK, so I can then still move it around.
Does anyone know the reason for this or how to fix it?
I am using Ubuntu Lucid with gnome and compiz. The graphics card is a nVidia GT240.
