Q:

Not able to launch kinect on turtlebot ROS fuerte , turtlebot ISO install

Hi,
I installed the turtlebot from the ISO supplied by iheartengineering. I am able to run the keyboard teleoperation but unable to launch the kinect to view on the rviz.
I configured everything properly, the installation automatically detected the IP and assigned to the turtlebot. When I run
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch

I got
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch
... logging to /home/turtlebot/.ros/log/935ee6ec-18f7-11e2-bafc-002163c42ffd/roslaunch-turtlebot-25851.log

I tried to check whether the kinect is detectable from USB
so I ran the lsusb and found
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ lsusb

I see 3 microsoft Corp message so the kinect is fine and getting power. The Irobot is fully charged and the kinect green light is blinking.
Then I thought may be the openni package is not installed so I tried to reinstall the openni ros fuerte package and it says
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-openni-camera ros-fuerte-openni-launch
[sudo] password for turtlebot:

I read some of the replies on the same issue and tried
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ killall XnSensorServer
XnSensorServer: no process found
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ XnSensorServer
Starting sensor server...
Running...
^C

One more thing I am using the kinect for windows and not xbox360 kinect.
Now I am new to ROS and dont know what to do next. Please help me with this problem so that I can start with building some maps and do SLAM.

A:

This is almost certainly related to your Kinect for Windows.  As far as I know, it is still really not supported very well on Linux, and certainly not using standard binaries from ROS repositories.  The only chance you'd have would be to run modified source code for the Kinect drivers.  If you are interested in doing this, check out @GermanUser and @PatrickMihelich on this thread.
Can you obtain/borrow a standard Xbox Kinect to test on?
