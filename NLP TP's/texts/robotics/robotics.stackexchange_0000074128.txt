Q:

Holonomic planner for navigation

Hello !
I want to know how to have a holonomic planner for the navigation of a holonomic or omni-directional robot (KUKA Youbot for example).
The Idea is to be able to move the robot along the y axis without changing its orientation.
I tried to adjust the 'holonomic_robot' value of my planner (dwa planner) to true but the robot continue to not move as I want.
If someone can tell me how to configure my planner in order to do this, I will be very grateful.

Yes, thanks, I tried the eband_local_planer planner and it works exactly as I want, thank you for your help (I forgot this topic ;) ).

I follow your suggestions to use the eband_local_planner, and I use I default parameters as [http://wiki.ros.org/eband_local_planner].And I have a lot tests, and use rqt_reconfigure tool to config the related parameters, but the omnidirectional robots hardly translate in the y directions.
