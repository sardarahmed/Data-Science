Hi @Saracerno! Try to check this post.

A:

You should start by installing openni_launch using sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-launch and then following the instructions for Quick Start on that package's main page. If you are lucky this will work fine. If you are running into errors, I'd then try using openni2_launch. If you are still running into errors, then start searching the internet for your specific errors. There are many people on this site who have asked about a variety of different errors, and many of the questions have several debugging steps that you can try. If you get nowhere with this, then come back here and post what you've tried, and what errors you are getting. Unfortunately the functionality of these devices can be somewhat finicky, and many systems behave differently even with the same drivers and devices. That being said, I am usually able to find some combination of driver version and specific port where I can get everything working.
