Q:

Setting port for hokuyo laser range scanner

Hello
I have written the following launch file:
<launch>
  <node
    pkg="mark_pi_navigation"
    type="mark_pi_navigation.py"
    name="mark_pi_navigation"
    respawn="true">
  </node>
  <node
    pkg="hokuyo_node"
    type="hokuyo_node"
    name="hokuyo_node"
    respawn="true">
    <param name="port" value="/dev/ttyACM2"/>
  </node>
  <node
    pkg="razor_imu_9dof"
    type="imu_node.py"
    name="imu_node" >
    <param name="port" value="/dev/ttyUSB0"/>
  </node>
  <node
    pkg="rosserial_python"
    type="serial_node.py"
    name="arduinoLeft"
    respawn="true">
    <param name="port" value="/dev/ttyACM0"/>
  </node>
  <node
    pkg="rosserial_python"
    type="serial_node.py"
    name="arduinoRight"
    respawn="true">
    <param name="port" value="/dev/ttyACM1"/>
  </node>
</launch>

I am experiencing some issues with setting the right port for the hokuyo LRS. If I change the port to ACM0 (in launch file and physically) it works without problems... However it timeouts when trying to run from a different port.. I'm I writing the parameter wrong?
Thanks

I've opened an issue about your question title not updating correctly: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/answers.ros.org/issues/129

A:

It looks like you're configuring the port correctly. Are you certain your laser is actually represented by that device node?
Note that /dev/ttyACMx devices are created in the order that devices are plugged in; they're not automatically associated with a particular USB port or physical device.

yes I have used the ls -l /dev/ttyACM* command, and found the port names by unplugging the device.

Is there another process running which already has that port open? If there are multiple processes reading from a serial port, often only one of them will actually read data from it, and the others get nothing.

sudo lsof /dev/ttyACM1 may be able to get a list of processes which have that device open.
