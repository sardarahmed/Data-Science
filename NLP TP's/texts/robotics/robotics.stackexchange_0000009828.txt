Q:

Brushless motor from RC car won't spin with even small resistance

I recently bought a RC car kit and after 10 minutes it stopped going. 
When I throttle, I can see the motor trying to spin but it will just grind and get hot quite fast.
The motor does move if I disconnect it from the big gear, but not as fast as it did when new and it will still get very hot. Also, I can stop it with my fingers with a very slight touch.
I don't know anything about motors or ESCs, so I'm not sure if my problem is the motor or the ESC.  Did I burn it out?

A:

A couple of things to check:
First, does the gear assembly work smoothly? If it doesn't, then the motor might have broken when attempting to work against too much resistance.
Second, if you apply a reasonable voltage directly to the positive and negative leads of the DC motor, does it still get hot and not work? If so then the motor is toast.
I cannot imagine that the mechanical issue is caused by the ESC.
