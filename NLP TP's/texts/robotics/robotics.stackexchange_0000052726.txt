Q:

Specify TCP port communication between a ROS node and a none ROS exe

Hello!
I have currently a software which is a black box! I can only connect to it through TCP/IP in localhost port 5000.
My question is very simple : How can I create a node in which I could create a connection to the port 5000 in localhost ? Do you have a sample which do this stuff ?
Thanks

A:

Simple answer: In the same way you would do it with any other non-ROS node. It's just an executable that you program. ROS shouldn't limit you as it's just "some other" connection.
The maker of your box should provide such a sample.
That code should be easy to merge with ROS, in either direction, as ROS is basically just a few method calls and does not replace your main method.
The only thing to look out for is if there are blocking calls involved.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but ROS uses TCP underneath right? In that case, wouldn't there be a chance of a port clash?

Yep, it does. I know what you mean, but I'm no networking expert. As this is no ROS specific issue the internet might know the answer.
