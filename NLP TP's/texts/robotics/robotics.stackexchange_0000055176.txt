Q:

find_package(catkin) fails in Hydro

I am trying to move some packages made in Groovy to Hydro, which I just finished installing. After struggling to convert my previous workspace, I am trying to start again fresh, so following the tutorial I
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
mkdir -p ~/iar_ws_hydro/src
cd ~/iar_ws_hydro/src
cd ~/iar_ws_hydro/
catkin_make

However, when I run the catkin_make command in my brand new folder, it seems to recognize the command and start setting up the workspace, but then fails to find the catkin package. Here's the output:
abouchard@linux-z28r:~/iar_ws_hydro> catkin_make

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:44 (message):
  find_package(catkin) failed.  catkin was neither found in the workspace nor
  in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.  One reason may be that no ROS setup.sh was
  sourced before.

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!                                                                                                                 
Invoking "cmake" failed

I have to confess to being totally lost on this one. Obviously catkin is installed because it recognizes the catkin_make command, and the setup.bash calls setup.sh. $CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH contains /opt/ros/hydro:/home/abouchard/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated, and I can confirm that there are a whole mess of catkin executables in /opt/ros/hydro/bin if that helps.

A:

The problem was that I was building locally and manually moving the contents of the install_isolated directory to /opt/ros/hydro/, with the result that my paths were not properly configured and packages not properly installed. When I wiped out my installation entirely and rebuilt using the --install-space flag, everything worked fine and didn't give any errors.
