Q:

Unmet Dependencies Installing ROS Indigo with Ubuntu MATE on Raspberry PI 2

Hi I'm trying to install ROS Indigo on my Raspberry PI 2 using Ubuntu MATE 15.04, through the following instructions:
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM
However once I got up to installing the ROS communication packages:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-base

I ran the line and it came up with an error:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  Depends: ros-indigo-actionlib but it is not going to be installed
  Depends: ros-indigo-bond-core but it is not going to be installed
  Depends: ros-indigo-class-loader but it is not going to be installed
  Depends: ros-indigo-dynamic-reconfigure but it is not going to be installed
  Depends: ros-indigo-nodelet-core but it is not going to be installed
  Depends: ros-indigo-pluginlib but it is not going to be installed
  Depends: ros-indigo-ros-core but it is not going to be installed

E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

I tried installing each package manually but the first one resulted in another set of dependency errors which highlighted both libboost-system1.54.0 and libboost-thread1.54.0 package dependencies as well as other ros-indigo dependencies.
If anyone can provide any help it would be much appreciated!! Thanks!

A:

15.04 is not a supported target platform for ROS Indigo (see REP 003) so I'd expect this to be the reason for the issues you see. I'd recommend doing a fresh install of 14.04. I have that running on a Pi2 flawlessly.

Thanks! I looked more into it and it turns out there is no 14.04 version of Ubuntu MATE so I'll have to go with Ubuntu Core.
