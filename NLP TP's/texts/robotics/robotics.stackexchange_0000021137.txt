Seen in this story, and in * many * others relating to AI and robots (determined via google image search...)
What build is this and it's origin?

The robot is called Alter. It is part of the robot exhibit at the Miraikan museum in Tokio. It seems from this website, that it has been created by Ikegami Takashi, specially for the exhibit, in order to explore human interaction by mimicking human poses.
