Q:

ROS installation on RPI <== Failed to process package 'urdf':

I'm following these steps http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi for installing ROS Indigo on a RPI3. I keep getting this error below when I compile the package. I've applied the two patches that are recommended in the wiki and tried to verify all my dependencies but nothing helped. Please help.

Please format console copy/pastes using the Preformatted text button (the one with 101010 on it). That will make this much more legible.

A:

When I checked the dependencies I realized that liburdfdom-dev failed to install and that's probably the issue. I'm trying to fix it and I will post the solution if that was indeed the issue.

I got the same failure.  Did you find a fix?
Comment by AloshkaD on 2016-07-07:
Yes I did.I downloaded the liburdfdom-dev and installed it on my system . I had to remove it twice and force install it because I kept getting an installation error.

Hi.  Thanks for your reply!  When I attempted to sudo apt-get install liburdfdom-dev I then ran into another dependency issue... it was complaining about not having the libconsole-bridge-dev dependency.  Did you run into this issue as well?  I really appreciate your help.
Comment by Nate on 2016-07-07:
I ended up doing the same thing you did.  I had to remove both liburdfdom-dev and the console-bridge and rebuild both.  Thanks again for the pointer!

Glad that helped, I was stuck on this issue for 3 days.

Hey guys. Can anyone tell me the command used to remove this dependency? Thanks in advance.
