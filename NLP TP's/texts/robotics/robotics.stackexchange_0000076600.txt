I don't know which hardware u have, but there a few packages for differential drive: http://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller
And for Arduino boards you can use this one : http://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller

A:

You might try the differential_drive package. The twist_to_motors node might be what you are looking for. It takes an input Twist message (by default on the twist topic, which you will probably want to remap to cmd_vel) and computes and publishes motor speeds on two outgoing topics.
If you want to try that package, get it from the author's GitHub repository rather than the code.google.com location from the ROS. The GitHub location includes changes I submitted to the author to update the package for indigo and later.
