Q:

After execution Call back function program doesnt return to orignal execution?

Suppose I have following program :
Global Variables
void  main (..)
{
  declared nodes.. and stuff

  while(1)
  {
      do X stuff.. 

      publish a topic..
  }
} 

void callback()
{
    process data.. 
}

I am not able to publish a topic, after first call back is called.. Is it some error in my code or, I am missing some return statement.. ?
Actually am using Odometry Sample Program and have linked it with roserial program. So the only modification to sample odometry program I have made is that have added a subscriber and a callback method which sets vx vy etc variables... The problem is the odom and base_link frames no longer exists.. ? I dont know whats wrong :(

We need more details. Do you call ros::spin or ros::spinOnce anywhere? Could you generate a minimal example that has the same issue or post your code?

A:

If you are asking about doing callbacks in ROS, use ros::spinOnce() instead of ros::spin() in your while loop. See this tutorial: link text

The odometry sample program mentioned above did not call ros::spinOnce(). It should, so I fixed it.
