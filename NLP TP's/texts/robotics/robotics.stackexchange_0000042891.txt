A:

First, you should understand the basics of ROS, what nodes are, what topics are etc. Have a look at these tutorials. If you need C++ example code, have a look at the source code of turtlebot_teleop.
The implementation is pretty simple: when you want to move the robot, publish a message of type geometry_msgs/Twist on the topic cmd_vel.

Have a look at the android repository on rosjava.googlecode.com. Maybe you find something there. But be aware that rosjava is not released yet and its API is highly unstable and might change in the future. Not all apps in the android repository might still be working.
