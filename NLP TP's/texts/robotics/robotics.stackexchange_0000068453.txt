Q:

import in rosgraph/masterapi.py failing

Hi,
I am getting an error in the rosgraph/masterapi.py file.
I am trying to run the turtlebot_arm_bringup arm.launch from answer17 and am also using their arbotix package.  I am using these packages as they appear to provide support for the pincher arm I am using.
I am using Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04, with Python 2.7.6.
The error I get is:
$ roslaunch turtlebot_arm_bringup arm.launch 

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/indigo/bin/roslaunch", line 34, in <module>

from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy  # Python 2.x
ImportError: cannot import name ServerProxy

So it looks like python can find xmlrpclib.py (so don't think it's a PYTHONPATH issue) but I'm not sure why it can't import ServerProxy (it exists in this file).
Any ideas on what is going wrong?

A:

Turns out a few of the ros commands were missing (when I uninstalled a Turtlebot package using sudo apt-get install it deleted some other packages and was perhaps the cause of this...).
