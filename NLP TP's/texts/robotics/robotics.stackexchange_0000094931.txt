Q:

Show full rosparam filepath

When running a node with roslaunch and loading filepaths into the rosparam server, the terminal output clips the end of the filepath as shown:
PARAMETERS
* /driver/transforms_path: /home/matt/rosdat...
* /driver/alg_settings_path: /home/matt/rosdat...
* /driver/settings_dir: /home/matt/rosdat...
* /rosdistro: kinetic 
* /rosversion: 1.12.14

How do I force ROS to show the full, unclipped filepath? Seeing the full path makes debugging faster and easier.

A:

You can't, as it isn't supported.
The code which prints the summary (as that's what it's called), is here. Notice how max_length is hard-coded to 20.
You could consider proposing a PR (similar to ros/ros_comm#1655) which adds a command line option for this.
