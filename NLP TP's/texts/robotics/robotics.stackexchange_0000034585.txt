Q:

Turtlebot amcl demo, using map-files from selected directory?

map files created with the turtlebot 'SLAM map building' tutorial are stored in the /tmp/ directory. I have tried moving the generated files to my home directory and the run the 'amcl-navigation demo' pointing to the files in this directory but the map-server does'nt seem to accept this. How can i store and reuse different mapfiles?
roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/turtlebot/freja02.yaml

A:

as @tfoote pointed out, the command should look like:
roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/home/turtlebot/freja02.yaml

Also, make sure your .yaml file points out the right location of .pgm file. Suppose you have freja02.pgm also in the home directory, you might want to something like:
emacs freja02.yaml &

This will open a text editor, then correct perhaps the 1st line where describes the path of .pgm file as:
image: /home/turtlebot/freja02.pgm

then save file by Ctrl-s (pressing control key and s). Close the window, and run the .launch file again.
