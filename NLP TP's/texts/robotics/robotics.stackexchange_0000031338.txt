Q:

Running cob_script_server my_script.py

Hi all..
I've been following closely the cob python script tutorial on this site.
However, I always get this error when i run it:

rosrun cob_script_server my_script.py

/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/cob_apps/cob_script_server/scripts/my_script.py:
line 5: syntax error near unexpected
token 'cob_script_server'' /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/cob_apps/cob_script_server/scripts/my_script.py: line 5: roslib.load_manifest('cob_script_server')'

Can someone tell me what is going on and how can i fix this?

A:

As it is a syntax error I suggest you copy-paste the source into your question.
I also notice you seem to be editing files in /opt/ros when you should work somewhere in your home directory. Create a directory somewhere in your home and add export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/the_dir_you_created:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to the end of your ~/.bashrc.
However, this is probably not the source of the problem.
