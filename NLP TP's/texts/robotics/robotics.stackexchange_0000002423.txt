Q:

What do quadcopter propeller specifications mean?

I'm trying to figure out the diameter of tri-blade propellers.
I found a 7x3x4.5 blade, I'm trying to understand the measurements. Is the '7' the length of the blade giving the prop a 10.5" diameter? or is the 7 the total diameter?

A:

7 is diameter of propeller in inches and 4.5 is pitch of propeller in inches. 
Unless mentioned, propeller parameters are mentioned in inches. The Pitch of a propeller is distance covered by the propeller in one full rotation hence measured in inches. This is similar to pitch of a screw.
