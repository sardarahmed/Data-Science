Q:

rosdep is not installing pip dependencies

Hello, I have a package perception with the following in package.xml:
<exec_depend>open3d-pip</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>pyrealsense2-pip</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>python-opencv</exec_depend>

The first two are packages I've added myself here: https://github.com/luisrayas3/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/python.yaml which is included in sources.list.d:
$ cat /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/10-luis.list
yaml https://github.com/luisrayas3/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/python.yaml

And in fact this does seem to not be the issue:
$ rosdep resolve pyrealsense2-pip
#pip
pyrealsense2

But rosdep does not try to install them:
$ rosdep install --simulate --reinstall perception
#[apt] Installation commands:
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-ros-base
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-image-common
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-image-transport-plugins
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-catkin
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-vision-opencv
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-perception-pcl
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-laser-pipeline
  sudo -H apt-get install ros-melodic-image-pipeline

On a whim I have tried to change the dependencies to <depend> without luck.
Additional info:

Ubuntu 18.04

ROS melodic

All help appreciated.

A:

There is already a ROS package named perception : http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=%5Eperception%24
The list of dependencies rosdep lists seem to match that package's dependencies: https://github.com/ros/metapackages/blob/d2de28a9b2ce4878102bbb0258bb3cc437fa67ba/perception/package.xml#L18-L27'
Can you try to change the name of your package?

Thank you! That was indeed causing the problem.
