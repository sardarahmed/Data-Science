Q:

'hector_trajectory_server' not found

Hi everyone,
I am unable to find the hector_trajectory_server package in the /opt/ros/melodic/share/ path. And when I run :
rosrun hector_trajectory_server hector_trajectory_server

I get the error :
[rospack] Error: package 'hector_trajectory_server' not found

Is there a way to install this package?
