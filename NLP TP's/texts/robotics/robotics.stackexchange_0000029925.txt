Q:

cancelGoal crashes if called before any goal has been sent

cancelGoal crashes if called before one goal has been sent.
OpenPRS comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
[ERROR] [1298889427.632366743]: Trying to cancelGoal() when no goal is running. You are incorrectly using SimpleActionClient
[ERROR] [1298889427.632673206]: Trying to cancel() on an inactive ClientGoalHandle. You are incorrectly using a ClientGoalHandle
Segmentation fault

if you send at least one goal, then it just reports the problem but keep running.
[ERROR] [1298889509.884434617]: BUG: Got a transition to CommState [PREEMPTING] when in SimpleGoalState [DONE]

Is this normal? should I fill a ticket?
(I know, it is stupid to cancel something which does not yet exist... but it should not crash.)
Just to add that cancelAllGoals behaves better and does not crash. It does not even report any error.
By the way, where are the source for these functions (cancelGoal and cancelAllGoals), I cannot find them in my ubuntu virtual box appliance.
