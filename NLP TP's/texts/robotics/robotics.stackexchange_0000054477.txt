Q:

Adding ROS install tutorials

I went through the process of building ROS Hydro from source on Debian and recorded to process for wiki material. I just created an account with the ros.org and it seems like I don't have the kind of privileges to go about making a new page. I had tried to edit yesterday and accidentally overwrote the install page, someone noticed it before I did and it has now been fixed. How do I add a page and link it to the Hydro experimental install section correctly, is this even how I should be contributing this material?

A:

That would be a great contribution.
To create a new wiki page, go to the URL while logged into the wiki and it will say "Page Not Found" but there is a link to "Create New Empty Page" which if you click will allow you to edit it.
For your convenience I commented back in the debian link on the hydro Platforms page Just put your tutorial where it links.
