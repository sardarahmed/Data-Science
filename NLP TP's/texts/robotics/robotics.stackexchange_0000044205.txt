Q:

Incorrect laser_geometry PointCloud2 fields

The current laser_geometry package fails to set the 'count' members of sensor_msgs::PointCloud2::fields in projectLaser(). When using PCL 1.6 (not 1.5!) this causes incompatibility when converting PointCloud2s created from the laser package to native PCL pointclouds.
I wouldn't mind sending in a proposed patch sometime later but it isn't exactly spelled out how to go about contributing to official stacks.

Could you please clarify what you mean by 'count' field?  Is it missing a 'channel', such as x or intensity?  Are the settings for point.step or row.step incorrect?  Are the height and width incorrect?
Comment by jdlangs on 2012-09-18:
It's the 'count' member which is within each channel. (http://ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointField.html)  If it's not set, it defaults to zero, and pcl 1.6 assumes non-zero counts in each channel.

A:

If you submit a ticket at code.ros.org and attach the patch, the maintainers should integrate it eventually.

Do ros answers credentials work there?

No, you must create a separate account.
