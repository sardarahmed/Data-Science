Q:

Rosserial and Arduino resets

I'm having an interesting issue with rosserial. When uploading some arduino code, for example Hello World , and running:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0

I am able to connect with no issue.
If I upload the same code, but unplug and plug back in the arduino hardware before running rosserial I am unable to connect. And only see a repeating:
Lost sync with device, restarting...

I have made sure that the hardware is actually still on the correct serial port. Something about the arduino losing power is changing how it is able to communicate....sounds crazy I know. Has anyone else seen this issue?

Could it be a USB thing? Is the Arduino IDE still connected and rosserial can't access it? Just blindly guessing.
