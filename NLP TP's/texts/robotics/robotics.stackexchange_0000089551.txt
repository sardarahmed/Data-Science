Q:

My package added to shadow-fixed repository with bloom is installed into a wrong path

Environment

OS: Ubuntu 16.04
ROS distro: Kinetic
bloom version: 0.6.7
catkin_pkg version: 0.4.9
rosdep version: 0.12.2
rosdistro version: 0.6.9
vcstools version: 0.1.40

What I'm working on
I've just added my created package timed_roslaunch into shadow-fixed repository according to bloom turorial.
Recently merged rosdistro/kinetic/distribution.yamlrelated to timed_roslaunch is here.
I firstly tested sudo apt install ros-kinetic-timed-roslaunch after switching repository from ros to ros-shadow-fixed by referring to ShadowRepository Wiki Page and the install command was successfully completed.
What's wrong
However, the package files were installed into directly under / not opt/ros/kinetic/
For example, launch files in gazebo_ros are installed as the following directory configuration.

/

opt/

ros/

kinetic/

share/

gazebo_ros/

launch/

On the other hand, in case of timed_roslaunch, launch files are installed as follows.

/

launch/

Also, I directly download and checked deb package named ros-kinetic-timed-roslaunch_0.1.1-3xenial-20181107-003648-0800_amd64.deb from ros-shadow-fixed repository to find the launch directory is already set ot just under root /.
This causes any ros commands such as roscd, roslaunch and so on cannot find timed_roslaunch even after source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash 
I want to change the install directory from / to opt/ros/kinetic/ same as gazebo_ros.
Do I have to change anything when I use bloom? Does anyone know how can it be fixed?

A:

That sounds like your CMake is installing files to the wrong location. Looking into your repository it seems you have short tried to fix the problem in this commit:: https://github.com/MoriKen254/timed_roslaunch/commit/6b98f7723d4d154298511a1845438d9a07a6eb3a
But since then you haven't released a new version yet (the commit is one after the 0.1.1 tag). Therefore I would suggest to create a release 0.1.2 and run bloom for that one. The new Debian package might already look better.

Thank you so much. I didn't realize my fixing CMakeFile wasn't applied to 0.1.1. I released 0.1.2 n will let you know if it succeeds.
BTW I don't get yet why copying dir fails like https://github.com/MoriKen254/timed_roslaunch/commit/6b98f7723d4d154298511a1845438d9a07a6eb3a?diff=split before the fix
