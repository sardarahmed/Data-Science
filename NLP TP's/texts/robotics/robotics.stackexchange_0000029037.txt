Q:

Bounce in Ignition/DART

What is the appropriate way to set bounce in ignition?
I've successfully set bounce in gazebo by setting the restitution_coefficient, threshold and max_vel parameters.

But these same parameters don't seem to work in ignition/DART

Is bouncing not supported in ignition, or is there some additional setting that is required?

Unfortunately, this is not yet supported in ignition. I have created an issue for it in https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/issues/84

Thanks! Just wanted to make sure I wasnâ€™t missing something obvious

This has now been fixed in Ignition Citadel. https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/pull/139
