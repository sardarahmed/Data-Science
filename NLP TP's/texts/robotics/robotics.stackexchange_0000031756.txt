Q:

openSUSE and log4cxx

I'm trying to install ROS on a Lenovo X200 Tablet running openSUSE 11.3. I've been through a few iterations already trying to make sure that I have all the dependencies in order, etc. I'm following the instructions on the ROS website to the letter.
Versions:
gcc: 4.5.0
cmake: 2.8.1
Python: 2.6.5
I'm at the stage where I use rosinstall to download and install everything. Here's the command I've been using: rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no"
Things only seem to go awry with regard to the packages, so that's the output I will include here:
#Packages
sudo zypper install python-yaml log4cxx-devel
}}}

I'm not sure that anything else would be much help, but let me know and I will provide what I can. I've been looking for log4cxx to install it manually, either from a package or from a source, but with no luck either way. Thanks for any help you can offer!

A:

Alright, I think that I have it figured out. I'll amend this post if I try the tutorials and something breaks, but for now rosinstall completed successfully.
It turns out that there are dependency conflicts in a number of the modules that ROS uses. For instance, mercurial requires python=2.6, but python-setuptools requires python=2.7. My solution was to install Python 2.7 and every time that the configuration management threw an error I chose to go ahead and install, which it would say was breaking the installation.
