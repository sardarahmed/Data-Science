Q:

Simple yet effective angular position sensor to be used in robotic hand

What is the best yet simple to use angular position sensor? I am building a robotic hand and I want to implement this sensor at the joints of the fingers. I don't need a module, just an analogue output.
Thank you.

A:

Another popular rotary sensor is the ratiometric Hall effect sensor.
Use a device like the A1324. It's a 3-pin device which gives an analog voltage proportional to the magnetic field strength. For a magnet, you have two options:

A diametrically polarised ring magnet mounted on the steering column. The sensor should sit at the circumference of the magnet, facing the centre.
An axially polarised button magnet. Mount it on the steering column with its diameter colinear with the rotation axis.

As the magnet rotates, the output of the sensor changes sinusoidally. If you get the strength of the magnet just right, you can have very nearly a 5v output swing. However, since the output is sinusoidal, you won't be able to measure more than about 120ยบ with good resolution.
