A:

In order to access the data from the quadrotor, the asctec_proc node provides a number of topics that you can subscribe to to get the desired information. A description of all of the topics can be found here. To see them in the terminal, you can use 'rostopic echo /mav/imu' or the equivalent.
In order to get this information into a Java program, however, you must be running rosjava. Rosjava will provide you with access to these topics from Java. You can find some tips on installing here. You can then use the rosjava API to access the information you desire.
I hope that you find this useful. I can provide more specific examples of using rosjava if required.
