Q:

Reset a sub world in gazebo world

Say I have a bunch of sub worlds in gazebo, is there any way to reset a particular sub world?
Here is what I mean, assuming I have 4 sub worlds in gazebo:

How do I reset, say, sub world number 2 without resetting the other three?

A:

Each world has its own control topic where you can publish to reset it.
For example (from the terminal):
gz world -w default -r

or
gz topic -p /gazebo/default/world_control -m "reset {all: true}"

Thank you for answering! So there is a way to spawn multiple worlds in the same gazebo simulation?
