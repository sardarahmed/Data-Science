Q:

why my Python code is running?

I playing alot with :::ROS and I realize this:
I can modify my Python app and start it again by doing:

$rosrun mypkg mypython.py

no need to go back to catkin workspace and do catkin_make
but if I do that (catkin_make) everything works too...
then what is the sense behind the catkin_make command

A:

You can for sure run the code iwthout making it  since that is python (a script language) BUT:
if you are using messages and services you will need a new autogenerated python code...
look the doc in the ros page
3rd parragraph

We use CMake as our build system and,
yes, you have to use it even for
Python nodes. This is to make sure
that the autogenerated Python code for
messages and services is created.
