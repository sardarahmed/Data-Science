Q:

Robot_state_publisher dies on ARM-based Turtlebot

Whenever I run roslanch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch I get the following error:
[robot_state_publisher-2] process has died [pid 1597, exit code -11, cmd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/robot_state_publisher/robot_state_publisher __name:=robot_state_publisher __log:=/home/odroid/.ros/log/02472614-0afe-11e5-884e-c22209f25fe8/robot_state_publisher-2.log].
log file: /home/odroid/.ros/log/02472614-0afe-11e5-884e-c22209f25fe8/robot_state_publisher-2*.log

The log file is empty, however. If I run rosrun robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher I get a segmentation fault. When I compile and run robot_state_publisher using gdb, here's the seg fault info:
Starting program: /home/odroid/catkin_ws/devel/lib/robot_state_publisher/robot_state_publisher 
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libthread_db.so.1".

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xb660bc74 in ?? () from /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libpcre.so.3

I'd imagine this is because I'm running everything on an Odroid U3 with Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo Ubuntu ARM. Anyone else have this issue?

Hi. Im using Jetson TK1  and facing the same problem. Did you get out of it? please help me.

A:

Robot state publisher has died error code -7 and turtlebot apt-get update has generated an error on minimal.launch are probably related.
