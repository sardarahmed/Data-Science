Q:

roscore hangs up in the middle

I`m quite new to ROS and Linux, I need to use ROS to communicate between VICON system and Crazyflie. When I tried to run the rosrun, it works but hangs up in the middle at started core service [/rosout] . I wait for 15 minutes but there is nothing new. Could you tell me what is happening? Here is what actually happens on the terminal console:
pi@pi-desktop:~$ roscore
... logging to /home/pi/.ros/log/1e8ee47c-1945-11e7-8cfb-b827eb1fc882/roslaunch-pi-desktop-2196.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

started roslaunch server http://pi-desktop:43110/
ros_comm version 1.12.6

SUMMARY
========

PARAMETERS
 * /rosdistro: kinetic
 * /rosversion: 1.12.6

NODES

auto-starting new master
process[master]: started with pid [2209]
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://pi-desktop:11311/

started core service [/rosout]
^C[rosout-1] killing on exit
[master] killing on exit
shutting down processing monitor...
... shutting down processing monitor complete
done

My Ubuntu version is 16.04 and I'm using ROS Kinetic. Actually, I downloaded an image with ROS pre-installed on this website of germanrobot http://www.german-robot.com/2016/05/26/raspberry-pi-sd-card-image/ as suggested by ROS for my Raspberry 3.
Thank you.

What are you doing and what do you expect? Like others have said, roscore doesn't do much in the foreground and you're not going to see much happening. It sets up the infrastructure for your system. You'll see stuff happening when you run other nodes.

In other words, roscore is doing exactly what it's supposed to, there's no problem.

A:

Roscore, same as rosnodes are applications, in linux, you are starting those in a terminal windows, those can be abruptly terminated by doing on the focus gained terminal Control+C  I see in the windows you are doing that
check this line

...started core service [/rosout]

until that line everything was ok, roscore was runing as expected... but then you do:

^C[rosout-1] killing on exit

...[master] killing on exit

so you are actually killing the roscore

I'm facing the same issue. So do you mean that after running roscore, the console will just end up with showing "started core service [/rosout]"? If so, how do I give further command to my raspberrypi?
