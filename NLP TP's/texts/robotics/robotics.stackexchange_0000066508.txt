Q:

pointcloud_to_laserscan rotation of scan line

I am running pointcloud_to_laserscan . When I display the pointcloud2 in rviz after rotation  the camera frame is displays correctly along the rviz ground plane. However the laser from pointcloud_to_laserscan produces a scan line that does not register to the cloud2 in rviz .

A:

This is probably due to you not providing pointcloud_to_laserscan with a target frame. Camera frames are differently oriented (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#suffix-frames). Pointcloud_to_laserscan projects the pointcloud onto the x-y plane, so if the camera frame is used, the laserscan will end up 'vertical'.

The point cloud comes from the depth points from the gazebo kentic plugin which is converted to  a scan line with a target frame of  rrbot/camera_frame which is the same frame the riviz point cloud2 is using to display the voxel image. You can see both in the images.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-22:
Yes, and the camera_frame is oriented differently than you may expect (z-forward, x-right, y-up). pointcloud_to_laserscan will try to output a laserscan on the x-y plane, which is why it's 'upright'. Use a body-oriented frame (x-forward, y-left, z-up) such as 'base_link' as the target frame.
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-22:
OK...tried to reset the target frame in PtoS and get this error which I do not understand
Can't transform pointcloud from frame rrbot/camera_frame to camera_frame_optical  with tolerance 0.01

This means there's a problem with your transform tree. Post the results of rqt_graph.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-22:
If you have a camera_frame and camera_frame_optical, then camera_frame should hypothetically be fine to use as a target_frame. You want to avoid using frames that use the _optical convention.
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-22:
I have updated the problem statement to include additional data.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-22:
Looks like you have a weird prefixing thing going on. Your pointclouds are coming in with frame "rrbot/camera_frame", but your tf tree contains "rrbot_camera_frame"
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-22:
I saw that but assumed it was how it handled the display was not an issue. I does find the frame and processes it with rotation on the static transform which is displayed correctly in rviz.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-22:
It looks like there's an issue with how you've setup your transforms/gazebo plugins. Take a look at https://github.com/husky/husky_simulator/blob/indigo-devel/husky_gazebo/urdf/accessories/kinect_camera.gazebo.xacro.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-22:
Your _optical frame should be rotated (-1.5708 0 -1.5708) relative to all its parent links, and your camera and kinect plugins should be publishing data in the optical frame.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-22:
Your pointcloud_to_laserscan node should have a target frame that's 'normal' as in x-forward, y-left, z-up, such as base_link,
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-23:
The plugin belongs to Gazebo ros. If I use the "rrbot/camera_frame" which is rotated as you suggest and produces the correct visual in rviz after rotation does not produce the correct laser output. Are you saying that this is a plugin issue?
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-23:
No I'm saying you should a) correct your naming conventions, as _optical frames are the rotated frames, b) use base_link for your target frame, c) correct your tf naming issue as that may be causing the message filter in pcl_to_ls to fail
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-23:
I weather I use optical or not it does not make a difference since it is just a convention. I tried using base_link as you had suggested but it does not fix the issue. I am not using the (as yet to be determined) bad tf name since I am using the camera_frame_optical now which does not have this issu
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-23:
I believe there is something else going on and I am going to take this to pcl_to_laser issue board.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-23:
What frame are your pointclouds coming in on? Please check with rostopic echo.
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-23:
depth points are coming in on  topic "/depth/points"/.  If I leave off the target_frame then defaults to rrbot/camera_frame in the scan output but  rotation is incorrect and or depth is not right.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-23:
The issue so far is pretty straightforward - even if by some miracle rviz manages to visualize your pointcloud, rrbot/camera_frame and rrbot_camera_frame are NOT equivalent frame_ids, and this will cause issues. Fix your transform tree, and then use base_link as your target_frame.
Comment by rnunziata on 2015-03-23:
rrbot_camera_frame is not a real frame , it does not show in tf, nor is it a valid link name.  It is generated as rrbot/camera_frame by gazebo kenitic plugin. going to write my own pcl translation and force rotation.
Comment by paulbovbel on 2015-03-24:
It's the frame that shows up in your transform tree.
