Q:

Changing pixel size of camera

Hello,
how do you change the pixel size of a URDF camera?
I follow the tutorial in Gazebo but it doesn't say how to do this.
Thx so much friends.

A:

You'll need to use SDF.
If you have to use URDF, then you'll need to add a gazebo extension to URDF that specifies an <image> <width> and <height>.

I did that and I got a bigger image. But does that change the size of the pixels? I don't want to change the size of the image I want to change the size of the pixels. I want better resolution by having smaller pixels

Camera resolution is the number of pixels in the image, which is specified by  and . The "size" of pixels is a concept for print and display on a monitor. For example, a digital camera has a resolution but you can't set the "size" of the output pixels.
