Q:

Using ActionServerWrapper to run actionserver writtten in cpp

I have a actionserver written in C++. I want to run this actionserver using actionserverwrapper in smach. Is this possible? Or  we have to write the actionserver in python itself?

A:

I have to admit that I have never used actionserverwrapper but after reading this I understand that it is used to wrap an entire statemachine into an actionserver. I don't think that is what you want to do.
Regarding your problem: It does not matter in which language the action server is implemented. You can just crate an action client in your python smach and call the C++ action server.
If this is not the answer you were hoping for, maybe additional information and code samples would clarify what the actual problem is.
