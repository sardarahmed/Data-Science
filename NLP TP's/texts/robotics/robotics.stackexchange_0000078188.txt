Q:

Significant slowdown on the Raspberry Pi while building cv_bridge

I invoke the command below to rebuild the Catkin workspace:
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/indigo -j2

It works perfectly fine for the first 115 packages or so but slows down to a major extent when it reaches the last few packages. It is obvious that the memory is running out, as I have a whole instance of htop running in another terminal.
I am using the -j2 option to combat this problem. Yet the Raspberry Pi runs out of memory. -j1 option is too slow and takes about two days. One of the solutions in my mind is to simulate a Raspberry Pi on my Arch. I would love to hear some suggestions from you guys.

A:

If you're using a Pi2 or Pi3 you can install Ubuntu and then install ROS through apt: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM ; then you don't have to build from source at all.
If you're doing lots of installations, you can do the build on one Pi, and then create a disk image and copy that instead of repeating the installation.

Can you please ellaborate on one Pi? Using a distro such as Ubuntu would be too taxing on a Raspberry Pi for the applications that I am looking at.

Why do you think Ubuntu will be "too taxing"? I've been running Ubuntu for quite a while and I haven't observed a significant overhead.

It's still a full GUI desktop environment running on the RPi. I selected Raspbian Lite, as experiments show that, it barely uses 78-80 MB of the RAM on the RPi. Also, what exactly did you mean by one Pi

By "one Pi" I mean a single Raspberry Pi (or Pi2 or Pi3).

So I have gone by installing Ubuntu MATE on my Raspberry Pi and it seems to be a lot less hassle. I am still doubtful about this question though.
