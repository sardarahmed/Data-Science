Q:

care-o-bot installation

Hi,
When i tried to install package cob_apps, I have the following problem:
rosdep install cob_apps
No installers found for rosdep [touchscreen], OS version [oneiric].  Rule:
{{{
{'10.10': 'xserver-xorg-input-evtouch', '10.04': 'xserver-xorg-input-evtouch', '11.04': 'xserver-xorg-input-evdev'}
}}}
Please if you can help me to solve this problem.

Thank you for your replay. I use electric ROS version installed on ubuntu 11.10.

A:

The cob_apps stack is deprecated. This means that there is no release for oneiric. The content of cob_apps was spread into cob_command_tools, cob_navigation and cob_manipulation.
