no idea. but maybe you can try catkin_make. copy rgbdslam_freiburg to your catkin home's src sub dir. run catkin_make at catkin home dir

Do you run out of memory? Are you overheating?

A:

Check if you have parallel compilation enabled, e.g. in the environment variable $ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS (also there will be multiple compiler processes in "top" when you run rosmake).
4GB might not be enough if you do compile in parallel, as some very memory hungry template libraries are used.
