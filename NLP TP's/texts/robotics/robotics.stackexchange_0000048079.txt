Q:

reading message once subscribed to a topic

Hi i am new to ROS, i have done the tutorials.
But i am a bit unsure on how to read messages (in code)
If i have a ros node which has subscribed to a topic /LaserScan see bellow
std_msgs/Header header
float32 angle_min
float32 angle_max
float32 angle_increment
float32 time_increment
float32 scan_time
float32 range_min
float32 range_max
float32[] ranges
float32[] intensities
And I am in my call back function, def callback_lidar(data):
how do i access an individual variables, like the list ranges
would i do
array = data.ranges?
I cant create the node an test it out since the lidar node requires a connected lidar.
