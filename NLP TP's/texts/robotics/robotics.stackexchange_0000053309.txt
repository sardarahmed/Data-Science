Q:

android tutorial pubsub don't work

Hi,
I installed rosjava_core and android_core in my ros groovy pc, then i followed the tutorials and i tried the android_camera tutorial app which works fine.
Now i tried the android_tutorial_pubsub app because i must write an app which publish a string but it does't work. I followed this procedure:

$ roscd android_core  
$ android update project --path ./android_tutorial_pubsub/ --target android-17
$ cd android_tutorial_pubsub  
$ ../gradlew debug
$ adb -d install -r ./bin/MainActivity-debug.apk  
$ roscore &
$ rosrun roscpp_tutorials listener

but it does't subscribe to anything. What is the issue?

What about rostopic list? Before running the last command (rosrun roscpp_tutorials listener), "chatter" appears there in the topics list? If so, are you sure that there aren't some kind of network issues?

A:

I resolved. There was an error in the source code, the nodeconfiguration was private, but to comunicate whit the pc must be public. thanks
