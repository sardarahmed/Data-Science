Q:

basic shapes - no subscriber seen in rqt_graph

hi, after I went through the ROS Tutorials for beginners, I started to learn simulator - RViz.
when I went through this page: http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes
but at the last step, the basic shapes does not appear in my RViz's UI. it has been solved at my answer.But I have another question, why there is no listerer subscribed to the topic /visualization_marker? if we use rqt_graph to see it?
I run "$ rostopic echo /visualization_marker" and there exists messages updating at 1Hz. I also attached the screen shot below.
But I have another question, why there is no listerer subscribed to the topic /visualization_marker? if we use rqt_graph to see it?
Thank you for any help!

A:

Solved!
On the Left Pannel: Display Pannel -> Global Option -> Fixed Frame, Set it to: /my_frame
I set the target frame as /my_frame on the view pannel on the rightside, incorrectly.
THX!
