Q:

Error while loading nodelet [/normal_estimation]

Hi!
I'm using ROS Fuerte Beta 1 on Ubuntu 11.10.
I tried to compile pcl_ros nodelets. There were some errors related to old PCL library API, I fixed them. When I try roslaunch Package node.launch I receive next error:
[ERROR] [1334687385.411350875]: Failed to load nodelet [/normal_estimation] of type [pcl/NormalEstimation]: Failed to load library /home/crady/ros/perception_pcl/pcl_ros/lib/libpcl_ros_features.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_REGISTER_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Cannot load library: /home/crady/ros/perception_pcl/pcl_ros/lib/libpcl_ros_features.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3pcl18BoundaryEstimationINS_8PointXYZENS_6NormalENS_8BoundaryEE14computeFeatureERNS_10PointCloudIS3_EE
[FATAL] [1334687385.412377822]: Service call failed!

So, seems that pcl::BoundryEstimation<PointXYZ, Normal, Boundry>::computeFeature(PointCloud) is missing. Where may be problem?

It might help to know the exact roslaunch code you are using.

Some additions: nodelet manager fails to load exactly this nodelet, other works fine. Error says that it missing library that contains this symbol (BoundryEstimation). I assume that somewhere in manifest.xml or plugin.xml for pcl_ros missed this link. But I can't find it for this moment.

A:

Aha! You are using Fuerte. It looks like that version of pcl_ros is missing the libpcl_ros_features.so.
Please file a bug report.

Hm. But I have it in perception_pcl/pcl_ros/lib. In CMakeLists.txt section for this nodelets was commented out, but I uncommented it. http://pastebin.com/cUDg83Kw this is my version of CMakeLists.txt

I see. I noticed it was missing in the Ubuntu pcl_ros binary. That suggests that it was broken somehow and needs some repair for Fuerte. I don't see an open Trac ticket for it.

Thank you @CaptainTrunky! This helped me find the issue with shared objects for features and segmentation. But I get errors when I rosmake pcl_ros after these changes. I have posted a new question - http://answers.ros.org/question/47814/ros-fuerte-pcl-features-surface-and-segmentation-libraries/

It would be great if you could share with us if you faced these issues and how you fixed them. Thank you.
