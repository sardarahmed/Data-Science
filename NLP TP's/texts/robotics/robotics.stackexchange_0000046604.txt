Q:

Duplicate directories in $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable contains duplicate elements.
It's weird, since I was following the very first tutorials step by step. When we were supposed to check that our variable was pointing to the right places, this is what I get:
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
What can be happening? I've checked my .bashrc file and it's right (I mean, it just sources the setup.bash file from the just created workspace.) :S
Thank you very much in advance for your time!

A:

Hi, this is a flaw in the current rosinstall/rosws. It should not impact your work, so you can ignore this. We introduced this in preparation of Groovy.
EDIT: To explain more, the additional path entries come from the setup-file element, which also changes the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
Maybe I'll write a duplicate removal function.
