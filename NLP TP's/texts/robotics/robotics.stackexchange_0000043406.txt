Q:

Anyone can help me in gradle building problem?

I have some compiling problem but just don't know why...... I successfully build some programs before but after I change something, all program just failed. Can anybody tell me what's this problem? very very thankful...

Where: Build file '/home/wildfire/my_workspace/ajpf_ros/build.gradle'
line: 11

What went wrong: A problem occurred evaluating root project 'ajpf_ros'.
Cause: Could not find method maven()
for arguments
[build_3bcu47ed6p0s77r3m7ndupfh7r$_run_closure1_closure3@1ec3c6d]
on root project 'ajpf_ros'.

Try: Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info
or --debug option to get more log
output.

BUILD FAILED
Total time: 4.096 secs

I've checked other program and it seems like not a "gradle building problem". Is this error come from my wrong code? It's just a very simple one extended from tutorial.
The gradle.build is

apply plugin: 'java'

apply plugin: 'maven'

apply plugin: 'application'
mainClassName = 'org.ros.RosRun'

sourceCompatibility = 1.6
targetCompatibility = 1.6

repositories {
  mavenLocal()
  maven {
    url 'http://robotbrains.hideho.org/nexus/content/groups/ros-public'
  }
}

version = '0.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
group = 'ros.my_stack'

dependencies {
  compile 'ros.rosjava_core:rosjava:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
}

 wildfire@ubuntu:~/my_workspace/ajpf_ros$ gradle --version

Please describe in detail what you are doing before getting the error, see http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support

The java code also has plenty of problems, but those have nothing to do with the error you get. Please also run the gradle / gradlew command that you use with --version, and post the result here.

You use gradle 1.0-milestone-3. As the link above says, you need at least gradle 1.0-milestone-5. So your gradle version is just too old. Use the gradlew wrapper from rosjava_core as it says in the tutorial.
You can also get the gradlew wrapper by running:
$ hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava

Anywhere on your disk, and copying the file 'gradlew' and the 'gradle' directory to your project, and then always using that gradlew instead of just gradle.
