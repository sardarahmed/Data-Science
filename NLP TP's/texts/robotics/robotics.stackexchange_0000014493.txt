Q:

Quicktron company - Mobile robots (Equivalent of Kiva Systems?)

Since some months on many websites, I read and I have seen images of the Alibaba (the Chinese e-commerce giant) warehouses. One example is the following article:

It seems interesting and it seems really the same Amazon is doing with its Kiva Systems. The equivalent of Kiva Systems here should be a company called Quicktron but I am not able to find anything about it on the internet. 
Someone of you has any knowledge about this company? A website?
