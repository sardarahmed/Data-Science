Q:

[freenect.launch] is neither a launch file in package [freenect_launch] nor is [freenect_launch]

Hello,
I am trying to get the Kinect working with ROS.
I did the following:
sudo apt-get install libfreenect-dev
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-freenect-launch

Which works perfectly fine.
Then:
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch

I get:
 [freenect.launch] is neither a launch file in package [freenect_launch] nor is [freenect_launch] a launch file name

Even though it installed without a problem.
Can anyone help please?
I am using ROS-Jade if that matters, but
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-freenect-launch

does not seem to exist.

Looking at ros.org/debbuild/jade.html?q=freenect and wiki.ros.org/freenect_launch, it would appear that that package just hasn't been released yet for Jade.

Even though it installed without a problem. Can anyone help please? I am using ROS-Jade if that matters, [..]

Yes, it matters. You installed freenect_launch for Indigo (ros-indigo-freenect-launch), but are trying to use it in Jade. That won't work, as the package hasn't been installed there, as you found out.
I don't use the packages, so I don't know whether this is possible (or what is holding up a Jade release), but you could try building the packages from source in a Jade catkin workspace.

Thank you!
I feel silly now, I will uninstall and install indigo (the version of ROS doesn't really matter to me) and hopefully that will work.
