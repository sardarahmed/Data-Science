Q:

Tutorial ROS enabled model plugin?

Hi,
I'm following the tutorial "Tutorials/1.2/ros enabled model plugin" in order to enable the plugins with ROS, but I have problems when I try to build the code. The CMake throw the following error:
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.7.2
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.7.2
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/gcc -- works

I'm quite new using CMake and the sintax is too complex for me. I don't know why is not finding gazebo package. I'm using ROS Groovy and Ubuntu 12.10.
PD. Sorry I don't know how to give the format to my text.
Thanks in advance.

A:

It looks like you don't have Gazebo installed.  We're only making binary packages for Ubuntu 12.04 at the moment, so you'll need to build from source.
