Q:

Turtlebot teleop running, no response

I have run the following commands...

roscore
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

Everything appears to be working, but when pressing different movement keys (m, n, etc.) there is no response from the TurtleBot (i.e. it is not moving).  When changing the different speeds with the e, q, etc. keys messages are being sent saying that the speeds have changed.  So, I know there is some sort of communication between the terminal and the TurtleBot.
Yes, everything is plugged in correctly and charged.
Please help!

Do you have TurtleBot 1 or TurtleBot 2? I would check also whether something gets published on velocity  topic (rostopic echo /mobile_base/commands/velocity)

Just a side note: If you use roslaunch, you don't need to manually start up a roscore. roslaunch is doing this for you: it starts one, if it can't find a running roscore.

A:

Try using turtlebot dashboard. It will confirm whether communication between robot and laptop has been established correctly or not.
