Q:

How to record bag-file for hector-mapping

Hello everyone,
I've tried to record a .bag-File for creating a map with hector_slam_launch.
A Hokuyo UBG-04LX-F01 is used for this - the datastream is running and mapped to "/scan"
I've no other sensors at the test-system so I used the configuration-params from the Hector-Slamp-Tutorial for using without odom-frame.
The roscore and hokuyo_node are running - what else should be running during recording the bag-file?
If I try to use one of mine bag-files I get the following error-message in the hector_slam_launch terminal:
lookupTransform base_frame to laser timed out. Could not transform laser scan into base_frame.

Maybe someone knows whats wrong with my approach..
Thanks!, Armin

A:

When you use slam, it's going to try to convert the laser scan from the frame_id of the sensor to the base_frame of your robot. As such, you must provide the transformation from your robot's base_frame to the sensor's frame. This can be done with a static_transform if the transformation is static, or a transform_broadcaster if it's not static. Both of these can be found in the tf tutorials.
