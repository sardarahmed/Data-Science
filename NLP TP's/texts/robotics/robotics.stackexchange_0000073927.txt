Q:

creating and building new package like hector_slam

Hello,
I need to modify hector-slam (odom_frame and base_frame) for my situation which is i dont have a robot system i only have lms100 laser scanner. so i know i should create a new package includes hector_slam and modify inside.
I looked and tried before: the create/build a package tutorials. But now i'm a bit confused when it comes to create a new hector_slam package. It includes so many dependencies, different folders like hector_slam_launch, hector_mapping.
should i follow the create/build package tutorials one by one? in catkin_ws when create a package, the name of it should be the same with hector_slam or not?
and when i run  catkin_create_pkg command, should i write 12 dependencies after that command (which i looked dependecies in http://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam)
what is the proper way to follow? or is there another (much easier) way to do that? Like can i use roscp command for copying the files in a new folder and modify them?
Sorry I have a lot of questions in my mind, i hope i can explain myself properly
Thanks, Basak

You most likely don't need to modify the source code. You just need to configure/parametrize hector_slam and possibly run a static_transform_publisher. Look into it and let me know if you get stuck. (I have to run so I can't go into details right now, sorry.)

A:

You dont need to modify entire package and rebuild it, just modifying the launch files and setting proper parameters will do.
Have a look at this project
