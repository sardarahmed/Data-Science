A:

Yes, the default one is sqlite3 and I couldn't find any other too.
There are some docs about development of these plugins though:

https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/blob/master/docs/converter_plugin_development.md

https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/blob/master/docs/storage_plugin_development.md

But they are quite old and probably now just out of date.
