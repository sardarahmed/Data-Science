Q:

Using Bloom to generate binaries for multiple packages

Hi!
I'm trying to use bloom to generate binaries for a repository containing multiple packages that are interdependent. However, I don't want to make the packages public (i.e. push to the build farm and make a PR). From my understanding, this leaves me in a gap within bloom.
Since I don't want the package public, bloom-release isn't an option for me, but just running bloom-generate as explained in this answer doesn't work because rosdep is not aware of the other packages.
Is there a way to bridge this gap such that I can obtain binaries for all my packages without pushing to the build farm?
Thanks

A:

You can use a custom rosdistro: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm/blob/master/doc/custom_rosdistro.rst
That will make sure your packages are in the rosdep database after releasing them. Also you could just have a local rosdep file which defined translations from your package names to the equivalent debian package names. See: http://answers.ros.org/question/50660/custom-rosdep-rules/
