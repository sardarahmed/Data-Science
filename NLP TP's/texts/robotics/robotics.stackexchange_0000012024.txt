Q:

CNC Programming - How to mill diagonal edge of a contour (CNC Simulator Pro)?

Hope this is the right place to ask.. I'm a Mechatronic Engineering student and am having difficulty programming the mill to cut diagonal edges of contours.  I've worked through this tutorial which I understand. The problem I'm having is milling around the outside of the diagonal edge, not on it.  I hope that makes sense. I'm unsure about the tool positioning at the start/end of cut, for example. Can someone explain how to do it? Thanks.

A:

The feature you are describing is called the cutter radius correction. You can activate/deactivate it with the G-codes G40, G41, G42.
These will displace the path with the radius of the active cutter in positive or negative direction.
