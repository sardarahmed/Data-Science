Q:

error: nav_msgs/LoadMap.h for melodic ROS

I am running ROS in Ubuntu 18.04 Molodic for turtlebot2.
I tried to follow the steps from
https://www.programmersought.com/article/85157677089/ and I am up to the step 4: Go back to the workspace directory and compile which is simply just compile it using the following commend.
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
However it suggests I to use catkin_make_isloated as there are error messages of "This workspace contains non-catkin packages in it, and catkin cannot build"
Hence I used  catkin_make_isloated then I get
/home/robot/catkin_ws/src/navigation/map_server/test/rtest.cpp:39:10:
fatal
error: nav_msgs/LoadMap.h: No such file or directory#include <nav_msgs/LoadMap.h>
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
Could anyone help me with it, please? Thank you.

A:

Hi guys, I just fix the issue by redownloading files from the GitHub page. Please make sure your ROS version match the branch name. For example, I am using Melodic so I switch to the melodic-devel branch and then download it.
The GitHub page is https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/melodic-devel
