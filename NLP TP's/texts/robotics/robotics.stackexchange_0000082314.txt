This is not a question, this is a dump of the console output of roslaunch. Please see Guidelines for asking a question and update your post.

i got the solution for it .

A:

roslaunch is trying to tell you that there is a syntax error in your launch file.
If you edit your question and paste the contents of your launch file, we can probably help you find it.
