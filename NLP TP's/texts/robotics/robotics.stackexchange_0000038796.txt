Q:

Basic obstacle detection tutorials using Kinect

Hey,
My name is Kartik and being fairly new to kinect and ros, I was wondering if there were any obstacle detection samples using the kinect sensor that I could have a look at? I'm working with robots from clearpath robotics.
I'm trying to use the pointcloud2 data. I plan to follow the steps:

Write subscriber node to obtain data from the /camera/depth/points node
Process data to be able to detect obstacles based on change in depth values
Integrate that with some movement code to able to move/stop robot in the presence of obstacles.

Any help/guidance in this area will be much appreciated!
Thanks!

Hi,
Basically you are talking about the navigation stack with obstacle avoidance. ROS already has a navigation stack that you can make use of. You may look into http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation and http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Build%20a%20map%20with%20SLAM for using kinect in your navigation and mapping.
Hope it helps
Karthik

Hi, basically I also want to do the same as @kartikrv, but I am using RObotino and Kinect. my robot has no laser sensor. Can you please suggest me how I implement ROS navigation using robotino and kinect?
