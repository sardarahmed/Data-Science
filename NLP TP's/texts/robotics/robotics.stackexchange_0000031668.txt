Q:

Why all pop-up windows can't appear on ROS diamondback?

Hello, all.
Currently I am using "joint_state_publisher" node and "dynamic_configuration" node.
The pop-up window doesn't appear on my laptop but appear on my desktop.
The exact same code well works on my desktop which has Qt 4.7.0 and Qmake version 2.0.1a. Python 2.6.6 Ubuntu10.04, ROS diamondback 1.4.6.
My laptop also has has Qt 4.7.0 and Qmake version 2.0.1a. Python 2.6.6 Ubuntu10.04, ROS diamondback 1.4.6.
Is there anyone who encounter this problem?
Thank you for reading.

Solved!.
The problem was on apt-get diamondback installation.
I installed diamondback through apt-get and something was wrong.
(I have still no idea whats the problem)
Anyway by installing diamondback through source install, "dynamic_configuration" and "joint_state_publisher" is working now.
I hope this is going to help someone.
Cheers.
