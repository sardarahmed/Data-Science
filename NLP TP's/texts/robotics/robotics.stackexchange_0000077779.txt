Q:

ca_driver deploy catkin_make

Hello community,
I try to deploy ca_driver from create_autonomy to multiple devices.
Problem: catkin_make install did not install ca_driver to install-dir.
Bug or feature ?
Any suggestions ?
Thanks
Cheers
Chrimo

A:

This is actually not a problem with catkin_make: the current CMakeLists.txt of ca_driver (here) simply does not contain any install(..) statements.
Running catkin_make install will therefore not install anything, as there are no instructions to do so.
I'd report this to the AutonomyLab people over at their issue tracker.

It would be really nice if you could report this to their issue tracker, as that would make this work for other users as well.

Expect an update to create_autonomy tonight with install rules (with some other small changes I've been meaning to get to as well).
