Q:

How to install ROS on another partition not /opt

I want to install ROS on another partition because my / partition is almost full.
How do I install ROS on the partition I specify on parameters? like /dev/sdc5
I found a similar question but with no answer that tells how to change partitions.

Thank you~

A:

Do you want to install from source or packages?
From packages, you can't really change the path of installation.
The cleanest way I would suggest is to mount your other partition at /opt (unless your already have other things in /opt, then mount it at /opt/ros). Then the installation would reside in /opt but on the other partition.
Alternately you can make a symlink to /opt/ros from your other partition.
From source you can choose any directory you want and then set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH accordingly.
