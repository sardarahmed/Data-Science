Q:

roscore command not found

Hey there,
I installed properly ROS Hydro, and I've been using it for quite a while.
However, after coming to office the next day. I get the following error
zsh: command not found: roscore
This is weird because I am sourcing setup files for both ROS installation and catkin/rosbuild workspaces.
Rosbuild is overlayed with catkin/devel.
Also rosdep is working, and I have all enviromental variables except ROS_ROOT after launching new terminal.
Thought exporting manually ROS_ROOT doesnt help, and when I source manually /opt/ros/hydro/setup.zsh and after rosbuild/setup.zsh or catkin/devel/setup.zsh, I lose all again.
I tried reinstalling ROS, but that didn't fix the problem.
Anyway had a similar problem?, because this sounds really weird to me.

Are you sure you did setup ROS Environment?

A:

It sounds like your workspaces aren't nested properly for some reason. You may want to remove the build and devel folders in your catkin workspace, source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash, and then rebuild it.

I just upgraded from zesty/lunar to bionic/melodic, and removing ~/catkin_ws/devel worked for me
