Q:

Publishing Velocity of Kalman Filtered Clusters

Hello everyone, I've segmented an incoming Point Cloud, applied an euclidian cluster extraction and then associated the data between frames combined with a Kalman filter.
Right now I'm publishing text markers above every object, containing the object id, x and y position.
I wanna publish the x and y velocity ( from the Kalman filter)  aswell , but I'm struggling to find out how.
In Line 780 - 785 I've tried to so so with a geometry:msgs::Twist Publisher, but it doesn't publish anything.
I would appreciate any suggestion and thank you in advance!

A:

I've figured it out! It works with KF0.statePost.at(2) and
KF0.statePost.at(3). The result is PIXEL/second. That's why the values are so small! Now I need to figure out a way to convert it to something useful
