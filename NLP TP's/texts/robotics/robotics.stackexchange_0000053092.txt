Q:

Hardware can do different tasks - how to tell software?

Hi,
imagine a robot that is capable of performing several different, completely independent tasks. The only relation between the tasks is that they are all within a statically defined environment at known locations.
The hardware is designed to drive to the task locations and, using servos and steppers for example, perform the given task.
What's the best way to, using ROS, build up the node graph? What kind of nodes do I need besides the basic lowlevel controlling nodes for each hardware component? What needs to be built on top of that?
Thanks a lot!

Check out Martin's answer to my similar question from a long time ago: http://answers.ros.org/question/12182/controllers-vs-drivers/

That's interesting as well. Will look into it. Thanks a lot!

Have you heard Smach? http://www.ros.org/wiki/smach
If I understand correctly, this may be what you are looking for.
Some terms may be different than what you are used to but see if you can define your nodes as states and turn them into state machines by adding transitions.

That looks really promising at the first glance. I'll have a look at it. Thanks so far!
