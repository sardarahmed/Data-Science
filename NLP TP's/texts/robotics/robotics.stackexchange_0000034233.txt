Any ideas to solve this? Do I need change anything in the SamplesConfig.xml or skeleton.launch?

I've also inserted  in the SampleConfig.xml. But I have the same error [skeleton_tracker-7] process has died [pid 28770, exit code -11]

Note: "process has died [pid 28770, exit code -11]. log files: /home/yuanwei/.ros/log/9cae2868-dddc-11e0-9c14-00256438dd8a/skeleton_tracker-7*.log" --> please check this file (and post it if you need more help).

A:

It's solved now. I just svn checkout http://pi-robot-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pi_tracker. And it just mysteriously worked!
