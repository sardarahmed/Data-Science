Q:

problem with kinect tutorial

Hi,
I'm new to kinect and ROS, and am using Ubuntu 10.10.
After following the instructions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect and http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect/Tutorials/Getting%20Started, I still can not getting any point clouds from the kinect.
From the RVIZ, it says "no message received" for the TOPIC under pointCloud2.
Also, the following error in the console:
+++++++++++++++++
...
[Stream 70] Expected 1748 data bytes, but got 1908. Dropping...
[Stream 70] Expected 1748 data bytes, but got 1908. Dropping...
[kinect_driver-4] process has died [pid 30244, exit code -4].
log files: /home/blurpc2/.ros/log/93cd600e-4130-11e0-99b0-000e7faeafc1/kinect_driver-4*.log
+++++++++++++++++
What did I miss?
Thanks in advance!

Please edit your post and add the following facts.  How soon did it crash?  Immediately? When rviz was started?  What hardware are you running on? What's the contents of the log file called out?

A:

Diamondback is definitely the way to go if you want to use the ni driver.  Cturtle has problems there.  The MIT hand_interaction demo works well with Diamondback, but you do have to get the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH set up properly.
With regard to the question about pointCloud2, use
rostopic list
to see what is being published, then you will know if the topic is there.
