Q:

Openni_launch Quickstart tutorial slightly out of date

As is requested at the top of the tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch/Tutorials/QuickStart), I'd like to report that Step 4 is a little out of date.
The dynamic_reconfigure gui has been changed to rqt_reconfigure's rqt_reconfigure (rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure). The "driver" tag in the left column of the GUI is where the tutorial picks up again.
Other than that, the tutorial was very helpful =)

As the wiki is a community effort, you are welcome (and encouraged) to fix anything you find that is incorrect.
