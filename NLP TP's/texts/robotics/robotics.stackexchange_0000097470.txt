Q:

ros2: is it possible? code, message and action definitions in the same package

I have a package with actions, messages and code.
The code references the action and messages. However there is a compilation error. It looks like the action include files are not found during the colcon build command.
The question is simple: is it possible to use a actions and message definitions from code in the same packages?

A:

Yes, it is possible.
Earlier, I have tested it and it works. However, as stevemacenski suggested in his answer, it is better to keep interface definitions in a separate package.
You need to use rosidl_target_interfaces, if you are on Foxy or Galactic. Please check the following answer for detailed instructions:
