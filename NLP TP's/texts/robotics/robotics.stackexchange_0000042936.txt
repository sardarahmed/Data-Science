Q:

rosserial with arduino NO node!

I have searched the solution for my problem,however i am still puzzled.
below is my problem:
1.I download the examples from the Arduino IDE on my Uno 238P
2.execute :roscore , rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0,
output:
[INFO] [WallTime: 1344165710.415424] [0.000000] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime: 1344165710.434731] [0.000000] Connected on /dev/ttyACM0 at 57600 baud
But, when i list the topics:
/rosout
/rosout_agg
and service list:
/rosout/get_loggers
/rosout/set_logger_level
i have found that others terminal will show :
[INFO] [WallTime: 1342164886.822488] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime: 1342164886.825278] Connected on /dev/ttyACM0 at 57600 baud

[INFO] [WallTime: 1342164888.974499] Starting service client, waiting for service 't
