i am using qt creator but its not detecting .launch extension as xml

A:

The solution mentioned here to use Tools->Options->Generic Highlighter path and copying a file didn't work for me, because that path is just empty.
What actually worked was this:

Going to Tools->Options->Environment->MIME Types
Filter for xml
Click on the entry "application/xml
in The field "Patterns" append ";*.launch" to the already existing patterns
