Q:

Path Message with Velocity?

I know I can create a custom message that includes a velocity with each pose, but I'm curious for input from other developers. Is there a reason it would be detrimental to carry a speed command in nav_msgs/Path?
For context, I've got a machine that's non-holnomic and I've created a path plan. The machine is capable of high speed (20 m/s). As a part of that path following I want to determine safe speeds to avoid mishaps. This requires looking at stopping distances, safe cornering speeds, etc.
I was thinking to add geometry_msgs/Twist velocities to nav_msgs/Path, maybe call it PathWithSpeed? PathWithTwist?
Am I alone in thinking this would be a helpful standard message? Or have I totally missed some other method that would serve this purpose?

Wouldn't a Path with velocities (and/or time, acceleration, etc) be called a trajectory?

A:

Ah, I wasn't looking into the Joint Trajectories as I didn't immediately consider it applicable. I was thinking robot arms, not vehicles.

That would be it!

Please note: a JointTrajectoryPoint encodes the desired state at a specific point in time. It does not encode "safe speeds [..], stopping distances, safe cornering speeds, etc."
