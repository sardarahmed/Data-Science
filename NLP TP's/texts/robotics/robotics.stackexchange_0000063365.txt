Q:

rosrun map_server map_saver keeps on waiting does not generate map

hello, i am Build a Map Using Logged Data. I am following the procedure as explained in the ROS Tutorial click to go.
Here are the steps i am following:-
1. $ roscore
2. $ rosparam set use_sim_time true
3. $ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan
4. $ rosbag play --clock mylaserdata.bag

everything goes fine till here, but at the 5th step while executing following command...
5. $ rosrun map_server map_saver

This displays following message:-
[INFO] [1413492118,722337006]: Waiting for the map

and then map_server keeps on waiting but neither it stops nor save the map, i am wondering why this is happening i can't figure out the problem since there are not any error, the size of my bag file is 5MB.
please help, thanks in advance.

If you watch the map building progress in rviz, do you see a map being built?
