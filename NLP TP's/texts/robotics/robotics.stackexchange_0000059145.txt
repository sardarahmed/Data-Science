A:

You've probably run make using sudo before (you shouldn't do that), so you'll have to check the permissions on those folders. The easiest way to fix it would be to remove the build folder (using sudo) and try again.
Edit 1: Can you edit your question and paste the output of the following commands there?
roscd sick_tim3xx
ls -lah cfg
git status
whoami

Edit 2: Thanks for adding that info. Something weird is going on: you seem to have deleted the sick_tim3xx/.git directory, for example. Please delete the whole sick_tim3xx directory and run:
git clone -b groovy https://github.com/uos/sick_tim3xx.git

Then start over.

I tried it but i am getting the same error. I know for sure that rosmake is working fine as I have built other packages. Permissions attached with cfg folder are drwxrwxr-x(same for all folders in that directory). And with SickTim3xx.cfg -rw-rw-r-- do i need to change something in these. Thanks alot
Comment by Martin Günther on 2014-05-05:
It's not just the permissions, but also which user the files belong to. I've edited my answer.
Comment by Martin Günther on 2014-05-05:
Also, maybe the file isn't there at all. Try a git reset --hard.
Comment by hgtc-dp on 2014-05-06:
Thanks a lot it worked. Earlier I was downloading the .zip file and then extracting the package. Could you tell me why it could have been failing
Comment by Martin Günther on 2014-05-06:
No idea. Somehow you didn't get all necessary files in the right places. Glad it works now for you. :-)
