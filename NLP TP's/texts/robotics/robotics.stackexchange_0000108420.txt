Q:

rclpy set parameters in global namespace?

As far as I know, it is not possible to set parameters in the '/' namespace from a ROS 2 node, unlike ROS 1. All the parameter set from the ROS 2 node falls in the /node_name. I just wanted to confirm whether that is correct or not.
I have some parameters that I want to set as global parameters that can be accessible by all the other nodes, even if the name of the node declaring those parameters changes. Is it possible with ROS 2?

A:

ROS 2 doesn't have a global parameter server included, each node has their own parameter contexts. So no, by default, you can't set global parameters via the ROS 1 parameter server. With that said:

There's Parameter Client objects you can use to get parameters from other nodes easily as a service call, so that's an option
There are community tools for global parameter servers in ROS 2. But, they're basically just using the tool from bullet 1 above to get them, so semantically not all that different
Something we do in Nav2 is to add parameters to each node's namespace in our launch system. For example, we set the global use_sim_time for all nodes without that field in our param files by injecting it into each namespace when we launch the nodes. So, if you globally want something set, that's an option from within your launch system orchestrating the launch of each of the nodes.
