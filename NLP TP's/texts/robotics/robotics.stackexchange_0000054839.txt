Q:

Moving a robot in rviz

Hi.
I would like to move the robot in rviz, from left to right, from front to back, etc. I understand that rviz is linked to a reference frame, so this does not look easy.
Is there a way to do this in a clean way?
I can still create 2 orthogonal and planar prismatics joints, but the robot model needs to be modify.

A:

You just need to write a node that publishes a transform from some virtual link (e.g. "world") to your robot (e.g. "base_link"), and set the fixed frame in RViz to "world". If you need interaction, take a look at Interactive Markers.

Thx for your answer. Could you tell me a little bit more about this transform publisher? Is it related to TF? TF seems to be designed to convert coordinates between frames, not to move them. I may be wrong since a huge piece of software.

I'm talking about tf, which is designed to handle moving coordinate frames. See the tutorials for further explanation: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials
