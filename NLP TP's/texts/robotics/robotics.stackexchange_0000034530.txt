Q:

ROS Installation for NXT

Hi all,
Here is my question. If I have already installed ros-electric-desktop-full in my desktop, and if I want to work on NXT with ROS, how should I configure it? Can the steps mentioned in "http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/NXT/electric" be executed even if I have already installed ros-electric-desktop-full?
Thanks in advance
CS
