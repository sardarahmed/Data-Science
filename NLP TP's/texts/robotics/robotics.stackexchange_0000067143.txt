Q:

Calculating Odometry Data for the Navigation Stack

Hi Everyone,
I hope someone can help me answer a simple question. My custom robot delivers data. The data are velocity (m / s) and rotation velocity (deg / s or rad / s). I also recieve the distance the robot has traveled (mm). My problem is, I need to publish the odometry-data for the navigation-stack. I followed this tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom). The tutorial calls for the vx and vy and vth coordinates. I have the vth coordinates but I need vx and vy and donÂ´t know how to calculate them having only the velocity and the rotation velocity.
Thank you in advance for any advice!

A:

Assuming that your robot is non-holonomic (that it can only move forward and not side-to-side), then vy will always be 0 since your robot never moves on its Y axis. As for vx, it will simply be the velocity of your robot in m/s.
