Q:

unable to open file 'config1.cfg' (benchmarks)

Hello,
I have been following the tutorial on benchmarking according to this link.
I was able to make a configuration file (I names it config1.cfg like in the tutorial) after I added some scenes and queries to my database.
[scene]
name=No_obstacles_1
runs=2
timeout = 10
output = mylocation.log

[plugin]
name=ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner
planners=RRTConnectkConfigDefault PRMkConfigDefault
runs = 10

When I try to run the benchmark I use the following command:
roslaunch epson_moveit_generated run_benchmark_ompl.launch cfg:=config1.cfg

But it fails at a certain point:
[ INFO] [1398856673.630905167]: Loading robot model 'epsonURDF_gripper'...

So it's unable to open or even find the config file. Can someone explain me why this error occurs and how I can solve it?

I am running ROS hydro in ubuntu 12.04

A:

When nodes are launched through roslaunch, their current working directory is set to ROS_HOME ( usually ~/.ros ).
This means that any file names you provide should use the full path to the file instead of a relative path. I would retry your launch with the full path to your config file.
