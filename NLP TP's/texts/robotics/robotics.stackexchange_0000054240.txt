Q:

How to setup Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01in tutorial MappingFromLoggedData

Hello I am new to ros
I am running the tutorial MappingFromLoggedData and using the existing bag recommended in the tutorial. However, when I run rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan, the map in rviz is some preset map. If i try to create my own bag, it will show "/use_sim_time set to true and no clock published. still waiting for valid time." Is there anything that I do it wrongly? Or is the topic i subscribed to during the rosrun gmapping is wrong?
Thank you.

A:

Hi there,
before recroding your bag run $rosparam set use_sim_time false
let me know if it works.
@lili Meng. if you get same problem, then add a comment instead of your answer to keep the thread organized.
