Q:

Creating stl mesh file with textures

Hello,
I'm trying to make a simple cube to set over a pioneer. The cube has some Aruco Tags (textures). I did the cube in sketchup and them exported it to stl. Then I saved it with meshlab and put it in my robot.
Problem--> the cube doesn't have the textures (Arucos tags) I put in sketchup. How do you export the file with the textures included anyone knows?

update- tried making a .dae with sketchup. Fails to load in meshlab, says it doesn't have the textures. Collada files are really complicated. Putting a texture on a robot is really hard...

A:

"STL files describe only the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object without any representation of color, texture or other common CAD model attributes" (source). If you'd like to represent textures, you'll need to use a different file format, like Collada, which is well supported by the ROS tools.

So I used the wrong program. Maybe I can add up the texture with Meshlab. What program do you recommend to generate the mesh with the textures?

Meshlab has tools for projecting images to geometry (online tutorial, untested by myself), and can export to Collada. There are many other open source (Blender) and proprietary (3DS max, Maya, Rhino, ...) applications that can do the job.

I tried with blender. Blender can't export to .dae. At least I don't see that option.
