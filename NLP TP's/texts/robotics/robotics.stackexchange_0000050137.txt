Q:

Installing pr2_mechanism_msgs: is the hg repository down?

I'm trying to install the pr2simulator stack which requires pr2mechanism, which in turn requires pr2_mechanism_msgs. This is what I tried:
cd ros_ws
rosws set pr2_mechanism_msgs --hg https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/hg
rosws update pr2_mechanism_msgs

This doesn't seem to work. The kforge.ros.org site looks down. I found the pr2simulator stack on github, but pr2_mechanism_msgs isn't hosted there. Can someone please tell me how to get this working? Is there an alternate hosting location?
I tried an hg clone command too and it doesn't work. http://isup.me/kforge.ros.org says the site is down.
I'm on Fedora 18: I must install these from source.

I found this question which is about the same thing, but the answer was to install the deb file which doesn't apply to me: http://answers.ros.org/question/48992/missing-package-pr2_mechanism_msgs-in-pr2_mechanism-stack/

A:

It was down. Also, the hg URL is https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/pr2_mechanism_msgs, not just https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/hg as listed on the wiki page.
$ rosws set pr2_mechanism_msgs --hg https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/pr2_mechanism_msgs
