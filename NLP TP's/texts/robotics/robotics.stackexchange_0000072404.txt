Q:

How to correctly use ROS and Eclipse

Hello all,
I am starting to use ROS with Eclipse and I with doubts about on how to build the source files. Should I do it from inside ** Eclipse**, should I do it with catkin_make or should I do it in other way. I am also starting with c++ and way kind of additional clarification is welcome.
Thanks!!!

A:

Complete instructions for using Eclipse with ROS can be found at the ROS IDEs Wiki page. For what it's worth, I've used both Eclipse and QtCreator with ROS and found QtCreator to be much easier to setup and use since it supports CMake projects by default. Instructions for using QtCreator can be found on that same page.
