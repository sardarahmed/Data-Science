Q:

openni_tracker moving kinect loses user

I am using a kinect on the head of our PR2 robot, and I've noticed that anytime the head moves the openni_tracker loses track of the user/skeleton and thinks it has spotted a new user. I realize that the openni_tracker package is just calling the openni library functions so there is not a whole lot that can probably be done about it, but has anyone else experienced similar results? I tried some simple things like setting the head motion to very slow velocities, but it still seems to lose tracking.
Too bad.

Hi, any alternative solution?

A:

Hi Joe,
From a general point of view the openni skeleton tracker is not meant to work when both human and kinect are moving. Movement, especially rotations, can cause the tracker to fail and loose tracking. However, some people managed to keep tracking will doing slow translations.
You can try retrieving the raw rgb and depth images and look if your motion introduces much noise.
Hope this helps,
Guido
