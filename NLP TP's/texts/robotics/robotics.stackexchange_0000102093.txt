Q:

What does tilde(~) mean in ROS?

I have this sample of code:
def ranger(channel, frame_id):
range_pub = rospy.Publisher('~', Range, queue_size=10)
rate = rospy.Rate(15)

and this sample
if __name__ == '__main__':
    rospy.init_node('obstacle_sensor', anonymous=True)
    c = rospy.get_param('~channel')
    f = rospy.get_param('~frame_id')
    try:
        ranger(channel=c, frame_id=f)
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass

Any help?

As it's already been answered we'll leave this open, but it's a duplicate of #q250092 (which has a very similar title: "Ask about the usage of the tilde '~'sign").

A:

The tilde means "local namespace" and will prefix your node name to the value after the tilde. So if your node was named "my_node" and you publish to "~topic" the actual topic name published will be "my_node/topic".
