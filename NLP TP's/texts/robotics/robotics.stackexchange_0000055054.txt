Q:

Ros Groovy Installation: Can't find vtk-file

I'm trying to install Ros Groovy on Fedora 19, following http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Fedora. I already had a couple of problems that I have been able to solve myself. However, I don't know how to fix the following problem.
When running
sudo ./src_wet/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF --source-space src_wet/ -j1

this error
pcl/io/include/pcl/io/vtk_lib_io.h:57:29: fatal error: vtkSmartPointer.h: No such file or directory

appears. However, the find command gives the location of that file as /usr/include/vtk/vtkSmartPointer.h. So, why is this error happening?

A:

This is a pretty old question, but I thought I'd post an answer. The RIGHT solution is to upgrade to a newer ROS distro, but in the end, it looks like this may simply be an issue of dependencies. I believe that either:

you need to run rosdep to install dependencies for PCL [1]
you encountered a dependency issue in VTK that has been fixed upstream [2] [3]
