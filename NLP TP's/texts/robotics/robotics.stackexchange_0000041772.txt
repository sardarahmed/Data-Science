Q:

nxt_lejos Tutorial vs. rosjava

Hi,
I'm unable to reconstruct the nxt_lejos Getting Started Tutorial as "roslaunch proxy.launch" yields an error about missing rosjava_bootstrap run.py:
user@ubuntu:~/ros_workspace/lejos/learning_nxt_lejos$ roslaunch proxy.launch
... logging to /home/user/.ros/log/e479cc26-c074-11e1-8379-000c29dc495d/roslaunch-ubuntu-3394.log

PARAMETERS
 * /rosversion
 * /connection
 * /rosdistro
 * /nxt_robot
 * /brick_name

NODES

    nxt_lejos_proxy (rosjava_bootstrap/run.py)

process[rosout-1]: started with pid [3421]
started core service [/rosout]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [rosjava_bootstrap/run.py]: Cannot locate node of type [run.py] in package [rosjava_bootstrap]

The file run.py is missing 
which results from trying to perform run.py from rosjava_bootstrap as defined in proxy.launch:
<node pkg="rosjava_bootstrap" 
    type="run.py" 
    args="nxt_lejos_proxy org.lejos.ros.nodes.ROSProxy" 
    name="nxt_lejos_proxy" 
    output="screen">     

As current rosjava_bootstrap lacks such a file, this obviously fails.
How is one supposed to reconstruct the Getting Started Tutorial with current rosjava_core?
Best regards,
Andreas
