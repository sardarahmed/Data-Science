You mean the correct package parameters or?And remappings of what?

The node's parameters and topic remappings. I'd advise to read some basic tutorials that explain this better.

So better to run a launch file for very node yes?
Comment by dornhege on 2012-07-16:
It depends. If you just want to run a node and you don't need to change much, rosrun is absolutely fine. roslaunch is needed for a single node if there are parameters to change or topic remappings to make that you don't want to give manually all the time.

If you want to run something singly that warrants a launch file you can also make single launch files out of the one you use.

ok. So if I want run a luanch file than have to create the package and everything , yes? I mean I have installed and comiled the packages but have only one lanch file for all.

You can make a launch file for a single node or just use rosrun if you don't need to set parameters or remap topics. If you do, the advantage of the launch file is that you don't have to give all those settings on the cmd line.

Ok. So the basic tutorials explain hot to make tne lauch file yes? The coomand for making a lauch file also can be find there?
Comment by dornhege on 2012-07-16:
The basic tutorials describe parameters and topics, so you actually know what you want to do. Documentation for roslaunch can be found on it's wiki site: http://ros.org/wiki/roslaunch

A:

It is possible to run individual node from command line using following command:
rosrun <package-name> <binary-name-in-package-bin>

http://ros.org/wiki/rosrun
It is advisable to use launch file as it is easier to setup various parameters. Launch files avoids a lot of overhead of typing same commands on command line.
