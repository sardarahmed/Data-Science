Q:

rviz_imu_plugin/imu failed to load

I am trying to make the husky robot automatically explore a map with the explore_lite package.  I use melodic on 18.04 and the melodic-devel branches of each package.  In new terminals, running source ~/husky_ws/devel/setup.bash in each, I command:
roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch

and encounter the following error:
[ERROR] [1593994893.360426019, 1308.840000000]: PluginlibFactory: The plugin for class 'rviz_imu_plugin/Imu' failed to load.  Error: Could not find library corresponding to plugin rviz_imu_plugin/Imu. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.

I did also clone the package https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/imu_tools in my /src. I didn't change the contents of the package_description.xml, which reads:
<library path="lib/librviz_imu_plugin">

  <class name="rviz_imu_plugin/Imu"
         type="rviz::ImuDisplay"
         base_class_type="rviz::Display">

    <description>
      Displays the orientation and acceleration components of sensor_msgs/Imu messages.
    </description>

  </class>

</library>

Any advice about changing the xml of file layout is appreciated!!

Hi ildaniel,
You are missing a plugin. Just execute the following:
-

sudo apt-get install ros-$(rosversion
-d)-rviz-imu-plugin

Hope it works.

With lack of response from the original poster, I marked this as an answer, not because this seems a solution but because this might likely resolve the issue. From the OP's description, we can only tell that pluginlib was told to find rviz_imu_plugin/IMU plugin but couldn't find, which doesn't directly mean .deb package was not installed. But it's likely.
