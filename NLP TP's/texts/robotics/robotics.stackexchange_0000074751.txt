Q:

velocity smoother

Hello,
I am working on my navigation project, where i am using turtlebot, Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo. Everything is working fine, but sometimes my robot does some jerky movements which i want to avoid. I came across velocity_smoother in ROS but i am not sure how i can use to make my robots' velocity smooth. How can i integrate it in my launch file or should i remap my velocity topics?
Can anyone help me with this?
Thanks,
Sai Krishna Allani

I don't think you should be thinking about smoothing the velocity. The local planners already available provide acceleration control parameters that you can use in order to limit changes in the output velocity.

A:

It will not generate a very good result. But if you only want to implement, seems the velocity smoother wiki is quite clear... Try read through the page more carefully. If still no progress I can post my config file. http://wiki.ros.org/yocs_velocity_smoother
