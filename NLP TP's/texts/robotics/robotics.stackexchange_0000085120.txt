Q:

Where can I get the amcl.patch and stage.patch

I am trying to make multi_robot_collision_avoidance work, but I cannot get the amcl.patch mentioned in the installation document. Without those I have got some error, like missing stage_ros.msg. I am running on indigo, how can I fix this?

What patch and documentation are you referring to?

this is the document I am referring to. @jayess

A:

The instructions for applying the patch from the wiki page that you refer to say

patch AMCL:
roscd collvoid/..
mv amcl.patch ../navigation
roscd navigation/..
patch -p1 < amcl.patch

If you look at the above commands, you'll see that the file amcl.patch is should be in the root of the repo (one directory above collvoid/). I looked at the GitHub repo and found the file by switching to the "forward-predict" branch. So, if you need to apply that patch, switch to the "forward-predict" repo and you'll have the patch.
