Q:

roboearth installation sucessful but cant run re_comm

Hi
I was able to install/make it successful and run all its nodes except re_comm
i get the following error
usr1@CrevaviWS2:~$ rosrun re_comm run
find: `/jre/lib/': No such file or directory
Cannot find libjsig ... maybe you need to set JAVA_HOME?
Plz help

A:

I had the exact same issue. I did the following to get it to work.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts
Hit TAB to get to Ok prompt. Ok to next screen as well.
When done, type java -version to see that it is installed
You should be able to cd to the following path
/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib
If that path exists then do the following.
cd to /etc
sudo vi bash.bashrc
go to the end of the follow, add the following, save and exit
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
export JAVA_HOME
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
export PATH
once you exit, confirm new JAVA_HOME is set by typing
echo $JAVA_HOME
If the path shows up, you are done.
In a new terminal run
rosrun re_comm run

@Scott
the first command
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java
Traceback (most recent call last):
