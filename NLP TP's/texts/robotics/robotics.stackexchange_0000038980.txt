Q:

Position and Velocity

Is there a standard-ish message that represents an object's 3d position and 3d velocity?
[insert Heisenberg joke here]

A:

geometry_msgs/Twist is for velocities, geometry_msgs/Pose is for position and orientation.
nav_msgs/Odometry contains both together with covariances (whereas designed for other purpose).
If you just need Twist and Pose together, you can easily design your own message.
