Q:

[Theorical] Qt-ros package for ROS Melodic

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to  migrate a project from ROS Kinetic to ROS Melodic. I've developed an application GUI to control a robot, but when I try to install the dependencies for this project in ROS Melodic, the console output tells me that qt-build package is still not developed for this ROS distro. 1) Does anyone know if there's a way to install this packages in ROS Melodic?
In case this option is not allowed, 2) how can I migrate qt user interface into ROS Melodic using qt ros pluggin?
Thanks in advance for your help.
