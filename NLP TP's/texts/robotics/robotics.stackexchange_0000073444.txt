Q:

How to assign a color to each pcd file when viewing multiple files with pcl_viewer from the terminal

To visualize multiple point clouds concurrently I use

pcl_viewer file1.pcd file2.pcd

pcl_viewer then assigns random colors to each file but I can not relate which color represents which file. Is it possible to manually assign a color to each pcd file ?

A:

With many trials I noticed that the options specified when using the pcl_viewer command only affects the very next file after it. So, to give different colors for each file simply add the color option with the wanted rgb values before each file as follows:

pcl_viewer -fc 0,0,255 file1.pcd -fc 0,255,0 file2.pcd
