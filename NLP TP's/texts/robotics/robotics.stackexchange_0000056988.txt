Q:

create my_robot.urdf file?

In the tutorial:
wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Create your own urdf file
In which directory do I have to create my_robot.urdf file?
I created in my home directory (mudassar) and it did not successfully execute following commands:
rosmake urdfdom_model
check_urdf my_robot.urdf # hydro
Could you please guide the possible reason?
MY ros is hydro and I am using ubuntu 12.04LTS.
