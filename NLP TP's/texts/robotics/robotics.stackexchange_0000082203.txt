Q:

Debian 8 Kinetic no packages can be located

Hi, I am following Kinetic install on Debian guide (http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Debian) but no packages can be found. The Step 1.4 in the guide returns the same message for all different packages. I am running this on Beagle bone Black.
The http://packages.ros.org is getting hit.
Please see image below with the command-line I am seeing.

Any advice would be much appreciated.
Thanks

A:

You look to be running on armhf. Kinetic only targets Debian Jessie arm64 for binary builds.
At the top of the installation page it calls out supported architectures: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Debian
We build armhf for Kinetic on Ubuntu Xenial.
