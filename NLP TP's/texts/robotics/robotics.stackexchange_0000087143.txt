Q:

Question about tutorial "Publishing Odometry Information over ROS"

http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom

Add the dependancy to your package's manifest.xml
<depend package="tf"/>
<depend package="nav_msgs"/>

A:

manifest.xml is used in the legacy rosbuild build system while package.xml is used in the catkin build system
In package.xml, you need to add the following lines:
<build_depend>nav_msgs</build_depend>
<build_depend>tf</build_depend>

<run_depend>nav_msgs</run_depend>
<run_depend>tf</run_depend>

In addition, you can find the complete code for this tutorial at this link:
