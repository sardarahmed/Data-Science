Q:

Carrot_planner what algorithm it use

At first i've tried global planner for my project, just because i can use different algorithms for path planning. But then i found out that carrotPlanner is more suitable for my project although i cant find any documentation about which algorithm carrot planner use. I have to know cause i must mention it in my thesis.

A:

The carrot planner is barely an "algorithm" - and so you won't find any references to an academic paper about it. The approach is described in detail on the ROS wiki (http://wiki.ros.org/carrot_planner):

The planner takes a goal point from an external user, checks if the
user-specified goal is in an obstacle, and if it is, it walks back
along the vector between the user-specified goal and the robot until a
goal point that is not in an obstacle is found"
