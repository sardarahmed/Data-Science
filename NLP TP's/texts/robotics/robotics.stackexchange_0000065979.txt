Q:

Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_create.so

I am following the Explore the Gazebo world tutorial of turtlebot_simulator in ROS Indigo. Whenever I try to launch roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch I get the following error
Error [Plugin.hh:156] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_create.so: libgazebo_ros_create.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I have ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-control installed. What do I do to fix this?
Edit:
I have also tried compiling from source.

Installing turtlebot_create_desktop from source solved the problem.

@isankad1990 if this didn't solve your issue you should ask a new question. The answerer (who also asked the question) clearly marked this answer as correct for them.
