Q:

slam gmapping real time on rviz

Hi all,
I am doing slam gmapping on my robot. i run rviz so that I can visualise the map real time. However, the map seems to take a long time before appearing.
rostopic echo /scan provides data quickly.
rostopic echo /map_metadata about 40seconds before data is being churned.
rostopic echo /map  gives a huge array of -1
since map_metadata has a delay 40 seconds, i am guessing this is the cause for the delay in the visualisation of map in rviz. Is there a parameter where i can tune to fasten map output?
Thank you.

A:

Check out the wiki page (maybe you want to have a look at wiki pages before asking questions about parameters) and the parameter map_update_interval which is by default set to 5.0.
Note that the visualization(!) of the map is actually not when scans are integrated, but only when a new gridmap is assembled and sent out over the topic. Also note, that the robot needs to move for scans to be integrated.

EDIT
Well, if the maps are distorted and it still takes a long time, you probably have some problem with the mapping process itself. Maybe also not enough processing power?
Parameters that might lower computational requirements: throttle_scans, maxUrange, linear/angularUpdate, temporalUpdate, particles.
However, note that some of those parameters might result in even worse maps.

Hi mig, thank you for your answers. I know of the parameter map_update_interval and have already lowered it to 1.0. But the processing still takes a long time and the subsequent maps produced are always distorted. Hence i thought that there may be some other parameters that I can tweak.
