Q:

How can I add a dependency after I have created a package?

Hi all,
I created a package called demo. It has two dependencies

roscpp

robot_comm

Now I want to interface it with a sensor, so I created a node called 'cell_node' for the sensor. I plan to use information from a topic in 'cell_node' which publishes the message 'loadMsg' at 50Hz.
But then, I am getting an error
cell_node/loadMsg.h : No such file or directory.
I kind of know why this is happening. It is because I never added cell_node to the list of dependencies when I first created my package demo.
My question is, how can I add a new dependency to an already existing package, so that it compiles code in that dependency too?
Thanks! All help is appreciated :)

A:

in the manifest.xml file of your package add a dependency near the others
<depend package="cell_node"/>
