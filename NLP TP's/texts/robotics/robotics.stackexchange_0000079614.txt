Q:

When launching node on remote machine, is the local or remote version of the package used?

If PC 1 runs Node A on PC 2, does PC 2 use the code from PC 1 or PC2?

A:

What roslaunch really does is start a client roslaunch on PC 2 (using SSH), which is then used by the master roslaunch server on PC 1 to start nodes on PC 2, but those binaries will need to be present on PC 2 (they don't get up or downloaded by anyone in this setup).
So in your words: PC 2 will "use the code from PC 2".
See also wiki/roslaunch/Architecture - Remote Processes for some details about how this works.

Edit: I've seen setups which worked around this limitation by using NFS (or a similar remote FS) to export a workspace that was then shared by all hosts. In this way all hosts would start the exact same nodes, but of course this comes with its own difficulties.

I thought that was case, but always good to check. Thank you!
