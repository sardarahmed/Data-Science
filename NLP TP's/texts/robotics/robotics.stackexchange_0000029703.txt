Can you include the output of 'rosmake --rosdep-install roscpp'?

"rosmake veltrobot_teleop veltrobot_movement robot_state_publisher rviz"
http://www.ros.org/wiki/cturtle/Installation/Ubuntu I used that tutorial to install.

Can you list the exact command you are trying to use to build veltrobot_movement?
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-02-20:
How did you install ROS? Debs? Did you setup your .bashrc properly?

A:

Conflicting packages... the problem was that when the terminal started it would cturtle/setup.bash then ~/ni/setup.sh the setup.sh would set the ROSROOT to the unstable and get rid of the veltrop packet list from the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. When adding the veltrop package to the PATH it would rid of the OPENNI package path. When running the ~/ni/setup.sh it would bring me to the unstable which would render to a roscpp due to conflicting paths. Thanks for the help.
