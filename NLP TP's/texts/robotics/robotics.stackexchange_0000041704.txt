Q:

hector_gazebo stack error when rosmake

Hi, I'm trying to build hector_quadrotor stack, but it need hector_gazebo first. When I try to build hector_gazebo i get:
/home/franco/ros_workspace/hector_gazebo/hector_gazebo_thermal_camera/include/hector_gazebo_thermal_camera/gazebo_ros_thermal_camera.h:63:27: error fatal: gazebo/Param.hh: No such file or directory
I think it's a API problem with the new gazebo. Am I in correct?
I am usin Ubuntu 12.04, ROS fuerte, and I have installed (before ROS) Gazebo 1.0.1.
Can help me?
Thanks.
Franco

Looks like it is an API issue.  In the hector quadroto announcement they did say that they would be updating for Gazebo 1.0 after Fuerte was released: http://www.ros.org/news/2012/03/announcement-of-hector-quadrotor-stack.html.  There is also a Fuerte branch in their svn repo.

Hi,
I had the same error, but by browsing in the tu-darmstadt repository i found the branch for fuerte, as JonW said. It compiles without problem.
the source is
http://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/fuerte/hector_gazebo/
they also have all the other packages there.
regards.
Mario
