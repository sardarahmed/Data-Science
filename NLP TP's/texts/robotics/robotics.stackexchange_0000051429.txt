Q:

Pr2_controller for wheels robot

Just wondering, I am looking to move the base of my wheels robot by using the pr2_controller. (in Gazebo)
But I already looked onto the tutorial a little. I am still a bit confused. How do I incorporate the controller onto my  robot (segway RMP), do I consider it as a plugin or what? Or do I have to write controller of my own?
Some guidance will be extremely helpful for me to head into the correct direction.
Thank you all!

A:

You should place a transmission element in your model. You can then load a PR2 controller to control the joint. I am not sure if this works in sdf. In urdf you should incorporate such an element:
<transmission type="SimpleTransmission" name="caster_front_left_trans">
  <actuator name="caster_front_left_motor" />
  <joint name="caster_front_left_joint" />
  <mechanicalReduction>1</mechanicalReduction>
</transmission>

See the links this thread for more info.

thank you. I am following the tutorial here:http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_controllers/Tutorials/Using%20the%20robot%20base%20controllers%20to%20drive%20the%20robot   .............
so to use it, do I have to attach the controller to my sdf robot first?

For you own robot yes. Try to find the corresponding part in the urdf (or sdf) of the PR2 and copy that to your own robot.

sorry, I am still confused. Would you mind to explain a little about the purpose of controller? I use the Diff-drive plugin got it moving in gazebo. I have been following the tutorials and everything is working in sdf, and the website rarely mention about PR2 controller.
