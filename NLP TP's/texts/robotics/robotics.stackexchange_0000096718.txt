Q:

How to solve MD5sum version error?

I'm using
Windows7: MATLAB R2020a
Ubuntu 18.04: ROS melodic, UR3 in Gazebo
My code is
[urArm, urGoalMsg] = rosactionclient('arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory');
Error message of ROS is
[ERROR] [1523601174.867179119, 8.956000000]: Client [/matlab_global_node_65047] wants topic /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/result to have datatype/md5sum [control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionResult/bce83d50f7bb28226801436caf0e2043], but our version has [control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionResult/c4fb3b000dc9da4fd99699380efcc5d9]. Dropping connection.
how can I solve this. I tried deleting devel and build files and catkin_make again. It didn't work. Please help

Can you please post more information about your issue. I don't see a proper error message in there.

The msg definitions might be different. Easiest way to check if what you get is what you expected is to do a rosmsg info

A:

The problem here appears to be that your Matlab ROS support uses a different version of the control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionResult message than your ROS Melodic install.
The error message about the MD5 sums no matching is telling you this.
As to why this is the case I wouldn't know. control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryAction hasn't changed in many years, so it's unclear to me how this could happen.
As to how to fix this (or work-around it): I would suggest you ask Mathworks for support. Assuming you haven't made any changes to ros-melodic-control-msgs on your Ubuntu machine, the problem would seem to be on the side of Matlab.

As a guess: perhaps Matlab is using rosjava, in which case this might be caused by rosjava/rosjava_bootstrap#16, but again: just a guess
