Q:

PrimeSense Failed to set USB interface Error

I have an Asus Xtion Camera attached to my computer running ROS Groovy
So far I've installed

Openni_Camera binary ( http://ros.org/wiki/openni_camera )
Openni_launch binary ( http://ros.org/wiki/openni_launch )
Openni SDK  ( http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/ )
PrimeSense Sensor Module for Openni ( https://github.com/PrimeSense/Sensor/tree/unstable )

Everytime I run
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 

i get this error
    process[camera/depth/metric_rect-8]: started with pid [25941]
process[camera/depth/metric-9]: started with pid [25955]
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException'

I can run samples from the openni sdk outside of ros sometimes like "SimpleViewer". Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I just don't get it. It detects the device but can't set the USB interface...what gives?

Did you install /55-primesense-usb.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d? This file may be found here:  https://github.com/PrimeSense/Sensor/blob/unstable/Platform/Linux/Install/55-primesense-usb.rules )

How to i install that file to /etc/udev/rules.d ?
Comment by dPackard on 2013-08-09:
If you installed the package via apt-get, tit is probably installed already (just check if the file exists). Otherwise you can create the file manually using your favorite text editor and sudo. (e.g. sudo gvim /etc/udev/rules.d/55-primesense-usb.rules).

Tried that, no luck. I appreciate your help though.
Comment by dPackard on 2013-08-09:
If that file already exists (or if creating it doesn't help), you might find a solution here: ( http://answers.ros.org/question/55201/using-ros-with-kinect-failed-to-set-usb-interface/ )

I went ahead and got a kinect. Still problems, just much less ;)

Were you able to resolve the issue? I am using a Kinect.

A:

I experienced the same problem with the Xtion. It could be resolved by plugging the device into another, non USB3.0 compatible, USB port.
