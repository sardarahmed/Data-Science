Q:

why the node laser_filters fails after updated

Hi, all. I am using "Hokuyo URG04LX UG01" and trying to test a ros wrapper for people detector by detecting legs.
Naturally, the node "laser_filters" was used for preprocessing the laser data.  In the beginning, some warnings about laser_filters promted me that I should update laser_filters node. And the results of running leg detctor was not good. So I updated the "laser_filters" node by "sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-laser-filters" and run the wrapper for people detector. I got following errors:
process[laser_filter-3]: started with pid [5766]
 /opt/ros/hydro/lib/laser_filters/scan_to_scan_filter_chain: symbol lookup error:/opt/ros/hydro/lib/laser_filters/scan_to_scan_filter_chain: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7package10getPluginsERKSsS2_RSt6vectorISsSaISsEEb

The config yaml file for laser filter is shown here:
scan_filter_chain:
- name: range
  type: LaserScanRangeFilter
  params: 
     lower_threshold: 0.0001
     upper_threshold: .inf
- name: shadows
  type: ScanShadowsFilter
  params:
    min_angle: 10
    max_angle: 172
    neighbors: 1
    window: 1
- name: interpolation
  type: InterpolationFilter

My ros version is hydro.  Looking forward to give my any advices. Thanks!

A:

I found the answer. This is because of the incompatible between roslib and updated laser_filters. After updating roslib, the problem was solved. Thanks!
