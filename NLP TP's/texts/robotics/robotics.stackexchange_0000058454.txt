A:

There is a debug script in the gazebo_ros package which you can use in place of gzserevre to start gazebo with gdb. Now how you use gdb is outside the scope of this forum. I suggest googling. There is a ton of documentation on using gdb out there.

Several of the standard launch files support launching with the argument debug:=true to launch gazebo in gdb.
