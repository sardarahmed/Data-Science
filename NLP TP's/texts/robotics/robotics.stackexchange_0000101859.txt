Q:

move_base goal_tolerance has no effect

I'm trying to set up the navigation stack and was experimenting with the goal_tolerance parameters. I set the following in my launch file:
xy_goal_tolerance: 300.0
yaw_goal_tolerance: 300.0
free_goal_vel: True
When I set a 2D Nav Goal with a couple of meters distance to the current 2D Pose in rviz I get the status: "This goal has been accepted by the simple action server"
Only when I set the goal exactly onto the current 2D Pose I get the result "Goal reached." How come, the tolerance parameters seem to be ignored?
Best regards

A:

The problem was a rather silly one. I did not configure move_base to actually use the local_planner for which I was setting the goal_tolerance parameter. Instead I was using the default local_planner.
