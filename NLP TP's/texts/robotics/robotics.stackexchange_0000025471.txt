Q:

libgazebo_player not working

Hi All,
I am trying to make Gazebo work with player and was going trying to go through the examples but every time I try open player I get the following error. Player has been working fine for me with stage so far. I am only having problems with Gazebo.
error   : Failed to load plugin libgazebo_player.
error   : libtool reports error: file not found
error   : plugin search path: /home/fahad/Spider:.:/usr/local/lib64/
error   : failed to load plugin: libgazebo_player
error   : failed to parse config file camera.cfg driver blocks
Gazebo does detect that player is installed.
Any one else has encountered the same problem?

A:

The binary gazebo .deb was built without Player support, so it doesn't have the player plugin library.  It seems like a good idea to start building Player support into the .deb.  I created a ticket for that.
