Q:

Convert point cloud video to .las format

I have point cloud video and I want to convert it to .las format. Maybe there is tool for point cloud video conversion to .las 3D format? Or maybe you can give an approach for achieving that?

Sorry, I just have a point cloud in RVIZ. I want to export it to LAS. Is it possible?

A:

I'm not aware of any converts ROS point clouds to the las format. Assuming you're talking about the ASPRS LAS format? https://www.asprs.org/committee-general/laser-las-file-format-exchange-activities.html
You probably want to look into PCL methods or integrations with LAS.
