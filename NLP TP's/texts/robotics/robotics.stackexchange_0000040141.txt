Q:

Looking for a USB Mixer ROS interface

I'm interested in using a Motorized USB Audio Mixer to control my ROS based system.  One example mixer would be the Behringer BCF2000.  Has anyone built a ROS driver for this device or similar USB Mixer/MIDI hardware?
Thanks!

A:

To actuate the Behringer BCF2000, have a look here:
https://kforge.ros.org/sandbox/bcf2000_driver
It's pretty similar to what was posted above. It uses pygame.midi and exposes the device with a standard Joy message. Pretty straightforward. You can listen to messages on /bcf2000/joy and write to /bcf2000/joy/input to actuate the sliders (axes) or light up the LEDs (buttons).
