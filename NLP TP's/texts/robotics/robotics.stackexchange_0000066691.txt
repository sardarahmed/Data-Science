Q:

Introduction to tf installation error

Hello,
I found that when following the command "sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-tutorials ros-hydro-geometry-tutorials rviz", I got an error. I resolved this by changing "rviz" to "ros-hydro-rviz". Is this the correct way to do this or should it be working with just "rviz"?
