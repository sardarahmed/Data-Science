Q:

How to use ros on arm?

I reference the Documentation and follow the instructions of GumROS , try to cross compile ROS for my board.But,when I move it to my board ,then set environment variables,and then type "roscore" , I got an error " ERROR: rosout is not built. Please run 'rosmake rosout' ".I'm sure that rosout is in the bin dir.How can I solve it? THX~

A:

The GumROS instructions are a little out of date. There are several sets of instructions you may want to try on the  Installation page. http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
The most recently updated one appears to be the OpenEmbedded instructions. I suggest you try that out: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/OpenEmbedded
