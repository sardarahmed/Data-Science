Q:

roslaunch terminal split screen

Hello,
i am launching over a launch file several nodes in new shells as shown here:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
  <node pkg="coral_frontend" type="CORAL_display" name="CORAL_display" output="screen" launch-prefix="gnome-terminal --geometry 80x43+55+14 -e"/>
  <node pkg="coral_frontend" type="CORAL_interface" name="CORAL_interface" output="screen" launch-prefix="gnome-terminal --geometry 56x44+788+-10 -e"/>
  <node pkg="socketcan_bridge" type="socketcan_bridge_node" name="socketcan_bridge_node" output="log"/>
  <node pkg="ipos" type="IPOS_node" name="IPOS_node" output="log"/>
</launch>

I wanna start the first two nodes in a terminal with splitted view, but was not able to do so with guake, byobu, yakuake or screen, since they do have just shortcuts to split the screens. Does somebody have suggestion or encountered a similar challenge?
Thank you very much!
Michael

A:

I don't know for sure, but perhaps fmauch/catmux can do this.
If it can't yet, it would be a good enhancement PR (tmuxinator appears to be able to do it).

There is an answer on askubuntu where someone allegedly used tmux for this purpose. Link

I believe that is basically what catmux does, but then with a bit more domain knowledge of ROS and how launchfiles work.
