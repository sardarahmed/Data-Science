Q:

'serializationLength' but non-virtual destructor with custom message

I have created a ros node that is a subscriber and publisher. I have also created a message type called "patd" which has the following types:
int32 distance
String Pattern_no
after doing rosmake the custom message class is created and I have done the include accordingly, "depth_viewer/patd.h".
my problem is that when ever I try to use the custom message I get an error when running the node, "segmentation fault" as i'm working with the kinect.
this is the error I get regarding my custom message:
Class '[C@254fb0' has virtual method 'serializationLength' but non-virtual destructor
please have a look at this screenshot http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v67/maltenrazer/roserror.jpg
