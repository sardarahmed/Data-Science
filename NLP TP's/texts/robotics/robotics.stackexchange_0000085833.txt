Q:

Astra Pro RGB & Depth publishing rate not quite same. [Closed]

Hello all,
I want to use Orbbec Astra Pro in ROS Indigo inside Ubuntu 14.04. I have installed the ROS compatible OPenNI2 and now able to run the launch code. The Astra Pro Camera starts perfectly without any issue.
Now the problem is when i check the publishing rate of RGB and Depth stream I see that they are not quite same.
Here are the outputs..

What can I do to get 30hz publish rate for both RGB and Depth
Cheers,
Prasanna

Just keep it in mind for your next question.

But I'm closing this issue as I have found the bug.

It would be nice if you could post what you found as an answer and then accept your own answer.

A:

Sorry for the silly question. I solved the issue.
Here is a solution to my problem regarding the publish rate of RGB image.
previously it was . and thats way I was getting 15Hz rate, but now it's 30Hz as I have changed it.
before ---------  param name="frame_rate" value="15"
after ---------  param name="frame_rate" value="30"
This is for the libuvc_ros driver that I'm using for Astra Pro with astra_pro.launch file.
using the following command
$ roslaunch astra_launch astra_pro.launch

<node pkg="libuvc_camera" type="camera_node" name="astra_pro_uvc">
    <!-- Parameters used to find the camera -->
    <param name="vendor" value="0x2bc5"/>
    <param name="product" value="0x0501"/>
    <param name="serial" value=""/>
    <!-- If the above parameters aren't unique, choose the first match: -->
    <param name="index" value="0"/>

    <!-- Image size and type -->
    <param name="width" value="640"/>
    <param name="height" value="480"/>
    <!-- choose whichever uncompressed format the camera supports: -->
    <param name="video_mode" value="uncompressed"/> <!-- or yuyv/nv12/jpeg -->
    <param name="frame_rate" value="30"/>
    <param name="frame_id" value="$(arg camera)_rgb_optical_frame"/>

    <param name="timestamp_method" value="start"/> <!-- start of frame -->
    
    
    <!-- Change has to be done here to add the camera calibration file-->
    
    <!-- <param name="camera_info_url" value="file:///tmp/cam.yaml"/> -->

    <param name="auto_exposure" value="3"/> <!-- use aperture_priority auto exposure -->
    <param name="auto_white_balance" value="false"/>
  </node>

</group> <!-- rgb -->

Thanks,
Prasanna
