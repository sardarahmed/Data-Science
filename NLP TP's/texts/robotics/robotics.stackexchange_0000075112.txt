Q:

Setting PointGrey camera parameters?

Am bit confuse on where and how to modify Cameleon 3 camera parameters. For example, in PointGrey,cfg, there seems to be three different values... Why not only one
gen.add("frame_rate",         double_t, SensorLevels.RECONFIGURE_RUNNING,    "Camera speed (frames per second).",                                            100, 0, 100)

Also please, how to set the values in  camera.launch instead of  PointGrey,cfg, so as to avoid the need of compiling after each modification?
Am particularly interested in frame_rate, exposure, shutter speed, and image size...

A:

Probably the easiest way to do this will be to use rqt_reconfigure, where you should be able to access and change your camera's parameters. I used it for the Chameleon 3 camera, and it worked pretty much out of the box.

It works but you have to launch that everytime.. Do you know how to set the desire frame rate to be launched by default?
