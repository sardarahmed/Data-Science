Q:

Setup.bash and Arch Linux

Hello, I'm a new Ros-user. I installed it with success, but I have a problem. When I give in input in my shell source ~/ros/setup.bash I obtain as answer this:
Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 17, in    File "", line 17, in  TypeError: 'dict_keys' object does not support indexing rospack could not be found, you cannot have rosbash features until you bootstrap ros
And nothing works. If I type the command again all works and I don't receive any error messages.

A:

IIRC, Arch Linux has Python 3 by default, which creates compatibility issues with ROS.  I am not an Arch user, but I imagine some bug tickets (and patches) are necessary to be compatible with Arch in this case.
