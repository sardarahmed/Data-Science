Q:

How to extract information from hector slam for autonomous navigation

Hello,
I've got hector slam working with my hokuyo laser range finder. Now, I'm trying to use the information it uses to generate a map so that I can use it for navigating an aerial robot. Can someone please help me or direct me somewhere that will help me use hector slam for autonomous navigation?
Thanks!

A:

hector_slam outputs a standard nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid message. Being "the" standard for 2D map representation, this message type is used by a lot of packages providing different functionality:

SLAM, generating map, simutaneously
localizing within them (gmapping,
hector_mapping)
self-localization in provided
map (AMCL)
navigation based upon map (move_base)
exploring environments (explore,
hector_exploration_planner)

Note this list is not exhaustive but just a few examples off the top of my head.

That really helps!

This is helpful however more info on how to integrate hector slam odom info into move base, would be greatly appreciated! What are the launch files that need to be changed when pulling odometry info from hector into move base? in this case we are not using AMCL at all correct?
