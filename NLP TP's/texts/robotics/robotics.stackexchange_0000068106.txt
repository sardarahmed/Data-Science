Q:

How do you use inverseTimes()?

How do you use inverseTimes?
From reading the docs, it looks like it should be a member function of Transform(), and take another Transform() as the argument.
However, the following code:
from geometry_msgs.msg import Transform
my_tf1 = Transform()
my_tf2 = Transform()
my_tf1.translation.x = 2
my_tf2.translation.x = 5
my_tf1.inverseTimes(my_tf2) 

produces the error:

AttributeError: 'Transform' object has no attribute 'inverseTimes'

Is there a different object in tf called Transform that I should be using instead?

I've noticed that some tf functions from c++ are not available in python... I can't think of a workaround that is quicker than implementing this function yourself :-(

A:

inverseTimes is a member of tf::Transform in the C++ API. I don't see any equivalent in Python. I'm sure you can do the same thing with numpy (or possibly PyKDL) though.
