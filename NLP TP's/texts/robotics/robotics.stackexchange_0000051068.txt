Q:

Integrate ROS Groovy and QtCreator

I have successfully integrated the code ROS with QT libraries. To do
this I created the project with catkin_create_pkg and then I added all
the necessary (cpp file, ui, wrappers, etc.) in the file CMakeList.txt.
I am then able to successfully compile my project through catkin.
My question now is this: how do I continue
my work through the environment QtCreator? I know very well that the
QtCreator is capable of interpreted file from CMake, but not
by catkin.
My system is Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Groovy Galapagos.
Thanks to all.

A:

I was able to use QtCreator by running through the catkin
following steps:

Since QtCreator needs its own working directory that I put in
a place where you do not bother.
In the "Build Settings"

2.1. I set the following custom build settings "build steps"
-command: catkin_make
-Working directory: /home/myuser/catkin_ws
-Command arguments: none
2.2. I set the following custom clean settings "clean steps"
-command: catkin_make clean
-Working directory: /home/myuser/catkin_ws
-Command arguments: none

In the "Run Settings" menu I have replaced the "Run" default configuration with my custom:

-Run configuration: MyCustomRunConfiguration
-Executable: my_executable
-Arguments: none
-Working diretcory: /home/myuser/catkin_ws/devel/lib/my_executable
I know that is not a permanent solution but only a trick,
also the folder created by QtCreator is never used. to
now is the best I could do.
