A:

For general robotics Q&A, relatively new site http://robotics.stackexchange.com/ might be the best (that said, if you aksing for broader purpose than just ROS, you should ask there, not here).
Followings are more general forums (i.e. not Q&A per se) but there seem to be very skilled hobbyists and professionals:
HBRobotics (Homebrew Robotics Club) https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hbrobotics
DPRG (Dallas Personal Robotics Group) http://www.dprg.org/
