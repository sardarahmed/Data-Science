Q:

rviz setup error

According   to Tutorial   setup      （Ubuntu10.04   ROS ELECTRIC   version）
first      run   rosdep install rviz       rosmake rviz  rosrun rviz rviz      rviz  not  work  ??
run command output :
rviz revision number 1.6.7
ogre_tools revision number 1.6.3
compiled against OGRE version 1.7.3 (Cthugha)
Loading general config from [/home/robot/.rviz/config]
Loading display config from [/home/robot/.rviz/display_config]
RTT preferred mode is PBbuffer
The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'Baddrawable
(Details: serial 17 error_code 16 request_code 153 minor_code 17)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
glxinfo gives me this：
robot@robot:~$  glxinfo |grep version
server glx version string: 1.2
client glx version string: 1.4
GLX version: 1.2
OpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 7.7.1
OpenGL shading language version string: 1.20
Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? Thanks.( I  can success  rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node   )

A:

Several things:

You're using very old versions of ROS and Ubuntu. These are not supported any more.
The old version of rviz that you're using probably doesn't work well without a dedicated graphics card. Do you have an Nvidia graphics card, and have you tried installing the drivers for it?

no,   which you are using    ros and ubuntu verison
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-08-07:
The old versions of rviz don't work very without a graphics card. I recommend upgrading to one of the newer versions of rviz in ROS Hydro and Ubuntu 12.04, or ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04.

thanks  for  your  help        I SELECT   ROS Hydro and Ubuntu 12.04  ,     but   this  version   not   support
pr2   ?

You made no mention of PR2 before. The most recent version of ROS with full support for the PR2 was ROS Groovy.
