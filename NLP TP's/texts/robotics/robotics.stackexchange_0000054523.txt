Dear Brian, although I am pretty sure what the answer is, can you edit your question and post the error message you receive, to make the question useful for other people too, please?

Hi kr1zz; I have already asked the question giving full error details in the above link

A:

Let me quote your question:

I have USARSim running on windows7 on
a desktop and P3AT is loaded using
Iridium. In my laptop I have ROS
installed and through a LAN wire I try
to connect to both machines. I type
follow commands in my laptop which are
given below:

roscore

roslaunch usarsim_inf usarsim.launch

[ERROR] [1380608092.814131851]: can't
open socket to localhost port 3000

Then you are trying to connect to localhost, whereas you should try to connect to the computer running windows 7 and USARSim.
Solution: replace the string localhost on the second line with the IP address (or the name) of the computer where USARSim is running
