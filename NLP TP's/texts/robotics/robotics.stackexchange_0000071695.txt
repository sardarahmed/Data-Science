Q:

Cannot catkin_make example from Tutorials

I used my fresh knowledge from package form format to extend basics of catkins cmakelist.txt and package.xml
Is there anything principally wrong with it or is all right. It does work with catkin_make
I use this CMakeLits and package.xml.txt. I would be glad if someone could have a look at it and tell if any mistakes in it

Edit: So i got the general order, but where to place this, it feels like deadlock: How to add when it needs to be exported?
add_library(my_test_lib ${MY_TEST_LIB_SRC})

catkin_package(
    CATKIN_DEPENDS #catkin packages
        roscpp 
        std_msgs 
        #message_generation
    #DEPENDS Boost  #other libs
    #INCLUDE_DIRS include   #my headers
    LIBRARIES my_test_lib #my exported libs from the project
    #CFG_EXTRAS - Additional configuration options 
)

re: deadlock: there is no deadlock. As the documentation states, just add all your add_library(..) and add_executable(..) statements after the catkin_package(..) statement.

A:

The only obvious thing that I would warn you about is the ordering; see my answer to: http://answers.ros.org/question/225447/how-to-move-packages-from-build-to-devel-folder/
The ordering requirement is the last item on this page: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/catkin_overview.html and is also documented on the wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt
