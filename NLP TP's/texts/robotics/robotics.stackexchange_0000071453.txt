Q:

3D SLAM without IMU possible?

hi, I'm very new to ros and working on the same problem of building 3d map using lidar but i don't have imu. can you please tell me is it possible to build 3d map without imu? and for that what is the procedure.
I have pioneer 3at robot with ros jade version.

A:

This depends on your sensor setup. If it can provide 3D-pointclouds at a high enough rate, you can do 3D-SLAM by aligning the pointclouds with an ICP-Algorithm. You can also use the pioneer's wheel odometry to replace the IMU to some extend.
Edit:
A good ICP-Variant is the GeneralizedIterativeClosestPoint from pcl-registration library.
To create a 3D-Map with a 2D-Sensor (like your Hokuyo), you have to mount the Scanner on a tilt-unit to periodically tilt it up and down. Then PCL can create a pointcloud out of all scans from one full sweep of the scanner.

Thanks for the reply. The sensor i am using is hokuyo UTM 30 LX. I converted 2d laser data to pointcloud data using pcl library. Now if i move hokuyo in upward direction manually with hands then also z=0 and in rviz i see only 2d scan not 3d scan. Can you plz suggest me what should i do next.

And if the solution is ICP algorithm then from where i can study that?
Thanks

I tried the same using "https://github.com/ras-sight/hratc2016_entry_template/wiki/pointcloud_generator_node" this package but when i run launch file, it is asking for tilting action server. i dont know how to write action server for that so i tried "rostopic pub " to move ptu but it doesnot move.

What kind of ptu with what kind of ros-driver do you use?
Comment by ARCHANA on 2016-01-22:
I am using PTU-E46 with flir_ptu_ros drivers. I installed this package from git source.

Hi, sorry to disturb you again. I installed loam_continuous package from git source. Also i download data sets provided i.e bagfile and that is running fine in rviz using command rosbag play. but when i connect hokuyo utm 30lx with my laptop and run that package then i am not able to see 3d pointcld
Comment by ARCHANA on 2016-01-27:
Also there is no error. Can you please tell me what changes i have to make in that package so as to use it for hokuyo utm-30lx.

ARCHANA I also installed loam but point cloud is displayed only with rviz not with loam. Can u guess a possible reason for that ? it will be of great help thank u
