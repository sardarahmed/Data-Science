Q:

Rosjava building test fails

I recently upgraded to the gradle version of rosjava. When I build the test with #./gradlew test I got 16 errors. I checked the report and saw that the following errors occured:
MessageSerializationTest.testBool
MessageSerializationTest.testDuration
MessageSerializationTest.testFloat32
MessageSerializationTest.testFloat64
MessageSerializationTest.testInt16
MessageSerializationTest.testInt32
MessageSerializationTest.testInt64
MessageSerializationTest.testInt8
MessageSerializationTest.testNestedMessage
MessageSerializationTest.testNestedMessageArray
MessageSerializationTest.testString
MessageSerializationTest.testTime
MessageSerializationTest.testUInt16
MessageSerializationTest.testUInt32
MessageSerializationTest.testUInt64
MessageSerializationTest.testUint8

When checking all the errors, it says that the std_msgs/msg/ doesn't exist. (e.g)
"java.util.NoSuchElementException: Resource does not exist: /std_msgs/msg/Bool.msg"
ROS itself is installed and runns smoothly.
I am using ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04LTS.
