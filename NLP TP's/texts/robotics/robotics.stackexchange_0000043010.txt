Q:

ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!

I have been trying to set up a turtle bot for the past couple days. So I went through the instructions found here and made it up to 5.4; when i typed in "rostopic list" into the workstation, it is unable to communicate with master.
ON WORKSTATION
echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
http://192.168.1.101:11311
echo $ROS_HOSTNAME
192.168.1.100
ON LAPTOP
echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
http://192.168.1.100:11311
echo $ROS_HOSTNAME
192.168.1.101
**Laptop IP=**192.168.1.101
**Workstation IP=**192.168.1.100
Any help with resolving this issue would be appreciated. Thanks!

thanks, i changed the ROS_MASTER_URI as you said, but it is still unable to contact master. Any other ideas?

Is the robot running? Did you start roscore? And don't set ROS_HOSTNAME to an ip address. Instead, use the variable ROS_IP.

when i start roscore i get WARNING: ROS_MASTER_URI [http://192.168.1.101:11311] host is not set to this machine

Did you set ROS_IP and unset ROS_HOSTNAME?

i set up the ROS_IP; how do I unset the ROS_HOSTNAME?

A:

There will only be a single ROS master between the 2 machines, which by the given instructions should be on the turtlebot laptop. You should change your ~/.bashrc file on the laptop from:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.100:11311

to:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.101:11311

This assumes that your laptop has the IP 192.168.1.101 and your workstation has the IP 192.168.1.100
