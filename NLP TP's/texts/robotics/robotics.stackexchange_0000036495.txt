A:

The "msg.covariance" field represents the uncertainty in the deterministic field "msg.pose".
This uncertainty is described by a normal distribution centered on the pose field so the probability of the state x follows:  p(x)~ N(msg.pose,msg.covariance)

Of course there is others ways to represent the pose uncertainty. For instance the PoseArray msg (particles) makes possible describing a more complex probabilistic distribution. In any case it has some drawbacks, most of algorithms based on particles usually have less computational efficence.
