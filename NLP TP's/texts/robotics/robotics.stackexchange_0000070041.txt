A:

Hi!,
If you are searching some tutorials to use moveit! you should check the tutorials from the official moveit! website.
If what you are trying to do is some research about how the path planning works in moveit!. You should know that moveit! uses ompl as the default path planner library. So you should search for some documentation about this software.
Anyway if you are new to ROS and want to learn to use it what you should do first is to do the basic tutorials from the wiki, to start learning about the basic concepts, the key to understand the ROS system.
I hope this helps!
