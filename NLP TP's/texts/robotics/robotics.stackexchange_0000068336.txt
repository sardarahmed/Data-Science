Q:

transformPointCloud without PCL

Is there a direct analogue to transformPointCloud that doesn't use PCL but has the same form? i.e.
transformPointCloud(frame, pointcloud2, pointcloud2b, tf)
I am aware of the doTransform function in tf2_sensor_msgs but it is not quite the same.

A:

That is exactly what tf2 is doing  with the transform function of the BufferInterface: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/tf2_ros/html/c++/classtf2__ros_1_1BufferInterface.html
tf2_sensor_msgs is just a package that enables tf2 to transform sensor_msgs (including PointCloud2)
