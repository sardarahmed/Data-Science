Q:

Can i use the navigation stack with my platform?

"The navigation stack can only handle a differential drive and holonomicwheeled
robots. The shape of the robot must be either a square or a rectangle. "
But i have a platform, can move forward,backward and turn to the right and left (i.e. it can't move to the left or right - perpendicular to the length, without facing) . Slam gmapping work well on it.

A:

It sounds like you have a differential drive platform. The nav stack will probably work.
