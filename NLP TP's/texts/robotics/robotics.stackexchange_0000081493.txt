Q:

I ran into dependency problem with building catkin_ws for kitti_to_rosbag package

I am provided with a kitti dataset at  http://kitti.is.tue.mpg.de/kitti/raw_data/2011_09_26_drive_0001/2011_09_26_drive_0001_extract.zip. I have to convert this dataset into rosbag using the package https://github.com/ethz-asl/kitti_to_rosbag. This package require dependencies provided in the link https://github.com/ethz-asl/kitti_to_rosbag/blob/master/kitti_to_rosbag/package.xml. After cloning kitti_to_rosbag package into my ~/cw/src and performing catkin_make in my catkin workspace produces the following error:

CMake Error at kitti_to_rosbag/kitti_to_rosbag/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
By not providing "Findcatkin_simple.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
"catkin_simple", but CMake did not find one. Could not find a package configuration file provided by "catkin_simple" with any
of the following names:         catkin_simpleConfig.cmake     and
catkin_simple-config.cmake

I followed the following commands:

cd ~/cw/src

git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/kitti_to_rosbag

cd ..

catkin_make

In an attempt to rectify this error, I also cloned all dependent packages(catkin_simple, cv_bridge, eigen_checks ...) provided in the package.xml for kitti_to_rosbag into my catkin/src folder. However, it gives this error

No rule to make target '/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libgflags.so', needed by '/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libeigen_checks.so

Any help would be greatly appreciated . Having a deadline for this task, I am open to alternative packages/methods.

A:

Quick answer since you're in a hurry:
It looks like you're missing dependencies. Did you install them? Try to install them with rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y -r from your catkin_ws folder.

After rosdep command and sourcing.It still gives the following error:
No rule to make target '/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libgflags.so', needed by '/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libeigen_checks.so
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1694: recipe for target 'eigen_checks/CMakeFiles/eigen_checks.dir/all' failed

Looks like you need to install gflags and eigen too.
Comment by Cheema on 2017-06-27:
I cloned gflags and eigen into my ~/catkin_ws/src. Is it the right way to"install" these packages?
Your help is greatly appreciated.

No. Install them with apt.
