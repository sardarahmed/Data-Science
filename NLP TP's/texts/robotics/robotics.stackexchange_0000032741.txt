Q:

Unable to compile main.cpp for avr_bridge

I have been trying to follow the "Hello Tutorial" for avr_bridge, and when I run "make" after creating main.cpp, I get this error message:
uav@UAV-PC-2:~/ros_tutorials/avr_bridge_callResponse$ make

A:

Hi,
avr_bridge is in the middle of being phased out in favor of the new, soon to be released/announced rosserial pkg.  We are in the middle writing the documentation for rosserial which you can find here.  You should be able to use most of the documentation by the end of today.
Anyway, it looks like your cmake file is just incorrect or you havent generated the avr_ros files.  However, I wouldn't spend any time working with avr_bridge.  I will actually be deleting the avr_bridge repo next week after we formally announce rosserial.
