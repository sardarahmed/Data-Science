Q:

RVIZ visualize the data in the different plane. How to fix that?

I have set up an environment in gazebo with Kinect sensor. Sensor position and the joint is fine.
But I visualize the pointcloud data in Rviz it is showing in XZ plane instead of XY plane. Take a look at the following image
.
In the image above, it is capturing the image from the front in gazebo but showing on the top of the robot in Rviz.
I tried to put the static transform between frames.
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="kinect_frame" args="0 0 0 -1.58 0 -1.58  /middle_link /kinect_link 100" />
But its conflicting with the transform published by robot_state_publisher.
<link name="kinect_link">
    <inertial>
      <mass value="0.1"/>
      <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0"/>
      <!--The 3x3 rotational inertia matrix. -->
       <inertia ixx="0.0000282916666667" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="0.0000282916666667" iyz="0" izz="0.00005625"/>
    </inertial>
    <visual>
      <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0"/>
      <geometry>
            <mesh filename="package://simbha_model/urdf/meshes/kinect.stl" scale="0.001 0.001 0.001"/>
        </geometry>
      <material name="Black"/>
    </visual>
        <collision>
      <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0"/>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder length="0.065" radius="0.005"/>
      </geometry>
   <material name="Black"/>
    </collision>
  </link>
<joint name="kinect_link_joint" type="fixed">
    <parent link="middle_link"/>
    <child link="kinect_link"/>
    <origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0.075 0.0 0.155"/>
  </joint>

How to set the kinect frame???

Try setting the rpy (roll pitch yaw) of the kinect_link_joint in your urdf.

I tried but that changed view(other than front) also. even in gazebo model, the same issue is there.

A:

Finally, I Solved the problem by myself. I created a dummy link on which Kinect plugin was attached and then in the launch file use robot_sttae_publisher and static_tranform between dummy link and kinect_link.
I changed the static transform in such a way it solved my issue
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="kinect_frame" args="0 0 0 -1.58 0 -1.58 /kinect_link /kinect_tf_link 100" />

Here kinect_link is the dummy link and kinect_tf_link is the link on which Kinect plugin is attached
