Q:

[Eclipse] /.../fuerte_workspace/.../talker: error while loading shared libraries: libxmlrpcpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file

Hi all,
I just run a simple talker.cpp in eclipse. When I run using binary file, the terminal shows
/home/quocmd/fuerte_workspace/sanbox/beginner_tutorials/bin/talker: error while loading shared libraries: libxmlrpcpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I also tried in ubuntu terminal, it can run well. How could I resolve it. My eclipse is Photon version.

You tagged this question with melodic, but your path shows fuerte_workspace. That doesn't match.
Can you please clarify which of the two ROS versions you are using, and why there is a fuerte_workspace there?

Hi it is just the name of my folder, but I use melodic version, guy! And I already figured out the solution, add LD_PATH_LIB=opt/ros/melodic/lib in Environment of Run as Configuration. :)

If you can post that as an answer, then you can accept your own answer and that will clearly show future visitors that your issue was resolved.

Hi,
I'm facing a similar issue even after adding LD_PATH_LIB to my environment variables in my catkin_workspace.
Pls help me with the same.
I'm using ros melodic on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine.
error while loading shared libraries: libxmlrpcpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
echo $LD_PATH_LIB
/opt/ros/melodic/lib
