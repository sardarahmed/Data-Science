Q:

TurtleBot BringUp Errors

Hi everyone, (Warning: I'm new to TurtleBot, ROS, and UBUNTU)
I'm having trouble bringing up my TurtleBot. I installed Ubuntu 11.04 Natty and ROS on my Laptop/TurtleBot and my Workstation. I setup the network settings, but skipped making a VPN. I made it as far as SSH-ing into my Laptop/TurtleBot.
Here is my Play by Play

Turn on Laptop, log in, close lid, plug into TurtleBot/Kinect, turn on iCreate

Turn on Workstation, open terminal,

type: ssh turtlebot@192.168.2.106

type: sudo service turtlebot start

ERROR MSG: turtlebot: unrecognized service

I also get an error when I attempt to bring up the TurtleBot Dashboard

Does anyone know where I should start in fixing these issues?

A:

If you didn't use the TurtleBot ISO to install your laptop the service is not automatically installed. To install the service:
roscd turtlebot_bringup/upstart

Now install the service by running the install script. (the README file in the directory will also give you tips)
sudo ./install.bash

if you are using a special interface like tethering to an android tablet or using openvpn then you can provide the interface in the command line:
sudo ./install.bash interface(i.e. tun0 or usb0)

For the dashboard you need to install and run that on your workstation or run ssh with x-forwarding use the '-X' option.
