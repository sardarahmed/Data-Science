Q:

Calibration of Realsense R200 camera

Hi all, I would like to ask is it possible to calibrate the infrared (IR) camera for the realsense r200 camera as I am using the camera to detect obstacle through the use of disparity map.

The driver already gives you a depth image, wouldn't it be better just to convert the pointcloud to a disparity image?

A:

The camera is factory calibrated and for many purposes this calibration should be good enough. If you really want to, you could calibrate both IR cams as described in StereoCalibration, however.
