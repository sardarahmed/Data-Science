Q:

ROS_WARN not able to print std::string

Dear All,
I want to print in a ROS WARNING a string. But I am not able to do that.
Someone of you could help me please?
What I am doing is the following:

std::string topicNameTrajInput ="TopicRos";
ROS_WARN(topicNameTrajInput);

Any ideas why this doesn't work?
Thanks a lot.

A:

ROS_WARN behaves like printf so for a std::string it'd be something like:
ROS_WARN( "%s", topicNameTrajInput.c_str() ); // (Format string and args for the format string)

I'd suggest use use the easier ROS_WARM_STREAM for a std::string, it behaves like std::cout, e. g.:
ROS_WARN_STREAM( topicNameTrajInput );

or with << operator and multiple args :
ROS_WARN_STREAM( topicNameTrajInput << " Hello world " << 1000 );
