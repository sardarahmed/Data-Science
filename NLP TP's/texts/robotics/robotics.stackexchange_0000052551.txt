Q:

Set rosparam for ~ handle

Hi!
i'm using code
ros::NodeHandle ph("~");
ph.param("scale_angular", a_scale, a_scale);
ph.param("scale_linear", l_scale, l_scale);

How could i set scale_angular from console via rosparam utility?
Thanks!

A:

rosparam set NODE_NAME/scale_angular VALUE
or when starting you node pass _scale_angular:=VALUE.
