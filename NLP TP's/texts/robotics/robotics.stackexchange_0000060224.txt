Q:

groovy-devel, hydro-devel, different git branches architecture question

Maybe this is a really general question about git and branches and i could put it somewhere else (stackoverflow) but I would like to know for the developers that are using hydro-devel and groovy-devel (for example) how do you synchronize changes one branch and another. Do you use something like cherry-picking to select exactly what files to synchronize? Can you even use the cherry-picking for merging??? So, what's the usual standard that you use? the question is mainly because when you develop something for some branch and you want to put that utility to the other branch, (i think) you won't do rebase, you will try to merge only some specific files which are not going to mess up some others.
Thanks!

A:

Yes, the standard way to port code from one development branch to another is to use cherry-pick. Well constructed commits will usually cherry-pick betwen branches relatively easily.
You cannot use merge unless you want all changes. Generally merging is only done to bring feature branches/pull-requests into a development branch and never for crossing between forked development branches.
rebase is super powerful and can be used in many ways. However if the content is already available to others in a public branch it should not be used. It's really for cleaning up local branches/development before pushing content.
