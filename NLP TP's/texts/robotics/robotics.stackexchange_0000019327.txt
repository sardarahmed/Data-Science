Q:

How to configure a DC power distribution bus

If you have a distributed system of DC motors, sensors and microcontrollers, is power usually distributed over a single high volt bus, using DC converters where needed?  Or is it typical to implement separate power buses for each device class?
Maximum cable length from battery to device is about 1 meter, 12 V, 5 V and 3.3 V will be needed depending on the device.
What's used in practice, like in industrial equipment or large robot arms?

A:

Electrical cables and connectors are a very common failure point in distributed electro-mechanical systems. So minimizing the number of wires and connectors is often a priority. In which case a single high voltage line distributes power to all the nodes and each one converts it down to the voltages it needs locally. Switched DC-DC converters are so common and cheap now that the cost reasons for having separate central supplies for each voltage level are no longer valid.
However, motors add noise to the power supply system and, depending on machine design, can also add a large amount of power draw (voltage*amperage) to the power supply. You will need to address these issues if you use a single bus. Motor capacitors and regenerative voltage shunt circuits are your friend for this. Also a clean wiring design that minimizes RF and inductive noise.
