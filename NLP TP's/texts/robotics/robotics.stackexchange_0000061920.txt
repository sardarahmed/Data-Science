Q:

Depth image on amcl_demo

Hi!
I'm having some trouble while trying to access the kinect depth image using amcl_demo.
When i run roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch it works well, and i can access/see topic /camera/depth/image.
The problem is when i run roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo map_file:=/... It starts all the nodes from the camera (the topic is there as well) but i can't see the depth image from the same topic before. I think i need to enable something but don't know what to do.
Hope you can help.
Thank you!

A:

I would check the launch file at turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.alunch and see if the parameter depth_registration is true. In general, setting depth_registration to true when running roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch (which is launched via amcl_demo.launch) will kill the regular camera/depth/image, and vice versa.
After launching amcl_demo.launch, try rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure and select /camera/driver from the drop-down menu. When the depth_registration checkbox is checked, then camera/depth_registered/image_raw should display correctly, but not camera/depth/image. Unchecking it should swap it back.
