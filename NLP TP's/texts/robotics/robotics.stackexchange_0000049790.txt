Q:

RoboEarth rosmake error (updated)

(version 1) Ubuntu 10.04; ROS Electric; rosmake roboearth gives error. This problem cannot be solved even by downgrading the svn.
(version 2) Hence, I upgraded my system to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS; ROS Fuerte; also before rosmake, I install this: sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
Now, the problem is missing knowrob_cad_models but I cannot sudo apt-get install nor rosdep install it.

A:

The main developer Daniel Di Marco has updated the rosinstall file. In addition, the followings are required before rosmake:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-knowrob
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
Perhaps someone should modify the ROS wiki.
