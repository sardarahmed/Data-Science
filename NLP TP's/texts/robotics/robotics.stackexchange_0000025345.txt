Q:

gazebo default directory and can not insert model

where is the gazebo difault directory,I use virtualbox run ros and gazebo, I can only insert the default model from its default directory, and must use "sudo" command to modify the model file.so when I follow tutorial 'build a robot' , I can't insert the model from my created directory, why? Please help me.
In the tutorial 'build a robot', after creating ~/.gazebo/models/manifest.xml file and ~/.gazebo/models/my_robot/model.sdf file, but I can not insert it , because I can not find the file and gazebo only can insert .model file, why? how to solute it?
gazebo_models,but I find the example model in the opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/share/model, how can I change the default directory to my created directory  ~/.gazebo/models/

thanks

A:

Answered it earlier, i suggest just posting one question?
You can set the default directories for models using (go sudo gedit ~/.bashrc and add this for example)
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=path/to/models 

For world files gazebo looks in your current directory (i think) and the resource path.
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=path/to/worlds.

But you can always all this path stuff by creating a world file completely without inserts, yourworld.sdf
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<gazebo version="1.2">
  <world name="default">
     <model name="yourmodel">
        <link name='yourlink'>
         <self_collide>false</self_collide>
          <pose>0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.000 0.000 0.000</pose>

          <collision name='yourlink'>
            <geometry>
            <box><size>0.6 0.5 0.34</size></box>
            </geometry>                 
          </collision>
          <visual name='yourlink'>
          <geometry>
             <box><size>0.6 0.5 0.34</size></box>
          </geometry>
        </visual>
      </link>    
     </model>
  </world>
</gazebo>

Save it as yourmodel.sdf. Then go in prompt and type gazebo yourmodel.sdf (in that directory)

it looks like lugd1229 is using ros, in which case the export commands wouldn't work right?
Comment by lugd1229 on 2012-11-09:
yes ,I use simulator_gazebo ,then I try to use plain gazebo, maybe it is more simple. thank you.

Ah yes, i missed the ROS in the first sentence. I guess it won't work.
