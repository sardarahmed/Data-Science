Q:

Bad KinematicMsg.msg in stdr_simulator

Does anyone else have the problem in indigo that stdr_msgs/KinematicMsg.msg is incomplete? All its contents but string type seem to have been removed.

http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_indigo_default.html?q=stdr_msgs is actually release for indigo in Saucy and Trusty, but does not contain the noise parameters. They got introduced in commit f13540d6cb45370de6b41d8. Maybe you should try from source...

Ubuntu 14.04. I installed via apt-get ros-indigo-stdr-simulator. When I do that, the KinematicMsg is empty except for one string value. I've tried multiple times. The error is easily reproducible.

A:

The stdr_msgs/KinematicMsg.msg released into indigo is, at the time of this writing, containing only this data.
The noice values are only introduced in commit f13540d6cb45370de6b41d8 (see here) on May 21st 2015, which is not released yet. The last release originates from July 25th 2014.
So, you need to install an overlay of this repository from source, to use those values...
