Q:

When optimizing the DWA local planner, is there a way to get the the total cost assocaited from APIs or from the parameter server?

I am trying to automate the parameter selection for DWA, for this I need to have the cost function value, is there a way to obtain this?

A:

DWA does not publish the costs associated with the trajectories it selects explicitly. (You can get some of it from the cost_cloud topic but its indirect)
One of the motivating factors behind the way I designed dwb_local_planner was the desire to get that information explicitly. (slides and video here)
