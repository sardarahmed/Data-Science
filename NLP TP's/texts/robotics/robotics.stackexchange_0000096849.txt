Q:

Generic Subscriber in ROS2

I am looking to replicate ROS1 behaviour where I could use ShapeShifter to subscribe to any topic, and not have to specify the message type. This code would run in C++.
I have found this Pull Request but it seems nothing has yet come of this.
Does anyone know if this is possible in ROS2 using C++? If not C++, then Python?
Many thanks

A:

Not completely what are looking for, but here is one way to do in Python. In Python, you can use get_msg_class from ros2topic.api to get the message type and then subscribe to the topic. Here is an example:
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from ros2topic.api import get_msg_class

class TestSubscriber(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('test_subscriber')
        message_type = get_msg_class(self, '/topic_name', include_hidden_topics=True)
        print('Message type:', message_type)
        self.create_subscription(message_type, '/topic_name', self.on_message_received, 1)

    def on_message_received(self, message):
        print(message)

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    test_subscriber = TestSubscriber()
    rclpy.spin(test_subscriber)
    test_subscriber.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Test it by running e.g.:
ros2 topic pub /topic_name std_msgs/String '{ data: test_value }'

This is awesome, thanks! Such as a shame the C++ api is not there yet.
