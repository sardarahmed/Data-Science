Q:

content of a node's publications

I am playing around with the navigation stack and turtlebot and trying to debug the errors I get. Especially the topic /tf where many nodes are publishing transformations. How to know from which node is which transformation? Is there something like rostopic echo that allows to echo nodes coming from a preselected node?
When I run rosrun tf tf_monitor all I get is :

Frame: pole_middle_3_link published by
unknown_publisher Average Delay: -0.5
Max Delay: 0

for all published transforms.

I remember that there's somewhere the information about the publisher in the message, but don't remember the exact name or position of it. This has been asked a several time here. All answers said that this information should only be used to debug. I don't think rostopic can do that.

any suggestion about keywords to search about old questions?

A:

Found the link: http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers#Connection_Information
You have to write your own little node that prints the publishers.
Please note the comment on this site:

We do not recommend using callerid information beyond debugging purposes, as it can lead to brittle code in an anonymous publish/subscribe architecture.
