Q:

Not Seeing Robot in rviz

I'm working through the URDF Tutorial and one of the first things to do is to load a example file, 01-myfirst.urdf, into rviz for visualization.  So I load the example file as is, run the rviz launch file, rviz opens up, and the rviz grid is empty -- no robot!
I do get a warning message in rviz that says:
No tf data. Actual error: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist  

What does this mean?  What's missing?  Why can't I see the robot?
P.S.  I'm running Hydro.

I would think this is a duplicate of no robot visible in rviz for urdf tutorial.
