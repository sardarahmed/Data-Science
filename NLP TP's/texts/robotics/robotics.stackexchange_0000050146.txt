Q:

How to pause one node while a specific argument (rostopic) is active

Need suggestions to pause a face tracking system when a specific argument from another topic is active. The current code is written in python.
Example of what I want to do:
while (rostopic /robotsound/arg != "/home/user/workspace/audio/resources/good_audio.wav")
     face_track_system()

Any ideas?

Just subscribe the topic and set a flag to call face_track_system() in your code depending on that value.
