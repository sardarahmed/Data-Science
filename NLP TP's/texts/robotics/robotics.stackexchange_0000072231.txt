Q:

How do I get the pose estimated by AMCL at a fixed rate?

Hi everybody,
I'd like to know if there is a way to get the 2D pose estimates by AMCL at a fixed rate as is the case for the Hector SLAM in which the topic poseupdate provides the pose estimates at 40Hz with the Hokuyo UTM-30LX.
Thanks in advance!

A:

Afaik, not without modifying the code, as amcl running frequency is marked by the /scan messages arrival. Even then, you normally see lower frequencies because if update_min_d/update_min_a parameters are >= 0, it skip scans until the robot moves/turns more than these values (with negative values, amcl publishes poses even when the robot is stopped.

Thank you for your reply Jorge.
I set update_min_d/update_min_a with negative values but I get the following error
Transform [sender=unknown_publisher]
For frame [laser]: No transform to fixed frame [map].
This error does not occur if the two parameters are positive.

mmm.... I noticed that by inspecting the code, tried it on Stage simulation and it worked... which ROS version are you using?
