Q:

Adding an image publishing node to the android_tutorial_image_transport

Hi guys,
I am wondering about how to add an image publisher to original image_transport tutorial project in order to publish the images from Android camera?
Here are some ideas I've tried but have not succeeded:

Use RosCameraPreviewView (like the android_camera_tutorial did) inside the MainActivity class by adding the second nodeConfiguration
Use CompressedImagePublisher from org.ros.android.view.camera.
Write rosjava publisher from scratch as this link

Any idea or suggestion would be much appreciated!
Cheers

Hi @hulkbv, would you mind detailing why you failed using CompressedImagePublisher from android.view.camera ?

A:

Hi @jubeira,
I made it work on the weekend. The mistake I made is that I forgot to setCamera and releaseCamera (due to the lack of android dev experience), these methods come from CameraPreviewView. Anw, thanks for asking :)
