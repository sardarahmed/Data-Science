Q:

Securing ROS Based Robots & The Cloud

Hi all,
I'm interested in building a series of ROS based robots that will need to be connected to some form of cloud based storage. This is to query user parameters (someone will be able to sign up for an account, and when they walk up to our robot, like a kiosk, they'll be able to log in and have a customized experience). I saw this post, and am trying to design the best way to protect user data. This user data would be stored during execution as parameters. The sensor data would be stored in a bag, compressed and stored on this cloud storage instance.
Since no actual computation is being distributed, and the ROS system and cloud system will never interact directly, is there a way to lock down the port of the ROS_MASTER_URI, so that it can only be used internally? Thanks!

Can't you just block the outbound traffic from the master with an internal firewall?
