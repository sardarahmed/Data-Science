Q:

Can not totally remove ROS

I installed ROS once before and then removed it, probably the wrong way.
Now I've been trying to install other software packages but I had the following error:
dpkg: error processing package ros-kinetic-actionlib-tutorials (--configure):
 package is in a very bad inconsistent state; you should
 reinstall it before attempting configuration
Errors were encountered while processing:
 ros-kinetic-actionlib-tutorials
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

I tried to remove ROS completely by following these commands but it didn't work.
I tried reinstalling ROS following these constructions but I had the following error:
dpkg: error processing package ros-kinetic-desktop-full (--configure):
 dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
Errors were encountered while processing:
 ros-kinetic-actionlib-tutorials
 ros-kinetic-common-tutorials
 ros-kinetic-desktop
 ros-kinetic-desktop-full
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

How can I totally remove it?
Thanks
