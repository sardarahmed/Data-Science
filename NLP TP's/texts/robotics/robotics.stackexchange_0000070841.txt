Q:

Generate odom from command velocity

Hello,
I modified a RC car (a big one) for driving it. Nowadays I made my own controller for sending the data to the car so now I'm able to teleoperate it and I have mounted on it a kinect so now I'm able to receive the image from it.
Right now I want to navigate with it using AMCL (I already have a map made with the turtlebot) but the problem is that I don't have any odometry so I'm thinking about generate my own one transforming the cmd_vel into odom msg
I don't have any idea about where I should start from. Do you have any idea?
Thanks you in advance.

Yes, I already knew that, but at the moment is the only way that I have for doing it. Anyway, thank you for your help, I'm gonna continue looking into it.

Look at the "Hector SLAM" package, that allows you to do visual odometry and navigation

were you able to find a solution?

A:

If you are able to send commands, you can use the commands to create your odometry. Although, in this way you do not consider dynamic of your system. Hopefully amcl compensate for it...
