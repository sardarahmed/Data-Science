Q:

roscore does not initialize

Hey guys,
I'm new to ROS. If I run roscore, it does not initialize, it just gets stuck. If I run strace roscore, after a certain point, I keep seeing the following forever:
select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 100000}) = 0 (Timeout)
select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 100000}) = 0 (Timeout)

Concerning the environmental variables, I have:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/filippo/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=/home/filippo/catkin_ws/devel/share/common-lisp
ROS_DISTRO=kinetic
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/kinetic/etc/ros

The console output is:
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

started roslaunch server http://filippo-HP-ENVY-17-Notebook-PC:43155/

Please show the console output for when you run it too.

Please edit your question when you have updates. I've added the console output to your question for you.

This is what starting up roscore is supposed to do; it will keep running and won't print a new prompt until you stop it.

A:

It looks like your roscore has started and is successfully running. That is the same output that I see when I run roscore. It is just waiting for an incoming connection.
Now that you've started the ROS master using roscore. You need to launch a node. I'd recommend going through the ROS tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials
