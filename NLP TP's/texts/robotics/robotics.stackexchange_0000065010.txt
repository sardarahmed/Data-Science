A:

This page seems to explain the benefits of using ROS fairly well: http://www.ros.org/is-ros-for-me/
As a company producing a robot, ROS has a few major benefits:

Increased developer productivity through modular design and reusability
It's a good way to provide a user-facing API, if you want users to write programs which run on your robot.
Permissive licensing
