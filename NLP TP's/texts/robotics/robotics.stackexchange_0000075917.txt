Q:

creating a other topic in rviz display plugin

Hey,
i created a new Display Plugin for Rviz but i wanted to to create an other topic to return some information.
Because i have no argv and argc arguments i cant do ros::init ... and if i just create a new ros::NodeHandle this works sometimes fine ... but i guess if nothing is displayed it stops on ros::spineOnce() is this normal or is the problem somewhere else in my code?
so the main question is what is the right way to create a new Topic in a rviz display plugin?

A:

rviz calls ros::init() and will handle spinning. I think you just need to create a node handle and then create a subscriber from that node handle. You shouldn't need to do anything else.

In fact, the Display class has 2 protected NodeHandle members already, threaded_nh_ (non-GUI thread) and update_nh_ (GUI thread).
