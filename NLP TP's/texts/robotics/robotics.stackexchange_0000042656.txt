Q:

RGBDSLAM fails rosmake and rosdep in fuerte

I am trying to use rgbdslam in fuerte on 12.04 LTS. I was able to overcome some problems, like the dependency on eigen by following these directions.
Now I am having a different error.
bowser@bowser-ros:~/fuerte_workspace$ rosdep install rgbdslam
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rgbdslam: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [gl2ps]

I tried to install the packages as described in the link, but they were already up to date. Rosmake also fails with following error:
    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lGLEW
      /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lIL
      collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
      make[1]: *** [siftgpu] Error 1
      make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/bowser/fuerte_workspace/rgbdslam/external/siftgpu/linux'
      
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:103 (MESSAGE):
        SiftGPU cannot be compiled.  Returned: 2

  
  
  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

the full build_output.log is here.
I am trying to learn more about SiftGPU to figure out what problem could be, but I'm not really sure where to look right now, or if siftgpu itself is the problem, or if I'm missing some other dependency.

A:

Seems like you lack a dependency of SiftGPU. Either search on http://packages.ubuntu.com/ for a package containing libGLEW and libIL or disable it at the top of CMakeLists.txt.

Is this a bug in rgbdslam? The bugs link on the stack page is broken: http://ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam_freiburg
Comment by Felix Endres on 2012-07-30:
rgbdslam doesn't support fuerte yet (and will not until at least september), so I don't consider this a bug I can fix yet. I don't know what is wrong with that page, do you? It definitely is indexed, since ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam comes from a subdirectory. Maybe a problem with the stack.xml?
