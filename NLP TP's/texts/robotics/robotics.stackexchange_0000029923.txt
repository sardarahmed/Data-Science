Q:

using smach with actionlib

When using smach with actionlib actions, am I correct in saying that smach acts as the action client for the action server? So I don't need a separate action client anymore?

A:

That is correct, if you use a simple action state Smach will construct the action client for you.
Similarly, when you create a action server wrapper for a Smach container, Smach will construct the action server for you.
