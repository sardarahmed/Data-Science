Q:

Is there any Documenation about the RANGE plugin?(other then the obvious)

Hi,
i'm currently using this plugin: libgazebo_ros_range.so . I have to use this one with predefined params from other robots.
This is the part im using, it works all fine but I'm wondering if there is potential for improvement:
  <plugin filename="libgazebo_ros_range.so" name="gazebo_ros_range">
        <gaussianNoise>0.005</gaussianNoise>
        <alwaysOn>true</alwaysOn>
        <updateRate>5</updateRate>
        <topicName>range/fl</topicName>
        <frameName>range_front_left_frame</frameName>
        <fov>0.1</fov>
        <radiation>ultrasound</radiation>   
   </plugin>

I cant find an proper explanation for all the parameters for example: can i change ultrasound to something else?
Do you guys have an link where i can read more about this plugin?
I looked through the tutorial and couldn't find anything. Also this page couldn't help much, perhaps i'm using the page wrong?
Best Regards,
David

A:

You can find the code for gazebo_ros_range.cpp on github.
More specifically, there is no alwaysOn parameter (you can remove it), and the fov and radiation parameters are only used to initialize the output ros messages (so they don't affect the plugin itself).
