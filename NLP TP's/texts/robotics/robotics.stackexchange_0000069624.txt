Q:

clean message on topic

Hi,
I have a publisher to publish message to one topic at different time. Each time before I publish the new message, how can I clean the messages on the topic published at other time? Thanks.

Why would you need that? After a subscriber receives a message, this message then vanishes. Probably what you actually need in your situation is to use services as they allow to publish messages only on requests.

@VitaliyProoks Because I noticed that the robot didnot stop after publishing (0,0) to topic cmd_vel. I suspect that there  is velocity command on topic cmd_vel published at other time.

A:

Then it looks like it is issue in your robot's code, messaging in ROS works fine :) ROS provides tools for listening to/publishing from topics either from console or by means of rqt_gui try to debug by sending test messages and see what happens.
