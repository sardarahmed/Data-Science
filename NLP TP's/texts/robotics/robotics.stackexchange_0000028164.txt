Q:

Gazebo 7.0.0 crash on heightmap insertion

In Gazebo 7.0.0 if I try to insert an model with a heightmap Gazebo either hangs or closes with a crash. In the following example, I attempt to insert the Appolo15 landing model
Either I'll get
$ gazebo --verbose

Or I might get this this message too
gzclient: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:648: typename boost::detail::sp_member_access<T>::type boost::shared_ptr<T>::operator->() const [with T = gazebo::msgs::Response; typename boost::detail::sp_member_access<T>::type = gazebo::msgs::Response*]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.

Any ideas? Wondering if the easy fix is to uninstall the Gazebo version that ships with ROS and install the latest one.

I have this same exact issue happen on 7.0.0 but it only happens for heightmaps which are 2049 x 2049 or larger. For maps of size 1025 x 2015 and smaller it loads properly.

A:

Actually it might not even be necessary to go that far, I was able to insert heightmaps using Gazebo 7.7. All you need are OSRF keys, and then sudo apt upgrade.
