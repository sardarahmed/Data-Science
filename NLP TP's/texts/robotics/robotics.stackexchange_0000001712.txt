Q:

What is the difference between RC motors for cars and helicopters?

I am working on a robot with focus on speed. At the moment I am looking for a suitable motor but it would help if I understood the difference between the various options.
To provide some background, I have not worked with RC model components before, but I think this is the only place for me to find the components needed for my robot, such as the motor.
I have already figured out how much power the motor needs to accelerate my robot as desired, taking energy conversion efficiency and tractional resistance into account. It's about 170 watts, depending on the final weight.
To limit my search further, I need to decide on either using a RC car motor or a RC helicopter motor now, but I don't understand the difference between these options.
Focussing on brushless motors (if that matters), what are the differences between RC car and RC helicopter motors? What needs to be taken into account when choosing between them?

A:

I think the term you're looking for is outrunner (vs inrunner):

This type of motor spins its outer shell around its windings
[...]
Outrunners spin much slower than their inrunner counterparts with their more traditional layout (though still considerably faster than ferrite motors) while producing far more torque. This makes an outrunner an excellent choice for directly driving electric aircraft propellers since they eliminate the extra weight, complexity, inefficiency and noise of a gearbox.

Inrunners (which are what most people think of when they think of a DC motor) are high-RPM motors with low torque, which usually require some kind of mechanical transmission to be practical.
Quadcopters and other aerial vehicles tend to use outrunners, while R/C cars tend to use inrunners.
