Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Qt Multimedia

I cannot seem to import QtMultimedia widgets and other items into my python script with the following line:
from python_qt_binding.QtMultimedia import *
is QtMultimedia not included in the python_qt_bindings?

A:

It looks like it's listed, but it's optional: https://github.com/ros-visualization/python_qt_binding/blob/kinetic-devel/src/python_qt_binding/binding_helper.py#L69 . I've tried import PyQt4.QtMultimedia but it doesn't work either, so I suspect this is actually QtMultimedia missing from PyQt4
