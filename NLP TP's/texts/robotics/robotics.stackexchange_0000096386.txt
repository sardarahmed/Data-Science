Q:

Creart Gazebo World based on map

Hi guys,
I have the map data (pgm , yaml) created by a laser scan, now I am wondering if I can use this map data to creat a Gazebo Environment (World), I know I can edit an environment in Gazebo and save it as (config and sdf), but I must do it manually, is there an easier way to do ?

Check out this package:
https://github.com/shilohc/map2gazebo
It claims to do exactly what you are asking for.  See also this discussion on ROS Discourse:
