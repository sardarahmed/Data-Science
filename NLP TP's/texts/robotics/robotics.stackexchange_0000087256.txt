Q:

ROS navigation can't rotate 180Â°

hi ,
i'm getting some trouble with the dwa_local planner it's seems that my robot can follow path and avoid obstacle but  when i choose a goal that makes the robot turn in the oposite direction   it starts to turn in place about 60 degrees and then start to move forward and then loose the path , why it's does not turn 90 degrees ?

what does your configuration of base_local_planner look like

A:

i found the problem and it's not the local_planner but there is a lag between laser data and the map , the localization is not good at all

how do you fix this lag? what are the parameters I should be looking at?

my odometry was bad  specially when turning  , have a look to this tutorial  to check if nothing is wrong with your configuration

@aarontan check also your local planner config  , the parameter  max_vel_theta   and  min_in_place_vel_theta   should not be too much  different
