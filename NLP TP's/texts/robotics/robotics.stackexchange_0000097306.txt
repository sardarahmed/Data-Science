Q:

robot_localization state transition equation

What is the state transition equation that is assumed in ekf_localization_node? More specifically, what is f in equation (1) of the paper?
I could potentially parse lines 241+ of the implementation, but that seems quite error prone and unnecessary.
My assumption, since it is used in the Husky robot, is that it assumes a differential drive robot, but I am unfamiliar with what these equations look like in 3-D. And I feel like this should really be documented somewhere.
Thanks!

A:

It uses an omnidirectional motion model. Essentially, just model the thing as a point, and apply newtons laws for positions, velocity, and acceleration in 3D. Tom Moore provides an eloquent answer to this same type of question here.
