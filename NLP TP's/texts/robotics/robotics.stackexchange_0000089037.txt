Q:

Get data from rviz

Hi all, so today I did my first simple work on rviz - projecting depth image data onto the plane using the pointcould display. I am wondering whether theres is way to get the final graph display data from rviz and probably later reproduce the same plot in say MATLAB. I know I can get the depth/image/points message by simply echoing out the topic.
If so, how easiest can I achieve this? Thank you all very much.

A:

RVIZ is just visual tool for displaying ROS messages, therefore getting data from RVIZ means getting data from ROS topic. MATLAB has support for ROS (look here). You should be able to create subscriber (look here) in MATLAB to the given topic and do whatever you want with the data.
