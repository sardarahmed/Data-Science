Q:

starmac simulated_quadrotor a real simulator?

from where does starmac simulated_quadrotor  get its sensordata for simulation ???
are the sensors(acc,gyro,...) modelled in starmac simulator???
Is starmac a real simulation of a quadrokopter???? It is confusing because the simulated_quadrotor  uses RVIZ.But Rviz is only a Vizualisation,as far as i understand.
I want a real Simulation of my selfmade quadrotor.How can i achieve this?
thanks,greets

A:

I just noticed this question while browsing around.. I guess this is related to a posting on the starmac-ros-pkg-users list. Dimitri is correct in his assessment--in my response on the mailing list I went into a bit more detail. The tl;dr version is that simulated_quadrotor simulates just enough to give me enough confidence to try something out on the real quadrotor. So if there's a sign error somewhere in the code that will probably be revealed in the simulator but I wouldn't expect it to reveal anything substantially more subtle than that.
