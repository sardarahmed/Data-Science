Q:

error demo ar_pose

I get following error message when I like to run the demo with
roslaunch ar_pose demo_single.launch
(Link: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ar_pose):
The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'.
(Details: serial 21 error_code 9 request_code 55 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
ERROR [1337029951.548533238]: Client [/ar_pose] wants topic /usb_cam/camera_info to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/c9a58c1b0b154e0e6da7578cb991d214], but our version has [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo/1b5cf7f984c229b6141ceb3a955aa18f]. Dropping connection.

What can I do?
