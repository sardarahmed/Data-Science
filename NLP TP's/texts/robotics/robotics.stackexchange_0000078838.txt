Q:

Tool for building packages and dependencies from source on os x

Hi,
I'm trying brush the cobwebs off my last from-source build of Jade on my mac - Sierra. I wanted to get the entire turtlebot source (turtlebot_gazebo, _teleop, etc  and its dependencies in a workspace and run a single catkin_make to build
Right now I go to the ROS package wiki, clone a package, build, then clone missing packages and go on... until I'm there. most of the time I'm not!
Any thoughts on a ros tool that helps me pull all source packages and dependencies on mac os?
Any help is  much appreciated!

I've tried using rosdep but it crashes with an OSError exception.

That's not enough information to help, OSError is too ambiguous.

A:

You probably want to use rosinstall_generator, see: http://wiki.ros.org/rosinstall_generator
It will get you the complete list of packages you need, recursively, for a given leaf package by looking at its dependencies.

@William $ rosinstall_generator turtle_gazebo --exclude RPP --rosdistro jade
The following not released packages/stacks will be ignored: turtle_gazebo
No packages/stacks left after ignoring not released
Any reason for this? turtle_gazebo is not in my RPP

My bad... typo in package name
Comment by William on 2017-02-08:
No worries, that error either means: it's not released, or it's not in your RPP, or it's a typo :)
