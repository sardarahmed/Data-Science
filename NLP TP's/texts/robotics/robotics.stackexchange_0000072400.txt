Q:

How to change the topic name for publishing occupancy grid using map_server?

Intent : Using mapstitch_hector to get the position of the bot as well as stitching maps.
Problem : Two sets of data are required for mapstitch_hector - /world and /align - in OccupancyGrid format
Data in hand : two sets of .pgm and .yaml files for /world and /align. Acquired via map_saver
Current target : wanted to publish the OccupancyGrids using map_server by the topic /world and /align.
Question : How can I modify the topic for map_server publish? or are there any better idea?
Thank you viewers

A:

You need to remap the map and map_metadata topics from map_server to what you need, i.e. to world and world_metadata.
Depending on whether you are using roslaunch or rosrun, there are different ways.
Use the <remap ...> tag for roslaunch.
If you use rosrun, add the following:
rosrun map_server map_server mymap.yaml /map:=/world /map_metadata:=/world_metadata.
