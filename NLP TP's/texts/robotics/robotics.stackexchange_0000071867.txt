Q:

Programms to calibrate depth_image from kinect

I try to find programs to get the values for the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters but RGBDemo has old ubuntu-package  dependencies (have (14.04)) I cannot solve and Matlab toolbox from Herrera is quite complicated. Any suggestions? What I want to end up with is a proper yaml-file or at least with the parameters to fill in like shown in the camer_calibration_parsers wiki.
 EDIT I used D. Herrera and Burrus's data for depth monocular calibration and I ended up with:
    image_width: 640    //Region of Interest
    image_height: 480
    camera_name: depth_A70774V01752221A     //@change Seriennummer anpassen
    camera_matrix:  // = Matrix K beinhaltet Intrinsik
      rows: 3
      cols: 3
      data: [594.25, 0, 339.79, 0, 592.48, 242.50, 0, 0, 1]
    distortion_model: plumb_bob     //Lochkamera-Modell
    distortion_coefficients:    // Entzerrungs-Vektor k
      rows: 1
      cols: 5
      data: [-0.26167, 0.99319, -0.00102, 0.00536, -1.29664]
    rectification_matrix:   // Rotations-Matrix  !not R
      rows: 3
      cols: 3
      data: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
    projection_matrix:      //  Matrix [mod(K)|t]
      rows: 3
      cols: 4
      data: [594.25, 0, 339.79, 0, 592.48, 242.50, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

maybe an update to the wiki for kinect is a good idea

A:

The openni_launch package has several tutorials on calibrating the Kinect. These include finding the intrinsic calibration parameters for the RGB and IR sensors, and an extrinsic calibration for better registration between depth and IR cameras.
