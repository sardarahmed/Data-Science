Q:

Ros node does not recognize Haptic device

I am developing a ros node for reading Force Dimension Omega.x haptic device input.
I downloaded the Force Dimension SDK, compiled the libraries and exported them in /usr/local/lib while copied the headers in /usr/local/include. Then I modified CMakeLists.txt and package.xml to link those files. My code is building correctly now, but I can't connect to my haptic device. Since with other non-ros packages (e.g. Chai3D) I had to specify "sudo" for running a bin and for connecting to the haptic device properly, my question is: How I can run a ros node and connect to my device?
I am developing my code in QtCreator.
Looking forward for your help.
Thanks

A:

I finally find out how to access to usb without typing sudo.
First of all, I create a new file in /etc/udev/rules.d named 10-mydevice.rules and added this line inside:
ATTRS{idProduct}=="[PRODUCT_ID]", ATTRS{idVendor}=="[VENDOR ID]", MODE="666", GROUP="plugdev"

where VENDOR_ID and PRODUCT_ID are specified by
lsusb -v

Then I simply checked if my user was part of plugdev group by typing
groups USERNAME

Finally I saved and closed my file and entered the following in the terminal window for refreshing the rules:
sudo udevadm trigger

Right now I can run my node by using rosrun without root privileges or run the node from inside QtCreator!!!
Hope this could help other people!
