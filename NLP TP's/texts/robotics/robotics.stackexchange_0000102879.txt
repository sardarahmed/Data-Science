Q:

colcon build error: can't copy 'resource/': doesn't exist or not a regular file

I am using ROS2 Humble in Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS.
This is very surprising to me. Until yesterday the package (beaming: I am making this package for my robot) was building fine. But today when I tried doing a colcon build it fails with the following error:
Starting >>> beaming 
 stderr: beaming                   
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/setuptools/command/install.py:34: SetuptoolsDeprecationWarning: setup.py install is deprecated. Use build and pip and other standards-based tools.
  warnings.warn(
error: can't copy 'resource/beaming': doesn't exist or not a regular file
Failed   <<< beaming [1.37s, exited with code 1]

Summary: 0 packages finished [2.06s]
  1 package failed: beaming
  1 package had stderr output: beaming

I made sure that I was sourcing the workspace before doing the colcon build.
I found this issue similar to mine but the same error shows up even after deleting build/ and install/ directories as proposed in the solutions.
Is this is an issue with the colcon tool or something local in my workspace? How do I fix this?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I solved this problem. It was pretty trivial and silly.
All I had to do was make a directory resource/ in the place where setup.py and package.xml exists and create an empty file inside the resource/ directory with the name same as the package name.
I might have not included this directory when I did a git add. Hence, when I cloned this package I faced this error. I would still like to know the purpose of the resource/ directory.
