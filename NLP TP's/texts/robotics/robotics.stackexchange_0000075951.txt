A:

You may refer to this
https://github.com/code-iai/iai_robots/blob/master/iai_kinect2_description/urdf/kinect2.urdf.xacro

EDIT
The URDF of kinect is just for displaying in RViz or Gazebo, in my opinion. The only thing meaningful is the tf base_link->kinect2_frame. The complicated kinect1.urdf is just for good-looking.
Well, I think someone will perfect it someday.

I have a look at it, the kinect2.urdf.xacro file is very simple, only one link,like:

I don't know whether it is good enough to build a model for a robot.
The urdf of kinect1 in turtlebot project is not so simple.
