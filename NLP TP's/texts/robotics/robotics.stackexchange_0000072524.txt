Q:

Why my computer suddenly need such a long time to start uwsim

Why my computer suddenly need such a long time to start uwsim? It could start uwsim very fast before. But now it needs over ten minutes. I used rosclean command but it is not helpful. I don't know why.

Hi,
That is the reason why. Resource retriever tries to connect to internet. If your internet connection is faulty it takes some time as every 3D model loaded calls the resource retriever. I suggest solving connection problems or just disable it.
