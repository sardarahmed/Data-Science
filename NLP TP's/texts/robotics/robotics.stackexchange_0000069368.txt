Q:

Couldn't find executable named tf_brodcaster below

Hi all,
I am new to ROS
My question is similar to a previous question asked.
I am following the tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF
And I am stuck with the robot_setup_tf part. Whereby I run the command
rosrun robot_setup_tf tf_broadcaster

Initially I get
package robot_setup_tf not found

I have tried the sourcing the setup.bash file in my catkin_ws/devel, (From the 1st link)
source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

It solves the previous error, however, now I get a new error
Couldn't find executable named tf_brodcaster below /home/user1/catkin_ws/src/robot_setup_tf

I am running on ROS indigo. Would appreciate assistance!
Thanks alot in advance!

A:

"Couldn't find executable named tf_brodcaster below [..]"

Is this an actual copy/paste? Because there is a typo there: it's tf_broadcaster, not tf_brodcaster (note the missing a).
