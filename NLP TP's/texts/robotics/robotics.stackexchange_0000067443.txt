Q:

Is there a Russian translation of the website and wiki?

I know that many developers from Russia used the ROS, but unfortunately there is no material translated into Russian. Is it interesting for Community to have a translation of the site and other materials into local languages? I still found the translation in French, German, Japanese and so on. Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian do not see, but it's a huge audience of developers.
With Best regards,
Wagan Sarukhanov
