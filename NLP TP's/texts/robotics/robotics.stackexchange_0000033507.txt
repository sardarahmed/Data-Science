Q:

rewriting python program in cpp, how to fill in the header field in msg

Hi all,
I am reading the pr2_controllers/Tutorials/Moving the arm through a Cartesian pose trajectory.
At the end of this tutorial, there is a test client program written in python, which send Cartesian trajectories to the service. I got a problem when I was trying to rewrite it in c++.
  13 #execute a Cartesian trajpr2_controllersTutorialsMoving the arm through a Cartesian pose trajectoryectory defined by a root frame, a list of 
  14 #positions (x,y,z), and a list of orientations (quaternions: x,y,z,w)
  15 def call_execute_cartesian_ik_trajectory(frame, positions, orientations):
  16     rospy.wait_for_service("execute_cartesian_ik_trajectory")
  17 
  18     #fill in the header (don't need seq)
  19     header = roslib.msg.Header()
  20     header.frame_id = frame
  21     header.stamp = rospy.get_rostime()

Here the header was filled, I am not sure if I need to do the same thing in c++ and if so, what's the corresponding code that I should be using?
Maybe a very basic question, but I just couldn't find the answer and very confused.
Can someone help me with this? Thank you.

A:

The corresponding code for filling a header would be:
srv.header.frame_id = frame;
srv.header.stamp = ros::Time::now();

In the above, instead of 'frame' you can fill a string constant as like below:
srv.header.frame_id = "your_frame";
