Q:

negativ update rate in .world file

Hi guys, what does a negativ update rate in a .world file mean?
i was told that the simulation then runs as far as possible in order to provide nearly realtime simulation.But i cant find a documentation or explanation in ros or ODE. Is that true? Where can i find a documentation about that??
physics:ode

A:

Yes, this is the case. See for example these two tickets on problems with the framerate locking mechanism (that should be fixed now): 1,2
Update Rate settings are also documented on the (old) gazebo problem resolution guide.
