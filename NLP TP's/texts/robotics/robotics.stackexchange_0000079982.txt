Q:

sudo apt install catkin not working

Hi, I'm a newbie, so sorry if this is really obvious. I'm following the Tutorials instructions having just installed ROS on Ubuntu Mate. The current step says

$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
>     $ catkin_make

but when I enter "catkin_make" terminal returns

The program 'catkin_make' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install catkin

So I do that, and get

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 catkin : Depends: python-catkin-pkg but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

It then ends at that. How can I fix this and continue with the tutorials?

what ROS distro are you using????

A:

Basically, going through the basic tutoril  again making sure to run through all the steps as @bonzi suggests is good.

The program 'catkin_make' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install catkin

Unintuitive though, this error can also happen when your terminal can't find the command in directories in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
So make sure ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set appropriately (e.g. by source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash etc.)
