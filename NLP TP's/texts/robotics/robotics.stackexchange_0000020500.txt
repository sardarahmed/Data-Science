Q:

What is the difference between the holding torque and stall torque of a motor?

Do the terms holding torque and stall torque imply the same thing? The information on torque for these stepper motors is given as holding torque. While these servo motors have the torque given as stall torque. My hope is to use the maximum torque a motor can handle to compare different motors for a project.

A:

Both holding torque for a stepper motor, and stall torque for a servo motor, refer to the maximum amount of torque when the shaft is not spinning and the windings are fully energized.   A stepper motor also has a detent torque because of its magnet arrangement.  Detent torque is the amount of torque it takes to overcome the magnetic attraction and move a shaft one step from being stopped when the windings are not energized.
