Q:

Kinect Installation and Setup on ROS [Updated]

Do I need any drivers to run the kinect on ROS? I ran sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni* and it downloaded 5mb of files. Then I tried following the tutorial at the wiki but when I ran the first command it said "[ Info] ... No Devices Connected ..." . lsusb shows up with the xbox nui camera and audio and a microsoft device on bus 1.... I'm using the XBOX 360 kinect and power cord from microsoft...
What am I doing wrong here?
Thanks,
Update:
I have a kinect model 1473. Does that make any difference
When I run hsoltani's answer I still get the no devices connected error

A:

I tried a number of things, so not sure what the exact combo that made it work was, but I think this should work:
A) sudo apt-get install ROS-Indigo-OpenNI-Launch (probably similar to what you installed)
B) Use  step 3 from this for the drivers:

C) Play with it:

If that does work, please comment.

But I start from step 2, or it will fail.
