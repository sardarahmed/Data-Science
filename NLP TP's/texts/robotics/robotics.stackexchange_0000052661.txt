Q:

Gazebo 1.9 with ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Hello all!
If I want to install Gazebo 1.9 on my laptop running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ROS Groovy, do I need to uninstall the ROS-included Gazebo? If yes, how?
Thank you all!

Could you go a bit more into detail how and what you've done? I'm pretty much in the same situation (aside from Kubunto 13.04)...

I have a short guide on how I did it, but for some reason I cant post answers (containing links..)
Sorry

I've decided to go with V-REP by Coppelia Robotics instead of Gazebo. Works as well and is, in my opinion, much more comfortable.

A:

I figured it out!!! Just dig around on the Gazebo Tutorials a bunch. There are some sections that actually give the command.
