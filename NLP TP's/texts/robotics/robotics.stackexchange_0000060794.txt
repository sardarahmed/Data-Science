Q:

respawn_delay does not delay the respawn!

There's a new .launch element (only in Indigo) that delays the repawn of a node. However, it doesn't do what it says.
This is a demo part of the .launch file I have: Is there anything I'm missing?
<node pkg="res_prj" type="init_tf_broadcaster" name="init_tf_br"
 respawn="true" respawn_delay="20"/>

I expect the node init_tf_br respawn after 20 secs, but it starts immediately once it dies.
Thanks in advance.

A:

It looks like that change was introduced three days ago, and hasn't been released yet: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/pull/446
Until the ros_comm maintainers do the next release, you should be able to test it if you get the latest version of ros_comm from source.
