Q:

Multple AppyWrenchDialog, storage data structure

Hi,
Can you please tell me what is happening when ApplyWrenchDialog is clicked for multiple links.
In which data structure is the name of all those links getting stored. (here by links I mean the links for which apply force/torque dialog is open)
Relevant source code :  gazebo/gui/ModelRightMenu.cc : https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/d3b06088be22a15a25025a952414bffb8ff6aa2b/gazebo/gui/ModelRightMenu.cc?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default

A:

All the link names get stored in gazebo::gui::ApplyWrenchDialog::linksComboBox. See the implementation for details.
