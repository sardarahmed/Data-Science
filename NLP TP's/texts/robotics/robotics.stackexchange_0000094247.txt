Q:

How to make a nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid manually?

Suppose I have a .png extension map in which the blocked paths are in black and free spots are white. Using OpenCV, how can I get an OccupancyGrid without using any external libraries?

A:

Occupancy Grids are probability maps, each grid shows the probability of an obstacle existing over there. So convert png into an array by reading the image using imread. And change the array values accordingly to match between 0 to 100.

Okay so, after making the changes to the array I'll just publish it as an OccupancyGrid right?

Yes, give it the details it's needs under nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid. Interesting taskphase eh?
