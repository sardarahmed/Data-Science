Q:

tf cannot find boost thread library

I am trying to build ros hydro from source on ubuntu 12.04 it requires boost 1.46.1 but the version of boost installed on my machine is 1.48 so I downloaded boost 1.46.1 and installed it in a local folder. I also added skip-keys flag in rosdep to stop it from installing boost (because it would remove the newer version). After installing these dependencies I did  ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release as mentioned here : http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source
this started building plain cmake and catkin packages but gave an error while building tf:
CMakeFiles/tf_monitor.dir/src/tf_monitor.cpp.o: In function main': tf_monitor.cpp:(.text.startup+0x3cf): undefined reference to boost::thread::start_thread_noexcept()'
tf_monitor.cpp:(.text.startup+0x46f): undefined reference to `boost::thread::join_noexcept()'
I specified the boost library path using CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH variable
cmake is able to find the local boost installation using this.
I also tried changing the CMakeCahe.txt file in tf package by specifying the location of libboost_thread.so but still no luck can someone please help .

A:

Finally solved it by changing the boost_include and boost_library path in CMakeCache.txt file so that they point to the local boost installation
