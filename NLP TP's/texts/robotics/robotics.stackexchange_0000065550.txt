I'm not aware of any robots with those features in that price range; sorry.

Especially the arm requirement will be tricky. Decent robot arms start around 25.000 €, I believe.

A:

In that price range getting a powerful robot is difficult, but you can have a look at the Corobot. Also check here. It comes in a price range of around 4500 USD. You will still have to get an arm for your robot or build one from scratch like the turtlebot_arm.
