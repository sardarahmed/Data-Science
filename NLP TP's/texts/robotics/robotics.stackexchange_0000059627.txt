How to turn on generating the debug info?

Debug symbols information is missing from my node built from cpp file with catkin_make in hydro. I need it to debug the node with the gdb. How to turn on generating the debug info?

A:

If you build the package from source you might want to set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to either Debug or RelWithDebInfo (see http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables) when invoking cmake:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
