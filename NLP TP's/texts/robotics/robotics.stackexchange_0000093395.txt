Q:

How to create a string message in a ROS package with catkin correctly?

This is the output of catkin_make that shows an error.

Update
Hey I got rid of thw following errors by reinstalling ROS melodic:
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roscpp" with any
of the following names:
        roscppConfig.cmake
        roscpp-config.cmake

However, I got more errors :(

We're going to need some more information here. Can you show us your code (source, CMakeLists.txt, etc.) in addition to this output?

Can you please update your question with the contents of the file instead of linking to it? That keeps the question self-contained (and useful to others in the future) if/when that link no longer works
Comment by Thomas D on 2019-09-24:
It would also help to know what you have in package.xml, since it appears that your package is not able to find roscpp package. It is in CMakeLists.txt. If it is not declared as a dependency in package.xml that could explain the error.
Comment by Thomas D on 2019-09-24:
When pasting code/files please remove the commented out boilerplate. Having a minimal working example makes it easier to see what is going on.
Comment by notSoTechnical on 2019-09-24:
I'm not sure why, but it says "This content is forbidden" whenever I paste something that is long in the comment.  package.xml: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k2Wnbu2nYjr06JW-gv-yCgFfDTBHOGTt/view?usp=sharing

@notSoTechnical That's because comments aren't for code, files, etc., they're for shorter exchanges. Codes, files, etc. should be put in questions as an update.

@jayess Thx!  I'm new
Comment by jayess on 2019-09-24:
No problem, welcome :)

A:

You have two options:

Add the following line to package.xml:

<depend>roscpp</depend>

According to your CMakeLists.txt you are not building a library or executable, only messages. Therefore, you could remove roscpp from your CMakeLists.txt file. You could also remove the include_directories() line from CMakeLists.txt for now.

If you were to add code into the repo_name_hw2 package, you would need to go with Option 1. If you are only going to have messages/services/actions defined in the repo_name_hw2 package you would probably want to go with Option 2.

Hey Tom!  Thanks!  I deleted roscpp and it seemed working... until I can't display the message.  Any idea? https://answers.ros.org/question/333876/how-to-display-the-ros-message-in-the-terminal/
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-25:
@notSoTechnical: the enthusiasm is appreciated, but could you please follow up on your open questions first? Right now you have a flurry of questions open, with no clear resolution, and you jumping to different subjects in the comments beneath the potential answers.
I'd recommend to be a little more methodical in troubleshooting and when interacting with forum members here.
Comment by notSoTechnical on 2019-09-25:
@gvdhoorn   Sorry, I'm new.  I will be more methodical in the future
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-25:
No need to apologise. Just keep it in mind.
