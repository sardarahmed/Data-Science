Q:

wiimote installation

Hi everybody
I read on the ros.org wiki site (http://ros.org/wiki/wiimote#The_State_Message) about the wiimote, but on item number 4 which states "Check out the wiimote package, and rosmake to ready the package for operation. Plug the Bluetooth dongle into your machine's USB port.", what does it mean "Check out the wiimote package"?

A:

I guess the wiki site is sort of outdated. I would not suggest to build the package from source since there are debian packages available. To install the stack joystick_drivers in fuerte, enter the following in a terminal:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-joystick-drivers
