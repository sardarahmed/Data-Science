Q:

roslaunch: suppress summary

I'm doing a project where I'm using roslaunch to run our software stack through several regression tests and each time I call roslaunch it prints out a summary with all the parameters loaded (there are dozens). This summary is getting in the way of parsing useful printouts from our nodes. Is there a way to stop roslaunch from printing out this summary or otherwise suppress the output while leaving node output intact?
started roslaunch server <>

SUMMARY
========

PARAMETERS  
 * /rosdistro: noetic  
 * /rosversion: 1.15.14

I've updated the title of your question, as the original title made it seem it was a duplicate of the many other Q&As which ask for "suppressing summary output" (such as #q349820).

A:

Is there a way to stop roslaunch from printing out this summary or otherwise suppress the output while leaving node output intact?

No.
--no-summary will suppress everything from the summary.

Edit:

when I said node output I meant the printouts from the nodes themselves (with output=screen), not the list of nodes launched in the summary.

Ah.
In that case: --no-summary should do what you want.

This was exactly what I was looking for, thanks a lot!

I'm confused. --no-summary suppresses the summary completely, including the Nodes section.

Sorry, when I said node output I meant the printouts from the nodes themselves (with output=screen), not the list of nodes launched in the summary.

Then technically, your question is a duplicate of #q349820.
But seeing as the title is different, I've not closed it as such.
