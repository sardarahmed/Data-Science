Q:

Difference between rosrun and directly launching an executable

What are the differences between :
rosrun mynode program

And :
cd /path/to/mynode
./program

Why is the first (I assume) preferred, and when is it required ?

A:

In principle it should do the same.
The difference is that you don't need to know the actual path to program in the package.
Also rosrun will run the node of package mynode, not the node in /path/to/mynode. Usually that is the same, but if you switched you workspace or something like that you might run something of another setup than you think you are.
