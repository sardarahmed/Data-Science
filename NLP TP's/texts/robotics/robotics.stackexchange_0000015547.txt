Q:

RViz: How to Visualize a Voxblox Mesh as a MarkerArray?

I am currently trying to run the test cow and lady dataset with Voxblox.  The process appears to execute properly in the terminal, but I cannot view the mesh in RViz.
When I try to add the topic voxblox_node/mesh to RViz, the topic name is greyed out and I cannot add the topic.  This topic is listed under "unvisualizable topics".

In Rviz, I tried creating a topic of type MarkerArray and manually typing in the topic name to add it.  This does not work and I get the following error:

The Voxblox documentation states that the node voxblox_node publishes:

mesh of type visualization_msgs::MarkerArray. A visualization topic showing the mesh produced from the tsdf in a form that can be seen in RViz.

Why doesn't Rviz recognize mesh as a MarkerArray? What do I need to do to get Rviz to visualize /voxblox_node/mesh?
Thanks.

A:

So the doc's were out of date. I just updated them as the mesh is actually of type voxblox_msgs::MeshBlock. Voxblox use to output a standard MarkerArray, however this form of visualization means you have to output the entire mesh every time any part of it changes. This meant when running on a robot and visualizing on a laptop we were saturating our wifi connection to display even relatively small areas.
To correct this issue we made a custom message that supports partial updates only changing the mesh where needed. To use this custom message you have to build voxblox_rviz_plugin and have it in your workspace when running rviz.
