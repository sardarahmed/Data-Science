Q:

How can I use just the local planner?

Hi,
is it possible to just use the local planner?
My goal is just to detect obstacles in front of the robot and do some exploration.
Tried it in my own move_base class like that
costmap_2d::Costmap2DROS costmap("my_costmap", tf);

I also made config files for local and global costmap, and turned static_map to false.
But my code always says waiting for map ...
Edit:
Now I also use gmapping to produce a map:
rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan

So my code runs and I only get a warning:

You have set map parameters, but also requested to use the static map. Your parameters will be overwritten by those given by the map server

I now also have a message "nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid".
So am I right that I can use this message  and look for obstacles in the grid?
Or is there a better solution?
To just use the navigation stack is not an option for me ;)

A:

If you just want to avoid using the global planner, there's a simple hack: use goal_passer in the navigation_experimental stack as your global planner. The goal_passer does (next to) nothing and just sends the goal to your local planner as it is.
