Q:

Is there a pre-built Graspit package for Fuerte?

I tried to install the graspit simulator using the approach here
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-graspit-simulator  (replacing "diamondback" with "fuerte")
But the install failed with "Unable to locate package".
Most of the graspit_simulator  wiki links are busted.
Does this package exist under Fuerte?  Has it moved?

A:

The graspit_simulator stack is not currently released under Fuerte.
The plan is to complete the release and update the documentation in early November 2012.
Note that you can still check it out from source code and compile manually under Fuerte:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-object-manipulation
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/graspit_simulator/trunk graspit_simulator
You might need to apt-get by hand the system dependencies in graspit_simulator/rosdep.yaml (Qt, Coin, etc.)
