Q:

how to use "MovableText"?

I found this class on api documentaion(http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/api/1.2.5/classgazebo_1_1rendering_1_1MovableText.html)
Its description said "description: This create create a billboarding object that display a text."
(https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/e8f7b58b28a8fc88dfd3480c7a6ea76e7c7032a9/gazebo/rendering/MovableText.cc?at=gazebo-current-prerelease_2.2.0)
So , I imaged that my gazebo window would be like this (http://imgur.com/inihTnQ).
Because this class is under the namespace"rendering",
I thought "MovableText" should be used in system plugin
Then, i built a system plugin like this (http://pastebin.com/mTtTVR8s)
But ,nothing happened!
could you tell me how to use this class correctly,thank you~

Looking into the API, maybe you should call the Load function as well at first.
