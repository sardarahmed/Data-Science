Q:

Setting up ROS, where to put environment variable?

Hi,
Where should I place the following in Ubuntu 12.04?
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/catkin_ws:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
I want to launch this everytime so that I can just use
roscd beginner_tutorials
everytime.
Thanks.

A:

You can put that kind of export in your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc if you use zsh). Thus it will be automatically exported when you open a shell.
Check this page for more information, as your problem is similar to having to run source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash for each new shell.
In your ~/.bashrc, you will probably end up having something like this (if you use hydro):
# ROS
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.zsh
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/catkin_ws:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
