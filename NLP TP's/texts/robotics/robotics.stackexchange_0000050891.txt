Q:

Why do the features of pcl_ros decrease

Hi.
Now we have a mind to rearrange our pcl ros wrappers, jsk_pcl_ros(http: //sourceforge.net/p/jsk-ros-pkg/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/jsk_pcl_ros/),
and to send our features to the upstream,https:// github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/fuerte-devel/pcl_ros.
But when I see the code of pcl_ros, I feel that the features of the codes are decreasing as the branches of pcl_ros are updated.
For example, perception_pcl/pcl_ros/src/{segmentation,surface} are lost.
We are also lost about that.
If we send a pull request to bring back the lost features, does ros-perception accept it?
And if we send our features to them, does they accept it?
What is the policy of maintenance of pcl_ros?
Sorry for my strange English.
Thanks.

A:

I can't speak for the pcl_ros maintainers, but I expect they would accept a well-implemented push request to reinstate missing features.
To make it easy to merge your changes:

open an issue explaining what is being added
fork the ros-perception/perception_pcl repository on github
make your changes
test them
submit a pull request, referring to the relevant issue number

I appreciate your detailed answer.
But I want to know whether ros-perception really have a will to merge our pull request if it is good.
I want to avoid needless bother.
Thanks.

Go ahead and open the issue. Explain that you will provide a fix if they are willing to review it and merge if appropriate. You can provide a link to this question.
