Q:

Autonomous Localization using AMCL

Hi,
I am trying to get my turtlebot to localize itself automatically instead of me using the 2D Pose Estimate. Is there any way I can make that possible? I am using an RPLidar A2 sensor only.

A:

You can try the calling rosservice call /global_localization
It will spread AMCL particles all around your map, so once you start moving, or calling rosservice call /no_motion_update as mentioned by @achimk, it may converge to your actual position.
