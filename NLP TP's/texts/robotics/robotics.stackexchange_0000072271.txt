A:

If I have understood well, you would like to load a map on Rviz. To load a map on Rviz you have two options:

via a launch file

do it manually. Open a terminal and go to the directory where you have put your map file and run:

rosrun map_server map_server
sample.yaml

After you run rviz, (e.g., rosrun rviz rviz),
add Map from the bottom left tab. Then, under the topic section choose /map.
