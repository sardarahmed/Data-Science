Q:

Implementing C++ code into ROS using roscpp

If I write a program in C++, is there a way for ROS to recognize it and run the code through roscpp? I am writing a C++ program to recognize a sensor (connected via USB), read in the data, track the data, etc. Will roscpp allow me to run that C++ program through ROS? (I will be using diamondback and the TurtleBot).

You should have a look at the tutorials for roscpp. They will show you how to do what you're trying to do.
