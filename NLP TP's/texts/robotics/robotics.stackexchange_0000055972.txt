Q:

Depth map from bumblebee2 camera?

Hi,
I am trying to get the coordinates in space (X,Y,Z) of an object. For this, I am detecting the object using the image from the bumblebee's left camera (from here I can obtain the X and Y coordinates), and would like to obtain the Z-coordinate. I have the code for doing this with an Asus Xtion, but this uses a depth map. Can I get a depth map as well from my bumblebee2 camera? Or should I just use the disparity image I get from stereo_image_proc?
Thanks!

You probably want to use the points2 data type

Did you solve the problem? As i kown, There exist a package called"stereo_image_proc" which publish the disparity, and the "stereo_image_proc" package have a file "point_cloud2.cpp" you can get the depth of z in it(or need some transform).

A:

have you manage to solve it?
I am in the same situation... would like to get the depth image but stereo_image_proc is only giving the disparity one. The transformation is easy (Z=T*f/d) , but I suppose there must be any node that implement this, and gives values or interpolate the value of the disparity nan, 0 and inf pixels....
