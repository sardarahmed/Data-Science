Q:

Multiple Camera Nodes

I'm trying to use two basler cameras in a stereo configuration, utilizing the pylon_camera module to grab frames. My cameras use the USB3.0 interface. I'm struggling to connect to both camera's simultaneously because they have identical DeviceUserID's (daA1280-54uc). How can I change the DeviceUserID's of the cameras such that they will have unique values?
Unfortunately since they don't use the GigE interface, I don't believe that I can use IPConfigurator to accomplish this.

A:

Have you tried to run

rosrun pylon_camera write_device_user_id_to_camera cam_1

when only a single camera is attached to your computer to write the device_user_id?

That's what I needed. I wish this that this was made more clear in the documentation.
