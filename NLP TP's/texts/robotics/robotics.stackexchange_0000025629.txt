Q:

hg clone = HTTP Error 400: Bad Request

$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo gazebo

requesting all changes abort: HTTP 
Error 400: Bad Request

Edit:  but these two commands are okay: 
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo-release
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models

And I can download the fuerte or john release ZIP file from the downloads page.
BitBucket has had some weird errors like this before...  can someone try the commands please?

A:

Either bitbucket was down, or your network connection was. That command works for me.

It could be a strange network error in our area, but it only seems to be on the gazebo repo.

I'm able to clone gazebo without a problem, and so are our continuous integration machines, which clone it many times per day to run tests.  The problem might be at bitbucket's end, but without being able to reproduce it ourselves, I'm not sure how to help.

Okay, I checked from home, same error. Perhaps you guys can ask BitBucket to fix the repo?  a quick Google search shows that error has appeared on other people's repo's. But, I guess most people compiling from source know how to get around this...

I've posted an issue at Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/6015/user-unable-to-clone-osrf-gazebo.  I'll comment back here if/when I hear something on it.

Can you clone another repo, such as https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim?
