Q:

help with SLAM, robotic platform and orientation

Hi, I'm new in this and I have to choose a robotic platform. I'm gonna work in a robotic platform with a kinect (from the xbox 360) using ROS packages to do SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). More than anything I need orientation about how to proceed in this subject. My goal is through a 2WD mobile robot do SLAM in a room for instance. I know that are some useful packages in ROS like gmapping and rviz, but I'm lost in the procedure.
Thanks in advance

A:

How about starting with a Turtlebot?
You can even [simulate it in Gazebo](Gazebo Bringup Guide) and follow the navigation tutorials
