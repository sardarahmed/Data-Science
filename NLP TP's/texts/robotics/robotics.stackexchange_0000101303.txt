Q:

How to use the recursive function in ros2

Hi all,
I have a while loop that gets triggered when a msg is received on a topic. So while it's looping in while loop my node is not receiving any msg from any other topics. so that my looping can work updated data.
FYI when I mean a while loop I am using recursive function.
Let me know if you want any sample code or demo code for it.
Thanks for your help,

A:

I used the threading function in python to solve the problem with the recursive function not sure if there was any better way to do that.
