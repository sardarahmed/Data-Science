Q:

No executable file is generated after catkin_make

I was trying to use c++ to publish a Twist message. I added a couple of sentences introduced in wiki tutorials.
include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(test src/test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(test ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(test beginner_tutorials_generate_message_cpp)

But after running catkin_make, there was no executable file generated. I do not know how to solve this problem.
I am using ROS Indigo running on Ubuntu 14.04.

catkin_ws is not a command. Did you do a catkin_make? Please follow the tutorials closely and try to understand what is done where...

So sorry. I meant to write catkin_make not catkin_ws.
Comment by mgruhler on 2016-02-12:
the executable file should be in the devel folder, did you check there? Any errors in catkin_make?
Comment by percy_liu on 2016-02-12:
I checked devel folder and didn't find the executable file. When I run catkin_make, no error reported. There should be a message like "Build Target test". Actually, there was not.

Do you see the +++ processing catkin package: and ==> add_subdirectory outputs when you do catkin_make? Try a clean build (i.e. remove build and devel folder first). Does roscd <YOURPACKAGE>  work?

Please add any commands that you run and their outputs.

A:

You might need to add catkin_package() underneath those lines in your CMakeLists.txt. Check http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt.
