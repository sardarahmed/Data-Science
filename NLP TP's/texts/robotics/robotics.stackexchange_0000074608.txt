Q:

why the tf.transformPoint is giving tf exception?

I am trying to transform a point from a base_link frame to camera frame. When run the below code getting error message "Exception: Lookup would require extrapolation into the future. canTransform returned after 4.003 timeout was 4.Requested time 1466110388.818536997 but the latest data is at time 3101.240000000, when looking up transform from frame [base_link] to frame [wide_stereo_optical_frame].
target = "wide_stereo_optical_frame"; 
point = PointStamped()
point.point.x =2;
point.point.y = 1;
point.point.z = 1;
point.header.frame_id = "base_link";
point.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now(); 
tl_ = tf.TransformListener();
tl_.waitForTransform(target, point.header.frame_id, rospy.Time.now(), rospy.Duration(5.0));
camera_target = tf.transformPoint(target, point)
botf base_link and wide_stereo_optical_frame  frames are available in tf database. I verified the in the terminal like this 
rosrun tf tf_echo /base_link /wide_stereo_optical_frame

Is this still a problem after you resolved: http://answers.ros.org/question/237248/why-rospy-time-always-prining-zero/

A:

The problem is solved after referring to this link.
The workaround is, I used a sleep function after tfObject creation.
tl_ = tf.TransformListener();
rospy.sleep(10.)                        # The above sleep function gives the sufficient time to load frames from /tf topic

Did you have to wait 10 second to catch your tf transform?
That is weird in most of the applications, but ok..

I tried running my node in a faster computer. It's working fine now without sleep()

I'm having the exact same problem, but this did not work :/
