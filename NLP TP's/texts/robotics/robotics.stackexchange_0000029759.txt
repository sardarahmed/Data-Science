Q:

Openni compilation error

I'm getting a compilation error when building openni on Ubuntu 10.10:
In file included from openni_camera/src/openni_driver.cpp:43:
openni_camera/include/openni_camera/openni.h:45: fatal error: Eigen/Core: No such file or directory
I'm using the version checked out from git https://github.com/ros-pkg-git/ni.git with an svn installation of ROS.  Presumably there's some library that I'm missing.

A:

The solution I found was to install the diamondback version of ROS.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/
Only then could I get openni to compile as per the instructions.
