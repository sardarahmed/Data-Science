Q:

How do you install tf_transformations?

I've recently been following the ROS 2 Galactic tutorials and I've reached "Introduction to tf2". I wasn't able to install the demos with sudo apt-get install ros-galactic-turtle-tf2-py for some reason, so I tried building from source. But I can't seem to install a package I appear to be missing.
Here's how I set up the workspace:
$ mkdir -p min_ws/src
$ cd min_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ros/geometry_tutorials.git -b ros2
Cloning into 'geometry_tutorials'...

$ cd ..
$ rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro galactic -y
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
turtle_tf2_py: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [tf_transformations]

I have tried searching for where this package to see how to install it but nothing came up. I have also tried
sudo apt install tf_transformations
sudo apt install python-transforms3d-pip
sudo apt install transforms3d

(I have done pip3 install transforms3d already)
I tried to move on but as we expect, the node runs into
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tf_transformations'

Here's a snippet from ros2 doctor --report

EDIT: Added info on how I set up the workspace, and how I called rosdep.
In response to @tfoote's comment:

I'm not sure how, but I guess there's something wrong with my installation. Here is what I did before:

sudo apt install ros-galactic-desktop
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

Adding to .bashrc:
$ cat ~/.bashrc | tail -n 10
## ROS sourcing
# ROS 2 core - underlay
source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
# colcon_cd
source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh
# Where ROS stack is
export _colcon_cd_root=~/ros2_install
# Choose ROS_DOMAIN_ID
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0

Seems like I have some tf2 stuff, but not ros-galactic-tf-conversions:
$ sudo apt list --installed | grep "ros-galactic-tf"

WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.

A:

This is a ROS package. https://index.ros.org/p/tf_transformations
If you want the tf_transformations package from apt for galactic you should install ros-galactic-tf-transformations If rosdep is giving you that error it doesn't know that you want galactic. You should either source your galactic workspace setup file to get ROS_DISTRO set or manually set it to galactic it so rosdep knows you want galactic.

For easier help in the future, please show your full command that you're running not just the error message. And also explain how to setup your workspace. I had to make a lot of informed guesses to provide this answer.

Thanks for your time and your contributions to ROS. I couldn't get very far with your suggestions, but I have added the missing information to the question and added more information below the line to make my situation clearer.

Sorry I typoed when I typed the package name. It should be ros-galactic-tf-transformations
