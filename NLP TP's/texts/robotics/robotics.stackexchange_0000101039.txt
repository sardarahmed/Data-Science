Q:

how can I load neural network with ros-melodic?

Hi I'm trying to combine UR5 robot with neural network.
I trained SAC with python3 and I hoped to load action obtained from SAC to apply it on ROS using python 2.
Is there any way to enable it?
Before this, I tried to load it using python.subprocess command, but it requires the conda virtual environment to implement python3 code, so I failed with it.
Thank you for reading.

Hi @Hwang
Working with Python 3 in Melodic is not very easy. If possible switch to ROS Noetic and you will have a smoother experience.
Refer to prior answer for a more complete explanation: #q348093

I would suggest the OP to take a look at either wiki/catkin_virtualenv or rospypi/simple. Both make using Python 3 with Melodic quite doable.
