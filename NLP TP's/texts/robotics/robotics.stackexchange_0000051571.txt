Q:

How to install Groovy on Ubuntu 13.04

I want to test Morse simulator recently. Since Morse only support Ubuntu 13.04 or later, I wonder if there is any approach to install Groovy on Ubuntu 13.04? Thanks

A:

A cleaner option is probably building what you need from source.
That will be more work for you, but is more likely to produce a reliable result than installing binaries that were built for a different Ubuntu version.
