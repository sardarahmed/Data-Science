Q:

catkin build question

If I have two catkin work directories and one is dependent on the other for a package. How do I tell the build to look there. Does it use ROS environment variable for a list of source directories? I did put source setup for both in my bashrc file. But the referring directory still does not find the package in the other ws.

A:

Sourcing both setup.bash files doesn't make both workspaces "active" -- as soon as you source the second, it negates the fact that you had sourced the first at all. Rather, you should be only sourcing the setup.bash file for the workspace that is an "overlay" on the first workspace. See this answer for more explanation.
This is one of the reasons I really like catkin-tools; it features convenient commands for explicit workspace chaining.
