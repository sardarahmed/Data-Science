Q:

reading header of message phython

hi bellow is a link to the topic I am subscribing to

sensor_msgs/LaserScan

header header  # timestamp in the header is the acquisition time of the first ray in the scan.
compact message definition (partial)
std_msgs/Header header
float32 angle_min
float32 angle_max

How do you access the time_stamp in the header?
I know how to access other elements
def callback_lidar(data):
eg i would do angle = data.angle_min
ect
ps for some reason when i write questions/paste code all the spacing gets ignored...

would it be time_scan = data.stg_msg.time

Use the code button (10101010) to display code nicely.

Also, you can select a chunk of verbatim lines and press C-k to indent them all four spaces so they display correctly.

A:

Assuming your message is in msg, the time stamp is: msg.header.stamp.
