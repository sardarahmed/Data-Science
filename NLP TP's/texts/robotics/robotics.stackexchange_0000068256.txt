Q:

Advertising multiple services from a single node

Hi,
I'm writing a node, that advertises multiple services.
Should I use a diffrent object name for each service, or the same name (see below)?
As I understand it, this results in either multiple instances of a ros::ServiceServer Object, or a single one in the latter case..
Ex. 1:

ros::ServiceServer service1 = nodeHandle.advertiseService("serviceOne", serviceOneFunction);
ros::ServiceServer service2 = nodeHandle.advertiseService("serviceTwo", serviceTwoFunction);

Ex. 2:

ros::ServiceServer service = nodeHandle.advertiseService("serviceOne", serviceOneFunction);
ros::ServiceServer service = nodeHandle.advertiseService("serviceTwo", serviceTwoFunction);

Which Option should I choose? Is there anything else to remember, while writing nodes, that advertise multiple services?
Thanks

A:

The first one. The second one doesn't even compile.

Do you have any experience regarding performance, when a node advertises many services?

It's not a function call obviously, but especially if you use a persistent connection in the client it's OK for speed.
