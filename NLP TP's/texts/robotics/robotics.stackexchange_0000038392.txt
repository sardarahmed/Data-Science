Q:

problem with roscreate-pkg

hi!
I have a problem in a terminal when I trying create a new package within the folder nxt.  The message I get is:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/bin/roscreate-pkg", line 35, in 
roscreate.roscreatepkg.roscreatepkg_main()
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/tools/roscreate/src/roscreate/roscreatepkg.py", line 126, in roscreatepkg_main
create_package(package, author_name(), depends, uses_roscpp=uses_roscpp, uses_rospy=uses_rospy)
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/tools/roscreate/src/roscreate/roscreatepkg.py", line 63, in create_package
os.makedirs(p)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py", line 157, in makedirs
mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/opt/ros/electric/stacks/nxt/learning_nxt'
how I can solve?

thanks,
I was just following the tutorial nxt, and as there are working on nxt folder, because I believed they were working with that of ros, but I see that I have to create one with the same name in my workspace, I'm right?

That should work.  For clarity I might suggest that you not use things with the same name.

A:

It is not recommended to work in /opt.  Those packages are installed on your system and shared with all users, and the directories are read only except as root.  If you follow the first few ROS Tutorials they will guide you through creating a package in an area where you can write.
