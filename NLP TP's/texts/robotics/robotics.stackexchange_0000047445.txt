Q:

Boost Library Link Failure

Linking CXX executable ../bin/decision_ensemble
  /usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/decision_ensemble.dir/src/decision_ensemble.o: undefined reference to symbol 'boost::signals::connection::~connection()'
  /usr/bin/ld: note: 'boost::signals::connection::~connection()' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libboost_signals.so.1.46.1 so try adding it to the linker command line
  /usr/lib/libboost_signals.so.1.46.1: could not read symbols: Invalid operation
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Anyone have this issue before?
My CMakeLists.txt has: rosbuild_add_boost_directories() added.
Call using boost bind:
sync.registerCallback(boost::bind(&DecisionEnsemble::ensembleCallback, &ensemble, _1, _2, _3));

I am trying to synch 3 messages containing a header with timestamp, a string and an int32.
Using the approximate example in the tutorials and various blogs out there have not helped.
Can anyone share there successful use of approximate time and CMakeLists.txt as an example to point me in the correct direction?

Comment by joq on 2013-01-19:
Which boost directories did you add using rosbuild_add_boost_directories()?

A:

Simply add:
rosbuild_link_boost(target lib1 lib2 lib3 ...)

to your CMakeList.txt, in your case:
rosbuild_link_boost( yourExecutableName signals )
