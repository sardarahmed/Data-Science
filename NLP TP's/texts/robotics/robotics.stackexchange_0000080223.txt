Q:

frames not shown using view_frame node but in RViz

Hi,
I am simulating mobile robot in Gazebo and visulizing in RViz. I have attached camera and laser links and corresponding Gazebo plugins and can successfully see them in RViz and Gazebo. I can see all the frames in TF tree in RVIz including laser link and camera link. However whenever I use rosrun tf view_frames to see the transform tree I noticed that laser and camera links are missing from there. The URDF clearly describes the parent and child links for laser and camera joints. Further to inform that robot_sate_publisher and joint_sate_publisher nodes are also running. Then my question is why can not I see laser joint and camera joint in frames.pdf generated using  rosrun tf view_frames but in RViz those joint transform are shown OK with correct transforms?
Thank you in advance.

A:

Can you try rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py http://wiki.ros.org/tf2_tools instead?

Thank you. Now I can see all the links with their associated parent and child links. However I was wondering why Average rate : 10000.0, Buffer length: 0.0, Most resent transform: 0.0, Oldest transform: 0.0 for camera and laser joints but non zero entries for the same for four wheel joints?

Those are static transforms. They don't have a buffer length and are infinitely resolvable. The 10000.0 is just filled in to show a very high number. It can be considered infinity.
