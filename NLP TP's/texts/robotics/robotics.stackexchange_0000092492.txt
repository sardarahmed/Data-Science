Q:

Dynamically Reconfigure AMCL Params

How is it possible to dynamically reconfigure AMCL params with the dynamic_reconfigure package? AMCL does not have a set_params service so the reconfigure node always times out waiting for it to be advertised and accomplishes nothing.
I hope this is a simple question to answer, thanks so much!

rqt_reconfigure  succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI.
Here is how to reconfigure AMCL using rqt_reconfigure's graphical user interface:
Start AMCL and pass the laser scans topic and robot base_frame_id as parameters.
In my case it is:
$ rosrun amcl amcl scan:=/kobuki/laser/scan base_frame_id:=/base_footprint

Or create an amcl launch file and use that launch file to start the amcl node.
Then launch rqt_reconfigure:
$ rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

You will see the screen as follows:

Click on amcl on the left side panel.
To modify the parameters on the fly, click and drag any of the sliders.
