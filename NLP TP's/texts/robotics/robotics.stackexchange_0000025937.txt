Q:

using rosbag record for recording/joint_states

Hi
I am trying to record just the effort of part of the joints, what is the right way to do it?
Thanks
this is what i tried but didn't work:
rosbag record -O 3_cm /joint_states/effort/[15]

Nachum
edit:
I did rosbag record -O 3_cm /joint_states it does make a bag file but it doesn't let me display it in plot mode, only in raw data mode. Can it be changed?

if i do that i get  [ INFO] [1362313142.091380085]: Subscribing to /joint_states/effort/[15]
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'ros::InvalidNameException'
what():  Character [[] at element [21] is not valid in Graph Resource Name [/joint_states/effort/[15]].  Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, / and _.

A:

Does the following do what you want?
rosbag record /atlas/joint_states

Given that all the data goes into one message, I don't think you can record just the effort. The rest of the fields (with the exception of the names) will probably be empty, so essentially you will be recording just the efforts if that is what is being published.

I'm able to record it but not in a format that can be plotted with rxbag. i get it as raw numbers
