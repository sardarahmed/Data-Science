Q:

Slam gmapping problems

Hello all,
Trying to do some mapping with a corobot Explorer robot. I have here the terminal output:
hmt@hmt-snowball:~/roscorobot-code/Corobot/corobot_teleop$ rostopic list

So, as can be clearly deciphered, I recorded a bag file with the /tf and /scan topics. So, how do I use the gmapping utility to generate a map by playing the bag file?
Thanks,
-Hunter A.

A:

Sorry guys, the issue was not any gmapping (Shocking, right?). It was the robot. The driver is messed up beyond my ability to repair. So, the company is fixing it.
Thanks anyway for your quick responses,
-Hunter A.
