Q:

I had installed the ros hydro for use in a JACO, but when i try to use roslaunch, says roslaunch was not found. I search in the directory /opt/ros/hydro/share   and there isn't the folder roslaunch

Check in /opt/ros/hydro/bin for a roslaunch executable. Also, have you sourced the setup file for Hydro - "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" ?

A:

If the folder /opt/ros/hydro/share does not exists you haven't installed the Debian package ros-hydro-roslaunch.
Try installing it with sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-roslaunch.
How did you install ROS Hydro in the first place? It seems like you didn't follow the tutorials. May be you want to do that to make sure to have all base ROS packages and not lacking other packages too.
