Q:

ROS Driver for Keyence SZ-16D safety Sensor

Hello Everyone,
I am working on a Keyence 2D Lidar  SZ-16D. The LIDAR communicates with the computer through RS-422A interface. I was wondering if someone has already written the ROS driver for it.
If not I would like to write one, it would be really great if someone with a experience of ROS driver development(for lidars)experience could show me the direction. Thank you

Hi, can you confirm us what you do with Keyence 2D Lidar SZ-16D driver? are you test it using velodyne driver? thanks for your contribution :)

A:

Another example of a nice (at least, I've always thought so) example of a driver for Lidars is the velodyne package by @joq.
