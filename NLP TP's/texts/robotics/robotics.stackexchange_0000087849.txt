Q:

Time travel with tf - tutorial - confusing target and source frames

Regarding the time travel with tf tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Time%20travel%20with%20tf%20%28Python%29
It is stated:

Give the transform from this frame, at this time ... to this frame, at this time. Specify the frame that does not change over time, in this case the "/world" frame, and the variable to store the result in.

But I find that confusing, since I thought it was:

Give the transform TO this frame, at this time ... FROM this frame, at this time. Specify the frame that does not change over time, in this case the "/world" frame, and the variable to store the result in.

Did I miss something or is the order of TO/FROM wrong/misleading?
From what I can see from the documentation you pass the target first, then the source.

A:

You are right that it's a little confusing.
The transform from Frame A to Frame B is the transform which when applied to an object in frame B will represent it in frame A.
