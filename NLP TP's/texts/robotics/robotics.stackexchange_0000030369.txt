Q:

Behavior of JointTrajectoryActionController with a single goal

If I send the JointTrajectoryActionController a single goal using the SimpleActionClient with a velocity and acceleration of 0 each, will the commanded motor torques simply be like a PID controller with a fixed set point?
Will the r_arm_controller (which I am assuming is a JointTrajectoryActionController) start behaving like a JointPositionController in this case?
Thanks.

A:

The desired position trajectory will be a fifth-order polynomial, with start and end boundary conditions of 0 velocities and accelerations. Also called a "minimum jerk" movement in some communities.
If you omit accelerations, you'll get a cubic spline. If you also omit velocities, you get linear interpolation. This is some documentation I found about this: http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_mechanism_controllers/JointSplineTrajectoryController
