Q:

PR2 Dashboard Icons Source

Does anyone have the source image files for the PR2 Dashboard Icons?

Specifically, I'm looking for the blank images without any icons on them.

A:

I uploaded the PSD template here:
https://code.ros.org/svn/data/trunk/pr2_dashboard/glassbutton2.psd
You'll have to sort through the layer combos if you want to export the blank images.

I don't have a copy of photoshop ATM, but opening it in GIMP gives me largely black and white layers. Otherwise, this is exactly what I was looking for.

I have confirmed it is GIMP's fault.
