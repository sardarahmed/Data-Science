Q:

Hi,

I just updated the ros-fuerte- realted things from ubuntu software center and the packages which were working and compiling before are showing this error.
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

  Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
  broken dependency!

Any help ?

A:

That was caused by this bug in PCL. The next update should solve this issue; in the meanwhile, just do this:
sudo rm -r /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/perception_pcl/pcl
