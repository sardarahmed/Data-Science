Q:

What ever happened to the velo 2g gripper?

Back in 2013 Willow Garage designed and potentially distributed a fantastic gripper called the velo 2g. From the video
it looks like it was perfect for gripping household objects.
I am looking for a gripper for the Baxter robot and I have yet to find anything as slim and versatile as the velo 2g appears. Does anyone know if this gripper (or just its design) is available? What happened to it?

Sorry in advance for this question being a little off topic. I didn't know where else to ask it.

I do not believe the Velo 2G gripper is available from any source right now.
