Q:

Hokuyo_node Dynamically Reconfigure max_range min_range

Dear all.
I just wondering whether it might be possible to dynamically reconfigure the parameters "max_range" and "min_range" of the hokuyo_node.
As far as I can see in the documentation  http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node
the previous parameters are just read only.
I would like to filter the "min_range" for instance to 0.20, so the laser can filter all readings less than 0.20.
In advance thank you

A:

This feature is a bad idea for a driver.  Filtering based on range does not save bandwidth or processing, so there's no real advantage here.  In fact, there's a real disadvantage if you're logging the data and decide later that you really needed all readings less than 0.15m instead.
It's best to create a node that reads the laser scan, changes it, and republishes it on a different topic.  You can then log /scan and generate new configurations of /scan_range_filtered when you play back bagfiles.
/scan -> /scan_range_filtered
Don't forget to use REP 117 if you change the range values.  http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0117.html

First at all, thank you for your replay. I can see that the hokuyo_node has a parameter called 'use_rep_117' it is set true by default, so I guess is to change this value to false with the following command,   'rosparam set use_rep_117 true', right? what do you mean with log /scan?
