Q:

can't access ROS svn

Hi,
I'm trying to svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/trunk, but it's not accepting my username and password. I registered almost a week ago. I know it says there's a small delay between registration and being able to access the repository, but what it seems like it should be going through at this point.
Please help, I'm really stuck without being able to build OpenCV as armv6,armv7,universal

A:

Your url doesn't point to an existing project.  OpenCV is hosted at a different url: http://code.opencv.org/svn/opencv/trunk according to the OpenCV wiki: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide
