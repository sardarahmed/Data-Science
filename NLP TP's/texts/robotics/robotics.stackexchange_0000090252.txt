Q:

Dynamixel X with OpenCM 9.04C and ROS possible or OpenCR/U2D2 need?

Dear all,
I plan to build a robot arm with Dynamixel X servos. I also want to use ROS tools and drivers for the servos. I found there is a cheap OpenCM 9.04C Controller board (~20USD) available, also the U2D2 USB Interface (~50USD) and then the OpenCR Board (~200USD). In the ROS packages I only found the OpenCR mentioned. My plan is that ROS runs on the PC and I just need the interface from there to Dynamixel X. My question is: Can I control the Dynamixel X (T version with 3 cables) on ROS through the OpenCM 9.04 board? And can you name me the ROS packages I need for this? Or do I need to buy one of the 2 other boards (U2D2 or OpenCR)?
Thank you for any help, I'm new to Dynamixel ;-)

Thank you for your inquiry about Dynamixels.
To control Dynamixels on your PC, you are supposed to need U2D2 (http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/interface/u2d2/) and U2D2 power hub (http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/interface/u2d2_power_hub/)
The releated packages are showing
DynamixelSDK and Dynamixel-Workbench

Hi, good to see this post. I have the similar situation. I have RPi3+openCM904 and i am willing to use ROS with this configuration. Can I go with configuring ROS on "RPi3+openCM9.04+Dynamixel"? If YES, please help me to setup the supported library and development. Please guide me accordingly~ Thanks! Best Regards, /Ash
