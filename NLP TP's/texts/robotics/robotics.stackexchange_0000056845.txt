Q:

Controlling rviz via rosservice

I would like to use rviz as a viewer for an external path planning application. In the application, controlled by python, I have robots and obstacles. Robots are downloaded via urdf files by python commands. In my current understanding of rviz, to visualize a robot, I need to click on the "Add" button to add a robot. Is it possible to add a robot only by python commands via a ros service for instance ?

rosservice call rviz add_robot ${robot_name}_description

Same question for collada or vrml meshes.

A:

rviz uses the system robot_description parameter. If you want to visualize another robot for a path planning application I recommend looking at the MoveIt rviz plugins as examples.
