Q:

Why doesn't rviz appear as a node in rqt_graph?

Why doesn't rviz appear as a node in rqt_graph? rviz is subscribed to some topics (such as /scan), but I don't see it in rqt_graph.

A:

Hi @Cataphract ,
RViz is a "debug" node (rosout and rqt_graph itself also).
When you open rqt_graph, I think that by default you have the Debug button checked. When this button is checked, all "debug nodes" are hidden.
If you want to show RViz on rqt_graph you have to "uncheck" the "Debug" button.
The list of nodes that are hidden can be found on a variable called QUIET_NAMES of rqt_graph.
Looking at the variable, we can see that every node that starts with one of the following values below are hidden when you "check" the Debug button on rqt_graph:
QUIET_NAMES = ['/diag_agg', '/runtime_logger', '/pr2_dashboard', '/rviz', '/rosout', '/cpu_monitor', '/monitor', '/hd_monitor', '/rxloggerlevel', '/clock', '/rqt', '/statistics']

If you prefer watch a video explaining this, I have created a one (https://youtu.be/uVK0Yp4ZDGc) that answers this question and show an example of how to add the /gazebo as a Debug Node (for learning purposes), by changing the QUIET_NAMES variable.
Cheers,
Ruben.
