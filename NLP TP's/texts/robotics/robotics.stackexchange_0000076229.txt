Q:

Problem while launching PMICP

Followed the following tutorial https://libpointmatcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ICPIntro/
It works well till I open cloud_0.vtk and cloud_1.vtk in PARAVIEW and at the next step of launching pmicp with an empty ICP configuration I get an error, I tried to copy paste the file from the tutorial, In that case the error is following:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'PointMatcher<float>::ConvergenceError'         
  what():  ErrorMnimizer: no point to minimize                
Aborted (core dumped)

and when I launched the same YAML in the package provided in the package, the output is very unexpected:
* KDTreeMatcher: initialized with knn=1, epsilon=0, searchType=1 and maxDist=inf             
match ratio: 0.900055       
ICP transformation:            
   0.993545   -0.113204  0.00724467    0.608055              
   0.113237    0.993559 -0.00431907 -0.00381928            
-0.00670904   0.0051116    0.999964   0.0106469                           
          0           0           0           1

Please help how to correct this.
