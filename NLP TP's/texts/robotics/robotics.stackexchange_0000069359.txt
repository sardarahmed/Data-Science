Q:

ROS3djs set URDF color not working

Hello! I've built my own robot in solidworks, so I have the 3D .dae parts. I also have the URDF model working on the web browser by the package ros3djs (http://wiki.ros.org/ros3djs/Tutorials/VisualizingAURDF). The problem is that when it displays the model on the web browser, each link gets a random color. I have set the color on the .dae file and also on the URDF file, but it's not working, every link keeps getting a random color.
I get the following errors on the webconsole:
mutating the [[Prototype]] of an object will cause your code to run very slowly; instead create the object with the correct initial [[Prototype]] value using Object.create roslib.min.js:1:7936

THREE.WebGLRenderer 61 three.min.js:1:285997

Error: WebGL: getExtension('MOZ_WEBGL_compressed_texture_s3tc'): MOZ_ prefixed WebGL extension strings are deprecated. Support for them will be removed in the future. Use unprefixed extension strings. To get draft extensions, set the webgl.enable-draft-extensions preference. three.min.js:1:285144

THREE.WebGLRenderer: Anisotropic texture filtering not supported. three.min.js:1:285412

THREE.WebGLRenderer: S3TC compressed textures not supported. three.min.js:1:285500

The use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated. Instead use the defaultPrevented. web.html

Do you think it could be related to not showing the correct colors?
Thank you very much! Regards.
Ruben

Have you tried switching your mesh loader?
