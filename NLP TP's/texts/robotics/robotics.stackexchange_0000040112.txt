Q:

ompl_ros_interface/tutorials: motion planning failed

Hello,
I was trying the simulation example in pr2 robot of this tutorial and when I enter the last command (rosrun example_ompl_tutorials ompl_joint_goal) the console answers "motion planning failed". In rxconsole it stated "Planning scene hasn't been set".
Anyone knows what happened? By the way I made sure to change all motion_planning_msgs for arm_navigation_msgs in the cpp file, since I'm using the electric version.
