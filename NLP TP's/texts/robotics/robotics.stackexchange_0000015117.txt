Q:

3D mapping using only datasets and no hardware

I am planning a project which compares the different techniques of 3D mapping of a setup. I understand that there are many algorithms to accomplish the same, but due to a non-existent hardware budget, I have to compare 3D techniques/algorithms that can be accomplished with the algorithm and datasets only. I have done a fair share of research that is still ongoing, but I was looking for assistance by people who may already have knowledge of this and can help me narrow down what I'm searching.
In summary, I am looking for 3D mapping techniques/algorithms that can be accomplished using only software and datasets in order to compare them on various performance and application parameters. Since I have to compare performance, all techniques should be applied on the same dataset.
I would appreciate any information, research papers, links, otherwise that could direct me.

A:

You need no hardware for this :) 
Check out OpenSLAM website, you'll find plenty of options for slam algorithms and dataset. A quick Google search gives you things such as the KITTI Dataset.
I particularly like this webpage to find datasets.
Most of those can be used with ROS so I would advise you to implement your comparison method in ROS. Then testing different slam algorithm and/or datasets is mainly a matter of (almost) plug and play.
