Q:

How to tune move_base local planners for frequent goal updates

I am experimenting with a robot which is supposed to follow a beacon outside. The waypoints are sent at 1Hz (I could go faster) and are within 3 to 10 meters of the robot. I tried using move_base with the built-in planners but had unsatisfactory results.

DWA planner's motion was good but it made the robot pause at every goal update making for unsmooth motion
TrajectoryPlannerRos starts oscillating on straightaways, that type of motion isn't acceptable
TebLocalPlanner was a mix of the two, but it did a lot of spinning in place and eventually would cause the map update loop miss its target update rate

I tried to play with oscillation reset flag and other parameters but still did not achieve good results and to be honest, I'm not really sure how most of these work. I am starting to think that these planners weren't meant to be used for what I'm using them for. Is there a better planner for me to use such that I can update it frequently yet still get the benefit of obstacle following? If not, are there parameters I should be tuning that will make path updates faster and smoother? (local map size/resolution? oscillation flag? others?)

A:

The issue is not with the planners, but with move_base.
