Q:

synch between gazebo and rviz

hi,
i have a question about the synchronisation between gazebo and rviz:
i have set up a world in gazebo with lots of obstacles but my rviz doesn't "see" any of them. i really don't know how to fix this.
thx

oh, that sounds logical. and how can i make the robot perceive the gazebo-world?

Use some simulated sensor, such as a laser range finder or kinect.

i have a sick_s300 sensor on my simulated robot but it still doesn't work. and is it normal that the laser scan moves in the rviz?

A:

Gazebo and Rviz are two different things.
Gazebo displays/provides the simulated "real" world. Rviz only displays what the robot sees (and any other program outputs to rviz). So as long as there is no data from the robot somehow perceiving the world, rviz won't show anything.
