A:

I use Blender, an open-source 3D modelling and animation program, to create my terrains. For example, you could try this tutorial to get you started. There is also the option to use the sculpt tool to create terrains. You can also use Blender to create other meshes.
Once I create my terrain, I then export the terrain to Collada 1.4 (.dae) using the built-in Blender Collada exporter. This format is readable by Gazebo.
Finally, to get the terrain into Gazebo, I copy the .dae file to my Gazebo "models" directory (see below). I then add the terrain to the .world file so that it is guaranteed to be static.
  <model:physical name="hill">
   <xyz>5.0 -5.0 0.1</xyz>
   <rpy>0 0 0</rpy>
   <static>true</static>
   <body:trimesh name="hill">
      <geom:trimesh name="hill">
        <scale>1.0 1.0 1.0</scale>
        <mesh>ground_profile_test.dae</mesh>
        <visual>
           <scale>1.0 1.0 1.0</scale>
           <mesh>ground_profile_test.dae</mesh>
        </visual>
      </geom:trimesh>
  </body:trimesh>
 </model:physical>

NOTE: You must configure your Gazebo media paths correctly. See here.

Ah I see, that at least clears up why I'm having those annoying problems. I'll update my Blender/COLLADA question accordingly. Thanks for the quick and enlightening answer.

Oh yes, I've received that error before. The problem comes from Blender > 2.49b. I don't know what's different in the COLLADA exporter, but it doesn't work. Thus, I still use Blender 2.49b. I have a "build" machine to do the exporting, so I can still use 2.6 on my main machine.

So the Blender .dae export works as intended for you? I get this if I use the .dae exported from Blender 2.61 directly: http://bit.ly/hills_bl . OTOH, if I just open this in meshlab and save as .dae again, I get this: http://bit.ly/hills_ml (but material info is obviously lost).

Are there any other options for rough terrains in Gazebo? The tutorial linked here seems old.
