Q:

Terminal freezes after roslaunch

Hello! i have a problem.I've written a roslaunch but if execute it and then ctrl-c the current window of the terminal freezes and i have to open a new one.
It's almost equal to others .launch files that do not give problem,except that in this one i passes some args to a node using: args="\dir\blabla.ext"
what could be the problem?

Can you post the launch file, what operating system, what version of ROS, etc? Need more info to help ... thanks!

A:

IIRC, teleop_base_keyboard takes input from the current terminal, so it's likely that its taking over the terminal that you are running roslaunch from.  You should run teleop_base_keyboard separately.
