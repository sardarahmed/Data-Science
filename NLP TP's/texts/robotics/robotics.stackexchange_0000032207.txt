Q:

Kinect for Navigation on Erratic Robot

I have a kinect fitted on an erratic robot base. So far I managed to get the kinect and base working separately in ROS using erratic_player and openni for kinect. I also tried kinect laser emulator provided by ardros and works nicely.
I had a look at tf and also tutorials however am a bit stuck on how to set up and link the kinect frame and erratic odometry frame onto a common frame for navigation stack.
I think I am missing something fairly basic which I cannot figure out.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

A:

Have you seen this tutorial: Robot Setup?
For your robot you basically need to provide two tfs: odom -> base_link (the odometry) and base_link -> base_laser (the laser/kinect position). For the latter you can use a static_transform_publisher.

Thanks for your answer. Yes I already had a look at Robot Setup tutorial and admittedly I got a bit lost there. This goes to show how beginner I am on ROS! I will give it another try and hopefully be able to create the TFs and link them as suggested.
