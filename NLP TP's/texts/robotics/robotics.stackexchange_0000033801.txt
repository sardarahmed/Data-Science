Q:

Most important things to know in ROS?

Hello,
I am new to ROS and Linux, so the command line interface is tricky for me to understand. As a beginner, I am wondering what everyone's tips are for the best things to know about ROS, important features, or valuable commands. I have recently purchased a TurtleBot and I am exited to get started with robotics.

A:

My own suggestion is try to run basic parts of ROS tutorials, and then focus the area which has tutorials to make some progress.
Basic : http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
All : http://www.ros.org/wiki/AllTutorials
If you have anything doesn't know just google and find similar questions.
if getting no answer then question here again.
