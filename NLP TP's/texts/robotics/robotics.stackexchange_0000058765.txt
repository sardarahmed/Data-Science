Q:

How to start gscam in groovy/hydro?

Hi,
There seems to be conflicting info about how to start and use gscam. http://wiki.ros.org/gscam states to go to the bin/ directory but http://answers.ros.org/question/91676/how-to-install-gscam/ mentions something entirely different. Also, when trying, I find that ~/.ros/camera_info doesn't exist. Shouldn't this be installed with gscam ?
Thanks

Hi,
it doesn't matter if you don't have your bin or the camera_info folder. Did you tried something and get errors?

Yes, I did. I exported GSCAM_CONFIG, started  "rosrun gscam gscam". Got the messages that it can't open the camera calibration file and that camera.yaml isn't found. It does start the stream but "rostopic list" doesn't show any /gscam topics.

A:

You have that warning because you didn't calibrate your camera. It's not an error, it's just a warning so you can still run your gscam. You won't have any /gscam topics, but something like /camera/camerainfo /camera/image_raw. Do you have something like that?

I did have those topics, now it's failing for some reason so have to figure out why.
Ok, had wrong framerate. So have those topics again.

So your gscam is running. Do you have other problems?
Comment by hvn on 2014-04-16:
OK, what's wrong with "rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw" that I get "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" ?

what did you put in your GSCAM_CONFIG? make sure your device is the good one
Comment by hvn on 2014-04-16:
If you mean like device=/dev/video0, yes it is. The whole GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb,framerate=25/1 ! ffmpegcolorspace"

try GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace"

same result
Comment by hvn on 2014-04-19:
OK, found out why it gives Illegal instruction. It seems that the AMD cpu can't handle (part of) rosrun.
