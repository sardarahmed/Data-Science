Q:

How to use global_costmap/costmap_updates for updating global costmap

I've already search through the Internet and still get no clue of how to update the global cost map in navigation node, hydro.
I've create a new package and subscribe to global costmap generated from SLAM, but the update is only occurs at the first time of lashing. In rviz everything is fine, the global map is update in realtime. Any answer will be appreciated.

Sorry for necroposting but there doesn't seem to be a tutorial about this... could you tell me more about how to use them jointly?
