Q:

catkin_create_rosjava_xx scripts/commands not found

I have installed ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. Have followed the instructions to setup rosjava from source mentioned in this link catking-rosjava-workspace
Now when I try to create an empty workspace catkin_create_rosjava_pkg, it returns command not found.
Here is my ROS environment variables.,
 env | grep ROS
 ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
 ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/kinetic/share
 ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
 ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
 ROS_DISTRO=kinetic
 ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/kinetic/etc/ros

Is catkin_create_rosjava_xx commands not supported anymore?
Please help.
