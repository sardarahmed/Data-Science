Q:

overlapping occupancy grid maps

Hi,
I need to overlap two pose estimation (from the particle filter) with the map asociated to each of them (the map is the same). After that i need to merge both maps.
As a first step I am choose one pose estimation as fixed and I am trying to rotate and translate the otherone to overlap the fixed one (map included). The problem is that I dont know how to rotate and translate de occupancy grid map.
An image with the problem description is attached.
Thanks in advance!

A:

I finaly could resolve this problem.
The way I did it was

Calculate the offset between fixed pose and the other pose
Create a frame (with tf2 tools) applying the translation and rotation between the poses
Then copy the original map, and set the frame_id with the frame created in 2)

You can see the results in the picture.
