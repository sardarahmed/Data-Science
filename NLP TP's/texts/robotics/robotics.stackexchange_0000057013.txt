Q:

update camera_info in ueye_cam

Hi,
I'm using the ROS package ueye_cam (fuerte branch) and I would like to know how update the camera_info.
I do the calibration with camera_calibration ROS package, I convert the calibration info in .yaml file and I put these files in /home/../.ros/camera_info.
If I run
roslaunch ueye_cam master_slaves_rgb8.launch  and I do rostopic echo /master/camera_info, I don't see the new value.
How can I update these values?
Thank you

A:

Currently there is a bug in ueye_cam's calibration parser, where it loads a yaml file, but parses the format of a Videre INI file instead. This will be fixed very soon. For the time being, you can manually modify the contents of your .yaml file according to the Videre INI specs (yuk, I know, sorry).
