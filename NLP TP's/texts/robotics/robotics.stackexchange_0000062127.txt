Q:

Which are the possible Software Architectures to use with ROS?

I am confused as to which software architecture to use above ROS. I am building a Mobile Robot for Navigation. Frobomind is one possible Architecture to use. But are there any more alternatives. Can anybody please share their experience with me.
Thanks

A:

I think you're asking about cognitive architectures, or the broader class of agent architectures. Following any of the links from those pages will be just a start in discovering alternatives.
You should know Rodney Brooks and the 'subsumption' architecture, since that kicked off a lot of architecture research back in the 80s/90s (and I might as well mention Shakey to really provide some history). Read something about 3T, SOAR, and ACT-R. You might want to read  Cognitive architectures: Research issues and challenges, P. Langley, 2009.
You might instead read the FroboMind paper (from their website), then follow up with any of the papers cited in the bibliography.
