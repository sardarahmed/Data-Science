i want to include a image. But it doesnt work. I dont now why. It shows ">5 points required to upload files" I try wih Chrom/ Internet Explorer - jpg/png/ and pdf ---- do you have any idea?

There is absolutely no need for attaching images. Error messages are text and can be copy-pasted, verbatim, from the terminal window into your question. Please do so.

thanks for your fast answers. I followed your advice

A:

Have you actually installed the wiki/grid_map_rviz_plugin package?

Edit: and seeing this:

lucas@lucas-VirtualBox:~$ source /home/lucas/projects/imagine/build/devel/setup.bash

can you tell us how you've setup your workspace?

Oh nice, i actually installed the wiki/grid_map_rviz_plugin package - it works. But i want to creat a package independent project in c++..
Why do I have to install the package? Why can not cmake with catkin contain the necessary files?

I don't understand what that means, but how do you expect things to work without having the plugin actually installed?

?
CMake ~= Catkin are build tools. They don't contain any code other than what is needed to be able to build software.
You're sort-of asking: "why does Visual Studio not contain/provide MS Word?"
