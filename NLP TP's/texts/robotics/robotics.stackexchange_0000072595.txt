Q:

How to install and launch Python node inside a virtualenv?

I'm writing a Python ROS node, and all the documentation seems to assume I've installed all my package dependencies into the global site-packages. Best practices in the Python world is to use a virtualenv. However, I can't find anything in the tutorials that mentions this. When launching my node, is it enough to source my virtualenv, or is there some special configuration I need to do first?

A:

If the python code was written by you and is part of one of your own ROS package then sourcing the ros workspace's devel/setup.bash will make all the python libraries available for import just like virtualenv does. These links should give enough info to set up a ros package to do so.
http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/installing_python.html

AFAIK there isn't any special configuration needed to use a virtualenv when developing Python nodes. I sourced devel/setup.bash in my ros workspace first, then sourced bin/activate in a virtualenv and found I was able to import modules from both the ros packages and the libraries installed in just the virtualenv.
