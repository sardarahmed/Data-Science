Q:

ExtrapolationException. Very small time difference?

Currently, I'm using IMU(Xsens) + Laser(Hokuyo).
Sometimes, below is problem. As you see, 0.04sec time difference. (Few sample difference). How can I solve this problem?
Note that all nodes are on same machine.
[ INFO] [1343387030.068372425]: lookupTransform base_stabilized to laser timed out. Could not transform laser scan into base_stabilized.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'tf::ExtrapolationException'
what():  Lookup would require extrapolation into the future.  Requested time 1343387030.103303000 but the latest data is at time 1343387030.065800000, when looking up transform from frame [/laser] to frame [/base_stabilized]

A:

Just use waitForTransform or tf::MessageFilter. Also, make sure you went through this tutorial.
