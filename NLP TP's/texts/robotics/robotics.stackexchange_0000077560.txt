Q:

How to know from where to import and the message type?

I am new to ROS, wanted to experiment with publishing and subscribing. The basic codes available are easy to run.
Now let us say I have downloaded a package, My_Pkg, in its msg folder there is a file my_msg.msg  where they have defined a message by name MSG.
My question is how do i publish or subscribe for this message:
The simple statement : pub=rospy.Publisher('topic_name', MSG)
Results in error that MSG is not defined.
If I import: from My_Pkg.MSG import MSG
Still error no module named Console.

A:

Solved it:
First Run rosmsg list, it will list all the messages, choose the one you were looking for so in above case it is simply:
from my_pkg.msg import MSG
and it works
