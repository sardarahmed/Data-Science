Q:

How to add prefix to "/set_camera_info" service?

Hi all,
I'm trying to advertise a camera image+info in order to calibrate it.
I create my info manager like follows :
camera_info_manager::CameraInfoManager info_mgr(nh, "webcam");

webcam is my camera name. Though, when I start the programme and ask for a "rosservice list" I only get :
/set_camera_info

with no prefix. What am I missing ?

A:

The API documentation specifies nh to be a ros::NodeHandle for the camera's streaming name space. You seem to have passed a node handle for the driver node, instead.
The second (cname) parameter has a different purpose. It attempts to identify which physical device the associated calibration describes. For that, a UUID or make, model and serial number are recommended.
Try something like this:
camera_info_manager::CameraInfoManager cinfo(ros::NodeHandle("webcam"));

That will advertise /webcam/set_camera_info.
