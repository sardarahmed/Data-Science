please specify ROS distro you are using. Did you install the package inside your ros workspace and then sourced the setup.bash properly? Check again. you should run $ source ~/your_ros_worskpace/devel/setup.bash after you run the catkin_make command to source properly.

indigo ros
and idont know how sourced the setup.bash

A:

I assume you followed the instructions for setting up your ROS environment tutorial.  You need to download the teleop_twist_keyboard from the github to your ~/catkin_ws/src folder.
Steps:

cd ~/catkin_ws/src

git clone https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard

cd ~/catkin_ws

catkin_make

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

source ~/.bashrc

I also assume you have your ros environment in your bashrc file. It should contain the following lines :
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash and you should add the following lines to your bashrc script by running :
gedit ~/.bashrc and add :
 source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

New terminals will pick up when you open it. Also, you will need to remap linear and angular velocity for your robot to the /cmd_vel topic to use the keyboard for teleoperation. I would suggest looking into turtlebot_teleop package for details.

I've removed the sudo for editing your bashrc. If you need sudo to edit your bashrc, the ownership or permissions are wrong, and you should fix them instead of editing your bashrc with sudo. Do: sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.bashrc and chmod 644 ~/.bashrc

@ahendrix I did not knew that. I always use the sudo to edit my bashrc. Good suggestion though thanks.
