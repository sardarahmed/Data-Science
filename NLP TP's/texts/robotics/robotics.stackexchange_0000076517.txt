Q:

epos_hardware_node can't find parameters

Hey,
i tryed to get the epos_hardware package ti work.
I have the right parameter in the yaml file and if i started the launch file directly with roslaunch mrd.launch it initalized the motors and I can send with the velocity commad the velocity to one motor.
But when i wnat to start it with the epos_hardware_node like it is told at the wiki I get
ae@AErobotNUC:~$ rosrun epos_hardware epos_hardware_node actuator_right
[ INFO] [1475145806.123784737]: Loading EPOS: actuator_right
[ERROR] [1475145806.133245540]: You must specify an actuator name
[ERROR] [1475145806.135072354]: You must specify a serial number
[ERROR] [1475145806.137558224]: You must specify an operation mode
[ INFO] [1475145806.137672590]: 
[ INFO] [1475145806.230669194]: Waiting for robot_description

I think that the problem is that the node doesn't get the parameter and so i tryed to start first the launch and then the node i get his
ae@AErobotNUC:~$ rosrun epos_hardware epos_hardware_node left
[ INFO] [1475146396.731178459]: Loading EPOS: left

[ERROR] [1475146396.854641495]: Could not configure motor: left
[FATAL] [1475146396.854699196]: Failed to initialize motors

I'm new at ROS and didn't unterstand the problem, thanks for help

A:

You should take a further review on the example launch file and fully understand what does. It calls the urdf and yaml yes and load them to the parameter server, But also calls epos_harware_node, without having more information about your launch file, urdfs and yamls it is a bit difficult to predict what is wrong.
Before I would be also check the output on list_devices node and be sure that everything is being detected, for further help you should specify more about the contex of your problem (devices etc)
