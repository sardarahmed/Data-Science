Q:

Experiment with tf2 in Python without a full ROS install

I am working on a mac and want to experiment and pay around with tf,  eigen and quaterions in a jupyter notebook without doing a full ros install (because AFAIK the Mac install for ROS is still problematic.) I am not sure how or what subset I would need to install to achieve this.

A:

Every package properly declares it's dependencies. If you pick any package from there you can introspect it's dependencies and build from there.
There are tools like the rosinstall_generator that can help you automatically resolve dependencies and help you get the source for the packages that you need.
