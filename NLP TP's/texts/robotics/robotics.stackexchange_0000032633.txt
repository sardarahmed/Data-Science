Q:

Help with Installing packages and repositories

I am trying to install a few different packages but am at a loss on getting them to work.
For example, I am trying to install usb_cam and getting this error
mkdir: cannot create directory `build': Permission denied
Also, when there is a repository how do I add it? I keep trying to find it in the documentation but if someone wouldn't mind giving me an example.
mary_tts or usb_cam would be a good working example for me to go by if someone doesn't mind helping.
Thanks!

A:

Generally you should not install packages by hand in system directories such as /opt/ros/diamondback. People normally create an overlay in their home directory. An easy way of creating such an overlay (and installing stacks/packages) is by using rosinstall. To create an overlay in ~/ros, you can do the following:
rosinstall ~/ros /opt/ros/diamondback

Then replace the line
source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash

in your ~/.bashrc with the line
source ~/ros/setup.bash

Now, if you want to install a new stack that is not available as a debian package (e.g. bosch_drivers which contains usb_cam), execute the following:
roslocate info bosch_drivers > ~/bosh_drivers.rosinstall
rosinstall ~/ros ~/bosh_drivers.rosinstall

After opening a new terminal to reload setup.bash you will have the package usb_cam in your package path and you should be able to rosmake it.

Thanks! Okay. I tried rosinstall and roslocate, but both are  command not found. I looked them up and they should be installed when I set up ROS?
