Are there new expected dates for release of Groovy and Hydro distros?

Hi, this because in http://www.ros.org/wiki/Distributions info has not been updated.

A:

Expect Groovy release one of these days, and the given date for Hydro should still remain as planned, making Hydro more of a patch release.
