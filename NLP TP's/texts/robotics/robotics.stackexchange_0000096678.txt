Q:

Finding the location of a ROS node

As part of my ROS re-education, I have been experimenting with the TurtleSim.
I understand that the following command:
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

..means execute turtlesim_node located in the turtlesim package. But I execute roscd turtlesim and listing the contents of that package, I can't locate the turtlesim node. The tree structure is shown below:
/opt/ros/melodic/share/turtlesim$ tree
.
├── cmake
│   ├── turtlesimConfig.cmake
│   ├── turtlesimConfig-version.cmake
│   ├── turtlesim-msg-extras.cmake
│   └── turtlesim-msg-paths.cmake

└── srv
    ├── Kill.srv
    ├── SetPen.srv
    ├── Spawn.srv
    ├── TeleportAbsolute.srv
    └── TeleportRelative.srv

Can anyone help me understand how to pinpoint and locate the turtlesim, or any target, node?

A:

If you installed turtlesim using sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-*** then it would be somewhere like this /opt/ros/melodic/lib/turtlesim. Roscd for installed packaged would take you to the include folder (I think).
If you catkin_maked the source code, then it would be in devel/lib/.

Thank you. It was in the directory you specified and not roscd turtlesim.
I found it but it didn't help my learning process as I hoped. The script is in binary.

Yeah, it is an executable. But if you are looking to learn about the source code try https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.
