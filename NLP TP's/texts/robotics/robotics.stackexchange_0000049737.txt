A:

Each ROS distro is built with its own consistent copy of Gazebo, plus some plugins for working in a ROS environment.
To install the Fuerte version on Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-simulator-gazebo

EDIT: looks like your problem is with the Hector plugins, themselves. Does this help?
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-hector-gazebo

If you already had the package installed, why are you trying to build it?
