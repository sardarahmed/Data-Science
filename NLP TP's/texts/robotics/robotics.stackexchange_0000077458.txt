Q:

rtabmap ignore odometry

Can i set rtabmap_ros to ignore the odometry of the robot?
At this moment the odometry of the robot is not good enough and will start to conflict with rtabmap resulting in a robot not knowing its position.

A:

Hi,
rtabmap_ros requires odometry to work. The odometry can come from the robot (wheel odometry) or any other sources like visual odometry. rtabmap_ros has a rgbd_odometry node that can be used to generate visual odometry for convenience. You will have to disable odometry from your robot (at least the TF) if you use another source of odometry.
cheers

Hi! I'm trying to use rgbd_odometry instead of wheel odom. Do you have any suggestions on how to disable odom from robot in TF? I also posted a question here.
