Q:

XMLRPC and Nodes

Is there a single XMLRPC server running for all of the topics that are registered under a given node? Or does each topic maintain its own server? If there is a single XMLRPC server for all of the topics, at what point does communication switch to the new connection between subscriber/publisher -- is it immediately after the requesting the topic or does the connection header get exchanged first?

A:

There's one XMLRPC server per node. The XMLRPC communication is documented here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Technical%20Overview
