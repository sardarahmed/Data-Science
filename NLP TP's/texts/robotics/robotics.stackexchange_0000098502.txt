Q:

Unable to Build my workspace due to errors in building industrial core (Required for Kuka Arm for Ubuntu 20.04.02-Noetic)?

I followed this link to install kuka_experimental
http://wiki.ros.org/kuka_experimental
It didn't satisfy all the dependencies and gave this error that industrial_robot_client package was missing.
I installed Industrial Core from source using this link.
https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core.git
When i ran this:
# checking dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src

I got an error that a dependency orocos_kdl package is missing.
I installed it from https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics.git
Based on the error i setup a path for the packages to access python2 for building, referring this.
https://www.fosslinux.com/39384/switching-between-python-2-and-3-versions-on-ubuntu-20-04.htm
This resolved and build most of the packages but there are some errors that persisted.
I have added my error message which i got during catkin build.
