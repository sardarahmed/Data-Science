Q:

Data Acquisition DAQ Hardware?

I'm wondering what sort of DAQ hardware people are generally using?  I have various AnalogIO and DigitalIO needs, and bought a National Instruments USB-6211 DAQ.  It turns out that NI doesn't support their USB cards on Linux, nor support any cards on Ubuntu.  (worst case I may be able to run a separate Windows machine with a ROS node to do the DAQ stuff).
Since analog and digital input/output are common among roboticists, is there a DAQ card that works well on ROS and Ubuntu?  Thanks.
Steve.

In particular, I need to do some fairly fast analog output, on the order of a couple hundred kS/sec, on two channels.  None of the NCD devices seem to be very fast, and none of the Arduino solutions are very fast either.  I could use an AVR with a DAC, but I'd like an off-the-shelf solution.

A:

So far I've been able to get away with just using an arduino.  The arduino has a 10 bit ADC, usually with a reference voltage of 5V--so you get a detectable voltage variation of 5/1023 or .0049 volts (4.9 mV), that coupled with a 16MHz process means you can get a respectable sampling rate (in kHz).  It's cheap too (< $100)--that always helps.

In noisy environments, Arduinos don't work well. But these boards are more robust against noise. In addition, for many applications, such as controlling an industrial ac motor, we need to provide a voltage range in [-10,+10], which is impossible to generate with Arduino.

A solution for the problem that I have addressed is to design an op-amp circuit to....
But, that circuit will not work as good as a prepared package like NI Instruments DAQ cards.
