Q:

Which kind of motors and how powerfull should they be for a robotic arm

I am building a robotic arm with these specifications:

1 meter long
approx. 1kg weight
it is made of 4 motors. (2 at the base. One for rotating the whole arm left and right and another one for rotating up down. 1 motor for rotating the second half of the arm, only up and down. 1 for the claw used for grabbing)
it must be able to lift at least 4kg + 1kg (it's own weight), and have a speed of 180 degrees in 2 seconds = 360 degrees in 1 second resulting 60rpm.

Which kind of motor would be best for the project (servo or stepper) and how much torque will it need? (Please also give me an explanation of how I can calculate the torque needed). Could you also give me an example or two of the motors I would need and/or a gearbox for them (models or links).

This type of question "how much torque does my robot arm need" has been answered many times on this site:

Simple equation to calculate needed motor torque
Design and construction of universal robotic arm (5kg, 1m)

Choice of a motor for robotic arm

The equation for torque is pretty simple.  It is just force times moment arm length.  So the lift motor at the base of the arm will require: 4 kg * 1 m + 1 kg * 0.5 m = 4.5 kg m, or about 44 Nm.  The elbow motor will require 4 kg * 0.5 m + 0.5 kg * 0.25 m = 2.125 kg m, or about 21 Nm.
