This could be a number of things. I'd read the network setup tutorial and make sure it's correct. Also, ensure the routing is set correctly in your VPN and there aren't any firewalls in the way.

There is a good question with answers on how to setup an openvpn here: https://answers.ros.org/question/11045/how-to-set-up-vpn-between-ros-machines/
To use your android you'll likely need to connect it to a gateway that's forwarding the local network over the vpn.
