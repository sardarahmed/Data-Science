Q:

rosbag tools for bag operation

I recently started to work exhaustively with rosbag.
Also started with extracting videos out of it and also start writing my own tools for timestamp manipulation (which was a nice exercise btw).
But then I found that there already exist tools for all these task.
Before I start writing more tools for bag operations, I'd like to ask what other repositories/packages/tools exist.
Edit:
I put the (hopefully ever-growing list) into an answer, so that this question gets more attention
Please send more suggestions!

This post on ros discourse last week for "Qt rosbag exporter", which is a Qt based GUI for working with bag files.

Just awesome! Thanks for the hint! I'll put it in the list.

In a totally different technology (web based), there is https://marvhub.com and https://github.com/ternaris/marv-robotics who works on bag files for displaying informations on the web (the best example i found : https://marvhub.com/#/detail/q4mwxc3epkcqpqhiyoru7xclii )

@Imathieu This is just mindblowing. Never thought of such possibilities! I will directly integrate this into my work! Thanks for this awesome tip.

@tik0 if you are looking to manipulate/log simple text-based data, here's a little something I wrote: https://gist.github.com/PrieureDeSion/f9e185ec14556e905373c5be72718d6d
It may be of use for quick processing and extraction.

Found another toolset from this post, which is able to trim and merge bag files: https://answers.ros.org/question/10683/is-there-a-way-to-merge-bag-files/

A:

So the hopefully ever-growing list to work with bag files is as follows:

Native rosbag
http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag
https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/tree/kinetic-devel/tools/rosbag/scripts
http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Cookbook
http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/rosbag/html/index.html
bag tools
http://wiki.ros.org/bag_tools
rqt_bag
http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_bag
http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_bag_plugins
rqt_bag_exporter
https://gitlab.com/InstitutMaupertuis/rqt_bag_exporter
https://discourse.ros.org/t/qt-rosbag-exporter/4964
MARV Robotics (extensible data management platform)
Code: https://github.com/ternaris/marv-robotics
Example: https://marvhub.com/#/collection/bags
Example: https://marvhub.com/#/detail/q4mwxc3epkcqpqhiyoru7xclii
Matlab solutions
native robotics toolbox: https://de.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ref/rosbag.html
(tested and working well): https://github.com/unl-nimbus-lab/bag2matlab
(untested): https://github.com/bcharrow/matlab_rosbag
Various bag tools (trimming, merging, editing, ... bag files)
bagtools: https://bitbucket.org/daniel_dube/bagedit/wiki/Home
Rosbag Editor: https://github.com/facontidavide/rosbag_editor
rosbag_fixer (work around message header's missing dependency information): https://github.com/gavanderhoorn/rosbag_fixer
Thread on Importing Rosbag in Python 3
Bag export to other formats
This is not well supported. So the best way is to export the bag to CSV which can then be converted using pandas, for instance
Thread on rosbag to npz or h5 conversion

Edit

Added Matlab solutions
Add toolset for trimming and merging bag files
Add Rosbag Editor
Add rosbag_fixer
Add bag export

As I found myself working more and more with rosbag files this is very useful, is there a place where we should put this list on the wiki?
Comment by tik0 on 2018-06-29:
Also thought about that. But do you have anything in mind? From my point of view the ROS wiki might not be optimal, since this topic is very generic.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-07-18:
Could add gavanderhoorn/rosbag_fixer:

Replaces incomplete msg defs with the correct ones in bags with topics published by rosjava

Works around rosjava/rosjava_bootstrap#16.
Would be better to have an actual fix committed, but that would depend on someone picking that issue up and actually solving it.
