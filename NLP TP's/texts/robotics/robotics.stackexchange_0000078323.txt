Q:

Turtlebot installation

Hi,
I am trying to install turtlebot ..on my system containing Ubuntu-16.04 LTS and ROS-Kinetic.
I am following instructions from: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Turtlebot%20Installation
As mentioned in the webpage the tried the following command for
Ubuntu Package Install:

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps ros-indigo-turtlebot-interactions ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator ros-indigo-kobuki-ftdi ros-indigo-rocon-remocon ros-indigo-rocon-qt-library ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar-msgs

As i am using Ros-kinetic i replaced indigo in the above command line with kinetic. (Is the replacement necessary ?)
The following message is displaced on the command window:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-rocon-remocon
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-rocon-qt-library
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-ar-track-alvar-msgss
Later, i also tried Source Installation..
When i used the command:
wstool init src -j5 https://raw.github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_tools/master/rosinstalls/kinetic/kobuki.rosinstall
The following message got diplayed:
Using initial elements from: https://raw.github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_tools/master/rosinstalls/kinetic/kobuki.rosinstall
ERROR in config: Unable to download URL [https://raw.github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_tools/master/rosinstalls/kinetic/kobuki.rosinstall]: HTTP Error 404: Not Found
I also tried the same above command with indigo:
wstool init src -j5 https://raw.github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_tools/master/rosinstalls/indigo/kobuki.rosinstall
The file got downloaded but after using catkin_make
It throughed an error:
ins/src/gazebo_ros_kobuki.cpp:8:
/usr/include/c++/5/bits/c++0x_warning.h:32:2: error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
#error This file requires compiler and library support \
How can i used -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 in catkin_make command ?

Please ask the compile issue is a separate question with full context and include the full command and console output etc for us to better help you debug.

A:

That tutorial is for Indigo but your urls are for kinetic those urls don't exist for kinetic. I don't believe that the code has been changed so likely the indigo urls will work.
