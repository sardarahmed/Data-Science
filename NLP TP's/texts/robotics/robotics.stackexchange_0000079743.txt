Q:

Multiple instances of nodelets

In my application I am planning to convert a node to a nodelet. Before going ahead with my implementation I want to clarify some doubts.

In the application I am currently running multiple instances of a node. If I port that node to nodelet, is it possible to    have multiple nodelet instances as in nodes?

If that provision was not there what was the best way to implement zero copy mechanism of nodelts.

Thanks in advance

A:

yes.
As long as you provide a different name for each instance (same as with nodes).
