Q:

Does roscpy has any meaning?

I came across a package namely robot_arm_ros. And in the subpackage robot_arm_navigation i found this:
<build_exec>roscpy<build_exec>

I thought roscpy at first was only a typo( for rospy) but it was written 2 times. So i wonder if there was really a roscpy that was deprecated long ago. And does rospy interpret the script or compile it into executables (that might explain the name roscpy) ?

A:

No, this is most likely a typo.
The two client libraries would be roscpp and rospy.

And does rospy interpret the script or compile it into executables (that might explain the name roscpy) ?

The Python interpreter interprets Python code. It does not turn them into executables (in the traditional sense of the word, ie: executable binaries).
