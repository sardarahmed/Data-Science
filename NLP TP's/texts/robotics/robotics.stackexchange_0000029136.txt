Q:

Is a message in gazebo always a ROS message?

Hey,
I found the Publisher.hh in the code and was wondering, if all messages in Gazebo are ROS messages.
The question came to my mind, because if I want to get an image from a ROS node, it is in the ROS image format and not in the previous Float32. But if I could access the picture without sending it by ROS I could skip the converting step back to openCV.
Thank you for your answers
