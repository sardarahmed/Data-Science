Q:

Future of ROS, Willow Garage, PR2

Hi,
What do pioneers of the ROS Community think about the future of ROS. Could you point me to some good articles or magazine/newspaper interviews on this topic?
What do they make of the end of Willow Garage and the PR2 platform last year? And what does the OSRF and the numerous spinoffs think of the future?
Is there a common goal as for the future of ROS?
Thank you.
PS - Let me know if this question is not appropriate for this forum. I will take it down.

A:

ROS is alive and well.
OSRF has been the primary maintainer of ROS for over 18 months now, and in that time they're released ROS Hydro and ROS Indigo.
OSRF is currently working on ROS 2.0, which will feature significant improvements, including a better API, masterless operation with improved discovery, and greatly enhanced QoS capabilities.
The ROS developer community is meeting for ROSCon on September 12th and 13th, and I've heard rumors that it's already starting to fill up.
The PR2 platform is not obsolete; it is still supported by Clearpath Robotics and by the PR2 research community.

Thank you very much for that answer. Is the goal to get ROS in commercial applications in the industry? Or is ROS Industrial a separate effort?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-08-19:
The ROS Industrial consortium is one member of the ROS community, and they're focusing on using ROS to solve new problems with industrial applications. There will be at least two talks related to ROS-Industrial at ROSCon.

There are also a number of other commerial robotics applications that are being built using ROS. You may want to read the ROS blog and do some research on the companies that are sponsoring ROSCon this year to get a feel for the places where ROS is already in use.

If you'd like to find out more about the state of ROS, consider attending the upcoming ROSCon or catch the videos which will be posted after the event on the website..
