Q:

How to view full model's center of mass?

I know that you can view the center of mass for each link, but how can I graphically see the center of mass for the full model? If no tool for this is available, how should I approach creating my own? (I'm guessing that this is what a plugin would be for, right?)

A:

Gazebo doesn't provide this functionality out of the box. You could create a model plugin which calculates the CoM and publishes a marker at that position.
