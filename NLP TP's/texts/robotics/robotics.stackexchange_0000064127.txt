Q:

Difficulty installing and running openni_tracker on Hydro

I am trying to install and run openni_tracker on a turtlebot laptop running hydro. When I try to run the openni_tracker after installing it with sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-tracker we get this error:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/openni_tracker/openni_tracker: error while loading shared libraries: liborocos-kdl.so.1.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

A:

It looks like the version of the openni tracker that you're trying to install was built against a newer version of KDL. You should probably upgrade all of your installed packages to pull in the most recent build of KDL and upgrade all of the packages that might be built against the old version:
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
