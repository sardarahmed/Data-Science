Q:

Virtual robot controller?

Hello,
I'm working with a physical robot with a physical controller, but I can not always be in front of it.
Is there a way to connect me to a virtual controller(in my case, FS100) to test my programs?

I'm assuming you mean ROS application when you say programs in your question, not MotoPlus applications.

Motoman has MotoSim, but I don't think it can run the MotoPlus application from the motoman_driver package, which would be required to properly simulate a real system. It does run INFORM programs. It also seems to support kinematic simulation of the manipulator.
The industrial_core metapackage includes a node called the industrial_robot_simulator, which implements the same ROS API as all the other ROS-Industrial drivers. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for an actual driver node, but currently only performs simple joint state interpolation (while adhering to velocity & acceleration constraints). Lacking a real simulator it is probably the easiest option though.
Another option (but this would require some work), is to create a version of your urdf that can be simulated using Gazebo. Afaik, only the SIA10D urdf contains the necessary tags right now. You would still need to interface it with the appropriate Gazebo controllers though.

I might've missed something, so pinging @sedwards.
