Q:

[ROS2] Python launch documentation

Hi,
Is there comprehensive documentation regarding ROS2's Python-based launch system?
I found examples and many questions/replies here, but I cannot find complete documentation reporting all the available data structures, their parameters, and their usage.
Sometimes is really not easy to understand how to perform a task that may be really simple.
Thank you,
Walter

No. There are very spare informations about that and some tutorials are completerly wrong, because no more updated since long time. At the end I finish looking
into the github code itself trying to understand, how the code works

That's exactly what I'm doing... but something it's easy to miss something better than what you are doing

A:

The documentation of ROS 2 should be improved. This cookbook could help with some points. I'm also making this project to study, maybe you could find some useful examples of launch files
