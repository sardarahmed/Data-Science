Q:

Gazebo - joints control in position

Hi Guys!
I'm new of gazebo world. I've build a little arm with 3 links and 2 joints. With the user interface i can assign a forse to a joint or a position too (in degree for example). I cannot find a way to do the same thing by the topics or services (i need to set position but i've find just this service: gazebo/apply_joint_effort  but this don't help me)
Thank you!

which version of ros/gazebo are you using?

A:

Hi,
How about creating a plugin, where you can access the joints and apply forces on them?
Here is a plugin example.
One possibility for getting the joint and applying a force on it would be something like:
physics::ModelPtr my_model = _parent;
physics::JointPtr my_joint = my_model->GetJoint("name_of_joint");
my_joint->SetForce(0, 3.0);
Cheers,
Andrei
