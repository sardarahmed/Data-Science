Q:

Plotting location using wheel encoder data

Context: I am working with the SFU Mountain Dataset [http://autonomylab.org/sfu-mountain-dataset/]
The UGV image - via the SFU Mountain Dataset website:

I have used the following state update equations (Husky A200 - differential drive)
State Update - from Prob. Robotics, Thrun et. al [x' y' theta'] represent the state at the next time step

After plotting the x and y positions based on just the wheel encoder data (v_fwd and w -> the dataset provides these directly, instead on the vr and vl), the curve seems to be quite weird and unexpected.
Wheel Odometry Data - http://autolab.cmpt.sfu.ca/files/datasets/sfu-mountain-workshop-version/sfu-mountain-torrent/encoder-dry-a.tgz
Blue - Wheel Odom  |  Red - GPS

Actual path!

Question: Is the above curve expected (considering the inaccuracy of wheel odometry) or is there something I'm missing? If the wheel encoder data is that bad, will an EKF (odom + imu) even work?
PS: I'm not worried about the EKF (update step) just as yet. What concerns me more is the horrible wheel odometry data.

A few things:

I took a look at your data set. Did you make sure you used the time column correctly? The first entry is "1429481388546050050" without the decimal. To make it in seconds, it should be 1429481388.546050050.
Your motion model is fine (I've used it before, for people who want to see it derived, it is very similar to this one). However, to avoid dividing by zero, you should be checking the value for angular velocity, and if it below a certain threshold, you need to change it to

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{k+1} \\ y_{k+1} \\ \theta_{k+1}
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_k \\ y_k \\ \theta_k
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
v_k\Delta t\cos(\theta_k) \\ v_k\Delta t\sin(\theta_k) \\ \omega_k\Delta t
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The wheel encoders on the Husky are actually pretty good. If you can get your hands on the raw data (i.e., the ticks), you might get a better result. However, this requires that it was somewhat well calibrated (i.e., how many ticks per metre of travel).
If this were an indoor test, I would tell you that yes, you should definitely get better results. But it looks like the Husky was travelling on pretty rough terrain. If you've compensated for the two things I mentioned, it might just be the tough environment!
