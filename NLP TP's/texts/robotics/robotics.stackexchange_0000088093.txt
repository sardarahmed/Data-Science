Q:

joy_node using ~3gb of RAM

I haven't been able to find any other reports of this issue, but when running joy_node on my robot, it appears to have a memory leak, jumping in memory use every few seconds, until it consumes all of the available system memory. There was a similar issue reported here: link text, but it appears to have been fixed.

Whoops, set the rosconsole level to DEBUG, mistakenly attributed to joy_node
