Q:

How to estimate proper heading angle

I obtain the heading or yaw angle from a source which I am not allowed to modify, but when the angle goes more than +180 or -180, it interchanges either from 180 to -180 or the other way around. Any suggestion on how to overcome this drastic angle changes will be appreciated.
Here is the plot of angle changes over time,

Update after @Chuc comment,
Here is what I feel like desired behaviour

A:

Based on your comment:

if I am able to get 0 to 2pi, would be enough as well.

The following code will do it:
modifiedHeading = SensorOutput();
if(modifiedHeading < 0)
{
    modifiedHeading += 360f;
}

But, as I've mentioned previously, you still have the jump discontinuity, but you've moved it from the 359/1 degree range from the 179/-179 degree range.
