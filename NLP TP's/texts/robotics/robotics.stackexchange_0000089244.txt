Q:

Ros-win ros-catkin-tools install fail

Hi,
I've tried to install ros-win as described in here: https://ros-win.visualstudio.com/_git/ros-win?path=%2Fdoc%2FSetup.md&version=GBmaster
At the last step the ros-catkin-tools installation is failed, but the ros-melodic-desktop seems to install correctly.
Here's the error message:
ERROR: The running command stopped because the preference variable "ErrorActionPreference" or common parameter is set to Stop: Exception: The upgrade of ros-catkin-tools was NOT successful. Error while running 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\ros-catkin-tools\tools\chocolateyinstall.ps1'. See log for details.

I checked the log, but there is no additional information regarding the problem, or I can't find it. The installation is quite straightforward so I don't know where did I miss anything.
Anyone can guess what I did wrong?

Can you run choco upgrade ros-catkin-tools again and post the full console output? The package was just getting updated and the version of 0.0.1.1810092059 comes with some fixes for this symptom. Maybe you can give it try?

I've installed on a different computer and it worked now. It is maybe because of the new version, I'll check is tomorrow.

Glad to hear it worked now! :)

A:

You should:

remove all related ROS files in Chocolatey lib folder. In windows: C:/Programdata/chocolatey/lib.
remove the content of opt folder.
upgrade the package in chocolatey again.
