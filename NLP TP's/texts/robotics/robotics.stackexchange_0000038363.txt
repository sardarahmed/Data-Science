Q:

Start/Stop node at runtime?

Hi,
is there a nice ROS-way to start a node at runtime (using C++) and after some time stop it again (without using system() etc.)?

A:

At least for killing there is an xmlrpc shutdown call, which is what rosnode kill uses. That is probably the ROS'iest way to do it. Sending SIGINT would also be OK as ROS installs a SIGINT handler.
