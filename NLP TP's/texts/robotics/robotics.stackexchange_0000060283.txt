Q:

Global variable x is not defined

Hello guy !
I am getting a following error
Global variable x is not defined.
def where1(msg):
    global x1
    x1 = msg.data
def where2(msg):
    global y1
    y1 = msg.data

def ground():
    global cmd
    cmd = rospy.Publisher("/atrv/motion", Twist)
    rospy.init_node("ground")   
    rospy.Subscriber("/box_positiona", Float64, where1)
    rospy.Subscriber("/box_positionb", Float64, where2)
    print x1
    print y1
    rospy.spin() # this will block untill you hit Ctrl+C
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ground()

Thanks, looking forward for answers
