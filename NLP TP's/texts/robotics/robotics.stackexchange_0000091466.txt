Q:

what is the use of ROS_INFO_NAMED and ROS_INFO_THROTTLE?

i got the error while using ROS_INFO_THROTTLE..SO for this we have any need to use different header files?

This doesn't explain NAMED fully (does the log end up in rosout/stdout for instance?) but the explanation for THROTTLE is good http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Logging

If you got a compilation error you are likely using an older version of ros that doesn't have support for throttle (kinetic or earlier?)

This answer #q209522 says the name variable overrides the node name (or is it appended to the node name with a dot as the wiki suggests?)

A:

Here is an example of ROS_INFO_THROTTLE. It prints at most once per second.
ROS_INFO_THROTTLE (1.0, "Waiting for startup to finish");

Here is an example of ROS_INFO_NAMED. It logs to a logger named my_package:
ROS_INFO_NAMED("my_package", "Info log from my library.");

All of these macros are included if you #include <ros/ros.h> .

The named loggers go to the same file, but they have separate verbosity level that can be adjusted with rqt_logger_level ( http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_logger_level?distro=melodic )
So for example, you can use a named logger and set it to show DEBUG messages, even though the rest of your logging is still set to only show INFO or WARN.
