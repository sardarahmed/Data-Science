Q:

How to configure Eclipse to properly load a plugin?

I am trying to use Eclipse to debug the navigation stack (or debug how I am mis-using the stack). I have created an Eclipse project for move_base (make eclipse-project in move_base package), but am unsure how to deal with the plugins that need to be loaded. During initialization of the MoveBase class I get the following error:
[rospack] couldn't find package [nav_core]
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'pluginlib::LibraryLoadException'
  what():  rospack could not find the nav_core package containing nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner

I appreciate that many ROS developers use command line tools, but I have enjoyed using Eclipse on simpler projects. Is there an Eclipse project configuration step that I am likely missing to allow loading/debugging of plugins?

I'm launching it off a program launcher, but I set up the ROS environment variables in the Launch Configuration Properties/Environment window. It works fine for ROS nodes distributed across multiple computers.

Hi, are you starting eclipse from the command line, to get all your environment variables (ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, etc...). I'm not really sure if that's your problem as I'm not using eclipse myself, but I remember reading something about this a while ago. Cheers

A:

The Eclipse environment variables needed to define ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Added this variable and problem solved.
