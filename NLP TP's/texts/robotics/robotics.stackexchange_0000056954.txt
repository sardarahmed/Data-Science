Q:

Roslaunch does not exit after processes finish

Hello!
I've created a roslaunch that does all the work and finished cleanly. The problem is that it stays alive and to fully terminate the program I need to ctrl-c. I've read in an old ticket that it's because the core keeps running (for non-specified reasons).
Is it possible to force the launch to exit after all processes end?

A:

I believe you're looking for the required="true" option to the <node> tag in roslaunch.
Take a look at the description of the node tag for more information.
