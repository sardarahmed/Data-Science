Q:

How to stream the /camera/rgb/image_color from Kinect to another workstation

Hello,
I have a laptop connected to a Turtlebot with a Kinect. I have been able to get the live video of the kinect through rviz. I also am able to connect from another machine to the laptop via ssh. However, I have not been able to get the video from the kinect displayed on the other machine. When i try this via ssh
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color

(image_color:10277): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:

Is there anyway I can access the /camera/rgb/image_color using a vlc player or something of that sort?
Thanks,
Ian

A:

The other computer should be able to connect on other ports, ssh only forwards one port. Are the two machines on the same network? You should create a listener that knows the other ros_master_uri. Perhaps vlc with the correct ip and port number also works.
