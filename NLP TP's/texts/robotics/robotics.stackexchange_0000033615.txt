Q:

Why import complicated stl file will caused problem on gazebo?

My cad translate to stl file is

I use meshlab to view it:

But when I import to gazebo.
 sam@/home/sam/code/ros/gazebo/stl$ rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file      `pwd`/foot.urdf -urdf -model foot_model -z 100.5
 loading model xml from file
 attempting to spawn robot in simulation
 waiting for service spawn_urdf_model
 spawn status:  SpawnModel: successfully spawned model
 spawning success True
 
 sam@/home/sam/code/ros/gazebo/stl$

The model seems very weird even broken to parts.

How to solve it? Thank you~~

I have added the picture in meshlab, and I also upload the stl file:    http://www.adrive.com/public/8796d1359372a369f97531afc9a972ad728f8e47d46b8746e2a3242b27619be4.html

you can try and import the stl file with some other mesh editors such as meshlab or wings3d (or blender if the top image was not a stl import).  If things look ok there, can you post the STL file?  thanks.

Single STL. I haven't tried Multiple STL's connected by joints.

Hi Sam, is this a single STL?  Multiple STL's connected by joints?

A:

It looks like the mesh contains faces that are not 2-manifolds.  I recommend shrink-wrapping the mesh with one of the modern cad packages.

what software are you using to generate STL from CAD model?
Comment by sam on 2011-08-24:
I already use the smallest resolution option of stl export.Is there any other way to shrink-wrapping the mesh? Or how to import it to gazebo correctly?
