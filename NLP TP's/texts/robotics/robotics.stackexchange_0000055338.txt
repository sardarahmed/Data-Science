Q:

arm motion planning

I've noticed that there are two tutorial sets for arm navigation (arm_navigation and move_arm). Are the tutorials for arm_navigation still usable despite being for electric and diamondback?

The code really doesn't change from version to version, the only major update was the shift from rosbuild to catkin.  If you are using hydro and the tutorials require publishing transforms, you may have to look at the new tf2 they just released.  I'm not sure if its backwards compatible.

actually I Use groovy. I only ask this question Because the motion planing tutorials have got me quite confused on where to start for my custom robot.

A:

If you're starting on developing new manipulation code now, I'd strongly suggest you use MoveIt on Hydro instead, because arm_navigation has been deprecated now. It's only working in Fuerte (and half-working in Groovy); from Hydro on, there won't be any more arm_navigation.
