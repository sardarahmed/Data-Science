Q:

Can the DENSO VS060 package run the DENSO VE026A arm?

My understanding is all DENSO arms run using B-Cap, on which the DENSO VS060 ROS package is based. If this is true, then will the DENSO VE026A (academic robot) run using the same ROS package?

A:

VS060 ROS packages uses slave mode of B-Cap, if VE026A runs with that mode, it should work. So please try them and if it does not work, please add comments at https://github.com/start-jsk/denso/issues/18

Thanks for the reply! The VE026A does run in slave mode, however it requires a serial connection rather than an Ethernet.
