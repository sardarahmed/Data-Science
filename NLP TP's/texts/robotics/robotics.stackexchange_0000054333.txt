Q:

Error while using cmake install for sphero_ros

I have been trying to install sphero_ros following the instructions given here (I'm sorry I can't publish links. They are present at github mmwise sphere)
I get the following error when I do catkin_make install
error: option --install-layout not recognized
CMake Error at sphero_ros/sphero_driver/catkin_generated/safe_execute_install.cmake:4 (message):

Please help me overcome this:

A:

Looks like your setup.py is not taking the --install-layout option. This might be related to your Setuptools or Distribute Python modules. Can you check what versions of those you have? What OS are you using?
