Q:

the scale problem of libviso2

Hello!
I use my own images to run libviso2, but the result is not very well. There existed a scale problem in both mono and stereo program. There are two sample rates in my experiments. One is 5 m/frame, another is 1 m/frame. The results showed between two consecutive frames, the distance in stereo system are about 10 meters and 2 meters respectively. However, in mono system the distance are about 1 meters and 0.2 meters respectively. How can I solve it?
Thank you!

A:

In mono odometry, the scale is a parameter you have to fix. From two consecutive frames  it's impossible to compute scale.
Using stereo image pairs for each frame helps reduce error and provides additional depth and scale information.
