Q:

How do I install and build fovis_ros?

Hello,
I'm attempting to install and use fovis_ros, and I feel as though I'm missing something. I did the following in a top-level ROS workspace:

cd /src

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-fovis

Apparently there's no binary package so I did a

git clone https://github.com/srv/fovis.git

This created
/src/fovis

/fovis

/fovis_ros

Then,

catkin_make

and I got
"The specified source space "/home/blah-blah-my-dirs/src/fovis/src" does not exist"
And indeed, ./fovis/fovis/src does not exist.
Reading here, I see "This stack contains two packages: libfovis and fovis_ros. The former contains a Makefile for downloading and building fovis, the latter contains the ROS wrapper for this library."
I was expecting that doing catkin_make would automagically go get libfovis and build it, but no soap.
Is this a bug, or a feature? :)
Thanks,
Rick
P.S. I also tried

sudo apt-get install libfovis,

and this installed fine, but still didn't help with building fovis_ros.

I have the same problem after install libfovis.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/libfovis/cmake/libfovisConfig.cmake:141 (message):
Project 'fovis_ros' tried to find library 'libfovis'.  The library is
neither a target nor built/installed properly.  Did you compile project
'libfovis'?

Hi Lili,
It's been a while, but if I remember correctly,

pulling the Miquel's latest libfovis drop as of May 11 (see below), and
building libfovis in the top level of my ROS workspace fixed my problem.

Thanks a lot! It has been successfully compiled! :)

Hi Rick,
could you please try putting ros-hydro-libfovis? If that does not work try instead downloading libfovis in your ws from https://github.com/srv/libfovis
There may be something wrong with the debian package.
Can you please tell me which ROS distro are you using?

Miquel, I'm using hydro on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I installed ros-hydro-libfovis but fovis_ros still didn't find libfovis. I then downloaded the libfovis source to my ws as you suggested, and this fixed the problem. Next issue: compiling mono_depth_odometer.cpp fails, unable to find fovis_ros/FovisInfo.h

Also: thanks!

I added a message generation dependency to fovis_ros. Please update your package -> git pull. Good catch!

That did the trick, thanks!
