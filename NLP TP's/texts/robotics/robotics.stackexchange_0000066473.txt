Q:

Keep running the function without restarting it?

I have this problem that i cannot make run my while(true) without it get restarted..
I think the problem occurs since
in my main loop
int main
{
    ros::init(argc,argv, "loop");
    loop();
    ros::spin();
}

In side loop()
void loop()
{
   
   cout << "Are you ready" << endl;
   while(ready == false
  {

      //DO SOMETHING 
     ros::spinOnce() //needed since i read from a subscriber in this while loop
  }

 cout << "i am out" << endl;
 while(true)
 {
 //do something again
     ros::spinOnce();
  }

}

Right now it keep printing "are you ready", the idea was it should print it once.. I don't understand how it comes outside the loop.. it seems impossible to do..

A:

This code snippet should not produce the output you describe.
Maybe you omitted the line which causes your problem. Can you post a more complete code? (e.g. in the line while(ready == false a bracket is missing)
