Q:

Kinect precision curves for 2 Kinects in the wiki?

http://wiki.ros.org/openni_kinect/kinect_accuracy
In the first graph there is a second pair of curves labeled "2 Kinects". What does it represent? I am interested in checking/reproducing these values with several sensor systems.
Thanks for enlighting me!

A:

I'm fairly certain that they are referring to a situation where 2 Kinects are both looking at the plane at the same time. The projected patterns from the Kinects interfere with each other, and the data obtained from either Kinect is likely to be noisier. Here is a PDF of a presentation discussing the issue, and some possible remedies. Specifically, see page 20 for examples of a scene with multiple Kinects interfering. Microsoft published a paper on the Shake ‘n’ Sense, a very cool technique for helping to eliminate the interference. Here's a demo video.
