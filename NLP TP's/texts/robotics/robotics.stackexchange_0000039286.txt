Q:

Flickering kinect camera image using OpenNI

Hi,
I have been running an OpenNI Kinect node for approximate two hours and noticed that the camera image started to flicker, resulting in a pointcloud with black points.
When looking on the camera image in Rviz it flickered as I said.
Does anyone else experience this problem and know what it is related to?

Yes, when i have the Kinect running for a longer time (>1 hour), I sometimes experience the same phenomenon. A driver restart solves this iirc. Nevertheless could this be quite frustrating when doing some long-term exploration/mapping...

I had same phenomenon  too, when I launch openni.launch for Kinect which is in openni_launch after some minuties(20~30minutes). Is this solved?

A:

Sounds like a bug. Are you running openni or openni_kinect?

The openni package is deprecated, so try openni_kinect instead.

If you already use openni_kinect, open a defect ticket. Although the defect may be in hardware, the driver might be able to perform some recovery action (assuming we can reproduce the problem).
