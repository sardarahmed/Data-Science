Q:

Why is HierarchicalArray2D used in openslam_gmapping?

openslam_gmapping uses HierarchicalArrary2D to store the map. HierarchicalArray2D is something like a 2D array, and each cell of it is a 2D array again.
So if a map's size is 256 * 256, size of HierarchicalArray2D is 8 * 8, and each cell of it is a 32 * 32 2D array.
I'm a bit confused about the data structure above, why don't we use an Array2D directly? Does HierarchicalArray2D has any advantages?
Thanks a lot!

A:

I'm no gmapping developer, but there are two advantages to the approach that immediately come to mind:

When resizing (especially extending) the map, already existing submaps do not have to be touched. For a continuous map, this would be different and generally requires a complete map rewrite.
Spatially neighboring cells are close to each other in memory. This can be advantageous due to fewer cache misses when accessing the map.
