Q:

Local Localisation with particle filter

I am doing Local Localisation with sonar, particle filter (i.e all particles are initially with robot pose).
I have grip map of environment. When I execute algorithm in environment (where doors are closed/open), particles are not able to followup the robot.
I don't have random particles since I know the initial position of the robot exactly.
Adding random particle will change the pose of robot (i am find median of particles as robot pose).
Any idea/methods how to improve local localisation?
I want to know, do I need random variable if I am doing local localisation? And how do I improve localisation if there are many changes in the map without adding random particles?

A:

Of course adding random particles will change the pose of the robot. That's the point: To add randomness to account for errors you can't compute yourself. You should add random particles every time the state of the robot may change, then adjust the weight of the particles based on which seem likely given sensor data.
This is a very basic definition of particle filters. I suggest you roll up your sleeves and do some more research on the subject.
