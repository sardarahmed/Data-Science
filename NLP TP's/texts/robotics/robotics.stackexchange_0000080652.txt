Q:

Use of CSI-2 Based cameras on Jetson TX-2 for mapping

Hi all,
Im planning to develop a platform with Nvidia Tx-2 and 5 cameras. I'm trying to choose a camera and 'm really confused. I was thinking of choosing CSI-2 cameras as TX-2 has 6 CSI-2 ports, but I wasn't sure how hard it is going to be to integrate the CSI-2 camera on to ROS. Or should I stick with USB cameras and get a carrier board with USB hub on it. Any suggestions and help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks

A:

6 MIPI CSI-2 Cameras support for Jetson TX1 from e-con systems may suit your purpose. The latest release supports 6 CSI- 2 cameras with TX2 also.
