Q:

Add orocos libraries to ROS project

Hello. I have a problem with adding libraries, orocos components to ROS project. In CMakeLists.txt I add line:
include_directories(/home/user/my_lib_orocos)

But I still can't add any library from that folder to .cpp files, compiler doesn't see it. In addition, these folder isn't in the same path as my ROS project.

are they custom libraries or orocos libraries such as bfl or kdl ? Which ros distro are you using ?

A:

Hello Roboticus,
I have added these lines for a ros project using the LabJack U3 Modul. It also has a separate library.

#directory where the library file is in
link_directories(/home/thomas/projects/labjack/exodrive/liblabjackusb)
#add the cpp files of your project
rosbuild_add_executable(labjack src/LabJack.cpp src/... some more files ...)
#link the library to the project (name of lib file: liblabjackusb.so.2.5.2
target_link_libraries (labjack labjackusb)

As you can see the library is written without the pre-string "lib" and without the version number and type at the end. So the filename "liblabjackusb.so.2.5.2" will become -> "labjackusb".
The command you used: include_directories(/home/user/my_lib_orocos) is more or less to describe where the header files are.
Hope this helps you with your problem.
Best regards,
zumili
