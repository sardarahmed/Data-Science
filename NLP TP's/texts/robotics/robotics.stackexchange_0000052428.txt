Q:

generate_messages fails with ros_comm

While installing with source, I've started seeing this error after synching ros_comm src to the latest commit (not sure if the error starts happening since this particular commit or earlier).
So far I only see this error while building either/both rqt_common_plugins or/and rqt_robot_plugins metapkgs, particularly with the packages rqt_image_view, raqt_rviz where neither of them use the target mentioned in the error message.
The error doesn't happen when I switch ros_comm to binary (1.9.46-0quantal-20130625-1625-+0000).

What can be wrong? Thank you!

Update-1) I see a similar error with different combination, which I've found a workaround for but don't understand yet.

Invoking "cmake" failed

Workaround for this is to have the source of rviz in workspace. rviz is both build_ and run_ depended by rqt_rviz. I've removed rqt_rviz binary.

Your examples and descriptions of what you have in your workspace are incomplete and do not contain enough information to reproduce the issue. Please state which repos you have in your workspace, which versions and the executed commands including their full output.

A:

I just had this issue, and I'm not exactly sure what caused it, but I noticed that some of my workspace source folders were on the hydro-devel branch and some on groovy-devel. Make sure you have the correct branches.
