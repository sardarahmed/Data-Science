Q:

why there are < std_msgs::String> in function name

In the tutorial Writing Publisher Subscriber there is ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000); . 
What I know is that an identifier cant have special characters other than underscore.Then what does this < std_msgs::String > stand here for?

A:

This is a C++ template argument; the nodehandle advertise function is templated on the topic type, because it can't be inferred from the other function arguments. (Contrast this to the subscribe function, which is also templated, but which can infer the topic type from the type of the callback function)
There's a good wkikipedia article about C++ templates, and they should also be covered in any good class on C++.
