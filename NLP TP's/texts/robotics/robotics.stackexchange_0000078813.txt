Q:

"rosbag play" pauses while it shouldn't

Are these expected behavior of rosbag?
Behavior-1
$ wget http://download.ros.org/data/rosbag/clock_alive.bag
$ rosbag info clock_alive.bag 
path:         clock_alive.bag
version:      2.0

$ rosbag play -l --clock clock_alive.bag 
[RUNNING]  Bag Time: 1433334474.755216   Duration: 2.453124 / 39.990000

The time elapses as expected. Then on another terminal,
$ rostopic hz /blabla 
subscribed to [/blabla]
WARNING: may be using simulated time
average rate: 0.000
        min: 0.000s max: 0.000s std dev: 0.00000s window: 59

Issues are 1) the topic /blabla is being published throughout the entire bag file as you see the screenshot from rqt_bag below, but rostopic is capturing only occasionally as above, 2) Bag time pauses elapsing. Once rostopic command gets terminated it resumes without jump (i.e. Bag time was paused).
Behavior-2
Then setting false to /use_sim_time,
term-1$ rosbag play clock_alive.bag 
term-2$ rostopic hz /blabla 
subscribed to [/blabla]
average rate: 804.263
        min: 0.001s max: 0.005s std dev: 0.00109s window: 12
average rate: 22.330
        min: 0.001s max: 1.040s std dev: 0.18831s window: 35
average rate: 26.260
        min: 0.001s max: 1.040s std dev: 0.15480s window: 59
average rate: 19.355
        min: 0.001s max: 1.040s std dev: 0.19223s window: 63
average rate: 24.224
        min: 0.001s max: 1.040s std dev: 0.16041s window: 106
average rate: 30.743
        min: 0.001s max: 1.040s std dev: 0.14531s window: 165

This time it looks much like as expected. But still "Bag time" pauses while rostopic runs.
Particularly in my case, I'm writing tests using .bag files so use_sim_time is really in need.

A:

I found a ticket in ros_comm repo where the reported behavior from others look very similar. Might as well keep discussing there.
