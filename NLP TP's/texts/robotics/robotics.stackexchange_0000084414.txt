Q:

ERROR: Gradle 'android_10' project refresh failed

ROS Android
Error:Unsupported method: BaseConfig.getApplicationIdSuffix().
The version of Gradle you connect to does not support that method.
To resolve the problem you can change/upgrade the target version of Gradle you connect to.
Alternatively, you can ignore this exception and read other information from the model.

I am trying to use ROSJava in Android Studio 3.0.1 but following the installation instructions given here leads to this error in Android Studio. Please advise.

A question with only an error message isn't a question.

I have updated the question. Sorry for the incomplete question.

A:

It sounds like you accepted to change the Gradle version when Android Studio prompted if you wanted to do so.
Android Studio will find that there's a new Gradle version when you open a project, and a popup will appear to change it. Don't do it; newer Gradle versions may be incompatible. Just keep using the Gradle wrapper as it is in the projects; this doesn't have to do with Android Studio versions (I'm using 3.x.x and it works).
