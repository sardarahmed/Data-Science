Q:

How to set joint effort limit from systems plugin

Hey all!
I'm new to gazebo, which i really like and is really powerful for my application. However, I find navigating the new API documentations quite challenging. But that may be a topic for another post.
Right now I'm trying to set the effort limits of a continuous joint from the Configure method of my systems plugin. I know the Entity id of the joint. Does anyone have any pointers how to achieve that from here?
And I would even more appreciate some links on how i could have found that myself from the library reference at https://gazebosim.org/docs, such that I can find things like that in the future!
Any help is appreciated!
Regards,
Till

A:

You can use the JointEffortLimitsCmd component.  We don't have tutorials on using each component, but looking at the API reference for the component namespace would be a good place to start in the future.

Do you have any suggestions on how gazebosim.org/docs could be improved so it would be easier to find the API reference?
