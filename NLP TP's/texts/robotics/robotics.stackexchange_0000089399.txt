Q:

wait for service:Service [/gazebo/set_physics_properties] has not been advertised, waiting

When I am trying to launch the my_world.launch I am facing this problem.
Code for my_world.launch is
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<launch>
 <arg name="debug" default="false" />
 <arg name="gui" default="false" />
 <arg name="pause" default="true" />
 <arg name="world" default="$(find my_gazebo)/world/empty_world.world" />
 <include file = "$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
  <arg name="world_name" value="$(arg world)" />
  <arg name="debug" value="$(arg debug)" />
  <arg name="gui" value="$(arg gui)" />
  <arg name="paused" value="$(arg pause)" />
  <arg name="use_sim_time" value="true" />

 </include>

</launch>

empty_world.world code is here:
 <?xml version="1.0" ?>
    <sdf version="1.6">
      <world name="default">
       <include>
         <uri>model://sun</uri>
       </include>
       <include>
         <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
       </include>
      </world>
    </sdf>

  

I am facing this problem:

A:

Can you copy and paste the terminal output instead of a screenshot please ? It's not searchable like that.
For your issue, you launch Gazebo with pause set to true so you son't start the service, this will start it :
roslaunch my_gazebo my_world.launch pause:=false

The proper solution is to modify this value in your launch file. Moreover you tried with verbose :=true, yet you didn't defined the arg verbose in your launch file so it's basically doing nothing.
Finally I don't know if you are aware of it but you also set gui to false so you won't have the Gazebo GUI with your launch file, set it to true in your launch file to launch it or simply type the command $gzclient after your roslaunch.

Thank you Mr.Delb. Your answer is worked for me. Basically I don't have much idea about this I am trying to launch my robot(mobile robot that created in gazebo) in gazebo with roslaunch and also I want to control it by teleop_keys. Any suggestions regarding arguments?

Good, you can mark the answer as correct too please.
For your question you can create a new one if you have an issue but I would suggest to look at this gazebo tutorial
