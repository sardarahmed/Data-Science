Q:

Â¿occupancy grid from a laser network system?

Hi,
I'm looking for a way to create a map of a environment in which there are statics lasers and mobile robot with lasers. I found occupancy_grid_utils libraries and costmap_2d package and I think this can help in create a occupancy grid from a single laser topic.
I want to know if there is something in ROS that merge the grids retrieved by the previous process. Also, if someone have any suggestion on how to use occupancy_grid_utils or costmap_2d, please let me know.
Gustavo.

A:

Merging maps is a pain. The costmap_2d is setup to allow multiple sensors as input to a single occupancy grid.
