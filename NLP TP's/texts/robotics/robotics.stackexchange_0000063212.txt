Q:

How to hold the old points in rviz

I was trying to plot points on rviz graph. I was successful in doing that however I could not plot the new points without loosing the old points. I want the graph to populate with newer values every-time (Real tine sensor values plotting). How can I do that ? Also is there any method of plotting except for rviz. I don't want to manually type rosrun rviz rivz all the time.
Thank You.

did you try marker.action = visualization_msgs::Marker::ADD

I did but didnâ€™t work.

A:

For visualization, there's a decay time parameter for most Rviz displays. If you want to do specific aggregation logic, you'll probably need to write a node which does the aggregation logic you want and then sends out the resultant value.
There are lots of domain specific examples such as the laser_assembler
rviz is installed into your path you can just run rviz
