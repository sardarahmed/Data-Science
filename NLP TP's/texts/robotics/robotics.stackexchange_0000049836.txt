Q:

Beginner Tutorial 11- unable to create talker/listener node c++

Hi, i am running ROS on an Ubuntu-VM with groovy and came across following problem.
I just started using ROS and am trying to learn the features by doing the tutorial. (in other words: i am a newbie, please bare with me) However i am not able to create the executable files for the talker.cpp and listener.cpp as described in tutorial 11. I followed every step as described and ran catkin_make but when i try to run the node with:
$rosrun beginner_tutorials talker

i only get:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/faps/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials

i tried to compile the package with rosmake and it successfully builds 23 packages but not the talker.cpp or listener.cpp. Here is the complete response:

I dont want to post the CMakelists.txt, talker.cpp and listener.cpp since i just copied the code from the tutorial.
I also tried to compile and run the python version of the publisher/listener and it works without any problems.
Help would be highly appreciated,since i want to use c++ files later on.

A:

It looks to me like it's trying to compile the "beginner_tutorials" package located in the default ROS install directories:
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> beginner_tutorials [ make ]
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< beginner_tutorials ROS_NOBUILD in package beginner_tutorials No Makefile in package beginner_tutorials

This could happen if you've named your test package the same as the built-in ROS package ("beginner_tutorials") and if rospack finds the default ROS package before your package.
Try running rospack find beginner_tutorials to see which version is returned.  You'd want this to point to your package, not the default ROS package.  Make sure you've set the environment variable $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to include your package directory (or a higher-level directory).  And that this path is set before the default $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  Typically this variable is set in your .bashrc file.
Alternatively, you could just rename your package to be something different than the built-in ROS package (e.g. my_beginner_tutorials).

Probably this is the right answer instead of mine.

Thx for the answers. I have not quite understood why and how but i think this is the solution.
The rospack find beginner_tutorials returned the right package but catkin_make still didn't work.
However: Running catkin_make --force-cmake worked perfectly and compiled the two cpp files.

I think that problem is/was that you did not run catkin_make, but rosmake instead.
Comment by Schluchti on 2013-04-08:
i did run catkin_make before, it just didnt do anything.
