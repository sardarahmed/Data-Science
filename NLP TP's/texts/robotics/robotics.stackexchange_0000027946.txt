Q:

A model in a merged PR missing in the database

Some human models were merged more than an year ago, but today I don't see person_{standing, walking} models on http://models.gazebosim.org. I see e.g. person_standing in source forlder. A few other people sitting next to me are seeing the same and on their Gazebo 2.2.3 on Ubuntu Trusty it's not available even though they have a bunch of other models loaded. Any idea's appreciated.
