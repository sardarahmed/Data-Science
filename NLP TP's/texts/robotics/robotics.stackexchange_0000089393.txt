Q:

ROS2 Custom Messages Not Found

While trying to run my python script, I get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lightring_msgs'. I know the message types are being generated; the package files are in the install directory. Why can't python find the module?
My project layout
/lightring_driver
    /lightring_driver
        <driver files>
        package.xml
        setup.cfg
        setup.py
    /lightring_msgs
        /msg
        CMakeLists.txt
        package.xml
        setup.cfg

How are you building these packages? did you source the setup.bash/setup.bat file after building? Is the location that you installed to on your PYTHONPATH as a result?
Comment by beck on 2018-10-25:
Looks like not sourcing setup.sh (in my case) was the issue. Thank you!

A:

I forgot to source install/setup.sh after building. Thanks @William!
