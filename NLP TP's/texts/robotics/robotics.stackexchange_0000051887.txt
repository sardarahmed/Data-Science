Q:

How to make a callback function for range topic

Hello,
I am subscribing to a range message but am unsure what to do. I need to save the range value as a double into a global array variable. I have:

void front(const sensor_msgs::Range &msg)
{
     data[0] = ???;
}

I am unsure was goes in the ??? obviously. I think it is something like msg->range.size() but I am not sure. Is this correct?
Thanks

A:

According to sensor_msgs/Range.msg, the data is in msg->range. The range is a float32 (a single number).
If you were to use the sensor_msgs/LaserScan.msg instead, the set of ranges would be found in msg->ranges. Then msg->range.size() would have some meaning (since it's a vector).
