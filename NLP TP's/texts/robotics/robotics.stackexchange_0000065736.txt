Q:

roslib.packages is deprecated, what's its successor?

Hi all,
The documentation says roslib.packages is deprecated and lets know that rospkg is the new stable API. However I can't find the equivalent methods in rospkg, what are the new get_pkg_dir(), find_resource() ...?
Thanks

A:

Here's a snippet that uses rospkg instead of roslib to get a package path:
import rospkg
rospack = rospkg.RosPack()
rospack.get_path('beginner_tutorials')

Here's the documentation for the RosPack class http://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rospkg/html/rospkg_packages.html. I'm unaware of a replacement for find_resource()
