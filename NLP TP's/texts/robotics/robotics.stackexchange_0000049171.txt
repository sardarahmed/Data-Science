Q:

SBPL Package Relocation

Hello,
I was wondering where the current sbpl package is located. The link on the sbpl package for fuerte is dead (http://www.ros.org/wiki/sbpl) and the ros-gbp github repository for sbpl has nothing in it (https://github.com/ros-gbp/sbpl-fuerte-release). Also the sbpl github repository linked to from (http://www.sbpl.net/Software) is not a ROS package (https://github.com/sbpl/sbpl).
I am trying to compile and run the sbpl_lattice_planner and I am getting errors saying the sbpl package is not found.
Thanks,
Matt

A:

If it was previously in arm_navigation, then I would check out the new MoveIt package. Specifically, take a look at https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_planners

Thanks. I appears the period got included in your link so it thinks its dead.

For Fuerte I was able to get sbpl to work checking out the dev branch of https://github.com/sbpl/sbpl which is a ros package unlike the master branch.
