Q:

Failed to Fetch While Releasing

Misbehaving Release Binary
W: Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/utopic/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.24 80]

That doesn't seem like my fault! How do I fix it, Masters of the Build Farm™?

A:

Utopic is EOL, Canonical just pulled the debs from the default archive. We'll have to switch to old-releases to keep Utopic building. Though we'll probably turn it off soon too.
