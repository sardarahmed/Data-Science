If you're really just starting out, I recommend you pick up one of the books about ROS. One that I've heard is good for beginners is A Gentle Introduction to ROS. You can buy a copy of Amazon, or download it from the website. Support the author, buy a copy.

If you're more of a video person: try these.

Thanks I will read it.

A:

go to /home/kangr/ros_catkin_ws directory, and catkin_make there

This is the answer.
@donghok4: the error message would seem to tell you this as well: is there a directory src inside your /home/kangr/ros_catkin_ws/src directory?
