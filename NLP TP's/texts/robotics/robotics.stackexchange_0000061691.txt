Q:

Planning-Scene: Is it sufficient to publish to "collision_object"?

Hey guys,
I am trying to add and move some objects to my planning_scene in MoveIt. Since I am currently running into weird errors, I wanted to know if it is correct, when I create my collision_object and publish it to /collision_object OR do I also have to publish it to /planning_scene as a diff?
Thanks in advance,
Rabe
