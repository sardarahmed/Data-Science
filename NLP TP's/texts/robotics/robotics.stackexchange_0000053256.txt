Q:

Cross compile ROS to ARM (OC8 Module)

Hello,
I need to cross compile ROS and, after that, use SLAM.
I have an OC8 Modulee (ARM9) with a embedded linux kernel (www.opencontroller.com/modules.html).
I've read so much about it, including everything about cross compiling in ros.org.
Some idea how can I do that? Really need help.
Regards
