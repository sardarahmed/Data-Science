Q:

Getting position and orientation from RGBDSLAM?

I'm buiding a robot equipped with a kinect sensor that will navigate a room autonomously or based on manually entered waypoints. I'd like to use rgbdslam to map out the environment the robot is in, and since it of course also does localization, I was wondering how to extract the kinects coordinates and orientation from rgbdslam. Any help?

A:

Have you explored the tf tree rgbdslam generates for you?  It seems slam_transform is the localized position of the kinect.
