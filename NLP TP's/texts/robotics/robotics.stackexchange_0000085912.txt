Q:

abnormal exited rosnode still be seen on Master?

Hello, everyone:
I see Master is a xmlRPC server that maintains all the information of all nodes,
but when a node abnormal exited, that node still can be seen on the master ?
How can I check the active status of that node?   Thanks!

yes.
rosnode cleanup is a way to try and rectify such a situation, but it's not entirely without faults. See the linked discussion in #q9521.

How can I check the active status of that node?

I would say the same way rosnode cleanup does it: rosnode_cleanup(). It essentially "pings" (xmlrpc) all nodes it knows about and any node that did not respond are considered dead, and deregistered.

Btw: the various rosnode, rostopic and rosservice Python tools (and libraries) provide a lot of this functionality. Seeing your previous question (#q285515), I would first check those whenever you want to interact with the ROS node graph.
