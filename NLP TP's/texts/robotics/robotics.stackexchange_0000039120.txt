A:

I am running VMware Player 4 with a virtual machine of Ubuntu 11.10 and have installed openkinect libraries. I can see my Kinect and the freenect-glview demo works and displays the RGB depth image and a full color video image side by side. It is tricky to get the Ubuntu to "see" the kinect device however, as Windows 7 grabs it first when it is plugged in. But there is a pulldown in Player ... VirtualMachine-> RemovableDevices-> where the "microsoft xbox nui motor" shows up. If you select it, there is a field that says "Connect(Disconnect from host)". If I select that, it disconnects from the "host" which is Windows 7 and "Connects" to it with Ubuntu. After a few seconds, two other devices show up in this list: "microsoft xbox nui camera" and "microsoft xbox nui audio". Go through the same process to Connect to both of those as well. Once they are all connected, they should show up as little USB drive icons at the bottom of VMware Player as well. After that, the freenect-glview works (at least for me). I am on a 64 bit Dell with 32 bit virtual Ubuntu.
BTW, I tried this same process running Ubuntu in Virtual Box, and never got it to see the Kinect.

Poster's point about VirtualBox is spot on, in my experience: VirtualBox has terrible virtualized USB support.
