Q:

What's happen with my kinect?[img included]

I just downloaded openni_kinect and try to get depth image.
But it looks weird.
Is this right?
Cheers.

A:

Rviz seems to interpret the 16 (or 14?) bit depth as 8 bit gray value. Therefore you have an "overflow" at each 256 depth-steps, causing the value to cycle between black and white several times. I wonder why it's not getting really white, but that could either be the alpha of 0.5 in rviz or a confusion between signed and unsigned char.
Does the pointcloud look normal?

Bingo!  I ran into this as well.  I didn't really want to mess with fixing rviz, so I just used point clouds.
