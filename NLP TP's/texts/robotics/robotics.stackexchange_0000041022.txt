Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Collider usage

I'm capturing point cloud data from a kinect, from which I'd like to build a collision map in order to do planning. It seems the collider package is the appropriate thing to use, but without any documentation, I can't figure out how to get it to work. Has anyone used collider, and give an example of how to use it? I've created a launch file similar to the one here:
http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/collision_octomap.html
As well as a YAML file for specifying the point cloud source. However, when I try to run it, I get the following errors:

[ WARN] [1338577423.133577415]: No multi dof joints specified, including root to world conversion
[ WARN] [1338577423.134981502]: No groups for planning specified in /robot_description_planning/groups
[ WARN] [1338577423.135062448]: Can't do anything without a root transform
[ WARN] [1338577423.139176031]: No default collision operations specified

And the collision_map_out and point_cloud_out topics are not being published. How do I get this to work? It seems like it should be very simple.
EDIT:
Thanks Armin, that works perfectly!

A:

For that use case you can have a look at octomap_server, it should be easier to configure. It will integrate sensor data over time and also publish a collision map.
Collider is pretty geared towards the PR2's stereo sensor and arm_navigation.
