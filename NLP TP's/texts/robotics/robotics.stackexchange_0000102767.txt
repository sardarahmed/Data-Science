Q:

ROS2 Humble API documentation

Hello,
Can anyone point me to the ROS2 Humble API documentation?
I found ROS2 API documentation for past distributions at https://docs.ros2.org, e.g.:
https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/
https://docs.ros2.org/galactic/api/
But there's no such link for Humble.
I found that there's also a "latest", but even that one is outdated wrt the doxygen info in the installed .hpp files (installed from Ubuntu packages):
https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/
Thanks, 
Johan

A:

More or less by chance I found the 'Curated List of common ROS2 packages' (REP 2005), which contains links per package to the ROS Index, and there I found the link to the api documentation.
Turns out that the humble API docs are at http://docs.ros.org/en/humble/p/  as opposed to the previous ROS2 distributions at https://docs.ros2.org.

Yes, I had trouble with this in the past. Now, at least, there's a link to the autogenerated API docs on the Humble, Rolling and Iron API Documentation pages (https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/API-Docs.html, for example):

A raw list of Humble package documentation may be found here .

It's unfortunate that these still don't really seem to show up in search engine queries for the package and API features in question.
There's some discussion here:
