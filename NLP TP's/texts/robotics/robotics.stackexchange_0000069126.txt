A:

My version of TLD for ROS <- I know it's written that I used it under groovy but it's catkinized and from what I remember it should work without problem under indigo.
My version used to do simple 3D Tracking thank to TLD <- I used this version under indigo. If you want to remove the PCL dependency it's pretty easy to do so. Without suppressing the PCL dependices, you can use the 2D version of the tracker by itself by changing the parameter Tracking3D to false.
Another Version of TLD for ROS by Ronan <- Can't talk for him but it's catkinized so it should work on indigo (?)
