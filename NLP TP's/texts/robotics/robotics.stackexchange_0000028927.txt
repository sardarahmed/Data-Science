Q:

Basic question - how to open a file

I've been using gazebo for all of 2 days, and I'm sure this is a basic question, but how do I open a file?
The File menu has Save world, Save world as, Save configuration, Clone world, and Quit.  No "Open."
I was going through a tutorial when Gazebo crashed and exited.  I was saving as I went along.
I have Gazebo version 11.0.0 on Ubuntu 18.
I really did search around before asking!
TIA!

A:

There's no way to load a saved world from the menu, see this issue.
You should load the world at startup by passing the file path to Gazebo, i.e.
gazebo /path/to/world.sdf
