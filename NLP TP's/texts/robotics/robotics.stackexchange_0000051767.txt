Q:

Catkin version of rosbuild_add_roslaunch_check

Is there a catkin version of the rosbuild_add_roslaunch_check?  The catkin migration guide doesn't show one: See here
This is a very good tool for checking that the proper launch dependencies are included.  I think this would still be useful in catkin.
