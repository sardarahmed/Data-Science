Q:

debug an compilation error in ROS

I've wrote the original problem here
I'm not an experienced programmer, especially to such a big framework as ROS. So, in this post, I want to share/learn the process I'm using to debug this compilation.

/pr2_pick_and_place_tutorial/src/simple_pick_n_place_app.cpp:92:26:
error:
‘tabletop_collision_map_processing::TabletopCollisionMapProcessing::Request’
has no member named ‘reset_static_map’

for this unknown-member bug, I:

looked in CodeAPI or SrvAPI
-> even in these 2 sites, I still cannot find where "tabletop_collision_map_processing::TabletopCollisionMapProcessing::Request" is. Is it class member?? or in service's message's header??

looked in Change List. This list did not help in specific changes e.g. "0.4.1 (2011-03-03)
updated for new ompl_ros_interface"

I also used "svn diff old_url new_url" -> result here. It seems there is no change in class member of versions branches/0.4-branch-old2/, branches/0.4-branch-old1/ and the current branches/0.4-branch/ of class/namespace tabletop_collision_map_processing/

Any comments, hints about my debugging? am I lack of something to use these info source for debugging??
Much thanks!!

A:

Based on the naming it is probably a service.  A service is in two parts a request and a response. You should check out the ROS Service Client Tutorials
