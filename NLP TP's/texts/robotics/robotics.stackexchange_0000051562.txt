Q:

PAUSE/STOP the ros subscriber(callback function) and restart it?

According to the tutorial of cv_bridge(here is two lines of code in the tutorial, 1.4 An  example ROS node),
(line 24)image_sub_ = it_.subscribe("in", 1, &ImageConverter::imageCb, this);
(line 61)ros::spin();
Base on this code, the ros::spin() will call the callback function and then always stay in the callback function! So if I want to pause the callback function or subscriber for a while, and then restart it, what should I do ?

A:

That's not how spin works. See the roscpp spinning documentation
If you want to stop receiving data you should unsubscribe and resubscribe to start the flow again.  See the subscriber overview

Thank you ! I try to find the answer in the link of subscriber overview you given. But it seems nothing related to unsubscribe and resubscribe. Then I try like this, the code show in later answer. it will shutdown the subscriber, but I don't know why it doesn't resubscribe.

Also, for a temporary pause that needs to happen fairly quickly, you can send a message to your node causing it to start ignoring the original topic until told to resume operation.

To unsubscribe shutdown the subscriber or destruct it.  And to resubscribe create a new subscriber.
