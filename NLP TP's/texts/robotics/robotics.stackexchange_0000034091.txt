Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: pr2_cockpit

Hi there,
I was wondering if pr2_cockpit is released in electric.
I was trying to use teleop_controllers package but it wasn't there in electric.
Should I stay in diamondback to use it?

A:

The JTTeleop controller is now located in robot_mechanism_controllers and it shows up in the controller manager as robot_mechanism_controllers/JTCartesianController.
