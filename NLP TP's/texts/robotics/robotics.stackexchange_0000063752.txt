Q:

map_server question

Hi,
I'm still new to ROS so I don't know much...
but I was wondering where do you guys usually get the map from for the map_server.
Thanks~

A:

You can either use an existing map or create your own.
For creating a new map, you can use gmapping
For existing maps, you can find some examples here .
A map is defined by an image file where black means obstacle and white means free (depending on some threshold on pixel intensity) and by a .YAML file where map resolution, origin and some thresholds are defined. More information on the map_server page.
