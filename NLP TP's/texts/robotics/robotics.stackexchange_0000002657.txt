Q:

Could piezoelectric sensors be crushed?

I have found some load sensors (piezoelectric) that measure relatively small weights (on the order of ~ grams). That's what I need!
However...
Around my robot, there will occasionally be bursts of extremely high pressure. These bursts do not need to be measured... they just wash over.
The pressure appears, to the sensor, to be a ~ 2,000+ kg 
Question:
Are these sensors likely to break or fatigue? I realize piezos do not measure via deformation, but still... that's a big load!
Maybe I should just order a few and try...

A:

This really depends on the sensor. There are sensors which are protected for heigher loads. Usually around 300%-1500% of the rated load for sensors in gram range. 
Most manufacturers say, connect the sensor when you are installing it so you can monitor it live so you won't break it. 
I'd recommend to check the datasheet of your sensor. This should specify overload. I'd also think of something to prevent your sensor from such high loads.
