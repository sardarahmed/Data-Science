Q:

having trouble launching a launch file from another launch file

Dear all,
I’ve created a catkin workspace and so far it includes one package. This package has a cpp file as a node which uses API function from other package (youbot APIs).  So far it has worked well and it can drive my robot (Kuka youbot).
Now I want to call a launch file of other package (e.g. Kinect Xbox) from the launch of the pack I have already created. To do this I did following steps:
1-  I created a catkin workspace named youbot_kinect_test which includes ‘build’, ‘devel’,’src’.
2-  In ‘src’ there is the first package named ’ main_node’ including main.cpp, package.xml, Cmakelists.txt and Launch folder.
3-  In the launch folder I put a launch file which includes another launch file(the Kinect launch file) as follow:
'

'
But my problem is that when I run roslaunch main_node Kinect_test.launch I receive this error:
while processing /opt/ros/hydro/share/freenect_launch/opt/ros/hydro/share/freenect_launch/freenect.launch:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/hydro/share/freenect_launch/opt/ros/hydro/share/freenect_launch/freenect.launch'
Now my question is that is it possible to call a launch file from another? Do I have to change and edit the package.xml? Is it correct to put the launch file in the main_node package?

A:

I believe is should be like <include file="$(find freenect_launch)/launch/freenect.launch"/>

Many thanks. My problem is solved but would you please explain why? Why mine was not correct? Is it because the command 'find' has already included " freenect_launch" package and there is no need for writing whole directory?

If you do roscd freenect_launch it will take you to /opt/ros/<distro>/share that is basically what $(find freenect_launch) does thus you do not need to include it.  Once in the correct directory, you need to advance to launch and then the file.launch.

Thanks. I got it.
