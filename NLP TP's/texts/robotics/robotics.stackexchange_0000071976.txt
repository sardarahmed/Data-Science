Please clarify: a package installed on Ubuntu/Debian using apt-get, a package built from sources in a catkin workspace, something else ..

A:

If by completely deleting you mean "removing a repo and not making it reappear after wstool update" I don't think so. We've been using a small script that first removes a repo from a workspace and then deletes the folder afterwards: rm_from_workspace.sh (It's pretty simple, there might be nicer solutions out there).
If you really just want to get rid of a package you just have to remove the corresponding folder and that's it.
