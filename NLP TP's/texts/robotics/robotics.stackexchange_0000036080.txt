Q:

Error while installing ROS on Ubuntu Oneiric

Hello..
I get the following error after running the command:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full
Error is:
Reading package lists... Done ( I know this is not error)
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-electric-desktop-full (the PROBLEM!!)
Plz. help me out.
I don't get it how to re-index it to ROS.org server..isn't MAIN server sufficient?
Regards,
dbs

Two questions (1) have you followed the installation instructions for sources.list? (2) Have you also run "sudo apt-get update"?

A:

Maybe a little bit late: You have to add the ROS repository to the sources first. See: http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu#electric.2BAC8-Installation.2BAC8-Sources.Configure_your_Ubuntu_repositories
