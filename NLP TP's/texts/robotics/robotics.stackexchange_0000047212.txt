Q:

How to prevent launch shutdown on single remote connection failure? (required="true" not working)

I have a launch set up that includes two separate other launch files which are run on other machines. Those launch files have nodes with attribute required="true" set however, the first node fails to start because of a failed ssh connection and the second is never attempted as the launch file exits on the first failure.
I suspect that the required="true" doesn't take effect as the remote ssh connection fails before hand, but the machine and include tags don't have a required="true" option.
Is there a way to prevent a remote machine launch failure from killing the entire launch?

A:

The required=True is for process management.  roslaunch does not have the functionality to continue through a lost link to the remote machine.
It would be a good feature request.  And as a work around if you use openvpn between the machines the connection will persist over a broken link if using the tunnel interface.
