Q:

Cmake debug option

Hellow,
I may have just search really bad but I didn't find this information. I'm used to Makefile but how do I use the otion "-g" and "-Wall" in Cmake with catkin ? I try writing a really dumb program with a memory leak and to run it with valgrind but I have the following
==20197== 4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==20197==    at 0x4C2B1C7: operator new(unsigned long) (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==20197==    by 0x400845: main (in /home/ros/groovy_ws/catkin_ws/devel/lib/stalker/debug)

And so no line numbers...
Thanks a lot !

A:

This will set -g for you:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

I think -Wall is set automatically.
Here are come useful CMake variables: http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables
