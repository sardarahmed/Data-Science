Q:

Has anyone made quadcopter supporting ROS?

I am planning to build a quadcopter using ROS. A real one, NOT A SIMULATION.
I would like to know if there are any existing packages or tutorials that would help me do so.
I want it to be something like mobile robots: like follows config of REP 105 and works when I publish velocity commands on the topic cmd_vel (works with move_base).
Thanks in Advance

A:

There are several ones. Check out http://robots.ros.org/category/aerial/
About your plan to use move_base: This is mainly targeted at 2D Navigation, so I don't think this is the best way to go...
