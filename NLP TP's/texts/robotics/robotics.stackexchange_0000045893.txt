Q:

ROS and Gazebo trouble with an ODElink exception

Hi I'm new to ROS and Gazebo.
I was trying to convert a urdf model across for use in Gazebo. I've realised I need to convert the format into an SDF file version 1.0. (as I want to use a plugin publisher and subscriber to speak to ROS).
I've included this model in a .world file and am launching it from a .launch file based off a tutorial for ros_plugin .launch file
but I'm getting the following exception:
Msg Waiting for master
Msg Connected to gazebo master @ xxx
[ INFO] [1353386461.847382002]: waitForService: Service [/gazebo/set_physics_properties] has not been advertised, waiting...
Msg Waiting for master
Msg Connected to gazebo master @ hxxx
Exception [ODELink.cc:317] Setting custom link base_linkmass to zero!
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'gazebo::common::Exception' ..and so on
Abo
My base_link does have mass should it not? I've commented it out but it doesn't make much difference
Any Help would be appreciated
cheers
Peter
note I had to comment out some of the addresses to the host as the forum wouldn't let me post

A:

Look I should close this. For some reason the model file wasn't parsing correctly, but wasn't throwing any errors. After closing down all my terminals and starting from a clean screen, my launch code started showing the parse errors, which I've been cleaning up.
Unfortunately I don't know the fundamental reason why this was not working correctly other than the model file was not correctly formatted for SDF 1.0.
