Q:

pr2 complete SLAM process

Hello,
I'm currently focusing on the way I can make a PR2 do SLAM in gazebo. I went through navigation stack tutorial, and pr2_2dnav_slam. The latter is quite interesting, but goals are still user-defined. So my question is : Does it exist an application doing autonomous SLAM i.e. making the robot explore his environment and decide which goals to reach to complete the map ?
I think it's doable using the simple_navigation_goals idea, but before spending time on that, I want to be sure I didn't miss something.

A:

There is a exploration stack in Bosch's repo. I haven't tried it, but it should provide the basic functionality that you request. At Team Hector we have our own implementation of the exploration transform algorithm in use, but in the coming weeks I probably won't have time to make it fit for publishing.
