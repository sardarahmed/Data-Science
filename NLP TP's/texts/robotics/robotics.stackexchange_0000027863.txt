Q:

cant export gazebo_model_path

I was following using urdf with gazebo tutorial but as i try to export the path of robot urdf to gazebo path by using command:   export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/home/user/catkin_ws/src/ what i see inside gazebo is just the name of the path but no drop down arrow.

A:

If the path is displayed empty, it means that either the directory really is empty, or the model structure within the path is not recognized by Gazebo. The model structure should be the following:
/home/user/catkin_ws/src/
└── model_name
    ├── model.config
    └── model.sdf
