Q:

Is there any available 3d SLAM except rgbdslam package?

I want to build 3D point cloud in the room.
Because my computer is slow(CPU always 100% and seems work very slow) when running rgbdslam package, I want to try another available package or improve rgbdslam.
What should I do?
Thank you~

A:

The Multiresolution Surfel Map package performs RGB-D-SLAM in real time on a CPU:

Is there a ROS wrapper? Did you get it to work in conjunction with the ROS RGBD-SLAM?

This SLAM needs PCL1.7. How you download PCL1.7? I only can get PCL1.6 from PCL webpage.
