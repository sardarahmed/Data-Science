Q:

How to detect when move_base is executing recovery behaviors

Hi all,
My problem is the following. When a robot is stuck and move_base is not able to find a valid plan I can see on rqt_console the corresponding ERROR and WARN messages:

In this case, there's no path to the goal and move_base starts its recovery behaviors.
My question is: if I want to write a simple subscriber that is able to detect this situation (e.g. so that it can warn somehow the user) to which topic should I listen and how can I intercept this message?
Thanks.

A:

the page about rqt_console has the answer to this "rqt_console is a viewer in the rqt package that displays messages being published to rosout". You would also be able to see this in rqt_graph by deselecting the hide debug box so that nodes that are providing information about the system are visible (nodes considered debug are hidden by default as they involved in introspecting the system, rather than directly contributing to the robots behaviour, so are usually a distraction to what you are trying to see in the graph).
