Q:

cannot create target when using gazebo_ros and tf2

I am trying to compile from source to test fix. But get error. It has to be in my CMakefile or package file. Can someone advise. Below are the files for rrbot_gazebo. There are no pgm is this dir just launch file and a world file.
# http://ros.org/doc/groovy/api/catkin/html/user_guide/supposed.html

project(rrbot_gazebo)
# Load catkin and all dependencies required for this package
# TODO: remove all from COMPONENTS that are not catkin packages.
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS gazebo_ros)

I changed title, hope you don't mind

A:

The bug is in either gazebo_ros, geometry_experimental, or catkin itself, but not in your code.
I mention it here https://github.com/ros/catkin/issues/539
but you might want to create a separate issue, maybe on the gazebo_ros github issue tracker. You need to mention that in order to reproduce, one needs to also place geometry_experimental in the workspace (even though your logs shows it).
One thing you can do until this is fixed is to remove geometry_experimental from your worksapce. Install it via apt_get, or install it in another workspace and chain the workspaces.

Thanks ....not sure how related to gazebo_ros  I am using root package of gazebo_ros_demo which is confusing. I do have a depend on gazebo_ros but I have depends on other packages as well.
Comment by KruseT on 2013-10-24:
You use gazebo_ros in find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS gazebo_ros). This command causes the error message, if you only use find_package(catkin REQUIRED), you should not have errors. However you may need gazebo_ros, depending on what you want to do.
