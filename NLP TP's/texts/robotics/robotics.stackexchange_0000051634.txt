Q:

Problem changing face_recognize package parameter

I follow the procedure in face_recognition wiki page,and successful run the Fserver and Fclient. But It can't recognize my face ,It seem confidence_value set to 0.88 is too high for my camera, so I want to change the parameter.
Since I can't see confidence_value parameter using "rosparam list". I want to know how can I change the confidence_value parameter.
And I notice that in wiki page, parameter name always will has a prefix ～，but face_recognize parameter do not have one. is this make the different.

A:

In face_recognition.cpp, line 60, you can change the confidence value in the source code and compile the package again :-)
