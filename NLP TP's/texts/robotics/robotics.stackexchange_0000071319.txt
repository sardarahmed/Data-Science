Q:

How to install ROS indigo in Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Desktop 64-bit?

I am having problems with installation of Indigo in UBUNTU 14.04.3 LTS Desktop 64 Bit. I followed the installation instructions provided on ROS website. But following problems are occuring.

At step 1.3 when i run following in terminal:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116

following msg is displayed:
Executing: gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --homedir /tmp/tmp.AyKV0NvoaE --no-auto-check-trustdb --trust-model always --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116
gpg: requesting key B01FA116 from hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net
?: pool.sks-keyservers.net: Host not found
gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: Connection timed out
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0

Edit:
Since i m a beginner in Linux environment. I do not know much about the system and its requirements. It is also possible may be I have not configured the repositories properly. Bcoz following command is also not working properly.
sudo apt-get update

When i run it following message is displayed.

Could you try the following: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 0xB01FA116 and report back here?
Comment by sajid on 2016-01-14:
I tried this. It also gives same message.
Comment by Nouman Tahir on 2016-01-14:
seems you are behind some proxy server, else try changing to main fetch server in software sources.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-01-14:
First: you cannot apt-get update until you've set up your keys properly. Second:

Could not resolve 'archive.ubuntu.com'

seems to point to a problem with your network configuration. Are you behind a proxy? Can you browse the internet normally? Can you ping archive.ubuntu.com successfully?

A:

This keyserver is down (look at this keyserver status page). Type instead:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

this was already asked here.

Its not working.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-01-14:
@mmore: from the output @sajid posted, I'd say that there is an issue with his DNS setup. The server(s) might still be down, but the fact that even the wget .. is not succeeding points to other problems.
