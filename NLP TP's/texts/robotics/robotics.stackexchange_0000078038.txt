Q:

Slam Karto problem "No map received"

Hi!!!
I'm using ros indigo and I've installed SLAM_KARTO from github. I'm using this package with the turtlebot simulator in gazebo and rviz but when I opened rviz, the Robot Model and the Laser Scan menu appears in red color and the Map and Costmap menu have the message "No Map Received". So, I've changed the "Fixed Frame" from map to base_footprint and the Robot Model and the Laser Scan are solved but, the Map and Costmap are still with the message "No Map Received". I hope that you can help me.
Thanks in advance!!!

Hello!I have this problem too recently.Did you solve the problem?Thank you!

A:

What I did and fixed my problem was to comment out the remap line and change the "odom_frame" 's param value to "odom" in the karto_slam.launch file
