Q:

Selecting joints by mouse click in gazebo

I'm pretty new to ROS/gazebo and I need to select a joint with mouse click in gazebo (to let the user set its position or drag the joint to specific location by inverse kinematics). Is there any API to interpret 2D location of mouse click to 3D coordinate of world?

A:

You can do this via rviz: a good place to start could be to look at how it's done for the PR2 teleop via interactive markers: pr2_marker_control
