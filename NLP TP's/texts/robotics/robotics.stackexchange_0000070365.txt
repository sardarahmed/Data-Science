Q:

Calibrating IMUs

Dear Ros Community,
I now have 3 IMUs installed on my Clearpath Husky. The IMUs are a Microstrain 3DM-GX2, a Microstrain 3DM-GX3, and a Microstrain 3DM-GX4. The 3DM-GX2 and 3DM-GX3 both use the 3DM-GX2 node: http://wiki.ros.org/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu
The 3DM-GX4 uses its namesake node, found here: https://github.com/KumarRobotics/imu_3dm_gx4
How do I calibrate the 3DM-GX3 and 3DM-GX4 IMUs? I will need step-by-step instructions as I am very new to working with hardware.

A:

The Husky has an IMU calibration tool in the scripts directory:

You can also hook the IMUs up (while still on the robot) to a laptop running Windows and use Microstrain's own software to do calibration; the calibration parameters are then stored directly on the IMU itself.
