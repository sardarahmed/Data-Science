Q:

Why does my Gazebo GUI look completely different from what I see in the docs?

I want to get started with Gazebo, so I installed Gazebo Garden on Ubuntu 22.04 and opened it alongside a basic tutorial. The GUI I see on my laptop looks completely different from what I see in the docs though. The first two images below are what I see. Below that is what I find in the docs. Are the docs old and am I seeing the new UI? Or what am I doing wrong here?
Also, in the About window I see I've got version 7 Garden. As far as I understand Gazebo Garden is the last version, but I also see versions up to 11, so I don't understand how I can have Garden (the latest stable version) and version 7 (I guess a very old version). What's wrong with that?

From the docs:

A:

Gazebo 11 is a version of old Gazebo, now known as Gazebo-classic. The new Gazebo used to be called Ignition, but due to trademark reasons, it has been renamed back to Gazebo (see https://community.gazebosim.org/t/a-new-era-for-gazebo/1356). The latest version of the new Gazebo collection is Garden and contains the simulator gz-sim v7.x.
