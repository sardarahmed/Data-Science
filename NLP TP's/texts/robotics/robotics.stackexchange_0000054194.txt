Q:

Turtlebot depth image not displaying with Image_view with gazebo

Hey,
I'm using the turtlebot_simulator package to simulate in gazebo.
Ubuntu 13.04 - 32bit
Ros Hydro
Turtlebot-apps v2.2.0
Gazebo v1.9
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image_raw

Using the image_view on the depth image returns a blank gray window. Where as using the same command on the RGB stream works perfectly. Here's a screen shot of whats happening so save myself trying to explain it.

Any ideas why this would occur? The depth data is displayed correctly in rviz.

Rostopic Hz /camera/depth/image_raw
subscribed to [/camera/depth/image_raw]
average rate: 2.609
    min: 0.360s max: 0.420s std dev: 0.02625s window: 4

average rate: 2.769
    min: 0.330s max: 0.420s std dev: 0.02514s window: 10

and
Rostopic info /camera/depth/image_raw
Type: sensor_msgs/Image

Publishers: 
 * /gazebo (http://Thesis-4740111:57881/)

Subscribers: None

After running those commands, the image_view started working on the depth. I guess magic will explain it.
Something must have changed over the last few days.

Thanksfor your info. But using code to deal with the image probelm is too complicated for me. I am learn to create web image viewer and windows image viewer using some manual tools which can be customized by users to help me with the image displaying program. Any good suggestion? Thanks in adcance.

Any hints on how you solved it? I cant see depth/image_raw nor depth_registered/image_raw using image_view. However, depth_registered/image_raw is shown in Rviz but I can't save images directly from there. Depth_image_raw is not publishing (checked with rostopic hz).

Just realised you use simulator. New question, http://answers.ros.org/question/134686/turtlebot-depth-image-not-showing-in-image_view/
