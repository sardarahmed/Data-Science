Q:

Error in $ rosmake rgbdslam with ros-electric

I am using ros-electric. When I build rgbdslam package in ros.
$ rosmake rgbdslam.
I got the error,
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/rgbdslam.dir/src/openni_listener.o: in function OpenNIListener::processNode(Node*):openni_listener.cpp(.text+0x6fd4): error: undefined reference to 'clock_gettime'
Anybody have idea about this?
