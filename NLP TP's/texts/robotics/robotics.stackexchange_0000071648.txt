A:

Moving the controller in the Crazyflie is work in progress in the official firmware. So while it might not work out of the box it is possible to implement a waypoint controller in the Crazyflie.
Though you will still need to send the Crazyflie position using the radio link or install some kind of GPS or Local positioning system to allow the firmware to know its position.
