Q:

Issue to export images from rosbag file

I'm recording images from /camera/image_raw to rosbag file but when I want to extract them I get gray images with little squares like a grid on them:

I tried command line and launch file to record:
rosbag record -O subset /camera/image_raw 

and launch file to extract the images but I get the same thing:
<launch>
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag" args="-d 2 $(find ownpackagereco)/bags/subset.bag"/>
  <node name="extract" pkg="image_view" type="extract_images" respawn="false" output="screen" cwd="ROS_HOME">
    <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_raw"/>
  </node>
</launch>

I can visualize the images from the topic while they're publishing and I can see the RGB image correctly

A:

Have you tried image_saver? It includes an encoding parameter that could allow you to explicitly set it as RGB or BGR.

image_saver works but I want to save all my topics in a bag file, it is more easy and practical

Couldn't image_saver work on a playing bag file? I guess I don't understand the difference between image_saver and extract_images, they seem almost interchangeable to me.

Oh okay I understand, I changed extract_images with image_saver in my launch file. Now it works!

I'm glad it works!
