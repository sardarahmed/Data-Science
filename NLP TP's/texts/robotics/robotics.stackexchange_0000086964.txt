Q:

Advanced tutorial for rospy services?

Please don't link me to the beginner tutorial. This is beyond the provided examples. Let's define MySrv.srv as:
geometry_msgs/Point p
geometry_msgs/Vector3 v
float64 f
bool b
---
bool success

Then I perform the following:
p = Point()
v = Vector3()
req = MySrvRequest(p, v, -1, False)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
rsp = myServiceProxy(req)

I always get the error: DeserializationError cannot deserialize: 'Point' object attribute 'x' is read-only. What am I doing wrong?

A:

I think your service structure is too complex for the calling method described in the tutorials. This question from a while may help solve your problem. You may have to construct the request object beforehand and then call the service.
Hope this helps.

Isn't the OP already doing that? req is an explicitly a priori created request instance.

True, they are. I miss-read that one.
Comment by seanarm on 2018-05-15:
This helped me out still. Switching to the empty MySrvRequest constructor and filling in the attributes via individual assignment worked fine.

Glad you got it working
