Q:

rviz in ROS electric

Hi,
I have recently installed ROS electric and found out that rviz comes with following error:
NODES
  /
    rviz (rviz/rviz)

ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.0.101:11311

core service [/rosout] found
process[rviz-1]: started with pid [2976]

Shutdown errors:

I wonder if anyone knows what is the problem.

I have Ubuntu 10.04, graphics card: nVidia Corporation G92 [GeForce 9800 GT], ros installed from .deb (synaptic). Furthermore, rviz has worked fine in cturtle and diamondback.

To help you, we need a lot more information. What graphics hardware do you have? What OS version? X server settings? ROS installed from binary or source? Etc.?

The same happens to me

A:

We need more information.  Can you please run rviz with the "-l" option to generate an Ogre.log file?  Like:
rosrun rviz rviz -l
This will cause rviz to generate an Ogre.log file.  When the Ogre 3D library has problems, it puts most of its useful output in Ogre.log (but only if you run with -l).
Also, see the rviz troubleshooting page for info on some common issues and a guide to making useful bug reports.
