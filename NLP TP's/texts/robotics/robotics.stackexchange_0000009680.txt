Q:

Getting “rospack package not found error” in ROS

I created a package in catkin workspace and put a publisher.py node inside the src directory of package which worked fine. Then i added another node subscriber.py node and used catkin_make to build. Now when I try to run any of the nodes or find package i am getting above error. Am I missing any step ?
Thanks.

A:

It's hard to tell what's going wrong from just from you describing the error (might be better to paste the message directly..Sounds like a problem with your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. I'm assuming you're following this tutorial)? I remember having had this problem before, so some possible things to try:

You may need to just type in source devel/setup.bash into your terminal.
Make sure your bash.rc file is properly set. Refer to this question. (If I remember correctly, if you don't want to type in source devel/setup.bash every time you open up a new terminal you can edit the bash.rc file.)
Check that your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is right.

Also, try entering rospack find [package_name] into the terminal to find the path to the package.
