Q:

Is there a way to run gzweb in read-only mode?

Hi there.
Is there any way to run gzweb in read-only mode? We are considering to use it for a simulation competition (http://www.robocup-logistics.org/sim-comp), but for visualization only. For this, we'd like to avoid any interference and thus put gzweb into a mode where no modifications are allowed.
Looking briefly through the code I couldn't find much. But it seems the message processing in gzbridge's GazeboInterface.cc might be a place to modify to just ignore change requests, or is there a better/easier way to achieve this?

A:

unfortunately, there is currently no support for read-only mode. You'll probably have to modify GazeboInterface::ProcessMessages and disable code that processes certain incoming messages that results in gzbridge publishing to the gazebo server, e.g. light, factory, model, world control, entity delete topics
