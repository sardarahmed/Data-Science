Q:

Filtering the log files from log directories [~/.ros/log and ~/.ros/logs]

Filtering the log files for one exact session does not seem to be so trivial. There are in fact two of the log directories:

~/.ros/log, which seems to contain one directory per session, but not the node-specific logs
~/.ros/logs, which contains all node and topic-specific logs

Please correct me if I am wrong.
Now, if ~/.ros/logs does contain relevant information, how to FILTER only the logs related to the last session? Thanks in advance!

A:

Generally, logs will be created in ~/.ros/log. Each of the folders in there corresponds to one session. (each time you started a roscore, either manually or with roslaunch) At the start of the session, the path will be displayed which will look something like this:
... logging to /home/USER/.ros/log/ad10d67c-6219-11ea-a8a8-207918a17840/roslaunch-host-2444.log
In this folder, (here ~/.ros/log/ad10d67c-6219-11ea-a8a8-207918a17840) every node will get a file produced by the logging macros in the sources. https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Logging.
But there will also be a floder ~/.ros/log/latest, containing the logs from the last session. It is actually a symlink, you can use it to check, which one was the last session with ls -l ~/.ros/log/latest.

Hi, juste to be as accurate as possible :

logs are stored in $ROS_HOME/log
(default is .ros folder in your home
directory)

if you want to modify    tis path,
set $ROS_LOG_DIR env.    var.

each time you start a new    master,
a new folder is created.    FOlder
name is a UUID randomly    generated.
Not particularly user    friendly...
but ROS also symlink the    current
(or last) logs directory as
$ROS_HOME/log/latest

If you don't see what you want in there, 2 hints :

I can't remember the default, but I
think you have to set output="log"
attribute when declaring your node in
your launchfile

You can set
$ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE and
$ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT env. variables
to match your needs (see 
ros wiki

Thanks @ct2034 and @luchko.
But my issue is still not clear. As I have mentioned there are couple of directories:

${ROS_LOG_DIR}/**log**
 2. ${ROS_LOG_DIR}/logs

While the explanation for /log directory is clear. What the /logs directory contains?

I dont think i have ever seen a ${ROS_LOG_DIR}/logs dir. what does it contain?
Comment by sosoup on 2020-03-10:
A quick look at the $ echo $ROS_LOG_DIR gives me ~/.ros/logs which would mean that this is the default log directory. However, I could see another ~/.ros/log directory along side and that might be because, (as @luchko also mentioned) of the ROS launch attribute for logging, output="log|screen",  if 'log', the stdout/stderr output will be sent to a log file in $ROS_HOME/log. ROS launch node tag.

does this answer your question?
