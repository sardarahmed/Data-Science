Q:

Accepting inputs from a Playstation 3 Controller via USB

Hey everyone! I'm new to ROS and I've been working on a project at university with underwater robotics. I want to implement controlling the robot remotely via a Playstation controller connected to my computer via USB. I'm completely new so I don't know how to get started. Does anyone have any tips on what I should look into?

A:

A new option would be to get a PS4 controller. Currently, these won't work over Bluetooth, but from our testing they are immediately recognized as a joystick by Ubuntu Linux 12.04 when connected over USB. You could then use the standard joy_node (http://wiki.ros.org/joy).
Note that the button mappings appear to be entirely different  from the popular PS3 controller.

Hi fergs, I took a look at this package and I managed to get the input data from the controller as a joystick (which is really all I need), but for some reason I wasn't able to get the tutorials working. What is the best way to translate that information into something I can use to direct the robot?
