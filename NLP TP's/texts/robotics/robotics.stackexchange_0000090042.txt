Q:

ros_canopen reset encoders?

Hello!
Is it possible in ros_canopen somehow (e.g., through service call) to reset the encoder/position values?
I mean:
the robot performs different movements, then
the robot is actuated to a particular pose,
and hereafter i want to make that particular pose the new home (0,0,0,0,0) pose of the robot.
What would be the workaround?
Thanks in advance.
Best regards.

A:

You can reset poses during CANopen homing (e.g. mode 35).
However, there is no service call to trigger homing again (https://github.com/ros-industrial/ros_canopen/issues/227).
