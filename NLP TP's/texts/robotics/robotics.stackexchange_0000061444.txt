A:

See my answer here. Using the Kinect with hector_mapping does not work very well (most of the time) for the reasons stated there.

I basically need a map from kinect so that I can use the map to the navigation stack.
and get the twist data from the navigation stack for my robot to move around.

@Stefan, is it better to work with the R200 camera and Hector_Mapping? Or should I use the GMapping?
