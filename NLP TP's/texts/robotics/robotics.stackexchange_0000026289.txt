Q:

UDP: What is the right transport hint?

In the various tutorials and ROS documentation I have seen the following variants of hinting that
UDP packets should be used. Which is optimal for receiving the current AtlasStates message in DRCSIM?

jointStatesSo.transport_hints = ros::TransportHints().unreliable();
atlasStateSo.transport_hints = ros::TransportHints().reliable().tcpNoDelay(true)
jointStatesSo.transport_hints = ros::TransportHints().unreliable().reliable().tcpNoDelay(true);

On a side note, I am assuming the hand commands and states will switch to UDP as well?
What about IMU packets?
atlas_msgs/AtlasSimInterfaceState? atlas_msgs/AtlasSimInterfaceCommand?
controller_statistics?
clock messages?
Image transport?
stereo proc messages?
laser spindle joint states?
laser scans?
Thanks,
Chris
