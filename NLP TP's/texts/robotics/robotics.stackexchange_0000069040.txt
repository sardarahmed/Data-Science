Q:

Problem connect turtlebot and workstation

Hello,
After I have followed the tutorials , the connection between my turtlebot2 and the workstation still doesn't work,
I have set ROS_MASTER_URI , ROS_HOSTNAME in both the workstation and the turtlebot netbook.
when I'm trying to do :
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
(after I've ssh'd to the turtlebot netbook)
I get these errors:

A:

So I've found a way to make it work,
apprently the problew was in
"  what(): locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid process"
the solution is by :
" export LC_ALL="C" "
in my understanding it means that the code is written in C (language).
if anybody can tell otherwise i will be happy to learn.
