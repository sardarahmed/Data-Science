Q:

Accessing different Kinects with Openni_launch

Hello all,
I was wondering how I can change which kinect the openni_launch openni.launch file selects?
We have two kinects running on our machine and I want my program to use a specific one.
Thanks in advance!
Kind Regards,
Martin

Hi Martin! (it is funny to greet someone with the same name as yourself xD)
openni_launch has a parameter named device_id that allows you to select the kinect that you want to use:
<!-- device_id can have the following formats:
     "B00367707227042B": Use device with given serial number
     "#1"              : Use first device found
     "2@3"             : Use device on USB bus 2, address 3
     "2@0"             : Use first device found on USB bus 2
 -->
<arg name="device_id" default="#1" />

so, for instance, you can do:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch device_id:=whateveryourdeviceidis

I hope this helps

Well... unfortunately the OpenNI driver is known to be not very stable on ROS Fuerte + Ubuntu 12.04. This question might shed some light: http://answers.ros.org/question/33622/openni_launch-not-working-in-fuerte-ubuntu-precise-1204/
