Q:

orocos_toolchain install git issue

I am trying to install hector_slam on Ubuntu Lucid lynx. For installing orocos_toolchain, I am following instructions on roswiki. At a intermediate step, i am getting following error:
dst:desktop:~/robotics/experiments/orocos_toolchain$ git submodule update
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/dst/robotics/experiments/orocos_toolchain/rtt/.git/

Can someone tell me cause of this?
Update1:
I deleted everything. and start a fresh again. But I am still getting following error.

Perhaps it was a transient error? Just checked here and all seems to work.

i had tried thrice over 24 hours!

A:

Edit after updated question:
Besides the fact that you have a problem with git, I can't find the dependency on OROCOS in hector_slam (at least not on its wiki page)?
Also: a deb (binary package) install is not possible? Edit: seems not, as there are (AFAIK) no debs for orocos_toolchain on fuerte yet.

I am sitting behind a proxy but that should not be a problem.

Should not no, but I've seen stranger things happen. The 'Peer closed the TLS connection' bit could point towards your proxy interfering with SSL traffic somehow. As to why the other git clone invocations succeed, no idea. A quick Google search shows more people with similar problems (see here for instance). No solutions that I can find though.
If possible, try without the proxy, to rule out any problems with it.
Alternatively, you could download a zip from gitorious of each of the projects referenced, create the required directory structure by hand and proceed with building.

You might also first try updating your git (since you mention being on Lucid): you can use the Ubuntu Git Maintainers PPA for that.

Please find the update2 in original question. I am sitting behind a proxy but that should not be a problem.
Comment by prince on 2012-07-15:
OROCOS tool chain is required for hector_quadrotor_controller
Comment by ipso on 2012-07-16:
Ok, but your original question stated that you were installing 'hector_slam', not the quadrotor_controller. But what is the status of the problem currently? Have you tried without going through the proxy? What about trying to update git?
