Q:

Displaying a ground image in rviz?

I have an aerial image over an experimental area. What is the best way to show that image on the ground in rviz?

Can u elaborate the question..

Well. Suppose I have an jpg image. How do I display it in the XY plane at X=0. I know that I can build an robot model and doing a mesh that uses the image as a texture and so on. But that seems to me to complicated... Especially since I cannot get mesh files with textures to work.

If it's grayscale, you could send it via an OccupancyGrid message and show it via the Map display.

A:

Unfortunately I haven't seen such a DisplayType yet. Two ideas:

Code it yourself if you stand Qt. Personally I'd try to merge the image-subscribing code from Image-DT into the visualizing code from Map-DT.
If your image is nearly static, the overhead of converting it into a flat point cloud and transferring it might be insignificant. If your graphics can render that.

Well, I kind of like QT but wanted to avoid having to understand the 3D code... The flat point cloud idea seems nice. I think I will test that and see how it looks.
