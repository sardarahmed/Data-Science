Q:

No module named '_tf2'

I am running ROS kinetic and catkin_make works fine. Then several nodes start but two don't start. Error message:
File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tf2_py/init.py", line 37, in 
from _tf2 import *
ImportError: No module named '_tf2'
When I check the environment then I have there also /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Question is what I have to do to make it running? There is no module called '_tf2' that I could install.

A:

_tf2 is a compiled output of tf2_py which is the python wrapper of the core tf2 libray. You should make sure that tf2_py is either installed or built in your workspace and the installation directories are sourced.

Hi, how can I check the tf2_py was properly installed/built/sourced? Thanks a lot!
I was following the steps shown at http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf, but at
roslaunch turtle_tf turtle_tf_demo.launch
I get only one turtle shown and ImportError: No module named '_tf2'.

I have the same problem, but in my case once it is imported with no problem and once imedietly it gives the import error. I have described it here: https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines/issues/920
I'd be glad if anyone had any clue what I could try
