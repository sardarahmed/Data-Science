Q:

Error "Client wants topic A to have B, but our version has C. Dropping connection."

In my custom application using custom message, publisher node show the following message only once on its running console when subscriber starts. Both nodes keep running but it seems nothing occur after that.
error msg:
[ERROR] [1319162712.616980036]: Client [/clientNodeA] wants topic /server_msgs/Swarm 
to have datatype/md5sum [server_msgs/Swarm/6a727e7bfd7e4aadf9d23c4a779b268e], 
but our version has [geometry_msgs/Point/4a842b65f413084dc2b10fb484ea7f17]. 
Dropping connection.

Content of the custom message (/server_msgs/Swarm):
uint32 clockValue
geometry_msgs/Point[] crowds

Publisher node's code .cpp (partial)
Subscriber node's code .cpp
Running environment: Ubuntu 11.04, electric
Thanks!

A:

Your publisher is advertising geomety_msgs/Point (line 15).

@joq thank you. This was my bad careless mistake...

Just to be clear (since this is the first google result for client wants topic to have datatype/md5sum), the error is that the publisher and subscriber on the same topic have differing message types.

I changed my custom message to have header in it. After that I keep getting this error.
[ERROR] [1552465010.096584454, 1550537307.791138420]: Client [/rostopic_21875_1552464987475] wants topic /3d_data to have datatype/md5sum [openpose_ros/PersonDetection_3d/bc1a43439603de5789cfba6300034ed3], but our version has [openpose_ros/PersonDetection_3d/a4ff6437cb65b2eb3d526e8df30d59ce]. Dropping connection.

Make sure sender and receiver have the latest version with the header (maybe both need to pull the latest source and recompile if on different computers), and that they have sourced devel or install setup.bash where the new version was built (restarting a terminal as mentioned below will possibly do that).
