Q:

What is a CIM motor?

I'm trying to make decisions for motors on a robot build. I keep running across CIM Motors. What is a CIM Motor? Where does the designation CIM come from? What does CIM mean?

A:

CCL Industrial Motors according to this thread. So CIM is an acronym for the manufacturer of one of the motors the FIRST guys use. The term seems to have been generalized in that community to mean a big powerful motor in their context. Outside of FIRST/VEX the acronym has no meaning. 
It's a DC motor and from the datasheet it looks like it can output around 300W.
