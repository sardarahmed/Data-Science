Q:

Spawn and kill nodes from nodes/smach

I'm looking for a way to spawn/kill nodes from other running nodes or from smach SMs.
The roslaunch page makes it very clear that the roslaunch API is very unstable, which makes me afraid to use it. I've also found rosspawn tool, but its implementation is reportedly in proof-of-concept state and I see that the commits to it's repository stopped in October 2010.
Is there any recommended way to do this? Is using nodelets instead of regular nodes the best option?

I opened up a new similar thread w/o knowing this conversation was taking place half an year ago...anyways FYI: http://answers.ros.org/question/3225/terminate-launch-other-node-from-code some new ideas there

A:

I used roslaunch.scriptapi a while ago and it was doing its job:

You could also use the default python subprocess.

Ok, I think I'll give it a try. Just to be sure I'm using it properly, is this correct? Create a Node instance -> create a ROSLaunch instance -> start the ROSLaunch instance -> launch the Node instance using ROSLaunch.launch and save the Process returned -> wait -> kill the node using Process.stop()
