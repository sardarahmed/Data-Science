Q:

Random number in launch file

Hi all,
I'm using ROS Indigo with Gazebo to simulate a robot and I would like to spawn my robot at random positions in the world. I use launch files to start the whole simulation. In these launch files the spawning position is initially defined. Therefore I thought it would be best to create a random position in the launch file but since this is all xml, I doubt this is possible. Does anyone have any idea how I can somehow change the spawning position each run? Somehow run an external C++ program that passes a random number to the launch file?
Cheers

A:

You could use a script to generate random ros parameters. Just include something like
<param name="robot_position" command="$(find some_package)/scripts/generate_random_position.py"/>

and the generate_random_position.py just returns a random position.

Great Idea! That way I don't have to alter my normal launch procedure, just put this script before the spawn robot. Thanks FooBar!

Hi @NEngelhard @niall, may I know what are the contents in the "generate_random_position.py" file? Is "robot_position" a 2d vector?
