Q:

Extract 60 fps image from bag file

I have a bag file with a 60 fps camera image stream. I want to extract all the image frames. However, even if I specified _sec_per_frame to a very small value, I still got very low fps image files: there should be ~20k images for my 5min bag file, but now I only get ~2k images.
Here's the launch file I used:
<launch>
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag" args="-d 2 /home/hangchu/MITLL/testTrackLoop_ii_2015-06-26-14-43-04.bag"/>
  <node name="extract" pkg="image_view" type="extract_images" respawn="false" cwd="node">
    <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_raw"/>
    <param name="filename_format" value="/home/hangchu/MITLL/images/frame%06i.jpg"/>
    <param name="_sec_per_frame" value="0.001"/>
  </node>
</launch>

A:

Maybe the problem is in your bag?
please, post the result of the command rosbag info /home/hangchu/MITLL/testTrackLoop_ii_2015-06-26-14-43-04.bag here, it will show how many image messages you have, than you can compare with the result of the extraction.

Thanks buddy! rosbag info shows 20321 image messages, but image_view image extract gave me ~2k images. I solved it with a "--rate 0.05" option when play the bag file.
