Q:

Can Octomap use multiple point clouds as sources?

I have a laser producing a point cloud on topic /laser/points2 and a stereo camera pair producing a point cloud on topic /stereo/points2. The subscribed topics of octomap_server shows that it listens for the topic cloud_in. Currently, I am remapping with
<remap from="cloud_in" to="laser/points2"/>

If I then add
<remap from="cloud_in" to="stereo/points2"/>

then octomap_server only subscribes to /stereo/points2. Is there a way to configure octomap_server to subscribe to multiple point clouds? I realize it will be up to me to make sure that the points in the different point clouds are aligned properly through calibration, /tf, and timing offsets. Thanks.

A:

I would do the remapping the other way around. Make both point clouds publish to the same topic by adding remappings to the sensor nodes.
Alternatively, you can set up a relay using the topic_tools relay. Just relay both point clouds to the same topic and remap octomap's cloud_in topic to it.
