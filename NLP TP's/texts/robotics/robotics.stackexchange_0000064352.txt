Q:

Copying packages to robot

New to ROS here and I've been developing a simple package on my workstation. However, I want to run this package from my robot.
I could manually just copy the appropriate source files and rebuild it on the robot but that seems a little long winded - especially having to do this multiple times when developing.
I feel like I am missing something. What is the 'standard' way of doing this with ROS?

A:

Most software developers use version control software to store all of their source code, which makes it easy to keep the source code synchronized between multiple computers and multiple users.
If you have a particular version control software that you're familiar with, try to use that.
If you're new to software development and version control, I recommend learning about git (version control software) and https://github.com (free hosting for git repositories).

I have used Git a bit before, but it just seems odd that I would have to push changes up just so I can get my files across to the robot? Unsure  if you've used the Player framework before, but it allows you to deploy code from your workstation by passing in the IP address of the robot when launching

I haven't used Player, but I do know that ROS doesn't provide any deployment capabilities.
You can set up your git remotes so that you can pull directly between local machines, without having to go to github.com; this is usually what I do when I don't have an internet connection.
