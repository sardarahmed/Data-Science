Q:

How to install a CAN port on PC (under Ubuntu)

We are using Ethernet as our current control bus and are considering switching to CAN. Our main computing unit is a PC under Ubuntu which needs to be fitted with a CAN port.
Anyone can recommend a PC to CAN hardware interface?
Any insight and experience feedback on using CAN on Ubuntu?

A:

For low cost, but well designed and well supported in linux,  I can recommend the  USB2CAN from 8Devices. 
If you will be booting windows occasionally to set up industrial drives or sensors, or doing real-time,  stick with Peak or Kvasser.
If you will be adding a real-time kernel underneath Linux, check the driver list to confirm support for what you are buying.
CAN under linux with the socketCAN drivers works really nicely.
