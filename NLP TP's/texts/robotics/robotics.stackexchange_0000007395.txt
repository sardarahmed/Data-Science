Q:

Simple wireless connection between two circuits

I'm relatively new to robotics, and I'm building a project for which I need a simple wireless connection between two circuits such that when the first circuit is switched on, the other circuit gets switched on too. I'm looking to preferably build something like this on my own, but I have no idea about wireless connections. I only know basic wired robotics. I also know C++ programming if that helps. Apologies if such a question has already been asked.

A:

If the curcuits are placed stationary the most simplistic solution might be using an IR-Led and a reciever. Like the :

Just powerup the Led. The reciever will recognize this light and switches the output.
