Q:

Timeout form waitFormessage

Hello,
I have a logic like below to read topic
ar_pose::ARMarkersConstPtr msg_mark = ros::topic::waitForMessage<ar_pose::ARMarkers>("ar_pose_marker");
Is there any way to time out waiting period if topic is not being published for a longer time?

A:

You can find this on the API, you can specify a time-out as follow:
 waitForMessage (const std::string &topic, ros::Duration timeout)
