Q:

Connection Timed Out Error during setup keys installation

Hi there! I am new to ROS, and I need a little help here
with installing ROS on my Ubuntu. I am running Ubuntu as a virtual
OS in Windows 7 using VMware Player. Here are some details regarding
the software.
Ubuntu version: Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) 32-bit
ROS version: ROS fuerte
So I followed the step by step procedure for installing fuerte as given here
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu
But when I try to install step number 3 (setup your keys), the connection fails
and I get a "Connection timed out. Could not connect to packages.ros.org" error.
And then it keeps on trying to connect (which may be because of wget command) but
always fails. I am using an Ethernet LAN cable connection for the internet, and the weird part is
that I am connected to the net all the while that I am getting this error. I then
tried the following, which again is never able to complete (Gets stuck at 0%)
sudo apt-get install update
What may possibly be wrong here? Any kind of help is greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
Nishant.

I am so sorry for the small mistake in the post above. What I tried out was
sudo apt-get update
This still didn't work though. The computer hangs up on 0%, until I have to kill the process.

A:

This sounds like a network connectivity issue. You should check that you can reach packages.ros.org
