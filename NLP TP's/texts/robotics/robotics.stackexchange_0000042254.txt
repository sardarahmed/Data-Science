Q:

Changing map_saver map size and resolution?

Hello,
When running 'rosrun map_server map_saver -f my_map' to save a map generated by gmapping, the default size of the map appears to be 4000x4000 pixels and the resolution is 0.05 meters.  I could have sworn there was a way to change these defaults but now I can't find it.  I tried running gmapping with _delta:=0.01 but the map resolution was still 0.05.  Can the resolution and map size be changed during map creation?
Thanks!

patrick

A:

gmapping documents xmin, xmax, delta, etc. to set its map size. That should change the size. If it doesn't it's a bug.

Thanks @dornhege.  I was able to get the parameters to stick using a launch file around gmapping so perhaps I was just messing up trying to put them on the command line.
