Q:

cv_bridge and opencv3

My system is ubuntu14.04, and I am using ros jade and opencv3.2. But my cv_bridge is based on libopencv_highgui.so.2.4.
So when I need to use cv_bridge, I will meet such warning as below:
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libopencv_highgui.so.2.4, needed by /opt/ros/jade/lib/libcv_bridge.so, may conflict with libopencv_highgui.so.3.2
what should i do to make cv_bridge depend on libopencv_highgui.so.3.2?
