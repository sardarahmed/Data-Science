Q:

fuerte packages trying to link with mysqlclient

Trying out the ROS fuerte release, various packages I try to build (e.g. gazebo_plugins) fail due to cmake trying to link with mysqlclient?!
Linking CXX shared library ../lib/libvision_reconfigure.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmysqlclient

AFAIK it shouldn't link with those libraries at all?! How can I find out where the mysql dependency / link flags are introduced?

A:

rospack depends gazebo_plugins

returns list of package dependencies, then running
rospack libs-only-l

on the list via a shell script should show that in this case pcl_ros exports -lmysqlclient
$ rospack libs-only-l pcl_ros
pcl_keypoints pcl_registration pcl_features pcl_segmentation pcl_surface pcl_tracking  pcl_filters pcl_sample_consensus pcl_search pcl_visualization pcl_io pcl_kdtree pcl_octree flann_cpp flann_cpp-gd pcl_common mysqlclient pcl_ros_tf rosbag nodeletlib uuid poco_lite boost_fs_wrapper tinyxml roslib bondcpp message_filters roscpp rostime rosconsole roscpp_serialization xmlrpcpp dynamic_reconfigure_config_init_mutex tf boost_thread-mt BulletDynamics BulletCollision LinearMath sensor_msgs
