Q:

ROSARIA+Arduino

HI, I want to make my robot move using Arduino (with hand made motor controller) and ROS Groovy. The problem is I have no idea to connect ROSARIA to Arduino for this. I have installed ROSARIA and I can toggle I/Os in arduino using ROSArduinoBridge. I planned to use kinect and build a map using it. Can anyone tell me how I should write a code for Arduino to support for ROSARIA? What is cmd_vel?

A:

Hello, is your robot a Pioneer, ActivMedia, MobileRobots or Adept?
If not, do not use rosaria which is dedicated to these robots.
You can use a ros_arduino_bridge or rosserial.
Rosserial is given with sample sketches to start easily:
