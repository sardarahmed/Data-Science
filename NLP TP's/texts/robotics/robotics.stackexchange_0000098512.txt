Hello,
I am also having the same problem. So this kind of question is already answered. check here
The directory of your world files should be something like this mentioned here.
However, if your package have folder structure something like above, you could simply place these two lines of code,
<export>
<gazebo_ros gazebo_model_path="${prefix}/models"/>
<gazebo_ros gazebo_media_path="${prefix}/models"/>
</export>

then you can use in sdf files
<mesh><uri>model://your_mesh.dae</uri></mesh>

I hope this helps
