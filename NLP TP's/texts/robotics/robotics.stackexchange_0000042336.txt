Q:

using ros opencv standalone

Hi,
Is it possible to use the opencv inside the ros package as a standalone tool? For some simple projects I only want to use opencv functions without using any ros functionality. I think that it is not possible to have opencv_ros and standalone opencv distribution together in the same computer so the only option is to be able to use the opencv_ros as a standalone tool.

A:

Since ROS Electric, the stand-alone opencv library is treated as a system dependency, installed like any other library for your Linux distribution. (You didn't say which one you are using.)
So, yes you can use opencv without ROS.
But, you will not be able to use the opencv_bridge interface without ROS.
