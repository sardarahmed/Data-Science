Q:

link corresponding to plugin not part of robot model

I am able to run the multi robot scenario example from the gazebo_plugins ROS pkg (indigo-devel branch) without a problem.
However, in the gui, there is no Model Link corresponding to the camera sensor as I would expect. All other links are shown, just not the plugin link. The camera sensor link is published correctly in ROS.
Looking at the camera.xacro, the pattern (link tags followed by gazebo tags with the same name) seems to be the same as for those links which do show as part of the robot model.
Anything I'm missing?
<link name="${name}">
  <inertial>
    <mass value="1e-5" />
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <inertia ixx="1e-6" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="1e-6" iyz="0" izz="1e-6" />
  </inertial>
  <visual>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 1.57 0"/>
    <geometry>
      <cylinder radius="0.03" length="0.1"/>
    </geometry>
    <material name="grey"/>
  </visual>
  <collision>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 1.57 0"/>
    <geometry>
      <cylinder radius="0.03" length="0.1"/>
    </geometry>
  </collision>
</link>
<gazebo reference="${name}">
  <material value="Gazebo/Grey"/>
</gazebo>

A:

Links that are connected via fixed joints are combined when URDF is converted to SDF. This could cause the camera link to disappear in simulation.

Ok, so assuming I need to get that transform (say, world to camera), do you have a suggested approach? One might be to make the joint not fixed but it seems like there could/should be a better way.

I think the sensor will have a pose tag that you can use to get the sensor transform.
