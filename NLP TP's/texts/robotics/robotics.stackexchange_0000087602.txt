Q:

modify sick lidar parameters on husky_gazebo

I am using ubuntu 14.04 Indigo. I am trying to figure out the best way to add a hokuyo lidar to the husky in gazebo world. So far, from the husky move base demo ( roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch),  It already has a sick_lms1xx laser on it.
Since, I need to mount the hokuyo lidar on the husky for my simulation, I was thinking of just modifying husky_description/urdf/husky.urdf.xacro from this github source, and change the sick_lms1xx laser configuration such as min, max, increment angles to match hokuyo lidar configuration. However, I can't find all these parameters. Dose anyone know how I can modify them?

Which package/node do you use for sick LMS1xx simulation?
Comment by frodyteen on 2018-06-29:
i believe is this package here. it produce a /scan node.

I do not see simulation in there. How is node started in launch file?

I am still new to gabezo and ros, but I think the simulated sick_lms1xx starts the /scan topic in urdf/husky.urdf.xacro file, link.

A:

husky.urdf.xacro is including accessories/sick_lms1xx_mount.urdf.xacro which in turn is including sick_lms1xx.urdf.xacro from the LMS1xx package. There are the parameter you are looking for.
This would obviously be the fastet way to change this.
But you could also use a hokuyo urdf (depending on the actual scanner) and replace the sick one with this...
