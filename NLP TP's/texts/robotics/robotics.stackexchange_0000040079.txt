Q:

qtcreator fuerte and ubuntu 12.04

hello,
I am trying to use qtcreator with fuerte and ubuntu 12.04.
When make rosmake on shell it is all fine!
When i run qtcreator in the shell or out and i try to open the cmakelist.txt.
I get from erro form qtcreator:
[rosbuild] Error from syntax check of hyselam_topo/manifest.xml
CMake Error at /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/private.cmake:78 (message):

Call Stack (most recent call first):
/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:174 (_rosbuild_check_manifest)
CMakeLists.txt:18 (rosbuild_init)
What could be?
