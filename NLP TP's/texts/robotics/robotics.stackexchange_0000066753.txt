Q:

Node dependencies

Hello,
Is there a simple way to create a dependency graph between ROS nodes? I would like to build a graph-like data structure where the presence of an edge between two nodes of the graph (representing ROS nodes) means that one of the nodes subscribes to a topic that the other node publishes, or that one of the nodes requests a service that the other node provides.
Any information on this would be highly appreciated !
Thanks.

A:

Afaik it cannot visualise service dependencies, but rqt_graph should get you at least the pub/sub connections that exist:

For build system level dependencies, see rospack, and in particular rospack depends .. and roseco.
