Q:

turtlebot_teleop: control moving around keys

Hi everyone,
I am going through the tutorials for the turtlebot simulation on Gazebo. I can make the robot move with the command.
I see the on-screen instructions:
Control Your Turtlebot!
---------------------------
Moving around:
   u    i    o
   j    k    l
   m    ,    .

q/z : increase/decrease max speeds by 10%
w/x : increase/decrease only linear speed by 10%
e/c : increase/decrease only angular speed by 10%
space key, k : force stop
anything else : stop smoothly

CTRL-C to quit
I have movements:

u/o, m/. turn around a point,
j/l turn in place,
i/, move forward, backward.

What is the difference between u/o  and m/.? How can I change these movements? For example, add move left, move right.
Thanks

A:

You can see the bindings and change them as you wish in turtlebot_teleop/scripts/turtlebot_teleop_key (see https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/blob/indigo/turtlebot_teleop/scripts/turtlebot_teleop_key#L53)
For example, in binding 'm':(-1,-1), first element is x velocity, second one is angular velocity.
For your question,
'o':(1,-1),
'u':(1,1),

u makes TurleBot move forward and rotate counter clockwise, while o makes it forward and clockwise. Same thing applies for m and . and others.

Note that although you can update the directions commanded to include moving sideways. The wheels are rigidly mounted on the bottom of the vehicle in what's called a differential drive which means it cannot move sideways.
Comment by Akif on 2015-10-27:
Yes, Tully is right for sure. @nampi, you need to change URDF and/or drive plugin to make it a holonomic base.
