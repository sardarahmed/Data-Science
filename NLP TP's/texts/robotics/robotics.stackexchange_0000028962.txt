Q:

Plugins in Gazebo 9 - ROS Melodic

Hello,
I am having trouble using plugins in Gazebo 9.0.0, that came pre-installed with ROS. The specific plugin I'm trying to make work is the Actor Collions plugin (Found here)
I have tried downloading the plugin files, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on the collision of the actor at all.
Is this due to Gazebo not being a source installation, or something else entirely?
Thanks in advance!
EDIT: 
I followed the install tutorial here, to install Gazebo 9.13.   I then downloaded the example files from the OSRF bitckbucket using the 9.13 tag. I put the actor_collisions example folder in a workspace by itself and tried running "gazebo actor_collisions.world" from the terminal. I have tried both with and without using catkin_make to build my workspace first. The result is the actor walking around among the objects, but there's still no collision.

A:

Hi, have you tried running it with the  --verbose flag?
When I follow the steps you linked and run: gazebo ../actor_collisions.world --verbose I get the error that the plugin could not be found:
Failed to load plugin libActorCollisionsPlugin.so: libActorCollisionsPlugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
If this is your case, you might need to set the environment variable, to tell Gazebo where to look for your plugin, something like this: export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:{path_to_your_ws}/actor_collisions/build and run the command again.
