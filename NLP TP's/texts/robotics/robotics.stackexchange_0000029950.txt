Q:

Importing XML to gazebo

Hello. I want to import a CAD model to use it in Gazebo for simulation and control. I used the SimMechanics Link (ver. 3.1) to export it as XML from Solidworks and then tried converting it to Gazebo friendly XML using simmechanics_to_urdf package. However it doesn´t work when I spawn it showing:
GazeboROSNode SpawnModel Failure: input model_xml not Gazebo XML, or cannot be converted to Gazebo XML
I see no modifications in the original file, but I am not very familiar with XML or URDF, so I can´t tell if the convert.py is really getting the work done. Is it supposed to create a new file or modify the old one? How can I be sure that the conversion is taking place?
If anyone can help I will be very thankful.

A:

The simmechanics_to_urdf package will output a URDF file to standard out (if run using the xml option, which I assume you are). You should save this to a separate file and use that as your URDF file. You may want to run it like so...
rosrun simmechanics_to_urdf convert.py YOUR_XML.xml YOUR_CONFIG.yaml xml > YOUR_NEW_URDF.urdf

...and then use YOUR_NEW_URDF.urdf when trying to spawn in Gazebo.
