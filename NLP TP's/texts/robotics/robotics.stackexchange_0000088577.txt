Q:

Trajectory Tracking of URDF/ROS model in Gazebo

Hello,
I have a made a URDF model of a robot and currently spawning it in Gazebo. I have used diff_drive_controller to spawn it. Now, I want to track the model in a particular trajectory. Are there any tutorial available on internet? Can anyone help me regarding this?

With "tracking", do you mean:

keep track of where the robot has been (and draw a line or something similar)
control where the robot should go, using a path with changing positions over time

Hello, With tracking I meant I should be able to control where the robot should go, using a path with changing positions over time.

A:

I meant I should be able to control where the robot should go

the common approach for this would be to first setup the navigation stack. If/when that is working, and you really want to dictate a path (ie: not give a destination and have the robot figure it out by itself) search ROS Answers for Q&A's about how to send a sequence of goals to move_base.
