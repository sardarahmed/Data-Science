Q:

autoware auto avp demo: JoyStick controling lgsvl ego car failed to get reversed

Description
According to lgsvl docs, I changed the ros2bridge from 'websocker-bridge' to 'ros2-lgsvl-bridge' to get better performance.
But I found that the ego car cannot be reversed control through vehicle interface node using the joy node
My joystick is logitech F310, the same as yours.
I want to know if the problem is in the simulator or the vehicle interface.
thanks!
