Q:

Where do I find the ROS Community?

Hi guys,
After a few days checking this site (answers.ros.org) frequently, I've realized that only a few people come here to answer questions and give answers.
In fact, there are questions (including very interesting ones) without any answer too. And most of them, only have 1/2 answers.
It's quite surprising since it seems like many contributors (see the different repositories) are helping in the development of this awesome project.
I'd want to ask you if there is any other place where I can find more activity about ROS. It seems like the community here is not so active :( (maybe because of Summer?)
Thanks for your answers!

To what other communities are you comparing the ROS community to?  While i find that ROS does have a smaller community than, say, the linux kernel, the community here is actually quite strong compared to similar robot frameworks or transport frameworks in general.

A:

There is the ros-users mailing list where you can hear community announcements and other more general discussion:
https://code.ros.org/mailman/listinfo/ros-users
However, questions should be asked right here on answers.ros.org.
