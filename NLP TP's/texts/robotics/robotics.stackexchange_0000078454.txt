Q:

How to build ros1_bridge in ros2 with locally defined messages

The instructions for building ros1_bridge in ros2 says "The bridge will be built with support for any message/service packages that are on your path and have an associated mapping between ROS 1 and ROS 2".
How do I defines this mapping? I want to have support for ROS messages that I have defined myself. But just adding my workspace to the paths (including the basg file as the instructions say) only seem to build for the messages in ROS1 kinetic.

Do you have equivalent message files in both your ROS1 (catkin) and ROS2 (ament) workspaces?

No, I have not. So this is probably why it does not work. I thought that the ROS1 messages would automatically be copied to the ROS2. Now it seems I have to duplicate the definition. I will test with copying them to ROS2.

A:

The answer is that I have to define the messages in ROS2 also. I thought they were automatically generated so that we do not need to have multiple message files. But that was not a correct assumption.
