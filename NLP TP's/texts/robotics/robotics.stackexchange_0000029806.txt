Q:

What packages provide visual odometry?

Is there a package that provides visual odometry aside from vslam? I found visodo but it has a missing/deleted dependency(vop).

A:

We just released our ROS-Wrapper for libviso2, called viso2_ros. It contains nodes for monocular and stereo odometry. Every parameter from libviso2 can be set through ROS. Odometry information is published as nav_msgs/Odometry and geometry_msgs/PoseStamped as well as through a tf for easy visualization through rviz. Have a look at the corresponding ros wiki page for further information.

I strongly encourage the use of viso2_ros. So far, it is the best visual odometry package I have found in ROS.

Stephan,
do you think it is possible to add the option replace=true as a ros parameter to set at running time? Is it even possible to set parameters without changing those in the program? If yes in which way?
Thanks
