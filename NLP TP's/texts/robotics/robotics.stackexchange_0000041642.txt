Q:

Win_ros fuerte broadcasting messages to linux machine

Hi,
I just installed win_ros fuerte.  I have been running electric on windows without any problems.  A linux box acts as the Master and the windows machine broadcasts messages to the linux box.  However, with win_ros fuerte I am unable to get my messages across to the linux box.  Win_ros will run fine with the ROS_MASTER_URI set to the ip address of the linux machine.  Also, when I start broadcasting messages from windows I can see the message name when I type "rostopic list" on both the windows and the linux sides.  However, I can only echo the messages on the windows side.  It seems like there is enough connectivity between the machines to see that a message started, but not enough to actually pass the data.  The same thing happens when windows is the "master".  Ros_wtf just gives an unknown network error.
I realize this is a vague question -- I'm mainly interested in knowing if anyone has successfully talked between windows and linux with win_ros fuerte.
Thanks!
Mark

A:

Looks like it is the usual multi-machine problem. If so, it's not directly related to winros, just make sure you get your ip/hostname settings exported correctly.
Seing as this question comes up often with windows-linux ros connections, I've added some information on the WinRoS FAQ. A direct link to the issue in detail is  here.
