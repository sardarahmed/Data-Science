Q:

rtabmap+camera pose

hi all, i am using rtabmap for mapping and stereo camera pose estimate. i am following tutorials of rtabmap and created map from stereo images that these images save at file (link tutorials: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/wiki/Stereo-mapping#process-a-directory-of-stereo-images-in-ros) but when roslaunch the launch file, from 1035 stereo images, rtabmap give me 44 pose camera. how can set rtabmap that this give me camera pose for per stereo image?

A:

Add "--Rtabmap/CreateIntermediateNodes true" to rtabmap_args. This will add empty nodes in the graph with their pose between nodes used for mapping. You may not have one pose per image if the odometry cannot process as fast as the images are published.
