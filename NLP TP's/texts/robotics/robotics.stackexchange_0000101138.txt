Q:

razor_imu_9dof razor-pub.launch error

I have the Open_Log Artemis IMU DEV-16832
When I run roslaunch razor_imu_9dof razor-pub.launch
I get the error below:
[**INFO] [1643203227.324861]: Flushing first 200 IMU entries...
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/melodic/share/razor_imu_9dof/nodes/imu_node.py", line 220, in
line = bytearray(ser.readline()).decode("utf-8")
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/encodings/utf_8.py", line 16, in decode
return codecs.utf_8_decode(input, errors, True)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xbd in position 0: invalid start byte
[imu_node-2] process has died**

How do I resolve this?

Hi @chm007 please avoid posting in forum and raise issue at the same time: https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/razor_imu_9dof/issues/63

Morning Osliva, are you saying not to post these types of errors here, instead I should open an issue on github? I thought any ROS-package-related errors could be posted here for input from the community's experience.

If you post and raise an issue at the same time you are impacting developer time. Answerers are doing this voluntary and if they spend time looking to resolve your issue to find later it was package related and that you already raised the issue it will be unproductive
Comment by osilva on 2022-01-27:
When you raised an issue it means itâ€™s package specific, therefore the contributors of that package are better suited to resolve
Comment by chm007 on 2022-01-27:
Ah...understood thanks.

A:

Reinstalling the package fixed the issue.
