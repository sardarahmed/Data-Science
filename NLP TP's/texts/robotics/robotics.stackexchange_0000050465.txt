Q:

Can not install rosinstall because of python version conflict

Hello,
I'm having troubles installing ROS fuerte on Ubuntu Lucid. I did the installation accordign to the standard installation instructions for fuerte on lucid.
But when installing rosinstall (sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall) I get an error regarding python versions (>2.7 needed but 2.6.5-0ubuntu1 installed).
I read that with Lucid python 2.6 is the standard version. I do not face any troubles while installing rosdep.
What I'm doing wrong?
Thanks Johannes

Can you post the full apt error (gist.github.com)? It is likely that one of rosinstall's dependencies is now requiring py27.

I'm having the same problem. There isn't much more to the error message. It's:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
python-rosinstall: Depends: python (>= 2.7) but 2.6.5-0ubuntu1 is to be installed
E: Broken packages

A:

There was a bug in the debian generator which created the python 2.7 dependency.  The package now correctly depends on python>=2.6
It is highly recommended not to use the pip version over the apt version.
