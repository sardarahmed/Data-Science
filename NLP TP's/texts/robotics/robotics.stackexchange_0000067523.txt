Q:

Unable to set camera info for calibration

What can be wrong if I get the following error upon camera calibration?
$ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 4x6 --square 0.024 --approximate=0.1 --camera_name=stereo_frame right:=/right/image_raw left:=/left/image_raw right_camera:=/right left_camera:=/left

: (after seemingly successful calibration process)

Unable to set camera info for calibration. Failure message: failed to write to a file.

/tmp/calibrationdata.tar.gz is generated with .png files in it.
On the terminal where stereo camera node is launched, this error prints when I clicked on COMMIT button on the calibration GUI.
[ERROR] Unable to open camera calibration file [/home/rospasta/.ros/camera_info/left.yaml] for writing
[ERROR] Unable to open camera calibration file [/home/rospasta/.ros/camera_info/right.yaml] for writing

rosversion
1.11.10
dpkg -p ros-hydro-camera-calibration | grep Ver
1.11.10-0precise-20150101-0623-+0000

Btw I'm running roslaunch nextage_ros_bridge nextage_ueye_stereo.launch (source) that runs ueye_cam.

A:

The error seems to be caused by camera_calibration_parsers::writeCalibration(, , ), as seen in ueye_cam/src/ueye_cam_nodelet.cpp, UEyeCamNodelet::saveIntrinsicsFile().
I suspect that there is some write-permission issues / out-of-space issues with /home/rospasta/.ros/camera_info/. Please test and confirm.

Thanks. I no longer have an access to the same environment so can't verify but your answer gives a hint. I opened a PR for better error message printing.
