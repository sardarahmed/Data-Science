Q:

Folder struct understanding

Hi,
I am trying to understand the folder struct that's created ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python robot_pkg.
Here is the folder structure
robot_pkg
        ├── package.xml
        ├── resource
        │   └── robot_pkg
        ├── setup.cfg
        ├── setup.py
        ├── test
        │   ├── __pycache__
        │   │   ├── test_copyright.cpython-38-PYTEST.pyc
        │   │   ├── test_flake8.cpython-38-PYTEST.pyc
        │   │   └── test_pep257.cpython-38-PYTEST.pyc
        │   ├── test_copyright.py
        │   ├── test_flake8.py
        │   └── test_pep257.py
        └── robot_pkg
            ├── __init__.py
            ├── mqtt_subscriber.py
            ├── __pycache__
            │   └── __init__.cpython-38.pyc
            └── robot.py

I am more interested in test, resource and __init__.py.
Thanks.

A:

resource/robot_pkg - In order to detect that a package is installed, ROS2 needs to install a marker file. Similar to installing the packages manifest in ROS 1.
You can read more about colcon File System Index Layout there:
https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/blob/master/ament_cmake_core/doc/resource_index.md
test - I put there non-ROS-node specific unit tests, use them like there:
