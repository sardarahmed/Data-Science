Q:

odometry on arduino vs on ROS

I have got an arduino connected to my robot that reads the encoder and controls the motors.
What would be better, calculating odometry on arduino and publishing the odometry message to ROS on my Laptop?
Or publishing the encoder ticks to ROS and publishing the odometry messages after processing from Laptop?

I want to do the same thing too. Could you please share the arduino and python code (ros code) about this topic.

A:

In most cases it's better to count the ticks on the arduino and sending the integrated values over ROS topics.
Counting encoder ticks is something which microcontrollers are quite good at.
