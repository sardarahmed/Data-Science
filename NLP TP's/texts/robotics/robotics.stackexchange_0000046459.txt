Q:

Use android's camera

Hi,
is there a way to get a video stream from an android phone's camera in the pc and publish it as a sensor_msgs/Image message?
Also, is there a package to convert a recorded video file into sensor_msgs/Image messages?
Thanks in advance!

A:

The wiki
doesn't say so, but the project site indicates that android_sensors_driver does what you'd like.
As far as your video question, you could use cv_bridge or ros2opencv.

Thanks! For now I'll just use a recorded video and cv_bridge worked fine.

Now there is a separate app for streaming camera images, https://github.com/chadrockey/android_camera_driver
