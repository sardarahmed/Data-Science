Q:

Using python for automatically writing data in bag to csv file

Hi all,
I want to write python code to automatically analyse a bag file and write the contents to a csv file (to allow for easy plotting afterwards).
So far I can analyse the topics in the bag file, ...
but I still looking for a tool that can automatically tell me how a message looks like (for instance PoseStamped consist of a header and a pose). I know that this information is in the message definition but I did not find an efficient way yet to get it into python.
Of course I also had a look at rxbag, but I did not immediately found what I need.
Can someone give me a hint?
Thanks,
Tinne
