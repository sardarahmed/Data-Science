Q:

New release while ignoring EOL Ubuntu distro

Kind of continuing from a discussion Drop support for Wily.
MoveIt! release for Indigo is stuck at Ubuntu Saucy, which reached the end of life in July 2014.
Is there a way to make a release ignoring a particular EOL Ubuntu distros that are still supported by ROS (e.g. Saucy for Indigo, Wily for Kinetic)?
A potential workaround is suggested but I'm not quite sure what steps exactly need to happen to do that.
I can't agree more that mending for EOL distros is nothing but a waste of time for all involved maintainers as discussed in the same thread...

A:

There has been no update since the referenced discourse discussion. So unfortunately no - at the moment you can't ignore EOL distros when releasing a ROS package.
