Q:

Semantic_point_annotator Parameter Explanation

I've been having some problems with the Semantic Point Annotator, i.e. the thing that removes the ground plane from the PR2's obstacle avoidance system. The main problem is that points in the floor show up as obstacles.
The wiki page does not have much in the way of documentation. Does anyone have insight into how the parameters can be fiddled with to remove this problem?
Edit: Alternatively, you can check out the bag file

A:

That package uses the old, obsolete sensor_msgs/PointCloud message.
There is probably a newer implementation using the Point Cloud Library and the newer sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 message.

That's true, but to my knowledge, it is still what drives the PR2 NavStack (at least up until Electric).

There is an updated version that has PointCloud2. https://kforge.ros.org/pr2navigation/hg/rev/8819c61efbb7
