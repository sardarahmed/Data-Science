Q:

Robot seems to ignore map, using TEB and custom-made map

Hi all, I am running melodic and using the TEB local planner. I am having an issue with my use of a custom-made map. It seems that the robot "ignores" the map boundaries and I am not sure what I am missing.
Currently, I have a move_base.launch file, which loads a global_costmap (global frame=odom and robot_base_frame=base_link), local_costmap (global_frame=odom and robot_base_frame=base_link), costmap_common, and base_local_planner (odom_topic=odom and map_frame=map) and it includes a base_local_planner (TEB) and controller_frequency.
I run a map_server with a simple pgm that is a 240 x 400 map @ 0.010m/cell and I run rviz to visual the robot and custom map.
However, when the robot goes to a position using TEB, the robot_description (the visualization of my robot) goes over the custom map and I'm pretty sure it is just not registering those boundaries.
Any advice or anything I could be missing? Let me know if you need any other info. I tried to attach an image of the rviz but I need more points apparently :P

A:

it could be the case that you didn't register the static map in the config file: local_costmap_params.yaml
please check out this thread for more information. Hope it helps!
