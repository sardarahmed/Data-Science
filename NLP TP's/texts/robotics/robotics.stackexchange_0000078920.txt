Q:

Configure frame IDs for mavros local_position/odom

Hi,
I have a system of 4 UAVs with 4 pixhawks and 4 on-board computers. A ground station is controlling the ROS master. I have a problem managing UAV poses.
Mavros  publishes local_position/odom with child frame ID 'base_link'.
Since I have 4 UAVs operating in the same ROS space, this is a problem.
I looked through the documents but did not see how to set a parameter for child frame ID. Is there such parameter that I have missed?
If there isn't then running a node which listens to the topics (topics are namespaced with /uav1, /uav2 etc) and republish to a new topic with new frame IDs (naive, I know) the best way to approach this?

A:

Did you read http://wiki.ros.org/mavros#mavros.2BAC8-Plugins.local_position ?
You need modified config.yaml for each drone node.
