Q:

Linearize a non linear system

How do I linearize the following system using taylor series expansion:
$\dot x = v cos\theta \\ \dot y = v sin\theta \\ \dot \theta = u$

Here, $\theta$ is the heading direction of my robot, measured counter clockwise with respect to $x$ axis.
$v$ is the linear velocity of the robot,
$u$ is the angular velocity of the robot.

A:

The short answer to this question is that linearization won't work, and here's why:
Differential drive robots can be modeled with unicycle dynamics of the form: $$\dot{z}=\left[\begin{matrix}\dot{x}\\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{\theta} \end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}cos(\theta)&0\\sin(\theta)&0\\0&1\end{matrix}\right] \left[\begin{matrix}v\\\omega\end{matrix}\right],$$ where $x$ and $y$ are Cartesian coordinates of the robot, and $\theta \in (-\pi,\pi]$ is the angle between the heading and the $x$-axis. The input vector $u=\left[v, \omega \right]^T$ consists of linear and angular velocity inputs.
We can re-write this in affine form, such that:
$$\dot{z}=f(z)+g(z)u.$$
Notice that $f(z)=0$, which is equivalent to saying that there is no drift in the system. For clarity, let $\mathbf{g}(z,u)=g(z)u.$ The Jacobian, which is essentially a matrix of truncated Taylor series expansions, is used to linearize nonlinear systems about an equilibrium point, but the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, evaluated at equilibrium, must be nonzero in order for the linearization to hold (there are some important theorems that come into play here, which are covered in linear algebra and linear systems textbooks). The Jacobian for state matrix A of the possible linearized unicycle system is given by: $$A:=D\mathbf{g}(z,u)=\frac{\partial \mathbf{g}(z,u)}{\partial z}=\left[\begin{matrix}\frac{\partial g_1(z,u)}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial g_1(z,u)}{\partial y}&\frac{\partial g_1(z,u)}{\partial \theta}\\\frac{\partial g_2(z,u)}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial g_2(z,u)}{\partial y}&\frac{\partial g_2(z,u)}{\partial \theta}\\\frac{\partial g_3(z,u)}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial g_3(z,u)}{\partial y}&\frac{\partial g_3(z,u)}{\partial \theta}\end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}0&0&-v\text{sin}(\theta)\\0&0&v\text{cos}(\theta)\\0&0&0\end{matrix}\right],$$
where $g_n$ is the $n^{th}$ function of $\mathbf{g}(z,u)$. Each element in the Jacobian is evaluated as follows, using $n=1$ as an example: $$\frac{\partial g_1(z,u)}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial (v cos{\theta})}{\partial x}=0.$$
By inspection, we can see that the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are zero for all $z$, never mind at any equilibrium point, so this system cannot be linearized. Despite not being able to linearize the system, non-linear control of unicycle robots is straightforward and well studied.
