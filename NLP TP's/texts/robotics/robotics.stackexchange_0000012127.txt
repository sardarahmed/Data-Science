Q:

difference between sabertooth motor controller and rc esc?

i am building a rc/robot mower.
most of the youtube videos show the sabertooth motor controllers being used to connect the rc receiver to the dc motors. 
But here in Australia, the sabertooth i need cost about 200 dollars. RC esc sell for about 10 dollars. 
What is the difference between the esc and the sabertooth and can i use an esc instead? 
the specs i have on the motor and battery are 12v 10amp normal, 35amp stall. and my rc is a flysky

A:

i have ended up using 2 RC ESCs they can easily handle the 35 amps and 12v.  the flysky remote also allows mixing so that the 2 motors/escs can handle skid steering on one stick of the remote.  So much cheaper
