Q:

Rotating Hokuyo on the Atlas?

This isn't quite ROS-related, but I figure someone around here would know - from watching the DARPA challenge and the Atlas robot, I am very curious to know what the teams use to rotate the Hokuyo lidar 360 degrees. Anyone know what the mechanism/hardware is? How are they powering/getting the data from a unit that is rotating 360deg?

A:

The hardware is the Carnegie Robotics MultisenseSL sensor head, which has the Hokuyo spinning on a slip ring, allowing for continuous rotation. See also https://support.carnegierobotics.com/forums/22096703-MultiSense-SL-Product-Information for some info.
