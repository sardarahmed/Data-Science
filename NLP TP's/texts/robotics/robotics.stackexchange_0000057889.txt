Q:

rgbd_launch does publish image_rec

In Hydro, I create a launch file with the following to get data from my attached Kinect:
It publishes a lot of stuff but not "/camera/depth_registered/image_rect". This worked fine with Groovy.

A:

Misleading title: should be openni_launch does not publish image_rect.
In Hydro, I create a launch file with the following to get data from my attached Kinect:
<include file="$(find openni_launch)/launch/openni.launch" />"
<node pkg="dynamic_reconfigure" type="dynparam" name="dynparam" args="set_from_parameters /camera/driver">
  <param name="image_mode" value="2" />
  <param name="depth_mode" value="2" /> 
  <param name="depth_registration" value="true" />
  <param name="data_skip" value="5" />
</node>

It publishes a lot of stuff but not "/camera/depth_registered/image_rect". This worked fine with Groovy.
