Q:

Bond vs Software_Watchdog? [ROS2]

From what I can gather, bond (ros2 implementation) and the Safety Working Group's software_watchdog package have similar functionality, in that they allow nodes to "check in" on each other and ensure the nodes are operating as expected by publishing a heartbeat periodically.
I am wondering if someone more familiar with these packages could offer some insight on how they might be different or when you might want to use one vs. the other?

A:

Almost certainly software_watchdog. We use bond in Nav2 because we set that up before software_watchdog or the similar DDS capabilities were exposed in ROS2. I'd be happy to move over to software_watchdog if someone had some cycles to convert us over!

to make it a bit more explicit: software_watchdog can make use of the liveness and heartbeat detection infrastructure supported by DDS. That was not available when bond was created (which is a ROS 1 package, and the ROS 2 version is an almost straight port).
I believe that's what @stevemacenski is implicitly referring to.

That helps clarify, thanks to both of you
