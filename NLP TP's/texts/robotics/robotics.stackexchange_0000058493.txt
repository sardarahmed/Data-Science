Q:

Installing Ubuntu using VMWare Player 5 and then ROS Hydro

I have VMWare Player 5 installed on my Windows 7 laptop. I thought it would be a simple matter of installing Ubuntu in another partition using Player and then adding Hydro Medusa on top of Ubuntu. In trying to follow the ROS instructions I have become confused. Looking at the command line entries makes it seem like a Linux OS should already be installed. It's like the chicken and egg thing. I don't know if I'm approaching this correctly. Can someone get me pointed in the right direction?

A:

You should install Ubuntu first, following Ubuntu's instructions, and once you have a working Ubuntu VM, you can the follow the ROS installation instructions to install ROS in your Ubuntu VM.
It should be noted that the name "Robot Operating System" is a bit misleading, because ROS is not a traditional operating system; it's actually a collection of libraries and communication middleware that can be used on top of an existing operating system.
