Q:

does kinect for windows work on turtlebot?

Hi,
I have been trying to install kinect for windows (kinect4windows) on the turtlebot (and not xbox kinect)xboxkinect
I have been eating out my brains for last 2 days trying the openni driver to work, and still the device is not detected. The kinect is blinking and getting power from the turtlebot sensor board. But after multiple trial I am unable to get it work.
Does anyone has experience of getting it worked on turtlebot? Please reply , else I will have to get a Xbox kinect as a last resort.
PS- Turtlebot page should mention this point to new users.
