Q:

catkin_make problem after several workspace directory

Hi
I have one problem with catkin. When I have just installed ROS I made catkin_ws folder. After it I tried to download source from git and I noticed that with this package from git there is readme file with installation steps. So I made another workspace. I mean I got two workspace:

catkin_ws just after instalation
(there was only one package - beginners tutorial)
tum_simulator_ws
with two packages.

I read here that if we really don't need several workspace we should avoid this situation, because there are some complications.
So I remove catkin_ws, but now I can't use catkin_make.
Please help me.
przemek@przem:~/tum_simulator_ws/src$ catkin_init_workspace 
Creating symlink "/home/przemek/tum_simulator_ws/src/CMakeLists.txt" pointing to "/opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake"
przemek@przem:~/tum_simulator_ws/src$ cd ~/tum_simulator_ws/
przemek@przem:~/tum_simulator_ws$ catkin_make
Base path: /home/przemek/tum_simulator_ws
Source space: /home/przemek/tum_simulator_ws/src
The specified base path "/home/przemek/tum_simulator_ws" contains a CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace
przemek@przem:~/tum_simulator_ws$ 

I use ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04.
In my .bashrc file I have this lines:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/tum_simulator_ws

A:

do this for sourcing .bashrc, i dont know if your sourcing is similar or not, but this is how i did....writing for ur case

source ~/tum_simulator_ws/devel/setup.bash

plus did you reset the terminal for matkin_make in directory, if so,
do a source devel/setup.bash or edit .bashrc like above
