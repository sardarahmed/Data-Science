Q:

Unable to run moveit because of assimp packages

When I try to run roslaunch baxter_moveit_config demo_baxter.launch, I get the error
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/rviz/rviz: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/indigo/lib/libgeometric_shapes.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6Assimp8Importer18SetPropertyIntegerEPKciPb
and it crashes. These are my assimp packages:
$ apt list --installed | grep assimp
assimp-utils/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1]
libassimp-dev/trusty,now 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1 amd64 [installed]
libassimp-doc/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 all [installed,upgradable to: 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1]
libassimp3/trusty,now 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
python-pyassimp/trusty,now 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1 all [installed]

I tried to solve it according to a previous thread but the mentioned solution did not work.
Any help? I feel like I have tried everything that I could but keep going in circles...
EDIT: This is what I did previously:
My assimp libraries were too high, so i reverted them to 3.0 manually (I downloaded the .deb file from launchpad and installed them using dbpk)
$ apt list --installed | grep assimp
assimp-utils/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1]
libassimp-dev/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 amd64 [installed,upgradable to: 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1]
libassimp-doc/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 all [installed,upgradable to: 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1]
libassimp3/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 i386 [installed,upgradable to: 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1]
python-pyassimp/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 all [installed,upgradable to: 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1]

However, once that was done, I would get this error message when starting rviz:
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/rviz/rviz: error while loading shared libraries: libassimp.so.3: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32
since this didnt work, I did a sudo apt-get -f install again and ended up with the 3.2 assimp versions as mentioned above.

libassimp.so.3: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32

and:

libassimp3/trusty,now 3.0~dfsg-2 i386

you have the 32bit pkg on a 64bit system. That is not going to work.

this was my previous error message. so should i manually revert the packages again to version 3.0?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-05-16:
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Comment by ysl208 on 2018-05-16:
my current version is libassimp3/trusty,now 3.2~dfsg-3~urp8+1 amd64 [installed,automatic], what should i do?

I edited my post so that it is a bit more clear. Sorry for the confusion
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-05-17:
Why did you delete the question? That makes little sense to me.
Comment by ysl208 on 2018-05-17:
I didnt delete the question? it's still there, i marked your answer as correct
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-05-17:
The question had the 'deleted' status when I looked at it. I undeleted it. Not sure what happened then. But it's also not important.

A:

The error msg was clear: you cannot use a 32bit library on a 64bit system like that. You could try reverting to the same versions again, but this time install only 64bit packages and see if that works.
No guarantees though.
