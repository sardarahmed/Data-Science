Q:

Problem importing wrl file in a urdf to work with gazebo

We try to import a wrl file in our urdf text..... gazebo spawn the robot, but there is nothing on the GUI. Does anybody know the most probable reason? Thanks in advance for your interest.

Thanks for the help. We converted the .wrl format to .stl and to .dae too. We changed the "mesh" instruction in the .urdf file and the object was successfully spawned in gazebo, though, for both case, we cannot see anything again on the program's GUI. Thanks again for your help...

If it can be an help on the konsole this lines appear:   Warning [parser.cc:332] Gazebo SDF has no gazebo element
Warning [parser.cc:271]parse as sdf version 1.0 failed, trying to parse as old deprecated format
Warning [parser.cc:277]parse as old deprecated world file failed, trying old model format

A:

Gazebo currently supports .STL and .DAE mesh formats (see for example, the COLLADA mesh loader and STL mesh loader in source tree.  If you have recommendations for additional mesh format support, please file a feature request ticket / patch.
Alternatively, you can use mesh utilities such as ivcon to convert your WRL meshes to STL/DAE first.
