Q:

RViz rendering problem

Hi there,
I found RViz did not show an object correctly which comes in front of other further one.
Especially this seems to happen when you see them from a distance.

My environment:
Ubuntu 16.04, Kinectic Kame(installed by ros-kinetic-desktop-full) with Geforce GTX 740
Is there any good way to avoid this issue?
What I can think of is... to modify material properties of markers by inheriting. Will it work?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Can you check the RViz issue tracker to see if this has already been reported? Especially #1067 seems similar.
