Q:

ROS2: Adding parameters to YAML launch file

How do I use a YAML launch file to pass parameters to a node? The tutorial covers passing parameters using a python launch file but not YAML.

A:

I made a working example here.
In dz_launch_examples/launch/yaml_param_passing.launch.yaml I have launch file contents:
launch:
- node:
    pkg: "turtlesim"
    exec: "turtlesim_node"
    name: "sim"
    namespace: "turtlesim_dz"
    param:
      -
        from: $(find-pkg-share dz_launch_examples)/config/turtlesim_custom_params.yaml

and I have a parameter file dz_launch_examples/config/turtlesim_custom_params.yaml with the contents:
/turtlesim_dz/sim:
  ros__parameters:
    background_b: 0
    background_g: 204
    background_r: 255
    use_sim_time: false

This runs a turtlesim node with an orange background color.
I've found that the migration guide from ROS 1 to ROS 2 can be helpful in discovering how to do things in ROS 2 launch.
In working out some of the launch examples here, I've observed that YAML syntax closely mirrors XML examples, even if that results in (in my opinion) a non-obvious syntax for the YAML.
In XML, passing parameters from file in ROS 2 is described here. It uses the from attribute in a <param> tag:
<node pkg="my_package" exec="my_executable" name="my_node" ns="/an_absolute_ns">
   <param from="/path/to/file"/>
</node>

In YAML this becomes:
- node:
    pkg: "my_package"
    exec: "my_executable"
    name: "my_node"
    namespace: "/an_absolute_ns"
    param:
      -
        from: "/path/to/file"
