Q:

Why does rosed not exist in Noetic Windows 10?

I installed ROS Noetic desktop full on windows 10.
I have reached in this chapter of the tutorial but i am stuck because of the reason below:
But the problem is when I call rosed, I get this error
C:\Users\zaina\OneDrive\Dokumenter\ros_ws\noetic_ros_1>rosed
'rosed' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

It says that rosed does not exist in the ROS Noetic directory, which it normally should.

Hi @zain0097
EDIT: Sorry I misread the title first time, revised answer.
The list of ros commands available on ROS on Windows are:
roscd
rosbag
rosclean
rosconsole
roscore
roscreate-pkg
rosdiagnotic
rosgraph
roslaunch
rosmake
rosmaster
rosmsg
rosmsg-proto
rosnode
rospack
rosparam
rosservice
rossrv
rosstack
rostest
rostime
rostopic
rosunit
roswtf

This can be found: opt\ros\noetic\x64\bin
Btw, for other things that have not been ported like rosdep check this link:

rosdep != rosed.

Sorry, yes I misread.

Unfortunately rosed is not included either. To find the list of available equivalent of ros command tools, check this directory: opt\ros\noetic\x64\bin
