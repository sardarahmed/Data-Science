Q:

RTABmap localization error

I recently got this error while localizing with RTABmap:
Memory.cpp:739::update() The working memory is empty and the memory is not incremental (Mem/IncrementalMemory=False), no loop closure can be detected! Please set Mem/IncrementalMemory=true to increase the memory with new images or decrease the STM size (which is 1 including the new one added).
[ WARN] (2019-07-11 17:17:24.941) Rtabmap.cpp:3369::getPaths() path.size()=0!? nearestId=0 ids=1, aborting...
[FATAL] (2019-07-11 17:17:24.947) Rtabmap.cpp:2743::process() Condition (_memory->getSignature(id) != 0) not met! [id=1]

What is the reason behind it and how can I avoid it?

A:

The map is empty and localization mode is enabled. I could not reproduce the fatal error though (on latest version). Make sure a map is previously created and you don't restart rtabmap in localization mode (Mem/IncrementalMemory=false) with "--delete_db_on_start" argument.

@matlabbe so when I do the localization mode, I should make Mem/IncrementalMemory=false ? Also, I am using 0.17 version, I guess the latest one is 0.19? Does it have this version in binary and would you recommend me to upgrading?
Comment by matlabbe on 2019-07-11:
When you go in localization mode, you should have previously created a map. The warning above says that you don't have a map, so you are localizing on nothing. 0.19 is available on melodic, though it is not the problem here.
