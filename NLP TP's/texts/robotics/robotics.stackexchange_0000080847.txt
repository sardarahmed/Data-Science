Q:

Could not obtain transform from /gps to base_link

After rosrun ekf_localization_node and navsat_transform_node, I got warning like this:

A:

This means you probably haven't defined the gps link in your URDF. The gps link should be a link defined on your robot at the location where your GPS is mounted. Make the joint from the gps link to its parent link a fixed joint, and the transform should then be available to navsat_transform_node.

Well, it sounds reasonable, but I don't know how and where to define that. Would you mind showing me the detail ? I'm new to navsat_transform_node, thank you so much!

Just add a link in your URDF file called gps. Will give you the details when I can access a PC in an hour or so.

So nice of you. You mean add context like " gps_frame_id : gps " in ekf_template.yaml?

Add this to your URDF file:
<link name="gps"/>

<joint name="gps_to_base_link" type="fixed">
<parent link="base_link"/>
<child link="gps"/>
<origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
</joint>
