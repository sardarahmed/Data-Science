Q:

rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan not working

I  am using turtlebot 2 with astra pro sensor on ubuntu 14 with ros indigo.
when i run
$rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan image:=camera/depth/image_raw
i get no response or any output window,  whereas i can easily get rgb, ir and depth images using rosrun commands.
can anybody help if there is needed some extra configuration in order to make it work?

A:

depthimage_to_laserscan takes a depth image (sensor_msgs/Image), converts it to a Laserscan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan) and publishes it. No "output window" is created.
By default the LaserScan is published on the /scan topic.
You can check it exists with rostopic list | grep "/scan"
To visualize it, the most common would be to add a LaserScan plugin in RViz and select the /scan topic.

If this doesn't answer your question, can you please edit it to provide more information:

expected?

is it necessary to run rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan command in order to publish laser scan data? or it is by default available when ros astra is running.
and how can i check the values of sensor_msgs/Image? is there any command to get this value? i want to check whether it is receiving data or not?

i have run this command
$rostopic list | grep "/scan" and i got this message "/scan" and when i run command $rostopic echo /scan ,
i get following message

Without any information about what your setup is, what tutorial you are following and what you are trying to accomplish it's hard to tell
Please edit your original question with more information as suggested in the answer above

problem solved. Thanks for all your support.
I have plotted the data received from /scan topic on MATLAB. I am using it for obstacle avoidance and navigation. The main reason that i was not receiving the scan topic data for astra pro 3d sensor is that i was missing the command  $rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan image:=/camera/depth/image_raw for astra.
