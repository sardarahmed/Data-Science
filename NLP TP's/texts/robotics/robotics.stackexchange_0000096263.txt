Q:

roslaunch dies with exit code -11 after it stops receiving topic from bag file

The node behaves as expected while it receives a topic but as soon as the topic playback terminates, an error is thrown and the launch file (node) stops. I also can't find the log file in the mentioned location.
[visualize_ros-1] process has died [pid 23305, exit code -11, cmd /home/sverma/catkin_ws/devel/lib/quanergy/visualize_ros __name:=visualize_ros __log:=/home/sverma/.ros/log/3d1f5648-afc8-11ea-9ecb-d07e35604451/visualize_ros-1.log].
log file: /home/sverma/.ros/log/3d1f5648-afc8-11ea-9ecb-d07e35604451/visualize_ros-1*.log
all processes on machine have died, roslaunch will exit

I'd suggest posting the actual launch file contents - otherwise this is somewhat impossible to debug

As @fergs says, We need more information in order to try to guess what's happening. Maybe at least explaining which data gives the bag file?

<launch>

    <arg name="path"/>

    <node pkg="my_pkg" type="my_node" name="my_node" output="screen">
        <param name="path" value="$(arg path)" />
    </node> 

</launch>

Also, I managed to get the most recent log file (although it was not the same name as mentioned in the console) and it says: error: [Errno 111] Connection refused

A:

I think the error is just a node trying to connect to a service that is already shut down. Are you running the bag and the node in different machines/networks. Have you properly set up the ROS_MASTER_URI/ROS_IP enviromental variables. Check this.
Besides that, exit code -11 means a SIGSEGV that basically means a segmentation fault, maybe in your code you have something that is crashing the excution. Just to be sure you can debug it GDB.
