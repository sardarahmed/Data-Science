Q:

Regarding Kalman filter and estimating heading with magnetic compass

I have trouble estimating the heading when close to the "pivot" point of the compass, and could use some input on how to solve it. I have set up my angles to be from 0-360 degrees during the testing but will be using radians (-pi, pi) from now on.
The setup is a differential robot with IMU, wheel encoders and a magnetic compass. 
A complementary filter is used for fusing gyroZ and odo measurements to estimate the heading, and then correct it with a Kalman filter using the magnetic compass.
My problem occurs when the robot heading is close to -pi/pi .
The estimated heading is useless even though the robot is not even moving.
I am thinking this must be a very common problem and probably has a better solution than what I came up with, which was either re-initializing the integrator when crossing zero, adding 180 degrees each time the error is larger, or just ignoring the compass if the error is too large...
It's my first Kalman filter so I may have made a poor implementation if this is not a common issue...
Edit: trudesagen's solution solved my problem.

I encountered this problem myself when making an extended Kalman filter for a quadrotor.
You have to check if the estimate goes above or below +/- pi, and then correct it if it does.
You can do this with a simple if statement:
if (angle > pi)
    angle = angle - 2*pi;
else if (angle < -pi)
    angle = angle + 2*pi;

You could also throw in a while loop over that, if the value ever becomes larger than 2*pi for some reason, due to spikes etc. This looks like so:
while (abs(angle) > pi) {    
    if (angle > pi)
        angle = angle - 2*pi;
    else if (angle< -pi)
        angle = angle + 2*pi;
}

Remember to have this check after your prediction, as well as on the difference between your measured compass angle and your prediction, that you use to calculate the corrected estimate.
After this you also check the corrected estimate for the same, which should fix your problem.
