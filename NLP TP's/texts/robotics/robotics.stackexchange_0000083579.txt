Q:

How to save the model file in gazebo

Hello, I am a new user of gazebo, and I can't find the way to save models into one file or folder. It seems that the save function only save some kind of log file(.sdf) which connected to the model files inside the local gazebo folder, if I send the file to others, they cannot find the model which only exists in my computer?

This is gazebo related question. In future post this kind of questions on gazebo forum.
Gazebo uses as default .sdf rather than ROS's default .urdf format for models. So your .sdf model is your actual model. Take a look at sdf format here.
