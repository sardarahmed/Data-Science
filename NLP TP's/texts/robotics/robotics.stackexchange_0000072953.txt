A:

Maybe you have more than one NICs. For example, we usually have a Gigabyte Network Card and a Wi-Fi card in one laptop, if they all connect to the networks, ROS will be confused. You'd better add an extra line in you .bashrc file like:export ROS_IP=192.168.1.2 to declare which local IP you want to use. Then your ROS knows which NIC should be used.
