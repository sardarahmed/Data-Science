Q:

Kinect camera with visp auto tracker

Hello,
I'm trying to use the package  "Visp_auto_tracker for detecting QR codes. I plan to use the tracklive_firewire.launch for doing the job. But this launch file uses the firewire camera. Being very new to ROS, i don't know how to replace this with the kinect parameters. I'm very new to ROS so I would be very grateful for expert help.
I already downloaded the kinect 2 drivers.

A:

So I don't know exactly for ROS, but for the native ViSP library it already includes a class for freenect (kinect v1) you can check it here so I have used it to create some applications, for example to track some blobs. Check this repository you can write you own ros node in the same manner, use (tutorial-kinect-sensor.cpp and tutorial-barcode-detector.cpp) to produce what you want then you can write your own launch file or just run it directly.
Hopes this helps,
Cheers!
