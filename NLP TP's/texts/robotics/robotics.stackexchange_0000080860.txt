A:

If I interpret REP-003 correctly, the Lunar section seems to say: Python 2.7 is default, but it'd be nice if your code works on 3.5 as well:

Python 3.5 not required, but testing against it is recommended

No hard guarantees apparently.
I know there has been quite some work getting all the core packages Python 3 compatible though.
