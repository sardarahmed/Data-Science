Q:

resetting turtlebot odometry in simulation

Hi,
Is there a way to reset the odometry in simulation of turtlebot.
When I reset the Gazebo world the data published via topic /odom and /robot_pose_ekf/odom remains unchanged. Probably that is because it is not part of the gazebo.
Is there a way I can reset it.
Edit : I am using electric on Ubuntu 11.10

Please state the ROS distro you are using, e.g. add a tag (fuerte, groovy etc.).

A:

The short answer is no. The current plugin does not allow resetting the odom and robot_pose_ekf data.
However, in Gazebo you could just delete the current turtlebot and create a new one.
Please file a ticket on Github for this missing feature: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/issues
Or even better, implement the necessary changes and make a pull request! :-)

Just a thought, in navigation stack robot is localized in the map. So that must be constantly updating odom of it. How is that done?
