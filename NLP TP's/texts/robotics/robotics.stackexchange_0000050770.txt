Q:

" rostopic list " error

rostopic list throws below error message:
 rostopic list
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/bin/rostopic", line 34, in <module>
    import rostopic
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rostopic/__init__.py", line 58, in <module>
    import rospy

    class RosStreamHandler(rosgraph.roslogging.RosStreamHandler):
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'RosStreamHandler'

This error comes when I am executing this command on workstation computer. But when I run the same on turtlebot computer, it displays published topics.
Anyone please let me know what could be the issue.

Yeah, similar issue. The following packages have been kept back:
ros-groovy-rosgraph . So, installed this package. Thank you !! It resolved my problem.
