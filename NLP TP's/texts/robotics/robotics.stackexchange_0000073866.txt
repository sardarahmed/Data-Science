Q:

why "gtest" in ros giving CMake Error when i compile the code?

i am running a simple gtest, when i compile my package with catkin_make,  i am getting below error. Can anyone help to resolve this?
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/test/gtest.cmake:71 (message):
  catkin_add_executable_with_gtest() must be called after catkin_package() so
  that default output directories for the executables are defined
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/test/gtest.cmake:34 (catkin_add_executable_with_gtest)
  ros_gtest/CMakeLists.txt:26 (catkin_add_gtest)

i followed this link  http://ysonggit.github.io/coding/2014/12/19/use-gtest-in-ros-program.html

A:

The error explains itself reasonably well:

catkin_add_executable_with_gtest() must be called after catkin_package()

In your CMakeLists.txt, you need to call catkin_package() before you call catkin_add_executable_with_gtest().
It looks like the tutorial you're following is missing this step (but it's included in the author's sample repository)
