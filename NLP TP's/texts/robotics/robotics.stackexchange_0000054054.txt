Q:

Groovy vs Fuerte

I have found out one that is in Groovy we have 'package.xml' where as in Fuerte it is ** 'manifest.xml'**

A:

It depends on whether the package has been ported from rosbuild to catkin.  Not all packages were converted.  If you need to convert there's a guide here: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild

A good place to get an overview of the design of catkin see: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview
