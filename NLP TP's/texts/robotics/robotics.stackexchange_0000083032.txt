Q:

Problem with installing ROS indigo Ubuntu 14.04 - ros-indigo-perception

Dear all,
I already installed ROS-indigo once on my Ubuntu 14.04 which was working perfectly but I was obliged to delete ROS-indigo.
Now that I am trying to re-install ROS-indigo it does not accept the full desktop version installation and gives me this error

$ sudo apt-get install
ros-indigo-desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done
Building  dependency tree
Reading state  information... Done
Some packages  could not be installed.
This may mean  that you have requested
an impossible  situation or if you are
using the  unstable distribution that
some required packages have not yet
been  created or been moved out of
Incoming.  The following information
may help to  resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet
dependencies:  ros-indigo-desktop-full
: Depends: ros-indigo-perception but
it is not going to be installed E:
Unable to correct problems, you have
held broken packages.

I searched on the previous answers and nothings works and still it has a problem with the "ros-indigo-perception"
Thanks,
Hamed

I should mention that I tried Synaptic and

$sudo apt-get install -f

In order to fix the broken packages, but still is not working.
