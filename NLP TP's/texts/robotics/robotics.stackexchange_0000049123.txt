Q:

bloom says "Cannot push to remote release repository"

I got this error when I ran bloom-release with a metapackage that I joined maintainer team after it's been already released. Am I missing anything?
----error msg----
$ bloom-release pkg_a groovy
==> Fetching 'pkg_a' repository from
'https://github.com/ros-gbp/pkg_a-release.git'
==> Testing for push permission on release repository
Username for 'https://github.com': my_github_account

fatal: HTTP request failed
Cannot push to remote release repository.

I suspect I don't have a push privilege to the release repository (but tutorials of bloom didn't tell me to ask for a push access).

A:

You must have push access to the release repository in order to release into it.
I thought that went with out saying, but also bloom informs you of it if you lack the required privileges, so I did not put that in the tutorials. Feel free to update them and clarify that if you wish.

After wondering which is a good wiki page to add a note, I added 1 line http://www.ros.org/wiki/bloom/Tutorials/ReleaseCatkinPackage.
