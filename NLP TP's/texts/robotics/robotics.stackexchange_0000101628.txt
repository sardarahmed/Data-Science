Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Pytest in ros2

Hi,
I had never used pytest for ros before. I was looking for some examples of how to set up pytest and use colcon test to test it out. Inside setup.py for the packages I see tests_require = ['pytest'] and also that pkg contains test and resources folder, but not sure how to use it. Some basic examples would be much appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

A:

There's an option in colcon test (ref (colcon.readthedocs.io)):
--python-testing {pytest,setuppy_test}

Note that these are for "pure Python" test cases, i.e. tests that don't involve ROS nodes. For tests with ROS nodes, in ROS1 you can use rostest. In ROS2, #q292100 (started in 2018) indicates there's no equivalent.
