Q:

Using mapviz gpsfix vs navsatfix

Mapviz apparently uses GPSFix.It seems like most GPS nodes are still using NavSatFix which is a subset of the items in GPSFix.

Is there a mapping node between these two message types for Indigo?
In general is everything moving to GPSFix over NavSatFix?
Does mapviz somehow support NavSatFix in Indigo?

A:

I believe Mapviz already supports NavSatFix. Try to compile the most recent version of Mapviz from Source, just to make sure.
If somebody still needs to convert NavSatFix messages to GPSFix (or the other way round), you can use the fix_translator script from the gps_common package (see http://wiki.ros.org/gps_common):
roslaunch gps_common fix_translator.launch

You need to adapt fix_translator.launch to the topic names on your system.
