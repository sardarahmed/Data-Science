Q:

Installation Problem of ROS groovy on Ubuntu 11.10

Hello I am trying to install ROS groovy on ubuntu 11.10 by following the instruction given http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu. When I type in the terminal sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full; then after 16% completion, suddenly following errors come. And after that rosdep command does not work(command not found).

This code block was moved to the following github gist:

A:

This is a generic connectivity issue you have.  It's failing even for pure Ubuntu access.  You are probably behind a proxy or something else which is miss-configured or is possibly throttling you if you get 16% and then fail.
