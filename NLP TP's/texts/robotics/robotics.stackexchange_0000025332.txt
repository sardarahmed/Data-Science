Q:

Importing custom Mesh (DAE) fails due to Buffer Out of Memory

Hello All,
I am trying to create an environment model with a custom COLLADA DAE. The file is around 100MB size. However, Gazebo is unable to import the DAE and gives me this error:
Error [Visual.cc:1668] Unable to insert mesh[Vertex Buffer: Out of memory
I am not sure if it is a Gazebo or OGRE issue. Any suggestions on how to fix this?
Thanks
Ammar

Can you post the collada file online so that I can download it?

Sure. They are at gs6144.sp.cs.cmu.edu/share/Ammar/    The one I was trying was Ground.dae. Thanks!

think I might have seen errors like this before on an old quadro fx 1600m (256MB memory), might be a gpu issue too.

A:

We have verified that this mesh loads using gazebo 1.9 on a laptop, though gazebo is rather slow. Is this still a problem for you? What version of gazebo are you using?
