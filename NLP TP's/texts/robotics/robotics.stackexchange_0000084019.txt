Q:

Eval roslaunch substitution expression from console

Can I do that?
For example
$ roslaunch eval '$(find my_package)/some_file'
/path/to/my/package/some_file

A:

Afaik there is no entrypoint provided for that, but the following oneliner works for me (just an example):
python -c 'import roslaunch; print roslaunch.substitution_args.resolve_args("$(find rospy)")'

This prints:
/opt/ros/lunar/share/rospy

on a Lunar installation.
If you're only interested in finding the locations of packages, then catkin_find_pkg might be an alternative:
catkin_find_pkg rospy /opt/ros
