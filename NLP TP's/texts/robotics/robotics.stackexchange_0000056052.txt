Q:

How to link a common module in more packages?

Hello,
I have some ROS C++ packages that share many common functions.
They are identical functions so I was thinking to put them all in another file.hpp and include this file in each package is needing them.
I'm using catkin to create my workspace and all the packages I develop. They are all in src directory starting from the main one, as the tutorials said.
But where do I must save this file.hpp in the workspace and which path I have to #include in each file that is using it? Do I have to modify the CMakeLists.txt?
This is a scheme of my workspace:

build

devel

src
package 1

CMakeLists.txt

src (file.cpp are here)

include

package1.xml

package 2

...

Thanks in advance.

A:

The library package @dornhege recommends should be built like this:

http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/howto/building_libraries.html

If you only provide headers and no libraries, skip the library build and installation instructions. But, you should install the headers.
You other packages will reference it like this:
