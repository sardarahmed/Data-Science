Q:

Roscore and Sensors node are not starting on boot [Clearpath Husky]

Hello, I have recently got a husky from clearpath. When I boot the system the general behavior was to launch all the rosnodes on boot. I added my own laser scanner, and wanted to add it to the upstart menu. I used the robot_upstart package. But after adding my laser scanner launch file. On the next boot none of the nodes are starting. Is there a way to fix this issue.

A:

I removed all the job from /lib/systemd/systemd by using rosrun
robot_upstart uninstall job_name
and then augmented all the launch file to one master job file using:
 rosrun robot_upstart install my_custom_package/launch --job job_name --augment
