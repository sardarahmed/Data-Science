Q:

waypoint navigation in warehouse conditions

Hi,
My question is about using waypoint for an AMR.
Does follow_waypoint works really well in warehouse conditions ? is it the best solution if i want to develop a complete navigation solution for warehouse ?
any other solutions/remarks ... are welcomed.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Of course its not the best solution for any given specific application, its a generic demo I built in an afternoon :-) But its a reasonable starting point for a proof of concept or a component of your larger autonomy system. I for one use it frequently at home for various testing and see no reason why it couldn't work in a warehouse environment. In fact, my current project is making some POCs of waypoint following in a warehouse for a pseudo-inspection task that I'm using the ROS2 waypoint follower server for without much issue.
