Q:

rqt: a tabcontrol container for plugins

I really like rqt with its plugin system.
My rqt plugins are growing in numbers and can no longer coexist in one view.
Has anyone created a tab control where multiple rqt plugins can be organized on each tab?
I would like that kind of quick switching between views.
It is probably not that difficult, if it wasn't because I am quite unexperienced with qt development.

A:

rqt uses Qt dock widgets to implement the UI. Those are out-of-the-box able to be dragged-n-dropped. Beside rerepositioning them within the main windows you can "drop" them on another widget and they will change into a tab view. You can also "drop" them outside the main window to make them floating.

Hmmm, I tried a lot before and after asking the question, but now I finally managed to drop a widget in the right spot. It was not easy and rqt crashed several times. Also I was fooled by the fact that the tabs appear in the bottom. But thanks a lot for the answer.

If you can reproduce the crash it might be worth filling a ticket. Maybe it can be fixed...
