Q:

Which is easier/cheaper: Hbridge vs ESC for controlling a motor?

I was able to find a small ESC for about $12 off of ebay.  If you were designing a robot, would you see that and think?  

\$12 bucks for an ESC that connects to simple pulse-wave interface -
  sign me up!

Or would you think:

\$12 just to control a motor? I could throw together an H-bridge for
  $0.50 and be done with it.

My robot in particular actually has two motors and therefor $24 to control the two of them.  But the interface is really easy (plus has the added advantage of being R/C vs computer controlled with a simple change of connectors.
Which way would you go?

A:

What kind of motors?  ESCs typically are for brushless DC motors, which are electronically commutated DC three phase motors, and you can't run them with an H-bridge. 
That said, ESCs give you a lot of bang for the buck, and they're certainly worth $12 :)
