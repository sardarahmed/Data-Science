Q:

I am installing the  ros-by-example vol2 code2, and have a build problem with rbx2.
Below is command line:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

git clone https://github.com/pirobot/rbx1.git

cd rbx1

git checkout indigo-devel

cd ~/catkin_ws

catkin_make

Below is the error message:

A:

Please use the preformatted text button, the next time (the one with 1s and 0s for code).
You are missing a dependency, namely shape_msgs
Install with sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-shape-msgs and recompile
