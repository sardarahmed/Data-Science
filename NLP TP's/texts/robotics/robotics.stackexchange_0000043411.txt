Q:

Can't answer own question

I am trying to answer my own question: http://answers.ros.org/question/41798/gazebo-simulation-crashes-on-collision-with-wall/, but cannot see the post answer button for this question or other questions I have asked.
Was this facility removed with the last answers.ros update? If so, can we bring it back please.

I suggest you file a bug ticket against answers.ros.org at https://code.ros.org/trac/ros to track this issue. Please post an answer with the link to that bug ticket once you create it.
