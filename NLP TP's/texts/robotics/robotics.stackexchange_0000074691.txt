Q:

Exporting jpegs from bag file

I record my bag file using this command:
rosbag record /camera/rgb/image_raw -O kinectrgb

And
rosbag info kinectrgb.bag

For its content I get this:
path:        kinectrgb.bag
version:     2.0
duration:    6.2s
start:       Jun 20 2016 16:19:52.89 (1466432392.89)
end:         Jun 20 2016 16:19:59.09 (1466432399.09)
size:        162.7 MB
messages:    185
compression: none [185/185 chunks]
types:       sensor_msgs/Image [060021388200f6f0f447d0fcd9c64743]
topics:      /camera/rgb/image_raw   185 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image

But when I try to extract the images I don't get anything..
roslaunch export.launch

It says process has finished cleanly but I don't get the images in ROS_HOME ~/.ros

My launch file:
<launch>
  <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag" args="-d 2 $(find imagesequencekinect)/kinectrgb.bag"/>
  <node name="extract" pkg="image_view" type="extract_images" respawn="false" output="screen" cwd="ROS_HOME">
    <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_raw"/>
  </node>
</launch>

What am I doing wrong?
What does -d 2 mean in the launch file arg?

A:

Looks like you use the wrong topic name for extract_images in the launchfile
topics:      /camera/rgb/image_raw   185 msgs    : sensor_msgs/Image

vs
 <remap from="image" to="/camera/image_raw"/>

-d means "delay after advertising the topics before sending the first message" or as rosbag play --help puts it:
-d SEC, --delay=SEC   sleep SEC seconds after every advertise call (to allow subscribers to connect)
