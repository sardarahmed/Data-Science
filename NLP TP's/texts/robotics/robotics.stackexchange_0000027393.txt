Q:

Create a Joint between Base_Link and Table object

Hello to all respected Gazebo Users,
I am having trouble since last month getting everything to work. I am trying to put the base link of the UR10 robot to a table which is a Gazebo element and make it static so it doesn't move.
I have found out that i need to change the ur10.urdf.xacro and the ur10_joint_limited_robot.urdf.xacro. I added these lines to the last file:
 <link name="world" />

  <joint name="world_joint" type="fixed">
    <parent link="world" />
    <child link = "base_link" />
    <origin xyz="0.0 0.0 1.2" rpy="0.0 0.0 0.0" />
  </joint>

it works fine as you can see the height is 1.2 meters away from the floor but it doesn't matter since I just wanted to see it.
What do i have to change in order for the robot model to spawn fixed to the table, instead of the World!
Thanks in advanced,
Kind Regards

A:

When you insert your table inside an own xacro-file you should create it as table.urdf.xacro.
Then you need another file (e.g. table.xacro). The table.urdf.xacro is the description itself.
And the table.xacro is like:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<robot name="table" xmlns:xacro="http://ros.org/wiki/xacro">
    <xacro:include filename="$(find myworld_description)/urdf/table.urdf.xacro" />
    <xacro:table prefix=""/>
</robot>

Inside the robot-file you have to refer to the table.xacro:
<xacro:include filename="$(find myworld_description)/urdf/table.xacro" />

<joint name="Table_joint" type="fixed">
    <parent link="world" />
    <child link = "Table_link" />
    <origin xyz="0.0 -.7 0.7085" rpy="0.0 0.0 0.0" />
</joint>

It should work like this. You now just have to mount the robot like @nkoenig said.
