Q:

Hokuyo laser configuration

Hi guys,
I am currently using URG-04LX hokuyo laser and there is one problem that every time I power on this laser I need to reconfigure it all over again. Whenever I "ls -l /dev/ttyACM0", the feedback will always be crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Oct 17 15:10 /dev/ttyACM0
I was thinking could I possibly save the configuration(sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0) or is there any launch code that would possibly do this job?

A:

Here is the more fancy udev solution that we use (needs the hokuyo_node package) and /etc/ros/run.sh:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="Hokuyo Data Flex for USB", ATTRS{product}=="URG-Series USB Driver", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout", PROGRAM=="/etc/ros/run.sh hokuyo_node getID %N q", SYMLINK+="sensors/hokuyo_%c"

Besides access rights this uses the getID util in hokuyo_node to provide device symlinks as /dev/sensors/hokuyo_SERIAL to enable identifying specific sensors neverminds which ttyACM they land at.
/etc/ros/run.sh enables ROS
#!/bin/sh
. /etc/ros/setup.sh 
rosrun $@

/etc/ros/setup.sh is a symlink to the setup.sh in /opt/ros/DISTRO/setup.sh

What is the different between your solution and the solution provided by @Tones ?

This one also provides device ids based on the serial number. Also it sets access rights for any user (other), not only dialout, but you can configure that.
