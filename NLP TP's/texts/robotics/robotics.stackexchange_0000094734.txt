Q:

Got permission denied while trying to connect to Docker Daemon

I have installed the docker using the docker installation page. After installing the docker, I have tried the Case 1 and clone the docker repo. When I ran the command './run.sh', I am getting the following error. Please help.
Using options:
ROS distro: melodic
Image name: autoware/autoware
Tag prefix: latest
Cuda support: on
Pre-release version: off
UID: <1000>
Launching autoware/autoware:latest-melodic-cuda
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.

A:

@dynamicsoorya have you added your user to the docker group as mentioned here?
Otherwise it looks like you'll need to modify the run.sh file to call sudo docker instead of just docker

Yes, that definitely worked. Thank you very much for your help. I have added my user to the docker this way:
sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
And that worked.
Thanks a lot!
