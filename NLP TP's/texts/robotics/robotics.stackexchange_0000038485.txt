Q:

time for navigation in /move_base trajectory planner

Hi,
I have a problem where i will have a set of goals for the robot and i have to choose the one which takes less time. Though move_base does the same, this time details is important for my probabilistic logic. So is there a way to compute the estimated time for the navigation to a particular goal. Is there a package that does this or can i tweak somewhere to get this information. I make use of the /move_base package inside the navigation stack as of now. Any pointers and suggestions here is appreciated.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

Indirectly there is. move_base provides a service:
~make_plan (nav_msgs/GetPlan)
This doesn't give you time, but a path length that given an assumed speed gives you a time estimate.
