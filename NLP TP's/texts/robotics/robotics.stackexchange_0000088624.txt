Q:

How to launch a node with it's dependencies have started

I have 5 launch file. Some node must start when some nodes have started , or they cannot work.
If all the nodes are written by myself, it is easy to deal with.
But now, I use some packages like moveit, whose code is not in my workspace and I donnot want to rewrite it :

A:

The capabilities package can be used to manage startup dependencies between launch files: http://wiki.ros.org/capabilities Most of the documentation lives on http://docs.ros.org/lunar/api/capabilities/html/ . It's a bit rough, so I'd advise that you browse around a bit to get a sense for all of the things that are possible.
