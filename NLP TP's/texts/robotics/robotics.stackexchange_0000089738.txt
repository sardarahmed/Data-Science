Q:

Error: Device /dev/ttyACM0 is already locked

Hello. I am a ROS beginner. I am doing SLAM of turtlebot 2 in the ubuntu 14.04, ros (indigo) personal computer environment.
I am doing this tutorial to add hokuyo.

http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/hydro/Adding%20a%20Hokuyo%20laser%20to%20your%20Turtlebot

However, the hokuyo node does not start except the first time.
$ rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node
[ERROR] [1543820081.096981504]: Exception thrown while opening Hokuyo.
Device /dev/ttyACM0 is already locked. Try 'lsof | grep /dev/ttyACM0' to find other processes that currently have the port open. (in hokuyo::laser::open) You may find further details at http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting

and
$ lsof | grep /dev/ttyACM0

What should I do?

hokuyo node does not start except the first time.

that "first time" is probably an indication of what is going on.
How are you stopping the node?
Comment by saito on 2018-12-03:
ctrl+c　or ✕ on terminal.
Comment by Mehdi. on 2018-12-03:
you could run ps aux | grep hokuyo and see if there are some processes still running with hokuyo name. If it is the case kill them by running kill -9 pocess_id
