Q:

Problem: Octomap is not working with Kinect Pointcloud

Hello Everyone,
I am using kinect for creating pointcloud and passing /camera/depth/point from kinect freenect_camera to octomap_server by remapping octomap cloud_in point cloud to /camera/depth/point.  Everything is working fine, Kinect is publishing  proper pointcloud, successfully remapping from cloud_in to /camera/depth/point.
Octomap_server is publishing all topics mentioned in [Octomap_server](http://wiki.ros.org/octomap_server).

I tried to visualize using rviz but I am not getting anything in markerArray and Map I also try to visualize using topic but nothing is coming. Plz help me to rectify this.
If I missed any step for generating 3D occupancy grid map plz let me know, Is there any Slam exist (except rgbdslam and compatible in Ros Hydro) which publishes pointcloud2, and can be inputed to octomap.

A:

Have you changed the topic in the MotionPlanning plugin from "/planning_scene" to "/move_group/monitored_planning_scene" ?

I didn't do this, actually I didn't find proper document for this. In Octomap_server, they only mentioned that it will subscribe pointcloud2, can you do me favor plz give me proper link for octomap, and tell me other requirements to change.

In RVIZ if you click the "Add" button, you can add the MotionPlanning plugin. To get octomap, you have to run sudo apt-get install ros-your-distro-octomap, there are some other packages also for octomap (in terminal and while you have typed the above command press tab twice to see them.

Everything is installed already, I searched plugins in rviz but it is not there. Is there any way to add/install particular plugin in rviz.
