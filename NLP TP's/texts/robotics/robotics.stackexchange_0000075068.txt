Q:

rqt_image_view Segmentation Fault

Howdy folks
I am using ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Since recently when I want to start rqt_image_view, nothing is happening and then I get a segmentation fault.
All other rqt gui plugins appear to work fine (like RVIZ, Bag, etc.).
I un-installed and then re-installed ROS,  but that didn't help.
Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?
Thanks in advance

A:

Fixed it:
I found that OpenCV was the culprit. I am using OpenCV 2.4.11 and in CMAKE I had configured it with QT on. I now reconfigured it without QT, rebuilt and re-installed it and now rqt_image_view is working normally.
