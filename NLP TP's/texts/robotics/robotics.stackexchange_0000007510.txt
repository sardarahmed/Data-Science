Q:

Improving Velocity estimation

I have a sensor reduction model which gives me a velocity estimate of a suspension system(velocity 1) .
This suspension system estimate velocity is used to calculate another velocity(velocity 2) via a transfer function/plant model.
Can I use velocity 2 to improve my velocity estimate (velocity 1) through Kalman filtering or through some feedback system.??

V1 is "estimated" using these two sensors.That is fed into a geroter pump (Fs in diagram) which pumps fluid to manupulate the damper viscous fluid thereby applying resistance to the forces applied to the car body. There is no problem did I have an velocity sensor on the spring.I could measure it accurately but now I only have an estimate. I am trying to make the estimate better.Assume I have a model/plant or transfer function already that gives me the V2 given a V1.

A:

If you have transfer function such that 
$$
\frac{V_2}{V_1} = H \\
V_2 = H V_1 \\
$$
Then wouldn't your estimate of $V_1$ be given by inverting the transfer function?
$$
V_1 = H^{-1} V_2
$$
The problem is that you can't use this to measure $V_1$, and here's why:
Your measurements are an estimate of $V_1$. 
$$
V_{est} = f(V_1)
$$
You feed that estimate into the pump and get a flow output. 
$$
V_2 = H V_{est}
$$
Now, if you invert the plant, you do NOT get a measurement of $V_1$, you get a measurement of your original estimate. 
$$
V_{est} = H^{-1} V_2
$$
It's like you are trying to draw your own ruler and then use that ruler to see if you drew the ruler correctly. It's a circular definition that's not going to get you anything useful.
