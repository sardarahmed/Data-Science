Q:

No API Found in ROS Wiki mirror

Hi all!
I've just followed this tutorial to create an offline mirror of the ROS Wiki and API, but the API is only populated with diamondback and independent API folders. Where have Fuerte, Groovy and Hydro gone? It there something wrong with the mirror scripts or the website?
in folder roswiki/doc I've executed
$ ls -lah

I don't have any rosbot user in my laptop!

A:

The wiki dumps you referenced do not contain the full API doc folders. Simply because we are talking about hundreds of GB of data here. Currently there is no way to mirror the complete API docs data efficiently.

I'm leaving a proper internet connection for some weeks and, at least, I'd like to have roscpp, rospy, tf and other core documentations. Do you know any way to get them?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-10-28:
You could clone the repos and generate the docs locally.

It is also flat file, so something like http://scrapy.org/ might work.
