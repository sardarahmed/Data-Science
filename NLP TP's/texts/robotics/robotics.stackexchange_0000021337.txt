Q:

To calculate roll,pitch and yaw

How do I calculate roll,pitch and yaw value from the position co ordinates of the drone, that is x,y and z from the gps sensor???
Using the x,y and z co ordinates I have to calculate roll,pitch and yaw. What is the equation for this??

A:

The position coordinates x, y, z are inadequate information to compute the roll pitch and yaw.
x, y, and z are the position of the vehicle in space. roll, pitch, and yaw are the attitude or orientation. They can change independently. Aka you can change the orientation of the vehicle independently from the position of the vehicle.
