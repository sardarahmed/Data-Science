Q:

robot_pose_ekf is there a way to override the tf base_footprint

Robot-pose-ekf it publishes a tf :odom_combined â†’ base_footprint. I would like to change it to base_link. How is this best done rather then adding a base_footprint to my urdf.

A:

I added the base_footprint and static tf to base_link. This seemed to be the easiest solution that works.
