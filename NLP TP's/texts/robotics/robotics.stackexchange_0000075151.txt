Q:

Turtlebot Spinning

I'm having an issue when simulating a turtlebot in gazebo where the turtlebot will spin around while being given velocity commands. I've had this issue both when following this tutuorial: http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/03/9/ , and when writing scripts to give velocity commands myself. The turtlebot can eventually navigate to its target location, it just spins on the way and sometimes will spin so much that it falls over.  This isn't an issue when using teleop commands.

A:

I've found that turtlebot_navigation requires a bit of tuning. It's not bad if the (simulated) turtlebot is already facing in the general direction of a nav goal, but if the little guy has to do a 180, it's Spin City (extreme overshoot when coming about). Here are the settings I use (from my launch file):
  <!-- move_base -->
  <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/move_base.launch.xml"/>
  <!-- default turtlebot is poorly-tuned-->
  <param name="move_base/DWAPlannerROS/max_rot_vel" value="1.0"/>
  <param name="move_base/DWAPlannerROS/acc_lim_theta" value="10.0"/>

This (mostly) damps the overshoot in my setup.

Thanks, that fixed the problem for me. The question is, whether this is a problem.

If move_base is poorly tuned for
gazebo simulation, is it good tuned
for the real robot?

If it is good tuned for the real
robot, is gazebo bad simulating the
real robot?

Good question. Unfortunately, I don't own a Turtlebot (would love to have one, though).

Oh, BTW, would you mind marking the answer as correct if it did the trick?

That can only be done by the original poster.

Ah, missed that.
