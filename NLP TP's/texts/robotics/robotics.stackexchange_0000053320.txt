Q:

Please correct this python script to send data on USB0 port?

#!/usr/bin/env python

from serial import Serial
from time import sleep

class Create:
        
    def __init__(self, tty="/dev/ttyUSB0"):
        
        self.timeout = 5
        self.port = Serial(tty, 57600, timeout= self.timeout)
                

    def start(self):
        
        
        self.__sendNow(P,0,0,0)
        sleep(1)
        self.__sendNow(V,0,0,100)
        sleep(10)

    def stop(self):
        
        self.__sendNow(V,0,0,0)

A:

Thank you viewers, I found the mistake and corrected it ....
this is just deceleration of class there is no command to write data on USB port.
there is just two line code to do the same
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyS1', 19200, timeout=1)
ser.write('5')
