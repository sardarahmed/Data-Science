Q:

Do kinect topics depend on drivers

I happened to have downloaded a bag file of Kinect which was recorded with the help of libfreenect driver. If i develop a node which is for kinect and that uses Openni driver. Will there be differences in the type of topics that are created by both drivers in terms of images and point clouds?

A:

To answer your question directly, yes, the different kinect drivers have different ROS APIs (meaning the topics they publish are different). You can take a look at the wiki pages for the different drivers (kinect_camera which uses libfreenect, and openni_camera, which uses the openni drivers) to compare.

Thanks it really helped. From this i draw that when i write a node for kinect running on different drivers  in ros i should pay attention to the topic names. So that the subscription is not hampered.
