A:

Saving frames to disk will be slow. Gazebo has to pull information off the graphics card, convert it to a png, then dump the information to disk. A smaller image will be faster.
We have improved rendering, but this won't be released until Gazebo6 in July of this year. You can try it out by compiling Gazebo from source.
