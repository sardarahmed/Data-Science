Q:

Turtlebot doesn't start rotating on calibration

It's almost the same with this question but I open as new question since that question is not closed and Turtlebot software must have been updated since then.
Calibration movement doesn't start and keeps saying "Still waiting for imu". Stdout result is below (long, sorry). On other turtlebots calibration go properly. I found that the green power light on iRobot Create goes off with the beep sound when I start running calibration launch file, even though dashboard still shows the battery amount and breakers in green.
Env) Ubuntu 10.04, ROS electric as well as turtlebot-robot

Comment by mmwise on 2011-11-15:
does it actually halt? ..it seems like it gets the imu data if it calculates the drift.  sometimes when the create is running the light goes off but it's still running? when it says aligning base with wall it is trying to command the base to move.. check to see if cmd_vel is being published.

A:

Today calibration is successful. What I did before trying calibration is to re-do Turtlebot bringup tutorial (I remember I did it even before I asked this question). Anyway thank @mwise_wg and all!
