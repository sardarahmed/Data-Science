Q:

Dwb local planner or standard navigation stack?

According to the D. Lu's github page and his video conference, Dwb local planner seems to be a good alternative to the standard navigation implementation.
Yet I wonder if anyone has tried it and if it is easier to use than the standard approach.
Currently, I am a little confused since M. Lu advises me to check the standard navigation stack

A:

They are both viable alternatives. However, if you are just becoming familiar with ROS Navigation, I would recommend starting with the standard turtlebot configuration linked in the other answer before trying to get the new planner working.
