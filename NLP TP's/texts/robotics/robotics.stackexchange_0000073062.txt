Q:

pr2_nav_tutorial.launch is not a launch file name

i run the
"PR2 Simulator Workshop"
and in section
8.PR2 Navigation Stack Demo
I create a launch script for starting all necessary navigation components, and save it as ~/pr2_nav_tutorial.launch in my home directory (user@ubuntu).
When i run:
roslaunch ~/pr2_nav_tutorial.launch
I take:
/home/user/pr2_nav_tutorial.launch] is not a launch file name.
Also, i have not the pr2_nav_tutorial package.
