Q:

I am the new user in ubuntu 14.04 and ros-indigo,i dont have any ideal how to solve it
When I want to install the Indigo version of the Turtlebot package from source using the instructions here:

When I run this step:rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y in ~/rocon it failed
i see the similar in ROS Answers so i follow and  try to  runrosdep install --from-paths src -i -y -ragain,but i got
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y ros-indigo-turtlebot-gazebo] failed
apt: Failed to detect successful installation of [ros-indigo-turtlebot-gazebo]

i try to ignore that and go next step   catkin_make and it is successful
i run this step:rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y in ~/kobuki,it  failed again
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar] failed

i used catkin_make and it is successful  too
finally, i run this step:rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y in~/turtlebot ,it  failed and got error at catkin_make too
rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y error

A:

Are you able to complete the step "2.3.1 Preparation" on that page?  Also what platform are you running ubuntu on? To help you more we need to know more about what you've done to setup your computer to try to reproduce your problem.
