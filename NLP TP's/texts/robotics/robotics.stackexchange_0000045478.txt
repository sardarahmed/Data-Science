Q:

Libfreenect not finding the Kinect

This is sort of a follow up to this about libfreenect. I successfully got ROS installed on RaspberryPi (ARM) and compiled freenect_stack from @piyushk. I complete all of the steps, but it can't find the Kinect:
[kevin@raspberrypi freenect_stack]$ rosrun freenect_camera freenect_node

Is there something else I am missing?

Hi Kevin - any suggestions around a couple of problems I've having building this:libfreenect: No definition of [libxmu-dev] for OS [debian]
freenect_launch: Missing resource pcl (I've installed libxmu-dev and freenect_camera: No definition of [log4cxx] for OS version [] where to get log4cxx?

and finally - MSG: gencfg_cpp on:Test.cfg
CMake Error at cmake/cfgbuild.cmake:66 (string):
string sub-command REPLACE requires at least four arguments.
Thanks Mark

lsusb gives me  - "Bus 001 Device 008: ID 045e:02b0 Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Motor" on the Pi

A:

I don't have any experience with the RaspberryPi. I am not sure how well libfreenect supports it. Can you check to see if lsusb gives a suitable output:
lsusb

lsusb should give an output similar to:
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 045e:02b0 Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Motor
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 045e:02ad Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Audio
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 045e:02ae Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Camera

Also, I am not sure which binaries inside libfreenect can be run on the pi, but hopefully atleast tiltdemo should work:
rosrun libfreenect tiltdemo

Let me know if the above work.

No I only see the Motor and the Audio and Camera don't show up. There appears to be others having the same issue, so I has more to do with the RaspberryPi and nothing to do with your code. Some people are thinking it has to do with the RPi's USB implementation.

Kevin - should you find a solution to this please let me know - am looking into it myself can covered/built from scratch all suggestions I've found thus far..... Thanks Mark
Comment by Kevin on 2012-11-20:
doing more research, many have built libfreenect for RPi, but I cannot find anyone that has really gotten it to work. RPi can see the kinect motor but not the camera and audio. I think this is a RPi issue and not anything else. RPi probably has a bandwidth issue on the USB bus. Still looking at it.
Comment by MarkyMark2012 on 2012-11-20:
Yep agreed - I'm getting the same issues as you...shall keep looking
Comment by MarkyMark2012 on 2012-11-25:
Kevin - by way of an update. Received new 512Mb board this w/e and updated the firmware. Now I'm able to see motor, audio and camera. A quick test of the tiltdemo also works. How did you get freenect_stack to build?

Glad to hear you can see the camera now. I had no errors ... try opening a new question and posting the errors.
