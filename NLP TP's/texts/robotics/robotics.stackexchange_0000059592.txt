Q:

how does amcl updates turtlebot's current location to move_base

Hi
I was reading up on ROS's navigation stack as well as amcl 's documentation when I realized from the stack's diagram
that move_base does not subscribe to /amcl_pose , which amcl uses to publish the robot's estimated pose in the map. In that case how does move_base update the current localized pose of the robot ?
Thanks

A:

Everything is send via TF. AMCL usually provides the /map -> /odom transform.

Correct me if I am wrong, so the robot's current position is maintained via a odom transform from the robot's initial position? Also with the AMCL active, the robot no longer subscribe to /tf from the sensor and odometry source?
