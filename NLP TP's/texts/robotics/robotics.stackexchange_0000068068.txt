Q:

vision navigation in indigo

Hello,
I'm searching a package which could be used for real-time vision navigation in indigo.
Some people advice me to use rgbdslam , but it can't work in indigo.
Anyone else could tell me if there is package that could solve my problem?
I only have a kinect x360 and a IMU, and I use ubuntu 14.04 and indigo , I want to let my robot avoid obstacles in my workspace.
Thanks first.

A:

According to the wiki, rgbdslam is made for fuerte, not indigo, that is probably why rgbdslam isn't working. You can try looking into OpenCV and applying it for your setup. My advice would be to write a vision node dealing with information from your kinect, then have that vision node publish data to your navigation node, but keep researching, maybe somebody will have a better idea.
