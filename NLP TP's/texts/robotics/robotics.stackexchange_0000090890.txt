Q:

unable to locate ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator

Hello,
I've purchased the ROS book Programming Robots with ROS to help me understand how i can controll the robot i've built.  I was having trouble setting up ROS to work on my ubuntu laptop so i downloaded a pre-setup virtual machine from nortrix.  I'm also getting the same issue on the virtual machine, the book says i need to setup the simulation stack, when i do get the follow error :
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator
How can i move forward on this problem.  I've seen there is a github page for it, do i just clone it ? https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator
Also when i run "sudo apt-get update"  i get :
Err http://security.ubuntu.com trusty-security InRelease

Thanks for the quick reply.  Yeah thats what i was typing to get the response "E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator".  Any other ideas?
Comment by mali on 2019-03-13:
oh sorry, i did not know that you were typing the same command. you might need to clone simulator pkgs from github and build it. Do not forget to source your workspace

@mali:

you might need to clone simulator pkgs from github and build it.

can you clarify why you give this advice?
Building packages from source is very rarely needed, and should really only be a last resort option.
Comment by mali on 2019-03-13:
I think it is the second option he has, as he could not install it using sudo apt-get install ...
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-03-13:
The first thing to do would be to figure out why apt claims to not be able to find that package for installation. Only if it turns out that it's really unavailable, then we could consider recommending building it from source.
Comment by resolver101757 on 2019-03-13:
how do i find out why apt cant find the file?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-03-13:
There is no direct way afaik, but can you install any ROS package using apt? Did you run sudo apt-get update recently?
Comment by resolver101757 on 2019-03-13:
thanks for your comments.  I feel we're getting further.  I've added the source and the response from sudo-apt update.  Any ideas from here? your help is appreciated.
Comment by resolver101757 on 2019-03-13:
ignore my last comment.  the vm had disconnected from the network and DNS screwed up hence not connecting.   Re-initialized the network and ran sudo apt-get update and its getting further, ill post further comments when it gets further.
Comment by resolver101757 on 2019-03-13:
right this partcular issue is now resolved.  Thanks for your comments.  Once i resolved the networking.  apt-get update updated the catalgoues and i could run sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator successfully.
