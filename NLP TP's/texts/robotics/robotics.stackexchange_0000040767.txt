Q:

Robot_description not found

I installed Fuerte using 'sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-desktop'
I can rosmake various packages, including arm_navigation/planning_environment.
However, when I run 'roslaunch planning_environment environment_server.launch', the service cannot find the (presumably PR2) robot model:
...: Robot model '/robot_description' not found! Did you remap 'robot_description'?
I thought any required models would have come down with the ros-fuerte-pr2-desktop installation. Unless by side effect, I did not remap 'robot_description'.
Anything else I need to install or configure?
Thanks!
Andreas

The problem ended up being libmysql.so missing various symbols. This defect then prevented Gazebo from initializing properly. Re-installing libmysqlclient16 made the problem disappear. Unclear how the defective library came down. (Thanks to Lorenz for the answer, though.)

A:

Did you upload a robot description to the parameter server? Normally, you execute the planning launch file when you either have a real robot or simulation running. You can also upload the robot description with
roslaunch pr2_description upload_pr2.launch
