Q:

Post processing gmapping generated maps to add glass wall information

The gmapping system misses glass surfaces since it makes use of laser data. Unfortunately, we have an environment that has quite a few glass walls/doors. Has anyone run into this issue? If yes, how do you folks suggest we handle it? I can always modify the map manually in an image editor. Is there a better way?

A:

There's a related question here, which links to some answers. The problem is that if these glass walls are actually invisible in the laser scan, the local trajectory planner can still try to go through them, even if you manually paint the walls into the global map. So you'll need something like layered costmaps which contain the "no go zones".
Or you could do what we did with our (small) glass door, which is stick a couple sheets of paper onto it at a certain height... :-)
Or try additionally using an ultrasound ranger for local obstacle avoidance, if your robot happens to have one (not tried, but should work).

Thanks for your answer :). We thought of covering up glass surfaces already. The problem is that our environment is an entire floor of the building, and covering up all the glass surfaces will be tedious. I was hoping I can somehow detect glass and augment the maps.

(I've observed that the laser does seem to detect glass when incidence is near normal.)
