Q:

New Kinect One Permssion issues

Hello Folks,
I am using the Kinect One, but I am having permissions issues.
I'm using this rospackage:
https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2

I followed every instruction given in the README files in order to install the drivers, but I can't run the roslaunch without first running the following command from the "libfreenect" folder:
sudo .~/libfreenect2/examples/protonect/bin/Protonect

After I do that and close the program, then I can lunch my Kinect rospackage (Protonect is the executable example project that comes with libfreenect).
I did the udev rules and all that already, and I installed/re-installed it in three different machines, and I still have the same problem in all three.
Is there a way to give the Protonect executable root permission/access so that "sudo" is never again needed? Would that solve the problem?

A:

Have you tried adding a line specific to your ProductID to your 90-kinect2.rules?
from the ReadMe:
Check if the idProduct of your sensor is in the list. If not just add another line with the idProduct of your sensor. You can obtain it by running dmesg | grep "045e". Reconnect the sensor and you should be able to access it.

See my output below (which is similar what's already on the README file example)
