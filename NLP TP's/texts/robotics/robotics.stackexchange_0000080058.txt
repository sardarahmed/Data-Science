Q:

QtCreator breaking my workspace

Recently, adding a package to Qt creator as shown in the IDE wiki and compiling it once makes it impossible to install it with catkin_make. I get the following error:
Install the project...
-- Install configuration: ""
CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:41 (file):
  file failed to open for writing (Permission denied):

    /usr/local/.catkin

Makefile:115: recipe for target 'install' failed
make: *** [install] Error 1

In the wiki, somebody wrote:

Recently this has started to fail,
because the main CMakeLists is a
symlink to a non writtable location.
The workaround is to make a copy to
toplevel.cmake instead of using a
symlink. And if you want the project
to be named something else than
"Project" then add a line at the top
with "project(MyProjectName)"

What does this mean and how to do it?
Using Ros Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04

A:

Maybe something like this?
$ cp -L toplevel.cmake [project directory]

The -L flag just copies the file pointed at by a symlink, if the argument is a symlink.
