A:

Have you had a look at this page http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables? If you just want to quickly compile a bunch of example,  do
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:`pwd`

in the folder where you have kept the tutorial packages. Otherwise, the tutorials are very comprehensive usually.

When I try to add in groovy another path like
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH: pwd 
after reopening the termianl or in a new tab, the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH does not contains the earlier added path.  Why?
