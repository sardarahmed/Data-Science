Q:

Rosdep failed to detect argparse (Debian)

Hi guys,
I'm trying to build ROS hydro/groovy (recently switched to hydro upon hearing that groovy may have had more than its fair share of bugs) on Debian Jesse and have been having a lot of trouble getting rosdep to run all the way through. I tried skipping rosdep and just manually installing the packages with apt-get when the catkin build process stalled on a missing package, but once I thought I got them all it got bogged down in a mess of linking errors. This made me think rosdep maybe was doing something other than just getting apt-get to fill all of the dependencies. I finally managed to build collada-dom-dev and so rosdep would stop failing there but now it fails to find python argparse. It's my understanding that argparse is provided by python 2.7 (the library libpython2.7-stdlib specifically) which I verified by checking packages.debian.org/jessie/python-argparse. Does anyone know how to get rosdep to recognize that python contains argparse and to link the libraries there? I will update the wiki with everything I learn from your responses!
Peter

A:

You probably need to contribut a patch to the rosdep rules for debian.  The easiest will be to alias a request for argparse to install lipython2.7-stdlib for jessie while leaving the rule to use python-argparse for squeeze and wheezy.

I'm  not the OP, but just submitted a pull request with the patch, tested with squeeze

Just installing on arm - still getting 'python-argparse has no installation candidate' on wheezy armhf (mk802ii) - hoping it's in libpython2.7-stdlib...

the build completed with no errors.
