But when running command on terminal

the message appeared as"

A:

I just got the solution.
just run the command to get permission.
sudo chmod 0777 /dev/ttyUSB0

I found this solution but there is still a problem I have to run this command every time I start run the brown driver..
the same is with the terminal command to change the port setting from ttyS0 to ttyACM0.
rosparam set /brown/irobot_create_2_1/port /dev/ttyACM0
