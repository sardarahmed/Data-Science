Q:

Can anybody suggest cheap Test Robots like TurtleBots that could be bought and which runs on ROS?

I want to buy a real robot so that I could test out some of my source code and see how it works on a real robot. I wanted to buy TurtleBot but it is very expensive around $2000. Can anybody suggest any cheaper ones??
Thanks

You should maybe specify, what your robot should be able to do, which sensors it should have and so on. You could look into kits, that transform your smartphone into a driving robot. Would propably be the best bang for the buck

A:

If you're willing to put in a few hours of work in you can very easily build your own turtlebot. Just by a compatible base like the irobot create or the kobuki which has ROS support and then add your cpu/sensors on top. The kobuki especially comes with enough paraphenalia so that you don't need to wire any electronics for a basic turtlebot-like configuration (just plug'n play). This will save you a good chunk of money.
The turtlebot source code can then be a very good reference as to how you can arrange your launchers and robot description to completely ros'ify your robot.

+1. I doubt you could find anything cheaper than Turtlebot that's completely off-the-shelf, but costs can be reduced based on how much you're willing to rig yourself. It's also a great learning experience for ROS that gives you an understanding of the system and hardware.
