It's now in two systems.  There's not good documentation yet.  I'll be writing some soon.  I'll post a link here when I write it up.

I'd like to do a source install also... @tfoote have you written up this documentation yet?

A:

The catkin guide. As tully says, its still in the works, but its easy enough to follow for building. There is a working rosinstaller you can build off - just add your stacks to the bottom of it:
https://raw.github.com/willowgarage/catkin/master/test/test.rosinstall
To start your rosinstall, make sure you have rosinstall updated to the latest version and run it with the --catkin option:
rosinstall --catkin ~/catkin https://raw.github.com/willowgarage/catkin/master/test/test.rosinstall
