Q:

Get sensor data using Crazyflie ROS Package

Hello everyone,
I'm new to ROS, I just learnt the basic but I have never coded ROS before. However, I need to get/store sensor data from Crazyflie and publish it on the screen for my project. Can anyone give me some steps I need to do or some references with similar code I can consult to achieve my purpose? If it's possible, the simple or detailed it is, the better.
Thank you!

Welcome to the ROS Community! Searching around the ROS wiki will give you the answer most of the times!
I found this package while looking for relevant stuff. Assuming you have Crazyflie 1.0 (or 2.0 with stock firmware) this package promises to work out of the box for you! Unfortunately I do not have a Crazyflie to test it, but seems like a good start even if it is not exactly what you need.
For a quick example, if you just need all the imu data that is being published to be stored in a file, you could just open a terminal (while the driver of the Crazyflie is running), and execute rostopic echo /topic_name >> filename.txt while replacing topic_name with your preferred topic (/imu) and filename.txt with your preferred file.
Good luck with your project!
