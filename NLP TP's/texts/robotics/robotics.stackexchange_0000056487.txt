Q:

problem with tf No transform from /laser_link to frame /odom

hi,
I am new to ros, i am trying to view pointcloud in rviz. But i have problem with tf.
I am publishing /odom -> /base_link using [tf::TransformBroadcaster]
and  /base_link -> /laser_link as static transform from launch file.
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="laser_link_tfS" args="1 3 2 0 0 0 base_link laser_link  1000" />

But in rviz its showing No transform from [/laser_link] to frame [/odom]
I tried urdf file but i didnt solve the problem.
thanks in advance.
EDIT
rosrun tf view_frames

output pdf is here http:// www. tempsend.com/AEAD417228 (remove spaces)

could you show frames graph ? you can generate pdf file of it with rosrun tf view_frames. Also you could try increasing publishing rate from 1000 to 100

@rock-ass frames pdf added.

A:

The most likely cause I can see from your description of the problem is that the timestamp of the tf transform you´re broadcasting is not correct. As requested also in a comment, you should edit your post with further info. You can also try both of these commands:
rosrun tf tf_echo base_link laser_link 
rosrun tf tf_echo odom base_link

If the first one fails to show a transfom, your static publisher does not work. if the second one fails, your TransformBroadcaster is the culprit.
/edit: As you can see from the posted frames.pdf, the transform between odom and base_link published to tf is 44 years old, while the transform published to by the static publishers is timestamped ~0.5 seconds into the future (as it should be).
This suggests you don´t timestamp the data when publishing via the TransformBroadcaster correctly.

for both commands its showing warning  TF_OLD_DATA ignoring data from the past for frame /imu_link at time 0 according to authority /odom_publisher_node

See edit above. Fix the timestamp and try if it works then.

It worked after adding ros::Time::now();
thanks

Insightful answer, didn't thought of timestamps in first place
