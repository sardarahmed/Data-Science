Q:

Python Forward Kinematics

How can I perform forward kinematics in python?
Can I use MoveItCommander to perform forward kinematics? I don't see analogous classes/functions as exist in the C++ kinematics API.
Similar questions have suggested using pykdl_utils instead, but I see that that package last existed in hydro. I also imagine that the package python_orocos_kdl has the functionality, but I'm having trouble finding useful documentation.

A:

I was able to clone the https://github.com/gt-ros-pkg/hrl-kdl indigo-devel branch directly into my catkin_ws and use it for FK w/o any problems - so far.
from urdf_parser_py.urdf import URDF
from pykdl_utils.kdl_kinematics import KDLKinematics

# pykdl_utils setup
robot_urdf = URDF.from_xml_string(urdf_str)
kdl_kin = KDLKinematics(robot_urdf, base_link, end_link)

test_jt_angles = [0, 0, 0]
pose = kdl_kin.forward(test_jt_angles)

Thanks for the tip you gave me on my question. May still end up going down that route if I run into problems.
