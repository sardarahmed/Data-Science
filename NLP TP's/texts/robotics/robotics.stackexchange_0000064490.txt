Q:

How to run controller_manager

Hi All,
I use a launch file to load a controller:
 <node name="controller_spawner" pkg="controller_manager" type="spawner" respawn="false" output="screen" args="controller/twist"/>

When I run the launch file, the system said waiting for service controller_manager/load_controller.
But when I type rosservice call controller_manager/load_controller it told me that service is not available.
Do I need to run controller_manager first before calling that service? If yes, how I run controller_manager?
Thanks in advanced.

A:

The spawner script is one of the command-line tools offered by the controller_manager ROS package (doc), and it does not start a controller_manager instance.
The controller_manageris typically instantiated inside your robot hardware abstraction (hardware_interface::RobotHW specialization). If using gazebo_ros_control, this is already done by the existing plugins (Tutorial), but if using on a custom abstraction, you have to do the setup yourself.

Can you reproduce the results of this tutorial? http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_control
If in indigo, you'll have to specify the <hardware_interface> element as a child of <joint>, not <actuator>, in your URDF transmissions.
