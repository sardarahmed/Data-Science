Q:

How to use the Mac book pro's iSight camera in ROS for the webcam?

I'm a ROS newbie and would like to use the internal camera called I believe iSight on my Mac Book Pro laptop to do some image processing development. I would like to know if anyone else has gone down this path and learn from their experinces. I'm running Parallels with Ubuntu 14.04 on my Mac. Thanks for any help, Phil.

A:

The iSight camera is a regular USB UVC webcam. You can tell Parallels to pass the camera through to the VM, and then use usb_cam to publish images from it in ROS.

Dan, thanks for the help!  I got further by installing the usb_cam package and then executing it.  I'm getting the same 'CalibrationFile is missing'  error that is described at the very bottom of this link: http://laukh.com/ros/usb_cam/. Can you tell me how/if I need to calibrate? I'm very confused.

If you want to calibrate your camera, you can use camera_calibration. Whether or not you need to do that depends entirely on your application. If you don't want to calibrate, you can ignore those messages.
