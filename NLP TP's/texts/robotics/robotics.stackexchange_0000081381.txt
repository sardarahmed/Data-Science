Q:

Make error trying to build kitti_to_rosbag

I am trying to use https://github.com/ethz-asl/kitti_to_rosbag/tree/master/kitti_to_rosbag as a package to convert the kitti dataset to rosbag, which can be further used with Autoware for object detection. I have installed all the dependencies mentioned in the package.xml of kitti_to_rosbag. However I get the error when I use catkin_make in the workspace  :
[ 50%] Completed 'glog_src'   
[ 50%] Built target glog_src  
Makefile:138: recipe for target 'all' failed  
make: *** [all] Error 2  
Invoking "make -j4 -l4" failed

Being a beginner in ROS and having a deadline for this task, I am not able to figure out how to rectify this. Any and all help is appreciated
system : Ubuntu 16.04
ROS  : Kinetic

The real error is most likely somewhere earlier in your console. Without that it's going to be really difficult to help you.

I have exactly the same question, however can you please elaborate how and where did you install the dependencies?  Find my complete question at http://answers.ros.org/question/264817/i-ran-into-dependency-problem-with-building-catkin_ws-for-kitti_to_rosbag-package/

A:

I have installed all the dependencies mentioned in the package.xml of kitti_to_rosbag

I would still recommend you run:
rosdep update
rosdep check --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src

if anything is missing, run the same command, but replace check with install.
