Q:

What is the difference between TransformStamped and PoseStamped

Hello,
what is the difference between geometry_msgs/TransformStamped and geometry_msgs/PoseStamped?
I know that the first one is used for transformation but is it possible to replace the second one with the first one?
I got the geometry_msgs/TransformStamped from vicon_bridge node but actually i need the PoseStamped to represent the pose of the robot and objects.
Maybe i miss understand something, any one can help?

A:

The only real difference between them is that TransformStamped has a child_frame_id field, and PoseStamped doesn't. This implies that the former specifies a transform from the header's frame_id to child_frame_id. However, it's just a message, and does not affect the tf transform tree.
In any case, just from a brief glance at the package wiki page, it looks like they're just stuffing a pose in there. You can pull the source code from their repo and modify it to output the message type you want.

Thanks Tom,
I wrote a node that subscribes to TransformStamped and publish  PoseStamped.

That will also work, though it adds an extra step.
