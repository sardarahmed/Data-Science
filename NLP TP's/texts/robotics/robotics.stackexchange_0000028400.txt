Q:

how can I reset the robot to the same situations in the beginning of each running?

hi, everybody,
I am running the experiments that control a robot to move. But I want to run the same experiments three times. That means I need robot restart with the same situations (same position, same orientation, ...) in the beginning of each running. How can I reset the robot to the same situations?

by the way, I have to use gazebo 6 because my project is from two years ago, and I could not change it to new gazebo, because it is a huge project.
