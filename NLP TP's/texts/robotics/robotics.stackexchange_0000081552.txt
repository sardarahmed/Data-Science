Q:

What message to use to publish the position of a rover

Hi,
I a newbie here. I've been trying to understand the appropriate message to use when publishing the position of a rover on a map. I have a topic of a "chassis" which I want to use to publish this position. I was using JointState but realised that it related to joints on the robot itself. NavSatFix is a possibility but this merely reports what the GPS says. It shouldn't be the ultimate source of truth. What I've been looking at is http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

A:

Not sure if I understand the question, but if you are looking for a message type, look at the nav_msgs/Odometry Message. Its probably better if you take a look at the navigation stack

I think this is the answer.
@kenrobinson: 'position of a rover on a map' is typically the result of a localisation algorithm or some (derived) sensor (ie: gps, motion capture). Estimates based on sensors local to the mobile base are typically published usin the Odom msg that @Humpelstilzchen ..

.. refers to. Consuming nodes typically fuse that info with other sources to improve that estimate, and the result is often used in navigation.

Thank you. I'll look at the navigation stack and the Odometry message.
