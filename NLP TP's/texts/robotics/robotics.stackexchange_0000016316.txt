Q:

The Arduino Turns Off After Attaching A Servo Motor

The Arduino turns off when I try to put the wire from the servo to its respective pin (9). Also, I've tried the code from the Arduino IDE, the knob code where the position of the motor depends on the value of the potentiometer. I don't really know what's wrong. Every time the servo tries to turn, the Arduino turns off, so the motor only turn for a very small degree, then the Arduino turns on, and so on.
By the way, I'm using an MG996R Tower Pro Digital Servo motor.
Is there a problem with the motor or/and the Arduino? I can't seem to remedy this problem.

A:

It sounds like you are drawing too much power from the Arduino, and causing it to reset. Try powering your servo from a separate power source.
The Arduino Playground has a useful page on Arduino Pin Current Limitations which you might find helpful if you're designing robots that use Arduinos.

 A summary of the information for the Arduino Uno is given below:

Input Voltage Limits:
Recommended: 7~12V
Absolute: 6~20V
Input/Output (I/O) pins: -0.5V to +5.5V (the actual max is “Vcc +
0.5V,” which for a 5V Arduino, is +5.5V)
Output Current Limits:
When powered by USB: total of 500mA
With external battery or power supply: total of 500mA~1A
5V pin: same as above: 500mA or 500mA~1A
Each input/output pin: 40mA
Sum of all input/output pins combined (but NOT including the “5V”
pin): 200mA
