I tought that was the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH doesn't find the pkg that i'm using, but y export it and nothing is better.

Does rosmake eigen fail due to  Error: package/stack my_controller_pkg depends on non-existent package xxx again?
Comment by monidiaz on 2012-11-07:
Packages requested are: ['eigen']/Logging to directory /home/moni/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20121107-120355 /Expanded args ['eigen'] to: / WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['eigen'] /ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

A:

Your error happened because you don't have "eigen" package installed.
Normally, you can solve this kind of question by getting the source on this page,then rosmake eigen should solve this problem.
But note that eigen has been deprecated since ros-electric, so don't do that. Check the explanation on this page.
