Q:

export more than one ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Hi guys,
I had source my catkin_ws as suggest me in this question:
http://answers.ros.org/question/66084/catkin_make-package-not-found/?answer=66117#post-id-66117

A:

Have you tried extending your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH after sourcing the catkin workspace? Like with:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Thanks for the answer @felix k , I tryed to add that line on my bashrc but without results, soo I added this line:  source /home/master/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash to bashrc and it works. but I don't know if it is the correct way...

Uhm, sourcing that file was exactly the suggestion from Jeremy in that other question, what have you actually done? Anyway, this would be the ideal line for your .bashrc, my export line would only be needed for another or a rosbuild workspace. I don't see what you meant by 'other package'.

Sorry, I mean other rosbuild package like the node for the motor driver.
