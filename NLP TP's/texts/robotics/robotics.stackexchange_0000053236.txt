Q:

Cannot locate node

I have been following the following tutorial : "urdf/Tutorials/Using urdf with robot_state_publisher", but when I run "roslaunch r2d2 r2d2.launch", I have the following error: "cannot locate node of type [r2d2/state_publisher]".
I have to admit that I overlooked the statement "(throughout this example, we assume package name "r2d2" and node name "state_publisher")", so I have no file corresponding to a state_publisher. What's the solution?

A:

You need to have a look at the launch file xml format for node. The line
<node name="state_publisher" pkg="r2d2" type="state_publisher" />
is likely your problem. Change type="state_publisher" to type="<insert your executable name here>"

I use .cpp to write my state_publisher and I change the type="" to type = "state_publisher.cpp" in my launch file, but it still reports
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [r2d2/state_publisher.cpp]: can't locate node [state_publisher.cpp] in package [r2d2]
Please help. Thanks

I'm just seeing your message. In the future, you should ask a new question and link to related questions in your question to get better help. Usually a file with a .cpp extension contains code and a binary will not have an extension. Use whatever the add_executable argument is in your CMakeLists.txt
