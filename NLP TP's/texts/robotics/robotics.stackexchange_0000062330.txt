Q:

How to start project for an autonomous vehicle

Hey,
I think this is not the common way of questions asked here but I just give it a try.
I am working at a project in which a car should autonomous drive in a predefined map and with predefined endposition. This should be solved with the use of ROS and Gazebo (for now i guess it is not that important that it is really a car - it could also be an example robot or whatever).
My problem here is that i can't find a suitable example project to get started with this. So I am pretty unsure how to launch such a project.
For now I am using ROS Indigo and Gazebo 2.2 on Ubuntu 14.04
Can you give me an outline or some examples how you could start with such a project?
BR

A:

The self-driving car team at the University of Texas ran ROS on their self-driving car for quite a while before it was retired in 2013. Most of their work is publicly available and documented on the ROS wiki.

In general, older ROS packages should work with newer versions of ROS. In any case, it's better than starting from scratch.
