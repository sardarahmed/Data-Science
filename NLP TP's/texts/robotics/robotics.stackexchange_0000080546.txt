A:

rostopic_10245_1493704203398 is an anonymous rostopic name. The anonymous means it apprend numbers to the node name so multiple nodes can live at the same time.
Also, rostopic is the tool used to read/write manually on topics.  (rostopic echo, pub,...)

Thank you for your reasonable proposal.So does it mean /rostopic*******(prefixed number) appears whatever node I run and it carries the data being published?
