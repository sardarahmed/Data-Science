Q:

How to detect loop in robot movement observing odometer data

I have some odometer data. This data are based upon robot movement. I can transfer those raw data to a motion equation from where I get  x,y,and theta co-ordinate of a Robot. If I plot those x,y coordinate I get a path which show me robot movement. This path show me that the Robot move back and forth through a corridor. So there is a looping. Now how could I determine from the raw data which consist of forward and angular velocity that in a particular time stamp robot back to its previous position? 
What is residual uncertainty in context of Robotics? 

A:

I think you are thinking in the wrong direction. Loop Closing techniques where invented (and are used) exactly for the reason that you cannot trust your odometry over a longer time. 
Loop closing relies on being able to re-recognize a part of your world so you need a sensor that can sense the environment (e.g. a camera or a laser scanner). Your odometry cannot sense the environment so the robot has no way to know where it is globally.
