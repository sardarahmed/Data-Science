Q:

When ever I try to put my turtlebot2(simulated in gazebo) into a namespace the fake laser stops publishing messages on /scan

I am trying to put multiple turtlebots in my simulation and need to declare group namespaces for this purpose. When defined within the namespace the robot_state_publisher published all the transforms under the new namespace but the fake laser first of all does not follow the namespace the /scan topic remains /scan and 2nd it even stops getting any message at /scan which is working fine without the group namespace declared. Below is my launch file
I want my /scan topic to be published under /robot1/scan so that I could add in multiple robots all publishing their own scans.

A:

There is remapping rule in laserscan_nodelet_manager.
You may want to remove this.
