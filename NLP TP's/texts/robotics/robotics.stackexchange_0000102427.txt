Q:

what type of joint I need if I want to rotate on both x and y axis?

since "revolute" can only rotate on one axis..

A:

As far as I know, that feature is not supported by either ros or gazebo. The closest solution you can get that works in ros is to use two revolute joints connected by a short link.

even though this is a ROS question, for reference, gazebo does support universal joints (e.g. x-y free, z constrained) and ball joints (xyz free), but this is SDF only. for URDF models, you can add concentric revolute/continuous joints as mentioned.
