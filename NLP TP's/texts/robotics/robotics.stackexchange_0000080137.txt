Q:

Is there an alternative way to get rid of ros log files?

Getting the error
WARNING: disk usage in log directory [/home/an/.ros/log] is over 1GB. 
It's recommended that you use the 'rosclean' command.

Well i can rosclean purge and delete all everything or maybe delete using. Is there a way to delete the oldest entries and lighten my log files. It would not be ideal to clean the entire log file.
Also I wonder what happens if I let it accumulate and not clean? I am asking this question without much googling. So excuse me if there is already something clearly written. ROS insights are most welcome. Thanks

Well, you run out of disk space, eventually...
You not googling is obvious, as your question directly relates to http://answers.ros.org/question/229966/does-ros-have-rolling-log-files-ability-to-limit-total-size/ :-)
About your question though:
Of course. However, this requires some manual scripting. IMO, there are two ways.

Write a simple script that you start via cron. You can e.g. use the find tool with the -mtime property to get the last modified time of a file and delete via this.
Use logrotate. However, as the log files typically get "stamped" with the RUN_ID, this will probably also need some fiddeling with the prerotate and postrotate scripts.
