Q:

Whats the best way to use ROS to control motors on a simple robot?

Hello community,
I've started a new ros project called MockBot at home...
The robot contains the following modules:
Simple lowcost homebrew chassis, which can be build from cheap components.
http://192.166.253.145/BLOG/serendipity/uploads/MockBot-Design-Sheet.pdf
Currently the nodes for Kinect, GPS, Audio and motorcontroller are up and running.
What is the next step in ros design to make these components work together ?
I'd like to create a simple discover-world or ant-brain behaviour...
Problem: what do I need to control the motors or what do I need to make the motorcontrol ros-compatible ?
What can be reused from the turtlebot project ?
Current state: both motor subscribers are listening at /servo1 and /servo2 topics.
Thanks for many tips and tricks from the professionals with experience from practice
Cheers
Christian

A:

Control of a mobile base is usually done though a geometry_msgs/Twist message, and the topic is often called "cmd_vel".
