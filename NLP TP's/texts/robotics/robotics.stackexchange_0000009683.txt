Q:

Choosing the right Mecanum wheel

I am part of my college robotics team which is preparing for Robocon 2017.
We have used Mecanum wheels in last Robocon competition, but we have faced huge slip and vibration. I have looked for all kinematic and dynamic formulas and all stuff about Mecanum wheels, but still can't get to a conclusion for my problem.
Video of the problem
The robot is around 25 kg and the Mecanum wheel diameter is about 16 cm with 15 rollers (single type). Please help me why it happened like that!?
Also suggest me what to do now - Should I design a new Mecanum wheel or bring it from market? 
If I should design, what parameters should I consider, and please help me how to design in CAD software like SolidWorks? And then, shall I give it to 3D printing?
If I should buy directly from market, where should I buy?

A:

The problem appears to be that your drive motors are providing too much torque.
In other words, there isn't enough friction between the wheels and the floor to counteract the force that the motors are exerting on the wheels.  To determine whether this is actually the problem, try adding weight to the vehicle (directly above the wheels, if possible); this should balance the forces by increasing the static friction.
Of course, adding weight to your vehicle is not a good long term solution.  The proper fix would be to configure your motor controllers to limit the torque produced by the motors. This might also be expressed as a current limit, depending on your setup.
