Q:

Newer Boost Library Ubuntu 10.04

Hi all!
I am having a little issue linking a newer version of Boost (1.46.1) against ROS Electric in Lucid (10.04).
I have specified the newer version for the ROS environment using.
ROS_BOOST_VERSION=1.46.1

and
ROS_BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local/include/

I have also removed every trace of boost 1.40
However when I try to compile a package.. joy for example.  I get the error:
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libboost_signals.so.1.40.0, needed by 
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_msgs/sensor_msgs/lib/libsensor_msgs.so, 
not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)

Any ideas on what I am doing wrong?

Ok, I tried recompiling from the source.  It again tries to install libboost1.40-all-dev from the in the install script.. Executing script below with cwd=/tmp
{{{
#!/bin/bash
#Packages ['libboost1.40-all-dev']
sudo apt-get install libboost1.40-all-dev
}}} I said no and it stopped installation.

I had previously wiped and reinstalled from the debian.. This of course packaged boost 1.40 because of the lucid install.  Shall I try reinstalling everything again but from source? edit: Do I need to do anything special when compiling from source?

Are you recompiling everything from source? Have you made sure that you have cleaned all packages before rebuilding with the new version of boost?

A:

As Tully said the main fix is to recompile ROS from source (Thanks Tully).
Here are the few things that I did before hand to get it to compile accordingly and stop throwing the errors.  These may not all be necessary.
edit your bashrc to export the following.
#In my case the boost 1.46.1 library was located in /usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" 
#I also wanted to explicitly tell the ROS environment my boost location
export ROS_BOOST_ROOT="/usr/local/"
export ROS_BOOST_VERSION="1.46.1"

I then followed the intructions for compiling from source at ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu/Source
You may also want to preclean any package that you are recompiling.
rosmake --pre-clean

Hope this helps.
