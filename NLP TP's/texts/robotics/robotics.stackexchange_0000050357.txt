Q:

ROS website down?

I'm experiencing problems when going to the ROS website at www.ros.org. I've tested this with three different internet providers and five different devices, all located in Belgium. They all fail to load the webpage, with this error code retrieved from Chromium:
Error 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET): The connection was reset.
However, I am able to ping www.ros.org. Is this issue being experienced anywhere else?
