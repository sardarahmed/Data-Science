Q:

Serialize map in Ros2

Hi,
I am navigating with an omnidirectional agv (ros2 foxy) and I want to use Slam localization mode while doing that. In detail I am using slam_toolbox with online_async mode at the moment.
Is there a tutorial on how to use the serialization service to serialize the map I created while driving. Or whats the command, so I can use this map to localize on?
I used ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f /path/to/mapto save the map but as far as I understand these map files (.yaml and .pgm) aren't meant to localize on. I have to serialize the map to be able to use it with slam_toolbox again because than i get the files: .posegraph and .data right?
Please correct me if this is not correct.
Thanks in advance, have a great day!

A:

The is correct, you need to use the provided serialization services (or rviz tool if you like) to serialize the data for use later in localization or continuing slam sessions.
