Q:

Can't source ROS galactic

I was following the installation steps of ros2 galactic on ubuntu 20.04 according to the ros documentation.
Found here: https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html.
I followed everything all the way up to
# Replace ".bash" with your shell if you're not using bash
# Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh
 source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash

Then i get the error
bash: cd: too many arguments

I currently have absolutely no idea why this is happening, did some searches online and it seems that no one has had this problem before me.

A:

It seems that my alias formatting for an alias i made previously in the bashrc file was wrong.
Solution:
Remove your alias. Close your terminal and open a new terminal. However, if you want to remove the alias on your current terminal you can run as follows
unalias alias-name
