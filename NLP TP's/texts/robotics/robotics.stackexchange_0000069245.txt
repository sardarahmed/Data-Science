Q:

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named

in src there is a package named random_husky_driver including:
CMakeLists.text    package.xml      random_driver.cpp
This is the cmakelists.text:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(random_husky_driver)

## Find catkin macros and libraries
## if COMPONENTS list like find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS xyz)
## is used, also find other catkin packages
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  std_msgs
)

set(random_driver ${random_drivers.cpp})
set(random_driver ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

## System dependencies are found with CMake's conventions
# find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system)

## Uncomment this if the package has a setup.py. This macro ensures
## modules and global scripts declared therein get installed
## See http://ros.org/doc/api/catkin/html/user_guide/setup_dot_py.html
# catkin_python_setup()

################################################
## Declare ROS messages, services and actions ##
################################################

## To declare and build messages, services or actions from within this
## package, follow these steps:
## * Let MSG_DEP_SET be the set of packages whose message types you use in
##   your messages/services/actions (e.g. std_msgs, actionlib_msgs, ...).
## * In the file package.xml:
##   * add a build_depend and a run_depend tag for each package in MSG_DEP_SET
##   * If MSG_DEP_SET isn't empty the following dependencies might have been
##     pulled in transitively but can be declared for certainty nonetheless:
##     * add a build_depend tag for "message_generation"
##     * add a run_depend tag for "message_runtime"
## * In this file (CMakeLists.txt):
##   * add "message_generation" and every package in MSG_DEP_SET to
##     find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS ...)
##   * add "message_runtime" and every package in MSG_DEP_SET to
##     catkin_package(CATKIN_DEPENDS ...)
##   * uncomment the add_*_files sections below as needed
##     and list every .msg/.srv/.action file to be processed
##   * uncomment the generate_messages entry below
##   * add every package in MSG_DEP_SET to generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES ...)

## Generate messages in the 'msg' folder
# add_message_files(
#   FILES
#   Message1.msg
#   Message2.msg
# )

## Generate services in the 'srv' folder
# add_service_files(
#   FILES
#   Service1.srv
#   Service2.srv
# )

When I run catkin_make it gives me no error. BUT MY PROBLEM IS WHEN I RUN rosrun random_husky_driver random_driver I RECEIVE THIS ERROR:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named random_driver below /home/denso/ros101/src/random_husky_driver

I would appreciate it if you help me out.

A:

If this is the full CMakeLists.txt, the problem is simply that you are not building the respective node.
This package actually seems to be a tutorial from Clearpath.
Check the Compiling ... section on how to compile anything.
You need to have the two following lines in there:
add_executable(random_driver random_driver.cpp)
target_link_libraries(random_driver ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

And the two lines with set(...) in your CMakeLists.txt don't make sense.

EDIT:
Two possibilities:

You don't have costmap_2d installed, do with sudo apt-get install ros-DISTRO-costmap-2d and replace DISTRO with whatever ROS version you are using.
You don't configure CMake correctly. Do you have something like find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS costmap_2d <otherpackages>) in your CMakeLists.txt, together with the resepctive include_dirs(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} and target_link_libraries(..) calls? And you need to declare it as a <build_depend> in the package.xml.

If this does not help, please update your question with the respective/new CMakeLists.txt content...

Thank you for your time MIG
