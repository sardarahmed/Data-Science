Q:

Can camera1394 pakcage change the F-stop value of the camera?

Can camera1394 pakcage change the F-stop value of the camera? I have Point Grey Firelfy MV work with camera1394 package. But the depth of field is not deep enough. How can I change it?

A:

The F-stop is a property of the lens, not from the camera. So I do not think it is possible to use the camera1394 to ask or modify the F-stop.
If you want to increase the depth of field, you can change the lens, or close the aperture as much as possible. A smaller aperture means a bigger depth of field, but also means that much less lighting is entering your sensor, so you will have to provide additional light.

Right. The Firefly has a standard CS lens mount. You can adjust the F-stop by hand or swap lenses. But, the DC 1394 standard provides no way for the computer to adjust the F-stop. (It can adjust focus or zoom with some cameras.)
