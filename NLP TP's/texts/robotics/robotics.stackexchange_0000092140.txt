Q:

Is there any danger to using the same tf2_ros buffer across different message queues?

That's the short of it. I have a ROS node with 4 different message queues that service callbacks for 4 separate classes. I'm wondering if I can safely provide the same tf2_ros::Buffer reference to all four of those classes, for use with transforming sensor_msgs and geometry_msgs messages between coordinate frames.

A:

Yes, you can do that. The API is thread safe.
