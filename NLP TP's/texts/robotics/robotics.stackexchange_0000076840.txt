Q:

Any quadrotor simulation package in ROS Kinetic?

Hi, I've been workiing with quadrotor simulation in gazebo and ROS indigo utilizing hector_quadrotor package. Now I have changed my ROS to kinetic and Ubuntu to 16.04.
 However, hector_quadrotor can be no longer utilized due to various compile erros. The main reason I find out is that gazebo 7 no longer support some old APIs which hector_quadrotor calls. I tried to solve these compilation problems but failed.
Could you please tell me some other simulation package available in ROS kinetic with gazebo? Thanks for your advice.

I've updated your question title to mention the fact that you're looking for packages under Kinetic.

A:

I'd totally recommend hector_quadrotor, it has kinetic support and runs on Gazebo.
It works both inside:

or outside:

Good thing is that with the hector stack you can have a wide variety of sensors on board already, and you can even integrate slam with hector_slam.
