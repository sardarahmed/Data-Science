Q:

How can you start gazebo with a non-0 simulated clock time?

Similar to this question: https://answers.ros.org/question/310797/start-gazebo-simulation-with-non-zero-clock-time/
When gazebo starts up it starts its clock at 0, which can cause problems with code that does math on times, i.e. subtracting 10 seconds from a timestamp that is less than 10 epoch seconds will cause an error.
Does gazebo support any mechanism to change the initial clock stamp?

A:

Generally speaking, best practice would be to set the use_sim_time parameter in any ROS nodes that rely on timing in the simulation. Making sure everything is sharing the same clock solves a lot of problems people encounter, so just mentioning that in case it is relevant to you.
If you are dependent on explicit time deltas, I'd encourage value checking on the timestamp or some other error handling before trying to subtract some value from it to handle errors.
All that said, you can start a Gazebo simulation with a given time if you're willing to edit and use a custom .world file. The sdf spec for a <world>s <state> supports a <sim_time> element (see here)
The easiest way to, in my opinion, to generate a valid world file with <state> filled out would be to start your world (without any spawned robots), let gazebo run a few seconds, then save your world. You can then go and tweak the resultant world file to have the desired start time. Then, you can simply load that modified world file when starting Gazebo in the future.
I am not aware of a simpler way to do this (e.g. through the Gazebo ROS launch file), but that's not to say that a better method doesn't exist.
