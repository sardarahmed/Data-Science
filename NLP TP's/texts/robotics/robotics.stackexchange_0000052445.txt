Q:

Difficulty moving from electric to groovy - bullet issues

Hi,
I'm trying to upgrade a system from electric to groovy.  Unfortunately, I'm getting stuck since the codebase uses btQuaternion.
The short version though is, I can't find the migration script mentioned here: http://ros.org/wiki/geometry/bullet_migration
My tf folder has no scripts with that name.  All I have are:
static_transform_publisher
tf_change_notifier
tf_echo
tf_empty_listener
tf_monitor
What happened to the conversion script?  Was it removed?

A:

It's not being installed into groovy.  You can get it directly from the source https://github.com/ros/geometry/blob/groovy-devel/tf/scripts/bullet_migration_sed.py

Is there anything I'll have to do set-up wise other than just running this script?

Change to the directory you want to modify.  It's good practice to make sure you don't have any local changes in your source control so you can check the diff and rollback if it doesn't work as you want.

Okay...it messed up a little bit but with tiny changes it then worked.  Thanks!
