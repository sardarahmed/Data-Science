Q:

Problem with netbeans building ROS package

I am using Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick, install ros electric. I wish to use IDE to develop ros package, so I decided to use netbeans IDE. I have follow the http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs to configure the netbeans, but I fail to build and clean the project. The following is the output from the debug window of the Netbeans.
"/usr/bin/make" -f nbproject/Makefile-Default.mk QMAKE= SUBPROJECTS= .clean-conf
make[1]: Entering directory /home/jun/NetBeansProjects/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu_1' cd /opt/ros/electric/stacks/imu_drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu && /usr/bin/make -f Makefile clean cd: 1: can't cd to build make[2]: [clean] Error 2 (ignored) make[2]: Entering directory /opt/ros/electric/stacks/imu_drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu'
cd build && make clean
rm -rf build
make[2]: Leaving directory /opt/ros/electric/stacks/imu_drivers/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu' make[1]: Leaving directory /home/jun/NetBeansProjects/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu_1'

As @Procópio Silveira Stein suggested, this issue should be rooted in that Netbeans (or whatever process. Basically this issue shouldn't be specific for Netbeans) tries to write to the folder where it doesn't have a permission to do so. See the link if you have no idea for workaround.
