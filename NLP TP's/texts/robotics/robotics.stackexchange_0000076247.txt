Q:

Can't load .ONI device openni2

I have previously saved a .ONI file that contains a recorded depth video. this was done so that the same video could be used for testing purposes. I am however having trouble loading this file to use. I keep ending up with "STATUS_NO_DEVICE" after the open line has been executed as shown here:
Status rc_ = openni::STATUS_OK;     
Device device_;
rc_ = OpenNI::initialize();  
char* fileaddress = "C:\\Users\\James\\DepthRecording1.oni";    
rc_ = device_.open(fileaddress);

As is stated in the OpenNI2 documentation this should be possible.
I have proven that the surrounding code is not an issue, by replacing the file address in the open function with ("openni::ANY_DEVICE") which successfully loads my 3D camera(Orbbec Astra S).
Any Idea of what needs to be added/ changed to be able to load the file?

Suggestion: this question is rather specific to the OpenNI APIs/libs. I could be wrong, but I'd expect you to have a better chance at getting good answers at a forum more geared towards OpenNI development.

A:

You can load oni file directly in this way: roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch device_id:=/path/to/your/file.oni.
If it will not work, please refer here https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni2_launch/issues/26
