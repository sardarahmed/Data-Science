Q:

Autonomous Navigation of a Known Map with TurtleBot

Hello,
I'm following the tutorials on autonomous navigation of a turtlebot:
wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Autonomously%20navigate%20in%20a%20known%20map
So, I run these commands on different terminals:
1- roscore
2- roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
3- roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/AddressToMap
I receive these messages:
([ WARN] [1405632943.683405903]: Waiting on transform from base_footprint to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: [ INFO] [1405632945.899453434]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected
4- roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch --screen
Instead of TurtleBot a white circle appears in rviz, and there are red error signs beside GlobalStatus and RobotModel
My laptop runs Ubuntu 12.04, and ROS Hydro. No real robot is involved, I'm just trying to test the simulated turtlebot on my laptop.
EDIT: For using the turtlebot in simulation mode, the following link helped to solve my problem:

A:

If you don't actually have the real robot the turtlebot_bringup will fail (you can see one of the errors from OpenNI trying to connect to a Kinect device that is not present: [ INFO] [1405632945.899453434]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected
If you want to simulate the turtlebot install the package ros-hydro-turtlebot-simulator

ros-hydro-turtlebot-simulator is already installed on my machine. Should i use a different command than roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch to launch the turtlebot in simulation mode?
