Same issue......I have even installed Libgazebo5-dev ...but same error....Can anybody help on this please?

A:

Which version of gazebo is installed? Find out using gazebo --version. For example, I have gazebo 7.
$ gazebo --version
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 7.7.0
Copyright (C) 2012 Open Source Robotics Foundation.

http://gazebosim.org

You'll need the the dev package for that version of gazebo. For gazebo 7 run sudo apt install libgazebo7-dev.
You can find more information about  setting up a computer to build plugins in the first few sections of this tutorial http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=guided_i5&cat=.

I have solved this problem by following the installation tutorial, and 'sudo' the basic files. Thank you for your help.

Even after installing libgazebo4-dev,  the error remained the same on indigo ros+Gazebo 5

I had the same issue and followed the one liner installation and got it to work:
