Q:

Transform between two occupancy grids

Hi!
Is there a node available that subscribes to 2 occupancy grids (one is static the other one is created by hector_mapping), aligns them and publishes a transform between the two? I tried with mapstitch but the lack of information makes it complicated...
Why do I want that?
I am flying in a partially known environment. Therefore, a static map is used by move_base to compute a global path. In the meantime, I am creating a map with hector_mapping in order to compare it to the static map at the end of the process. Without any link between the two, the drifting between the maps prevent me from navigating after a while.
Thanks for your help

A:

We've made some changes to mapstitch and used it quite successfully at RoboCup 2015 for online stitching of maps between two robots and creating merged maps. The version we used is in the hector_mapstitch branch.
