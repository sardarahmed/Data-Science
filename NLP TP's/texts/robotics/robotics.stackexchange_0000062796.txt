Q:

Linear movement with moveit?

Hello,
I'm using moveit and rviz to move my robot.
Anyone knows how can I define a linear movement?

A:

ROS-Industrial recently released the 'Cartesian Path Planner Plug-In for MoveIt!' for RViz. That would allow you to plan / play / debug Cartesian paths from within RViz, similar to how the MoveIt plugin works.
