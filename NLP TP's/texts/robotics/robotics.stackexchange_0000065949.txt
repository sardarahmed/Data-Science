Q:

[rospack] Error: stack/package stage_ros not found; in ROS Fuerte, Ubuntu 12.04

Hi, all.
I am very new to ROS and Ubuntu. I am working under Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Fuerte. I was trying to make teleop_base tutorial with stage (Simulating one robot). After the teleop_base installation I tried to run:
$ rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack find stage_ros)/world/willow-erratic.world
And I have got this error:
[rospack] Error: stack/package stage_ros not found
[rospack] Error: stack/package stage_ros not found
I was trying to find out how solve it in the internet (I assume, that I need to install stage_ros), but I did not find anything useful. At least anything that I can understand and use (as I am newbie). Please help me!

By running:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-stage
It says that the newest version is already installed on my computer.

I believe the package is named stage in fuerte, so rosrun stage stageros should work.
