Q:

Is there a topic for camera FOV info?

Hi,
I'd like to publish info about the field of view of a camera, but I cannot find a standard topic for this information.
Before creating a custom topic I want to be sure that there is nothing just ready for it.
Thank you
Walter

A:

The information about the camera FOV can be extracted from the camera info message of your camera, so it is kind of redundant to publish the FOV separately.
And to answer your question, there isn't a message for publishing a camera FOV, at least not in the official ROS packages.

Do you mean using those formulas?
fov_x = 2 * atan2( w, (2*f_x) ) and fov_y = 2 * atan2( h, (2*f_y) )

yes something like that.

It will be very helpful if you could add for how to extract FOV from the camera_info message. The first comment doesn't state what each parameter is, and where it is taken from.

W is image width and h is image height in pixels. F_x and f_y are the focal lengths, from the camera matrix K[0][0] and K[1][1]
