Q:

Calibrating turtlebot odometry without gyro/imu

I am using the turtlebot stack to control my Irobot Create + Kinect, but currently do not have a gyro. However, I would like to calibrate the odometry from the Icreate encoders. The turtlebot calibrate routine however requires an imu present: I keep getting the error "Still waiting for imu" when trying to run the calibration routine.
Does anyone know a way to calibrate the Irobot Create odometry without needing the imu present? I've looked into the code of calibrate.py a bit and do not see an easy way of removing the imu dependency..

A:

This is a good point.. I have created a ticket (https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/trac/ticket/52) to make this possible. In the future it will check the has_gyro param. I'll try and get to it this week.

worked on it this weekend, I think I have a working solution I still need to test it before I push it out but I hope to have it out in the next stable release
