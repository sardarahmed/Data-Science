Q:

Where can i find the actor model for ROS Indigo and Gazebo2.2 version?

I want use face_detector package.  To use this package in simulation, i need to create the faces or actors in the gazebo simulator.
Can anyone please help where can i find the actor models for ROS indigo with Gazebo2.2 version.
Or is there any better way to detect and track the faces using face_detector without actor models?
