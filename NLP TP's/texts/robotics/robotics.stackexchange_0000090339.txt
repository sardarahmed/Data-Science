Q:

Invoking "make -j12 -l12" failed trying to catkin_make glog_catkin

Hello ROS Community,
I am currently trying to get the ROS_quadrotor_simulator from Wil Selby running on my machine.
I am following the wiki from his github (https://github.com/wilselby/ROS_quadrotor_simulator).
When i try to run catkin make after I got the glog_catkin and catkin_simple package i get the following error:
Invoking "make -j12 -l12" failed
I am running all this on Ubuntu 18.04 and the ROS melodic distro.
I appreciate any help on that. Thanks alot!
Update - thats the full error i get:
####

I updated the question @jayess

A:

This issue has been reported upstream, but so far no fix has been commited.
However, the solution is also shown in the issue:

The first problem is that in line 15 PATCH_COMMAND patch -p0 < ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/fix-unused-typedef-warning.patch the directory to find fix-unused-typedef-warning.patch is set to ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}, which is ~/test_ws/src/ [in your case], but the file is in ~/catkin_ws/src/glog_catkin/ in your case]. So you should change ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} to ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
