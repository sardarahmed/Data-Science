Q:

ROS2 Galactic rclpy.parameter.Parameter missing floating_point_range and integer_range no longer availabe

Hi all. I started using ROS2 Galactic and realized that the parameters 'floating_point_range' and 'integer_range' for rclpy.parameter.Parameter are now missing, yet the rclcpp does have them.
I searched in the changelog but did not find any entry regarding this. Afaik no question has been posted either.
What is the correct way to enforce the ranges in galactic rclpy?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I found the answer to my own question, leaving here in case someone needs it:
Instead of declaring the ranges in the instantiation of Parameter directly, use a ParameterDescriptor for it.
