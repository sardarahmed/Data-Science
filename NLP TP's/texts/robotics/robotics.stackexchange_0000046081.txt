Q:

Problem wiimote LED- and vibration-feedback

In fuerte the wii's LED and vibration work perfectly, but if I test it on electric, it doesn't work. Any idea what the problem could be and how to fix it?

Do you possibly mean that it worked in Electric, but not in Fuerte? If you compare the electric message api and the fuerte message api.....

.... you'll notice the LEDControl and RumbleControl message definitions disappeared in Fuerte.  I'm not sure why, but they did

A:

jarvis is correct, the API changed from Electric to Fuerte.
In Electric, the WiiMote had its own API.  In Fuerte, this was changed over to use the common API with the PS3 joy node:
http://ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/JoyFeedbackArray.html
For an example of how to use the common API, see here:
http://ros.org/doc/fuerte/api/wiimote/html/feedbackTester_8py_source.html
Just note that the WiiMote only has on/off for each element, so values >= 0.5 are 'ON' while values < 0.5 are 'OFF'.  That script is essentially a unit test to ensure that "analog" inputs are rounded to the correct binary outputs.
