Q:

Drawing poses in a coordinate system in rviz

Hi,
I am developing in a visual SLAM context and would like to draw the resulting camera poses for each keyframe in rviz as coordinate systems(i.e. three arrows), to see how well the localization works. Since I am inexperienced in this issue, could anyone give me an approximate description of how this can be done? Is there a tutorial or a ROS package which already does something similar? And is it necessary to use Tf for this?
Cheers,
Oier

A:

I would recommend to publish 3 Arrow Markers for each pose (see e.g. http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes).
You could also publish a tf frame for each pose, but that will create a lot of computational overhead in the system.
