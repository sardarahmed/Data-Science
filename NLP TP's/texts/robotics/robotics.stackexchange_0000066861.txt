Q:

Ros PCL segmentation for dominant plane

I have a point cloud of floor and wall. When i did segmentation with plane normals, it gave me plane of the wall instead of the floor as intended. However, when i changed the k search number of kd tree, it gives me the plane of the floor.
My question is 'is there anyway to specify which plane I want to segment?' also' I dont quite understand kd tree search. Please help

A:

The solution proposed by Stefan suppose your cloud is expressed in a frame where Z points upwards. If the point cloud is expressed in the camera frame, there is no easy way to make the difference between the floor and a wall without more assumptions. If your camera is pointing to the floor you could choose the plan intersecting the optical axis (Z camera axis).

I wrote a node to capture 1 point cloud to pcd file from the kinect. I dont know if the point cloud is expressed in camera frame or not but I did check the z axis is depth. Can you suggest any method please?

ok. i understand what you said now. however, i want to convert my point cloud in camera optical depth frame to base_link frame. base link is my static tf publisher
