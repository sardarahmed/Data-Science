Q:

Omnidirectional camera (fisheye/wide angle) model support

Hello,
looking at the sensor_msgs/CameraInfo Message and/or at the camera_calibration_parsers it seems that ROS supports only the Pinhole model for cameras (out of the box).
Is there some known way we could use the Scaramuzza model model for omnidirectional cameras?
Currently working under Indigo.
Thanks!

A:

I implemented some tooling for reading ocamlib calibration files  and generating rectified images from fisheye cams as part of our DRC participation here: vigir_wide_angle_image_proc. The rectify  nodelet is also capable of simulating a pinhole camera with two (yaw, pitch) joints and generating appropriate camera_info and joint_states.
That being said, nowadays I'd recommend using the excellent kalibr calibration toolbox which can jointly calibrate multiple cameras with good ROS integration.
