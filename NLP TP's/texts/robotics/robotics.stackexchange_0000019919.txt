Q:

Can I screw directly into the iRobot Create 2 chassis rather than using the mounting holes indicated on the green cover?

Hi I'm trying to mount a few things to the iRobot Create 2 and I wanted to secure it to the robot in a better way than the holes indicated on the green cover! Because once I drill does holes, how am I actually going to secure anything to the cover and not drill into the plastic chassis underneath? Maybe heatsets would work but I hope that's not the solution because the green cover is quite thin. So After tearing the whole thing down a few times, I thought of using the existing screw holes for the chassis. I know that they are meant to be self-tapping plastic screws (thanks iRobot!!!) but I'm pretty sure I found the thread size for them which is No. 4 (https://www.mcmaster.com/99461a140). I just wanted to see if anyone has done this before and what kind of results they got by mounting right to the chassis.

I think you may have answered your own question here, but in case you're looking for reassurance, I don't see any reason why you couldn't use the bosses that already exist; iRobot provides their locations here. I have seen projects where others use them, though I usually use inserts pressed into the cover, or else 3D-print a replacement bin. If you do use the existing bosses, be careful not to strip them, since as you pointed out, they're self-tapping screws. I suppose if you were feeling adventurous, you could take the top cover off and replace some of the bosses with heat set machine screw inserts...
