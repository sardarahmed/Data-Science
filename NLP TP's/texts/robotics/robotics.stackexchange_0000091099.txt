I believe an answer to this question also depends on what "messages present in ROS" actually means.
Which messages?

A:

I checked and to me it looks like all the ROS1 messages are present in ROS2.
Here you can see the ROS standard messages
https://github.com/ros/common_msgs
The ROS2 standard messages on the other hand live here
https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces
Plus some additional navigation messages https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/master/nav2_msgs
