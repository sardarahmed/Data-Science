Q:

What is roswww and how does it relate to Rosbridge?

I was exploring the rosbridge package and noticed a package called roswww. Is that just the package that rosbridge uses for server logic (connection management)?
I haven't been able to find any documentation on roswww..
Can someone point me somewhere for more information, or explain what roswww is / what role it plays in the rosbridge package?
Thanks,
-James

A:

roswww is a deprecated package in Fuerte that was used for serving files with a web server using the ROS file system. That is, when running, you could access files in a ROS package with something like: http://localhost:8080/my_package/launch/mylaunch.launch
In essence, it had no real relationship to rosbridge and hence was removed.
