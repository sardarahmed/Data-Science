Q:

Navigation by kinect, Point Cloud to Laser Scan

Hello,
I would like to navigate a Pioneer 3DX robot by Kinect sensor. It seems, that the simplest way to accomplish my goal is to convert PointCloud msgs to LaserScan msgs. I've launched 3dsensor.launch from turtlebot_bringup package to do the conversion. (ROS - Hydro, Ubuntu 13.10)

The problem is, 3dsensor.launch publishes no msgs on /scan topic.

What should I do next to accomplish navigation and get around obstacles?

Thank you in advance.

did you check your rostopic list after running the launch file ? Does it show "/scan" topic ?
Comment by Wojciech on 2013-11-10:
Yes, but echo /scan is empty. I think the problem is,  http://wiki.ros.org/depthimage_to_laserscan subscribes topics: /image & /camera_info, but openni_launch publishes msgs on /camera/rgb/camera_color & /camera/rgb/camera_info.

A:

There seems to be a pointcloud_to_laserscan stack. Haven't used it myself, but might be worth a try.
Best regards
Christoph

Yes, there is http://wiki.ros.org/depthimage_to_laserscan but it subscribes:
/image & /camera_info, and openni_launch publish msgs on /camera/rgb/camera_color & /camera/rgb/camera_info. Is there simple way to change subscribed topics?

Use topic remapping. see http://wiki.ros.org/Remapping%20Arguments for more info.
