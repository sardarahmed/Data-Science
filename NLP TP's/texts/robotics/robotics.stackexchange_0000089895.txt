Q:

ros2 message documentation?

Dumb question... where's the ROS2 equivalent of http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CameraInfo.html?
Thanks.

A:

That doesn't exist yet. We haven't gotten automated code documentation generation running yet, and the pretty html version of the messages is part of that.
Until then you'll need to just look at the files directly, e.g.:
https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo.msg
There's also the local command ros2 msg show sensor_msgs/CameraInfo.
