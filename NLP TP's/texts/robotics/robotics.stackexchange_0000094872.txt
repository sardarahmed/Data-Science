Hey,
Find_object_2d package is a great way to get into object detection and pick-and-place pipelines. Basically using a find_object_3d node to subscribe to /color and /depth topics and publishing detected objects' properties (such as id, width and length) to /objects topic. The UI is pretty simple and straightforward, you just take a snapshot of the image and make a bounding box for the object in the frame.
The best thing? The node also publishes object coordinate transformation and rotation using tf. You can look up the transformation from the object frame to camera frame and base frame and plan your pipeline from there.
Hope that helps!
