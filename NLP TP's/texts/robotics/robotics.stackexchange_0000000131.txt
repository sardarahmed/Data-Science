Q:

Connecting two microcontrollers using I2C

I Have an ATmega16 mc which is master on the i2c and a ATMega8 mc which is slave on the i2c.
I have connected the two mcs' sda and scl ports to each other alongside a pullup resistor.
Now I want to read a register from the ATMega8 using the ATMega16. 
The problem is that I don't want to assign all the variables manually. Is there any libs or headers that will do this thing for me?

A:

It's been a while since I've used the AVR, but there where two libraries which would do what you are looking for. Unfortunately ATMEL doesn't provide proper firmware libraries themselves (as e.g. STM does).

Procyon AVRlib is quite outdated, but also very lightweight. You can just use the parts that you are interested in.
AVR Libc is another library which is slightly more recent and in my experience quite comprehensive. I think it is actually bundled with a lot of toolchains.

A:

I've not used the ATMega family, but have lots of experience of configuring many other devices - setting up the control registers for I2C is usually pretty straight forward, with appropriate reference to the datasheet/user-manual and will help you understand what's going on.
For such tasks, a library is (a) inefficient (b) overkill and (c) doesn't help you learn. 
I don't know if there is one, but wouldn't recommend you use it, if there was...
