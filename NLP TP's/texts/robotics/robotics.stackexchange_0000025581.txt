Q:

How do I update from the Fuerte Gazebo release to version 1.3

Hi All,
My version of Gazebo came packaged in the Fuerte release of ROS which I believe is 1.0. How do I go about updating it to 1.3. Because in the Gazebo installation tutorials, the ROS users are told not to install from here but are instead directed back to the ROS installation page, which as far as I know only packages Gazebo 1.0?
Is there a way to upgrade gazebo without touching or changing the remainder of my ROS files?
cheers
Peter

A:

I've fixed the gazebosim.org/wiki/install instructions. You should only install Gazebo from the OSRF repository. It will not touch your ROS files, and you will still be able to use ROS with Gazebo.
