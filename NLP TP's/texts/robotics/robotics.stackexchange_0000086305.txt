Q:

Read a msg inside a bagfile

In the rosbag/Code API, we could see the msg by:
 import rosbag
 bag = rosbag.Bag('test.bag')
 for topic, msg, t in bag.read_messages(topics=['chatter', 'numbers']):
     print msg
 bag.close()

When I try this, I see several msg entries. How could I select only one of entries to display?

Like, for example. How could I get the data vector only?

Please don't use an image to display text. Images are not searchable and people cannot copy and paste them.

A:

Instead of printing the whole message with print msg, do print msg.data or whichever field or fields you're interested in.
