Short answer: no, Hydro can only be installed on Ubuntu versions 12.04 (Precise), 12.10 (Quantal) and 13.04 (Raring).

As to whether you can read a book for Hydro while using Indigo: @Wolf's answer is correct: there is not too much difference between the two, but you will run into some (minor) changes that you'll have to account for. At the very least you'll have to replace every occurrence of hydro in (pkg names fi) with indigo.

+1 for noticing the correct ubuntu version, Ã³f course my response does only apply if OS version is not specified;)
