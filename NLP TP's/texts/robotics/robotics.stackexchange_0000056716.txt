Q:

global_planner is not registered

I am trying to use the global_planner, I added it in move_base parameters as
base_global_planner: global_planner/PlannerCore

but it keeps saying this planner is not registered. Is there a special way to register it?

These are the errors:
Using the deb (/opt/ros/hydro/share/global_planner)
[FATAL] [1390401478.753618530, 223.054000000]: Failed to create the global_planner/PlannerCore planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class global_planner/PlannerCore with base class type nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner does not exist. Declared types are  SBPLLatticePlanner carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner goal_passer/GoalPasser iri_bspline_navfn/NavfnROS navfn/NavfnROS

If I try using an overlay (catkin_ws/navigation/global_planner)
[FATAL] [1390401282.627051354, 30.763000000]: Failed to create the global_planner/PlannerCore planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: MultiLibraryClassLoader: Could not create object of class type global_planner::PlannerCore as no factory exists for it. Make sure that the library exists and was explicitly loaded through MultiLibraryClassLoader::loadLibrary()
