Q:

Support Motoman Yaskawa gp-7 model

Created a package for the new robot to the driver motoman_driver. Uploaded INIT_ROS.JBI and MotoROSYRC1000.out in the robot controller. When you connect ROS to the controller, you receive the error message Failed to find parameter topic_list.
When trying to convey the position of the robot via actionlib get the same error message the Joint trajectory action failing on invalid joint and nothing happens.
What am I doing wrong?
[ERROR] [1506939087.527665396]: Failed to find topic_list parameter
[ERROR] [1506939087.537058139]: Failed to find topic_list parameter
[ERROR] [1506939092.711826118]: Joint trajectory action failing on invalid joint

If you run the test script move_to_joint.py from motoman_driver occurs transmission error Unable to move to commanded position. Aborting.

Please do not post screenshots for what is essentially text. Copy-paste the console output into your question, select it and press the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it), or ctrl+k.
Thanks.

And please: in case of errors and warnings, include some of the lines above and below (if any) the error/warning text. Without context things are hard to diagnose.

A:

Created a package for the new robot to the driver motoman_driver.

I'm not sure I understand completely what you mean with this, but from the error you quote it would appear that the configuration on the ROS side is incomplete.
It's underdocumented (and I've logged ros-industrial/motoman#180 because of that), but for a single group robot, you should set the controller_joint_names parameter. This is mentioned in the Using the Motoman FS/DX ROS Interface tutorial, in the Joint Naming section.
As an example, see the joint_names_mh5.yaml file in the motoman_mh5_support package. Such a yaml file typically gets loaded by the launch file that launches the driver launch file (such as launch/robot_interface_streaming_mh5.launch).

Note that for multi-group setups the procedure (and configuration) is slightly different: Creating a Dual-Arm System.

I changed controller_joint_names to ['joint_s', 'joint_l', 'joint_u', 'joint_r', 'joint_b', 'joint_t']
by analogy with motoman_mh5

And did you get it to work with that?

Yes, it works, thanks for the help!
