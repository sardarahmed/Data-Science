Q:

Is it possible to use Google Cartographer with ROS Noetic?

Is it possible to use Google Cartographer with ROS Noetic? In Melodic this all seemed to available out of the box but in Noetic this does not seem to be the case. The installation instructions here also seem to be outdated. Could anyone confirm this please?

A:

Yes it is, because the repo
https://github.com/cartographer-project/cartographer_ros
Contains an ros Neotic Docker file.
You May can it read as an instruction how to compile

Ok so are you suggesting that I should run it through Docker or manually translate the instructions in the Docker file to terminal commands to do the install?
