Q:

Discover system dependencies for a workspace

Is there a clever way to recover all system dependencies for the set of packages in a workspace?  Something like rosdep resolve, but that works on ROS packages in a catkin workspace?

On a clean system rosdep check --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src would show this. But not on a system that has everything already installed unfortunately.

A:

You can use the simulate option to rosdep install.
