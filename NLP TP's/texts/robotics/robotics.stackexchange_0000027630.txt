Q:

Bounding Box not updated

Hi,
I use the function GetCollisionBoundingBox() on a box model to get the minimun corner of this box (green point). From this point I compute two new points to grab the box with a robotic arm. This method works well as long as the box doesn't move. Then, if the box is moved, the min corner of the bounding is not correct anymore. You can see on the picture below what is happening.

Dou you have an idea why this happens ? Does anyone know how the bounding box of an object is updated (I use ODE) ?
Thx
