Q:

Vehicle plugin without control

Hi
I have designed simple model of car with ackermann steering. Also I have designed ackermann plugin to control the model. However, the model and plugin don't work in the new version Gazebo (1.3).
I tried to find a similar model of car for the newest version Gazebo.
I have found model of car what I was looking for.
However, I was surprised that vehicle plugin for this car model don't contain subscriber of control topic. In fact, there is subscriber on cmd_vel topic, but it is empty.
void VehiclePlugin::OnVelMsg(ConstPosePtr &/*_msg*/)
{
}

There are plans to further develop the plugin?
PS. I could develop the plugin by myself. But I would like know if somebody are doing this work too.
Best Regards,
Alex
