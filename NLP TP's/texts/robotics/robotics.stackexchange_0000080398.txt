Q:

create moving obstacles in stage simulator

Hi,
I am currently working on a project that needs to test a path planning algorithm in a environment with moving obstacles. I am wondering is there any way to create a obstacle in stage that could do some random movements?
Thanks!

A:

Stage has some support for built-in controllers. There is a randomly-wandering controller included. You can use this to create moving obstacles by adding additional robots that are controlled by the wander controller (or your own controller, if you want a different type of motion).
http://wiki.ros.org/stage/Tutorials/IntroductiontoStageControllers
If you can't use the inbuilt wander controller, an alternative is to add multiple robots to stage and control them using a ROS node that makes them wander in the way you want. This github repository has samples for using multiple robots in Stage.
https://github.com/gergia/multiple_turtlebots_stage_amcl
Your wander node could either use a map and the navigation stack to randomly set goals (like this old package, or it could be a simple ranger-based movement that moves randomly while not running into things.

I have looked into it. But the tutorial is for ROS electric and I tried on kinetic but it doesn't seem working now. Is there any difference when installing the stage_controller into ROS kinetic?

The tutorial is for Electric but the wander controller is still included in Kinetic. Unfortunately it appears that stage_ros has a bug that makes the controller ineffective: https://github.com/ros-simulation/stage_ros/issues/32
You need to comment out that line to use the wander controller.
