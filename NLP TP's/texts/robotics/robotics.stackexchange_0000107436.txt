Q:

Mobile robot moves sideways in Rviz, but properly in gazebo

I am currently simulating a mobile robot, and I control its movements using the teleop keyboard node. Upon loading the robot model in both Gazebo and Rviz, the initial orientation appears consistent in both environments. However, when I initiate movement, I encounter a discrepancy in behavior.
In Gazebo, the robot moves along the y-axis, aligning with the expected motion based on wheel rotation. However, in Rviz, as I start moving the robot, it unexpectedly moves along the axis, which is the axis of rotation of the wheels.
Here are images illustrating the issue:

As you can see, robot moves along the y axis in Gazebo, whereas it moves along x axis in Rviz. There was a similar question previously,Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the specific changes needed in the URDF from that answer.

A:

Reading your answer and previously mentioned answer it seems that you have to rotate some elements.
According to REP103 front of the mobile robot should be aligned with X-axis. So to fix it, you have to change the rotation in your URDF file. If you have all joint attached to base_link (all joint have <parent link="base_link"> inside <joint>...</joint>, ) you have to add rotation in <joint> markers as
rpy ="0 0 1.57" instead of rpy ="0 0 0" which you probably have now. But without knowing the urdf file it's difficult to say if you need some other changes. But that's the start.
