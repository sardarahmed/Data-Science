Q:

drcsim-nightly/sandia-hand-nightly dependency bug

When I try to install drcsim-nightly using

sudo apt-get install drcsim-nightly

having already installed gazebo-nightly and sandia-hand-nightly,
I get the following error message:

...
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 drcsim-nightly : Depends: sandia-hand-nightly (>= 5.1.10) but 5.1.10~hg20130325rb995efea5e65-1~precise is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Looks like the system can't figure out that version
5.1.10~hg20130325rb995efea5e65-1~precise is >= 5.1.10
Any suggestions?
Chris

Just tried, happens for me too.

A:

This is a bug in versioning for drcsim nightly releases.
Debian versioning policy (and Ubuntu) considers 5.1.10 greater than 5.1.10~hgxxx so the system is complaining about now having a valid sandia-hand >=5.1.10 version.
A fix is already in the repo and should make tomorrow nightly build to not suffer from this error.
Workaround:
Download manually drcsim-nightly package from gazebosim.org and install it ignoring sandia-hand dependency:

sudo apt-get install sandia-hand-nightly # to be sure of have it installed

sudo dpkg -i --ignore-depends=sandia-hand-nightly drcsim-nightly_*.deb

Has anyone gotten nightly build to work since this fix?  Both times I tried it screwed up the install, and had to spend time cleaning up to re-install release version.

Working for me. Install gazebo-nightly, then sandia-hand-nightly (which installs osrf-common-nightly), then drcsim-nightly
Comment by Jose Luis Rivero on 2013-04-01:
For my system (precise with amd64) without any OSRF related package, an apt-get install drcsim-nightly is enough (it will pull gazebo, osrf-common, sandia-hand and drcsim). All fails can be consider bugs and reported in drcsim-release bitbucket repository.

Do you need to remove the current release installs prior to installing nightly?
Comment by cga on 2013-04-01:
Installing xxx-nightly automatically "uninstalls" xxx. I don't know if manually uninstalling xxx and then installing xxx-nightly is an approved procedure.

By the way, you can't mix drcsim/gazebo installations using apt-get and those where you compile source. Unless you intervene, apt-get installations install to /usr/share, bin, include, lib while compiling by source installs to /usr/local/share, bin, include, lib. Unless you are very careful with your $PATH, these two installations interfere with each other. So no compiling by source if you want to use the nightly versions.
