Q:

12 volt input to 5 volt ouput of Arduino

I accidentally ended up supplying 12 v to the Arduino 5v output pin instead of the Vin pin. Does that mean that I can't use the 5v output pin anymore i.e. its fried?

A:

Nobody can tell how much magic smoke is still in the device. You need a magic smoke detector (rarely also referred to as a "voltmeter"), hook one of its contacts up to the pin that should have 5 volts of smoke come out of it and the other to ground. If the detector says there are still 5v, you are probably in luck.
