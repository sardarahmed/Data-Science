Q:

Is it a requirement to use the image for Raspberry PI linked from the Turtlebot e-manual?

I am using a Turtlebot 3 Burger with a Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB RAM). I see the Turtlebot e-maual provides the link to a specific Ubuntu image for Foxy that I could use. Could I just use an Ubuntu Server image for the Raspberry Pi instead, downloaded from Canonical, and then install and configure ROS2 Foxy myself? Or is it necessary to use the ready-made image recommended in the Turtlebot e-manual?

A:

You can use Ubuntu installed yourself if you prefer. However you will need to get and install the ROS software used to communicate with the Turtlebot hardware.
