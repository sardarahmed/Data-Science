Q:

Rviz receives LaserScan messages but doesn't display them

Hi there
I made a dummy package that is publishing fake laser scan messages (following this code: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Sensors#Writing_Code_to_Publish_a_LaserScan_Message ).
I use this command to launch my package:
roslaunch beginner_tutorials fakeLaserScan.launch

Then, I try to display it with:
rosrun rviz rviz

Finally,  I use this command in order to avoid fixed-frame related errors,:
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 map fake_laser_frame 10

I set global_frame as "fake_laser_frame" and I add the topic /fakeScan (type LaserScan).
Everything seems to work great, only green checks and I can see the number of receives messages increase.
But I don't see my laser scan displayed ! I tried with a kinect and package "laserscan_kinect", it works.
What am I missing ?
More info:
What I'm trying to do : for the moment, juste learning really. My final is goal to use a Lidar Lite v3 to generate Laser Scan messages.
My code: https://github.com/erenaud3/fakeLaserScan

For debugging, maybe you can try and see output of rostopic echo /fakeScan to check what values are actually being published.

Hi Erenaud, I prepared a video explaining what could be your problem, but you figured it out before I published. Anyway, here it is just in case it helps you understand some basic ROS concepts.

After a short time count> 100, but "range_max = 100". And rviz not show it data.
You must restart the node, after the configured rviz and can seet data shot time.
Or set big limat for range_max or set limit for ranges [i] and intensities [i] less then range_max.

Okay, I don't know if it's because I restarted my computer or my eyes were too tired yesterday, but my code is in deed working ! The contrast between background and Laser Scan point is very poor but everything is well displayed.
