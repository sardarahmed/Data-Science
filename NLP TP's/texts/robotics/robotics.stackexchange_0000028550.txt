Q:

Why is there a difference between functions of Link Class Reference and gazebo::physics::Link Class Reference?

Gazebo Version: 7.13.1 Ubuntu 16.04
 Class Links :
 Link Class Reference

gazebo::physics::Link
For example, to get absolute pose of a model, function in Link Class Reference is WorldPose and in gazebo::physics::Link is GetWorldPose. Moreover datatype of poses returned by Link Class and gazebo::physics::Link are different. One is ignition::math::Pose3d and other is math::Pose. Why is there such difference ?
How to overcome this ? For example, how to convert math::Pose to ignition::math::Pose3d ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

As detailed on the Migration guide From Gazebo 7 to Gazebo 8, function
inline virtual const math::Pose Entity::GetWorldPose() const
was replaced with
inline virtual const ignition::math::Pose3d &Entity::WorldPose() const
When looking through the API documentation, be sure to go check if the documentation's version matches your Gazebo version. For Gazebo 7, this is the page you should be looking at.

As for converting between  gazebo::math and ignition::math
ignition::math::Something ignSmth = gzSmth.Ign();
gazebo::math::Something gzSmth(ignSmth);
