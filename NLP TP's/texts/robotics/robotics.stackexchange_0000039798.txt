Q:

ROS fuerte wifi support?

Where can I find info about what is actually implemented in ROS fuerte from this list:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Planning/IPC/WiFiNeeds
Especially a network-monitor would be interesting for me (I'd like to scan for networks + log the signal strength etc.).

A:

That page is looking at how to make ROS work over lossy links, without worrying about the underlying implementation.
I think you're really looking for http://ros.org/wiki/linux_networking and the wpa_supplicant_node package. The documentation is pretty thin, but you should be able to figure it out.
