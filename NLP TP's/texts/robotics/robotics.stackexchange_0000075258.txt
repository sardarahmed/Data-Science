Q:

What are the units of IMU data?

I'm trying to publish IMU data in ROS vis the IMU message type, but the documentation seems incomplete. What are the units for each field? For example, is angular_velocity in radians or degrees?

A:

All messages that contain fields that represent a measurement of a physical quantity (should) always use SI units for those fields. That is certainly true for all core message sets. REP-103 documents this. We can't guarantee that every author of every non-standard / non-core message pkg adhered to this requirement though. The IMU msgs do however.
In the case of sensor_msgs/Imu, it's also stated in the comments in the .msg file itself (second line of the comments in the file that you linked):

Accelerations should be in m/s^2 (not in g's), and rotational velocity should be in rad/sec

Note also that the orientation field is a quaternion, not a RPYx quartet.
