Q:

Visible sensor ray in Citadel

How do you get the green cone like this picture:

I can't find it in my Citadel. Is it a feature for Fortess only?

Ah, gotcha! So are you saying that those features are not available on Citadel at all? :(
I'm hoping to use version with a good LTS.
Edfirce will ends in 2022 while Citadel will ends in 2024.
