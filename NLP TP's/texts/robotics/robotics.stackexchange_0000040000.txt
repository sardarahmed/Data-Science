Did you run 'sudo apt-get update' before trying to install ros-fuerte-pr2-desktop?
Comment by mcevoyandy on 2012-04-28:
yeah, I installed ros-fuerte-desktop-full to get going... when I check my software list (in synaptic package manager), I see other pr2 related packages, but not desktop.

A:

There are a few packages in the pr2-desktop variant which fail to build on oneiric.  For now you will have to install the individual packages.  The pr2 variants are listed in REP 108
