You either program it or find someone who has... I haven't seen anything around, though.

A:

Hi, I use http://code.google.com/p/fuzzylite/ for my own project where I need to implement a fuzzy controller for collision avoidance. This library is fairly easy to use and only relies on STL, so it's also easy to install. See main.cpp in the src folder for a simple example on how it works. It's not specifically for ROS though, but ROS supports the use of third party libraries. Just link the library to your executable using target_link_libraries in the CMakelists of your project. As far as I know, there is no ROS package dedicated to fuzzy logic.
