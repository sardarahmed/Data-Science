Q:

Mixing ROS message versions

If I have a robot (Baxter) with an older version of a ROS message (say, control_msgs from Groovy), can I build the latest version (Indigo) in my local user's workspace on the robot and use that message instead?
By this I mean I source /opt/ros/groovy/source.devel and I have the old version of control_msgs
But then I build that message again in ~/catkin_ws/src/control_msgs and source that workspace, I should no longer have issues with nodes built in my catkin_ws that need the newer version of the message, right?
In my testing, however, this does not work, so obviously roscore is tricker than this.
Thanks!

A:

I figured out my issue - it was really simple. I was building control_msgs from source but forgot to build trajectory_msgs from source, which is part of common_msgs which control_msgs depended on. Once I did that the md5 sum matched.
