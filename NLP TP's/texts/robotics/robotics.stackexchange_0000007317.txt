Q:

Vacuum Lifter: Moving Playing Cards

I'd like to buy a small Vacuum Lifter so that I can move playing cards around with robotics. But my "google-fu" is failing me. I don't really know what search terms to look for... or what webpages to look to find this kind of component.
In essence, I want an electronic version of a Vacuum Pen.
I don't really know where to search for this kind of component. I've found pneumatic valves and other complicated machinery... but ideally I'd want a self-contained electronic vacuum pen. Since I'm only planning to move playing cards around.
Anyone have an idea where to look for something like this? Thanks.

A:

Vacuum gripper - I think. Perhaps something like the lynxmotion version, which generates the vacuum with a motorised syringe:

Alternatively - a flat electrostatic gripper can be used for paper handling but it involves a high voltage on one side of a plate, covered by a thin plastic sheet.  A bit of research would be needed to get one working though:
