Q:

Autonomous Navigation of ROS through rviz

I am new to ROS. So, I have some simple doubts.
1. If multiple goals is set through rviz window, then which goal Robot will take to move?
2.If 2D Pose Estimate button doesn't work properly, then will the 2D Nav Goal somehow manage to move towards the goal?
3. After starting the autonomous navigation, can the teleop operation be started again? Is there any procedure?
4. What should global_frame and robot_base_frame for local_costmap_params.yaml and global_costmap_params.yaml?
Thanks for your time.

Hi, I am not an expert, but this is what I think from my experience so far:
1) In rviz I think you can only set one goal at a time. If your robot is navigating and you use the 2D Navigation button again, your robot will forget what it was doing and navigate to the new goal.
2) I have never tried this, but I imagine if the initial pose is far off it would be difficult for the robot to localize itself.
3) By autonomous navigation, do you mean this tutorial?
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Autonomously%20navigate%20in%20a%20known%20map
The tutorial includes this paragraph:

Teleoperation

The teleoperation can be run
simultaneously with the navigation
stack. It will override the autonomous
behavior if commands are being sent.
It is often a good idea to teleoperate
the robot after seeding the
localization to make sure it converges
to a good estimate of the position.

So I believe you should be able to run both simultaneously. If you're doing the autonomous tutorial you should already have your robot booted up, so I would think all you need to do is open a new terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type in roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
(I don't know what robot you're using. I am using a Turtlebot, so that is the teleop command for it)
4)
For local_costmap_params,
global_frame: /odom   
robot_base_frame: /base_footprint

For global_costmap_params,
   global_frame: /map
   robot_base_frame: /base_footprint

I hope this helps!

Thanks @BlitherPants.
For 2 do you have any concrete reason?
By autonomous navigation, I am referring to the scenario where move_base, amcl and rviz are used to move a robot to a particular goal.

For 2 I don't have a strong answer for you since I usually do autonomous navigation of an unknown map (gmapping instead of AMCL). I ran AMCLwhen I was going through the whole tutorial but never tried to put a wrong initial pose. I can try it later but I don't have the robot with me now, sorry...
