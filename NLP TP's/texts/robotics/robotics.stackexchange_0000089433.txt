Q:

Gmapping Error : No map received

Hey!
I am attempting to implement gmapping into my gazebo rover simulation.
I am receiving laserscan data fine , however when starting gmapping node I am not getting any map building in rviz.
I am also getting an additional warning : "No map received"
My tf tree seems fine at:  map > odom > base_link > ...
I am new to ROS, I believe there might be an issue with the transforms?
Here are pictures of my system:

This is not enough information to help you. Please provide details on where the warning is coming from (I'm guessing rviz?), as well as the output of rosrun tf view_frames (or equivalent).

Not a whole lot of info in the question. You say you are "receiving laserscan data fine", so I would start there. With all your nodes running do rostopic info /your_laserscan_data_topic. If the mapping node is not listed as a subscriber you need to remap the topic in the mapping launch file.

I am very sorry for low detail, the website wasn't letting me post pictures due to being a new account.

I have attached pictures of issue as well as the rostopic info ...
I do seem to have my gmapping node subscribing to laser scan.
thank you!!

most of the interesting output in the images (except of the rviz image) is just terminal output. You coudl have copy'n'pasted that into your question (obviously, formatting it as code with the button showing 010101)

A:

Judging from the images you posted, gmapping is subscribing to /dd_robot/laser/scan.
BUT there is no publisher on this topic. Thus gmapping does not get a scan. Doublecheck what you subscribe to in rviz to actually get the scan.

Thank you!! I reevaluated my gmapping launch file, and my hokuyo laser gazebo plugin.
Turns out the gazebo plugin was publishing to robot/laser/scan while my gmapping was subscribing to dd_robot/laser/scan.
