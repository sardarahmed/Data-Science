A:

You may use stereo_sequence_publisher.py from bag_tools package to stream left/right images with their corresponding camera_info on ROS. There is an example here with rtabmap and some stereo images: https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/wiki/Stereo-mapping#process-a-directory-of-stereo-images-in-ros
