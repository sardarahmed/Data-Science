Q:

Problem getting real-time_map using hector_slam!

'Hello all,
I am using Xbox360, Ros Kinetic, Ubuntu 16.04LTS
I am new to ROS. I want to map an unknown enviroment using kinect. For this I am using freenect and gmapping.
I have done these steps:

roslaunch freenect_launch  freenect.launch
rosrun pointcloud_to_laserscan pointcloud_to_laserscan_node cloud_in:=/camera/depth/points
rosbag record -O mybag /scan
rostopic echo /scan          /////////i can see scan data is available here
rqt_graph

here is my MY RQT_GRAPH and here is MY FRAMES.PDF
This is all great.
But the problem is getting data from the bag file

roscore
rosparam set use_sim_time true
roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch scan:=/base_scan
rosbag play --clock mybag.bag
rqt_graph

here is my MY RQT_GRAPH and here is MY FRAMES.PDF
I can't see any error in RViz. But I can't see the map either.
The terminal where I launch hector_slam shows the error that
[ WARN] [1515990267.492285826]: No transform between frames /map and scanmatcher_frame available after 20.002855 seconds of waiting. This warning only prints once.
[ INFO] [1515990270.173023564]: lookupTransform base_footprint to camera_depth_optical_frame timed out. Could not transform laser scan into base_frame.

rostopic pub syscommand std_msgs/String "savegeotiff"

but the terminal in which tutorial.launch is running stated that
[ INFO] [1515995399.174200553]: HectorSM sysMsgCallback, msg contents: savegeotiff 
[ INFO] [1515995399.174327483]: HectorSM Map service called
[ INFO] [1515995399.194847114]: GeotiffNode: Map service called successfully
[ INFO] [1515995399.222169236]: Cannot determine map extends!
[ INFO] [1515995399.222222911]: Couldn't set map transform

I HAVE ALSO RUN rosrun tf view_frames AND I NOTICED THAT world  IS NOT CONNECTED TO base_frame
can anyone help me  with   this
please do post a comment if any other specifications required.
Thank you in advance.....

Lookuptransform Data _______cannot publish transform...............or something like........... no connection between base_frame

I highly doubt that this is the actual error that you're getting. Please update your question with a copy and paste of the actual error message from the terminal.

@NAGALLA DEEPAK: is your caps lock and/or / key broken?

Thank you @gvdhoorn for all the struggle you have taken to edit my question. There isn't any problem with my keys but I  have typed like that only to highlight important  things.

Could some one give solution  to my question?
It is very urgent.

@NAGALLA DEEPAK we all have deadlines. It's not like people aren't answering because they don't want to. Perhaps no one who has seen your question has time to answer it (giving good answers takes a lot of time) or knows the solution. http://wiki.ros.org/Support#Etiquette

I haven't used hextor_slam but it looks like you have a problem with your network. Are you using a simulator or a physical robot?
Comment by NAGALLA DEEPAK on 2018-01-19:
Sorry for the earlier post.
Comment by NAGALLA DEEPAK on 2018-01-19:
I only have a kinect and no robot. I have read that hector slam does not transform data
Comment by sai on 2018-01-26:
Try this command----       rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 base_frame world
Comment by NAGALLA DEEPAK on 2018-01-26:
I have tried the command and got this https://drive.google.com/open?id=188nGPpFR-59_4Bd7rHJo_NNa2cSJCRSk yes there is some change in the frames. But a new frame 1 is being added to the frames.pdf but I think base_frame should be connected to world and not to the "1"

A:

Hello all,
After going through different tutorials, and through the help of some people, I am able to produce the map.
For this I have established the TF between different frames manually.
By this command
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 nav base_footprint 100

in the terminal.
Also used the above line to connect ( base_footprint and base_frame) also ( laser and camera_link ).
This way I am able to produce the real time map.
Thanks to all who has helped me in getting this work done.
