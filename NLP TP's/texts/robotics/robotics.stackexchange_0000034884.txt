Q:

rosserial - Arduino Uno vs Duemilanove Serial_node

Hello,
Normally i use arduino duemilanove for some research projects and it never caused any problems on the serial connection using the serial_node, but when i use the same code on the arduino uno, i always get the error: "Lost sync with device". But when i push the reset button on the arduino uno board, the serial_node connection is established.
Should i have to setup something on the arduino uno, to solve this problem ? am i missing something?
Serial port:
Arduino Duemilanove -> /dev/ttyUSB0
Arduino UNO         -> /dev/ttyACM0
Best regards.

It's worth noting that the Duemilanove uses an FTDI chip for USB-Serial, while the Uno uses an Atmega8U2 programmed to be a USB-serial converter.

We solved this one offline, I'm posting the solution here for future reference:
We applied a patch to work with Unos (which have a slower start up time), but it was after the 0.1.0 release. If you are using an Arduino Uno, please use a source checkout of 0.2.0 (debs will be released shortly).

Hey, I'm having a similar problem and am interested in your solution - could you elaborate on the steps to fix this?

I honestly don't even recall, as this was 2yrs ago, perhaps take a look at the commit history for rosserial around that time.
