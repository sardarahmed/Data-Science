Q:

Odd Field "dip" in gps_common::GPSFix message type

I've been assessing whether this message type is appropriate for use with my Novatel GPS + IMU system, but raised an eyebrow when "dip" followed "pitch" and "roll". Where's yaw? Is this just a typo?

A:

I'm not 100% sure, but I believe dip refers to this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_angle
For yaw, I think you're looking for "track"
