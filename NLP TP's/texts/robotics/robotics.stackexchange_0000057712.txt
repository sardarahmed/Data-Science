Q:

Example of closed kinematic chains in URDF - gazebo

Where can I find an example of a closed-kinematic-chained robot description (in URDF) to be simulated in gazebo?

A:

Closed kinamtic chains can not be described by URDF. You have to 'open up' your structure and take care about the constraints using software code that provides the joint coordinates.
Gazebo supports closed chains through SDF:
