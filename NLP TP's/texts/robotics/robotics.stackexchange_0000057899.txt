Q:

Beginner: How do I run my package in other machine?

Hello,
I have a package that I'm developing in my computer using catkin workspace. To test some network issues, I need run a node from this package in other machines. I read the tutorial "Running ROS across multiple machines" but I don't know how deploy or copy my package to the remote machine. The tutorial uses a "pre-instaled" package (rospy_tutorials). I think it's a common task and should be simple to do.
Thanks
