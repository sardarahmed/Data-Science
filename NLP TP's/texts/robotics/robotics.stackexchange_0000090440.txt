Q:

ROS nav stack with google cartographer pure localization

Hello all!
I am new to this so please forgive if the question is silly. I am trying to integrate Google cartographer with the ros nav stack and doing a few sanity checks. The cartographer gives out heading angle in the format 0 to 180/-180. Is it possible to find out if the ros nav stack accepts heading data in the same format or in 0 to 360 format?
Thanks in advance!

I think your best bet is to just test it! Localization is just setting the updated map -> odom frame transform when run so the actual location of the robot isnt all that important if you're just trying to replace AMCL.

ROS represents rotations as quaternions (not euler angles), so there isn't any confusion about wrapping either.
