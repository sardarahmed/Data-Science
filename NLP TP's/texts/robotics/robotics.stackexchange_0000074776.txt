Q:

How to get global pose of a specific model's link in a gazebo world?

How do I get exact pose of a specific link of a model in Gazebo simulated world? To get model's (i.e. base_link) global position I call rosservice call gazebo/get_model_state '{model_name: my_model_name} but what I really need is a global pose of my lidar's link.

A:

You can get a list of gazebo links and their states from /gazebo/link_states topic.
Here is a python script that republishes poses in geometry_msgs/Pose format. You can find the names of links either in Gazebo GUI or on /gazebo/link_states topic itself.
