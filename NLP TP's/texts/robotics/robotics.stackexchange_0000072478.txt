I'm also having an issue with this. Adding the code snippet found in the github readme to the "xacro-macro-magic" URDF which I assume is turtlebot_library.urdf.xacro doesn't make the turtlebot + arm appear in rviz when roslaunch turtlebot_arm_moveit_config turtlebot_arm_moveit.launch is run

A:

Take a look at the turtlebot arm installation tutorial, section 1.5 "Add your arm to your turtlebot". As explained there, you need to add a turtlebot_arm macro to your URDF, and set origin for the arm base relative to the base_link of your robot.
UPDATE
Here is an example of how to integrate the turtlebot  arm in a robot: attach a white and black arm  at <0.10914 0.0295 0.0284> relative to the plate_top_link; use standard turtlebot_gripper. If you have instead a pincher_gripper, flip the true/false in the _gripper parameters.
UPDATE2
Here's  the example of the previous link:
 <turtlebot_arm parent="plate_top_link" color="White" gripper_color="Black"
                pincher_gripper="false" turtlebot_gripper="true">
   <origin xyz="0.10914 0.0295 0.0284"/>
 </turtlebot_arm>

either pincher_gripper or turtlebot_gripper must be true. For the rotation, as you can see attribute rpy is missing, so the arm should appear with default alignment, if all the joints are set to 0. You can set a different orientation adding
rpy="${M_PI/2} 0.0 0.0"

to origin for a 90 degrees rotation. Can you post a picture to see what do you mean more precisely?

Thanks jorge. Do you have an example turtlebot description file for this as I've tried the above with no luck. Does the turtlebot_arm arm.launch file automatically call the combined turtlebot+arm model in rviz if you follow the above instructions? Cheers!

Answer updated with an example.  Nop,  arm.launch just starts an arm floating in the void

Hi Jorge - have come back to this and made some progress, but my arm appears rotated 90 degrees and the gripper appears wrong because I'm not able to find the _gripper parameters you describe. I'm using the standard turtlebot_arm repo not the corot repo. In which file are these parameters? Thanks!

Thanks Jorge, getting there! This works but I've got 2 problems (1) in rviz there's a "no transform from gripper_link to base_footprint" error and this is causing (2) turtlebot_arm_kinect_calibration to output "gripper_link passed to lookupTransform argument source_frame does not exist". Any ideas?
