Q:

RVIZ cannot be initialized

At the very beginning, the PC cannot be started, after remove the memory and plug back to the slot, the PC could be started. When I run some code, the rviz cannot be started, then I check the RVIZ alone, but it failed again. Corresponding terminal shows as the following:
rct@rct-desktop:~$ rosrun rviz rviz

Sorry that there is no room to reply to wiki, but to update the software does not work. I think Lorenz could be right, I will clear the memory manually. THX

A:

I don't think this is really a problem with ROS or rviz. Rather, I think you might have a broken memory module that reduces the amount of RAM that is available. It seems like rviz is just unable to allocate enough memory.
