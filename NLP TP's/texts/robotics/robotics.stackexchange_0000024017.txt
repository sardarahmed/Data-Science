Q:

How to read the map output file generated by a project using Cartographer without ROS

Currently I can successfully generate the map output file but I have no idea how to display it in practice. Basically, it should be a 2D SLAM map.
The project I'm using is available at the following link on Github. This project basically uses Google Cartographer 2D SLAM without ROS.
Compiling the project I get an output file called "map_output" but it seems to be completely raw: it's not even binary. How can I convert or read it in a viewable format?
Inside the main file, specifically inside the main function, it can be seen how data consisting of inertial measurements (IMU) is taken as input and processed to provide an output map.
Update: map_output file as requested is available here. (IMU data file is available here.) I'm pretty sure both can be read and/or represented in the same way.

From hexdump I see a lot the two rows of 16 bytes each that don't match the next rows which are mostly 0xff:
hexdump -C map_output  | more
00000000  46 00 00 00 dc 00 00 00  00 00 00 d4 cc cc fc bf  |F...............|

The file size is 15432 bytes, so 15400 bytes without that header, width * height = 154300 - so find factors using https://stackoverflow.com/a/70924583/603653
It looks like you can open it in the gimp by checking Show All Files then select Raw Image Data :
You then have to input the width and height manually, image type indexed, and set the offset to 32:

If that looks completely wrong then maybe some other import settings will work, but to me it looks a little like a 2D laser scan from a fixed location.
