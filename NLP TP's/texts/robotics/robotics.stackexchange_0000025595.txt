Q:

Error when using SetAngle

This is the error I get:
T* boost::shared_ptr::operator->() const [with T = gazebo::physics::Joint]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.
Can anybody tell me what it means?

A:

I found out... Never mind.
I was using the same pointer name for two different joints without realizing.
