Q:

ROSRUN IMAGE_VIEW problem

Hi everybody
I am trying to remotely see the image from a usb camera installed on a robot.
I run the command

rosrun image_view image_view image:=/logitech_usb_cam/image_raw

and I get this feedback
(image_raw:3417): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
What does this mean?
Thank you all
