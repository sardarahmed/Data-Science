Q:

Hi I need someone to help me. I am following the tutorial that is in the main ROS, but in the chapter: Recording and playing back data, when I run the recorded data I get this error:
turtlebot turtlebot-F200CA @: ~ / $ rosbag bagfiles -a record

Someone who can tell me or help to resolve this. Thank you

A:

Seems to me like it can't find some stuff from ros console?
Are you missing some ros dependencies?
