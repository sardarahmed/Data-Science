Q:

calc new pose according to twist

Is there any library to do this?
input geometry_msgs::Pose and geometry_msgs::Twist,
output new geometry_msgs::Pose.
I found tf::addDelta(), but it's a little bit different:
/// Starting from a Pose from A to B, apply a Twist with reference frame A and reference point B, during a time t.
geometry_msgs::Pose addDelta(const geometry_msgs::Pose &pose, const geometry_msgs::Twist &twist, const double &t)  attribute((deprecated));
and it's deprecated.
so is there any other library to calc new pose according to twist?

A:

Assuming that your Pose and Twist are already in the same reference frame, simply add the linear portion of the Twist to your pose's position.
Then, convert your Pose's orientation to a tf::Quaternion. Store the angular portion of the Twist as a second quaternion using setRPY() and multiply the two Quaternions together.
