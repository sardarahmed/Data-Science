Q:

Inverse Kinematics in Java

I'm planning to write an Inverse Kinematics controlled 6 dof virtual robot for Android. I did some research on packages avaliable and couldn't choose the right one which will satisfy my needs on this project. I've seen a work with Eigen in C++, and used it, it was just fine. But since i'm not so experienced in Java, i wanted to ask before i start, if someone knows some appropiate packages for these operations.
Here is what i found so far:
JAMA,
Vecmath,
Jmathtools,
EJML,
JAMPACK
I ask this because i really dont want to get stuck in the middle of my project. Thanks in advance.

A:

These are matrix-vector math libraries. They are related to inverse kinematics only because inverse kinematics involves matrices, vectors, and math. If you need an implementation of an inverse kinematics library, that is a different question. But any of those would be fine for doing the required math, once you solve the inverse kinematics in closed form or by some other method. Personally, I've used JAMA (it works).
