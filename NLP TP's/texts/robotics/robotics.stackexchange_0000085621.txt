Q:

CMake Error in rosmsg tutorial

I am in the tutorial at CreateMsgAndSrv and got stuck at chapter 3.
Running the command
$ rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num

got me the following
Unable to load msg [beginner_tutorials/Num]: Cannot locate message [unint8] in package [beginner_tutorials] with paths [['/home/aha/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg', '/home/aha/catkin_ws/devel/share/beginner_tutorials/msg']]

and searching the web for a solution I stumbled upon a thread where someone had somewhat the same problem and said that he made a
catkin_make install

after the changes at the package.xml and CMakeLists.txt which I did not.
But it made sense so I ran the command and then got the following error during the install process
CMake Error at /home/aha/catkin_ws/build/beginner_tutorials/cmake/beginner_tutorials-genmsg.cmake:3    (message):                                                                                             Could not find messages which                                                                          '/home/aha/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg/Num.msg' depends on.                                    Did you forget to specify generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES ...)?                                                         Cannot locate message [unint8] in  package [beginner_tutorials] with paths [['/home/aha/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg']]                                                                                    Call Stack (most recent call first): /opt/ros/kinetic/share/genmsg/cmake/genmsg-extras.cmake:307 (include) beginner_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt:71 (generate_messages)

But I followed the tutorial as it is written and did not forget to specify/uncomment "generate_messages".
As I am a Newbie, I am kind of lost now and do not really know how to proceed.
Can someone help me out?
System is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the ROS-Version is Kinetic and I added
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

and
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

to my ~/.bashrc.
Hope this sufficient information for the beginning...

Welcome!

I stumbled upon a thread

Can you please update your question with a link to the thread that you're referring to? Also, please update your question with a copy and paste of your CMakeLists.txt and package.xml files and msg definition
using the preformatted text (101010) button
Comment by AlexChris003 on 2018-03-01:
Oh, sure!
Sorry that I didn't think of it before.
Is there an easy way to add parapgraphs without getting the text out of the preformatted text field?
Comment by jayess on 2018-03-01:
Sorry, I don't understand your question.
Comment by jayess on 2018-03-01:
Just paste your text into the editor, then highlight anything that should be formatted and click the 101010 button.

seems not to work...followed you instructions but nothing happens :/
EDIT: no it worked, my browser did't show it properly to my, sorry again!
Comment by jayess on 2018-03-01:
Are you sure that you're following my instructions? I just did exactly what they say and it worked.
Comment by AlexChris003 on 2018-03-01:
After changing the xml- and txt-file, what did you do then?
Comment by jayess on 2018-03-01:
I only removed the comments from your CMakeLists.txt to make it fit better and easier to read.

A:

It looks like there's a typo in your message definition. You have unint8 instead of uint8 for the age property
int64 sum
string first_name
string last_name
unint8 age          # right here
uint32 score

It should be
int64 sum
string first_name
string last_name
uint8 age
uint32 score
