Q:

velodyne position packets

Hi, I don't know how accurate these are, but I tried to use position packets that described as below.

Position Packets contain(source port : 8308): Header,
Zero’s, 3x Boards with 8byte Gyro
data, Zero’s, Timestamp, Zero’s, NMEA
sentence, Zeros (total of 554 bytes,
incl 512 data bytes)

I can monitor the packets using Wireshark, but I wonder if the packets can be acquired by velodyne ros package. I saw only 2368 port number(distance and intensity info) on source codes. I'm not quite sure that the velodyne package is implemented to get the position packets.
Is there anyone who knows about this? :)

A:

Some Velodyne devices provide GPS packets in addition to 3D LIDAR data.
The current ROS Velodyne package does not support those packets. I maintain that driver, but our HDL-64E has no GPS attached. With no way to test it, I am in no position to maintain that feature.
Others have expressed an interest in supporting it. I've looked at the specification. I believe it can and should be implemented as a separate driver handling only the port 8308 packets.
If you want to implement that, I would recommend starting with the nmea_gps_driver maintained by Eric Perko, and adapting it to handle the Velodyne-specific UDP packets.
EDIT: there is now an experimental gps_imu branch in the source repository. It's not yet ready to release, but user testing would be helpful. If you do try it, please post your results (both positive and negative) to issue #24.

Thanks for your helpful advice.

There is presently an API review for a new version of the nmea_gps_driver. The proposed changes should be very helpful for anyone implementing a GPS driver for the 32E. Please participate, if interested.
