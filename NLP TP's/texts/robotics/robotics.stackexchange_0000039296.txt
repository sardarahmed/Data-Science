Q:

Import tf in python, in fuerte

Hello there,
Probably a dumb question, but I'm not sure how to import tf in Python with fuerte.
I've installed fuerte with the Ubuntu packages.
tf is available in the geometry stack, but it does not seem to install anything in /opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.6/dist-packages, so a simple "import tf" does not work (which is what is mention in the doc).
Should I use the old 'manifest + roslib' way?

What is the old way, btw?

A:

Only the lower-level libraries have been converted to use the FHS/standard locations.  If it doesn't start with a 'ros' prefix, it probably hasn't been converted.  Only ros, ros_comm, rx, actionlib, and common_msgs were converted.
You still use the old way for tf.  It will likely transition in Groovy.
