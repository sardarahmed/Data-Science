Q:

When launching gazebo no GUI overlay apears, and 'undefined symbol' error is printed in terminal

Hi.  I followed GUI overlay tutorial "Display Simulation Time". When launching Gazebo no GUI overlay appears, and following error is printed in the terminal:
[Err] [Plugin.hh:180] Failed to load plugin /.../ libgui_example_time_widget.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5QTest18lastMouseTimestampE
[Err] [RenderWidget.cc:311] Unable to create gui overlay plugin with filename[libgui_example_time_widget.so]
The other tutorial "Spawn spheres" results in similar error
I am using
Gazebo 9.0.0
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
Qt version 5.9.5

This is a known issue on Gazebo 9 + 18.04: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/2541/gui-plugins-failed-to-load

This issue is apparently not publicly visible :/

A:

I installed Ubuntu  16.04 LTS, and now this problem is gone, GUI overlays works as expected.
Now there is this weird behavior in model editor, when resizing shapes (In previous setup with ubuntu 18.04 it worked just fine ), but since i don't need to use model editor, it's not a problem.
