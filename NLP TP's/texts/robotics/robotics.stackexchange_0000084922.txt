Q:

Is it possible to change color scheme for rviz map display?

Hello,
I am trying to create a customized color scheme for map display with rviz. I see that 3 schemes are supported: map, costmap, and raw. However, is there a way for adding more color schemes without changing the source code and rebuilding? perhaps through the configuration file?
Thanks.
