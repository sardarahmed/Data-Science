Q:

Make nodes executable

Hi.
Must I only make nodes executable which I create by myself (for example like this: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29), or also the nodes which I have downloaded in a package from ROS? Or should the last one are automatically executable?

A:

To provide another type of answer for the question..
If you're using a compiled language, then the compiler (and the build system) should take care of the all of the details. If using an interpreted language, the a little more work is required.
If the first line of the node is set to the needed Shebang e.g. #!/usr/bin/env python,
and
the file is converted to an executable by changing the file properties e.g. chmod 755 filename (See here and other places on the web for details about chmod),
then the node will be executable.
