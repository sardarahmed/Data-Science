Q:

Kinect with rviz

I am a beginner of both ROS, Kinect and Ubuntu. What i want is to visualize kinect data on rviz environment then run object recognition on it.
I've tried a few tutorials but had no luck. All I got was an empty rviz world.
Since I am a beginner I would appreciate any step-by-step intructions (preferably for hydro or groovy).
I would also like to note that I've menaged to get visual from kinect so the device is working fine.

A:

To install the package fro kinect run:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-launch

The to use: roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch as described here to make the package publish kinect's topics.
To visualize for example the depth image run rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image.
To visualize for example the Point Cloud in rviz you can add a PointCloud2 Display ad choose the appropriate topic. For object recognition what are you planning to use?
I suggest you to see also the basic tutorials and the rviz tutorials!

Hello and thank you for your reply. I've managed to get the visual from kinect however still can't see it on rviz.  For example, after running the depth image i set fixed frame on rviz to depth frame but nothing changes. What else do I need to do ?
