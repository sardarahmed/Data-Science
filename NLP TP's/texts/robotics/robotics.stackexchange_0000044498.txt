Q:

Creating robot models in stage under ROS‚Äè

Hello,
I have found a tutorial, which describes how to create robot models for player/stage. Can I apply this 1:1 to stageros? In particular does the stage wrapper in ros support all sensors? Or are there any limitations?
BR

Which tutorial did you find? It's difficult to answer your question about the 1:1 applicability if you don't add a little more detail.

A:

The current stageros only supports one laser sensor per robot. People have long wished for a more flexible implementation, but no one has done that project yet.
It is possible to construct your own alternative to stageros with support for other sensors to fit your specific needs.

Does this mean, that stageros can't be extended to support more than one ultrasonic sensors?
What do you mean by alternative to stageros? Does this comprise a complete alternative from scratch?
