Q:

Run laserscanner in Android

Hello, I want to driver my Laserscanner under Android system (a smartphone or a tab). I am using Hokoyo Laserscanner UTM-30LX.  Does anyone have experience?
How to supply the Laserscanner from smartphone or tab? Do I need an adapter to give the scanner appropriate Voltage?
Normally the USB in smartphone or tab has a mini USB. How can I use a Y cable to connect the Laserscanner and the smartphone or tab?
For your answer my heartfelt appreciation!

A:

I don't think this is going to work. You'll need 12V. Technically you can build a voltage converter that gives you 12V from USB voltage, but I think a smartphone USB will be way too less power for a UTM-30LX. It's definitely too much for USB specs. Do NOT use a Y cable!!!
In addition, you'll need a USB host port. My guess is most smartphones don't have that.
