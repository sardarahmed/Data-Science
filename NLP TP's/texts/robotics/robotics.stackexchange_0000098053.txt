Q:

/rosout node is the one who publishes topics when I send rostopic pub?

Hey guys, I am new to ROS and starting to understand what happens in ROS so when I publish something like
$ rostopic pub -1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 1.8]'

Is it /rosout node responsible for publishing this topic or does Terminal have its own properties that can publish and subscribe to topics?

No to both actually. rostopic is its own publisher.
rosout (well, really rosout_agg) is basically stdout, but then for a complete ROS application (ie: all ROS nodes running).
