Q:

Rostest succeeds test if a node crashes

If a node in a test-case crashed, rostest doesn't care about it, and succeeds the testcase.
For example:
$ rostest somepkg basic.test
... logging to /home/parallels/.ros/log/rostest-parallels-vm-6224.log
[ROSUNIT] Outputting test results to /home/parallels/.ros/test_results/somepkg/rostest-test_basic.xml
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/parallels/catkin_ws/src/somepkg/src/fail.py", line 3, in <module>
    print 1/0
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
[Testcase: testbasic_test] ... ok

[ROSTEST]-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[clever.rosunit-basic_test/test_state][passed]

SUMMARY
 * RESULT: SUCCESS
 * TESTS: 1
 * ERRORS: 0
 * FAILURES: 0

rostest log file is in /home/parallels/.ros/log/rostest-parallels-vm-6224.log

How to make rostest fail the test if a node crashes?

A:

Actually, to make the nodes "required" is kind of a solution.
