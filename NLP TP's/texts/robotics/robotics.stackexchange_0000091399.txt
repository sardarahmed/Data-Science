Q:

Code completion Clion

Hello,
I'm working with Clion to write C++ code for ROS. I just started with a simple publisher which publishes a message of the type
geometry_msgs::Pose msg;

When I want to do code completion, Clion tells me 'No suggestions for members of geometry_msgs::Pose. It also tells me, that
#include "geometry_msgs/Pose.h"

is not found. The code compiles and works fine though. How can I get the code completion for a easier code writing working?

Did you try sourcing devel/setup.bash before launching CLion? ie. Run source devel/setup.bash and then from the same terminal run clion.sh

Yes, I've tried that but it didn't work.

Did you go to the CMake tab in the bottom and press reload?

If your problem is solved now, please accept my answer.

A:

Make sure to reload the top-level CMake by right-clicking the file and press 'reload'. Or go to the CMake tab at the bottom and press 'reload'.
