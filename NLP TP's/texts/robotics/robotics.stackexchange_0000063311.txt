Q:

rosrun will not execute despite successful build

After a successful catkin_make, I made sure to source devel/setup.bash inside the catkin workspace and ran roscore.
The output of echo "$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH" is "/home/alex/kinect_bench/src:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks".
I get his warning from catkin_make:

also, when I run roswtf the output is:

What is the exact command that is failing? is it rosrun grabber grabber ?
Comment by kinect_guy on 2014-10-14:
the failing command is rosrun grabber openni_grabber openni_grabber is the file located at ~/kinect_bench/src/grabber/src/openni_grabber.cpp

A:

The add_executable(grabber src/openni_grabber.cpp) line in your CMakeLists is creating an executable named grabber. Therefore, the correct command to run your program is:
rosrun grabber grabber
