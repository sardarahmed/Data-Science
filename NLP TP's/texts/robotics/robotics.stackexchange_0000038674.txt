Q:

How to Re-Tag questions since latest update?

How can one re-tag other questions? Either I can't find the button or the functionality was changed since the last update of ROS answers. It used to be possible with enough Karma.

Could you please test this now? Thank you.

Yes, seems to be working now. Thanks!

A:

The retag link is in the same row of icons as "edit", "close", etc. that are below the poster's name and information block. It is between the "edit" and "flag offensive" icons - at least that's where it is for me when viewing this question.
Can you retag your own question? If it's just not showing up on other people's questions and it used to, perhaps the required karma amount changed in the update.

Yes, I see them for my own question and it works, but not for others. http://answers.ros.org/faq/ still mentions 100 Karma for re-tags and I should even be able to edit. The thing is that there is not any button under someone else's question for me, not even "flag offensive".
