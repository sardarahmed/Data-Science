Q:

Camera / Perception Tutorials in ROS

Hello,
I'm working with 2 robots, each one with one camera. I'm first simulating the robots. Are there any tutorials about Vision in ROS?
Where you can learn the basics? I had courses in Image processing and Vision but I never worked with image/cameras with ROS.
I'm doing the Visualisation tutorial but I think this is not what I want....Any recommendations?
Thx you so much!

A:

Although not free, I would strongly recommend @Pi Robot's book ROS by Example for vision-perception educational contents using ROS. This book is collective, exhaustive, and insightful.
