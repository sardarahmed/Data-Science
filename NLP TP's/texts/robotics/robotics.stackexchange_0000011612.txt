Q:

SLAM: Why use two cameras (stereo) if SLAM can be done using single camera (monocular)?

I am aware that algorithm for monocular SLAM is complex compared to stereo SLAM. But my question is if by any means it is possible to do SLAM using one camera why one should use two cameras to do the same thing?

A:

The most important point is the scale. If you do monocular SLAM, your map will only be accurate up to scale so that you e.g. cannot compute the length of the travelled path in meters. The scale between your map and the world is not even constant over time so that if you come back to your starting point, it's going to be difficult to match the beginning and end of you map as they have a different scale.
