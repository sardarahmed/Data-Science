Q:

Navigation stack, local_planner and odometry: covariance all zeros ok?

Hello,
We're just getting started tuning the navigation stack for this robot. We're publishing odometry as described here, and so far, so good. I'm confused about something though: in the code, we're broadcasting nav_msgs/Odometry messages without setting the covariances (i.e. they're all zeros).
My question: is this the correct thing to do?
Thanks in advance,
Rick

A:

It depends on what you're doing with those messages. If you have another node that just needs the odometry information (like rviz), then the covariances are superfluous. If you want to fuse that data with other sources, then most algorithms will require the covariances to be non-zero. You may also be interested in having that information for debugging purposes.
