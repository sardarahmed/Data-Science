Q:

Can't move a package

Hey guys,
I have a conflict between the g2o that I downloaded and the one that is pre-installed with ros-fuerte. I am trying to move the package libg2o to another folder. However when I right click, the move to and move to rubbish bin cannot be accessed.
Any Ideas on resolving this issue? thanks a lot.
Regards,
Khalid

A:

Create an overlay as explained here. Then, check out g2o in there and build it.
