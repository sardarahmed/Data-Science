Q:

ROS installation on Mac with Homebrew--bootstrapping issues?

Hi!
I'm trying to install ROS on my MacBook Pro (running Mac OS X 10.7.3).  I have followed everything in the installation instructions here (http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/OSX/Homebrew), but at the very end of the Desktop-Full Install, I get this:
(Over-)Writing setup.sh, setup.bash, and setup.zsh in /Users/lauraS/ros
Bootstrapping ROS build
Detected ros_comm bootstrapping it too.
sed: illegal option -- s

    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'source /Users/lauraS/ros/setup.sh && rosmake ros ros_comm --rosdep-install' returned non-zero exit status 127

And if I try to run the next step, source ~/ros/setup.bash, I get:
    sed: illegal option -- s
usage: sed script [-Ealn] [-i extension] [file ...]
       sed [-Ealn] [-i extension] [-e script] ... [-f script_file] ... [file ...]

       sed [-Ealn] [-i extension] [-e script] ... [-f script_file] ... [file ...]
rospack could not be found, you cannot have rosbash features until you bootstrap ros

I'm kind of new at this and am not actually sure what bootstrapping is, and I've no idea how to go about getting things installed properly from this point.  Any help would be appreciated!
Thanks!
Update: After taking tmf's suggestions, I think the installer has gotten further than it got before, but now after rosinstall installs robot_model_tutorials, I get this:
(Over-)Writing setup.sh, setup.bash, and setup.zsh in /Users/lauraS/ros
Bootstrapping ROS build
Detected ros_comm bootstrapping it too.

and then it hangs until I ctrl-c it.  For the record, I have tried running the rosinstall command both on a ~/ros folder that has all of the files from the previous install attempts in it and on a ~/ros folder that I emptied myself.  I'd appreciate any ideas of how to get the installation to finish!  Thanks!
Update 2:  In case it helps, here is what shows up on my Terminal after I push ctrl-c when the install hangs at Detected ros_comm bootstrapping it too.:

Does that information happen to help anyone shed some light on what might be keeping the installation from continuing?  From what I've seen on other questions people have asked, my installation is on the right track but just can't continue past detecting the other bootstrapper for some reason.  I'd appreciate any ideas!  Thanks!

UPDATE: Sorry for the lack of responses--I switched to my Ubuntu VM for this project.  But when the project is over, I'll try installing ROS on my Mac again.  Thanks for the help (and the bug fix)!

A:

This was a bug in rosinstall.  It's fixed in 0.6.12.  Ticket
