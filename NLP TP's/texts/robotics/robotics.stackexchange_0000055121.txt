Q:

tf transformPoint() equivalent on tf2?

It used to be that, with tf, we would use a TransformListener and its transformDATA() methods, e.g.
import tf
listener = tf.TransformListener()
...
ptNew = listener.transformPoint('frameNew', ptOld)

but now with tf2 (i.e. tf2_ros), there doesn't seem to be a transformPoint().  The only place I can find something close is in tf2_geometry_msgs.do_transform_point(), which requires PyKDL (not installed by default with ROS).  I can't find any docs on the api for the do_transform_DATA(), however, and I see that the code is called "geometry_experimental" on github.  Am I just trying to use this before it's ready for prime time, or is there something I'm missing as far as docs and using the tf2 listener?
Edit: Bump. I'm also facing this problem.

Is there an update on this? Transforming points from one coordinate system to the other is, for me, the essential use-case of tf2. But it seems that this is supported only poorly and documented even more poorly.

A:

You can use the transform or transform_full methods from the BufferInterface on any datatype which implements do_transform
tf2 is now recommended. It is still in the geometry_experimental repository but only for legacy reasons.

hey @tfoote, I tried using the transform method to transform a stamped pose, and got this error:
File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tf2_ros/buffer_interface.py", line 43, in transform do_transform = self.registration.get(type(object_stamped))

For anyone that comes across this, to transform PoseStamped messages you can try installing ros-kinetic-tf2-geometry-msgs and then importing tf2_geometry_msgs

Is there an update on this? I am following this tutorial and can't figure out the tf2 equivalent of the listener.transformPoint() part, I tried including buffer_interface.h but the methods mentioned above were still not available
