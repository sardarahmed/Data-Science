Q:

Ubuntu ARM install of ROS Indigo

Hi,
I'm trying to install ros indigo on Odroid U3. Following the instructions in wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM. In point 2.5 when I'm trying to update I get the following error:
E: Type 'dep' is not known on line 1 in sources list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
E: The list of sources could not be read
I have no idea wants going wrong. Someone who can help me?

A:

It looks like you're misspelled deb as dep.
You should correct your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list so that it contains:
deb http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros trusty main
