Q:

Cannot run roscore with latest Ubuntu 12.04 Packages

I just ran an update on my system (sudo apt-get upgrade, sudo apt-get upgrade) which included a whole bunch of updated ROS packages. Upon rebooting my system I am now unable to run anything ROS related. Even running roscore presents the same error:
rctoris@MAGLEV:~$ roscore
... logging to /home/rctoris/.ros/log/713123b6-c157-11e1-bd8b-782bcbad8931/roslaunch-MAGLEV-3057.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/rosversion", line 76, in <module>
    version = rosstack.get_stack_version(stack_name)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/rospack.py", line 359, in get_stack_version
    return get_stack_version_by_dir(self.get_path(stack))

  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/manifest.py", line 343, in parse_manifest_file
    return parse_manifest(manifest_name, f.read(), filename)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/manifest.py", line 404, in parse_manifest
    m.author = _check('author')(p, filename)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospkg/manifest.py", line 67, in check
    raise InvalidManifest("Invalid manifest file [%s]: must have a single '%s' element"%(filename, name))
rospkg.manifest.InvalidManifest: Invalid manifest file [/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/stack.xml]: must have a single 'author' element
Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion ros] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is <param command="rosversion ros" name="rosversion"/>

According to this bug report, it appears as if there was an update to allow for multiple author tags. Is it possible part of this update did not make it into the debian packages? I am running the Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit Fuerte packages.
