Q:

Multiple Instances of GZServer and GZWeb

I am newbie to gazebo and gzweb. What I am doing is to connect multiple users to different sessions of gzweb on my computer. Once a user logged in with their account, system will login to their account on terminal and create a gazebo platform with gzweb. I can run multiple gzweb instances on different ports with different hostnames but, all of them connects to one instance of gzserver. I tried exporting GAZEBO_MASTER_URI variable to different hostnames and ports according to gzweb's host and port. gzserver starts multiple times while users are different but never connects to gzweb or vice versa.
Any help would be appreciated.

A:

gzweb's websocket server's address is currently hardcoded to 7681 so you'll probably need to manually change it to a differnt port for each gzweb you run. Here's the port number on server side, and you'll need to update the client side too.
