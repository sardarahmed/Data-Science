Q:

sensor_msgs/Imu Frame of reference?

What is the frame of reference for sensor_msgs/Imu?
It seems vague.
If the gyro rotate in counter clockwise direction around +Z direction is angular_velocity.z positive or negative?
If the robot is stationary then would  linear_acceleration.z be +9.8 m/s^2 or -9.8 m/s^2 ?
If the robot moves from zero velocity to 1m/s in the X direction would linear_acceleration.x be positive or negative?
