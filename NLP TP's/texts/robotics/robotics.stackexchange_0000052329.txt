Q:

catkin_make package not found

Hi guys,
I'm trying to follow this tutorial  http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF  but after I catkin_make the package with this output:
Base path: /home/master/catkin_ws
Source space:
/home/master/catkin_ws/src Build
space: /home/master/catkin_ws/build
Devel space:
/home/master/catkin_ws/devel Install
space: /home/master/catkin_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in
"/home/master/catkin_ws/build"

#### Running command: "make -j1 -l1" in "/home/master/catkin_ws/build"
####

but when I try

rosrun robot_setup_tf tf_broadcaster

the sheel output is:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable
named tf_broadcaster below
/catkin_ws/build/robot_setup_tf/catkin_generated/stamps/robot_setup_tf

I'm a newbie in source devoloping soo I don't know what I'm doing wrong, thanks in advance for any help.

A:

It looks to me as if your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable is set wrong.  ROS should be looking in /home/master/catkin_ws/devel, not the build directory for your executables.
Did you remember to source the devel/setup.bash file to add the catkin workspace to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?  More info at the bottom of this tutorial.
$ source devel/setup.bash

thanks a lot, it works, but now the other packages are not found. I create the catkin_ws inside the $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and I don't remember how to set  both path as ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.Could you help me one more time?
