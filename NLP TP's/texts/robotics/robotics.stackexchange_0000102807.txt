Q:

Where are the controller_manager logs

Hello,
I'am trying to use ros2 controllers on gazebo, yet without sucess.
When launching the  joint_trajectory_controller :
ros2 control load_controller --set-state active joint_trajectory_controller

I have an error :
[ros2-2] Error loading controller, check controller_manager logs
[ERROR] [ros2-2]: process has died [pid 30159, exit code 1, cmd 'ros2 control load_controller --set-state active joint_trajectory_controller'].

Do you know where I can find the  "controller_manager" logs on ros2 humble?

A:

You can find the logs in the terminal, in which you launched the controller manager.
So in case of the ign_ros2_control repository (https://github.com/ros-controls/gz_ros2_control), if you launch the demo "cart_example_position.launch.py" for example, the controller manager logs will be in the terminal, where you launched this demo.

Same problem here - looked in recommended location but did not find a log, is there a filename pattern or extension I can search for (e.g. .log)?
Also is there some way to get the verbose output to the terminal instead of just to log?

Yeah, it is pretty subtle as the logs are sometimes just one line, but the terminal with which I launched the controller_manager has a a "log" info, usually starting with :
[ERROR] [1685575141.283231272] [controller_manager]:
