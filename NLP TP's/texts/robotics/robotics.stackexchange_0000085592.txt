Q:

Common-used packages for robot control

Few days ago I found out ROS Control pacakge. Are there any other widly-used typical packages\stacks for common robot control tasks, such as robot joints control, inverse kinematics (MoveIt! maybe), visualization robot in RViz etc? Maybe there is some full index of ros packages\stacks?

A:

There are a lot of packages. You can browse them here: http://www.ros.org/browse/list.php?package_type=package&distro=indigo
A common metric for how commonly used a package is to look at how many dependencies it has on it from their wiki page side bar "Used By" count. (It's better for libraries than applications though.)

I can't find this "used by" block. Where it is?

On the right side bar of package wiki pages. eg http://wiki.ros.org/controller_manager_msgs
