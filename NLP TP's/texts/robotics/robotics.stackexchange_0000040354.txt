Q:

rosmake perception_pcl after change of pcl source

Hi,
I use the source based installed version of pcl-trunk (perception_pcl_electric_unstable). I changed some visualization functions and want to compile them. Is there a way to compile only the changed part of pcl or do I need compile everything with

rosmake pcl --pre-clean?

It would save me a lot of time!
Thanks a lot
Stefan

A:

Thanks for your answer!
Thats the error I get: I thinks that has something to do with the reimplementation of sensor_msgs in pcl. That files will be deleted in the Makefile of perception_pcl/pcl/

Linking CXX shared library ../lib/libpcl_visualization.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsensor_msgs
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [lib/libpcl_visualization.so.1.6.0] Error 1
make[1]: *** [visualization/CMakeFiles/pcl_visualization.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

Thanks
Stefan

Ah ok.  So if you look in the Makefile found in the root of the pcl package directory, there are a couple of lines that export library path variables.  Copy and paste these into your shell before doing the above.
