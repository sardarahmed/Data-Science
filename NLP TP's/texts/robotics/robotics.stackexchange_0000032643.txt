Q:

Using a different gyro on a turtlebot

Hi folks,
We are building our own TurtleBot and I am having problems with the IMU.
I am using the SparkFun ADXL203/ADXRS613 IMU (SEN-09127, http://bit.ly/jw6iUL).
What I am experiencing when I try to calibrate it is similar to the problem described at:

...but I haven't remapped anything.
The IMU is wired to +5V, ground and AIN on the Create through the pinouts on an Element Direct BAM (http://bit.ly/iHaTB8). The BAM isn't the problem; AIN passes through to pin 4, just like it should. When I first saw the problem I wired the IMU up to +5V on a bench supply and slapped a multimeter between RATE and ground. When I move the IMU around, I can see the voltage change, so the IMU is working.
If I look at /imu/raw and move the Create around manually, the X/Y/Z values remain at 0 (I don't have the accelerometer pins connected to anything, FYI), so I know that the problem is somewhere between the IMU and the ROS gyro stuff.
I know that my next troubleshooting activity is to see if the Create is actually receiving what the IMU is giving it, but I don't really know the best way to do that, and in any case my gut tells me that this is a software or configuration (not hardware) problem.
Does anybody have any suggestions?
