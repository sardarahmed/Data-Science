Q:

When changing set_max_velocity_scaling_factor(0.5), moveit couldn't plan trajectory

Hello,
I am right now working to slow down the velocity of the abb_irb6640 model. When I use set_max_velocity_scaling_factor(1), everything works fine. But when I want to use set_max_velocity_scaling_factor(0.5), I get an error :
Invalid Trajectory: start point deviates from current robot state more than 0.01 joint 'joint_1': expected: 0.575495, current: 0.6802.
My system is: melodic and ubuntu 18.04
Any leads will be very helpful.

A:

Found an answer:
Because I used group.execute(wait=False), moveIt does not wait for the trajectory to complete the first path, as it does not track the status of trajectory execution. And as soon as moveit received second execute command, it sends this above error. set_max_velocity_factor() was not an issue. So, used this wait parameter cautiously.
