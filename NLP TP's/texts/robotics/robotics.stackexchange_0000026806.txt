Q:

kineckt is not available in my rostopic list!

Hi all,
I installed Ros hydro along with Gazebo package(1.9) for Ros in ubuntu 12.04, i run gazebo with this command
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

and i add sensors like Hokyuo and kineckt, i can't see the topic of them in rostopic list, i know that i should add plugin for them but at first i don't know the format and specified plugin for them and after that i am not sure about the place that i should add plugin, my mean is, should i add plugin tag in SDF file of this sensors or other place?
please if it is possible write the complete plugin tag for these sensors especially kineckt, I tried many times but those don't work!!!!

A:

Hi, before you can see/access any topics for sensors in gazebo, you need to load the corresponding plugin.
I actually do not have an SDF-version, but my URDF file for the kinect looks like this. (I assume that you already have a link and a joint for the sensor, e.g. kinect)
<!-- SENSOR -->

thank you so much my friend, it works ;) i have another question, as i know kinect returns us depth, ir data and image, now i have these topic, but there is just ir and depth topic, how can i get image of kinect? maybe i am wrong!
Comment by psei on 2013-10-15:
With the configuration above you should see a "/camera/rgb/image_raw" topic. This is the RGB image. As far as I can see, the simulated kinect does not have an IR-Image topic (only depth).
