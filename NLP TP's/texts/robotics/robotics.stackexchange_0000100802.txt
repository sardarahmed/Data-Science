Q:

How to link between make program with ROS

Hello. I wanted to ask I have the make program sensor from A111 pulsed radar sensor from sparkfun. https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-the-a111-pulsed-radar-sensor/all#get-the-sdk
From the program how can I link with ROS. I'm using ROS noetic, raspberry pi debian buster 32 bit. Is there anyone can teach and help me with this since I don't have experienced in ROS. Thank you

A:

You have to work through a few first tutorials there (up to ROS "Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++)" will be enough) and then use example program from Sparkfun with reading sensors from A111 - you should try to modify and implement publishing appropriate type of ROS msg or a custom one for your needs.
