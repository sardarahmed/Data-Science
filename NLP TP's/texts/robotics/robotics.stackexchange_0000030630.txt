Q:

bullet euler angle methods

What exactly are the differences between:

getEulerZYX/setEulerZYX
getEulerYPR/setEulerYPR
getRPY/setRPY

EDIT: I'm looking at bullet (and the ROS patches).

Which library/set of code are you using?  Is this for bullet?

A:

These were discussed in this meeting
The methods are documented in the headers.  However, I see the doxygen docs are not generating correctly at the moment so I'll copy them here:
get/setRPY is recommended
  /**@brief Set the quaternion using fixed axis RPY
   * @param roll Angle around X 
   * @param pitch Angle around Y
   * @param yaw Angle around Z*/
  void setRPY(const btScalar& roll, const btScalar& pitch, const btScalar& yaw)

get/setEuler is defined as follows:
  /**@brief Set the quaternion using Euler angles
   * @param yaw Angle around Y
   * @param pitch Angle around X
   * @param roll Angle around Z */
    void setEuler(const btScalar& yaw, const btScalar& pitch, const btScalar& roll)

get/setEulerZYX is deprecated due to being ambiguous in different implementations:
  /**@brief Set the quaternion using euler angles 
   * @param yaw Angle around Z
   * @param pitch Angle around Y
   * @param roll Angle around X */
  void setEulerZYX(const btScalar& yaw, const btScalar& pitch, const btScalar& roll) __attribute__((deprecated))

Bullet natively uses a different convention for yaw pitch and roll.  The difference between fixed axis and euler angles are defined here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles#Euler_angles_as_composition_of_extrinsic_rotations

I'm not sure I understand the difference between fixed-axis rotation and Euler angles. Is different from R(θ) = Rx(θ) * Ry(θ) * Rz(θ)? Also, what's the convention for get/setEuler? YXZ? Is pitch really around the x axis? I thought it was the y axis...
