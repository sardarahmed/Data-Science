Q:

Need help regarding odometry using Encoder motor and raspberry pi

I am doing project on odometry using raspberry pi. I know that encoder motor will tell me how much distance my robot has covered, but I have no idea ho to implement completely. I just need guideline about which steps to follow. Till now I have interfaced motor with raspberry pi and counted the number of rotation. I have questions as follow?
How to plot map of odometry using which language and library?
If you know anything, just give me guideline about steps to follow.

A:

You could maybe use Matlab to plot the position of your vehicle? This is how I'm trying to do that:
I have a 'logging'-program running on the Raspberry Pi that counts each sampling time the pulses from the encoders. This I log in a file. This file I upload in Matlab to calculate X and Y coordinate and the angle under which the vehicle is standing, assuming the vehicle starts at coordinate (0,0) and angle 0Â°.
These are the formula's I use. With 'triangle'-r and 'triangle'-l I mean the distance traveled by left and right wheel (can be calculated using pulses in log file and diameter of the wheel). Distance '2L' is the distance between the 2 wheels.

I wrote a matlab GUI in which I can browse a data file (from the Pi), calculates the X and Y position every sampling period and plot this is an XY graph. 
Ps: you didn't mention it, but I suppose you have a differential drive vehicle?!
