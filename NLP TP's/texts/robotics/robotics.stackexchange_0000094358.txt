Q:

wheels of mobile 4 wheel robot tilt in gazebo when trying to rotate about its axis

The joints in the robot are continuous. but when the robot tries to change its yaw, the wheel joints deform as if due to friction the robot is not able to rotate. I tried to change the link mass and friction values but no effect. I don't understand why the joints ane not stiff. problem screenshot This image shows the problem.
If anyone faced this kind of problem earlier, please help.
Thanks

Yes, I was able to fix this issue. Sorry for not updating this thread. I have put my solution in the answers, please find it there.

A:

The solution to this problem can be found in the updated xacro for this robot at description file
<dynamics damping="0"/>

The property of the joint needs to be mentioned in the robot description to avoid such deformation of joint. I hope that helps.
