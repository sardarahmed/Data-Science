Q:

What is the top speed of a four legged robot?

In  Neal Stephenson's novel "Snow Crash", a robotic/cybernetic creature known as a "Rat Thing" looses its bounds and runs to rescue another character.  The Rat Thing is portrayed at moving over 700 mph and causing sonic shock waves.  Can such a speed be reached by purely mechanical means? 

A:

Currently the fastest four legged robot is Cheetah by Boston Dynamics that runs 29mph. Real cheetahs can run 70mph and are the fastest land animals. I don't think it would be possible for a robot to run much faster than that. Why? At higher speeds aerodynamics play a crucial role, and a legged design would be hard to optimize in that way. 
Also keep in mind, that there is currently only one land vehicle that broke a sound barrier - thrustSSC. Powered by jet engines, it consumes insane 18l of fuel per second. The mass of the fuel itself would be extremely hard to carry for a legged robot.
