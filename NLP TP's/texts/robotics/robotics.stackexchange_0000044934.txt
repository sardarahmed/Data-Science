Q:

rviz: unsaved changes

Is it possible to somehow prevent rviz from asking to save unsaved changes?

A:

There is no direct way to do this, but fell free to write a patch :) You are not the only one annoyed be this popup.
Good practise is not to close rviz at all, only after work with the robot. If you need to restart rviz for some reason, it means there is something wrong with your code or rviz itself (happens too). I use to close rviz from time to time when I am working on battery, it saves some power (opengl likes my cpu).
As a workaround:

ctrl+s and alt+f4 to speed things up, or
alt+tab and ctrl+c, when you don't want changes to be saved

I don't know of any better solution.
