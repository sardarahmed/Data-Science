Q:

rosdep update for Fedora

I am configuring a user account on a Fedora machine to use ROS which is installed in the administer account.
When I use
$rosdep update
reading in sources list data from /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d
... (couple of lines that I am not allowed to put here, they are online link)
Ignore legacy gbpdistro "groovy"
Ignore legacy gbpdistro "hydro"
Query rosdistro index ...
Add distro "groovy"
Add distro "hydro"
updated cache in /home/solmaz/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache
Then when I try
$ source /opt/ros/grooby/setup.bash
I get
CATKIN_SHELL=bash: Command not found.
Illegal variable name.
or when I try
$ export | grep ROS
I get
export: Command not found.
I need help in fixing this. Please explain your solution a bit in detail.

A:

It looks like you are not using bash? Maybe you're using sh or tcsh or zsh?
