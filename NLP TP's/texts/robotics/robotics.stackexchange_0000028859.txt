Q:

models within a box are jittery. How to prevent the vibration?

I am trying to make a box that contains multiple balls. However as soon as I add a second layer of balls, the balls in the first layer begin to vibrate. Is there any specific values that i need to add to prevent this from happening.
edit: It seems that the balls do not have enough space in the lower layer and begin vibrating instead of rearranging themselves.
Thanks in advance.

probably you should set a parameter called max_depth, ex:
<collision name="collision0">
      <surface>
        <contact>
          <ode>
            <min_depth>0.01</min_depth>
          </ode>
        </contact>
     </surface>
</collision>

You can check this link for a comparison between different values of max_depth

@dkoung Thanks for the response. I tried the following and it did not solve the problem. The issue I observed is that there is not enough space for all the balls in the lower layer and so they collide with each other instead of rearranging themselves.

Edit to my previous response: it's min_depth not max_depth, sorry.
Also try max_vel=0.0, it is maximum interpenetration error correction velocity. By setting it to 0, interpenetrating objects will not be pushed apart.
<collision name="collision0">
  <surface>
    <contact>
      <ode>
        <min_depth>0.01</min_depth>
        <max_vel>0.0</max_vel>
      </ode>
    </contact>
  </surface>
</collision>

@dkoung Worked like a charm. Thanks a lot!

@adheeshenoy You're welcome.

A:

So the answer is:
Making max_vel=0.0 and adding min_depth to a really small value like 0.01.
For example:
<collision name="collision0">
<surface>
    <contact>
      <ode>
        <min_depth>0.01</min_depth>
        <max_vel>0.0</max_vel>
      </ode>
    </contact>
  </surface>
</collision>

Thank you to dkoung for the answer.
