Q:

Incorrect values in atlas.urdf

Perhaps I don't understand the arguments for safety_controller correctly, but shouldn't the soft_lower_limit and soft_upper_limit values be within the joint limits specified in limit? Also, these values are in radians, so a value such as 10.6109 doesn't make much sense given knowledge of the robot's capabilities. Are these values a typo or am I misunderstanding their meaning?
<joint name="back_lbz" type="revolute">
  ...
  <limit effort="124.016" velocity="12" lower="-0.610865" upper="0.610865" />
  <safety_controller k_position="100" k_velocity="100" soft_lower_limit="-10.6109" soft_upper_limit="10.6109" />
</joint>

Thanks!

Would like to see this addressed, so I created https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim/issue/172/safety-limits-out-of-range

A:

The <safety_controller> is no longer in use since the pr2_controllers are no longer used. The corresponding drcsim ticket has been marked won't fix.
