Q:

rviz ignores origin if it has decimal values

Hello,
I'm trying to modeling my first robot using URDF. The problem that I have is that when I visualize it with rviz, I can see that the joint's origins are ignored if they contains decimal points (for instance, something like "origin xyz="0 0 -0.08""). If, however, I use a comma to write decimal values on the origins (such as "origin xyz="0 0 -0.08""), everything works well.
This wouldn't be a problem if xacro didn't complain when I try to use math operations with comma decimals. So it is not clear to me if this is a bug on xacro, on rviz or if I am doing something wrong.
Anyone would have a clue of what can be happening?
For your reference, I am using ROS Lunar.
Thank you very much in advance.
Regards

A:

This sounds like an internationalization problem. If you open a Python console, and type float('0.08') and float('0,08') I imagine the latter will work.
