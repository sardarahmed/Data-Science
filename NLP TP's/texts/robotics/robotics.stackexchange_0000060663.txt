did you do rosmake --pre-clean <package_name> ?
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-07:
It doesn't work
I still have the same error
Comment by sai on 2014-07-07:
did you do rosdep install  ? and then roscd takes you to the package..?
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-07:
roscd takes me to another folder : devel
So what is the issue?
Comment by sai on 2014-07-07:
roscd  should take you to the package you are using
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-07:
So what can I do?
I have just deleted everythink and redo the tutorials but I still have the same error
Comment by sai on 2014-07-07:
I tried on my PC running ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte, rosrun diagnostic_aggregator anlyzer_loader runs some program and that means that the executable exists for me. I am not sure what is causing you the problem that the executable does not exist

I am using groovy, does it change anythink?
Comment by sai on 2014-07-07:
I do not think so
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-07:
so what can I do?
Comment by sai on 2014-07-07:
may be provide more information on what the steps you followed and 'exactly' the error that you got and wait till any one else answers it.

I created the .h and .cpp file, then i changed the CmakeList as it is said in the tutorial,  I created the xml file and change the manifest.xml, and then i typed rosmake pr2_motors_analyzer and it says : Built 34 packages with 0 failures. (next just after)
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-08:
(Next) Then I typed rospack plugins --attrib=plugin diagnostic_aggregator and it says : pr2_motors_analyzer /home/lempereur/catkin_ws/src/pr2_motors_analyzer/pr2_motors_analyzer_plugin.xml
diagnostic_aggregator /opt/ros/groovy/share/diagnostic_aggregator/analyzer_plugins.xml  (next just below)
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-08:
And then I created the yaml file and the launch file, and when i typed the rostest command the error appears.
So can someone help me please

A:

I suspect you don't have the diagnostic_aggregator package installed.
If you've using ROS Groovy on Ubuntu, you can install it by running:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-diagnostic-aggregator

EDIT
This is a bug in the diagnostics package; I've filed it here: https://github.com/ros/diagnostics/issues/24
Until it's fixed, you should be able to complete the tutorial by checking the diagnostics package out from source and adding it to your catkin workspace.

Sorry but I don't understand what I have to do.
can you be more specific please?
Thank you

In the src folder of your catkin workspace, do git clone https://github.com/ros/diagnostics.git and then rebuild your workspace.

It works!!!!
Thank you very much!
Comment by goshawk on 2014-07-14:
it doesn't work for me. Roscd diagnostic_updater takes me to a directory under install isolated which doesn't have python libraries in it. I cannot import the diagnostic_updater package in my python code. I have asked the question on my account.

I'm working in c++.
If you can, try to work in c++
Comment by goshawk on 2014-07-15:
I have some nodes or drivers that run in python. What do I do with them?
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-07-16:
@goshawk - please ask a new question with more specifics.
Comment by goshawk on 2014-07-16:
I got it to work by adding packages from source.
