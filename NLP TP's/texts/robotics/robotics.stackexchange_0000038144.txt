A:

I'm not aware of any modules that do that already. I guess you would write a new node and parse the output from command line tools like iw.
You might want to follow https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/trac/ticket/123 and http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Planning/IPC/WiFiNeeds as well. ROS fuerte will have a "better" wifi support (Nick Armstrong-Crews: "We wrote a network monitor to keep track of network health (latency, throughput capacity, signal strength").
