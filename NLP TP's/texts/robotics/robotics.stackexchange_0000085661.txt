Q:

Enable different ROS log levels

I read this tutorial about how to set environment variables to change log level and my config file stayed like this:
 log4j.logger.ros=DEBUG
 log4j.logger.ros.hector_path_follower=DEBUG

ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE variable is properly set, however rosconsole output doesn't show any message.
So I've got two questions:
1- What possible might be wrong?
2- How can I enable ROS_DEBUG output to be viewed on a file/screen, not only through rosconsole
EDIT:
Running roslaunch file outputs:
log4cxx: Could not read configuration file [/home/bruno/rodain].

A:

the error points to a wrong file location. You have to specify the full path to the file, including the file name and file extension. So if your file is not named /home/bruno/rodain, you need to adapt it to the full file name (e.g. /home/bruno/custom_roslog.conf).
By changing the logger level and putting the  output="screen" argument in the respective node tags of your launch file. E.g. <node name="my_node" pkg="my_pkg" type="my_node_executable" output="screen"/>

@mig Your solution resolved my issue. However, ros_console is not displaying any log messages anymore. I've set my config_file to behave like default, not changed though.
