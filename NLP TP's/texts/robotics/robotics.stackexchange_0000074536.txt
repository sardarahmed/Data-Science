Q:

ImportError: No module named QtCore

I have my robot model as a URDF file and when I launch it in a launch file to display it in Rviz, I get the following error :
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/****/first_workspace/src/robot_model/joint_state_publisher/joint_state_publisher/joint_state_publisher", line 6, in <module>
from python_qt_binding.QtCore import Qt

ImportError: No module named QtCore

log file: /home/***/.ros/log/8bb4a410-324b-11e6-812c-480fcf447f3c/joint_state_publisher-2*.log

What could be the issue here?

Please explain why you have a clone of the robot_model source repository in your workspace.

When I checked for the package dependency of robot_model , it was not satisfied. So I decided to clone it in my workspace and try to satisfy all the dependencies. Is that a wrong method?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-06-16:
It depends: by default, you'll want to install binary packages. On Ubuntu, those are installed using apt-get or the Software Centre. Only if you want to develop the package your installing, or are running a system for which no binaries exist, you compile from source.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-06-16:
As to how to then satisfy dependencies (for packages you created yourself, or cloned from someone else): run rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src (after you have sourced the appropriate setup.bash). That installs all dependencies for you.

How do I use apt-get to install binary ROS packages in the root directory?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-06-16:
What is the "root directory"? apt-get will always install packages system-wide. The fact that you run rosdep install .. and point it to your catkin workspace has nothing to do with where it installs packages.
Comment by bhavyadoshi26 on 2016-06-16:
I did the rosdep install .. and all the dependencies were satisfied. But the error still persists. What could be the issue?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-06-16:
Have you removed all the robot_model packages from your catkin_ws/src directory? If you are not planning on working on robot_model or any of its packages, remove it from your workspace. Then run rosdep install ..  again. Then remove your devel and build folder and rebuild your ws.

A:

The last comment of gvdhoorn was the solution. I removed robot_model packages and ran rosdep install .. and then removed the devel and build folders and ran catkin_make. That did the trick.
