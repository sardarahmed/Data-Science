Q:

rrbot_gazebo rrbot.launch - fails when topic laser scan read

Hi,
I am able to launch the rrbot_gazebo rrbot.launch, and able to see the camera, but when I try to read the laser, just > rostopic echo /rrbot/laser/scan, gazebo dies with segfault.
Any idea?

it works with the standard laser plugin, just changing "gpu_ray" x "ray" and "libgazebo_ros_gpu_laser.so" x "libgazebo_ros_laser.so"

@rguzman I tried the same with libgazeboroslaser.so. The simulation starts. When the ray hits an obstacle, the simulation stops with Segmentation Fault. Can you help with this?
