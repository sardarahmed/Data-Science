Q:

MoveIt! Hydro symbol lookup error (Setup Assistant)

Hi,
I am following the moveit tutorial to load pr2.urdf.xacro in MoveIt Setup Assistant.
As I click on Load Files I get the following symbol lookup error:
[librospack]: error while executing command /opt/ros/hydro/lib/moveit_setup_assistant/moveit_setup_assistant: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libmoveit_setup_assistant_widgets.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7console5printEPNS0_10FilterBaseEPvNS0_6levels5LevelEPKciS7_S7_z

Any suggestions on fixing this ?

A:

If you installed MoveIt from source, I would suggest removing the devel and build folders and rebuilding your workspace from scratch.
If you installed from debs, I would update them. There was an issue with a particular release of ros console quite some time ago, which may mean you have outdated debian files.

Hi. I've did the suggested (debs) update, followed by an install of ros-hydro-moveit-full, but the symbol lookup error is still occurring. Any other suggestions on fixing this?
