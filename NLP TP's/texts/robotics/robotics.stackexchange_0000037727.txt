A:

Use this launch file:
 <launch>
   <!-- start gazebo with an empty plane -->
   <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true" />
 
   <node name="gazebo" pkg="gazebo" type="gazebo" args="$(find gazebo_worlds)/worlds/wg.world" respawn="false" output="screen"/>
 
 
   <include file="$(find turtlebot_gazebo)/launch/robot.launch"/>
 </launch>
