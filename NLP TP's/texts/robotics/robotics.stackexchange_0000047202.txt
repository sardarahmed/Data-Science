Q:

[FR] Tags in package documentation

Hello!
Unfortunately I didn't find how to post a feature-request for ros.org site, so post here. (this post is connected to my prev. question(http://answers.ros.org/question/51928/how-to-search-for-ros-packages/?comment=52006#comment-52006).
It seems to be a not bad idea to add a tag field to package manifest ? And then generate tag field on package's documentation page on ros.org site. It'd allowed user to use these tags to search for some specific category of packages.
Thank you in advance
