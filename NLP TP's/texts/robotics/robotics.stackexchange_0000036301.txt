A:

You can solve this issue running the rosbag fix command on your downloaded bag files. The program will work, but still there is going to be some issues with the markers drawing. This issue and its fix is explained here. But have in mind that this fix is only for the demos. If you run the node with your camera, things should be ok. regards.
