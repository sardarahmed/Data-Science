Q:

Explorer Robot ROS/Player interface

Hello all,
I am new to ROS. I haven't done any coding of my own with it, so I reach out to you guys for some help... I have done quite a bit of player work, and I am very familiar with the way it works. I am totally lost with ROS, so if anybody has some tips for C++ programming with Qt 4, that would be very much appreciated.
Primarily, I have a robot with a player driver, but no ROS driver. It is an explorer robot. The driver for it is not part of player, so I need take the player driver and use ROS to manipulate it. I am also trying to communicate with the kinect camera and mount it to the robot. Has anybody done anything related to this?
Thanks everyone!
-Hunter A.

A:

There may already be a ROS Explorer driver from Coroware.
If that is not satisfactory, you can port your Player driver to ROS. There are two methods:

Invoke the Player driver (and libplayer) from a ROS node, as was done for the ROS Erratic driver.

Convert the Player driver to a ROS node. The results are generally clean and easy to maintain. If you are interested in this approach, I can provide hints on how to proceed.
