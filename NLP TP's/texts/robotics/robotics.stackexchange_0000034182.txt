Q:

Unable to install stacks from Kforge

Sorry for the newbie question, but this does not appear to be covered in the StackInstallation tutorial or any other documentation I can find.  When I attempt to install the pr2_mechanism_model (or any other stack whose repository is on kforge), I get the following error:
% svn co https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/hg/file/6d505613a901/pr2_mechanism_model pr2_mechanism_model
svn: The OPTIONS response did not include the requested activity-collection-set; this often means that the URL is not WebDAV-enabled
Any assistance would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Paul.

A:

That stack is using Mercurial, not Subversion.
$ roslocate info pr2_mechanism
- hg:
    local-name: pr2_mechanism
    uri: https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/hg

Try something like:
$ hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/pr2mechanism/hg pr2_mechanism
