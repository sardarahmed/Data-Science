Q:

camera calibration quality

Hi, all!
I am using camera calibration node for monocular camera. Is there any criterion that says how well the camera was calibrated?
And the second question is: should I pass rectified image to some algorithm after calibration or it will be redundant?

A:

According to the official ROS documentation available here  you can check your calibration using cameracheck.py  the following way:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracheck.py --size 8x6 monocular:=/forearm image:=image_rect

Remember that you need to click COMMIT after your calibration is done for the calibration parameters to be uploaded to the camera driver.
