Q:

Sourcing motors by physical dimensions

I have a 1inch square tube that I would like to place a motor into. 
The motor I have takes up approximately 1/2 of the available space (roughly 3/4 inch I.D.) I would like to find the largest motor that will fit in the space without having to cobble too much of a housing. 
Where/how can i find motors by physical dimensions?

A:

Digikey has the ability to sort by physical size (body diameter). I would have thought other sites would offer this as well, but Mouser and Tower Hobbies don't appear to.
