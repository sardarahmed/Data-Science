Q:

Is there a way to adjust the build order of a package in catkin (pcl)?

I am attempting to build ros from source.  while attempting to link pcl_example_extract_clusters_normals I get the error:
/usr/bin/ld cannot find -lpcl_visualization
It looks like visualization has not yet been built and am guessing there is a build order issue.
Alternatively, is there a safe way to make and install a sub-component?

A:

In a default catkin workspace layout (what catkin-make creates), configuration order is done by the build_depend tags in the package.xml, and build ordering can be achieved using add_dependencies() in CMakeLists.txt across packages. So in your case you'd have to find out the exact cmake target name of the pcl_visualization library and use that.
You can go into the build folder and type "make " and press tab to get a list of all targets, this can sometimes be the quicker way to find the name of a target. There should be a command for this as well, if someone knows please add a comment.
In isolated workspaces (what catkin_make_isolated creates), build order is achived using the build_depend tags in the package.xml.

Thank you very much - that did the trick.  I had to add visualization to the SUBSYS_DEPS in .../examples/CMakeLists.txt file and start over.
