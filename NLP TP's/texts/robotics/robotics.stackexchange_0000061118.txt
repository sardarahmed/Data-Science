Q:

Why does SICK LMS200 not work with angle = 180 and resolution = 0.25

Hi all,
I have been trying to perform some laser scanning using LMS200. I am using the sicktoolbox wrapper and setting
rosparam set sicklms/angle 180
rosparam set sicklms/resolution 0.25

But everytime it throws me a warning saying "Unable to set resolution. Using 5.000000e-01 instead of 2.500000e-01" and finally settles with resolution 1.0. However, if I give the combination as (100,0.25) instead of (180,0.25), it works fine and I get the desired resolution. Can anyone throw any light on this strange behavior?
Thanks in advance

A:

I believe that the SICK cannot do it's highest resolution at full width of range. It is bandwidth limited in the amount of samples it can take and report.

Yup, see Table 5-1 on page 11 of the manual. Its max scanning angle is limited to 100 degrees when using an angular resolution of 0.25 degrees.
