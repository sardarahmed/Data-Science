A:

No! ROS is open source (http://www.ros.org/is-ros-for-me/) and if you want to release something as open source as well, you are free to do so.
Check out the bloom documentation which is the release toolchain used in ROS.

Perhaps 'open-source' could use some clarification: wikipedia/zh/open-source.
Comment by NEngelhard on 2016-12-12:
And "open source" -> "commercially usable" is not a valid conclusion!!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-12-12:
@NEngelhard: could you clarify that statement a bit? Are you referring to licensing or code quality (or both)?
Comment by NEngelhard on 2016-12-12:
I was referring to the license. Just being open source is not enough for being commercially usable.
Comment by mgruhler on 2016-12-12:
@NEngelhard @gvdhoorn  good points. But I understood the questions as: "do I have to pay to release a package".
This is a clean "No, you don't have to." Whether the release package is suitable for anything is another matter ;-)
