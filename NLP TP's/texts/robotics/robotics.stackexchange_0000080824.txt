A:

ROS release names are based on / inspired by turtle species names (the animals). I'm not sure they actually 'mean' anything apart from what mental imagery they evoke.
The names are typically chosen after consultation with the community:

ROS H
ROS-I
ROS-J
ROS-K
ROS L
ROS-M

As to why turtles are used, I think it's turtles all the way down.

As for "why turtles", looks like I duplicated/reiterated the question in #q347023 (and came up with a little different answer).
