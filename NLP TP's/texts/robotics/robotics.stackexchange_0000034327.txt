A:

If you take a look here and set up the roscore to run on the workstation and point the TurtleBot's ROS_MASTER_URI to the workstation, you can run the joy node and your teleop node on the workstation and the TurtleBot will receive those commands. Be careful, however, because I've seen significant lag while teleoping over the network, but it will work.
