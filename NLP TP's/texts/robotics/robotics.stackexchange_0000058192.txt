Q:

PR2 upgrade, sources http://packages.willowgarage.com

I just wanted to update - upgrade the robot (with the usual sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade) within the robot. Nonetheless it cannot be done since the robot cannot connect to "http://packages.willowgarage.com" it seems the server has been down since some time already (I tried last week too). Anyone has any workaround this?
In my source files there is no packages.willowgarage.com. So I don't know who is calling this server. I copy the files next.
In my source.list file:
# deb http://aptproxy.willowgarage.com/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main restricted

# deb http://aptproxy.willowgarage.com/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-updates main restricted
# deb http:///ubuntu precise-security main restricted

# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to
# newer versions of the distribution.
deb http://aptproxy.willowgarage.com/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main restricted
deb-src http://aptproxy.willowgarage.com/us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main restricted

## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the
## distribution.

And in my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory I have 3 files (pr2debs.list  pr2debspr2.list  rosdebs.list) and the mix of all is :
deb http://packages.ros.org/pr2/ubuntu precise main
deb http://packages.ros.org/pr2/ubuntu precise pr2
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main

A:

The sources files for PR2 repository are in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
When the ROS packages site moved to OSUOSL last year, Willow lost the ability to update the PR2 repositories hosted there, so the PR2 packages were moved to packages.willowgarage.com, and a redirect was set up to redirect clients from packages.ros.org/pr2 to packages.willowgarage.com/pr2 .
I'm not quite sure what has happened since then, but it looks like redirect is still in place, redirecting you from packages.ros.org/pr2 to packages.willowgarage.com/pr2, and packages.willowgarage.com is offline, which is causing the error you're seeing.
You should contact the PR2 support team directly about this.
