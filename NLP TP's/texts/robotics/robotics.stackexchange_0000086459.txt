Q:

rviz visualization problem

Hi all,
My problem is that rviz will repeat visualizing the planed trajectory and won't stop even the arm is already at the position it should be. I am not sure whether this will cause any problems in the future at least right now I haven't met any problems for it. But I wonder whether there is a way to fix and what is the reason for this phenomenon. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

A:

Click the arrow to expand the "MotionPlanning" visualization in the Displays Tab, open the "Planned Path" section, and use the "Loop Animation" checkbox to toggle this behavior. See image below:
