Q:

How can I use LMS5xx with sicktoolbox2?

I am trying to make a SICK LMS511 work on ROS but I haven't been able to make it work. I am trying to use github /clearpathrobotics/laser_drivers/tree/hydro-devel with no result.
I tried moving the folder of the link above to the ROS path and then run the command rosmake in that folder. Then I tried with roslaunch launch/lms5xx.launch but I get this error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [sicktoolbox_wrapper2/sicklms_5xx]: can't locate node [sicklms_5xx] in package [sicktoolbox_wrapper2]
I know that the laser is well connected.
What should I do?
Thanks!

I have the exact same issue. Does anyone have information on resolving the issue?

A:

You should use Catkin to compile this package.
I highly recommend you to do at least the beginner tutorials :)

Seems that the node doesn't appear even after a catkin_make :(
