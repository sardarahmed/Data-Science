Q:

Hector localization documentation?

Hello
Im trying to use the Hector localization  package. I could compile the package but still is not doing anything. Also the documentation is missing. Is there any example, documentation or helps how to make it works?
Thanks

A:

The author of the package wrote on April 2nd that documentation is still missing, so it's probably still missing..
