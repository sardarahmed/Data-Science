Q:

How to replay .log files faster?

Hello, Is it possible to replay .log files (generated for the vrc) faster? It is veeery slow when i replay here.. actually slower than the run itself (that got an 0.25 real time factor average).
Regards,
LR

A:

I would filter the .log files first then playback, see if that helps. The bottom of this tutorial shows how to use the hz filter. Note that filtering a large log file can take a while though.

I did it.. now it is super fast.. but actuallly faster than it should be. Anyway to control the gazebo update rate so it will run in 1s/s rate?
