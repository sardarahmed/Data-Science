Q:

Resource Not Found: xacro

Hi everyone, I'm new to ROS and currently using indigo on 14.04 LTS.
I have a package called myrobot_description,with launch and urdf folder in it.
i am trying to launch a .launch file to display a urdf model in rviz,but facing this problem after i cd into the launch folder and run roslaunch display.launch
edmond@edmond:~/rosws/src/myrobot_description/launch$ roslaunch display.launch

ResourceNotFound: xacro
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/edmond/rosws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

so basically i suppose the problem here is ResourceNotFound: xacro, can any one help me on this issue?
Thanks a lot in advance!

Edit: as gvdhoom mentioned, the xacro package is missing.i tried installing ros-indigo-xacro, and the problem is half solved.It showed that a urdf_tutorial package is missing and i tried installing ros-indigo-urdf-tutorial, it worked.
Thanks for your instant help.
(btw,it is kind of weird because I've chosen ros full desktop installation, so it should not be any necessary package missing, isn't it?)

A:

Two things:

do you have the xacro package installed?
have you sourced the appropriate setup.bash file?

Also:

i cd into the launch folder and run roslaunch display.launch

while this works (roslaunch can work with (absolute) paths), it's typically better to use the <PKG> <FILE> variant, as that will work from any directory (provided PKG is on the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH). In your case it would become:
roslaunch myrobot_description display.launch

Edit:

btw,it is kind of weird because I've chosen ros full desktop installation, so it should not be any necessary package missing, isn't it?

Yes, that is strange. xacro is supposed to be part of the robot meta-package, which in turn is part of the desktop variant. Installing ros-indigo-desktop should have installed xacro as well. Can you provide some more information on how you installed ROS? Which tutorial (if any) did you follow?
