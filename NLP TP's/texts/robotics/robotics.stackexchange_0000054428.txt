Q:

Tilting Laser Problem : PR2 blocked by a virtual obstacle wall

When I run the pr2_2dnav_slam, the tilting laser seems to have some problem. Therefore the robot will think that it is stuck in the obstacles and won't move.

Then I try to show the tilting laser alone.

It looks like that there are some problem with the transform from the tilting laser to the base_link.
Beside, the laser seems to be wrapped up in a circle, which is very similar to the condition in fig1.
Is there any wrong with the setting of the tilting laser, or what might the problem be?
Thanks for any advise.

A:

I've seen this sort of errors when there's a timing offset between computers on the PR2. The tilting laser is very sensitive to timing offsets since it moves quickly.

I checked the dashboard and found that there are warnings like "NTP offset from c1 to c2 ; Offset too great." Therefore I followed this: pr2support.willowgarage.com/wiki/PR2 Manual/Chapter13#Clock_Synchronization, and sync the clock. After that the problem disappeared!! Thank you very much~

I wonder why the tilting laser is sensitive to the timing offset? How does the timing offset interact with the system that finally result in such phenomenon.
