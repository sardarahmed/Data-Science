Q:

cannot find package error

Hi all,
I'm trying to use hector_quadrotor stack to simulate the UAV.  However I met some problems when I roslaunch the file spawn_quadrotor.launch which in the package hector_quadrotor_urdf. This is what I see:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [odometry_to_tf/odometry_to_tf]: Cannot locate node of type [odometry_to_tf] in package [odometry_to_tf]
I have already executed the command " rosdep install odometry_to_tf " and " rosmake odometry_to_tf " . Also I can find the package odometry_to_tf by typing command roscd.
Thank you very much for your help!!

@Lorenz Thank you for your advice. But it didn't work. I have installed the hector_localication stack, nothing happened.  Do you have any ideas?
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-03-29:
How did you install the stack? Did you install the trunk version? Is it present in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?

A:

odometry_to_tf is not a debian package but a ROS package, so rosdep will not install it. roslocate info odometry_to_tf shows the following output:
- svn:
    local-name: odometry_to_tf
    uri: http://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/hector_localization/odometry_to_tf

Install the stack hector_localication, do a rosmake and odometry_to_tf should be there.
