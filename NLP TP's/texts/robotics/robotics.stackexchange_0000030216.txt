Q:

multiple subscriptions ignoring messages [updated]

Hello,
My node is listening to 2 kinects on 8 topics for messages. Even though messages are published on all topics only 4 of the callbacks are invoked. I tried changing the LOOP_RATE, increased the QUEUE size but doesn't make a difference. Is there something I am doing wrong or missing?
Here's the code that I was running: listener.cpp
And here are my launch files for kinects:
Kinect1_openni_node.launch, Kinect2_openni_node.launch, kinect_frames1.launch , kinect_frames2.launch
Here's my rxgraph

When I run listener.cpp , all I get is the following i.e. it skips messages from 4 topics
[ INFO] [1299768991.573907570]: Depth Image: [2]
[ INFO] [1299768991.580039704]: Kinect1 Depth Image: [6]

Thanks for any help.
Best,

@Tully & @ Felix Endres: I've updated my question as requested. Please let me know your opinion. Thank you.

It's impossible to say, unless you at least tell us which topics you subscribed to.
Comment by Tully on 2011-03-09:
Please add more information to help us debug.  Such as sample code, launch files, outputs of rxgraph, and appropriate rostopic hz.  This sounds like a configuration issue not a code issue.

A:

Depending on what settings you have configured the Kinect with it does not necessarily publish on all advertised topics.  Some are mutually exclusive.
I recommend that you look at what settings you have configured using rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui  and the documentation in openni_camera

While this is true, i think these topics are not the mono/rgb image and the clouds. I have no better idea though.
