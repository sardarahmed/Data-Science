Q:

How can I make VS Code recognize ros2 python packages?

When working with python launch files, VS Code always complaints about  unresolved imports, such as  unresolved import 'launch' and unresolved import 'launch_ros.actions'. Of course, this also means I don't have access to IntelliSense.
How can I make VS Code recognize ros2 python packages?

HI,
The easiest way to work with VS Code is to use the Visual Studio Code Extension for ROS
If you have it installed,  just make sure you source the ROS setup (i.e. /opt/ros//setup.bash) or your workspace (install/setup.bash) before running VS code. It should recognize all the ROS components then,

If ROS2 is running in a Docker container, with VSCode using the remote containers extension, I cannot find a way to source ROS before VSCode opens. As a fix, I have installed the ROS extension.

In .vscode/settings.json, add the
following:

"ros.distro": "foxy"

In .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json, add
this to the includePath list:

"/opt/ros/foxy/include/**"

If you are using Docker containers with VS Code, I'll definitely recommend you to check this:  vscode-docker-ros2
