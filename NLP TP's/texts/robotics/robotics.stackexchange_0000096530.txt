Q:

Visualization with rtabmap

In rtabmap, should we always include the rtabmapviz node along with the rtabmap node?
I had an experience like, I forgot to remap my odom topic in rtabmapviz parameters and the robot did not detect any loop closures. When I included that, the robot detects loop closures really well.
I do not understand how this happens. Isn't rtabmapviz supposed to be aiding with visualization only?
I'm a complete beginner and I would really appreciate if you can give me a detailed explanation.
Thank you..!

A:

rtabmapviz is like a mix of rviz and rqt_reconfigure functionalities specific to rtabmap, it is not required for rtabmap node. Loop closures are detected in rtabmap node, rtabmapviz just shows them. If loop closures were not detected without remapping odom topic for rtabmapviz, the problem is somewhere else. Did odom topic also remapped for rtabmap node? rtabmap node shows by default an update log at 1 Hz in terminal when running.

odom topic was remapped in rtabmap node already. I'm not sure how that really worked just by changing in rtabmapviz. I think there might be some problem with GPU.
