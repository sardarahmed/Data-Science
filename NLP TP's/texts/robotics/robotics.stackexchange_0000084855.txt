Q:

web_video_server installation

I installed web_video_server using the command
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-web-video-server

but trying to run it with rosrun web_video_server web_video_server gives this error:
/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/web_video_server/web_video_server: error while loading shared libraries: libopencv_core3.so.3.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I'm pretty sure I have opencv installed.
Running pkg-config --cflags opencv-3.2.0-dev gives the following output:
-I/opt/ros/kinetic/include/opencv-3.2.0-dev/opencv -I/opt/ros/kinetic/include/opencv-3.2.0-dev

Is web-video-server looking for version 3.3? How would I update to that?
I'm running ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04
