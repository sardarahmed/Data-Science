Q:

In Eclipse, I'm trying to set a breakpoint, but only getting a 'set bookmark name' popup

Hi
Not sure if this is due to mixing Eclipse with ROS, but while trying to set a breakpoint by double clicking in the left border of the editor on a line in my C++ code I keep getting a popup menu for setting a bookmark name. Right mouse clicking in the left border displays a menu to add a bookmark or a task. This occurs both in the C/C++ and Debug perspectives.
I am able to run the program in Eclipse to completion, I would just like to get use to using the debugging facilities before moving on to more complicated stuff.
I have Eclipse v 4.4.1, running on Ubuntu 12.04. and it is setup (through the use of catkin) to develop ROS (hydro) apps as described at http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#Eclipse
Any suggestions would be appreciated, thanks...

Nothing to do with ROS.

A:

In going back to my development, when I started a debug session, in the upper right hand corner of the debug perspective there is a breakpoints view - this showed that the breakpoints I tried to set actually did get set, even though I didn't get the popup window I was expecting. So, it doesn't work as shown in the tutorials I've seen but it does allow breakpoints. I am considering this solved.
