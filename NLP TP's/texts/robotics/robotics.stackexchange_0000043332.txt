Q:

What's the meaning of rosws merge?

I followed rosjava_core 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT documentation.
What's the meaning of this command?
  rosws merge /opt/ros/electric/.rosinstall

Is it suitable for any ROS version?
Thank you~

A:

rosws merge merges your local .rosinstall with another rosinstall file. Often projects define several stacks or packages to download from different sources in a single xyz.rosinstall file. Rather than copying the contents of that file into your local .rosinstall file, you can use rosws merge.
Calling
rosws merge foo.rosinstall

is equivalent to calling
rosinstall . foo.rosinstall

The rosws command works with any ROS version.
Also see the rosws documentation:

I have already install ROS electric. Why I still need to rosinstall /opt/ros/electric/.rosinstall ? Thank you~

Please have a look at the ros overlay installation page for more information on how to properly set up a ros overlay. You need to merge /opt/ros/electric/.rosinstall to your current workspace if you want to use stacks installed as debian pkgs.

I understand I always use a cumbersome way of ROS. But I still don't understand what's the effect of rosinstall /opt/ros/electric/.rosinstall? Thank you~

A ros workspace is a directory that contains a .rosinstall file that points to all repositories you installed from source, to local directories that should be part of your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. rosws merge merges the content of another rosinstall file with your workspace.

So what your meaning is 'rosws merge' generate the .rosinstall which has all paths including /opt/ros/electric/.rosinstall, then I add setup.bash to bashrc in order to replace the path of /opt/ros/electric/.rosinstall? Thank you~
