Q:

Invalid arguments, Convert from Quaternion to Euler

Hi everyone,
I used the section code for convert from Quaternion to Euler as :
void Nav::compassCallback(const sensor_msgs::Imu::ConstPtr& msg)
{
    // Convert quaternion to RPY.
    btQuaternion q;
    double roll, pitch, yaw;
    tf::quaternionMsgToTF(msg->orientation, q);
    btMatrix3x3(q).getRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);
    ROS_DEBUG("RPY = (%lf, %lf, %lf)", roll, pitch, yaw);
} // end compassCallback()

I get it from:
link text
but I got this error from Eclipse :
Invalid arguments '
Candidates are:
void getRPY(float &, float &, float &, unsigned int)
'
I tried to used make on console on ROS and everything was good without error.

A:

If everything worked when you compiled using make in the terminal, it's probably just a problem with Eclipse which you can safely ignore.
However, the code above won't work with Fuerte since TF now provides its own data types. The corresponding code looks like this:
void Nav::compassCallback(const sensor_msgs::Imu::ConstPtr& msg)
{
    // Convert quaternion to RPY.
    tf::Quaternion q;
    double roll, pitch, yaw;
    tf::quaternionMsgToTF(msg->orientation, q);
    tf::Matrix3x3(q).getRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);
    ROS_DEBUG("RPY = (%lf, %lf, %lf)", roll, pitch, yaw);
} // end compassCallback()
