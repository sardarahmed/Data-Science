Q:

SBC Environment Setup

Hi.
I got an trouble when I followed the instruction below.
link text
16.2.7.1 Domain ID Allocation
I made a mistake when typing commands.
I wrote  echo 'source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setp.bash' >> ~/.bashrc by mistake. (setup>>setp)
I wrote correct commands and rebooted, but
home/ubuntu/turtlebot3_ws/install/setp.bash: No such file or directory  appears.
Do you know how to delete the history that  I wrote the incorrect commands ?

A:

What the echo 'source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setp.bash' >> ~/.bashrc command does is writing source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setp.bash at the end of the ~/.bashrc file.
To correct it you need to edit (with a text editor, e.g. nano) the ~/.bashrc file and modify the line from setp.bash to setup.bash
