Could you be more specific about what you want to run in VirtualBox? Basic roscpp? Navigation? Rviz? Gazebo? etc

A:

In general ROS programs run fine inside Virtual Box, except for programs which use hardware accelerated video. The effectiveness of accelerated video depends a lot on your setup, host and hardware.
The other thing to be careful about when working in a VM is the availability and connectivity of the networking.  The problems are mostly about making sure that you have configured things right, not that it won't work.
