I am master student, working on ros and rosjava project.
I was using android_sensors_driver from android store, and it was great.
I want to modified android_sensors_driver, and re-compile it.
I compiled all the other libraries: rosjava, and android core, with catkin_make (catkin build system).
I change build.gradle at android_sensor_driver, and now it find all the dependencies:
http://en.textsave.org/bEtb
but still, it not fully compile.
and if you can look the errors that i get after modified the build.gradle:
http://en.textsave.org/aEtb
can you help me please?
I feel i am so close, but need the final touch.
Thanks for your time,
Tal Regev.
