Q:

rosserial_arduino catkin_make error: unparsed argument: Port;/dev/ttyACM0

I am trying to get the rosserial_arduino tutorial to work (tutorial here).
The only change I made was to change the board type from "leonardo" to "OpenCR" since I want to use the Robotis OpenCR board.
The execution of catkin_make helloworld_firmware_hello gives me the following error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosserial_arduino/arduino-cmake/cmake/Platform/Arduino.cmake:2073 (message):
  unparsed argument: Port;/dev/ttyACM0
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosserial_arduino/arduino-cmake/cmake/Platform/Arduino.cmake:739 (error_for_unparsed)
  /opt/ros/noetic/share/rosserial_arduino/arduino-cmake/cmake/Platform/Arduino.cmake:459 (parse_generator_arguments)
  CMakeLists.txt:7 (generate_arduino_firmware)

Has anyone else encountered this problem before?
My ROS-noetic install is from yesterday, so everything should be up to date.

A:

I think /dev/ttyACM0 does not exist.
Without connecting the Arduino to the machine running ROS, /dev/ttyACM0 will not appear. Also, depending on the Arduino, it may have a different name, such as /dev/ttyUSB0.
UPDATE
I watched the tutorial. I think you're making a typo.
Did you type the semicolon incorrectly?
Port;/dev/ttyACM0 -> PORT /dev/ttyACM0

The port is correct. When I plug in the board I the device /dev/ttyACM0 appears just as expected.
While executing the catkin_make the board was plugged into my machine.
