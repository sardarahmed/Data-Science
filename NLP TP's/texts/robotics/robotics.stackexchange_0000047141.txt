Q:

Disabling unused streams for openni_launch

I am using openni_launch to start my kinect. Per default it publishes a lot of topics (IR, Depth, RGB in mono, rectified, registered, compressed, theora versions).
I would be interested if it is possible to disable the unused topics per launch file to increase performance? Or is it necessary to change the sources?
Thanks in advance

Comment by felix k on 2013-01-11:
Don't expect to much performance incrementation if any at all; Usually those topics' computations are paused if no node is subscribed. The kinect isn't even switched on until someone subscribes. (Beside that, your question is valid)

A:

As felix says, there shouldn't really be a performance difference, since processing won't be done unless a particular topic is subscribed to. It would be possible to add arguments to openni.launch to disable launching of certain nodelets (and therefor get rid of certain topics), but there are already a fair number of arguments to the launchfiles and I'd rather not add more.
