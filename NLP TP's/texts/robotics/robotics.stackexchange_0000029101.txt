Q:

Is Gazebo capable of procedural generated textures?

I was wondering if one can use procedural generated textures, like the cloud feature in Blender, inside Gazebo.
Is it possible without any plugins?
Would this be possible for textures and also height map?
Update:
I found in OGRE only a plugin to use procedural generated stuff.
So I dont think it is possible but I am still not 100% sure about it.

I'm not sure but I don't think that GAZEBO is capable of that.
