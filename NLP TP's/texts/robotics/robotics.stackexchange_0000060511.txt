Q:

Could not find executable running image_view from rosrun

I've been using image_view to see the contents of image topics for some time, but I encountered a problem and I have no idea what the cause is. Here's what I get when trying to check an image topic:
Command I typed:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/...(topic)
Terminal output:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named image_view below /opt/ros/hydro/share/image_view
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files, or not executable:
[rosrun] /opt/ros/hydro/share/image_view
It shouldn't be a source problem. Many other programs can run normaly.
I would really appreciate your help. Thanks!

A:

If you installed it using Debian try deleting it and reinstalling it, maybe it will be the fastest way to solve your problem.
sudo apt-get remove ros-hydro-image-view

and then
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-image-view

Otherwise delete everything called image_view manually and reinstall it using apt-get.
