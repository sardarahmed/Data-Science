Q:

Kinect colored object localization (detection)

Hello all dear friends,
I am new in ROS and Kinect, and I want to DETECT a COLORED OBJECT (i.e a res sphere), I need it's POSITION (x, y, z) but not in image (CMVISION does this already), I tried to see all the previous questions but I did not find my answer and also I read the tutorial I tried to use RGBD_SLAM, VISION_VISP ... but I had problem with them..
Any body had same experience? any short message also could help me a lot.
Thank you
Hamed

A:

With depth registration turned on, you can use cmvision to detect an object in the RGB image, and then use the pixel coordinates to lookup the (x,y,z) position in the point cloud.

I used the CMVISION, and it workes perfectly, but still I have problem to transfer the image coordinates to world coordinates.... as you told me I should use PIXEL COORDINATES.... but I am really new in PCL, if you had already done this, can you give me some hints?
THanks you in advance...
