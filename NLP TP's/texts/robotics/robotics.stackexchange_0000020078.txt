Q:

Why in trajectory planning in joint space the manipulator never crosses a singularity?

I am studying robotics kinematics and I have studied that if we plan a trajectory in joint space it is impossible for the robot manipulator to cross a singularity during its motion, while in cartesian space this is possible.
But why in joint space the manipulator never meet a singularity?

A:

The term "singularity" characterizes those configurations in the joint space where the Jacobian matrix loses rank and thus it is not directly invertible.
The Jacobian, in turn, is used to remap a trajectory from the Cartesian space to the joint space.
Therefore, if you plan the trajectory straight in the joint space, then you are not going to use the Jacobian and, as a consequence, you will not have to deal with singularities.
