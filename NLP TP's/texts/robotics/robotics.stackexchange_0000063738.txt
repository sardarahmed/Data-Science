Q:

Ros Programming how to open my saved map

Hi guys. I have a problem. I am beginner at ROS Programming. I use RVIZ for mapping.

I mapped with Turtlebot using this tutorial: link text . Then next day I tried to open my map using this tutorial: link text but my map didn't open. I can't understand how I will solve this problem.

I see that Turtlebot can't localize itself truly on the map when after I open the map at the same day.

do you see map in rviz ? or map is not loaded ?
Comment by ros_master on 2014-11-02:
For the first question, map file does not appear in directory which i saved map, this situation happens when i shut down the computer.
For the second question map is loaded but robot can not find its location on the appearing map.

for 2. are you able to see localisation running ?

A:

rosrun map_server map_saver -f /tmp/my_map
saves my_map.pgm in /tmp folder which will be cleared on every reboot.
just do rosrun map_server map_saver -f my_map ,it will save map in current folder
or change saving path. rosrun map_server map_saver -f /..your..path.../my_map

Thank you very much !!  I solved the problem in the first question. In the second question, while running robot can localize truly. Robot moves in wrong directions but after I closed the map.

Localisation problem : When i move forward robot by using teleoperation, it goes wrong direction in map.
Comment by ros_master on 2014-11-03:
In rviz, there are global and local maps, when robot moves, global map coordinates does not change but local ones change, so which coordinates should i use to move robot from somewhere to another where.
