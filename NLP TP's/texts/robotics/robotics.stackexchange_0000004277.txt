Q:

What is the difference between screw and wrench in rigid body motion?

A screw is defined by a six dimensional vector of forces and torques. It can represent any spatial movement of a rigid body (as written here). But I don't get the following distinction between screw and wrench: 

The force and torque vectors that arise in applying Newton's laws to a rigid body can be assembled into a screw called a wrench. 

It seems to be some kind of contextualisation but in what way?

A:

I will try to make it as simple as possible. Imagine you have a SCREW, when you WRENCH it, it TWIST forward or backward.
From your wiki link

The components of the screw define the Pl√ºcker coordinates of a line in space and the magnitudes of the vector along the line and moment about this line.

It means that any system can be described as those coordinate system is a screw. For example a normal screw has it axis and it pitch. 
A WRENCH is one case of SCREW where the act (force or torque) have the axis and yield a movement (translation or rotation)
You can have a look at the slide of the Summer Screw Summer School for more detail.
