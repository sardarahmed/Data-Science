Q:

Difference between depth and depth_registered?

When you launch the freenect node there are topics with camera/depth/(SOMETHING) and camera/depth_registered/(SOMETHING). What is the difference between these two things?

A:

In short:
depth_registered a cloud where each point is coloured (with the colour taken from the 2D image).
depth is a point cloud with no colour info.
