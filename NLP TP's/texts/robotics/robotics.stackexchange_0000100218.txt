Q:

[SOLVED] How do I control 2 dynamixel motors simultaneously using a service?

I could only send for one motor at a time...
dynamixel_workbench_msgs::DynamixelCommand srv;

srv.request.id = // 2 ids;
srv.request.addr_name = â€œGoal_Position";
srv.request.value = // 2 values;

if (goal_dynamixel_command_client_.call(srv))
{
  return srv.response.comm_result;
}

A:

All I did was to edit the service file (by duplicating the 3 arguments) and dynamixel_workbench_controllers.cpp under function dynamixelCommadMsgCallback (using a loop). Next, remove the build and devel folders, and build your packages all over again.
