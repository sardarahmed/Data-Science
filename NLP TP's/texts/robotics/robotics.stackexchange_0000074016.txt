Q:

KUKA Youbot navigation simulation

Hello, 
I want to apply navigation with a Youbot in simulation. I used the simulator provided by ROS and I launch it with the following command: 
roslaunch youbot_gazebo_robot youbot.launch
But when I try to move the robot after doing the following indications to bring up the navigation stack: http://wiki.ros.org/youbot_navigation , the robot doesn't move. I have some errors with the hokuyo_node.
I found that the youbot_oodl package provided here: https://github.com/youbot/youbot-ros-pkg/tree/master/youbot_drivers/youbot_oodl is not functional (the OODL include files are missing).
If someone can help me, I will be grateful,
lfr

A:

A collaborator and I had gotten that working a few months ago, but not using the official youbot_navigation that you mentioned. Instead, take a look at this: https://github.com/pschillinger/youbot_integration it might help (You can safely ignore the "behavior" stuff; it's specific to our project.)

Thank you, I'll try that

I used  the launch inside the youbot_navigation package but I have a problem. When I try to move the robot, the arm moves instead of the base. But the problem doesn't come from your package (the same problem appears with my own nodes).

It's okay, I found my mistake. I used base_link intead of odom as fixed frame. It works correctly now. Thanks again.

Sorry, I have another problem, I cannot see obstacles in the costmap and I don't know why. Can you help me ?

I'm pretty sure we have not configured the costmaps fully. Take a look at https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_ros/tree/indigo-devel/fetch_navigation and https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_apps/tree/indigo/turtlebot_navigation for examples of how to configure them.

Thanks, I found where is the error: I replaced the map_type value which was voxel to costmap and it works.
Thank you again.

i can't compile the packages because of an error :invalid new-expression of abstract class type ‘steered_wheel_base_controller::SteeredWheelBaseController’
return new C;
have you some tips?

i solved that prblem, but now i'm stucked on this:
Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to odom to become available before running costmap, tf error: canTransform: target_frame odom does not exist.. canTransform returned after 0.1 timeout was 0.1.
it's my first simulation
