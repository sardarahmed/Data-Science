Q:

LaserScanAngularBoundsFilter not work

Hi all,
I tried to bound the angle of LaserScan output  from -1.57~+1.57 to -0.5~+0.5.
But it just not work..  Here is my yaml.
    $ cat my_laser_config.yaml 
    scan_filter_chain:
    - name: angular_bounds
      type: LaserScanAngularBoundsFilter
      params:
        lower_angle: -0.5
        upper_angle: 0.5

The output topic "/scan_filtered" is still the same messages with input topic..
Any suggestion??

That project seems to be out of maintained.
I just wrote my custom angular bound filter, and it works fine
