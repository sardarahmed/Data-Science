A:

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29 shows you how to publish a string message using C++. You will need to choose an appropriate message type to publish the values you want instead of String, import that message definition instead and set the fields then publish it
