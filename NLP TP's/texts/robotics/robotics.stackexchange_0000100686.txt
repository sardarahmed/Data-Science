Q:

[Solved]How specify OpenCV version in cv_bridge

Hi everyone. I'm in ROS Melodic and I'm working with OpenCV 4.5.3 for xfeatures2d. At the end of catkin_make, i have this warnings:
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libopencv_imgproc.so.4.5, needed by /usr/local/lib/libopencv_xfeatures2d.so.4.5.3, may conflict with libopencv_imgproc.so.3.2

I've seen many questions for this warnings, that suggest to clone cv_bridge from source code. But I don't understand I specify OpenCV version in my cv_bridge. I've tried to change CMakeFile of cv_bridge like this:
find_package(OpenCV 3 REQUIRED -> find_package(OpenCV 4 REQUIRED
but can't build.

A:

I found a solution in Github:
In catkin_ws/src:
git clone https://github.com/fizyr-forks/vision_opencv/tree/opencv4
cd vision_opencv
git checkout opencv4
