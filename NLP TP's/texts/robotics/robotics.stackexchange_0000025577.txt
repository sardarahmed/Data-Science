Q:

Reset pose to reset velocities

If I were to tinker in the file reset_pose.py and add lines about resetting other states than just the positions, could I also zero out the velocities of the joint states?  For example, when I move the waist joint to rotate the robot, it sways around due to the controller being underdamped.  If I just hit 'reset pose', the robot might snap back to a certain position, but it won't have zero velocity at the joints.  But if I published additional commands in the reset, I could take that out, right?

A:

Sorry I am unclear what you are trying to achieve here.
But in general, reset_pose.py only works with atlas_position_controllers.launch by setting controllers desired joint positions.  Once the published commands are received by individual position controllers, each controller will actuate the joints towards desired position.
The Reset Model Poses button in the GUI simply resets the Model pose, and leaves model joint configuration untouched, the model is "teleported" to its starting pose, but the dynamic properties (linear and angular velocities of the links) are unchanged.
