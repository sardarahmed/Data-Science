Q:

dpptam image transport

I am getting this error running dpptam with a live feed from webcam. I see others with this same error posted around but under different circumstances relating to image transport and ubuntu 16. Can anyone comment of this issue ? Thank you.
[ERROR] [1495577785.773462409]: Compressed Depth Image Transport - Compression requires single-channel 32bit-floating point or 16bit raw depth images (input format is: bgr8).

A:

This appears to be a misunderstanding on my part. Apparently you get this error if you subscribe to a image topic that is not published or is of the wrong type that uses image transport.
