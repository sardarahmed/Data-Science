Q:

How to use an external library with a rosjava

Hi,
I am trying to modify the example: Talker.java to use an external library saved as .jar
In eclipse, I have updated buildPath, but when I execute roscore, system doesn't run.
I am not sure if I have to add some line in build.xml or the dependencies.xml
In build.xml I added:
  <path id="classpath">
    <pathelement path="${ros.compile.classpath}" />
    <pathelement location="/usr/local/lejos/lib/pc/pccomms.jar" />
  </path>

But roscore fails too.
How to solve my problem?
Happy new year
Cheers

A:

I solved the problem updating manifest.xml
  <export>
    <!-- 
    <rosjava-src location="src/main/java" />
     -->
    <rosjava-src location="src" /> 
    <rosjava-pathelement location="target/" groupId="org.ros" artifactId="org.ros.rosjava.tutorial.pubsub" version="0.0.0" built="true" />
    <rosjava-pathelement location="/usr/local/lejos/lib/pc/pccomm.jar" />
 </export>

Excuse me what is the "target/" directory in this case?
