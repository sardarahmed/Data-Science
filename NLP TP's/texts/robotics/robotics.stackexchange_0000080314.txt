Q:

How to remove or respawn robots during the simulation?

Hi everyone
I am a new ros user. Currently, I am implementing an algorithm by using Ros platform with Gazebo simulator. I will use a group of robot (at least 10 hector quadrotors) for the simulations. And under some certains conditions, the robot need to be removed or respawned during the simulation.
I use .cpp file as a rosnode to run the controllers (algorithm) for all robots. Does anyone know how to realize this dynamic removal or respawn through .cpp file? or .launch file?
Thank you very much
