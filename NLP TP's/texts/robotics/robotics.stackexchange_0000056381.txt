Q:

"Interact" Button in MoveIt.RViz Plugin

I was working through the MoveIt tutorials in which I launched the PR2 configuration demo using the RViz plugin and saw how you could use the 6-DOF interactive markers to move the robot joints.  I then tried to do the same thing for my robot, but the interactive markers don't appear.  Nothing happens when I click on the "Interact" button in RViz.  The button is selected but my mouse cursor still displays as the camera control cursor.
How can I check to see what's preventing RViz from allowing me to interact with my robot?

A:

Well, I should note that I did not have an end effector defined. However, the interactive markers appeared after defining one.

By your answer I was able to fix the same issue. Notice that parent group is necessary for the eef definition.
