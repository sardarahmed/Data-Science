Q:

ros_controller not making -indigo

Hello,
I am trying to make my own costume robot in gazebo. I have been following this tutorials
http://www.generationrobots.com/en/content/75-gazebo-and-ros
http://www.romin.upm.es/wiki/index.php?title=ROS%3ATutorials/Simulate_Your_Robot_in_Gazebo
But when I try to run
catkin_make

I get the following error
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros_control" with
any of the following names:
ros_controlConfig.cmake
ros_control-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros_control" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ros_control_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ros_control" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  omni_shot/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

This is my CMakeList.txt
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  rospy
  std_msgs
  controller_manager 
  ros_control
  ros_controllers
  
)

Do I need to include ros_controller and ros_controllers? When I remove them I get thses errors,
[ERROR] [1451315533.235070013, 0.140000000]: No valid hardware interface element found in joint 'front_right_wheel_joint'.

I have been stuck on this for over a day, can anyone please help me? I am very confused.

A:

CMake is telling you that it can't find the ros_control package.
You should try installing it:
On Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-control

Or on other operating systems, checkout the ros_control package from github: https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control into your catkin workspace.
