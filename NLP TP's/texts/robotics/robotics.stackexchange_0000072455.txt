Q:

rosmaster dies all nodes need to restart

I am finding that if the the rosmaster node is rebooted on one machine and rosmaster is restarted I am finding I am having to restart all the other nodes on the remaining computer. Is their some how a way to prevent the need to restart the other nodes.

A:

I think this is not possible, when a node starts it will registers the topic it listens/subscribes to the rosmaster. So once the master is killed, the connection is lost. You might use roslaunch to easily start/stop the whole thing
