Q:

remove rqt left corner 'x - []' icons

I plan to use rqt on a raspberry touch panel which is apparently smaller than a pc. I'd like to realize two modifications,

Let the rqt automatically fit to the size of the raspberry screen once launched from terminal.
Given that a launch file is used to start the rqt and fill it to the size of the screen, I want to remove the icons 'close, minimize and maximize' on the left corner of rqt because they look redundent to these simliar icons on the raspberry display.

A:

The icons in the top left corner of the window are coming from the window manager. Those are not specific to rqt / ros / qt but the window manager you use on your system. Depending on what platform you are that might be Unity, Gnome, etc. Maybe that helps you direct your search.
