Q:

Can ROS work with a Intel® Xeon Prozessor E5620?

Hi,
we use a HP Z600, which has two Intel® Xeon Prozessor E5620 using Ubuntu 18.04.
My question is:
Can we run ROS Melodic on this constellation ?
We appreciate your answers.
Thank you.

A:

that's a standard amd64 compatible x86 CPU with 4 cores, so the answer would be: yes.
See REP-3: Target Platforms for ROS 1 supported CPU architectures, and REP-2000: ROS 2 Releases and Target Platforms for ROS 2 supported CPU architectures.
What made you post this question? Did you read anything which made you ask it?
Note btw: as always with these kind of questions: we can only answer whether the code/binaries are compatible with the CPU architecture. Whether the performance of the specific CPU you mention would be sufficient for your use-cases we cannot say, as only you know those use-cases.

At :
http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
is written, that:

Ubuntu packages are built for the following distros and architectures.

For Distro, Artful and Bionic are only amd64, arm64 and armhf accredited.
So I asked that question, because nowhere is written, that Intel processor are allowed.
Thanks for the quick answer :)

amd64 is the generic name for every x86-64 compatible processor architecture. It's not specific to AMD. Intel uses the same name. See wikipedia/X86-64.
