Q:

Mobius camera interface in ROS

Hi,
I would like to work with mobius actioncam and ROS on nvidia tegra tk1. I've tried both uvc_camera and usb_cam packages but without success. uvc_camera gives me this error: "I only handle discrete frame intervals" and usb_cam just dies.
Did anyone try mobius camera on tk1?
Edit: The behavior is the same on my computer. Is there even mobius driver for ROS?

well, have you found anything?
More general though: can you open the camera in something like cheese or guvcview?

I tried displaying camera output in vlc and it works just fine. I think I'll probably have to write my own interface to get it working with ROS...

Oh, didn't know that srry. I tried guvcview and it works. I will have a look at gscam then.

A:

I specifically asked about guvcview and cheese because they use the same uvc interface as uvc_camera and libuvc_camera. VLC could be using v4l or v4l2.
You could take a look at gscam.
