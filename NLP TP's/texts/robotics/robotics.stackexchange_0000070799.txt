The default location of the executable shouldn't be in your src directory if you're following the tutorials. Did you forget to source the setup.bash file from your devel directory?

hi,
when your using your own package called "beginner2_tutorials" i think you have completed the normal "beginner_tutorials" ? Is this so,and was the result, that you could run it ?
have you sourced your devel/setup.bash file before running rosrun ?

yes i have run true my mistake was catkin_make and before this , i should make msg and srv folder.

thank you for reply

A:

hi , thanks for all helps all of my fault  was mkdir msg and srv so after make them and did the catkin_make again i could see
Linking CXX executable /home/fatima/catkin_ws2/devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/talker
Linking CXX executable /home/fatima/catkin_ws2/devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/listener

so two executable files with name talker and listener were made in catkin_ws2/devel/lib/beginner_tutorials
so when i run rosrun beginner2_tutorials talker again i could receive the result true
run catkin_make is so important .

I still didn't get you. I am having the same problem, and I am not able to resolve, can you elaborate on the steps?
