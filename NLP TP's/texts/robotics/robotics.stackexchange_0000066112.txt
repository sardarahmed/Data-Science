Q:

Tutorials: Writing Simple Server Client Bug?

Hello,
so I'm doing the tutorials and I got a problem in this one.
Where do you get this file? #include "beginner_tutorials/AddTwoInts.h"?
I know that you have to go back look at  creating the AddTwoInts.srv Tutorial.
But my problem is how do you get the .h file?
This file is needed for both service and client.

A:

You don't need to find it.
It is going to be created during compiling. To do that add the following line in your cmakelists
add_executable(add_two_ints_server src/add_two_ints_server.cpp)
target_link_libraries(add_two_ints_server ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(add_two_ints_server beginner_tutorials_gencpp)    // <= you need this line 

from here.
Of course it is mandatory to create at first your srv file in the project folder as described here.
In the right order:

create the srv file and add it into your cmakelists;
add the above line as at the beginning suggested (to tell the compiler to generate the needed .h file at first);
compile with catkin_make;
