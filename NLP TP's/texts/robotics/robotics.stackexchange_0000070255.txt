Q:

How can I set common cmake flags for all my packages?

I want to setup cxx compiler flags common for all my packages, but I can't edit CMakeLists.txt in my catkin workspace folder. I can edit only separate catkin packages CMakeLists.txt. What should I do?

A:

You can pass cmake options to catkin_make, e.g., catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug.
