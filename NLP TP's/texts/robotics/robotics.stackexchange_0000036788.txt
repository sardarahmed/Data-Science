Q:

Installing Openni kinect drivers

Hello,
I am having trouble installing openni drivers.  When I follow the instructions "hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers" the response is: destination directory: drivers
abort: Permission denied.  If I got to the website https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers , it turns out to be a openni-drivers:log.  Ive tried several times over a period of time so now I'm not sure what to do.  I know that this issue was address last June, but answers given didn't help me out.  Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Gene

A:

Where are you checking this code out on your computer?
Is suspect the error is on your side and you don't have writing permissions in the location that you are checking out. (It works for me without errors.)
