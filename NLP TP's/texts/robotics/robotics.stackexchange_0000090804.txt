Q:

Moveit Setup Assistant cant locate all meshes

Hi @ all,
I created a package in a new workspace. Inside this package I have an URDF Folder with my xacro for the robot.
The URDF uses package:// to locate the meshes:
<mesh filename="package://motoman_es200/meshes/visual/es200_base_lowres.dae"/>

The strange thing is:
The es200_base_lowres.dae is found and viewed in Rviz (moveit setup)
But the following meshes not.
<mesh filename="package://motoman_es200/meshes/visual/es200_saxis_lowres.dae"/>

Output (snipped):
Error retrieving file [file:///home/harry/xs_robot/src/motoman_es200/meshes/collision/es200_saxis_lowres.dae]:
Couldn't open file /home/harry/xs_robot/src/motoman_es200/meshes/collision/es200_saxis_lowres.dae

Rospack finds my package
This is strange, maybe you can point me to the right direction.
R/W Rights are all the same.
Cheers, Harry.

Btw: depending on the specific variant of the ES 200 that you have there, perhaps ros-industrial/motoman_experimental#28 is interesting.

Hm, actually: what is the output of:
ls -al /home/harry/xs_robot/src/motoman_es200/meshes/collision/es200_saxis_lowres.dae

Comment by Harry XS on 2019-03-06:
Oh, wow. Seems to be OS related, it cant be found:
ls -al /home/harry/xs_robot/src/motoman_es200/meshes/collision/es200_saxis_lowres.dae
ls: Zugriff auf '/home/harry/xs_robot/src/motoman_es200/meshes/collision/es200_saxis_lowres.dae' nicht m√∂glich: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden

Is the path perhaps simply incorrect?
Comment by Harry XS on 2019-03-06:
Nice find, thank you and thank you for the new motoman_experimental es200 link.
Cheers, Harry.

No, its ok and there...
~/xs_robot/src/motoman_es200/meshes/collision$ ls
es200_base_lowres.dae  es200_baxis_lores.dae  es200_laxis_lores.dae  es200_raxis_lores.dae  es200_saxis_lores.dae  es200_taxis_lores.dae  es200_uaxis_lores.dae

I'll close it, since its not ROS related. Thank you very much.

A:

No, its ok and there...

~/xs_robot/src/motoman_es200/meshes/collision$ ls

es200_base_lowres.dae  es200_baxis_lores.dae  es200_laxis_lores.dae  es200_raxis_lores.dae  es200_saxis_lores.dae  es200_taxis_lores.dae  es200_uaxis_lores.dae

I see es200_saxis_lores.dae in this listing, while the URI you spec is:
package://motoman_es200/meshes/visual/es200_saxis_lowres.dae

Note the extra w in lowres vs the lores in the actual filename.

Oh my God, thank you....sometimes we go blind. I need a coffee.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-03-06:
Sometimes :)
Would you be interested in contributing your ES200 model to motoman_experimental?
Comment by Harry XS on 2019-03-09:
I would, but actually the ES200-RDII is exactly the same Robot imo like the ES 165-RDII in this package. It just can carry 200kg instead of165 kg, and it is a bit slower...So yes, I can do it when everything works. Thank you again.
