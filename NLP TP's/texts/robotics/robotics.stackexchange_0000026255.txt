Q:

Simulator_gazebo (1.5) and ROS groovy

I'm trying out simulator_gazebo with groovy.
I noticed that when I tried to add a turtlebot to a test world that there were errors and warnings (see below). But it seems to be working.
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.3">
  <world name="default">
    <physics type="ode">
      <gravity>0 0 0</gravity>
      <ode>
        <solver>
          <type>quick</type>
          <dt>0.001</dt>
          <iters>40</iters>
          <sor>1.0</sor>
        </solver>
        <constraints>

          <contact_surface_layer>0.0</contact_surface_layer>
        </constraints>
      </ode>
    </physics>
    <!-- A global light source -->
    <include>
      <uri>model://sun</uri>

    <!-- A ground plane -->
    <include>
      <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
    </include>
    <include>
      <uri>model://turtlebot</uri>
      <pose>0 0 1 0 0 0</pose>
    </include>
  </world>
</sdf>

Changing the turtlebot to a create, these warnings do not appear. But adding a kinect or a camera to the create also causes 1 queue limit message to be shown.
What else should be tested?

The errors are not critical, just means that certain functions (e.g. ConnectWorldUpdateStart) were deprecated but still kept in for back compatibility.

Hi ! Are you using a URDF model for the Turtlebot or a SDF one ? Is it the Turtlebot 1 or 2 you have ? I am working with groovy and I didn't manage to have the Turtlebot 2 model loaded in Gazebo. Thanks for help.

This is an SDF model downloaded from the database. I think the robot looks like a Turtlebot 1 (but I honestly didn't look too closely, I was more interested in the data coming from the device)
