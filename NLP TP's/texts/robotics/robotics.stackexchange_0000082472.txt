Q:

new to Linux and ROS, Can't install Lunar

I am following the installation instructions on this website
http://wiki.ros.org/lunar/Installation/Ubuntu
but when I try to install the Full Desktop version I get this error.
I don't know what to do.
Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.24-9ubuntu2.2) ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
 hddtemp
 sbcl

E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

thanks

It looks like there was an error while installing packages, but I don't see the actual error in your question. Can you edit your question to include the full error message?

thanks for responding. yes, there were in fact package errors.
So, I basically rebooted my machine and started the whole process over from the beginning and then it worked.
So, I have no idea what caused the problem, but it seems to have fixed itself.
that just sounds wrong..... but it worked

A:

You could try to use one of the available mirrors:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation/UbuntuMirrors
(I have been experiencing - from the EU - several issues with aborted downloads from the main site today, which went away as soon as I switched to a European mirror.)
I hope this helps!
