Q:

ROS 2 Admin Privileges on Windows 10

I'm wondering why Windows 10 needs administrator privileges to build and run ROS 2, and if this could be changed with a patch?

To build ROS 2 you will need a Visual Studio Command Prompt (“x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019”) running as Administrator.

This is detailed in the build settings, but it doesn't link to an explanation of why.

Note that the first time you run any executable you will have to allow access to the network through a Windows Firewall popup.

This, also from the build guide, is my best guess as to why, but I'm asking because I'm not sure.

Is this the explanation you are looking for: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Windows-Development-Setup/#patch-exe-opens-a-new-command-window-and-asks-for-administrator

A:

There is at least one issue: patch.exe seems to require running in administrator mode. There is more context in this rviz_ogre_vendor ticket and a note about it on the Windows development setup page.
