Q:

care-o-bot bad stl files

the care-o-bot stl files inside the cob_description package all start with the word 'solid'. The STL specification says that binary stl files cannot start with solid, this makes a lot of importers (like assimp) fail. We substituted all of them with 'xxxxx' and were able to convert the care-o-bot urdf to collada.

A:

I suggest posting this to the care-o-bot users mailing list as I can't find a place to submit a ticket for them.
