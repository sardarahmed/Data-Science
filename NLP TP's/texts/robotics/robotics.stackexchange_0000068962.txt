Q:

How can I listen to service-topics?

Hey!
When debugging actions, I often do a rostopic echo on the goal and result topic. However, I haven't found similar
topics for services. How can I listen to this communication?

Have you tried rosservice command?

With rosservice you can not get into the communication, you can just call a existing service
rosservice options -> call  find  list  type  uri

Me too, actually when you have something wrong, everything can hang :D

A:

Services are not topics. I guess there is no way to look into it, there is only one service with the same name allowed.
Because services are blocking calls, like function calls.
So to listen to a service, you must provide it, but I guess there is no way to "listen" to it if you are not the call receiver.
