Q:

moveit build error- move_group_interface.h file not found

I am running ROS indigo,I had installed moveit from user binary.When i try to do a catkin_make I get the following error in moveit packages:-
home/<user_name>/catkin_ws/src/moveit_tutorials/doc/pr2_tutorials/pick_place/src/pick_place_tutorial.cpp

fatal_error: moveit/move_group_interface/move_group_interface.h : No such file or directory
#include moveit/move_group_interface/move_group_interface.h
compilation terminated!

I have made no changes to the moveit package.
move_group_interface.h seems to be included in every example code, I dont see how it can be missing.
As a result in the custom package that i have created I am using move_group instead of move_group_interface.

Why does it provide same clone link for both indigo-devel and kinetic-devel branch?. Downloading as zip worked though.

Because you clone a git repository, not a branch. You have to checkout the correct branch yourself.

A:

The moveit_tutorials repository has a separate branch indigo-devel that works on indigo.
You tried to compile the kinetic-devel branch that incorporates changes for MoveIt 0.9.x which is released in ROS kinetic.
