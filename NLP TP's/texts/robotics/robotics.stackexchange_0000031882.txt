Q:

Eclipse debugging in ROS

Hi.
Being from a Windows background, I've found debugging on ROS (Ubuntu 10.10) fairly difficult and not very efficient. I had hoped that Eclipse would allow debugging of nodes launched using ROSLAUNCH, but so far, I have not been successful.
So, my questions:

Has anyone succeeded in debugging a ROS node launched by ROSLAUNCH in Eclipse?

If not using Eclipse or an equivalent IDE, do most of the members of the ROS community depend on the likes of gdb to perform debugging?

Regards, Billy

A:

I've regularly debugged nodes inside of Eclipse. Is there a particular reason you need to launch your node with roslaunch? If you can launch it separately you should be able to create the eclipse project around your package with make eclipse-project, add it, compile it, and then run it in debug mode.

I have been using the same strategy as Augusto with no problems for both nodes and nodelets. There was a recent posting that presented a method to execute a launch file from Eclipse, but I haven't tested it. Tags roslaunch and Eclipse.

Same here: to debug a node I removed it from the launch file, run the launch-file in a separate terminal and then debug my code on eclipse. I agree with you, GDB is certainly not user friendly

In debug mode how can i put breakpoint which make compiler stop in each spin of ros or iteration?
