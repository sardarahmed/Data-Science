Q:

Requiring deep understanding of robot_state_publisher and TF

Hi all,
I have turtlebot2, groovy, turtlebot arm. In reading the tutorial Using urdf with robot_state_publisher, I'm confused in its launch file.
Why there are two "state_publishers" ?
one is "robot_state_publisher", and the other is "state_publisher")
By saying "need a method for specifying what state the robot is in" the tutorial points out the function of "state_publisher",
But in checking robot_state_publisher package we can see the function of robot_state_publisher is "allows you to publish the state of a robot to tf", which seems similar to the function of "state_publisher".
My goal is to broadcaster TF info, so my turtlebot arm can do grasping based on it(which have tf listening function). I have a URDF of turtlebot with arm.
Thanks for your help!

A:

The naming appears to be a bit confusing indeed. There are different representations of a robotÂ´s state. The state_publisher in the tutorial publishes the JointState of the robot, while the robot_state_publisher publishes full 6DOF tf data for all links of the robot, essentially fusing the static information about the robot from the URDF model and the dynamically changing JointState information.
