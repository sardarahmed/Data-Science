Q:

Problem with the Terminal (ROS_DISTRO)

Hello Everyone!!
I have a problem with my Terminal, when I open it get this error:
ROS_DISTRO was set to 'fuerte' before. Please make sure that the environment does not mix paths from different distributions.
And when I have used:
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
Best,
Vincent

A:

This warning just means that some of the ROS environment variables were already set when the /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash file was executed.  The most likely cause of this is an unintentional line in your ~/.bashrc file.  If, for example, your .bashrc "sourced" the setup.bash for Fuerte before the one for Groovy, you would see this error.  Note that the unintentional line could possibly be in other bash startup scripts (such as ~/.profile).
At any time, you can use env |grep ROS to see all of the ROS environment variables.  If none of them are pointing to Fuerte stuff, you are probably fine. Although, you should probably figure out the source of this warning and remove it anyway. Note you can always use the unset command to remove any stray environment variables.
