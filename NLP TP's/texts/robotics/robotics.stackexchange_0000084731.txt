Q:

Move left and right wheel on turtlebot gazebo

Hi guys,
Lately i learnt how to make a turtlebot in gazebo simulator, and moved it by using cmd_vel command.
the question is:

how can i move each wheels because i
should move it by using trajectory
planning?
can we move the turtle bot
to a specific point does cmd_vel
only move the robot "straight" and
"circle"?
if i should make a
"sinusoidal" path using the
trajectory planning, can i use
cmd_vel topic?

Thank you in advance :)

A:

1- using the cmd_vel topic you don't have to worry about moving the wheels individually, that is done for you.
2 - in order to move any robot to a specific point you must first know where it is and which way it is facing. You'll then need to plan a path which the robot must follow to arrive at the final goal point. This is a more complex process than simply issuing a cmd_vel message.
3 - the cmd_vel topic controls the speed and direction a robot should move in at a specific point in time by sending multiple varying cmd_vel messages over time you can make a robot follow a sinusoidal path or any other path for that matter.
Hope this clears some things up for you.

how if i want to move the robot's direction?, i mean i want to control each wheel... for example (rospub -l /my_robot/rightWheel data "1.0")
do u have any reference about how can i move the robot to the specific point?
does cmd vel only make "circle" and "straight" path?
