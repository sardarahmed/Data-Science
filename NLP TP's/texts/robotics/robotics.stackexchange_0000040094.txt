Q:

Bumblebee xb3 and stereo_image_proc

Hello everybody!
I have a question about stereo_image_proc and camera info manager.
I am using the Bumblebee xb3 camera, wich have 3 lenses. I need to get two pairs of images from the camera. One pair with the right and the center lenses (namespace=xb3_short), and another with right and left lenses (namespace=xb3_wide).
In order to run stereo image proc i need this topics:
xb3_short/left/image_raw                                                            
xb3_short/left/camera_info                                                    
xb3_short/right/image_raw                                         
xb3_short/right/camera_info                                                      
                                                                                  
xb3_wide/left/image_raw                                                              
xb3_wide/left/camera_info                                                          
xb3_wide/right/image_raw                                                        
xb3_wide/right/camera_info
                                                                              

But actually xb3_short/right/image_raw and xb3_wide/right/image_raw are the same images. This will result a extra space when i need to record bag files with the camera. Is there a way to record only 3 images instead of 4?

A:

This is probably not relevant, but yes: you can cherry-pick on the topics you want to be recorded in a rosbag.
