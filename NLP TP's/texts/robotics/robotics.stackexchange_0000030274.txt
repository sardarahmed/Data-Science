Q:

rxbag_plugins commandline API

Is it possible to call the rxbag_plugins from commandline? More specific the plot functionality, I'm thinking of the rxplot api but more specific the CSV export function. Are there any plans on this or similar functionality?

A:

The plugins are only for use in rxbag. You could write your own CSV export script for bag files, or just use rostopic. There is a command line option for rostopic that allows echoing a bagfile in a machine-readable format.
