Hi,
The result of the tabletop object segmentation is in TabletopDetectionResult.msg. If you look at this message, you'll see that you get a list of potential models. Each of them has a PoseStamped associated.
So to get the object position, once you've got the result, you can access the poses for each of your detected models:
result.models[i].model_list[j].pose

Hope this helps.

I have tested above instructions, now my problem is that i am just getting the position of the table! i think the objects on the table didn't segmented successfully! Do you know any other segmentation package?
Thanks for your help!
