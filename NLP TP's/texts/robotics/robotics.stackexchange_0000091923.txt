Q:

ROS2 - Does ros1_bridge suppports Indigo

Hi Guys,
I am currently working on a ROS system which has Indigo Distribution. And will be migrating to ROS2 soon.
I would like to know if the ros1_bridge supports ROS1 Indigo distribution.
In the official Github page I could not find details regarding the support to different distribution.
Thank you
KK

A:

Since Indigo targets Ubuntu Trusty and ROS 2 only targets Ubuntu Bionic (or Ubuntu Xenial for older releases) there is no platform overlap between the two. So no, the ros_bridge doesn't support ROS 1 Indigo.
