Q:

problem with objects_of_daily_use_finder!

Hi, I have to use objects_of_daily_use_finder package for recognizing different objects, but i have a problem with output of this package because it does not publish anything in  "found_template" (from the output of the visualization i think the object is recognized!)
anybody faced this problem before?
thanks,

A:

Yes, I spent some days making it work. The current state of that code is not perfect :)
The templates are available, you only have to insert some code to publish them.
If you only need detection and you have a fast CPU then this package might fit your needs after a bit of coding.
What this package can give you:

fast SIFT-based feature matching for
templates (fast: compared to other
implementation)
single detection results ("publishes" matched template)
detection result names (now it's only printed I think but could get the file name of the template as a result)
high false detection rate (based on my experiences)
no pose estimation (important if you are considering grasping)

If you are further interested in this topic we can share experiences in private and create a summary for example on the ros wiki.
