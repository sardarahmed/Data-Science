Q:

how to print ros1 bag data output on ros2

Hi,
How can I print the output of ros1.bag file in ros2…
while I use below command to play data of ros1 in ros2

ros2 bag play -s rosbag_v2 "path-to-ros.bag-file"

I see it is running/playing but i don't see the data which is to be printed on terminal…
while I play the same ros1.bag file in ros1 the output data prints on the terminal… why cant or how can I print this output on the ros2 ??
Kindly answer to my question in a detailed way, as I'am new to this.
Thanks in advance.
Looking forward for the quick reply…

A:

As far as I can tell, ros2 bag play doesn't provide any status console output. Is currently just play the bag file, i.e. reading the data and publishing it to the relevant topics.
There is an open issue about it adding more functionality like the ROS 1 version,: https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/issues/55.
You can comment on it to show your interest in the feature.

Hi @marguedas
Just one clarification, is there any defined way or manual way, where I can convert .bag file into .db3 file??

This is a different question, so it should be asked separately.
You will find similar questions that have been answered in the past e.g. https://answers.ros.org/question/314355/conversion-of-rosbag-file-format-to-rosbag2-file-format/
