Q:

segmentation fault when converting rxbag to csv

Hi ROS fans..
I try to export data from a bagfile using rxbag. After plotting without problems, then I do right click-> export to csv and after naming the file everything crashes with just a seg fault:
Does anybody know why does this happen and how to solve this?
I'm on Ubuntu 11.10 and rxbag crashes both in ROS electric

A:

Not exactly sure why you are getting the segfault. I don't experience this problem on Fuerte.  One potential workaround would be to instead use rostopic to produce your csv file.
rostopic echo -p -b BAG_NAME TOPIC_NAMES > output.csv

will produce a nicely formatted csv file.  I prefer this technique over rxbag because it is easier to automate.  More can be read here.
