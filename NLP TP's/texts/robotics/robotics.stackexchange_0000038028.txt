Q:

Simulated Kinect in gazebo with realistic error model

Has anyone extended the gazebo_ros_openni_kinect plugin to deliver noisy data that is closer to reality than the current "perfect" point clouds the plugin provides? I know that adding this isn't too difficult, but I figured I might just ask if anyone else has already implemented this.

Did you figure out a way to deliver noisy data in Gazebo?

A:

Not for gazebo, but we did a kinect simulator in BlenSor that can export pointclouds in PCD (pointcloud libray data) format
