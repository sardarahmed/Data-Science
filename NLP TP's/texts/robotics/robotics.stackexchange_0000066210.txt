Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: pycharm setup

I am trying to use pycharm as my ide and it doesn't seem to recognize any of the ros libraries(rospy, etc.) even though they are properly installed. If it helps I am using python 3.4.0 and pycharm 4.0.4.

A:

This is probably similar to running an IDE and getting it to code-complete ROS code.
Have you tried starting pycharm from a terminal in which you have sourced your setup.bash?
Otherwise make sure to check your PYTHONPATH, it should contain (at least) /opt/ros/$ros_release/lib/python2.7/dist-packages.

Thanks, adding the PYTHONPATH to the Pycharm Environment Variables fixed the problem

It probably works, but I'd go for the "sourced environment" option. If anything ever changes in ROS wrt Python setup/paths, you don't have to do anything. Setting the PYTHONPATH (or adding it to pycharm's setup) would mean you'd have to track any changes in ROS manually.
