Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Bent robot

Another way to put the question: what makes the robot stand? and what makes it bent? I cannot attach a picture since my karma is below 60 but I hope that my question is clear.
Thanks
I have two identical environments running exactly the same drcsim (1.0.3): one where the robot stands and one where the robot is bent. (See attached picture)
I don't know what makes the robot be bent. Can you help me?
I lost my eyesight trying to find the difference between the two environments without success.
Thanks for enlightening me.

what launch file did you use to start the worlds?

A:

I suspect that the difference is due to exactly when the position-holding controllers were engaged with respect to when simulation started.  To avoid this kind of difference, later versions of drcsim use a 10-second (simulated) delay before applying gravity to the Atlas model.
