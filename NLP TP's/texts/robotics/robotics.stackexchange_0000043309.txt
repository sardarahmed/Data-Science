Q:

Spawning Problems with Fuerte Ubuntu 12.04

so I see there has been issues with spawning urdf or models in Gazebo here
so using,
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -gazebo -file rospack find gazebo_worlds/objects/coffee_cup.model -model coffee_cup -x 1.2 -z 1
just doesn't spawn anything... it just adds it in the models list.
Is this happening for most people? or is it an issue that can be fixed somehow?
Is there perhaps a different way to spawn objects in gazebo for Fuerte?

you set your node name on startup of the launch file correct?  If so that is already set to
<node name="gazebo" pkg="gazebo" type="gazebo" args="$(find r2_gazebo)/gazebo/r2_empty.world" output="screen"  /

I figured out you can spawn .xacro files.  I was able to get simple_sphere.urdf files to spawn if you change the extension to simple_sphere.xacro.

A:

There were some bugs in the spawn_model script, waiting for services in the wrong namespace.  This should be fixed by the next release 1.6.13.
For now, things should work if you change your gazebo node name to gazebo, e.g.:
<node name="gazebo" pkg="gazebo" type="gazebo" args="..."/>
