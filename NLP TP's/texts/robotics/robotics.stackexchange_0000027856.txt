Q:

How can I turn off the Space Navigator's control of the camera?

I'm using a plugin to control models with the Space Navigator (spacenav 6 DOF) 3D mouse. It works, but the controller is controlling both the object (through the spnav external library) and the camera at the same time. I'm looking for a way to turn off the camera control and just use the regular mouse for that. If necessary, it looks like i could recompile Gazebo from source after commenting out the relevant lines in gazebo/gui/CMakeLists.txt, but it would be easier to use ~/.gazebo/gui.ini, or an API call, or something.

A:

There is a much easier way: Just adapt the configuration in ~/.gazebo/gui.ini
[spacenav]
deadband_x = 0.1
deadband_y = 0.1
deadband_z = 0.1
deadband_rx = 0.1
deadband_ry = 0.1
deadband_rz = 0.1
topic=~/spacenav/remapped_joy_topic_to_something_not_used

Just change the topic to something you are going to listen in your own plugin and it will not interfere with the gui, which listens to ~/spacenav/joy
Best regards!
