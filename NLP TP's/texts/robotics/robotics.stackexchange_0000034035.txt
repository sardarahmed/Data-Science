Q:

rxgraph giving index out of range when turtlebot node starts

I am trying to get a graph of what is running on my turtlebot but when I start rxgraph after the turtlebot_bringup.launch it stops and says there is an index out of range error.  Here is the output from the terminal where I ran rxgraph:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/rx/rxgraph/src/rxgraph/impl.py", line 123, in run
    changed = g.update()
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/tools/rosgraph/src/rosgraph/impl/graph.py", line 568, in update
        updated = self._node_refresh(next) or updated
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/tools/rosgraph/src/rosgraph/impl/graph.py", line 452, in _node_refresh
    updated = self._node_refresh_businfo(node, api, bad_node)
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/ros_comm/tools/rosgraph/src/rosgraph/impl/graph.py", line 407, in _node_refresh_businfo
    connection_id = info[0]
IndexError: list index out of range

As a final note, rxgraph runs fine with other applications but with the turtlebot_bringup.launch it produces the above.
Any ideas?

A:

This is a known bug in rxgraph ticketed here: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3579
you can use rosnode list to see the list of node running on your TurtleBot

Is there any idea on release date for 1.4.8?  Thanks for the quick response as well.
