Please tell us what you've tried yourself already.
We're here to help, but not to write your code for you.
Susbcribers and publishers are language agnostic. It doesn't matter whether you "publish in Python" or "subscribe in C++". The data will arrive.

A:

First place to start would be: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/ros_tutorials/kinetic-devel/roscpp_tutorials/listener/listener.cpp (from ROS Wiki Tutorial). The callback is where you will handle the parsing of the message and subsequent storing into your array I think.
