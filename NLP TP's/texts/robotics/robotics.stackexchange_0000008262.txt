Q:

Real-time video processing on video feed from a drone's camera

I am working on a project where I want to run some computer vision algorithms (e.g. face recognition) on the live video stream coming from a flying drone. 
There are many commercial drones out there that offer video streams, like

https://www.lily.camera/
etc..

But none of them seem to give access to the video feed for real-time processing. 
Another idea is to have the drone carry a smartphone, and do the processing on the phone through the phone's camera. Or just use a digital camera and an arduino that are attached to the drone. 
Although these ideas are feasible, I would rather access the video-feed of the drone itself. So my question is that are there any drones out there that offer this feature? or can be hacked somehow to achieve this? 

A:

This  AR.Drone provides SDK, therefore, you can access the images on real-time. It is fully compatible with Linux. They have examples also for smartphones. I believe android and iPhone. It has two cameras. I've bought it and its price is reasonable. At that time, the price was roughly 272 CAD. Of course, the price is now more expensive than before but I believe it is affordable. You need to know c programming and Makefiles. 

A:

I bought an AR done 2.0 for my research.
I used Labview to process the realtime video feed from either the bottom camera of the drone or the front camera.
You can read more details on how to setup the 3rd party free library to use Labview to control and to receive realtime sensors data and video feed as well:
