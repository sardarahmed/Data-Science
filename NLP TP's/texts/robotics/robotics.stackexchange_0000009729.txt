Q:

Difference between Degrees of Freedom (DOF) and Degrees of Motion (DOM)

What is a difference between degrees of freedom (DOF) and degrees of motion (DOM)? I know that DOF is the number of independent movements a manipulation arm can make and robot system can have max 6 independent DOF and unlimited number of DOM but I do not distinguish them from each other.

A:

The way you are describing it, DOM is the number of independent dimensions in $\vec q$.   DOF is the number of independent dimensions in $\vec x$.  In practice, a robotics engineer will use DOF to represent the number of independent actuators of the robot, which you are calling DOM.   Better notation would be to call DOM the mobility of the system, as described in the Mobility formula section here.
Using your notation:
Think of a telescoping pole made out of 5 sections that can collapse inside each other.   The degree of freedom is the length of the pole.  That value can be anything between its fully-collapsed length, up to its fully-extended length.  DOF = 1.
If there is a sliding joint between each section of the pole, there will be four independent motions you can use to set the total length.  DOM = 4. 
In kinematics, the length would typically be denoted by $x$, and the individual joint lengths would be assigned values of $q_1$ through $q_4$.   
$\vec x = f(\vec q)$
