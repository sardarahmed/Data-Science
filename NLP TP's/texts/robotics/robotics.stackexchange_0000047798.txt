Q:

How to visualize articulation with fuerte

I'm trying out the nice articulation package.
However, the articulation_rviz_plugin does not exist anymore and most of the tutorials require the plugin. Having said that it's always useful to have a visualization. The manifest files state:
<!-- does not work in fuerte
<depend package="articulation_rviz_plugin"/>
-->

So, is there a way to visualize the results of the articulation package anyway, and if not, what is the best way to create a visualization by hand?

I spoke to one of the developers. Currently there is no visualization in fuerte.
