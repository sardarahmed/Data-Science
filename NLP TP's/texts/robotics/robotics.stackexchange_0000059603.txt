Q:

fails gazebo to start from ROS (boost::exception_detail error)

Hi.
I am working on ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTE Thrusty (OK, I know it is not yet released).
When I try to start Gazebo, it fails most of the time (1 time in 10, it works). I use the simple command:
$ roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

Here are the messages:
$ roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

This one fails either:
roscore & rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

The only way I found to make it work is to start one by one, roscore, gzserver and gzclient.
Does it come from the unstable state of ROS Indigo? Any idea how to fix this?
Thanks.

Any ideas are welcome. Do you think that it could come from my hardware? (LENOVO T400)

I have found the same issue on the Gazebo forum: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/6271/getting-remote-endpoint-failed-let-gazebo-gui/

I experience same issue, running ROS Hydro, Ubuntu 12.04. roscore & rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo does not work, produces the following error: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc' what(): std::bad_alloc
Yet, I am able to start gazebo using roscore, gzserver, and gzclient.
