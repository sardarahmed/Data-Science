Q:

How to build a 3D view with RealSense R200

Hi to all,
I've installed everything included in https://github.com/PercATI/RealSense_ROS and I'm able to launch
roslaunch realsense realsense_r200_launch.launch

without problems or errors.
Since I would like to use my Realsense R200 to build a 3D view of my environment in RVIZ, I tried to load the realsenseRvizConfiguration.rviz configuration file as the author suggests in his tutorial.
When I load this file, I get this error: " Fixed Frame [world] does not exist " and " For frame [camera_depth_optical_frame]: Fixed Frame [world] does not exist" as you can see in the attached screenshot.

This is my view_frames output: view_frames.png.
I noticed that there is no world frame, but I don't know how to load it in my tf tree.
I would like to build a 3D view like it is shown in http://wiki.ros.org/RealSense_R200?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=snapshot.png.
In addition, do you think it's possible to move the sensor around a room and build a 3D map?
Thank you for your time,
Rocco Galati

I modified my question since now I'm able to correctly run the sensor node, but I'm still not able to build a 3D view in RVIZ. Please help me..

A:

The fixed frame relative to which all data is shown in rviz is set to world, but your realsense camera frames do not have a tf connection to that frame, so data cannot be displayed correctly. If you enter realsense_frame as fixed frame in rviz, you should see sensor data.
You can probably build a 3D map using the Realsense, but this generally is not trivial. There are multiple packages that probably can be set up to work with the R200, such as RGBD-SLAM, RTABMAP (for that see this Q/A), viso2 and others. All of them require some setup effort however.

Yes, if I specify realsese_frame as fixed frame I can see some data coming from the sensor, but they dont create a 3D view since they change while I move the camera sensor. So, if I want to have a 3D view or map, should I use RTABMAP? It works also with the realsense or only with Kinect?

Looks like it should work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc1WhmFCjcc

I watched the same video before and I'm trying to figure out how to do this. Unfortunately, there is no so much literature on this topic :( If I will have problems, can you help me, please? Are you confident with this theme?

I don't have time to give detailed assistance. You might want to check out the rtabmap forum however. See for instance http://official-rtab-map-forum.206.s1.nabble.com/ROS-2D-occupancy-grid-td1204.html
