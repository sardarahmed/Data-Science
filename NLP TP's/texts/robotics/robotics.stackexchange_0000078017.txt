Q:

Error "FindEigen3.cmake" during install kinetic on RPi

hi all
first: marry  christmas
second : I'm not skilled about install a so large enviroment|software ... so I followed the wiki : install Kinect on raspberry
http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing ROS Kinetic on the Raspberry Pi
and at point 3.3 Building the catkin Workspace I have got this error
    ==> Processing catkin package: 'geometric_shapes' 
==> Creating build directory: 'build_isolated/geometric_shapes' 
==> Building with env: '/opt/ros/kinetic/env.sh' 
==> cmake /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/geometric_shapes -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/geometric_shapes -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/op
t/ros/kinetic -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Unix Makefiles in '/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/geometric_shapes'

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package): 
 By not providing "FindEigen3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has 
 asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3", but 
 CMake did not find one. 

 Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3" with any 
 of the following names: 

   Eigen3Config.cmake 
   eigen3-config.cmake

I've read many posts, but it is unclear for me which  cmakelist.txt edit and how to fix it.

Did you fix this as I have the same issue
Comment by AleAle99 on 2017-01-07:
burf2000 Sorry, still no solution ....
and unfortunately no idea  about what to do!

A:

So my workaround for this was to find anywhere where find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED) is included in CMakeList.txt in the src directory (In each package)
and replace with
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR})
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
include_directories(${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR})

Second, Find a copy of the FindEigen3.cmake file and copy it to the same place as the CMakeList.txt.  I found it in another package.

GREAT!
and to find the string in each CMakeList.txt   can I use a linux command or you did it manually?
are many files to be changed?
thanks!
Ale

something like this is right ???
grep -r -i "find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)" /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/

Comment by AleAle99 on 2017-01-07:
i modified 2 files:
~/ros_catkin_ws $ grep -r -i "find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)" ~/ros_catkin_ws/

~/ros_catkin_ws/src/robot_state_publisher/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
~/ros_catkin_ws/src/geometric_shapes/CMakeLists.txt:find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
but  same error!!!

updated dude :)

hI BURF2000
I copied the file FindEigen3.cmake near the two CMakeLists.txt previously modified in the packages
~/ros_catkin_ws/src/robot_state_publisher/
~/ros_catkin_ws/src/geometric_shapes/
but the error is the same.

Followed the instructions verbatim (for desktop install not ROS-comm) and have the same issue.
This answer fixed my issue. Thanks fo that. Here is a slightly quicker grep command.
~/ros_catkin_ws $ grep -ri "find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)" . --include '*CMakeLists.txt'
