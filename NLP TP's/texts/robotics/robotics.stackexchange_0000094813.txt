Q:

Groot: how finds models? how connects to running BT?

Hi! 'm trying to use Groot to first visualize, then modify ROS2 navigation BT. I use eloquent on 18.04, all compiled from sources (Groot,  BehaviorTree.CPP and ROS2 navigation)
When I try to open a tree, e.g. navigate_w_replanning.xml, I get this error:

But I have no idea how to tell Groot where to find models, nor can find any documentation.
And the second question, I tried to visualize the running nav2 BT (a BehaviorTree.CPP), but nothing seems to publish to port 1666:

How I enable this feature on BehaviorTree.CPP?  Again, cannot find any parameter nor documentation.
Thanks!

This is a great question for @Carl D.
Frankly, Iâ€™ve always designed the BTs on paper and edited by hand. But I think in the software crowd that makes me a heretic.

Digging this out, I also encounter the second error, even though I'm using ROS1 (Kinetic). I'm not sure which port I should use since default (1666) doesn't work, or if I should configure it somewhere in the xml. I couldn't find anything related to real-time monitoring in the doc.
EDIT : found my answer here, in the loggers example code : https://www.behaviortree.dev/tutorial_05_subtrees/

A:

Unfortunately, development work needs to be done to enable both your questions.
For the first question, about the unregistered model. Nav 2 uses some custom control nodes. I believe there is no way to add custom control nodes to Groot at the moment. @Davide Faconti can probably confirm this or provide a solution.
For the second question, either Groot needs to be ported to ROS2, or we need to add the ZeroMQ publisher to the navigation 2 behavior tree. I would personally rather see Groot ported to ROS2, because I believe it would be beneficial to be able to capture the behavior tree messages in a Rosbag.

Thanks for the answer. Looking forward to Davide's  comments (and also to a ROS2 porting, it would be great!)
