Q:

I can`t visualize a output from a PointCloud2 topic on RVIZ

I tried with a lot of codes, but, when I try to see the output topic from PointCloud2 on rviz it doesn't show any point cloud at all, I think there is a problem with the configuration of my RVIZ, but, I don`t know what it is, I tried to reinstall it and do the same steps again, but, it didn't work, could you guys help me?

It started to work, but, I don't know why, it started to show the outputs, if you ever get into this situation, try to do step by step, even the configuration of rviz, there must be something missing, so check it.

A:

Did you try rostopic list on a new terminal to check if the topic is actually being published?

It was publishing, I don't know what happened, but, rviz started to show the output, thanks for remembering that, I'll keep checking future codes if it is publishing.
