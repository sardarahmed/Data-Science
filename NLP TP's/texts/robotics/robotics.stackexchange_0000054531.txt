Q:

How to create subscriber in a publisher

I want to create a node that will publish a topic but before that subscribes to listen to another topic.  I want to rostopic pub /my_topic_cg std_gs/String "GO" ,and when the listener gets the "GO" published another topic which would print "The race has started" for example.  How can i manage this? ive looked into it in the tutorial but could not get a answer.  Also can i publish a number instead of a string, how can I do it in cpp?

A:

Yes you can do that.  I suggest you go through all the ROS Tutorials. (This one will help you, but you should go through all of them before as they are cumulative.)
