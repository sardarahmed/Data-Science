Q:

Wireless RGB-D Image Streaming experience lagging

Greetings. I already optimized the wireless image streaming.
The frames are being transmitted by 10fps @ 320x240 resolution. Depth is compressed in PNG while Color is compressed in JPG. I measured their bandwidth by using rostopic bw and I get 450+ kB/s.
There was no lag and it was smooth sailing but suddenly, after few more testing, it began lagging and soon stopped sending images.
Though RGB still send, the depth stopped.
What could possibly be the problem? Is it the Wi-Fi router? Is it the image transport encapsulation? Or is it the driver?
