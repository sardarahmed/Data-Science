Q:

ros_arduino_bridge fighting me every step of the way, Raspberry Pi, Hydro, Wheezy

I've been trying to avoid asking what I'm hoping has an obvious answer, but after 30 hours of struggling with this, it's time to ask the experts.
I've installed ROS (Hydro) on an Raspberry PI.  It seems to have gone as well as could be expected.  I can start roscore, etc.
I've already modified the arduino firmware to do what I wanted (simple encoder, different h-bridge) and it seems to be working from the serial monitor.
However, when I try to launch ros_arduino_bridge, I get the following:
ERROR:  cannot launch node of type [ros_arduino_python/arduino_node.py]: can't locate node [arduino_node.py] in package [ros_arduino_python]

I'm a total ros and python newb, and linux is not far behind.  I know enough to be dangerous.
ROS lives (I think) in the directory ~/ros_catkin_ws.
Google isn't helping.  I've been through fuerte from an image for the pi, groovy from an image, indigo from repository, and now hydro from repository.
Help?
Thanks,
Ed

A:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ros_arduino_python/arduino_node.py]: can't locate node [arduino_node.py] in package [ros_arduino_python]

I'm by no means an RPI wizard, but have you made sure you've got the ros_arduino_python package installed on your RPI? If so, check that it has the arduino_node.py Python script in there somewhere. That is basically what the error is telling you: it cannot find the requested executable (in this case a Python script) in the package specified (in this case ros_arduino_python).
Finally, make sure you've sourced the appropriate setup.bash. If you have the ros_arduino_bridge packages in ~/catkin_ws, then you should, after catkin_make-ing, source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash. If you fail to do this, ROS won't be able to find the packages in your catkin workspace.
If you installed ros_arduino_bridge using Debians, then sourcing the normal setup.bash in /opt/ros/DISTRO/ should work for you.

That moved me along a step -- thanks!  Up next:  Figuring out why this install seems to have skipped so many things...
Off to experiment!

Nice. Please use comments next time for these things: answers are really just for answers to the question. I've changed your's into a comment.
