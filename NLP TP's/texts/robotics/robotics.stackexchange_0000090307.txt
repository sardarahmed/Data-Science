Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Mapping robot

Hi
What is needed to make a keyboard - driven robot (w - a - s - d) with 2 motors + encoders, which is capable of creating maps with 360 laser scans (RPLIDAR)? Should the robot Subscribe msg / cmd_vel and publish msg / odom, msg / laser_scan to RVIZ? anything else?
Thanks

You've come to the right place. This tutorial will do everything you're asking. Take your time and work through it slowly. That will be much faster than trying to skim it and take short cuts.
