Q:

odom frame, robot base link frame and local cost map are not in the same plane

I followed the ros navigation tutorial from omniverse isaac sim, and discovered that the odom, local costmap and robot base link are not in the same plane.
(I wanted to upload the screenshot of the rviz result and tf tree, but I lack of points..)
Sorry if this is the basic question and thanks for your advices in advance.

Thank you for your reply. I wanted to upload the screenshot but I needed more points to upload some image files.. By the way, I solved the problem. The issue was related to the initial pose of the robot, which was different to the position values in the launch file.
