Q:

Line following in ROS

Hi!
I was just wondering if there is any demo/tutorial on line following for ROS.
I have a Turtlebot and I would like to mount a webcam on it and let it follow a line.
I found some line following algorithm for the Eddiebot, which is somewhat similar to Turtlebot. I am trying to make it work with the Turtlebot. Any hints and help are welcomed.
Being a rookie in ROS I don't know how to make this work in ROS and Turtlebot. Can anyone please help me here?

Maybe.. need to extract the line from image. If u have a camera model, u are able to get the relative coordinates of the line respect to your robot. feed it into global planner... Or u do not have a camera model, you can build a PID controller, make sure the line is perpendicular in the near end..

A:

I found another solution for Turtlebot with line tracking and collision detection. Here you can see a video in action: video and the code can be downloaded from here:
However, this was written for the original Turtlebot, and I
if you want to use it on Turtlebot 2 it needs the following adjustments: the program sends the move commands to a false topic, thus it needs to be changed to the right one: /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop at line 5 in Movement.cpp.

I want to build a similar project but i don't have a turtlebot. I will build a robot platform on my own. Can you pls tell me what are all the hardware does this project(package) utilizes. so that i will build a custom robot including the required hardware.
