Q:

Localization vs Navigation

I am learning ROS for my first time, and I am confused about the difference between localization and navigation.  As I understand it, amcl is the package used for localization, but then the navigation stack is a separate package.  I am having a hard time seeing the difference between the two, because it seems the nav_stack is performing localization tasks; I do not see the need for localization.  Is it possible to run a robot only using the nav_stack with sensors and actuators; without using any sort of localization?

A:

Broadly speaking, Navigation Stack of ROS involves the folllowings

Localization
Collision Avoidance
Trajectory Planning

Localization involves one question: Where is the robot now?  or where am I, keeping in mind that "here" is relative to some landmark.

And then navigation is how do I get somewhere else (preferably without hitting things along the way).
Comment by cagatay on 2016-07-21:
also exploring and mapping the enviroment that robot is operating

I guess this could be subjective, but I'm not sure navigation includes all that. I can navigate quite well without making a map at the same time, provided I already have one, which is certainly possible.

I am referring to nav_stack of ros
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-07-21:
Ah ok, I understood your comment to be about the concept of navigation in general.
Comment by cagatay on 2016-07-21:
I edited my response regarding to ROS, yeah it may be subjective but generally speaking, the navigation concept can be extended to involve mapping and exploration
Comment by Raisintoe on 2016-07-22:
Cagatay, thank you for the response.  So when talking about navigation, there are a number of packages I need to consider.  What are they? Or what are the main parts that make up navigation?  So far I have been reading about amcl for mapping, and the nav_stack.  Also tf is helpful.
