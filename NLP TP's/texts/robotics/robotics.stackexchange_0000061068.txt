Q:

subscribe to 4 different topics with 2 asus xtions callback error

Hello everyone,
I have 2 asus xtions and want to subscribe to both of the depth and rgb topics.
But the callback of all 4 topics in my program never gets called. The problem only occurs when I subscribe to 4 different topics. Subscribing let's say twice the same depth topic works fine. I checked the topics in rviz and they are all correct.
This is the code where I register the callback
message_filters::Subscriber<sensor_msgs::Image> depthSub1(nh, "/camera1/depth/image", 1);
message_filters::Subscriber<sensor_msgs::Image> colorSub1(nh, "/camera1/rgb/image_color", 1);
message_filters::Subscriber<sensor_msgs::Image> depthSub2(nh, "/camera2/depth/image", 1);
message_filters::Subscriber<sensor_msgs::Image> colorSub2(nh, "/camera2/rgb/image_color", 1);
message_filters::Synchronizer<SyncPolicy> sync(SyncPolicy(10), depthSub1, colorSub1,depthSub2, colorSub2);

sync.registerCallback(boost::bind(&PointCloudCalibration::callbackCombi, this, _1, _2, _3, _4));

SyncPolicy is defined as:
typedef message_filters::sync_policies::ApproximateTime<sensor_msgs::Image, sensor_msgs::Image,sensor_msgs::Image, sensor_msgs::Image > SyncPolicy;

When I change depthSub2 "/camera2/depth/image" to "/camera1/depth/image" it works.
It appears to me like if it would not be possible to subscribe to 4 different topics.
How can I fix that and what might be the reason?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Finally I know what the problem was, thanks for your help, because it made me realize that the frequency was too low. I used 2 USB 2.0 interfaces because the xtion didn't work with USB 3.0. But for USB 2.0 the bandwidth was too high, so I updated the cameras firmware and now they work with USB 3.0 and my problems are gone :)
