Please link to any instructions you are following.

the instructions is from mavros installation guide in github :
https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/indigo-devel/mavros/README.md

A:

Binary builds of Indigo are not available on Debian Jessie. http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html#indigo-igloo-may-2014
Debian Jessie builds are available for Kinetic by only on amd64 and armv8 which I believe does not overlap with the pi zero either. https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config/tree/production/kinetic
So you'll likely need to build what you need from source.

As stated above, ROS doesn't have binary packages supporting the pi zero rn, so if you want to build mavros, you would have to build everything from source, http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Source
