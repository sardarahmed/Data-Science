Q:

Translation between optical and base-frame

Update: rephrase of question:
Why will a static transform not work on a data stream where the relation is fixed. Like base-link to optical-camera frame bringing ZYX into XYZ alignment.
Attempting to avoid programming translations. Would like to translate the optical frame to my base-link. When I do this as a static transform I get a funny results. See video.
 <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="link6_broadcaster" 
                 args="0 0 0 0 0 -1.57  base_link camera_frame 10" />

Video of the result

inverting the child and parent cause a loop error. There should not be a second broadcaster. I am using the kinetics plugin in gazebo. Though I had not done a ros graph so I will do that now. ....AH...you are correct I was transforming twice in another static transformer.

A:

As Thomas points out in comment. I was transforming twice in another static transformer.
