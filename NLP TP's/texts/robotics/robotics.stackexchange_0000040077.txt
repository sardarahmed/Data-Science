Q:

raytracing for occupancy grid map

Hello: Can someone help me to get the ray-tracing code for occupancy grid map. I know its somewhere sitting may be in costmap or gmapping or a standalone node but I want to know exactly.
I am looking for something like:
void raycasting_occupancygridmap(robot pose, &range image);

This function should take the robot pose as input and return range image as output.
this function have the following information:
1. current grid map
2. sensor parameters (FOV, resolution and may be max range if needed)

looking forward for help.
Thanks in advance
Daniel

This looks an awful lot like you're asking us to do your homework for you.

A:

Have a look at the costmap_2d package if you'd like some help. The "costmap_2d.cpp" source file contains most of the raytracing source code used in populating the costmaps with observation data from laser scans and point clouds.
Your problem is very large, and is not something that we can directly help you with. Take a look at costmap_2d, and if you have any specific questions, feel free to ask for help with them, but this question is extremely broad for us to help you.

It's been too long since this answer, but I am also looking for something similar. The implementation of raytraceLine in costmap_2d.h (for Noetic) accepts starting x, y coordinates and ending x, y coordinates. The point of ray tracing as I understand is to find a range that would eventually give me the ending x, y coordinates (or vice versa). Thoughts?
