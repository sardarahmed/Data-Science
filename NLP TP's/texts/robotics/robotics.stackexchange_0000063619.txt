Q:

Install newer version of octomap on Groovy?

Hi all,
I am currently on Groovy and cannot upgrade due to limitations of our group. However, I would like to get a newer version of Octomap package on Groovy, how would I do that?
The package website states "This means that you compile against OctoMap without requiring any ROS-specific build tools or catkin macros (in fact, they won't work)." What does this mean?

A:

It means that octomap is a standalone package (i.e. ROS agnostic). You can include that in your project as any other cmake package.
