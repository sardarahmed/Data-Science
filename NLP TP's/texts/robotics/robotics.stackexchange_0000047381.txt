Q:

fake_localization tutorial not working in Groovy

I think either PR2 simulator tutorial is wrong or fake_localization is broken
Link
I bring up PR2 with
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_emptyworld.launch

I verify pr2 controller is up by
roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_keyboard.launch

And then try to run fake_localization
rosrun fake_localization fake_localization

but it gives
[WARN] [1358454895.474588813, 112.908000000]: Message from [unknown] has a non-fully-qualified frame_id [odom]. Resolved locally to [/odom].  This is will likely not work in multi-robot systems.  This message will only print once.
