Q:

Create2 incremental encoder rollover method

I have never yet had the Create2's incremental encoder rollover but want to write my code to be prepared for this to happen and test it. When the encoder rolls past 32767 (14.5m), does it rollover to -32768 and count there or start at 0 again and count up from there?
One other odd thing but not a big deal. When I reset the Create2, the first value is 1 not 0. 

A:

With a 16-bit two's-compliment counter, the highest positive number would be 32,767, while the lowest negative number is -32,768. So it would overflow from 32,767 to -32,768. When counting in the opposite direction, it would underflow from -32,768 to 32,767.
