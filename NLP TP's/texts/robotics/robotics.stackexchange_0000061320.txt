Q:

escape behavior change

hi, all,
on my robot, the escape behaviour in move_base navigation stack is too 'fierce'.
the rotation is much too fast.
how can I change it?

Or, is there a way to inhibit the rotatory recovery behaviour?

A:

The parameters for configuring the recovery behaviors are listed here: http://wiki.ros.org/rotate_recovery#TrajectoryPlannerROS_Parameters
You can remove the recovery behaviors by configuring the recovery_behaviors parameter. http://wiki.ros.org/move_base#Parameters

thanks David,
are they both set in base_local_planner_params.yaml? under "TrajectoryPlannerROS"

Probably. I don't know what your exact configuration is, but you can set them there. If you want them to be different than your normal path planning parameters, you have to set them somewhere else under the rotate_recovery namespace.
