Q:

rqt_plot issues in indigo

I have a ros node which publishes a custom message as well as sensor_msgs/JointState messages. Both show up correctly in rostopic echo but not in rqt_plot.
When starting up rqt_plot I see an error: could not get message class for topic type "MyCustomMsg" on topic "my_topic". The message does not show up in rqt_plot's dropdown menu, and can't be added if I type it in explicitly. The message is a float64[] array and should be accessible as my_topic/my_message_data[0] but this doesn't work. The problem is similar to this thread: http://answers.ros.org/question/72739/cant-plot-some-messages-types-on-rqt_plot/ except that restarting doesn't solve it.
The second problem is with the JointState message and similar to https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/261 so the question is if this is fixed in the next indigo release?

A:

(1) Are you sure you have your custom workspace sourced properly when you started rqt_plot?
You should be able to close rqt_plot, and, in the same terminal, run rosmsg show MyCustomMsg to confirm that your workspace was set up properly.
(2) The second issue you linked to should be resolved in the next releases of rqt_plot and ros_comm. In the meantime, you should use both packages from source as recommended in the ticket.

It is entirely possible that the first issue was caused by not having the workspace sourced properly, because the problem is gone - but I can make it appear by skipping the sourcing step.
The second issue I can live with for now until the next update. Interestingly enough an array works fine if it's defined as fixed size, so my custom message with a 6 element array works, but not JointState.
Thanks!

According to the latest update on the ticket you linked to, the patches to rqt_plot are released and should be available for installation.
