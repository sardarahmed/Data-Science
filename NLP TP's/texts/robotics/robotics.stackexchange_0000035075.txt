Q:

Rviz errors out with an "X Window System error"

When I run the command
$ rosrun rviz rviz 

It fails with:
The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadLength (poly request too large or internal Xlib length erro'.
(Details: serial 17 error_code 16 request_code 153 minor_code 17)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

It seemed to happen out of nowhere. It was working before.
