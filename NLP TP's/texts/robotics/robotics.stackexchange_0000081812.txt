Q:

How compile a ROS package if previously I compiled ROS Cartographer

I am testing Cartographer in a ROS Kinect installation.
In my catkin_ws I have installed ROS Cartographer following the notes from the documentation:
https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
and I tested some demos so the installation run nice.
Later, I have created a new package but when I try to compile:
-- ~~  traversing 6 packages in topological order:
-- ~~  - ceres-solver (plain cmake)
-- ~~  - cartographer (plain cmake)
-- ~~  - cartographer_ros_msgs
-- ~~  - cartographer_ros
-- ~~  - cartographer_new <- NEW ROS PACKAGE
-- ~~  - cartographer_rviz

I receive the following error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_workspace.cmake:95 (message):
  This workspace contains non-catkin packages in it, and catkin cannot build
  a non-homogeneous workspace without isolation.  Try the
  'catkin_make_isolated' command instead.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:63 (catkin_workspace)

I tried with catkin_make and catkin_make_isolated but I can´t solve the problem.
I think that it is a error from a beginner.
Many thanks in advance.

A:

You should look into using catkin_tools instead of catkin_make. catkin_tools is a more user-friendly wrapper around catkin. It handles package isolation better than catkin_make, and it has some nice features like being able to build packages individually. It's still technically in beta, but there are several businesses and organizations using it in production.

Many thanks it works nice.
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
