Q:

collada-dom2.4-sp-dev causes dist-upgrade to fail on ubuntu 14.04

We need to do a dist-upgrade this morning and ran into a problem with the machines that have ros installed on them.  I had to comment out the ros apt file and remove several ros packages to get ubuntu updates to install.  After that I went back and tried to reinstall ros-indigo-desktop-full. The new collada-dom2.4-sp-dev gives the following error:
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  collada-dom-dev collada-dom2.4-sp-dev ros-indigo-collada-parser
  ros-indigo-collada-urdf ros-indigo-desktop ros-indigo-desktop-full
  ros-indigo-robot ros-indigo-robot-model ros-indigo-simulators

Unpacking collada-dom2.4-sp-dev (2.4.4.1-ubuntu1~trusty1) ...  dpkg:
error processing archive

Are you using the shadow-fixed repository?

A:

Problems of this kind are common with the ROS repository. It is so easy to specify a conflict in the .deb config file!
Try:
 sudo dpkg --purge --force-all collada-dom2.4-dp-dev 

and than you can
 sudo apt-get install -f

It's also easy to declare this in your package.xml using the conflict and replace tags. I'd report this to the package maintainer, as it's clearly unintended.

I tried that right after I posted the question and it worked.  Thanks for the reply.

I added a comment to robot_model/issues/118.

And tracked at collada-dom/issues/20. Should already be fixed in-source, not sure when new pkgs will be imported.
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2015-12-23:
The changes are still not in the repository. But thank you very much for reporting, gvdhoorn.

Syncing will take a while. I wouldn't have expected them to be available already.
