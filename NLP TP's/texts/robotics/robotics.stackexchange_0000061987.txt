Q:

how to run base_local_planner and dwa_local_planner standalone?

hi, all,
I am trying to run the navigational core move_base separately.
there are number of nodes to run before it functions properly.
among them, I cannot find any executable under base_local_planner and dwa_local_planner packages, i.e. I cannot 'rosrun xx_local_planner [executable]'.
how to run them as standalone nodes?
thanks
ray

A:

move_base is one node that loads planners using pluginlib. Planner classes follow the interfaces defined in base_local_planner and base_global_planner, but they don't (usually) directly publish or subscribe to anything.
If you REALLY want to run a planner on it's own, you can write a small c++ node that loads the plugin as a member variable, and sets up the publishers/subscriptions as necessary.
