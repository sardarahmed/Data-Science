Wild guess: the page is created automatically from your package.xml and there is no author-tag but just a maintainer-tag?

A:

Looking at the source here: https://github.com/DinnerHowe/rplidar_python/blob/master/package.xml
It looks like you never filled out the author tag in your package.xml file. Just add something like the following line in there:
<author>DinnerHowe</author>
