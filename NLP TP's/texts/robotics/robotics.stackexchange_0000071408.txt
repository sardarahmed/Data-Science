Q:

Install Indigo on ubuntu 15.04 [vivid]

I am trying to install ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 15.04 from source.
After trying to install dependencies in the catkin workspace I'm getting the following error message:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:
gazebo_ros: No definition of [gazebo] for OS version [vivid]
gazebo_plugins: No definition of [gazebo] for OS version [vivid]

I have tried working through the answer in this previously asked question. But, unfortunately the same error message persists when trying to install dependencies.
