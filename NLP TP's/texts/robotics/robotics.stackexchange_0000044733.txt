Q:

On OSX, rosmake -a could not find roslib

I am trying to install ROS Fuerte on OSX 10.8.2 Mountain Lion.
I followed the step-by-step instructions on:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
It was all successful (with a few modifications though) until I get to run:

sudo rosmake -a

Python reports roslib (1.8.9) not found.
Anyone can help me trouble shooting that?

dyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/sudo) is setuid or setgid
