Q:

STRANGE ERROR! Unable to move Revolute Joints in Gazebo

I'm running : 1. ROS Indigo 2. Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty
I'm simulating a 6DOF robotic arm using ros_control and using gazebo_ros_control plugins. I'm using Joint Position Controllers.
I have set up the .yaml file containing the type of controllers. I have also added all the transmission and gazebo_ros_control tags in my URDF file.
Everything launches without any error. When I try to publish messages on /robot_arm/joint1_position_controller/command topic I'm unable to move the revolute joints. Interestingly I have two continuous joints among my 6DOF which move.
Also these movements are abrupt and not in a smooth manner. Whereas I've tried tutorials where the arm follows a smoother motion using Joint Position Controllers.
How should I get my revolute joints to move? Please help!

Are you perhaps using a Jaco or Mico arm? I had the same issue and just changed them to continuous joints.

Thanks Laurens! Issue sorted out!

hello,I also encounter this problem with revolute joints. Is it was the limit seting problem ?

A:

Issue Solved.
Making the joints continuous works.
But the real problem was that the effort and velocity limits of the revolute joints in my URDF description were set to zero.
