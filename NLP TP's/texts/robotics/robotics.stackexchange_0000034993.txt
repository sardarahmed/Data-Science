Q:

openni detecting device only in debug mode

Hi all,
I'm trying to run the openni_node.launch file on a PR2 with ubuntu lucid and diamondback.
When starting the launch file with "debug=true" the kinect is detected correctly and I can visualize its output in rviz.
However when starting the .launch with "debug=false", the node can't find the device.
The main difference with debug is that it launchs the node on a separate xterm. As far as I have seen, no environement variable is different in the xterm.
Someone has any idea ?

A:

Found out! This was due to another install of openni which was messing things up. Removed it, now it works.
