Q:

roswtf ERROR Communication with [/foo] raised an error

Hi there!
in the ROS architecture I developed messages are sent and received as expected but when I launch roswtf it tells me:

ERROR Communication with [/foo] raised
an error

for every node in the graph. The last line says:

ERROR The following nodes should be
connected but aren't:

with a list of every single connection in the graph.
As I said, the system works fine, "rosnode ping foo" works fine for every single node and if I send message from the console with rostopic pub I don't get any error.
Should I simply skip the errors and move on or is there a reasonable explanation? Thanks.

I defined all messages in one package and then imported this package where needed. Can this explain the weird behavior?

A:

Are you running roswtf on a seperate machine such as your laptop?  And are it's IP/Hostname settings correct? Network setup

everything runs on the same machine. The problem is still there. rxgraph build the graph correctly and I am able to rosping each node. I don't get any error when I start roscore and messages are successfully sent and received.

Thanks for the link, even though it didn't help.
