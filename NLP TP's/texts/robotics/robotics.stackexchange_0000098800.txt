Q:

Can you delete workspace after building/INSTALLING from source?

I built ROS from source on a Raspberry Pi 3 using Raspberry Pi OS (32 bit Raspbian Buster), using the command:
sudo src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/noetic -j1 -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3

Since I have installed to the normal directory where ROS would reside if I had installed it from the binary repository, can I safely delete the workspace and continue using ROS ?  I experimented renaming the workspace and could still use roscd and roscore.  Are there any problems which could show up later ?
I favour doing this to save space on the sd card, and also because catkin_make_isolated wants to rebuild everything even if only my own projects change (I could solve that with an overlay, but it seems cleaner just to lose the initial workspace).

A:

the short answer would be: yes, you can delete the bootstrap workspace after you've ran catkin_make_isolated --install.

Are there any problems which could show up later ?

I don't know about problems per se, but not having your sources around will make it more difficult to Maintain[ing] [your] Source Checkout.

Thanks for the reassurance.  I deleted the directory and so far everything still works.  It is convenient because now I don't need overlayed workspaces.

You're still executing source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash, aren't you?
With that command, you're essentially source-ing the install space of the underlay in /opt/ros/noetic.
There's nothing really special about the files in /opt/ros, it's the same structure as the install space in one of "your own" workspaces.
