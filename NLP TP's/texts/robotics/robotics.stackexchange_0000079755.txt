Couldn't find this answer when searching initially so I wanted to make it more visible.

This seems pretty well documented over at wiki/rosbag/Commandline - play?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-03-23:
Also note btw that it's -l (single dash), not --l.

Looks like you mixed up the shorthand and longhand. As gvdhoorn says, it's rosbag play -l bag_name.bag OR rosbag play --loop bag_name.bag
