Q:

is it possible to run and quit launch files from code inside a node?

Is there a way to run a launch file from code inside a node, and to stop one that has launched (as you would in a terminal window)

Could you actually run a launch file, or just one node like the example shows?  (or is there an equivalent of rosrun roslaunch roslaunch args...?)  Can you post example code?

I didn't try - I managed to do what I needed as an initial test launching and quiting individual nodes
