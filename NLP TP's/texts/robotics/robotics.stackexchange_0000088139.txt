Q:

Visualize 2d objects in 2d image in rviz

Hello,
I would like to visualize some 2d objects using lines or bounding boxes in a 2d image in RVIZ. So far I was not able to find a way. I am suspecting that this might not be supported by RVIZ. But since I only started using ROS it is also likely that I was just looking at the wrong place.
Here is what I found out so far:

I can visualize things in 3D using markers.
I can visualize an image using the display type Image.
I can also visualize an image using the display type camera, and I think if there is correct calibration information, the 3d markers get projected in that image.

But is there a way to directly draw something like the markers into a 2d image?

A:

The easiest way to do this is to make your own node which subscribes to the image topic, draws the markers on top of the image and publishes it on a new topic. I do this for debugging vision algorithms on a regular basis.
The image transport package can be used to receive and publish openCV images, openCV's basic drawing functions are described here.

I really need this..The way draw by a node cannot solve if i have multiple boxes from different node, which will publish too much new images..Is there any way to solve as rviz plugin?
