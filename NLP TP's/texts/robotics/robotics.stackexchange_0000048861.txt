Q:

ROS vs MATLAB...which is best..?

Often i end up with this question. Both of them are powerful softwares; and has more or less similar functionalists. Other than Opensource is there any preferable advantages of ROS over MATLAB.

A:

There is some overlap of functionality between certain ROS tools and libraries and the MATLAB Robotics Toolbox, for controlling robotic arms in particular. So some research labs around the world use MATLAB to write controllers for robotic arms, while other prefer non-MATLAB code written for ROS.
The focus of ROS is a bit more towards solving mobile robot problems, rather then only robotic arms in industrial settings. And a benefit of ROS is that new libraries that have been created can more easily be shared with other researchers in the world, and more easily be integrated with other software on a robot.
