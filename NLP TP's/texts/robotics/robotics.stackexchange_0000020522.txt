Q:

Importing a world into another world in gazebo

Is it possible to start with a with an empty world, empty.world and then import walls (other worlds into it)? I can't seem to find an import option in the gazebo menu.  

A:

If you mean merging other world's contents into an open world file in the Gazebo GUI, no, there is no way to do that.
You can however open the world files in a text editor and just copy contents over. Most worlds are structured as a sequence of <include> tags pointing to external models, so this would be quite easy to do. Notice you can add a <pose> tag inside <include> to shift models around if you need.
