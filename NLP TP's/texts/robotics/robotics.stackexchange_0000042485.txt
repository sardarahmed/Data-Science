Q:

rosbridge connection closed

I have already rosrun rosbridge rosbridge.py
And then when I run a test html file in browser "connection closed" has been showed...why it can`t connect to rosbridge?
html file:

    function main() {
        var connection = new ros.Connection("ws://hostname:9090");
        connection.setOnClose(function (e) {
            document.write('connection closed');
            });
            connection.setOnError(function (e) {
            document.write('error!');
            });
            connection.setOnOpen(function (e) {
            document.write('connected to ROS');
            });
    }

You have no tags on your question, it is unlikely to be found by people who know about these things

A:

Could you test using the head version of rosbridge (svn url: http://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/rosbridge/).  It's possible that you're experiencing a bug that has since been fixed but hasn't propagated to the latest version yet.
As for the "closed 10" error - the current version of rosbridge isn't very good at displaying meaningful errors.  We're currently working on a more robust version of rosbridge which deals with this kind of thing much more gracefully.  For now though, it may say "closed 10" even though you are actually connected.
