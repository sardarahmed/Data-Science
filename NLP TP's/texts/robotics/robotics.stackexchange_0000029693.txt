A:

There is currently no best practice for multiple robots, but there are some commonly used tools for different configurations:

foreign_relay: shuttles data between distinct ROS systems.
zenmaster_sd: uses bonjour to sync data between multiple masters
wifi_comm: combines foreign_relay with discovery
