A:

i've not heard about oasis. for object training and recognition, i think the following two are amazing:
one is tod(texture object detection): http://ros.org/wiki/tod_core
the other is MOPED(Object Recognition and Pose Estimation for Manipulation): http://personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/moped
