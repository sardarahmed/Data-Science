Q:

Unable to locate package camera_calibration

When I do

rosdep install camera_calibration

I get the following error:

ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query

Missing resource camera_calibration
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path 1]=/home/tintin/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share

A similar question was posted here but there isn't a complete solution yet. I tried the solution given there too.

For

sudo apt-get install camera_calibration

I am getting "Unable to locate package camera_calibration"

For

sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-image-pipeline

I am getting "Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-image-pipeline"

A:

From the errors that you posted it looks like you're using Kinetic. I'm not sure about the error that you're getting with rosdep, but the reason that you can't install image_pipeline (which  contains the camera_calibration package) is because you're trying to install the version for Fuerte. Try
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-image-pipeline

You can install many packages using the following command format
sudo apt-get install ros-<distribution>-<package-name>

where <distribution> is the distribution that you're using and <package-name> is the package that you're trying to install.

I tried the same command sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-image-pipelline but with my distribution name which is ros melodic but it have the same error cannot find package what could be the problem then?
