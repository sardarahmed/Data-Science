Q:

Error installing Ros Noetic in Debian Buster

Hello everyone.
I am installing Ros Noetic in my Raspberry PI 4 with Debian Buster because the tutorial said that is fully supported. But when I try to execute the following commnad:
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full

The next error message is received:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-noetic-desktop-full

I obtain the same error trying to install kinetic or melofic and I don't know what to do. I know that Noetic release is very recent, but if the tutorial is written it should work.
Thanks in advance.
Best regrets.

Hello
Today is May 23 and Noetic is not released yet!
Does anyone know the reason?

Edit (2020-05-23): as @sloretz wrote in his comment:

Note however:

I am installing Ros Noetic in my Raspberry PI 4 with Debian Buster

Only the amd64 and arm64 platforms get binary packages of ROS Noetic. armhf packages are not built by the ROS buildfarm.

Original answer:
In addition to @RodBelaFarin's answer (which is correct), I would also add:

I am installing Ros Noetic in my Raspberry PI 4 with Debian Buster because the tutorial said that is fully supported.

There is still this notice at the top of the page under the Installation heading:

This seems to pretty clearly communicate that at least as of today (2020-04-21), there is a high probability of some packages still missing.

This is correct, ROS Noetic is not yet released. There are packages in the ros-testing repo for those who brave enough to try them before release, though desktop_full isn't ready yet.
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros-testing/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-testing.list'
