Q:

hector_slam with Sick TIM561

Hi,
we are working with a robot in a garage or production hall environment to test some car sensors. For mapping we tried an RPlidar (360째) with hector_mapping which is working very well out of the box. Unfortunally the RPlidar has problems to detect parts with black paint or car tires so we tried an Sick TiM561-2050101 which has an angle of 270째 and better resolution.
Despite the higher frame rate (10Hz vs. 15Hz) and better resolution (0,9째/~400pts vs. 0,33째/~800pts) hector_mapping can't match the map on rotations. It's only working on very slow speeds. Mapping with linear movement seems to work on moderate speed.
We tried:

reduce the frame rate
reduce the number of points
moved to a faster computer (from UDOO x86 Ultra on the robot to Intel NUC with i7 cpu)
reduce the FOV

The laser data and slam_cloud is published with ~15Hz.
Why does it work out of the box with RPLidar but not with the Sick LIDAR?

A:

The solution was simple. We have an UDOO x86 Ultra on the robot where hector_slam is running and a control computer (Intel NUC) where the roscore and several other nodes are running. It seems the WiFi was too slow for the higher fps laser data (even with reduced points/fps/fov). We changed our access point from TP-Link Archer C5 to an Ubiquiti and now it's working great.
