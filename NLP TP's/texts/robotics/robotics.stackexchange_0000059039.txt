Q:

ros getparam() question

Hi all,
In reading the tutorial "http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Parameter%20Server", I'm confused in understanding "nh.getParam("/global_name", global_name)". Should I interpret it as "get "/global_name" from the parameter server, and put it in "global_name""? And the "/" means what?
Thanks!

A:

Yes. "/global_name" is the name of the variable on the parameter server. global_name is the variable in your code. The "/" is part of the variable name.
