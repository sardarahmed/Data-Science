A:

Naming conventions can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/Names
1.1.1 Valid Names
A valid name has the following characteristics:

First character is an alpha
character ([a-z|A-Z]), tilde (~) or
forward slash (/)

Subsequent characters can be alphanumeric ([0-9|a-z|A-Z]),
underscores (_), or forward slashes
(/)

Your name starts with a "/" and then consists of alphanumeric charactes, so it's a valid topic name.

Correct information cited, but the first character is only alpha, not alphanumeric. So this is NOT a valid topic name.
Comment by NEngelhard on 2015-09-21:
The first character is a forward slash, which is a valid first character. (And I can create a publisher for this topic without problems or warnings.)

Interesting. It seems that a topic like /_ would be valid.

The intent is that each token must start with an alpha. The ~ is a special replacement and the / is a joiner. I don't know how it's exactly enforced in the different implementations. In the spirit of things starting with a number for a token is not valid.
