Q:

Derive the system's dynamics function and the Jacobian Matrix G of Extended Kalman Filter of a differential drive robot on a 2D plane

I have found the following answer on the system's dynamics function and what the Jacobian matrix G of the Extended Kalman Filter look like for a 2D robot with a differential drive. Taken from slides and source.
Can someone please show me the full derivation? Or maybe you can show me a link that I can use for generating Jacobians for a given function? Any guide would be appreciated.
