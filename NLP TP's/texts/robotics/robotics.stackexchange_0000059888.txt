Q:

Displaying point cloud in browser

I've been looking into displaying a point cloud in the browser using ros3djs and rosbridge. There's a tutorial for streaming point cloud data from a Kinect, but I just want to take a pointcloud2 message and render it with ros3djs. As documented, it seems like it can only take a stream directly from a camera, but is there a way within the current framework to just display directly from a pointcloud2 message?

A:

This must be the tutorial you're talking about (I've only ever seen one)
http://wiki.ros.org/ros3djs/Tutorials/Point%20Cloud%20Streaming%20from%20a%20Kinect
If your point cloud is coming from a topic then that's all you need. The reason this is easy with a camera is because the point cloud sources, nodes, and topics already written and work.
That being said, the PointCloud2 topic over rosbridge websocket is wonky as of indigo, good luck with that..
