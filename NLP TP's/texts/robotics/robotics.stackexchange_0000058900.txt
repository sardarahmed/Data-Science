Q:

Why "Couldn't find an AF_INET address for [TTBA]" always come out?

Hi, I am trying to learn and run multimaster in ROCON with two turtlebots.
I launched amcl in two turtlebots, and try to flip amcl_pose to a server computer TTBA. But several lines with "Couldn't find an AF_INET address for [TTBA]" comes out in some terminals of turtelbots such as the termianl running amcl_demo.launch and the terminal flipping amcl_pose topic to sever TTBA.
I thought it was the wireless network problem. But I did ping from turtlebot two server TTBA. The results was normal.
So has anyone met this problem, or it is just a transient break of wireless link?

I also have the same problem. I have one machine running roscore linked via ethernet to a router. A laptop connects to that router via wifi, and has ROS_MASTER_URI defined. Both machines can ping each other. Laptop publish on /chatter, the other one sees it but can't echo and display that same error
