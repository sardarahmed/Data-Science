Q:

Why doesn't answers.ros.org use HTTPS?

I don't like sending passwords in the clear. With Let's Encrypt available these days it's hard to think of a good reason.

A:

We're working to add encryption to our various services as we have time available. If you would like to securely log in I recommend using one of the several OAuth providers who can authenticate you using https in the mean time.
