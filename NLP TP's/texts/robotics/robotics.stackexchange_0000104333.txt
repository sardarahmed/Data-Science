Q:

ROS Environment variables not set after new Humble install on Ubuntu 22.04

I carefully followed the install instructions for installing ROS2 Humble binary.
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html
The install had no errors. And I did the talker-listener test to make sure.
But none of the ROS environment variables are set.
When I type printenv I don't see ROS_VERSION=2,ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3 or ROS_DISTRO=humble.
The tutorials page just says to go back to the installation page or get help from the community. So here I am :)
Thanks in advance!

A:

To have those environment variables exported in every command line automatically, the easiest thing to do is to add export VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE for each one at the end of the ~/.bashrc file.
After saving, you need to open a new terminal window or call source ~/.bashrc for the changes to take effect.
Edit:
You shouldn't have to export those variables by yourself as those are taken care of by the setup.bash script inside your ros humble instalation.
Please make sure you have your ros installation sourced in ~/.bashrc via source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
