Q:

What exactly does "frame_locked" mean?

Hello, guys.
I am trying to study rivz using this tutorials.
I saw a message,  "frame_locked", parameter of the Marker header.
I found the description for understanding on this link.
But I can not understand what does it mean.

frame_locked [1.1+]
Tells rviz to retransform the marker into the current location of the specified frame every update cycle.

What exactly does "frame_locked" mean?
When can I use it? How it work on?

A:

Without the frame_locked parameter the marker object will be placed into the RVIZ view with the transform at the time it was produced. The location of the marker in RVIZ is then set and will not change in the future even If the TF tree changes.
However if you set the frame locked parameter, future changes to the TF tree will effect the location of the marker. This means changes to the TF tree will be reflected in the markers position in real time.
Hope this helps.
