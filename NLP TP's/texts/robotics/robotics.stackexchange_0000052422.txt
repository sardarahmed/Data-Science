Q:

Include header files in Catkin

Hi,
I am trying to include multiple header files with CATKIN. Therefore, I used include_directories in my CMakeList.txt as shown below:
include_directories(/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation/move_base/include/)
include_directories(/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation/nav_core/include/)
Now, both includes have additional dependencies and therefore require other directories to be included. Since there is quite a number of directories to include, I need to get away of doing this per hand.
My question now:
Is there a way to recursively search for other dependencies and automatically include them?
I appreciate every hint and thank everybody for helping me!
Yours, sincerely
Daniel

A:

A catkin package should not depend on rosbuild packages. This is not a supported use case.

That is it should not depend on rosbuild packages. (non-catkin could include system type dependencies)

What @Dirk Thomas is saying is that as long as navigation is not a catkin package, then to depend on it you will need to use rosbuild. Navigation will be catkinized in Hydro.
