Q:

rxbag extraction of frames

Hello everyone !
I was wondering is there is any steps to follow in order to save all the frames that I put into a rosbag on my computer with rxbag.
I noticed that there is a button "save frames" when you open it with the following :
"View (by type) -> sensor_msgs/Image->stereo/left/image_rect "
I'm able to "select" the frames or should I say the Timeline in the default menu of rxbag (because it's written at the bottom of the image_viewer that it "Save frames from selected region") but it seems to have no effect when I click on the "save frames" button.
any hints ?
Best regards

A:

Found it!
In order to use rxbag (much more efficient than the extract_image node => did not extract all the images of my bags files) you have to :
1°) select with your mouse the length of your timeline (a slightly cyan color show up as you select it)
2°) play your bag file (let it run)
3°) select the view "image"
4°) click on the button on the right of the text "frame%04d.png"
5°) And here normaly pop's up an another window that offers you to save all the frames
Regards
