Q:

How to rearrange rxgraph's position of node?

Because some node is too far when I capture the screen for most important part.
How to move the node's position to the proper location?
Thank you~

A:

I don't think rxgraph allows you to move nodes around (though that would be a welcome contribution).  If you can't see all the nodes, you can left-click and drag the window around to pan and use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom.

Thank you~Zooming window can see all the nodes, but the size is very small to capture the screen sometimes just unseen if open some packages like gazebo. So I want to rearrange all the important nodes for me to put together to a near location to express some ideas.
