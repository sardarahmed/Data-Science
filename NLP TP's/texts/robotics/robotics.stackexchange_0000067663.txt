Q:

unbound frontier_exploration goal

Hello,
I am currently using Ubuntu ARM 14.04 with ROS Indigo ARM.
I am using a actionlib client to send a goal to the explore_server of the frontier_exploration package in order to make my robot ( TurtleBot 2 ) do an unbound exploration of its environment. The problem i have is that, after beginning the exploration it works OK for some time before stopping moving. When it stop moving, it in fact receive goals at his current position, thus cycling though the same patern :
gmapping_demo.launch window
Got new plan
Goal reached
Got new plan
Goal reached

Anyone have an idea why it behave like that ?

A:

This is likely due to goals being generated in the footprint of the robot. frontier_exploration's costmap should be clearing the footprint automatically, however I've found this to be inconsistent. I am working on adding a footprint-goal-filter type of mechanism to an upcoming version of frontier_exploration.
