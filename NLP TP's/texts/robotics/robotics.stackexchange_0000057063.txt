Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: publish a char

hey community,
im a ROS beginner, and my question is
how can i publish a char manualy in a rostopic?
i have published a string with
rostopic pub -1 my_topic std_msgs/String x
but the comand
rostopic pub -1 my_topic std_msgs/Char x
fails
edit:
when i try:
fhduser@fhduser:~/catkin_ws/src/sekuria$ rostopic pub -1 my_topic std_msgs/Char a
i get: [WARN] [WallTime: 1391591690.683859] Inbound TCP/IP connection failed: global name '_x' is not defined
when i try:
fhduser@fhduser:~/catkin_ws/src/sekuria$ rostopic pub -1 my_topic std_msgs/Char data: a
i get:
ERROR: Too many arguments:

Given: [{'data': None}, 'a']

Expected: ['data']

Args are: [data]

A:

This looks like a bug with how std_msgs/msg/_Char.py is generated. Indeed, _x is never defined, whereas in std_msgs/msg/_String.py, it is defined in the serialize function. I would suggest submitting a bug report against ros_comm.
