Q:

Change Odom topic name in Navigation stack

Hello,
I have set up a simple navigation following the default configuration from navigation tutorial
Right now, i am publishing odometry in the odom topic, and works fine, I can see the move_base subscribing to the odom topic. But i want to implement some filteres, so I am publising a filtered odometry message on a second topic name odom_filtered. what i want to know is how could I indicate the navigation stack to use the odom_filtered topic rather than the odom one?
Thanks for your time.

Need more details, what nodes of the navigation stack are you using? Most nodes are using the tf  odom->base_link, not the nav_msgs/Odometry topic. Make sure you are publishing this transform only in one node.
But if you really need to change a topic name for a node, try remap

Thanks for your response, I am using move_base node, and that node was expecting the odometry to be published in the odom topic, so i could simply change the topic odom to odom_raw and use the remap property to change the odometry/filtered to odom, thanks a lot for the response, change the comment to an answer so i can mark it as correct.

A:

using remap as suggested by @humpelstizchen did the trick
