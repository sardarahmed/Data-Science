Q:

rxplot for vector like types

Hi,
trying to plot some fields from a vector-like ROS message, I can't find the right syntax to do so. I have a ROSmsg 'DataMsg' which contains:

uint32 length
float64[] data

And a message on top of that DataMsgs, which has:

DataMsg[] data

How do I plot the data inside e.g. DataMsgs/data[0]/data[0] with rxplot?
I tried various lines, but noone of them worked so far...
regards,
Steven

A:

You're right to use [#] notation with slashes
For example this works:
rxplot /wide_stereo/right/camera_info/D[2]

And thsi works:
rxplot /tf/transforms[0]/transform/translation/x

I'm not finding a vector of vectors at the moment on our system but it should work too.  If you find it doesn't support that file a ticket.
