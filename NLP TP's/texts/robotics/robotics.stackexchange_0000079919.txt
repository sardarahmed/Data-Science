Q:

Workspace on USB or Package on USB

Hello,
I am wondering if I can upload my workspace to a USB? I am guessing you cant because of the file structure of ROS but if I can how does one go about that? If I cant , can I move my packages to a USB?

A:

This should be perfectly possible, provided that your medium is formatted with a compatible file system, as permissions (on fi dynamic reconfigure and other executable files) are important in a Catkin workspace.
File systems like FAT, FAT32 and ExFat are not suitable for this. Something like Ext3 or Ext4 or some other FS that supports regular Linux file permissions should work fine.
