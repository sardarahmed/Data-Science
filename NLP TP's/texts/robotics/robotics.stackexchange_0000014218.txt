Q:

Looking for cheap Xbox/playstation like remote controller for robots

I saw some radio controllers for kids robots alike xbox/playstion game pads few months ago. But I couldn't find them by searching. I am looking for some cheap radio controllers for RC cars or other kids robots like console game pads.May you help me?

A:

What about using an inexpensive 2.4GHz RC transmitter?
I already had one for a WLToys V222 quadcopter
If you don't already have one, you can pick one up on ebay for \$5 to \$15.
I opened up the quadcopter and Identified the chips it used

Mini54 microcontroller
MPU-6050 Motion Tracking Device
BK2423 2.4 GHz Transceiver

Based on this, I found the NRF24L01 which appeared to be compatible which I purchased on eBay for a whopping \$0.67US.  Add a \$15 Arduino Mega (or a $2 Arduino Nano clone) and you are all set to go.
After a bit of time and part in hand I hooked it up to the Arduino and I was able to control a servo using my inexpensive wireless controller.

SUCCESS!!
My guess is that the protocol varies depending manufacturer; so, a bit of reverse protocol engineering may be required.  If you would like more information on the code and config for the controller I used, Up Vote this and add a comment.

There are also 2.4GHz gamepads available for a similar price.  Their protocol might also be a bit different; so, a bit of reverse protocol engineering may be required in that case as well.
