Error in RViz with vision_msgs/Detection3DArray visualization

I am trying to use the Kukanani/vision_msgs_visualization plugin visualize the vision_msgs/Detection3DArray type of data.
I can add in RViz by display type OrkObjectDisplay option. But I get the following error, when I open RViz:
[ERROR] [1697653988.707062524]: PluginlibFactory: The plugin for class 
'vision_msgs_visualization/OrkObjectDisplay' failed to load.  Error: Could 
not find library corresponding to plugin vision_msgs_visualization/OrkObjectDisplay. 
Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the 
library and that the library actually exists.

A:

This error often happened to me when I built the package for the RViz plugin but did not source it in the terminal that starts and runs RViz.
Make sure you source the workspace where "vision_msgs_visualization" lives and run RViz in the same terminal.
