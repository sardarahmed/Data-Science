I checked some similar problems and I found there is no package.xml in my urdfdom folder. But I checked github and could only find package.xml file for hydro or groovy. Does that mean indigo don't need package.xml? I have no idea about how to solve this problem. Really appreciate if someone can help me.

A:

This is not a problem with urdfdom-pkg, but with the way you've setup/initialised your workspace.
If you really must build MoveIt from source (as opposed to using the provided binaries, a sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-moveit away for supported platforms), please follow the appropriate instructions in the MoveIt documentation on how to do a source install.

So you already have MoveIt installed. Do you have a specific reason to want to build it from source again / still?
Comment by Oh233 on 2017-05-14:
No. Just at the beginning I didn't know the difference between binary and source. Hence I installed both binary and source moveit. Problem is now even I delete the source file, there is still error about urdfdom-pkg.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-05-15:
Ok. So you don't want to build moveit from sources any more?
Comment by Oh233 on 2017-05-15:
actually I am ok with either. Just want a solution.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-05-15:
I suggest you try and remove the devel and build directories from your catkin workspace (rm -rf devel, etc), remove the moveit source packages from the src space and then try building your workspace again.
