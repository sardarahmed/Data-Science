Q:

Can message name end in Request?

I defined a message ConfirmRequest.msg and that did not work properly. Catkin did not generate the message automatically and when I forced it by explicitly listing the message  I got problem with linking.
So is "Request" a forbidden ending of a message name? If so is that documented somewhere?

A:

I don't think there's anything explicitly preventing it. However I'd recommend against using that as it will conflict with similarly named service definitions.
