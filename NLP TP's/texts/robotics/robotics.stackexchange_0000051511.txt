A:

You should really configure your system so that you don't have to manually modify device permissions on startup.
For serial devices on most Linux systems, that usually just means adding yourself to the proper group that has access to the serial device, or modifying the udev rules.
You can verify which group has access to the devices by doing ls -l /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyUSB0 ; then add yourself to that group. For example, on Ubuntu the group is dialout, so you would do:
sudo usermod -a -G dialout USER

Please note that you need to log-out and log-in again (or reboot your pc) for this changes to take efffect! After that, it works like a charm here...
