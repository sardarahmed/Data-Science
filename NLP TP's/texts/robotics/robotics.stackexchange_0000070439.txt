Q:

Is anyone using tabletop_object_detector?

I wondered if anyone is using the tabletop_object_detector package. According to the ROS wiki it's not been updated since groovy.
A few questions I had -

How easy would it be to use this package in Indigo?
I'm running into a lot of dependency issues (Especially since this package has not been catkinized) Is there a way to solve this easily?

Sorry for the late reply, but no I was not able to make much progress. I realized that there were too many dependencies that were outdated and experimental.

A:

For anyone who wants to use an object detector ros now has a nice new package for this - http://wiki.ros.org/find_object_2d .
