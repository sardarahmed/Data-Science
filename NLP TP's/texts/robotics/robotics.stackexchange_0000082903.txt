Q:

[SOLVED] How can i install robot_localization?

Hi,
I tried:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-robot_localization

it installed the package but then when i enter:
roslaunch robot_localization ekf_template.launch

I get this:

error loading <rosparam> tag: 
  file does not exist [/opt/ros/kinetic/share/robot_localization/params/ekf_template.yaml]

so i went to /opt/ros/kinetic/share/robot_localization/  and saw that indeed a bunch of files and folders were missing (im comparing to the git repository -> https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization)
i cant download the repository directly into that directory. and theres no build guide for this package.
maybe someone here knows what to do?
thank you
EDIT:
Ok so i found a workaround. instead of using  $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-robot_localization
I went into my catkin_ws src folder and opened a terminal. then i entered:
git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization.git

then
cd ~/catkin_ws 
catkin_make

now its installed correctlly with all the files and folders :)

You should write up your solution as an answer

This looks like an oversight in the upstream package. I've filed the following PR:

Hi i'm new to ROS (and Linux also). may i ask, so what happened here? it wasnt wrong to use "sudo apt-get install" ? using that command should have worked right off the bat?

You did everything right. It's just the particular parameter file that that launch file depended on wasn't being installed by the binary version of the package. This is a bug for the package maintainer to fix, but you successfully worked around it by building from source and using the devel space.

Thank you very much mikepurvis.
I think i'm finally starting to get how ROS works.
man the beginning is kinda tough, especially if youre also totally new to linux
very nice community here thanks for the awesome explanation :)
