Does someone have a way to launch gazebo without GUI from launch file?

A:

I use launch.actions.ExecuteProcess to launch Gazebo.
So let's say your normal Gazebo process looks like this:

    ...
    gz_process = ExecuteProcess(cmd=`gazebo`, '--verbose', LaunchConfiguration('world'),
                                    '-s', 'libgazebo_ros_factory.so'], output='screen')
    ...
       return LaunchDescription([
         ...
            DeclareLaunchArgument(name='world', default_value=default_world_path,
                                  description='Absolute path to SDF world file'),
            gz_process,
         ...
        ])

Instead of calling gazebo there, you can call gzserver. You can do this using a Launch Argument or just a seperate launch file all together.
