Q:

ros workspace on an ntfs file system?

Can your ros_workspace folder be located on an NTFS file system?
I'm using ros electric and a wubi install of ubuntu 11.10.
I've added a new hard drive that I want both windows and linux to access, and I'd like to move my ros_workspace folder to the new hard drive. Unfortunately when I run my nodes from the new environment I get:
$ rosrun loader_testing boomPosCnt
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named boomPosCnt below /media/may2013/ros_workspace/loader_testing
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /media/may2013/ros_workspace/loader_testing/bin/boomPosCnt
When I switch the environment back to the old workspace in my home folder (ext4 file system) the nodes run fine. Thanks!
