Q:

How do you find the current camera pose?

When the gui is running, how do you find the x/y/z/r/p/y of the current camera pose? It seems to be the only thing not listed in the left-hand panel.

you could find out using a GUI plugin, by getting the position of the user camera.

I meant as a user, through the standard GUI.

A:

It's not ideal, but you can Save World As from the File menu, and it will put the camera pose in the <world><gui> block. We should make it easier to view though. Would you mind making a feature request on bitbucket?
