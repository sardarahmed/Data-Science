Q:

Nested stack dependency

Assume stack A depends on ros stack and its stack.xml file has " and assume that I create another stack B which depends on stack A and stack ros. If B's stack.xml specifies , does stack B also inherit "ros" stack as its dependency or do I need to explicitly specify  as well? Thanks.

A:

It depends on how the stack dependency is converted -- if it is used to generate debian package dependencies, then, yes, it is inherited.
That said, it is better to explicitly enumerate your actual dependencies.  For example, an intermediary stack can change its dependencies, and so you might suddenly be without this implicit dependency.
