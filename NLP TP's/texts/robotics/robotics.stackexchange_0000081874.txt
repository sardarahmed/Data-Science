Q:

catkin_make fails with Invalid email and Invalid package

When I try to catkin_make my workspace the following is output:
Base path: /home/user/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/user/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/user/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/user/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/user/catkin_ws/install
Package name "${pkg_name}" does not follow naming conventions
Invalid email "${email}" for person "${author}"
Invalid email "${email}" for person "${author}"

When I try to launch a launchfile which had been working fine before (and nothing changed on the file or the related files):
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 225, in main

    raise InvalidPackage('\n'.join(errors))
InvalidPackage: Package name "${pkg_name}" does not follow naming conventions
Invalid email "${email}" for person "${author}"

What I did do before this occurred was following the "Create your rqt plugin package" tutorial and at some point ran cmake on the package which added a bunch of folders and files to my catkin workspace (in retrospect, I think I misunderstood the wording on the tutorial...) I tried deleting the new stuff but that just caused more errors.
I'm not sure what exactly happened and how to fix it. Any help is appreciated.
EDIT: The problem turned out to be exactly what the error message said, there was actually a package.xml with the placeholders ${pkg_name} etc in the catkin workspace. Removed that and everything worked again.

A:

Sorry I was unclear, I had removed the new files but since that caused even more problems, put them back again. I took another look and there was actually a package.xml with the placeholders, removing that solved the problem.
