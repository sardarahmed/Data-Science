Q:

pointcloud_to_laserscan, how to change the slice height

Hi everyone,
I am running the pointcloud_to_laserscan package successfully with a Kinect. Now I want to change the height/angle at which the laser takes the slice from the pointcloud. Probably I am missing something, but none of the parameters described in
[http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan]
do what I want. I supposed that the parameters min_height and max_height were defined for this. But in stead, this parameters only select the points of the slice that are within this height range. Any guess?
Thanks!

A:

Having just looked at the code; the height parameters seem to slice in the pointcloud orthogonal to the z axis in the height interval between min_height and max_height.
There are the parameters angle_min and angle_max, they are referring to the width of the simulated laserscan. So, that is not what you are looking for either.
I guess you may need to transform the pointcloud that are going into the pointcloud_to_laserscan, maybe just changing the reference frame.

Indeed no such parameter, how about forking the code and adding one? (I could use it as well sometimes soon)
