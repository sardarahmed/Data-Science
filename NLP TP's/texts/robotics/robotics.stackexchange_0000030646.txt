Q:

kinect's rgb camera with camera_calibration

Hello everyone,
The calibration tutorial applied to the kinect rgb camera searches for a service that isn't published by the openni driver. This results in
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x5 --square 0.02994444 image:=/camera/rgb/image_color camera:=/camera
Waiting for service /camera/set_camera_info ...
Service not found
Hasn't anybody used the camera_calibration package to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the kinect camera? I'd need them for the handeye calibration.
cheers

A:

The intrinsic calibration for the Kinect is already available in the Openni driver. This answer describes where to find it.
You'll want to use the 'camera/rgb/camera_info' topic, which gives a sensor_msgs/CameraInfo message.
