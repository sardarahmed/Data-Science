Q:

running different nodes from a shell script

I have different nodes from different packages and I want to run it from a single shell script. The description is given below:
I have 3 different packages and each package contains 3 different nodes
(sample directory structure)
    package_name1
    |— src
        |— node1_node.cpp
    |— CMakeLists.txt
    |— package.xml
    
    package_name2
    |— src
        |— node2_node.cpp
    |— CMakeLists.txt
    |— package.xml
    
    package_name3
    |— src
        |— node3_node.cpp
    |— CMakeLists.txt
    |— package.xml

Each package has 1 executable. Every time I have to go to each executable path and execute. Instead of that I want to write a single script which will run the 3 different executable from 3 packages.
Is there a way to do that?
I tried by running the script:
cd path_to_package_name1/devel/lib/package_name1
./node1_node
cd path_to_package_name2/devel/lib/package_name2
./node2_node
cd path_to_package_name3/devel/lib/package_name3
./node3_node

But it is executing only the first node.How can I execute the 3 nodes together?

A:

Unless you have a specific reason to use them, I would stay away from using shell scripts.
To start individual nodes, use rosrun: rosrun pkg_name node_name.
To start entire applications, use roslaunch: roslaunch pkg_name some_file.launch.
See #q268337 for an older question about this.

And if you haven't yet, also take a look at the wiki/Using rqt_console and roslaunch - Using roslaunch tutorial. That should have covered this.
Have you done the basic tutorials?

And I'm linking to the eu mirror of the wiki as it appears to be down right now.

I usually run the executable directly rather than using rosrun. But when I used rosrun the following error occured:
'package not found'
I sourced the setup.bash file of the workspace and appended the src path to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.But the error remained the same.
Any suggestions on this?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-27:
I would really recommend you start using rosrun for this.

appended the src path to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

don't do that. Ever.
Please edit your question with the complete error message that you get, and with the output of ls -al /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src.

Also: I only mentioned rosrun as you were starting binaries directly, which is not really 'the ROS way'.
Your question is/was about starting multiple nodes properly, which is really what roslaunch was created for.

Thanks for your answer and suggestion. I found out why it was giving  'package not found' . There was a space in my file path. Really sorry to bother you for this.
I am now able to use roslaunch and run the applications. Thanks for suggesting the ros way of running it.

You're welcome. No need to apologise.
