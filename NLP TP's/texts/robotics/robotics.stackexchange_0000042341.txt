Q:

Create a map building with kinect

Hi
I am using ubuntu 11.04, electric and kinect with openni.
I only study tutorials (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials)
and openni_launch (http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_launch).
I'm still new to ROS.
I want to build 3D indoor map.
But I don't know what to do.
How to create maps using ROS and Kinect?
Can you teach method, tutorial, material etc. ?
please~~
