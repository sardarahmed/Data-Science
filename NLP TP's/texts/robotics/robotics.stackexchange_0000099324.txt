Q:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:

Hello guys,
now I did some tutorials about MoveIt and have met some errors. I followed the instructions from https://moveit.ros.org/install/source/ and when I run 'rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}', the error was like:

To get it out of the way: do you absolutely need to build MoveIt from sources?
Comment by ruiaisun on 2021-06-22:
Yes. To use some motion planners. This problem is solved! I just remove miniconda. Thank you for asking.

This does not seem like it's a duplicate question.
Please also post your solution as an answer below and then accept your own answer.
That way it's clear you've solved it.

A:

I remove the miniconda and than the problem is gone.
