Q:

Where to find good Dynamixel models (license)?

Is there a package containing dynamixel models already?
Or does anybody know if I can get the models under BSD
or similar license (GPL ...) to add it to my package (robot file)?
Regards,
Christian

I don't know how they are licensed, but CAD files are available at http://en.robotis.com/BlueAD/board.php?bbs_id=downloads&mode=view&bbs_no=26324&page=1&key=&keyword=&sort=&scate=DRAWING.

Thanks, I guess I need to check for the license ... or ask for it.
