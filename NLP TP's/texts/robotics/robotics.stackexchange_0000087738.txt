Q:

Best practice for Ackermann car to follow a path

Hi all,
I have built a MIT-Racecar which has Ackermann and VESC.  The car can be driven with ackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped type messages in ROS.
Now I would like to drive the car along a particular path to collect some videos with the camera on the car. The path consists of straight and curved segments. You can imagine the path as in a shape of "8" in a 30x30 yard region. Please note this is NOT autonomous driving. I can drive the car with teleop, an customized ROS node, etc. All I want is that the car follows the path accurately.
I am not very good in using teleop. So my first idea is to write a ROS node. I can collect some measurements of the path and calculate a serial of speed and steering parameters and let the ROS node send them out as AckermannDriveStamped message. The advantage of this method is that I can continue improve my speed/steering numbers and make the control more and more accurate. But I have two questions:

Is this approach the best practice to make the car follow a pre-defined path?

If this is the best way, is there any existing method to convert a known path to a serial of speed and steering numbers for ackermann? I think this may be a part of Path Planing, but I am not sure.

Thank you very much.

I am also working on the predefined path problem for the navigation stack.
Here are some questions available:

@aarontan could you please let me know the approach you used?

From Question 2, I wrote a custom global planner plugin with a predefined path, in this case a circle with a fixed radius. From the video attached with the question, you can see that my robot is able to follow this global path; however, no obstacle avoidance. You can customize the code for any path.
