Q:

How can I send a SIGINT to a single node?

I have a process that will cause roslaunch to shutdown with a SIGINT. I've found out that roslaunch has a maximum wait time of 15 seconds before it will escalate to a SIGTERM. This is occasionally not long enough for my reporter node to gracefully close since it will perform calculations and prepare a report when a SIGINT is received.
I think I can get around this if I can send a SIGINT directly to this node (not through roslaunch) and then afterwards I could send a SIGINT to roslaunch. Is there a way to do this? I read about using rosnode kill but that will not trigger a SIGINT.

A:

You could send a using basic linux methods to the process, but I don't think this would be a clean solution.
This thread:
http://answers.ros.org/question/27655/what-is-the-correct-way-to-do-stuff-before-a-node-is-shutdown/
contains a very good example for implementing both, rosnode kill and SIGINT handler. I you implemented your node following this pattern you could trigger its shutdown via rosnode kill.
