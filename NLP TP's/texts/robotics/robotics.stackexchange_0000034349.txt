Q:

What is the difference between tf and tf2?

What does tf2 add that tf doesn't have and why would I choose one over the other? It isn't clear to me what the difference is ... thanks.

A:

tf2 is a new implementation of tf with better abstraction and dependency isolation.  See the wiki page for an overview: tf2  The design of the new version is documented on the tf2/Design page.
tf2 is still experimental and in the geometry_experimental stack and it is still recommended to use the tf package until tf2 is released in the geometry stack.

This http://answers.ros.org/question/77061/tf2-migration-for-hydro/ and http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Migration#tf2.2BAC8-Migration.General_Backwards_compatability says tf is deprecated in hydro, "It is recommended for new work to use tf2 directly as it has a cleaner interface."
