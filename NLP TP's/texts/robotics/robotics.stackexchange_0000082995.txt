Q:

Depth Sense Camera to PointCloud2 in RVIZ?

Hello all,
I am currently running on ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu and would like to know how am i supposed to display the raw data captured from my Soft Kinetic DS 325 camera to a pointcloud on rviz? Currently I am not able to view any topics when i open rviz. Help would be very much appreciated. Thank you!
Currently i have 4 terminals running (Images are attached below):
1)roscore
2) the depthsense viewer software downloaded from their website
3) the terminal in which i am trying to run a launch file i cloned off github , with the error
4) rviz ( the screenshot with what i view in rviz is also attached below)

Are you running the node that runs the Kinect?

Hi, I'm not using a Kinect but a depth sense camera so I believe the node is known as " softkinetic_camera" . I've tried running it but it just gives me an error of not being able to launch type of node.

Please update your question with a copy and paste of how you are running it and the error.

Hi all i have updated the questions with the supported screen shots. Thank you for helping

from the rviz screenshot, i could say that you have to add pointcloud topic to view it,  can you share "rqt_graph" screenshot.

hello! i have updated with the screenshots from both rviz and the rqt graph. currently, what i am trying to achieve is for my camera to view the yellow tape as a point cloud in rviz. and i would like to ask, how to link the base camera link with my map in rviz?

choose the camera frame in rviz by selecting "Global Options-->Fixed Frame-->"
