Q:

How do I Publish pcd files in my folder on a topic?

So I have 100 pcd files.
they look like this
VERSION .7
FIELDS x y z rgb
SIZE 4 4 4 4
TYPE F F F U
COUNT 1 1 1 1
WIDTH 38092
HEIGHT 1
VIEWPOINT 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
POINTS 38092
DATA ascii
224 0 681 2172952
229 0 662 2107159
....
Now I want to publish these files one by one on a topic . How do I do that?
I have gone through the pcl ros tutorials.They subscribe to a topic, do some processing inside the call back function and then they publish it on a topic.
What I want to do is just publish these pcd files on a topic
thanks

A:

Check out the wiki page for pcl_ros.  In particular, it depends on what ROS message type you'd like to publish.  If your PCD contains generic pointCloud data, then it looks like you could probably use pcd_to_pointcloud, which publises ROS PointCloud2 messages:
 $ rosrun pcl_ros pcd_to_pointcloud <file.pcd> [ <interval> ]
