Q:

rosdep Error With rviz

Hi,
I'm trying to build rviz for ROS, but I seem to run into this error:

$rosdep install rviz

Failed to find rosdep eigen for package rviz on OS:fedora version:16
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install eigen

How exactly does rosdep do to install dependencies?
Thanks!

A:

That means that there is no rule for installing "eigen" on Fedora.  You will need to figure out the proper way to install eigen on your own.  You can help future Fedora users by contributing a rule for eigen back, following the instructions here:
