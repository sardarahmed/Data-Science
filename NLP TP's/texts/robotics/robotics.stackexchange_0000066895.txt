Q:

How can I know the AR.Drone's height in order to control it?

I tried for getting the value of "altd" in /ardrone/navdata and what ever the position of the drone and even the state of drone like flying, landing, landed.. etc the "altd" value is always zero. I want to use this value for many things so please someone help me in getting the height of the drone.
Below is the screenshot of navdata of my drone when subscribed to /ardrone/navdata topic:

What is the firmware version of the AR-Drone? Is it AR-Drone 1.0 or 2.0?

A:

I believe that you can get altitude data even if it is not in flight by subscribing to the /ardrone/navdata_altitude topic. You will have to modify the ardrone.launch file so that the enable_navdata_pressure_raw parameter is set to true. Just copy and paste this:
<param name="enable_navdata_pressure_raw" value="true" />

and add it between the <node> and </node> tags of the launch file. In order to use this data you will have to include the navdata_altitude message/datatype and access it in your callback function using data.altitude_raw.
