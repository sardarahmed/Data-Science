Q:

Why does robot_model fail in rosinstall

I get the following when rosinstall hits the robot_model line in .rosinstall:
- hg: {local-name: robot_model, uri: 'https://kforge.ros.org/robotmodel/robot_model',
    version: robot_model-1.4.0}

This despite having Mercurial installed via macports and having several other hg lines in my .rosinstall which install fine. What's going on?
Installing https://kforge.ros.org/robotmodel/robot_model robot_model-1.4.0 to /Users/my_name/ros/robot_model

A:

Looking closer the line which is failing(rosinstall:115) reads: "Failed to detect %s presence at %s."%(self.vcsc.type, self.path"  which suggests that it is finding the path exists already but it does not detect a mercurial checkout in the place.
I suggest deleting that path and running it again.

That did it, and by "that" I mean that I deleted the robot_model path and re-ran rosinstall. Not quite sure what went wrong there.
