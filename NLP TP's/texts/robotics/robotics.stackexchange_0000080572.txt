Q:

Error in ROS MoveIt! while loading an URDF

Hello Everyone,
I am new to the world of ROS and MoveIt!
I was following a Tutorial for MoveIt! from Youtube but unfortunately I seem to have hit a dead end !
The link to the video is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4dtSRvlAjg&t=211s \
The files can be found here : https://github.com/andrewneill/abb_irb1600id_support
I was wondering if anyone has seen errors similar to what I am getting in my system.  I have attached a log of the Errors and Warning which I am getting.

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/4d8f49c1054b1c319811f7dd509b609e

I would be very grateful if someone can try to import the URDF and suggest ways to eliminate the issues I am facing.
Btw, I am using Ubuntu 14.4 and ROS Indigo.
Any leads would be deeply appreciated.
Kind Regards,
Sagnik Basu Choudhuri

A:

[ERROR] [1493769151.230318708]: Error retrieving file [package://abb_irb1600id_support/meshes/irb1600id/visual/link_6.stl]: Package [abb_irb1600id_support] does not exist

I actually feel like this is one of the few times where the error message is quite clear: it basically tell you that the package abb_irb1600id_support cannot be found anywhere.
Do you actually have that package in your workspace?

Hey there,
Thanks for getting back to me.
I did realize that and did move the package to my Workspace. I did that once again later in the day and it worked like a charm.
Thanks a lot fot your help, I am sure I made some mistake the first time round.

Could you please help me with this error as well as in where do I need to look :

I'm not sure I understand you: have you placed the abb_irb1600id_support package in your workspace, built your workspace, sourced the setup.bash and then retried? That should be enough to at least avoid the errors you've copy-pasted.
