Q:

Migration from hydro to kinetic

I need to find a kinetic kame driver for a motor controller (Roboteq AX2550) but the closest thing I found was a driver from hydro ( https://github.com/wjwwood/ax2550 ). After copying it from github, I can't figure out how to convert it over to kinetic kame.
In CMakeLists.txt, I changed
find_package(catkin REQUIRED
COMPONENTS
geometry_msgs
nav_msgs
roscpp
serial
serial_utils
tf
)
to
find_package(catkin REQUIRED NO_MODULE)
as per instructions on http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Migration
but then it says
"If you were using the exported dependency list to pass a CMake module name that will not work anymore. You will need to find the CMake module manually in your CMake extra file. "
I have no idea what this means. How do I find those CMake modules manually? What/where is that CMake extra file?

A:

I was going about it all wrong, I didn't have to modify anything
I deleted the directory with the kinetic driver and re-copied the github directory. Then I added a few other directories from github into my catkin_ws/src folder.

common_msgs
serial
serial_utils

and now it passes catkin_make
