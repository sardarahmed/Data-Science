Q:

Launch file for package not running with rosrun

Hi,
I am making a package to communicate with an Arduino that I have on my robot to control it. I have the package on github here. When I run  rosrun ros_arduino_python arduino.launch I get the following error:

/home/lukas/catkin_ws/install/share/ros_arduino_python/ros_arduino_python/launch/arduino.launch: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token newline' /home/lukas/catkin_ws/install/share/ros_arduino_python/ros_arduino_python/launch/arduino.launch: line 1: '

Sorry about the formatting, I gues ros like using the little backwards quotes...
Anyway, here is my launch file, arduino.launch:
     <launch>
     <node name="arduino" pkg="ros_arduino_python"
 type="arduino_node.py"
 output="screen">
     <rosparam file="$(find ros_arduino_python)/config/my_arduino_params.yaml"
 command="load" />
     </node>
     </launch>

The rest of the code is on github. I am only 13 so the more help I can get the better.
Thanks,
L

A:

Try the command
roslaunch ros_arduino_python arduino.launch

The rosrun command is for starting individual nodes and the roslaunch command is for kicking off launch files.

Thanks for the answer, that solved it. I also found that I needed to chmod +x the python file so it would execute...
Thanks,
