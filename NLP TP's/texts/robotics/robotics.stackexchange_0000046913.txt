Q:

PTAM to reconstruct scene

Hi guys,
Do anyone of you know how to reconstruct scene model/area from the information obtained from PTAM (using point cloud maybe) or any visual slam algo like RGBD SLAM or V-Slam.
Thanks

A:

You might want to try the Multiresolution Surfel Map package available on
code.google.com/p/mrsmap
It performs RGB-D-SLAM in real time on a CPU.
For details see this paper:
