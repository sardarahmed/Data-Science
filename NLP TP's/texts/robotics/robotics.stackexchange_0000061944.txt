Q:

Turn Kinect in the left and the right

Hi;
I used the openni function xnUSBSendControl to move the KInect's motor up and down, and now I'm looking to turn that motor in the left and right.
Thanks

You may be interested in the kinect_aux package for tilting the Kinect using a ROS interface.

A:

There is no motor inside the kinect to control the left/right direction. There is only one motor, and it is for controlling the up/down direction. If you look at Step 5 of ifixit's Kinect Teardown, you can see the single motor.
