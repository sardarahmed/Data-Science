Q:

"sudo rosmake" permission denied problem

Hello,
I'm trying to install the rgbdslam package and following the installation instructions here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/RGBD-6D-SLAM
I've svn checked out "rgbdslam" and "hogman_minimal" packaged into my "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks" directory.
When I try to issue the command "rosmake --rosdep-install rgbdslam" it gives an error mid-way into the installation saying "mkdir: cannot create directory `build': Permission denied". Naturally, I tried adding sudo infront of the command, but then I get the error "sudo: rosmake: command not found".
What is wrong?
Here are the lines from my bashrc file, in case this has to do with some incorrect environment paths:
source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

A:

In case someone else stumbles across this question: note that the /opt/ros package directories are intended to be shared by all users on that system.
Modifying their contents is not a good idea.
As shark hinted above, if you need to modify one of the installed packages, check the sources for its stack out of the source repository, placing them ahead of the /opt/ros stacks in the $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Then, use rosmake normally to build your modified version. That way, tools like svn diff or git diff make it easy to submit your changes as a patch.

This applies even for a single-user machine. If you have installed ROS via Ubuntu packages, the package manager will not preserve changes you made to /opt/ros, so you will end up like http://http://answers.ros.org/question/2304
