Q:

Properly flashing the firmware on a Lego Mindstorms NXT

I am attempting to upload a custom firmware to a Lego Mindstorms NXT and am having issues.
First of all, I'm attempting to use nxtOSEK, which would let me run C++ programs on it.  The problem is, everytime I put it into firmware update mode, the download doesn't seem to actually occur.
What I mean by this is that, according to the output in my terminal (both Mac and Windows), the download was successful, however when the NXT reboots, I still see the normal logo (not nxtOSEK).
So, what I'm doing is first holding down the Reset button for a few seconds, then hitting the orange button, giving me that tic-tic-tic sound.  Then I run the firmware update (either using the Windows NextTool or Mac OSX GUI NextTool) and attempt the download.  I get a success message, yet the robot is still using the old firmware.
What could be the cause of this problem and how can I solve it?

A:

The reason why you can't see the nxtOSEK logo, is that the enhanced firmware looks the same as the regular firmware, but with several performance and feature enhancements. It isn't specific to nxtOSEK.
To check if the firmware installed properly, visit the Settings menu on the NXT, and then the NXT Version submenu. The top line should read: FW NBC/NXC x.xx, where x.xx is the version number of the firmware.
