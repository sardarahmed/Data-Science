Could you include the actual error that you are seeing in your question? That would make answering it a bit easier.

A:

# ./devel/lib/robot_description/parser /src/robot_description/urdf/my_robot.urdf

assuming the binary parser actually exists in ./devel/lib/robot_description, it would seem you pass it an absolute path (ie: /src/..). Does that path exist on your system? What is the output of ls /src/robot_description for instance?
Additionally, does robot_description in src contain a directory urdf with a my_robot.urdf file in it?
Assuming all yes to the above, and you are in your catkin_ws (or wherever both devel and src are located), try the following:
./devel/lib/robot_description/parser ./src/robot_description/urdf/my_robot.urdf
