Q:

Can inverse dynamics control be regarded as a function?

I know that inverse kinematics ($p \rightarrow q$, p: desired pose of the end-effector, q: joint angles) is not a function because there might be multiple joint angle vectors q that result in the same pose p.
By inverse dynamics control I mean the mapping $(q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q}) \rightarrow u$ (u: required torques. I am not very experienced with these kind of problems. Is the mapping a function, i.e. for each triple $(q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q})$ there is a unique solution u? My intuition says it is. But I am not sure. If there is not, would it always be possible to obtain a solution by averaging two or more solutions?

A:

I think you are confusing 2 issues.  Inverse dynamics is the process of mapping end effector position, velocity, and acceleration to joint torques.  as described in this book, page 298: http://books.google.com/books?id=jPCAFmE-logC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA298#v=onepage&q=inverse%20dynamics&f=false
But the paper you posted is simply modeling and calibrating their robot's non-geometric parameters.  
So i think there can be multiple solutions to the inverse dynamics problem as i define above.  because when only given the end effector parameters, the arm can potentially be in different configurations to realize this.  a simple example is a 2 link planar arm where the elbow can be on either side.  as seen in figure 2.31, page 93: http://books.google.com/books?id=jPCAFmE-logC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q=two-link%20planar%20arm&f=false
but i still think the problem as you describe, mapping joint position, velocity, and acceleration to joint torques is a low-level control problem and probably has a unique solution.  however, when factoring in nonlinearities like friction can probably make the answer non-unique.  for example, imagine a joint with lots of friction.  a range of joint torques will be sufficient to hold the joint at a given angle.
