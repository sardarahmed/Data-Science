Q:

mapviz: No transform between /wgs84 to odom

I am running robot_localization with an IMU and a GPS. I can visualize the pose estimation it in mapviz and it looks good. Now I want to set the plug-in Tile_map (with MapQuest) but i am having this error message "No transform between /wgs84 and odom" and i am not sure what to do.
thanks in advance

A:

Ok, I "solved" it by using
rosrun swri_transform_util initialize_origin.py

I said "solved" because my tf tree looks weird  (it is not a tree).
It looks like:
imu_link -> base_link
far_field -> origin
              -> far_field_identity
map -> map_identity
odom
