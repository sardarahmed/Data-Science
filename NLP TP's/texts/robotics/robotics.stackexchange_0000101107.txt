Q:

ROS2: Turtlebot3 tutorial. launch error

Hi there! I'm using turtlebot3 and i got a problem.
My system is ROS2 Foxy, Ubuntu 20.04LTS
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation
In this tutorial, I had installed simulation packages. It was good.
But in the second tutorial that launch the packages, the error occurred.
The error is here
~/turtlebot3_ws$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
~/turtlebot3_ws$  ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo empty_world.launch.py
Package 'turtlebot3_gazebo' not found: "package 'turtlebot3_gazebo' not found, searching: ['/opt/ros/foxy']"
I think he said "I couldn't find the package!"
so I paste the [turtlebot3_gazebo] package directory into the route where contain packages. [ /opt/ros/foxy/share ].
But same error still occurred.
what is wrong?
thank you : >

A:

I fixed my error.
This was a problem related to the use of the Catkin Package.
It is important to type it's source using the path.
In my case, path is [ ~/turtlebot3_ws/install ]
So type below line in the terminal would be good solution.

source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash

Have a good day!
