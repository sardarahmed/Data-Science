Q:

Kinetic Robot hardware setup

Would this be a good setup? Im mostly interested on the MB/CPU/PSU and battery
MB: www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813186211
CPU: www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115078
PSU: www.logicsupply.com/products/picopsu_160
Battery: www.batterymart.com/p-12v-7ah-sealed-lead-acid-battery.html
Case: www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=37_111&product_id=63#.UMlFRbT3BT5
Also i'll be using a Arduino/Arbotix and a motor controller for controlling motors, and servos.
Anything i should change? or look into?
Edit: I want to build a robot, that will create a map of its location using the kinetic, also i want to add 1-2 hands to it, that he can use to grab objects and open doors... Hands will use servos.

A:

Your question is still vague. But you are missing a way to do some I/O and a motor-controller. Look in to the ros serial package and get an arduino (for instance) and a big motor controller.
