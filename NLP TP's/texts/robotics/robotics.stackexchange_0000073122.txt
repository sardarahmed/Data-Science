Q:

Convert from PointCloud to PCD

Hi, I wanted to convert my point cloud (of type sensor_msgs::PointCloud2) published in a topic /X to pcd file. I used the builtin rosnode pointcloud_to_pcd (from the tuto http://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros#pointcloud_to_pcd ). What I typed was:

rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd input:=/X

I verified there are messages coming in the topic / X using rostopic echo.
However, at the end, I didn't get a .pcd file in the directory where I launched the rosnode. Do you guys have an idea?

Hi. Thank you.I don't quite understand your question. Normally, according to the tuto, pcl_ros will output the .pcd file in the directory where I launch this pcl_ros node.

A:

Hi. I just discovered the error I committed. Actually, although there 's message  (of type sensor_msgs::PointCloud2) coming into the topic /X, they contain no data(no coordinates x,y and z). That's why at the end of the pointcloud-to-pcd conversion, I got no .pcd file.
