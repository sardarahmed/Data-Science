Q:

How to view xacro in graphiz

You can use urdf_to_graphiz to quickly check your URDF's links. How do you do this directly with an Xacro file?
Currently, you have to directly convert it first, but this is a little clunky:
rosrun xacro xacro.py -o mybot.urdf mybot.urdf.xacro
urdf_to_graphiz mybot.urdf

A:

Afaik you cannot do this 'directly'. Those tools try to kiss: xacro.py only coverts to urdf, urdf_to_graphviz takes a urdf and creates a diagram.
