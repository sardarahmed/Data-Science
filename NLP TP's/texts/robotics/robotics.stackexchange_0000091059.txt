Please don't use an image to display text. Copy and paste the text from the image to your question instead.

A:

The same way you would in any other situation with a set of numbers you'd like to save to a file, how would you go about that? You could serialize the ROS message, but that doesn't sound like what you really want, you just want numbers. You can stream them to a file and save the file. Just access what you want from the message class and write to file in whatever way makes sense to you.
