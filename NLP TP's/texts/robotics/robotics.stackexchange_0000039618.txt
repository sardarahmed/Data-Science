Q:

Compiler cant find transformLaserScanToPointCloud function

Hi,
I am quite new to ROS and also programming :) and facing a problem during making executable for node for converting laser scan to get point cloud from my laser scanner data. Can you please have a look on the error and tell me what can be the reason. I also added the dependencies. Everything looks to be fine. Thanks in advance.

A:

Two possibilities: you're sure you've added laser_geometry as a depend in your manifest.xml? Like, double-plus-sure?
Another possibility: are you sure laser_geometry is installed? If you've done a source install (and have the dependency set), try using rosmake to build your package, not just make. If you're using a binary install, double-check that the laser_geometry package is installed.

I have the same problem, I downloaded the laser_geometry from the source but I have package.xml not mainfest.xml which is different somehow and I still haave the same problem when I add it to the package.xml file.. do i have to add anything in the Cmakelist
