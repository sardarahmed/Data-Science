Q:

Is it possible to run ROS2 Humble and Ubuntu 22.04 on a Jetson Nano Orin (other than through Docker)?

is it possible to run ubuntu 22.04 to install and run ROS2 on a Jetson Nano Orin? I have mainly seen solutions using Docker but it would be much easier for me to not have to go through docker and better for my use case, as I will be using RViz and Gazebo a lot.

A:

You can build from source, I have a video about this actually
