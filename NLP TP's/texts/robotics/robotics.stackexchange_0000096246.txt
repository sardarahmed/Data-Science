Q:

Create a urdf/xacro file from model of FreeCAD

Hello everyone.
I have created the following model in FreeCAD of a robot with differencial cinematic system (back wheels do the traction):

I would like to create the urdf/xacro files to see it navigating in Rviz from this model, but I don't know if it is possible or I have to write theese files by myself.
I am using ROS melodic version.
Any help I would be very grateful.
Best regards.
Alessandro

A:

Hello, I post a new autoanswer because finally I found a solution.

In FreeCAD export the model as Collada (.dae).
Copy the file into your package, in a folder called "meshes".
Create an urdf file with the following content:

`
  
    
      
      
        
      
    
  `
(I donÂ´t know why the format of the code is wrong)

Launch the urdf file with robot_state_publisher package as normal.

With this I can use my model of FreeCAD to see it in rviz, without create a complex urdf file.
Best regards.

This gets you a static mesh. It visualises in RViz yes, but that's not what people typically want when they ask how to convert <insert CAD program here> to URDF.

Yes, I know is a static mesh, but for my application is enough because my robot just have the wheels as mobile part, so I just want to visualize the robot. Thank you for the information by the way.
