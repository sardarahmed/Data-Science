Q:

How do I find which debian package a stack is in?

Is there a way to search through the available ros-* debian packages to find which one contains a particular ROS stack or ROS package?  I wanted to install the image_transport_plugins stack, but the wiki page doesn't give me the right info.  (The base ROS Debian packages have been reorganized in Diamondback.)
I don't want to just install all of ROS to make sure I get the one small stack I need.  Is there some index of debian ros package contents I can search through?

A:

Debian package names can be derived from ros-ROSDISTRO-STACK-NAME
Where ROSDISTRO is boxturtle, cturtle, or diamondback
STACK-NAME is the stack name with underscores replaced with dashes.   (ala common_msgs -> common-msgs)
TO find what stack a package is inside of I usually visit the wiki page and look at the header.
