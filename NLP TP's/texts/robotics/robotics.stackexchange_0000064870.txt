Q:

How to set target pose in MoveIt?

Is there any GUI tool to set planning group's start state or goal state in MoveIt? We now can use API and interactive marker to control the arm.

Would the RViz MoveIt plugin work for your use case?

Yeah, that's good,but I want to display the end-effector's pose in real-time in RViz during dragging the interactive marker. Perhaps, MoveIt already has the function, I should learn more about it. Thank you.
