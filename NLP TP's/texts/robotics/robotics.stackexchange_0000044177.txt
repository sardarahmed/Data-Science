Q:

Custom Android App for TurtleBot

Hi guys, I am really new to ROS but currently I am required to learn how to develop a custom Android App for TurtleBot. The thing is, I followed this page and got kinda lost as I have very less exposure on Linux. The commands used in the tutorial and the instructions are kinda new and advanced to me.
My question is, is it possible to develop such Android App for TurtleBot using Eclipse in Windows or Linux environment, though I prefer Windows environment. If so, would someone mind giving me some step-by-step guidance?

A:

I do not maintain the Applications Platform and have not used it myself. So, I can't really help there.
As far as rosjava goes, there are many tutorials for development:
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html
But, there are none for Windows. I do know that there are many Windows developers using rosjava though.
Developing with rosjava on Android is also documented:
http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/android_core/html/index.html
Gradle works on Windows, so the steps should be similar. If you document your steps some place, I'm sure others would appreciate it.
