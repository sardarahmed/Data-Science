Q:

Image_view displays empty gray window

I have not been able to make image_view work. Currently, when I run it a gray screen displays rather than an image.
My first thought is that that I don't have the topic correctly entered. I have tried rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image and rosrun image_view image_view image:=/gscam/image_raw. Both lead to the same result. All of the packages needed are downloaded and compiled.

you can try running rostopic list which will give you a list of current topics. You may be able to tell which topic you want from the list. It might be /camera/image_raw.

A:

Have you checked that the topic is being published (rostopic hz)?
Edit: What nodes other than image_view are you running? From your response, I'd guess that you either forgot to start whatever node you're using to publish camera images, or it's failing. rqt_graph may help you here.

I used rostopic hz /camera/image, which returned the message 'subscribed to [/camera/image]'. I then did rostopic list -p, which returned nothing, as well as rostopic list -s, where /camera/image appeared. It looks like /camera/image is a subscriber and that nothing is being published to the topic.

Most likely, the driver is not contacting the camera successfully, so it has nothing to publish. Check for driver messages in the log.

you guys were right, the camera was not publishing images so that was the problem that had to be fixed. thanks for your help
