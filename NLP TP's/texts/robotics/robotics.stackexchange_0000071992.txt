Q:

How to install perception_oru package from github?

I have tried to install perception_oru package from github. But I had faced problem while approaching the following steps:
$ git clone https://github.com/tstoyanov/perception_oru-release.git
$ cd perception_oru-release
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

Then the following error appears.
CMake Error: The source directory "/home/baban/perception_oru-release" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.

I need to know if there is any cmakelists.txt for this package or how to install this package. This is the prerequisite to create NDT map using NDTfuser.
thank you

try to clone it to your workspace directory that is source on your .\bashrc

A:

The master branch does not contain any code. Try:
git checkout release-source

Also, use catkin_make or catkin build instead of cmake directly, if you are using ROS.
