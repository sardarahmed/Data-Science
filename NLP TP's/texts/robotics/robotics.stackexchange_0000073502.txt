Q:

Standard messages for reporting system metrics

Are there any standard message types or nodes for monitoring and reporting system metrics like memory, cpu and disk usage?
I'm trying to create a simple dashboard, and I'd like to capture and display these, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel. However, I don't see anything relevant in std_msgs or common_msgs.

A:

I typically monitor this type of information through the ROS diagnostics system.
diagnostics_common_diagnostics contains nodes for monitoring disk space, clock sync and a few others.
libsensors_monitor also contains a ROS node for monitoring the sensors available through the kernel sensors API and making that information available through the ROS diagnostics API.
