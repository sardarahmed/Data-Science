Q:

ROS Stream prints spurious characters to log

I launched a node with roslaunch. The node uses ROS_*_STREAM macros to log information. The log file created by the node however shows spurious characters. Following line shows an example
^[[0m[ INFO] [1325453858.376186830]: Alasca scan: time=-0.000000, points=31, nodes=11^[[0m
Every line in the log file starts and ends with "^[[0m". Does anyone know what might cause this behavior. This happens with not just this node, but all nodes that I launch with roslaunch.
ROS: Electric, OS: Ubuntu 11.10 x86

A:

To me they look like escape sequences for colorization.
The 0 should reset all previous color commands.
