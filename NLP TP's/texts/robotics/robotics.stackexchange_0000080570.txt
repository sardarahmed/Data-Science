Q:

Move interactive markers using topics

Hi everyone,
Is there a way to move interactive markers from rviz, but outside rviz? Like publishing in a topic or something like this? I want the interactive marker to follow the hand of the user (published as a tf frame) in specific cases (when they press a button).
Thank you

A:

I don't know about using a TF frame specifically, but you could take a look at the moveit_joystick infrastructure that was added some time ago.

Yes that will work! I will investigate the joystick controller. Here is the file if someone else needs:

It is also included in any recent MoveIt package.
