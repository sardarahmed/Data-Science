Can you tell us why you install yocs_msgs and yocs_velocity_smoother using apt, but then build yocs_joyop from sources?

A:

Sorry I forget detail--later I simply git clone the most update code of ros-kinetic-yocs-msgs from github and do compiling (catkin-make) then it works OK..
Thanks a lot for the feedback anyway.

No, I won't close the question.
Instead I've converted your comment to an answer and accepted it for you.
Note though, as explained in #q322980, you should try to avoid building packages from sources, unless you have a good reason to do it. For released packages, there is no reason to go an hunt for all source repositories and maintaining a Catkin workspace in which you build them. Just use apt-get to install the binary packages.
