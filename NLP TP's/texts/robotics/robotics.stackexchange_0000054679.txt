Q:

c++ api to get message md5sum from string msg type (e.g. std_msgs/Int32)

Is there a c++ equivalent to retrieve the md5sum of a message type from the string msg type?
In python you can do:
import roslib
int32_msg_class = roslib.message.get_message_class('std_msgs/Int32');
int32_msg_md5sum = int32_msg_class._md5sum;

Is there a C++ API for doing the same?

A:

In C++ you can "ask" the message type instead of using an API like in Python.
#include "mypackage/MyMessage.h"
#include "ros/message_traits.h"
std::string md5sum = message_traits::md5sum<MyMessage>();

Since you need to have the message type for that at compile time this won't work when you have the message type as a string only.

Thanks. That is what I thouhgt, just wanted to make sure it wasn't possible to do at runtime without a system call.
