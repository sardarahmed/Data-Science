Q:

How to distribute changes of packages to all involved machines?

Usually we program on a workstation, but our nodes have to run on other machines. For example on a robot or some nodes on a robot and some other nodes on 2 further workstations (because of expensive computations).
To start such a node network, we are able to use launch-files. But which way is the best to distribute changes of packages to all involved machines during the development and testing of code (if the code is stable we could commit it to a SVN repository).
I would like to specify the involved machines (robots, other workstations) in a environment variable and after a rosmake [mypackage] all machines should have the newest code.
Thanks!

A:

Now, I use a bash script with rsync and environment variables. It works fine and also with eclipse(it calls rosmake first, so I use it as build command). If I get a karma>20 I will upload it here.

EDIT:
Here ist the Script: http://www.is.uni-due.de/fileadmin/user_upload/korn/isrosmake
This Script distributes changes of packages to all involved machines. All dependencies of the target package (and including the target package), that are located in $HOME/ros are synchronized (rsync) with the other machines. The target machines are configured by environment variables (e.g. IS_MACHINE1, IS_MACHINE2, ...)(You can use this environment variables in launch files, too).
