Q:

how to install 3rd party ros packages?

Hi there, I'm a beginner of ROS. Normally a ros package from official website includes explanations and instructions on installation and usage. However, when I download a 3rd party package from github (like this one:  https://github.com/RobotnikAutomation/agvs_sim.git), I clone it in \catkin_ws\src\ and catkin_make and always got cmake error telling me that .cmake file was missing. Can anyone tell me how to install it for use? Many thanks!
