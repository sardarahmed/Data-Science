Q:

Executors do not spin correctly when launched separately

Hello,
I would like to build a modular package in which you can model some ROS systems using YAML files.
You can find the github repository here:
https://github.com/HarunTeper/ros_system_model
However, when launching "launch_system.launch.py", the created executors do not spin correctly in their corresponding threads, but are somehow stuck in the spinning process without executing the nodes.
In "src/system_composition.cpp" I try to create a vector of executors and create a separate thread for each that I also save in a vector. While everything is generated correctly, the executors are not spinning correctly.
What do I need to change to get the correct behaviour?

A:

I fixed the issue by saving all created nodes in a separate vector.
