Q:

Error compiling pcl_ros on Fuerte

I am having trouble getting pcl_ros to compile on OSX. I forked rosdistro and created the rosdep for pcl, I also upgraded my XCode to 4.3.2 and installed the command line tools. I also got rid of XCode 4.2 and its command line tools. I get this huge error message when I compile it with the first error shown below:
/opt/ros/fuerte/include/ros/message_traits.h:121:15: error: no member named
  '__s_getMD5Sum' in 'pcl::PointIndices'
return M::__s_getMD5Sum().c_str();

I have tried to fix this but can't figure it out. I think it has something to do with dynamic_reconfigure, but not sure. Take a look at the complete error message linked above and let me know what I am missing.
Thanks

Is this a related issue? http://answers.ros.org/question/11410/error-__s_getmd5sum-is-not-a-member

It may be related, but this is standard ros code (i.e., not mine) that compiles under linux, so I think it should be something simple like adding a boost library. I have already tried adding several to the link process, but nothing helps.

This is broke and doesn't work on OSX
