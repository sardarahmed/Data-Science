Q:

How to create a yaml file to use a predrawn 2d map in a .pgm format to execute on ROS for navigation

Hey. I am trying to use a pre-drawn map made in .pgm format to allow my turtlebot to nagivate through it. I have the .pgm file but do not know how to convert that into YAML as I have only heard from some of my peers that YAML is used in ROS to navigate through a pre-existing known map. Can someone publish the procedure for the same please?

A:

Check out the ROS wiki, there the YAML format of the map_server is documented.
