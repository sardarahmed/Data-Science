Q:

Adding known objects to collision environment problem

Hi!
I'm following the instructions at Adding Known objects to collision environment, but I couldn't find the bellow 2 launch files:
Start up the environment server
roslaunch pr2_arm_navigation_actions environment_server_right_arm.launch
Launch the display for known model markers (This node lets us visualize known model markers):
roslaunch planning_environment display_planner_collision_model.launch
So after I rosrun the add_cylinder in pr2_arm_navigation_tutorial, nothing will show up on rviz. Does anybody have an idea on where I can find the launch files??

Hi Paul,
I've just been wondering the same thing. Are you using ROS electric? It looks like that could be a diamondback tutorial. This looks like the electric equivalent:

Hope that helps!
