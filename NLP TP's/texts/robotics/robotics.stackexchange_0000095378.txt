Q:

How to start Gazebo Simulator with Autoware [closed]

Hello all,
I am following this tutorial  to use Gazebo Simulator with Autoware. A video tutorial has been given which is very very hard to see.
Also it says 'Launch the Autoware Launcher'. Does that say to launch Autoware Runtime Manager??
Is there any alternative documentation for Gazebo Simulator with Autoware?
Please advise! Thank you!

Hi @GeorgNo,
Yes, that's the tutorial I have followed which I also mentioned in my question too. I tried zooming into the video and got something. May I please know if this is the right command to launch Autoware Launcher.
rosrun autoware_launcher main

Please advise! Thank you!
