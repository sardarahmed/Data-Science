Q:

How do I stop these nodes from running

For context, I am working on a simulation for a robot and I am using an external library for pointcloud to laserscan conversion. Everything was originally working fine, but all of a sudden I have these ros2 nodes running which I can't figure out how to kill. I believe they are stopping my TF frames from registering. I have tried using the kill command and trying to find them using "htop", and I have tried finding them in my system monitor, but I can't seem to locate them anywhere to try and shut them down. These are the names of the nodes and the properties:
/vtr/boreas_odometry_feaeexyoeg
/vtr/boreas_odometry_xkzleovjry
/vtr/boreas_odometry_yvjvpzmakr

Where ROS 1 was localhost by default, ROS 2 is everything-on-your-network by default.
Is someone else perhaps also running ROS 2 nodes on your network?
Comment by Mike Scheutzow on 2023-06-07:
If @gvdhoorn's guess is correct, you need to set a unique domain id. This is a DDS config parameter.

Thank you for the responses. It wasn't any of these issues but I appreciate them being addressed. I am new to ROS2 and LINUX so I may have been missing something when trying to find these nodes in system manager, but what fixed it was forcing ROS2 to crash by shutting down python in terminal.
