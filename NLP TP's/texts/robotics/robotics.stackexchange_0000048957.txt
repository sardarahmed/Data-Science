Q:

PCL : computing FPFH at given keypoints

Suppose i have a bunch of keypoints detected by 2D SIFT or SURF and i want to calculate FPFH descriptors at those keypoints. How can i do this?

@kalectro: thank you but I'd like to compute FPFH for single points and not for an entire point cloud. How can i do this?
Comment by kalectro on 2013-03-11:
As for as I know FPFH descriptors need a pointcloud to work with. So do the following:
If you have a bunch of keypoints, just create a new empty point cloud and add the keypoints one by one.

@kalectro. Thank you again. I thought of that but for computing a local descriptor the points around a keypoint should be needed as well. Am i wrong?

You are right, I did not read the tutotial and only assumed it would work like the SHOT descriptor. Try to ask this question on pcl-users.org

Already did that but unfortunately no one has answered (http://www.pcl-users.org/Computing-FPFH-at-given-keypoints-td4026504.html). Thank you anyway.
