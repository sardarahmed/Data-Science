[ WARN] [1516726659.614500547]: /rtabmap/rtabmap: Did not receive data since 5 seconds! Make sure the input topics are published ("$ rostopic hz my_topic") and the timestamps in their header are set. If topics are coming from different computers, make sure the clocks of the computers are synchronized ("ntpdate"). If topics are not published at the same rate, you could increase "queue_size" parameter (current=10).
/rtabmap/rtabmap subscribed to (approx sync):

A:

With zed camera, the depth image topic would be something like this: /camera/depth/depth_registered. You may want to try Zed related instructions on this page.
cheers

@matlabbe i tried it all but i get the same issue
Comment by matlabbe on 2018-01-24:
Try "$ rostopic hz my/topic" on needed topics to know if they are actually published. You can also start only the zed, then do "$ rostopic list" to list all available topics and copy/paste them in your question.
