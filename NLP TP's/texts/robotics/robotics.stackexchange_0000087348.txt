Q:

error: No SCREEN available: You can't launch nodes

I am using node_manager_fkie from multimaster_fkie. And when I run node_manager, this error will appear. When I tried launching a node, this error will appear: usr/bin/screen is missing. Furthermore, on the GUI, "ROS NETWORK [disabled]" is displayed. What am I supposed to do so I am able to run a node?

A:

To solve for the error: No SCREEN available: You can't launch nodes.
You will need to install screen. (sudo apt install screen)
Regarding the network is disabled, it is another problem, I will open another question about it.
All thanks to Alexander Tiderko for replying my email!
