Q:

Error: package 'rqt_plot' not found

Backgrounds:

I am studying this page:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics
in:
Melodic
Ubuntu 18.04

My questions:
When:
$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot
I saw:
[rospack] Error: package 'rqt_plot' not found
Why?
How to slove it?
Note:
I checked in /opt/ros/melodic/share, there are rqt_graph,rqt_gui,rqt_gui_py,nothing about rqt_plot.
Thank you for your kindness and your next answers.
