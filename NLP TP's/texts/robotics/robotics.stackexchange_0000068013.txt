Q:

Record and play BAG file

Hi everyone,
I have a question about an error message.
this tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/slam_gmapping/Tutorials/MappingFromLoggedData
I tried and it worked with the test bag .
but when I tried to play my own bag file appeared the error message
TF_OLD_DATA ignoring data from the past for frame at time .....
where could be the problem , have already searched a lot but have not yet found the right answer .
many thanks

A:

I hope this is your issue, as it's easy to fix: make sure and pay attention to item #4 in that tutorial. Data in bag files often contains timestamps; running without setting the use_sim_time parameter to true often presents TF errors.
