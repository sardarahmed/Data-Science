Q:

subscribe and publish in the same class

I am trying to publish and subscribe to topics from within the same class but cannot figure out how to set up the subscriber callback. Can you explain what to do on line 10 for me? Thanks!

A:

This page describing different callback types (with example usage of each) might help.

sub = n.subscribe("/robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined", 1000,  &Spinner::spin_cb, this); ?

I was able to call the class method from within main but I would still like to figure out how to subscribe from within the class: ros::Subscriber sub = nh.subscribe("my_topic", 1, &Foo::callback, &foo_object);
