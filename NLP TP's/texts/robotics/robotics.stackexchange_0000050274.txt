exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

A:

Your are using a too new version of gazebo with ROS...
What can help:
/<path>/gazebo$ source setup.bash

then run in a terminal:
$ rosrun gazebo gzsdf convert /<path>/your.sdf
