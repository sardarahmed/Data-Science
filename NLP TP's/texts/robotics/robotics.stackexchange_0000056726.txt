Q:

Running a Kinect + Pandaboard and getting RVIZ on a remote

I have installed Ubuntu 13.04(ARMHF) and Hydro on a Pandaboard. I have been unsuccessful with the openni stack - rostopic list  shows one /tf topic and I can't seem to access any of the data within.
The freenect drivers seem better -  I am getting a bunch of topics and I can use imageview on the remote to get both rgb and depth fields.
Where I get stuck is in using rviz.  I don't know what to pick to view to get a simulated scan like on the turtlebot.  I seem to recall something about transforms but I am fuzzy on the details.

A:

I believe you're looking for the depthimage_to_laserscan node.
