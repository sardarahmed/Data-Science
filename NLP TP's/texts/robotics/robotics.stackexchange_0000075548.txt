Q:

install ROS on ubuntu 16.04 with python3

How can I install ROS (kinetic) with python3 support in ubuntu 16.04?
I am following the instructions at http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Source, but replacing python-* with python3-*. There is an issue with installing python3-rosinstaller-generator. The following error is generated:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
python3-rosinstall-generator : Depends: python3-distribute but it is not installable
Depends: python3-argparse but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
Where can I find python3-argparse? As far as I know argparse is part of python3 by default.

Same  issue here.Did you  manage to find a solution

A:

python3-rosinstall-generator doesn't have a dependency declared on pyhon3-argparse: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosinstall_generator/blob/master/stdeb.cfg#L3  I also verified it's not in the dependencies in the repository either: http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/xenial/main/binary-amd64/Packages
Presumably this was resolved since you tried using it. However I don't ever see the dependency there since you asked the question.
