Q:

What are x and y in map_msgs/OccupancyGridUpdate?

I'm trying to do some things with occupancy grids, and I cannot figure what the x and y attributes refer to. Anyone know?
Thanks,
David

A:

Figured it out through testing. X and Y refer to the corner of the occupancy grid update in the occupancy grid frame
