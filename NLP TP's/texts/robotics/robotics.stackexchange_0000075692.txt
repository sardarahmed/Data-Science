A:

There are a number of tutorials on the navigation stack wiki that discuss how to set up the navigation stack.
I would have a look at the RobotSetup tutorial, and proceed as follows:

Set up AMCL, run it, and drive your robot around manually on your map to make sure that it localizes well
(optional) Create the costmap configurations and run the costmap node standalone to make sure that the costmap shows the sensor data that you expect and updates appropriately
Set up move_base with the costmap configuration, global planner configuration and local planner configuration for your robot
Tune move_base so that it drives well
