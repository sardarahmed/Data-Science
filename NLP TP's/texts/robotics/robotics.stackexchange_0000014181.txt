Q:

How can we estimate the likelihood field for a particular scan in probabilistic terms?

I am trying to implement a scan matcher using Scan based sensor model but I cant figure out how to estimate likelihood for a particular scan. Is there any implementation available ? Would be thankful for help

A:

It looks like ROS has a few packages (in rough order of apparent usefulness): 

Scan matcher
laser scan matcher
Local map
crsm-slam
mrpt-localization
amcl
