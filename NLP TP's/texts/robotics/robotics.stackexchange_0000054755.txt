Q:

eigen in groovy for ubuntu 12.04 armhf

Hi,
I'm installing ROS packages on Ubuntu Armhf, and although so far everything went fine, I find a difference with electric. According to http://answers.ros.org/question/10940/eigen-in-ros/, eigen is a system dependency. However, I can't find such package for groovy, except eigen-conversions, eigen-stl*, ecl-eigen*. I installed them, but the installation keeps complaining eigen isn't there. Apart from cross-compiling which I try to avoid, is there any solution ?

Hi skiesel,
Thanks for your response.
I installed libeigen3-dev. Now I used
sudo find /usr -name eigen*
and found that eigen is installed in /usr/include/eigen3/Eigen.
So apparently each installation goes different.
