Q:

No source code cpp file for turtlebot

Hi Everyone,
I have tried to run two turtlebots independently on the same simulation and I just use the model from the tutlebot simulator (hydro) to create two copies using different namespaces, robot1 and robot2. I spawned two and can input velocities independently using the rostopic pub[] command but the problem is that i just got one odom(nav_msgs/Odometry) topic no separate by namespace. Some people posted the solution for this problem by changing the "gazebo_ros_create.cpp" file. I searched for this file in my PC but I couldn't find it. Please can somebody tell where I can find this source file in my PC?
I am using Hydro version with turtlebot simulator files.
Thanks alot

A:

If you installed ros with apt-get, you will only have binary packages and no source code. You will have to create your own catkin workspace and include the source. It is in the create_gazebo_plugins package. To find the source the following command can help, which outouts rosinstall syntax that can be merge into a workspace with wstool.
roslocate info create_gazebo_plugins --distro hydro

Demmeln, I installed turtlebot from source using:

cd ~/turtlebot
wstool init src https://raw.github.com/turtlebot.. rosinstall -j8
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
catkin_make
I made some changes but i don't know how to recompile using catkin_make help
