A:

For anyone interested in participating in the GNOME Outreach Program for
Women (OPW) on an OSRF project (ROS, Gazebo, etc), please contact
opw at osrfoundation.org and we will give further instruction.
More information on OPW in general can be found at: http://gnome.org/opw/
OSRF has a page on our wiki with information about projects and application criteria:
http://wiki.osrfoundation.org/opw14 Also feel free to suggest a project of your own.
