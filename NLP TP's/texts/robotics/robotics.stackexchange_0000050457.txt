Q:

Subscribe to new JointState messages

Hello,
I'm new in ROS and have a problem making the joint_state_publisher publish JointState messages on a topic different from /joint_states.
I wanted to publish arbitrary joint states from the terminal window and therefore I intended to use the source list parameter in my launch file as proposed here in the joint_state_publisher Package Summary.
But I cannot make it work by adding the parameter to my .launch file. I tried something like
\param name="source_list" value="joint_states_test" type="str"/>
What do I have to do in order to make it work?
Thanks,
Mike

I have the same problem. But i think quest must be edited to change the beggining of the question in order to make clear. what is intended is to use the imput option for joint_state_publiser to take messages from an arbitrari topic and republish them in /joint_states. Title is not veri descriptive

A:

Now is an old thread. But i answer anyway for the next noob like that could end up here.
To pass list parameters to a nodes you should use the tag 'rosparam' instead of
'param'. You could see how to use it here.
On my launch file the joint_state_publisher looks like that:
<node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher">
    <rosparam param="source_list">["my_controller/robot/joint_states"]</rosparam>
</node>

It worked and I'm now visualizing on rviz my real robol state. Note that you could put whatever you want instead of my_controller/robot/joint_states.

And if you want to test this, try something like:
rostopic pub my_controller/robot/joint_states sensor_msgs/JointState '{header: {seq: 0, stamp: {secs: 0, nsecs: 0}, frame_id: ""}, name: ["the_urdf_joint_name"], position: [1.0], velocity: [0.0], effort: [0.0]}' --once

from where you get joint state for a real robot?
