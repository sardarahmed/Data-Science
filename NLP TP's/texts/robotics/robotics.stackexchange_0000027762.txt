Q:

How to disable gravity only for a specific model in Gazebo?

A similar question has been answered. http://answers.ros.org/question/65991/how-to-disable-gravity-of-a-model-in-the-world-only-disable-one-model/
However, this only works for the .sdf model files. It does not work for urdf. Kindly help.
<link name="base_link" gravity="0 0 0">
    <gravity>0</gravity>
  </link>

  <joint name="base_joint" type="fixed">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
    <parent link="base_link" />
    <child link="body_link" />
  </joint>

  <link name="body_link">
    <gravity>0</gravity>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="0.1" />
      <origin xyz="0 0 0" />
      <inertia ixx="1" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="1" iyz="0" izz="1" />
    </inertial>

    <visual name="base_visual">
      <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
      <geometry name="pioneer_geom">
        <mesh filename="package://rotors_description/meshes/simple_airplane1.dae" />
      </geometry>
    </visual>

    <collision>
      <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
      <geometry>
        <mesh filename="package://rotors_description/meshes/simple_airplane1.dae" />
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    
  </link>

A:

It looks like your file is in the URDF format (you use origin instead of pose for example).
<gravity> within a link is specified in SDF, but not in URDF. Luckily, the conversion from URDF to SDF is possible. In order to use SDF tags within your URDF link, use the <gazebo> tag, as explained in this tutorial. It should look something like this:
  <gazebo reference="base_link">
    <gravity>0</gravity>
  </gazebo>

Thanks a lot! It works. :-)
Comment by hbaqueiro on 2018-11-05:
Does it remain static in the world even if something collide with it? I was looking for something more like the  tag.
Comment by chapulina on 2018-11-05:
No, it will not remain static, it will just not be affected by gravity. There's no way to set only one link to be static, that tag works only on the model level. You can however make a model static and connect it to a non-static model with a joint.

For me the  tags did not work, this did work however:
<gazebo reference="base_link">
   <turnGravityOff>true</turnGravityOff>
</gazebo>

For me  or  can not stop model to drop down to the ground,
in order to ensure model in the air, I fixed it in the world link
  <link name="world"/>

<parent link="world"/>

<child link="link1"/>

  </joint>

I tried both  and   but none of them turned gravity off. When I check the generated sdf file it shows that there are two tags defining gravity. Adding the tag in Urdf file doesn't overwrite the default value. it just adds another tag.
<gravity>0</gravity>
<gravity>1</gravity>

Does anyone know how i can overwrite the original tag?

Hi val,
have you found a solution for this problem by now? I assume I am facing the same issue.
Comment by danzimmerman on 2021-02-17:
Yep I'm hitting this now too (ROS Melodic + Gazebo9)
Related to https://github.com/osrf/sdformat/issues/71 ?
Comment by danzimmerman on 2021-02-17:
@th123 <turnGravityOff>1</turnGravityOff> (case-sensitive) is working for me in ROS Melodic. <turngravityoff> all-lowercase doesn't work.
