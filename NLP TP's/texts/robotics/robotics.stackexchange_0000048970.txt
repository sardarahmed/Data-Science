Q:

Smoothly watching through TurtleBot Kinect camera

It seems that the visualization tools such as rviz take a lot of computational resources. Actually I just want to watch through the Kinect camera (see what TurtleBot sees) but I don't need other fancy 3d simulation stuff. Is there any simple, high performance package that can do this? Thank you very much.

A:

If you only want to see the camera image, use image_view, e.g.:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image
