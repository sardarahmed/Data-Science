Q:

mocap_optitrack rigid body starting orientation

Is there any way to ensure the starting orientation of a rigid body is the same every time when configuring the rigid body for tracking?  Can the markers be configured so they match a world coordinated system?
Thank you in advance.

A:

From my experiences with my motion capture setup, there is no solution for this.  The trackable must be created coincident with frame of the motion capture system.
