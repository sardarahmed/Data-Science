Q:

what are the different communication methods available?

Im not talking about services etc. I mean what communication methods could be used between a laptop running ROS and a robot running ROS?
i mean the actual data transfer medium..wifi? Zigbee? bluetooth? ethernet? UWB?
has anyone played around with different ways to do communication?

A:

It is everything possible aslong you can tunnel TCP-Communication. For communication within in the robot(one Roscore) I prefer Ethernet, to connect the services. For commication between a Command&Controll and the Robot I Use Wifi (and an ligtwith UDP protokol), if longdistance communication is neccery, I would use Zigbee and Rosserial and Bluetooh is nice way to connect a Remotecontroll with Real-Visual feedback.

thank you  for your input. Thats helpful. Do you know of any scientific paper that says so? it seems there are no papers targeting the communication between the "Command&Control" and the robot..any ideas?

If I want to use Bluetooth as the underlying medium of communication between different ROS nodes which controls various parts of the robot, how would I implement it.  I understand that ROS works on TCP. So I should enable Bluetooth profile which is capable of supporting TCP. PPP? any suggestions?

I you can Chose, you can configure Bluetooth PAN, and you have an TCP/Connection
