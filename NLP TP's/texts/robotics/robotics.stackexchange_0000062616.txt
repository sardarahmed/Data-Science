Q:

How to interpret camera.yml of object_recognition_transparent_object?

Hi all,
I want to use transparent_object to estimate the pose of my object. And the sample program needs camera.yml as input.
%YAML:1.0
camera:
   K: !!opencv-matrix
      rows: 3
      cols: 3
      dt: d
      data: [ 525., 0., 3.2050000000000000e+02, 0., 525.,
          2.4050000000000000e+02, 0., 0., 1. ]
   D: !!opencv-matrix
      rows: 5
      cols: 1
      dt: f
      data: [ 0., 0., 0., 0., 0. ]
   width: 640 
   height: 480 
   pose:
      rvec: !!opencv-matrix
         rows: 3
         cols: 1
         dt: d
         data: [ 0., 0., 0. ]
      tvec: !!opencv-matrix
         rows: 3
         cols: 1
         dt: d
         data: [ 0., 0., 0. ]

I've found that this file is for camera calibration,
http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/tutorials/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.html
http://maztories.blogspot.tw/2013/07/camera-calibration-with-opencv.html
I don't know the relationship between this file and PR2. If I want to use PR2's kinect to get image, do I need to adjust the content of this file? How do I adjust it?
Thanks in advance.

A:

OK, the K matrix is the intrinsic matrix. D is the distortion coefficients. And this is not related to PR2's tf.

If I want to modify this file, I can use camera_calibration to get results and use camera calibration parser to transform the format.
