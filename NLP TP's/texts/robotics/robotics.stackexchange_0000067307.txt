Q:

husky openni_tracker

Hi,
I'm new in ROS and I want to make husky follow a person.
I searched information about how to do it but I haven't found anything.
Does anyone know how to do it?
Thanks.
I'm working with Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS hydro version.

it should be easy. get the openni tracker file and get z value for a specific joint. Then implement feedback control loop
