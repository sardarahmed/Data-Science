Q:

base motion planner with OMPL

Hi there,
I wanted to create motion plans for my robot base (and not for an arm) using OMPL (more specifically RRT). I have found the ompl_planner_base package, but I get an error from svn:
https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/sandbox/ompl_planner_base' doesn't exist

Is there any tweak to use the arm_navigation stack to provide plans for a robot base (ideally integrated with the navigation stack)?
thanks

according to https://code.ros.org/trac/wg-ros-pkg/changeset/50709 the repository has changed to https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_dturtle/sandbox/ompl_planner_base/ I will update the wiki

Thanks. Actually it is exactly what I wanted, but the repository from ompl_planner_base is not working: "404 not found"
