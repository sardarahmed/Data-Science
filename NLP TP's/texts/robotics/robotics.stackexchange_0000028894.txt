Q:

Conversion of URDF to SDF source code

I have noticed that while converting robot description from URDF to SDF file, some parameters are lost, even though they are set in accordance with the documentation. I was looking through the Gazebo source code but can't find the file where the conversion from URDF to SDF happens. Can you point me to it?

Found it in the sdformat package at src/parser_urdf.cc.
