Q:

How can I run ros-indigo-husky-desktop on Jade?

Hi all,
I have installed ROS Jade on Ubuntu, and I faced the problem on this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/husky_control/Tutorials/Interfacing%20with%20Husky .
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-husky-desktop

command works fine, but
$ roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch

generates the following problem:
[view_robot.launch] is neither a launch file in package [husky_viz] nor is [husky_viz] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I would be grateful for your help.
Best!

A:

You cannot install packages under Indigo and then try to use them in Jade. Those are two separate ROS distributions.
You'll have to ask the maintainers of the ros-indigo-husky-* packages to release them into Jade, or try to build them from source in a catkin workspace.

I'll ping the maintainer.  Is there a reason for using Jade?
