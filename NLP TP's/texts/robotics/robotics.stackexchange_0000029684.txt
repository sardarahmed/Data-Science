Q:

How can UAVs be simulated using ROS?

I was wondering what approach (if at all) people are using for simulating UAVs using ROS. For example, it should be possible to simulate quadrotors using gazebo. Has anybody already tried this? Are there any other working solutions interfacing other simulators?

A:

It might help to know what capabilities you are looking for in a simulator. Kinematics, dynamics, sensor models, validation, real-time vs. non-real-time, graphics, multi-vehicle ...?
The flyer_sim package in starmac-ros-pkg has a very basic simulator implemented as a node written in Python. At present there is a simple nonlinear dynamics and sensor model that is not meant to exactly simulate a particular quadrotor, but rather to simply have 'quadrotor-like' dynamics so that the rest of the system can safely be tested (and learned). In the near future we expect to have more accurate models based on system identification implemented in the flyer_sim package.
While not strictly speaking part of the simulator, the overall package also has a means of visualizing the simulation in rviz (see the end of this tutorial for a screenshot).

I'd use simulation for the complete package e.g. more towards high level control (path planning, sensors, navigation etc.) with plausible, if not perfect dynamics of the simulated vehicle. But I really asked the question out of interest what other people are doing / what is possible.
