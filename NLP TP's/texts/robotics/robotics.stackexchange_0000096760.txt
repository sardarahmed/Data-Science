Q:

Multiple kinematics solver for the manipulator

Hi all,
below you can find my kinematics.yaml file. Since my robot only has 5 DoF and the IK solver has sometimes has probelms with finding solutions. So the position_only_ik parameter is set to true.
However, the ik-solver should at least try to find a solution according to the given 4D cartesian parameters (x,y,z,pitch). So I am wondering if I could use multiple kinematics solver or change the position_only_ik value online so that I can tell the robot: Use solver 1 with position_only_ik:false and if you failed use solver 2 with position_only_ik:true.

robot_arm:
kinematics_solver:
trac_ik_kinematics_plugin/TRAC_IKKinematicsPlugin

kinematics_solver_search_resolution:
0.05
kinematics_solver_timeout: 0.005
position_only_ik: true

No, this is currently not supported by MoveIt.
A workaround could be to implement an IK solver yourself which realises this behaviour (ie: uses multiple IK solvers internally itself).
That way MoveIt would only see a single solver, but you'd still achieve the behaviour you describe.

change the position_only_ik value online

Afaik position_only_ik is not a dynamic_reconfigure parameter, so this would also not be supported.
It would be easy to check though: just start MoveIt, start rqt_reconfigure and see whether that parameter is there.
