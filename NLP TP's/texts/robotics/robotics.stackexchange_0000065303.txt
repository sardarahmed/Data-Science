Q:

libuvc_cam : issue about running the driver

I have follow the instructions in libuvc_camera, run the launch file as
<node pkg="libuvc_camera" type="camera_node" name="usb_cam">
<!-- Parameters used to find the camera -->
<param name="vendor" value="0x199e"/>
<param name="product" value="0x8302"/>
<param name="serial" value="3"/>
<!-- If the above parameters aren't unique, choose the first match: -->
<param name="index" value="0"/>
<!-- Image size and type -->
<param name="width" value="640"/>
<param name="height" value="480"/>
<!-- choose whichever uncompressed format the camera supports: -->
<param name="video_mode" value="uncompressed"/> 
<param name="frame_rate" value="60"/>
<param name="timestamp_method" value="start"/>
<param name="camera_info_url" value="file:///.../*.yaml"/>
<param name="auto_exposure" value="1"/> <!-- use aperture_priority auto exposure -->
<param name="auto_white_balance" value="false"/>
</node>

the terminal came out the following information at last few lines :
unsupported descriptor subtype: 13
uvc_get_stream_ctrl_format_size: Invalid mode (-51)
and
process has died
Does any body could provide any clue to solve this issue? Thank you very much.

A:

That definitely seems like an error related to the settings at the bottom of your launch file. If the height, width, frame_rate, video_mode, etc. that you specify are not supported by your webcam, then the camera_node will crash with the error you pasted.
As mentioned in the documentation you linked, you should run the v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext command to determine the acceptable values for each of those parameters. If adjusting the parameters doesn't fix the issue, please post the output of this command. Note that you may need to use --device along with v4l2-ctl to specify which camera to provide parameters for. For more help run v4l2-ctl --help

I'm having the same error using an Intel RealSense R200 camera. Here's my launch file, output, and v4l2-ctl output for the video streams: http://pastebin.com/K3V8ZKL6. Any tips/help are appreciated!
