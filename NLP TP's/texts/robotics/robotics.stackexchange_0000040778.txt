Core i7 - 8 GB RAM -  graphics with 1GB separate memory. with my experience with ROS and memory specs its " The more the Merrier"

A:

I would go for the solution with more cores. As ROS is distributed over multiple binaries it naturally scales well with the number of cores.
Also go for 8GB RAM instead of 4GB. It's probably not too expensive, but multiple binaries do in turn each allocate memory.
