Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Car dynamics

I am currently in a formula student team and I am really interested in learning more about the car's dynamics (eg how to simulate the car movement inside gazebo). It would be great if I could get resources to learn more about this (and also if possible, a "learning path") as I am a bit struggling with knowing where to start.

A:

A lot of open-sourced material from the TUM winners of Indy Autonomous Challenge are in repositories mentioned in this ROS Discourse post.
There is also this post with a really nice intermediate introduction to an intermediate-level course from the Autoware Foundation for individuals who develop pre-production autonomous driving systems.
There is this SVL SIMULATOR Unity-based multi-robot simulator for autonomous vehicle developers from LG Electronics America R&D Lab too (repository).
This post is nice too: https://www.theconstructsim.com/start-self-driving-cars-using-ros/.
