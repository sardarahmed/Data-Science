Q:

How to get the position of tf frame

How to get the position of the tf frame (child frame in rviz) , when I use tf.TransformListener().lookupTransform(parent_link, child_link, rospy.Time()) I get the relative position and relative orientation and not position and orientation, how to get the position and orientation using python script?

A:

All positions are measured relative to some reference frame. I believe that the rviz display is showing the position compared to your configured 'world' frame setting. And the position relative to the parent.
If you call lookupTransform(parent_link, child_link, Time(0)) You're explicitly asking for the transform between parent and child.
You wan to use lookupTransform(world_frame, child_link, TIme(0)) to get the latest transform from the world frame to the child link which I think is what you're considering non-relative position. You have to pick your reference to be able to do that.
