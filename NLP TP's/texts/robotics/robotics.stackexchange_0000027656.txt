Q:

Continuously updating Pose of a link in a plugin

Hi,
I need to continuously update the pose of a link, in the OnUpdate function.
What function from the API can I use for it?

A:

You could use Link::SetWorldPose for example, but note that this will override the physics engine, so things like gravity will be neglected.

Is there any way, by which gravity cannot be neglected?
Comment by chapulina on 2016-03-01:
If you set the pose to be 10m above ground for example, that will move the object regardless of other forces in the world. If you apply force instead, the resulting position will be a combination of all the forces applied. To reach a specific position by applying force, you'll probably need something like a PID controller.
