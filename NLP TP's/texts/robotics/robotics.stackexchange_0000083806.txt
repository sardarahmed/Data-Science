Q:

Suggestions for drone simulator with ROS + Gazebo

Hi there, I am looking for a decent starting point for a drone project. I've checked the TUM_SIM (http://wiki.ros.org/tum_simulator)
And it seems quite stable, nevertheless, anyone has some experience with drones and ROS? What do you recommend? And also for the motion planning, should moveit work for a task like this? Or should I look into other 3d planners?
Thanks for the tips!

It's a little hard to give suggestions without any knowing what you're looking for.

Sorry if I was being a bit to vague, I am looking for a good simulator package to integrate with gazebo (like the tum_sim) in which I can simulate an environment, control my drone and plan movement.I know gazebo is powerful enough but I don't want to start from scratch, so far the tum_sim looks good

A:

my experience with drones is connected with the use of the gazebo simulator in conjunction with the mavros.
MAVROS - MAVLINK - PX4
another one Microsoft AirSim, but i didn't use it.
