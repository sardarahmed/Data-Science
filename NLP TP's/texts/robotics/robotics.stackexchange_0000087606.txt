Q:

Memory allocator for ROS2 messages?

RCL has allocators to have custom memory management, that are taken from rcutils. Tests while doing my Ada binding show that this works nicely. I'm now trying to understand where a message allocator is configured. For example, in the rosidl-generated bool__functions.h there is:
bool std_msgs__msg__Bool__Array__init(std_msgs__msg__Bool__Array * array, size_t size);
and in general any array message is dynamically allocated (I think). I'm trying to ascertain what I should add to my binding to also provide allocators for messages. Thanks for any pointers.

Answering to myself, it is under evaluation: https://github.com/ros2/rosidl/issues/306

Yeah definitely an issue with eventual consistency, the rosidl stuff is just older and hasn't been updated just yet.
