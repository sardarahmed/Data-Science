Q:

How to turn off all collisions?

I am using Gazebo 2.2.3 under ROS Indigo.  I am wondering how I can turn off collision on all models (or even one at a time) without turning off the physics.  I need the sensor data from the physics but I also want the models to pass through each other if they come into contact.
Thanks!

A:

You can try using the <collide_without_contact> tag. Here's a nice example world.
You could also look at collide bitmasks, in case you still want some models to collide with each other.
(by the way, Gazebo 2 is not supported anymore, it's recommended you move to Gazebo 7)

Thanks!  That did the trick.  And yeah, I've run Gazebo 7 on some of my Ubuntu 14.04 machines and ROS Indigo but 2.2.3 is running fine for what I need right now.
