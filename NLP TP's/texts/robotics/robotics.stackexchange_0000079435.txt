Q:

Cannot communicate/ping the turtlesim

I am going through the tutorials and have reached point of using the turtlesim for learning about nodes, etc. I am trying to ping the turtlesim node, but there is no communication with the turtlesim. I have it running and roscore from 2 separate terminals and am pinging it from a third. Pinging the rosout node does work.
Here is the rosnode info for turtlesim:

A:

well after doing some research, I found out that my ROS_IP was not set correctly.  So, I followed the instructions here  and set my ROS_IP to 127.0.0.1 using:
export ROS_IP=127.0.0.1
Hope this helps someone else.
