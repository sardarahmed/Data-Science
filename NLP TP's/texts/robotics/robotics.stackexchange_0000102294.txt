Q:

RpLidar A1 arduino

Hi guys, I'm trying to connect RpLidar into Arduino Portenta H7 Lite and get the data into Robot Operating System. I trying to use to rplidar_arduino package to read data from lidar and next I'm using rosserial to pass data into ROS, but unfortunately I don't know how to pass it. Have anyone tried to do it?
