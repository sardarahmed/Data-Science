Q:

ImportError: No module named gazebo_msgs.msg

Hi,
Having installed and using the gazebo simulator environment for a while now I was wondering why when I try to import from a related package I get an error.
...
from geometry_msgs.msg import Pose,Twist #works fine
from gazebo_msgs.msg import ModelState
...
ImportError: No module named gazebo_msgs.msg
Looking through folders there doesn’t seem to be a difference between geometry_msgs and gazebo_msgs files/structure.
I want to then subscribe to the listed topic
rostopic list:
...
/gazebo/model_states
...
Then:
self.subModelState = rospy.Subscriber("/gazebo/model_states",ModelState,self.DroneState)
Cheers,
EMP

A:

Which ROS distro are you using?
On Hydro and later, this works for me:
import rospy
from gazebo_msgs.msg import ModelState

On Fuerte, you need to import roslib, like this:
import rospy
import roslib
roslib.load_manifest('my_pkg')
from gazebo_msgs.msg import ModelState

And before you do that, you have to make sure that in my_pkg/manifest.xml, you have the line:
<depend package="gazebo_msgs"/>

Of course, in any distro you also need to have gazebo_msgs installed and on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH; you can check by running roscd gazebo_msgs.

Thanks,
I forgot about the package dependencies:
I added  and it worked obviously.
Thanks again
