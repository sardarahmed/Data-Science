Q:

what is the simplest method of extracting a 2D map file from the scenario?

I am working on USARSim/ROS control framework. I have been able to move robot using keyboard through ROS package. Now I want to generate a global map in 2D of the USARSim environment where the robot is moving.
What is the prerequisite for map_saver utility to generate a 2D map?
Can anyone please help me regarding this.

Hi Bill, thanks for your quick reply.
I have gone through the tutorial. But unable to extract the map from laser data stored in rosbag. Again to get full map of the environment  do I need to  drive the robot around the environment continuously?

I think, if I use a correct bag file, then also the map_saver utility must give us the map.pgm.
rosbag play basic_localization_stage.bag
rosrun map_server map_saver

I have noticed that no messages are published in the /lms200 topic. Moreover I have realized that the corresponding /tf node does not exist. I suspect it's another bug in USARSim/ROS but I haven't investigated further.

kr1zz Hi, how you came to know that no messages are published in the /lms200 topic, can you specify the filename in usarsim_inf package where modification has to be done? By the way USARSim/ROS modified something take a look. http://sourceforge.net/p/usarsimros/code/ci/master/tree/usarsim_inf/.
I have posted another question here http://answers.ros.org/question/94671/error-in-creating-2d-global-map-of-the-environment/
