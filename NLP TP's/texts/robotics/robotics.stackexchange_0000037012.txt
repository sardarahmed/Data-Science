Q:

Accessing the household_object_database remotely from willowgarage - server down?

Hi,
I was trying to use the household_object_database remotely from willow garage using tutorial
and got the error
ERROR: Unable to communicate with service [/objects_database_node/get_model_list], address [rosrpc://grasp.willowgarage.com:15432]

rather than the below one mentioned in the tutorial.
ERROR: Unable to communicate with service [/objects_database_node/get_model_description], address [rosrpc://grasp.willowgarage.com:15432]

Is it because of the server down issues or am i missing something here.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

The "Is it up?" site says grasp.willowgarage.com is down right now.
That is a good way to check on things like this.

I suppose you can wait until it's back up, then make your own local copy.

So how do i solve this? Am i supposed to wait for someone to restart the server or stop using this package?
