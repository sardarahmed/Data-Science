Q:

TurtleBot "move_base/goal" Problem

Publishing a MoveBaseActionGoal.msg on the move_base/goal topic sometimes fails. Sometimes, though the goal appears on "rostopic echo move_base/goal", the TurtleBot will not move.
Can anyone resolve the issue?

A:

Normally, you should not send MoveBaseActionGoal messages directly. Instead, use actionlib. Have a look at this tutorial.
In your case, unless you can provide more information, I think it is hard to say what the actual problem is. Does rxconsole show something? My guess is that you don't fill in some information actionlib relies on correctly. Using actionlib instead of constructing the goal by hand would prevent that.
