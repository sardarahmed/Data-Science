Q:

Issues with Stageros

Hello,
I'm trying to work with stage (again). Brings back memories... Anyway, I don't know why it's not working. Maybe the syntax has changed a little... Either way, this is what I get when I tried this tutorial:
allenh1@muri-pc7:~$ rosrun stage stageros `rospack find stage_controllers`/world/roomba-wander.world
 [Loading /home/allenh1/ros/stage_controllers/world/roomba-wander.world][Image "bitmaps/roomba-stage.png"]
err: Model type laser not found in model typetable (/tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-stage-1.6.6/debian/ros-fuerte-stage/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/stage/build/stage/libstage/world.cc CreateModel)
err: Unknown model type laser in world file. (/tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-stage-1.6.6/debian/ros-fuerte-stage/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/stage/build/stage/libstage/world.cc CreateModel)

I'm just copy/pasting the command from the tutorial, so I assume it should work...
Thanks in advance,
-Hunter A.
