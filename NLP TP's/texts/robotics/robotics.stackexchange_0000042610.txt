Q:

kinect depth value

I know that each pixel in the depth image is supposed to relate to the distance
of that part of the scene, but no unit ( not [mm] ).
How do we translate from these value to a distance measurement in some kind of
useful units like [mm]?
Can you tell me the changable fomula?

A:

The openni_camera wiki page describes how to interpret the data from each topic published by the camera. Specifically:
depth/image_raw (sensor_msgs/Image)
    Raw image from device. Contains uint16 depths in mm.
