Q:

model with different friction

I am trying to create an SDF object in gazebo that has different surface friction values at different points to
test how controller respond to the ground changing. Is it possible to do this using SDF?

Have you done a search at https://answers.gazebosim.org ?

A:

I haven't tried this, but I would look at creating multiple rectangular models, each having different friction properties, then position instances of these models so they form a continuous surface. If you make the z-dimension very short, you could even place them on top of a standard ground plane (so there's no edge-of-world for your robot to fall off of.)
Follow-up thought: I assume you are aware that gazebo's ODE friction calculations are very crude. Don't be surprised if your simulation results seem quite unrealistic.
