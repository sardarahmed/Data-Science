Q:

robot description in turtlebot

Hi,
I am trying to push everithing related to my robot under the name of the robot, but when it comes to the topic robot_description I can't, the description keeps the original tree for the transform and does not go under the tf_prefix or the ns that I give. Actually the parameter goes under the ns as the new parameter is turtelbot2/robot_description.

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/eb98b1032146dec8e278d00ef714924c

as you can se the names of the parts of the robot are not turtlebot2/base_link is just base_link.
Is there any chance to push them under a parameter similar to tf_prefix?
Thanks!

A:

I don't think there is another way than creating two different robot descriptions to prefix the link names. I'm not sure if that's necessary though. The robot_state_publisher accepts the tf_prefix parameter and will prefix the links with it when it publishes the TF tree. As long as all your turtlebots are identical, you can use one robot_description parameter and several robot_state_publishers with different tf_prefix parameters. If you put robot_description into a namespace, you need to set the parameter robot_description of the robot_state_publisher as well.
