Q:

Groovy generator error!

The desktop and desktop-full generators,
http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop
http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop-full
both return errors when I try to access them. In the web browser I get a long debug page with an HTTP Error 404, and running wstool init -j8 src <generator url> from the command line as part of the install install process gives an HTTP Error 500;

ERROR in config: Is not a local file, nor able to download as a URL [http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop-full]: HTTP Error 500: INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

What's going on here? I'm pretty sure this just started happening. Is there a workaround? Can we fix this ASAP please?

I sent an email about this to ros-users a little while ago.

@Dan Lazewatsky: Good stuff. Unfortunately I need it to get fixed before I can continue with testing really...
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-27:
I wonder if there are caches anywhere for the meanwhile...
Comment by Dan Lazewatsky on 2013-02-27:
You should be able to point wstool to a local rosinstall. If you're following the wiki instructions exactly, it'll be at ~/ros_catkin_ws/src/.rosinstall.

Thanks. I'll give that a go!

@Dan Lazewatsky: Unfortunately it seems to generate a LOT of errors: http://pastie.org/pastes/6351471/text -- I wonder if this is independent.
Comment by Dan Lazewatsky on 2013-02-27:
I'm surprised you didn't come up against that before. There's a question on here somewhere that I can't find with a solution. Basically, just go into the src dir, and do rm -rf tf2*, and you should be able to continue.
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-27:
@Dan Lazewatsky: There's also errors processing catkin, roslib, opencv, and others if you notice. Are these normal too? They weren't for me when I first did it: https://gist.github.com/alexreg/4965426 -- It was me that posted that question in fact, then you posted a duplicate and I redirected you :)
Comment by Dan Lazewatsky on 2013-02-27:
Those look like they're all tf2 related. You should be able to get rid of tf2* from your src dir and continue on with the install. I think despite the errors, it will still download everything else you need.
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-27:
Well see the last few lines of http://pastie.org/pastes/6351471/text -- surely the catkin/roslib ones are nothing to do with tf2?? I didn't get those previously, as you can see.
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-27:
Odd. I just ran again and only the opencv2 and tf2 ones remain now. Oh well. What do you get?
Comment by Noldorin on 2013-02-27:
@Dan Lazewatsky: No luck trying to change the compiler. Either cmake ignores it, or goes into an infinite loop... sigh. Why did the developers choose to use something as convoluted and messy as cmake.

A:

The 404 errors should be fixed.  There seems to be an issue with reliably querying github for backend information.  If you get errors like:
Failed to read package.xml file from url 'https://raw.github.com/ros-gbp/vision_opencv-release/release/groovy/cv_bridge/1.10.6-0/package.xml'

Please just try again.  We'll work on becoming more robust with caching in the future.

Thanks. That's good to know.

Glad to help.  Please accept the answer using the checkmark so others don't try to answer it for you as well.

Oh, I already did. Seems it didn't register though. Darn AJAX stuff playing up. :)
Comment by William on 2013-03-01:
I just added a better error message now too, so you don't get a traceback. The wstool will still get 500 errors if it fails though.
