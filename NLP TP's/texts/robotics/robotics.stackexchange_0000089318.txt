Q:

ROS2 Python Migration Guide

Is there a ROS2 Python Migration Guide? My initial web searches  only found this page which seems old and doesn't really say how to migrate.

Isn't the info part of the general Migration guide?
Hm, that's rather barren when it comes to Python actually. nm.

A:

Unfortunately I don't think there's anything other than the examples to compare against ROS 1 to see the differences.
There's this in the migration guide about using just a setup.py in your python package (rather than CMake):
https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Migration-Guide#pure-python-package
But that's all I'm aware of.
Here's some of the examples:
