Q:

CMake has not found a package configuration file provided by "console_bridge"

I am attempting to install Ros Indigo from source on Ubuntu 15.01
After running the following command I am getting the following error message. What should I do?
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

==> Processing catkin package: 'cpp_common'
==> Building with env: '/home/josephcrandall/Documents/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh'

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findconsole_bridge.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "console_bridge", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "console_bridge"
  with any of the following names:

    console_bridgeConfig.cmake
    console_bridge-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "console_bridge" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "console_bridge_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "console_bridge" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

Thanks Akif, As per that page you pointed i did try to install ros-groovy-console-bridge but ubuntu returns "Unable to locate package". I also tried building it as per the instructions but my "make install" did not create a share/ folder. Only Install and console_bridge and still i get the same errr

@jayvenki , seems like you have indigo release. Therefore you should install ros-indigo-console-bridge . Not the groovy version.

@jayvenki Don't know why this is an accepted answer. It seems to me like you forgot to install libconsole-bridge-dev as it says in the http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
