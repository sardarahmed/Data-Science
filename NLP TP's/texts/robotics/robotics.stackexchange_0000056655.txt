Q:

Install ROS on CentOS 6

Hello.
I'd like to install ROS on our department HPC cluster.
The cluster OS is CentOS 6.4.
$ uname -rms
Linux 2.6.32-358.el6.x86_64 x86_64

$ cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS release 6.4 (Final)

Could anybody please tell me

what packages (source or binaries) to download

the install procedure

Thank you and best regards.
Robi

Also, it is very likely many people did not see this question due to the tags you used, I'll try to improve my tag filter, as I don't know what other tags you would have put in.

A:

As the others have said, this page has everything you need:
http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source
You will have to find the CentOS equivalents to the things in the first paragraph. @Dirk Thomas just updated the above page with instructions about how to install the prerequisites on non-Ubuntu OS's.
I understand your want for the links to the tarballs, but some of these prerequisites are not published by us (Make, CMake, compiler, etc...) and the others are distributed as build tools, if you want their sources, you can simply treat them as normal Python packages. That means installed via pip, the instructions for this are now in the wiki page, and the sources obtainable from pypi.python.org, e.g. rosdep is installed with [sudo] pip install rosdep and the source can be located here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rosdep
Once you have moved pass the prerequisites then comes the source code for the ROS packages and the instructions on the above wiki page tell you exactly how to get the source code via tarballs.
Since the ROS ecosystem is very large (hundreds of packages) we provide the rosinstall_generator tool to figure out what tar balls you need. For example, to get all of the source for roscpp, this command would be used:
% rosinstall_generator --deps --tar --rosdistro hydro roscpp

The output is YAML which can be used with our wstool in order to fetch all of the tar balls for you. After than you can do what ever you need with the source, but I recommend you follow the above wiki once you get past the prerequisites I think you will find it pretty generic.
EDIT: Also, ignore the <a...> tags in the YAML above, that is a rendering bug with askbot... Ticketed for a long time here: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/answers.ros.org/issues/55
