Q:

Can i charge a lipo nano tech battery over imax b3 charger

Can i charge a lipo nano tech battery over imax b3 charger. 2650mah 35/70c 3s is the battery

A:

Disclaimer: I have never actually used the B3 so trust this only 90% ;)
The iMax B3 is specifically marketed towards 2/3 cell Lipo Batteries and reviews suggest it works ok, so the B3 should be fine to use. As I mentioned in the comments, it can only supply 0.7A for 3 cells, so a 2.65Ah battery is going to take a very long time to charge.  Can the B3 damage the battery?  As long as you dont get faulty hardware (which is true for all chargers), and the fact you certainty won't have overcharging problems, it'll be completely safe.  
I suggest investing in the iMax B6 as you can charge at a much faster rate and those will last you a decent amount of time (I've had mine for 2 years no problem)
