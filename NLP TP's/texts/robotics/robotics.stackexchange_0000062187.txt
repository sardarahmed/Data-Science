Q:

How to display 2D probabilistic map in rviz?

I have a probability grid that I use as a map in my application.
How can I display this in rviz? Does the rviz map plugin supports probability values or only the states unknown, occupied and free?
Is there any other option on how can I show this map in an user friendly way?
I found this question here Rviz display 2d probabilistic map, but, since it's from February 2012, I wanted to get a more updated answer on this topic.

A:

RViz can show nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid messages both as grayscale or with a color scheme. I think this is exactly what you need, given you can convert your probabilities to a 0..255 range.
