Q:

cameracalibrator.py error

I am trying to follow the ROS tutorial titled: "How to Calibrate a Monocular Camera", link I am using the gscam driver and have verified that it is publishing correctly. Also steps 1.1-1.3 executed without error, but at step 1.4 when I enter:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/camera/image_raw camera:=/camera

I get:
('Waiting for service', '/camera/set_camera_info', '...')
Service not found

(display:17709): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: cannot register existing fundamental type 'gchar' (as 'gchar')
**
GLib-GObject:ERROR:/build/buildd/glib2.0-2.40.0/./gobject/gvaluetypes.c:455:_g_value_types_init: assertion failed: (type == G_TYPE_CHAR)
Aborted (core dumped)

If I run it with the "--no-service-check" option, I get:
Exception in thread Thread-4:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 810, in __bootstrap_inner

    super(MonoCalibrator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

Killed

If it helps below is the output of "rostopic list"
/camera/camera_info
/camera/image_raw
/camera/image_raw/compressed
/camera/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/camera/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates

/camera/image_raw/theora
/camera/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/camera/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates
/rosout
/rosout_agg

Any help would be appreciated, I'm running this on Indigo, Ubuntu 14.04

I suspect the /camera/set_camera_info service doesn't exist, or isn't remapped properly. Can you add the output of rosservice list to your question please?

A:

The service /set_camera_info mentioned in your edit needs to be remapped to /camera/set_camera_info .
