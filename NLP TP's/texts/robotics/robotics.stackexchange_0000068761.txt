Q:

Setting up ROS catkin/rosbuild simultaneously

I have both a catkin_ws and a rosbuild_ws. However, when I use the command roscd I can only go to the one I've sourced last, i.e.:
-When I do source ~/rosbuild_ws/setup.bash, I the packages inside rosbuild are known, hence I can roscd to them.
-When I do ". ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash", the packages inside catkin are known. But I stop being able to roscd into rosbuild.
This also means that rosbuild cannot use catkin packages and vice versa.
What can I do?

A:

Check out this Tutorial on having a rosbuild workspace on top of a catkin workspace.
However, note the drawback:

You cannot depend from a rosbuild package on a catkin package.

Thus, it would be worthwhile to switch to catkin for all packages.
