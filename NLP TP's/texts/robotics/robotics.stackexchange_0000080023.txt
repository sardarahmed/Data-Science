Q:

How Can I simulate a driverless Car using ROS and gazebo

I completely new to ROS and Gazebo and now I was asked by my professor to use these two programs to simulate a car that will avoid obstacles and lane shift from the left most lane to the right most lane on a high way automatically without a driver but i don't know how to start although i finished most of the ROS and gazebo packages

A:

https://github.com/osrf/car_demo as @kentam said could be what you want.
