Q:

Where is the binary of a ROS package node

After installing ROS, I can use "rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key". Where can I find the binary corresponding to the node turtle_teleop_key?

A:

For turtlesim specifically: see #q214020.
In general: see #q209051 and in short: in the lib/ sub dir of the devel or install spaces (/opt/ros/$distro is essentially an install space).
