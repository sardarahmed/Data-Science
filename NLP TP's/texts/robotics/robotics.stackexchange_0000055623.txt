Q:

pre-release tests on buildfarm

Hi all,
I just went over the tutorials for pre-release tests on the website:
http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/PrereleaseTest
It refers to the possibility of running pre-release tests on the buildfarm, i.e. non-locally. However, the link pointing to the buildfarm's pre-release page is broken:
"Then go to buildfarm's pre-release web site:
wiki.ros.org/prerelease.ros.org "
Is this feature deprecated? If yes, oh no! Is this feature not available, yet?  If yes, I can't wait. If the feature is around, where can I find the page of the buildfarm's pre-release site? A quick google search did not help me... Thanks already.
Cheers,
Georg.
