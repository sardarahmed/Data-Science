Q:

Help understanding the notation used on ar-drone tutorial

Hi everyone, for the tutorial link:text, under

Sending Commands to AR-Drone

It shows three highlighted commands which are: ardrone/takeoff ardrone/land and ardrone/reset. These are topics so is the full commands actually: rostopic /ardrone/takeoff rostopic /ardrone/land androstopic /ardrone/reset ?
Also, to fly the drone after takeoff, would I do something like: rostopic cmd_vel -linear.x to move the drone backwards?
I am trying to understand how to read the commands listed, sorry that this is basic.

Hi,
If you want to send a message from terminal you should use the command like:
rostopic pub /ardrone/land std_msgs/Empty

For /cmd_vel you should use the command like:
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  '{linear:  {x: 0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}'

Brilliant! One thing that I would have not known from the tutorial is std_msgs/ Is this used to say 'I am going to send an empty message' ?

Just to check, for the section https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy#cameras am I correct to say the commands to get a stream of the front and bottom cameras are:
$ rostopic pub ardrone/front/image_raw image_transport and 
$ rostopic pub ardrone/bottom/image_raw image_transport
?

Hi. Do you want to toggle camera?
Comment by JP on 2013-08-19:
hi, nope I would like to display the front facing camera on my computer screen if possible.

You need to use image_view package. Like this "rosrun image_view image_view image:=/ardrone/image_raw"
