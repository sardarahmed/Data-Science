Q:

SICK laser driver fails to start after initialization and handshake?

Dear all,
I am getting trying to connect SICK LMS200 to ROS, but get the following error after it finds the port, and the laser info.
kris@IanCurtis:~/ros/$ rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms

It seems odd, that the driver says it found the sick at 38.4k. I don't know this driver, but maybe you have to configure the serial port manually by setserial /dev/ttyUSB0 baud_base 500000 uart 16654. I don't know if that works for USB or helps at all.

Yes, I have it working with a custom Java drivers @ 500K in 180 deg, with 1 deg resolution

Do you know if the scanner if working hardware-wise. Have you run another driver that works?

Did you figure it out? I'm getting the same error.
