Q:

installing XV-11 driver git error

I'm following the directions from here,
http://www.ros.org/wiki/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node
I installed Cturtle and then when I try to install the driver I get this.
linux$ rosinstall ~/cwru-ros-pkg /opt/ros/cturtle 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=cwru-ros-pkg.rosinstall'
rosinstall operating on /home/ringo/cwru-ros-pkg from specifications in rosinstall files  /opt/ros/cturtle, http://www.ros.org/wiki/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=cwru-ros-pkg.rosinstall
processing config_uri /opt/ros/cturtle
ERROR: woah, unknown installation method git not installed, cannot create a git vcs client
So do I need to install GIT or is there another way?
