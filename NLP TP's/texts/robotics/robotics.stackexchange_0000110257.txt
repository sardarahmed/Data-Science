Q:

Separate your tf tree to have crucial frames update at a high frequency

I'm calculating inverse kinematics for a low latency system but my robot's tf tree is so large, the time it takes to update the whole tf tree affects the calculation time significantly for my application. Is there an implementation or feature to have just the frames I need to calculate IK to have a priority in the tree and update and a much higher rate? Would this idea even be effective?
Maybe creating a mini tf tree with just the frames I need to calculate IK, then feed that info into the original tf tree? Maybe do something with namespacing to have another tf topic? For example: /mini/tf.
Do I just need a stronger computer?
I'm looking for some inspiration or for anyone to point me in a direction. Thanks.

A:

tf2_server is the solution for ROS 1. It has several modes of working. In one, you can set a list of transforms of interest (or whole subtrees) and it will start publishing just the subtree on a namespaced tf topic. On the client side, you just remap /tf to the namespaced topic and you're done.
Search for the "streams" functionality in the readme.
Don't hesitate to ask for details if you face any problems using the package.
