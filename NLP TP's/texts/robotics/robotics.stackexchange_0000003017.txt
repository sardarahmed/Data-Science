Q:

Programming language?

In general, what is a good programming language for robotics? I am a starting robo nerd and don't know anyone who would know things like this.

A:

The short answer is, frustratingly, "it depends".
Nearly every established language can be used to program one robot platform or another. In my short career as a roboticist I have already used Python, Java and C++ to program different robots. There are even tools to program the Lego NXT in Ada, would you believe that? So whatever programming language you already know, there's a good chance you can use just that: Google robot <language name> and see what turns up.
That said, if you have no previous programming language knowledge, C and C++ are probably the safest bets out there. Most robotics platforms support either one of them (or can be coaxed into support without too much effort), and there are plenty of useful packages available. As a bonus, C / C++ were highly influential to languages that came after them, so it would give you a head start on many a language you might want to learn later.
