Q:

I use collision element in my code but still the robot links crush each other. Why?

I have made a 15 DOF robot and add collision element to avoid internal collisions, but anyway the links collide within each other. I use RViz to visualise the robot.

Can you able to provide more details? please, If possible upload an image to support questions.

What are the steps you have followed till now?

A:

You misunderstand what the collision element is for: it is used by algorithms for detecting collision, but these elements do not directly prevent it. Only some API calls will check for collision and stop the movement. It's your responsibility (or that of the code you chose to run) to not send joint-movement commands that cause collision.
