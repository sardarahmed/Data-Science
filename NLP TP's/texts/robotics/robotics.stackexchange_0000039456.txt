Q:

kinect camera with 32-bit ubuntu

Hi
Can kinect camera be connected to ubuntu 32-bit for RGBDSLAM package? I'm using ubuntu 11.10 32-bit os. Its dual boot along with windows7 64-bit. I installed with 32-bit ubuntu cd accidently and working on it. I wanted to confirm before buying kinect, can i use the openni driver for kinect and perform rgbdslam or should i change to 64-bit ubuntu 11.10?

A:

Yes, Kinect works perfectly with rgbdslam. I tested it with ROS Electric from binary package. Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10, 32-bit.
