it didnt work  @Alexandr Buyval
john@john-K53SD:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/bin$ ./gzsdf print /home/john/ros/01-myfirstyo.urdf
bash: ./gzsdf: (the file or the  directory doesnt exist)
Maybe it happens because I am using ros fuerte. What do you think?

it's broken in fuerte, please ticket.  Conversion works in groovy.  Here's another way to source setup in groovy:
source rospack find gazebo/scripts/setup.sh
then, you can run:
gzsdf print [your urdf file]

Hello.
You can use the following command:
$GAZEBO_PATH/Gazebo/Bin: ./gzsdf print your_urdf_file.urdf

and copy result to sdf-file.
I used this method in Groovy.

It seems I have used the version 1.3. But I don't sure that it is important. Which version of ROS have you used? What is your error?

@Alexandr Buyval I tried in both fuerte and groovy. The errors were: XML Element[turnGravityOff], child of element[link] not defined in SDF; Error reading element ,,. But, after modifying the tags according to the new sdf format manually I could convert the urdf to sdf. thanks

In newer versions of gazebo, the correct tool is now a flag on the gz executable: gz sdf -p my_urdf.urdf > my_sdf.sdf
