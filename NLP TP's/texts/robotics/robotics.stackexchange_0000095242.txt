After installation  melodic in ubuntu 18.04 for first time,i input "roscore" in ubuntu terminal command port, i see as follows:
Command 'roscore' not found, but can be installed with:

A:

Did you remember to first source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash before trying to run roscore?

Edit:

sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full

There isn't roscore in /home/my name/opt/ros/melodic/bin, does it mean i didn't install successfully?
http://wiki.ros.org/cn/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu

I would not expect it to be located in $HOME, but in opt/ros/melodic/bin.
What is the output of ls -al /opt/ros/melodic/bin/roscore? Do not change the path, just run that command.
Assuming you ran ls -al /opt/ros/melodic/bin/roscore and it tells you there is no such file or directory, it would seem for some reason you're missing the roscore binary.
You could try reinstalling it using:
sudo apt install --reinstall ros-melodic-roslaunch

Pay close attention to the output of apt. Perhaps it tells you why it can't / couldn't install the roslaunch package successfully.

Must I reinstall ROS melodic?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-03-31:
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Please tell us which command exactly you've used to install ROS (and where you found that command).
Then also tell us the output of ls -al /opt/ros/melodic/bin/roscore

Why havn't roscore file? I see there is rosrun file.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-03-31:
I'm not going to respond until you tell me the output of ls -al /opt/ros/melodic/bin/roscore.
Comment by Dean on 2020-03-31:
ls: 无法访问'/opt/ros/melodic/bin/roscore': 没有那个文件或目录
It means : can't visit '/opt/ros/melodic/bin/roscore':there isn't that file or directory.

Thank you for lots.By your method:sudo apt install --reinstall ros-melodic-roslaunch,roscore does work.I can see the little cute tortoise and control it with arrow button.
