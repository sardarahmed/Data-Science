Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: run the rviz

Each time I run the rviz  "rosrun rviz rviz" I have to "export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1".
And if I open a new windows, I have to export it again.
I want to know how should I do if just set it once,and next time I run rviz,I can not set it.
Thank you very much.

A:

If you want an environment variable (like LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE) to be set automatically every time you open a new terminal, add it to the bash startup file (.bashrc) in your home directory.
