Q:

Why turtlebot's SLAM failed to connect kinect devices?

I followed turtlebot_navigationTutorials/Build a map with SLAM.
I run
  roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch 
  roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch
  rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot_navigation`/nav_rviz.vcg

My picture

1.Why gmapping_demo.launch show the following errors?

2.How to build a map on RViz?
Thank you~

A:

I believe the tutorial you are using is for running turtlebot in real world applications. So when you run Gmapping it is trying to access a real kinect sensor and if you have not connected one to your machine it will not be able to run gmapping. Or maybe its due to this problem http://answers.ros.org/question/12869/building-a-map-with-slam-using-turtlebot-in-gazebo/.. Hope this helps..

For building a map in simulation you want to follow this tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Map%20in%20TurtleBot%20Simulator
