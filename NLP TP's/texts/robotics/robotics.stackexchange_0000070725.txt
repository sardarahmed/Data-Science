Q:

about talker.cpp and listener.cpp : Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

Hi , i want to test 11. Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++) , i installed indigo, and i have a workspace with catkin i have called catkin_ws1 with a package beginner2_tutorials , and now i make 2 files with name talker.cpp and listener.cpp in path : catkin_ws1/src/beginner2_tutorials/src and then change CMakeList.txt in path catkin_ws1/beginner2_tutorials  and then i write $ catkin_make but at the end i receive Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed , and because of this i think when i write $ rosrun beginner_tutorials talker , i receive this answer :
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/fatima/catkin_ws1/src/beginner2_tutorials

so please help me whether i have done this thing true ( for talker and listener.cpp) and
what should i do  for the errors?

A:

You should run catkin_make in root of your workspace (i.e, /home/fatima/catkin_ws1/)
Also can you provide your workspace directory tree and contents of your CMakeList.txt file?
UPDATE
@fatima, as this part tells;
add_message_files() directory not found:
      /home/fatima/catkin_ws1/src/beginner2_tutorials/msg

it seems like you do not have msg directory in beginner2_tutorials. You possibly skipped this tutorial. You can check it for custom messages etc.
