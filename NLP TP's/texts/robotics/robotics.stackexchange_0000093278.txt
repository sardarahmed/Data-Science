Q:

Is it possible to subscribe the same topic twice?

Hi, i'm working on ROS kinetic with Ubuntu 16.04.
I just wonder whether I can subscribe same topic by two or more Subscribers.
For example, once i run turtlebot bringup pkg, many other topics should be published.
In this situation, can i subscribe the same Odom topic at node_A and node_B simultaneously??
Thanks in advance. :)

A:

Yes.
Multiple nodes can subscribe to the same topic.
Multiple nodes can publish to the same topic.
I believe that each subscriber gets it's own buffer so there is no worry that one subscriber will get one message and the other subscriber will miss it - and if I'm wrong about that, I'm sure someone will be along shortly to correct me.
