Q:

how to fix the map drifting in rviz?

I've run the hokuyo laser and microstrain imu with my regular PC and try to map out but the drifting come along when turning, or object close to the laser which make the map miserable.....
Here is the trail .bagfile of hector slam

Is there anyone know that how to fix the problem?
(Thanks for your helping )

A:

The combination of a relatively low update rate (10 Hz) and range (4m) Hokuyo URG-04LX LIDAR and an environment that at times does not provide many features in a scan makes your scenario a difficult one. You could try if a laser_scan_matcher/gmapping combination fares better for this one.

Is it possible to use the combination of a laser_scan_matcher and gmapping for UAV flight SLAM? (for a better mapping) Because I would like to implement it on UAV...the above bag file is the handhold mapping though (thanks for helping)

Yes it is possible, however this approach also does not work all the time. A example with a comparison between both approaches for a quadrotor application can be seen here: http://answers.ros.org/question/35684/icp-scan-matching-failure/
