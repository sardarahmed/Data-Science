A:

#1 is likely a bug in QT 4.8.1, what version of QT is installed on your system?
#2 is not really a problem itself, but if you want it to go away, set $ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE to the path of an actual config file, explained here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosconsole#Configuration
That being said, if $ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE is not set, it looks like you might be redefining $ROS_ROOT, which by default in fuerte is set to "/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros" and not "/opt/ros/fuerte/ros".
