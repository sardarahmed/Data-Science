Q:

how to compile package with debug option

I'm not sure if this is newbie cmake question or rosbuild question, but is there way to compile package with debugging option as -g, -pg? (I found  make VERBOSE=1 can generate more verbose output message, so look for something like make DEBUG=1 option.)

A:

In your CMakeLists.txt define this near the top:
set(ROS_BUILD_TYPE Debug)

True, but note that the question was originally asked with the rosbuild tag, and answered in 2012.
