Q:

Failed to find rosdep libglui-dev for package view_mesh on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric

Hi ,
I am new to ros. I am trying to compile bosch_surface_reconstruction package on my UBUNTU 11.10 system. I installed ros-electric on my system as mentioned on the wiki page.
I dowloaded complete bosch repository in one of my folders and I added that folder path to ros stack path. When I run "rosmake --rosdep-install" in bosch_surface_reconstruction directory I get following error :

Failed to find rosdep libglui-dev for package view_mesh on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
Failed to find rosdep libdevil-dev for package view_mesh on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
Failed to find rosdep libann for package view_mesh on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
Failed to find rosdep libglew-dev for package view_mesh on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric

How can I fix this error?..I could not install these packages with rosedep --install command, as it gives error that it could not find these packages.
Any help would be really appreciated.
Thanks
Avanindra

Hi Avanindra, I am still working on the proper releases for various Ubuntu version. Will come back to you as soon as that is done. D.

A:

This means that the rule which defines libglew-dev does not cover ubuntu:oneiric.  You need to find which stack's rosdep.yaml defines libglew-dev and add rules for ubuntu oneiric.
