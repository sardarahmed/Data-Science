Q:

How do I use a subscriber callback to change a global variable?

I'm trying to use a callback for the current location to update a global variable I have that's just a tuple. However, the callback is working fine, but the global variable is never updated.
I normally use a callback as a loop to run whatever it is I want to do, but in this case I have a separate loop choosing locations to navigate too. I want this loop to gain access to the current location.
Also, I'm not sure I understand exactly how callbacks work, and this may be me problem.

Ok cool. I'm also new to Python, so that could explain my problem as well. Thanks.

Also, while we're here, is there a good thread/site for understanding callbacks? I think I get them now, but it took me a while as it was new and at first seemed like magic....

@IFORbot: sounds to me like you should start a new question.

A:

If you're in python, take a look at the "global" keyword. If you're in C++, we're going to need a code snippet.
