Q:

rosdep install fails on yaml-cpp

I'm following the ROS Indigo Install Guide
I'm currently on this command in a virtual environment:
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

Which displays the following:
executing command [sudo -H pip install -U nose]
Password:
Collecting nose
  Using cached nose-1.3.7-py2-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: nose
Successfully installed nose-1.3.7
executing command [brew install yaml-cpp-0.3]
Warning: ros/deps/yaml-cpp-0.3-0.3.0 already installed, it's just not linked
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  homebrew: Failed to detect successful installation of [yaml-cpp-0.3]

I've been able to fix this before with $ brew install --overwrite [package-name] but I just get the same message as above:
$ brew install --overwrite yaml-cpp-0.3
Warning: ros/deps/yaml-cpp-0.3-0.3.0 already installed, it's just not linked

I tried overwriting libyaml and yaml-cpp as well with no resolve.
What should I try next?

A:

You need to link yaml-cpp-0.3, as the warning suggests. You can do so with:
$ brew link yaml-cpp-0.3
