Q:

Does stereo_proc undistort images?

I have tried to use the image_pipeline stereo_image_proc to get the rectified images.
The question is, when stereo_image_proc produces image_rect images, should they be undistorted? Have a look at my screenshot:

I have given the distortion matrix to the topic and I have tried to undistort the images myself and quite happy with it.

Yes, it is written here. Quote :

stereo_image_proc performs the duties of image_proc for both cameras, undistorting and colorizing the raw images. Note that for properly calibrated stereo cameras, undistortion is actually combined with rectification, transforming the images so that their scanlines line up for fast stereo processing.
