Q:

turtlesim cannot work

Hi, everyone,
I am new in ROS, and i am following the manual on ros.org.
I hanv just successfully installed turtlesim package, but i can not find the turtlesim_node. I download one but it does work. It says:
/opt/ros/electric/ros/turtlesim/turtlesim_node: error while loading shared libraries: librosstack.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Can anyone tell me what the preblem is ? Hope to receive your help. Thanks a lot.

Hi Kevin,
Sorry if you've already done this, but let's start with the basics. Please confirm that you have set up your bash environment correctly. Can you echo your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and confirm it is correct?
Check this link http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment.
If anything there is not working, go back a step and confirm that you've done everything at this page correctly http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu
