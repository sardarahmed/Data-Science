Q:

rviz does not show 3d objects from urdf

Hallo.
I try to follow the tutorial
urdf Tutorials/ Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch
The Problem what I have is that the 3d Objects are not visible. I can only see the arrows of the x/y/z axis at the joints which are moving when I change the values for the joint angle in the Gui of the joint_state_publisher.
I use melodic and I got the files directly from the Github repository.
I started with:
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=src/urdf_tutorial/urdf/06-flexible.urdf
It seems to be a general issue, because I got the same problem with other downloaded urdf-examples and all urdf files of this tutorial.
Visual in the RobotModel is in the preferences enabled and when I set TF prefix to false, the arrays of the coordinates in the origin of the not visible objects are also not visible.

A:

You're probably running into something similar to #q272692. For now that still requires a work-around, until the fixes applied to the affected packages have been propagated upstream (they're in Ubuntu/Debian).
