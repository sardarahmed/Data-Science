Q:

Frame's definition (/odom and /map)

Hi, I cannot understand the difference between the frame "/odom" and "/map".
I've already read here -> http://ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html#map
however, I couldn't understand.
It seems like the same frame.
Could you explain the difference?
And one more thing.
When I published a transform from "/map" to "/base_link" and launched rviz,
"/map" was shown in a strange position(very far from base_link's origin).
If possible, I'd like to set the position and orientation to a Grid Marker's corner.
How is the position defined?
I don't need to mind it?
Thanks in advance.

A:

The /odom frame is the place where your robot is initialized, while the /map frame is the origin of your map. Those are usually NOT the same (except your robot is standing at the exact origin of your map when beeing initialized).
