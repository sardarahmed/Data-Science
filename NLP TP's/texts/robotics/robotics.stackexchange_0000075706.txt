Q:

What is the purpose of `exec "$@"` in ros_entrypoint.sh?

Looking at the Dockerfiles here: https://github.com/osrf/docker_images/tree/master/ros/indigo/indigo-ros-core, what is the purpose of exec "$@", i.e., the last line in ros_entrypoint.sh ?

A:

exec "$@" causes the shell to exec the arguments that were passed in.
In this case, the ENTRYPOINT script is setting up the ROS environment and then executing the command that you gave it.
The docker documentation for ENTRYPOINT goes into more detail about what ENTRYPOINT files are and how they work.
