Q:

Sending multiple goals to Navigation Stack

I am writing a program for autonomous navigation of a Husky. I combining imu, wheel encoders and visual odometry for navigation. All the sensors have been successfully integrated and a target goal can be sent to the robot. Here is my question:
How can I send the robot multiple goals so that it will visit each goal and do not stop at each one?  Right now,  I am using the ac.waitForResult() function, (based on the "Sending Goals to the Navigation Stack" tutorial). The robot will stop at each goal and then move to the next one. I want the robot to move smoothly.

A:

Part of the problem may be from looping for 5.0 seconds and waiting for 1.0 second in the callback Usually, you want your callbacks to execute quickly and six seconds is not quick. I also notice that you're instantiating the action client in your callback too.
You should probably make a class and have the callback manipulate the class attributes. That way, you don't have to have the waiting and instantiation in your callback.
