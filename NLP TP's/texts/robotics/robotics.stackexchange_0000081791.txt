Q:

Anybody know what might be causing my laser readings to behave like this? [video]

https://youtu.be/vQJC-mlnRKY
In the video I move the robot, and the laser readings seem to move along with the robot, when in fact they should be more stationary.
I then increase the delay on the /scan topic, and I get a really thick wall, in the direction in which the robot is moving.
Any idea what might cause it?
It seems that algorithms like gmapping are producing a pretty decent map.
I did a tf view_frame, and the tf's are all publishing at about 5hz, the robot is defined in a urdf.
Thank you in advance!
Here is the tf_view file, the laser scan comes from veldyne:

Could you post the view_frames.py output?

Ive updated the original post with the view frames output

A:

It looks like your odometry is scaled incorrectly; notice how the laser scans move, but only about half as far as the robot moves.

The issue was indeed the odometry was scaled exactly how you said, by half of what  the robot moves at.
I had changed the motor controlled/ encoders and did not update the code to properly reflect this.
Thank you
