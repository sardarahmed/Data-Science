Q:

Change of path planners

Hi, I'm new to ROS, and I'm having trouble changing the default path planner to some other on my project. The project currently uses the navfn planner, but I was looking to use DWA planner (or other you may suggest). How I'll be able to change that?

A:

Note that navfn is a global planner, i.e. it computes that path from a start point to an end point, whereas dwa_local_planner is a local planner (as the name suggests) , which is used to avoid obstacles while following a pre-planned (from the global planner) path.
Thus, you cannot substitute one with the other.
Alternatives would be (amongst others):

for navfn: global_planner
for dwa_local_planner: TrajectoryPlannerROS, teb_local_planner and others.

You can change them by replacing the respective base_global_planner and base_local_planner parameters of move_base to the respective planner plugin name.

Edit
About what plan are you talking now? Global or local?
Anyways, the answer is the same. Choose your appropriate planner algorithm and implement that as the respective LocalPlanner/GlobalPlanner plugin to move_base. There is a tutorial about how to do this for a global planner on the wiki.
You can also have a look on other planners how they are implemented.

I'm sorry, when I was writing the question I forgot to mention that. I'm using the setup of navfn and TrajectoryPlannerROS. I wanted to use some kind of genetic algorithm to make the path plan, but I'm having trouble with that, so I thought about changing the current one to any other setup.

Could you by any chance give me a hint of how I could make use of a ga to create the plan?
