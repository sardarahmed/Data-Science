Q:

roscpp error listener.cpp and talker.cpp

The same talker and listener works perfectly with a python file and why it fails to work with a cpp file.
rosrun ros_basic_tutorials talker.cpp 

Error

A:

you can't run a .cpp file.
The command should be
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker 

assuming you completed the section 3 Building your nodes of the WritingPublisherSubscriber(c++) tutorial
