Q:

Unable to connect Groovy-raspbian with arduino Mega ADK & Leonardo

Good afternoon partner I'm trying to follow the example Hello World in Rosserial/tutorials but I'being given the same with the two Arduino:

[ERROR] [WallTime: 1390504719.732367] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

I have looked for fixing it but I don't find something that could help me.
Anyone could help me please?

We work with some many differents raspberry. This one has been set up a few days ago , less than a week.  Following as always the tutorial. Problems with new versions maybe?  Thanks for your interest

Thanks you for your interest. i´m telling you tomorrow. We´re trying it in the student´s raspberry. If not, we´ll start from the beginning again.
EDIT: Remaking ros_lib was a solution for us in this case. Thanks you so much

A:

Try remaking your ros_lib.
