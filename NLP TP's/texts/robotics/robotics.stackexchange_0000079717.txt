Q:

Is ROS Kinect Broken?

I am trying to follow this tutorial to begin playing with the ROS: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
but when I do:
rosClient@rosclient-VirtualBox: -$ sudo rosdep init
I get the error:
sudo: rosdep: command not found
maybe am missing something, but do you have any idea what it is??

Could you please tell us which steps you already completed, and what the output was? It looks like you just haven't installed rosdep.

A:

Have you tried installing rosdep? Depending on your system the process will vary, check out this link:
