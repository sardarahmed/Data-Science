Q:

Tried to publish before configured topic id 125

Hi
I am using rosserial arduino, from the tutorial link text I made my custom message file which contains string and integer data types in catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg/Datatype.msg  and converted it into a header file  Datatype.h, After that I ran following commandrosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py . It created header datatype.h in /sketchbook/libraries/roslib/beginner_tutorials. Now I am able to compile my header file . But while running serial_node.py I am getting following errors:
pankaj@pankaj-HP-Pavilion-dv4-Notebook-PC:~$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0`[INFO] [WallTime: 1461149079.336082] ROS Serial Python Node

[ERROR] [WallTime: 1461149083.266678] Tried to publish before configured, topic id 125

Other examples of arduino like Hello world  are working fine. I am getting error only when I use my custom message header.`Why am I getting this error ? please help.

A:

Can serial_node.py access the msg definition?
Looks like you haven't run message generation through catkin for your custom message package.
Or you haven't added devel/install space into your path.

Hey Vmato thanks a lot. I was forgetting to add install path. It worked now.
