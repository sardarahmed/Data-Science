Q:

rtabmap: g2o, GTSAM

why do I need them?
I have installed rtabmap-ros as ROS package. Have I already running g2o and GTSAM?

A:

From this paper (section 3.5):

When a loop closure or a proximity
detection are detected or some nodes
are retrieved or transferred because
of memory management, a graph
optimization approach is applied to
minimize errors in the map.  RTAB-Map
integrates three graph optimization
approaches:  TORO [Grisetti et al.,
2010], g2o [Kummerle et al.,2011] and
GTSAM [Dellaert, 2012].  g2o and GTSAM
converge faster than TORO, but are
less robust to multi-session mapping
when multiple independent graphes have
to be merged together.  TORO is also
less sensitive to poorly estimated
odometry covariance.  However, for
single map, based on empirical data,
g2o and GTSAM optimization quality is
better than TORO, particularly for
6DoF maps.  GTSAM is slightly more
robust to multi-session than g2o, and
thus is the strategy now used by
default in RTAB-Map contrarily to our
previous works using TORO.

g2o may be already used if you installed rtabmap-ros from binaries (apt-get). To verify if g2o and GTSAM are supported in your current build, do:
$ rtabmap --version
