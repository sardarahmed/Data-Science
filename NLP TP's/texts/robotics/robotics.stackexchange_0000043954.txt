Q:

IK succeed for constraint-aware but fail for non-aware

i'm following this tutorial http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_kinematics/Tutorials/Tutorial%204 to do the inverse kinematics for my robot arm. but for the same goal position, the constraint_aware_ik succeed to find a solution while the non constraint aware ik cannot. after dig into the source code, i find that the constraint_aware_ik ultimately call the function searchPositionIK() and the non-aware ik call the getPositionIK(). my kinematics solver is the KDLArmKinematicsPlugin. is there anybody encountering the same problem as me?

A:

Probably what's happening is that the IK solver is unable to evolve from the seed state you provide to the desired goal. The searchPositionIK() method performs retries (up to 3 by default) from randomly sampled seed states if the provided one fails, while getPositionIK() does not.
If you want to keep using getPositionIK(), choose a more appropriate IK seed state.

thanks for the answer. i  will try other seed states
