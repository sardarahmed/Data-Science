Q:

How can I revise the velocity that ROS set for robot navigation

Hello, everyone.
I am fresh to use ROS.
I am now able to control a mobile robot with teleop, and have already built a room-environment map by using gmapping.
After that, I tried to make the robot to perform a navigation task.
I first pressed "pose estimation" of rviz'GUI and then pointed an approximate pose for the robot in rviz's map.
Then pressed "Nav Goal", and followed by telling robot a position to go.
And the problem occurs, the robot began moving and sometimes it just tremble while moving on the way to the goal position.
Someone suggested that it might be due to the velocity that ROS configured.
So, how i can revise it or do something else.
Thanks.
