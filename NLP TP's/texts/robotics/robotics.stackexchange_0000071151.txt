Q:

PYTHONPATH is not set correctly by source devel/setup.bash

I am having some issues with the PYTHONPATH that is set by my ROS environment.
my .bashrc contains the following lines:
source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash
source /home/x/workspace/devel/setup.bash

If I print my PYTHONPATH in a new bash it looks like this:
PYTHONPATH=/home/x/workspace/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

The PYTHONPATH contains only workspace-specific packages.
This results in failure, when trying to import the catkin package from a python interpreter (as it is for example required when importing a rosnode project in qtcreator)
I investigated this problem a little bit, and it seems as if the first sourcing command sets the
PYTHONPATH=/opt/ros/jade/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

(which is where the catkin package is found)
The second sourcing command however resets the path, and only appends the workspace specific part again.
Is this the intended behavior?

A:

I don't really know what the problem was, I removed the whole workspace and set it up again.
It seems to work now
