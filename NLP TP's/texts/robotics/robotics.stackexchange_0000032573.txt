Q:

Inverse kinematics solver

Hi, all,
I need to select an IK solver for a 5dof manipulator.
I took a look at the IK solver in ROS. There seems  at least two IK solvers. One is KDL which use extensively in arm_kinematics and pr2_arm_kinematics package. The other is Openrave (orrosplanning). Another one is OMPL motion planner,  which I'm not sure whether it has a built in IK solver or it just call the IK service from KDL.
Since we have a rather simple manipulator (5dof), it should have an analytical solution. I would like to get an analytical solution from the IK solver mentioned above. I know Openrave will give the analytic solution, but how about KDL? Does KDL only have the numerical solution? And how about OMPL, which kind of solution it use, analytic or numerical? Thanks.

A:

OpenRave is the only package I know of that will generate analytic solutions for a generic arm.  arm_kinematics uses the kdl numeric solver, and ompl doesn't contain any kinematics solvers - it just uses whatever plugins you have configured for your system.

Thank you for your answer. This clear my thoughts.

@egiljones is openrave compatible with older versions of ROS like ROS hydro?
