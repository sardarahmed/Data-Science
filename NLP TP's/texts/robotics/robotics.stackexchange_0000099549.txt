Q:

Does Localization has nothing to do with the range of laser?

Hello, I'm working with ROS kinetic in Ubuntu 16.04.
I just made a map following the g-mapping, with Hokuyo's LiDAR of UBG-04LX-F01.
And I wonder if the angle ranges when making the map can be different from those when real driving.
Do the angle ranges have nothing to do with localization itself?
Would there be no problem if the sensor has different angle ranges from those of gmapping?

Please edit your title to make it match the actual question: change "range" to "angle range"

A:

The lidar angle range can be different between gmapping and "normal" navigation. They are independent. Once you have a map that is accurate, that map can even be used by other robots, even those having other types of sensors (e.g. ultrasonic range finder.)
