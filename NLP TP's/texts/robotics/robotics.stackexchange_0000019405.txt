Q:

360 Continuous Rotation Servo only goes 180 degrees

I bought the following servo: D DOLITY High Speed 360 Degree Continuous Rotation Servo for Robotic(15kg/cm) Metal Gears Servo
I'm trying to get it to spin in one direction continuously, but it looks like it can only go 180 degrees and then stops. 
Is there something wrong with my code that is making it stop at 180 degrees or is the product falsely advertised as a 360Â° continuous rotation servo? 
This is the Arduino code I'm using: 
Servo myservo;  //Servo name is myservo

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo signal pin on pin D6
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("0");// You can display on the serial the signal value
  myservo.write(0); //Turn clockwise at high speed
}

A:

Since you already determined that the servo acts as a positional servo, and not as a continuous rotation servo, then it is not a continuous rotation servo.
