A:

The kinect sensor, like all other sensors, doesn't provide perfect measure, there's a variation in the depth but it shouldn't be too large.

Regarding the depth of a particular point, you should do some point cloud tutorials so you can understand the meaning of the data you are receiving. For each point you can obtain the x, y and z coordinates in the frame of the camera.

thanks  for the answer, but can I retrieve depth of particular point without going in to pcl? by making use of opencv function cvGet2D in order to access the intensity of particular point
