Q:

Rviz Interactive Marker Control Scaling

How can I change the scaling of the controls (i.e., the rings and arrows) of an interactive marker (in C++)? They are much larger than the marker itself. I want them to be at about the size of the marker.

Why did you flag this question as "off-topic" in the end?

I actually flagged it as "off-topic or not relevant" because it is not relevant for me anymore (I found the answer) ;-)

Please don't forget people googling your question, and getting frustrated by finding a... closed topic! Be community-friendly, answer your own question ;)

Seriously did you find a way to scale these controls without scaling the meshes themselves? I really don't find how, there is no scale anywhere. Thanks by advance!

Ditto to @courrier. I reopened and posted an answer.

A:

Ok, in fact you won't find that inside the control but this is directly the visualization_msgs/InteractiveMarker.scale field!
