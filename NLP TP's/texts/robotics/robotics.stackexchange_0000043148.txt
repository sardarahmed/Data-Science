Q:

rosws problem fuerte

hi,
I have installed ROS successfully and also debian package for rosws. I have also setup a workspace for ROS with the command rosws init ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte. But after using the command mkdir ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox when I use rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox and I get an error stating command requires a target workspace. Kindly help me.........

A:

You need to execute
source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.sh

as stated at the tutorial, section 'Creating a new overlay'.

Even after executing this command, the $ROS_WORKSPACE is not set. I'm using Groovy under Ubuntu 12.10 32b. Any ideas why this happens?
