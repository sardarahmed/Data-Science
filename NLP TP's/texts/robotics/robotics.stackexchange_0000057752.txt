A:

Since latching must be done on a per-connection level it is done by the publishing node when a new subscriber connects to it.

That doesn't make sense in a pub/sub model. It seems to me like the Master should be handling this in the Topic Handling rather than sending new connections to a Publisher. I assumed the Publisher didn't know anything about it, and the master (server) acted as a proxy that streamed the message to whomever subscribed to the Topic.... Any idea why?
