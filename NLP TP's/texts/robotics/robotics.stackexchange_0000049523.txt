Q:

Groovy Python node cannot find move_base_msgs module

Hello,
My setup: Latest Groovy debs on Ubuntu 12.04LTS.
I have a simple Python node in a catkin package that needs to import MoveBaseAction and MoveBaseGoal from move_base_msgs.  My import line looks like this:
from move_base_msgs.msg import MoveBaseAction, MoveBaseGoal

which worked fine in Fuerte.  My package.xml file includes the line:
<run_depend>move_base_msgs</run_depend>

And my Groovy debian installation has the move_base_msgs package installed:
$ rospack find move_base_msgs
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation/move_base_msgs

But when I try to run the node I get the error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/patrick/Dropbox/Robotics/ros/catkin_ws/src/rbx2/rbx2_tasks/nodes/nav_tasks.py", line 35, in <module>
    from move_base_msgs.msg import MoveBaseAction, MoveBaseGoal
ImportError: No module named move_base_msgs.msg

Other message imports work fine; for example, I can import the Odometry message type from nav_msgs.msg using:
from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry

with the following line in my package.xml file:
  <run_depend>nav_msgs</run_depend>

What am I doing wrong?
Thanks!
patrick

Sorry I can't help. ROS by example is a great book though, just wanted to say thanks, helped a lot with my final year project:)

Thanks @Tadhg Fitzgerald :-)

A:

Catkin packages can only depend on catkin packages, and move_base_msgs has yet to be catkinized.

Thanks @fergs.  Guess I'll wait until Hydro to do any more playing with catkin...

I am getting the same issue. Can you share the link for catkinized move_base_msgs.
