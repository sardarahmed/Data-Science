Q:

Positioning multi-robot on static map

Hi,
I make a package with two Turtlebots and share a static map on Gazebo. My problem is that I can positionning Turtlebots where I want on a static global map.
I use GMapping and MoveBase and I try to make an exploration of an unknown environment.
When I use AMCL, turtlebots move between the center of the map and the real robot's position.
Is it possible to initialise the position of each Turtlebot on static map, and how ?
Thanks

A:

AMCL has initial_pose parameters. These parameters may help you to initialise the pose of robots.
~initial_pose_x (double, default: 0.0 meters) 
~initial_pose_y (double, default: 0.0 meters) 
~initial_pose_a (double, default: 0.0 radians)
~initial_cov_xx (double, default: 0.50.5 meters) 
~initial_cov_yy (double, default: 0.50.5 meters)
~initial_cov_aa (double, default: (π/12)*(π/12) radian)

Thank, I use these config at first. But with this, my robot was jumping between the center of static map and his real position.
I made an exploration of unknown environment so I need a stable robot which doesn't jump.
Do you think if I plublish on the initialpose topics it can help me to fixe it ?
