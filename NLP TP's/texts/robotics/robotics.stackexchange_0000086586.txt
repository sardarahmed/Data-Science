Q:

What are the minimum requirements for releasing a package into the ROS distro for the first time

I am editing the question to more accurately reflect what I am trying to understand. I want to know what what the minimum requirements are for a package to be eligible for being incorporated into the ROS distro.

I have not been successful in getting the package released

it would help tremendously if you could describe in a bit more detail what did not work, or what prevented you from releasing the package. It's not enough to state that you have not been successful.

@gvdhoorn is correct that we need more information to provide guidance. What steps of the tutorial yielded results you did not expect? If you saw errors, can you post the error text here for us to examine?

A:

I'm not sure what dimensions you're asking about. To be released into the ROS distro it basically just needs to be a well formed package.
