Q:

How are ros_control controllers and hardware_interfaces used?

Dear all,
The doc for ros_control says ros_control provides controller interfaces. Does that mean ros_control abstracts real controllers?

I noticed ros_control also provides software controllers? I guess these are mostly used for simulation or for cheap control in real life, is that right?
Now, are the controllers interfaces (i.e. controllers abstractions) used both in case of real hardware drivers and in case of ros_control emulated controllers?

Thanks,
Antoine.
PS: please note that I have read all the doc I could find for ros_control (both in the wiki or on github).

Is this question still valid or can it be closed?. Since it was asked many interactions have taken place in the robot control SIG.
