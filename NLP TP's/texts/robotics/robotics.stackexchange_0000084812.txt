Q:

is it possible to communicate between two ROS systems, exploring in one, and SLAM in the other?

Hello everyone,
I have question about if it possible for one ROS system to do an exploring (Raspberry pi) and transfer data to other ROS system (LINUX) To Use SLAM to draw a map ?
if yes, can someone tells me the main idea or how to start
Thank you
*Because i have seen communication between two ROS system, but i was not sure if is it possible to the extension of using SLAM and RVIZ to have the map on the other machine

What do you mean by

two ROS systems

? Two computers both running ROS on the same network with the same Master? Something else?

What i mean a Raspberry pi with Jessie OS on it, that runs ROS
but since the Raspberry pi can not handle RVIZ
I will run RVIZ on another computer

A:

The short answer is "yes." Take a look at http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines to see how to set that up.
In practice you'll need to be careful about managing the data flowing over the network. You should run roscore and the motor controllers and sensor drivers on the RPi so that your robot is responsive and immune from network hiccups. On the desktop you can run SLAM and exploration; these consume lots of CPU but generate small messages like tf transforms. The challenge is getting the sensor data up to your desktop reliably. Laser data is pretty small, but pointclouds can be huge, so you'll probably need to downsample on the RPi. It really depends on your situation.
