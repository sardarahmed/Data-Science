Q:

I have found a simple link mistake in wiki documents. Where should I report

At the page http://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?distro=indigo&name=gazebo_ros
the website link leading to help ros and gazebo integration is now directs to a unrelated place.
The correct place should be http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=connect_ros
Where should I report these kinds of corrections ? I have seen the ticket system but I don't know which group this small mistake falls in?  Is there a documentation contact point for the project there was also some kind of additions that could be made to some of tutorials.

A:

Normally, I would say that you should edit the wiki to fix any mistakes you find.
In this particular case, it looks like that page is auto-generated from the package documentation, so you should probably file a ticket against the package.
It looks like their bug tracker is here: https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues
