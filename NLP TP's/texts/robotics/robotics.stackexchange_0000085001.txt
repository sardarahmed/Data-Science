Q:

gazebo_ros_turtlebot3.cpp with real robot (waffle)

Hi,
I would like to know why the gazebo_ros_turtlebot3.cpp, used to make the turtlebot3 autonomously navigates in the gazebo 3D, does not work with the real robot? I am using a turtlebot3 waffle. What changes do I have to make in the cpp code, or in the launch file, in order to make it works with the real robot?
What I mean is, if I run roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch and after that I run roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch  the turtlebot3 navigates into the simulator. But, if I run roscore in the pc, and, after that, I  run roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch in the turtlebot3 waffle, and then run roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch  the turtlebot3 does not navegate, it just  spins around itself. But, if i run roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch, I can teleoperate the robot normaly using the keyboard.
Thanks.

A:

Gazebo is the simulator. The launch file turtlebot3_simulation.launch is designed to work within the simulation not in the real robot. turtlebot3_simulation.launch is a demo that will help you see a fully functioning system in the simulation.
For instructinos on how to bring up the TB3 please see: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/bringup/#turtlebot3-waffle
There are other sections with instructions on how to setup navigation: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/navigation/#perform-navigation
