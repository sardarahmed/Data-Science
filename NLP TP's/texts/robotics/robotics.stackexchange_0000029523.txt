Q:

pr2_computer_monitor with lm_sensors

I would like to create a similar node as the pr2_computer_monitor, but I do not have access to a computer with IMPI (as I would assume most people don't have).  I was wondering if anyone has written a similar monitoring node with lm_sensors, which is something that just about every computer is capable of running.
I am mainly interested in temperatures, voltages, and fan speeds, as my robot runs in a high-temperature, battery operated environment (Alabama in the summer).

A:

I have not yet tried it, but I believe you use the pr2_computer_monitor as an example to build a package that will pull information from stdout and stderr of a given command.  If you look in the bottom of nvidia_smi_util.py, you can see how to execute a commmand and pull its output.  It launches: sudo nvidia-smi -a, so you could change that to an lm_sensors command that that outputs your desired temperature reading.
Also, there is a package called nvidia_gpu_monitor, but I have not tried it.

We would be interested in such a package. Please post an announcement on ros-users if you get something ready to publish (or test).

Perhaps I'll branch off of the pr2_computer_monitor package and make a more generic one for lm_sensors.  I figured that it was possible, but I was trying to save a bit of work on something that is far from critical for our project.  Thanks for the help.
