Q:

Error building package cvg_sim_gazebo_plugins in tum_simulator

Hi all,
I am trying to install the tum_simulator package following the instruction shown on the ROS wiki page. When I get to building the cvg_sim_gazebo_plugins package (using rosmake) I am getting the following error:
[ 30%] [ 38%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/diffdrive_plugin_6w.dir/src/diffdrive_plugin_6w.cpp.o

Could someone kindly point out what is causing the problem? From what I can understand the "physics.h" header file in "diffdrive_plugin_6w.cpp" does not exist. If that is the case how could I solve it?
Thanks in advance,
JP

I know this is not an answer to your problem but I found several problems installing the tum_simulator using groovy. I tried to find a way to fix these issues but had no luck. As a result I installed ubuntu 12.04 and ros Fuerte and everything worked perfectly.
