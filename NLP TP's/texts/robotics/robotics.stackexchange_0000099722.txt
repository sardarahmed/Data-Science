Q:

Releasing packages with bloom, what can go in the "doc" field?

When running bloom-release on a repository I'm trying to release, bloom asks for a link to the documentation.
Upon inspection of distribution.yaml, it seems that most maintainers just have a link to their project github repo.
In my project, I am writing up my user guide with ReadTheDocs. I think the simplicity of RTD is great for writing up a user guide that doesn't have to explicitly refer to parts of the code.
Now, is it appropriate to use a link, such as https://soccer-interfaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, in the doc field of the bloom-release? Or does it have to be a ros wiki page?

The information Bloom asks for is not necessarily a "link to the documentation". It asks for the source repository which could contain documentation (ie: in addition to source code). In most cases, that will be the repository containing the C++/Python/whatever sources for your package, as that would result in automatic builds of API documentation and some other things.
For the ROS 1 side of this (and perhaps to clarify what Bloom is asking for), see Indexing Your ROS Repository for Documentation Generation.

A:

Refer to @gvdhoorn 's comment for details:

Bloom is asking for the source repository which could contain documentation

So, a user manual hosted on RTD shouldn't be in the "doc" field.
