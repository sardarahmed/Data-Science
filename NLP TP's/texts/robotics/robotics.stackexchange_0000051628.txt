Q:

Groovy Installation - "Failed to process package 'tf2_ros'" in "catkin_make_isolated" - MacBook OSX

After resolving the dependencies in the installation of groovy on a MacBook Pro with OS 10.8.3, I input the command
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install

This command executes several installations, but fails when trying to trying to process the "tf2_ros" package. The first error that I see is the "undefined symbols for architecture x86_64":
==> Processing catkin package: 'tf2_ros'
==> Building with env: '/Users/jjameson/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh'
Makefile exists, skipping explicit cmake invocation...

This is the last few lines before the installation exits.

<== Failed to process package 'tf2_ros': 
  Command '/Users/jjameson/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> /Users/jjameson/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4

Command failed, exiting.

So I then input the command to reproduce the error
/Users/jjameson/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4

And the output for this command is
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.

I'm honestly getting a little lost in the code here and not really sure where to go. Thanks for any help.

Yes, the command that is initially used, "./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install", is the first in section 2.1.3. My installation is getting held up when the "tf2_ros" package is being processed during this command.

I was actually referring to this part: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source#tf2_ros_fails_to_build

Haha, well I guess the answer was right in front of my face... Thanks for the help.
