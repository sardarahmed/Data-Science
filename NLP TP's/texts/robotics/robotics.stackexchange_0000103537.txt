Q:

unable to locate package ros-humble-desktop ubuntu 22.04

I am using ubuntu 22.04 and I am getting the error of unable to locate package when trying to install the ros 2 humble. I followed the instructions on the ros.org page for humble.
The following commands were used to set up the sources.
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe

sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

This was all successful
Then I proceeded to try and install the ros 2 packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop  this part fails
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base also fails

here is the link for the ros doc

A:

(copying my comment on the issue you opened over at github.com/ros2/ros here for visibility)
The screenshot shows you're running 22.04 on an ARMhf platform.
Only Ubuntu on ARMv8 gets .deb packages (ie: packages you can install using apt). ARMhf (or arm32) users need to build ROS 2 from source.
See also REP 2000: ROS 2 Releases and Target Platforms: Humble Hawksbill (May 2022 - May 2027) (ARMv8 is called arm64 in that document).
