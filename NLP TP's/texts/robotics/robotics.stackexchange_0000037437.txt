Q:

ROS minimal installation

Hi all,
Is there a preferred method for doing a minimal installation (smaller than ros-base)... such that the robot would be more of an embedded target and the development environment would be some logical setup (some VM).
I'm working with a com-express board with an atom processor and a 4GB hard drive. I'm trying to get the install as compact as possible. Any thoughts (even a different direction than the "embedded target") would be greatly appreciated.
