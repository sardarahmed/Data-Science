Q:

What does the parameter ~sensor_model/max_range mean in octomap server?

Hi guys,
With the sensor_model/max_range set to 5, the points of my point cloud that are longer than 5 still get inserted in the map. e.g. the max readings from the LRF
What does sensor_model/max_range really mean?

Thank you in advance

A:

octomap_server will truncate all rays longer than max_range to that range and clear up to that range. That means that longer rays won't be dropped but will still be used to update the free space. If your max range measurements actually mean errors which should not be integrated then you need to filter the points yourself or set them to "nan" in the point cloud. These error values will then be dropped.

The link with the image is not loading. But the parameter needs to be "" in the octomap_server's private node namespace.
