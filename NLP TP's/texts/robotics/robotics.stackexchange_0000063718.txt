Q:

Restoring household_objects_database

I'm trying to connect household_objects_database to object_recognition_kitchen in ROS Hydro. I'm following this tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/household_objects_database/Tutorials/Install%20the%20household_objects%20database%20on%20your%20local%20database%20server). I've tried to restore the database from several backup files, but it never works.
For example, household_objects-experimental.backup gives:
pg_restore: [archiver (db)] Error while PROCESSING TOC:
pg_restore: [archiver (db)] Error from TOC entry 430; 1247 26713 TYPE model_result willow
pg_restore: [archiver (db)] could not execute query: ERROR:  type "model_result" already exists
    Command was: CREATE TYPE model_result AS (
    f1 text,
    f2 text,
    f3 double precision,
    f4 double precision,
    f5 double precision
);

This sounds more like a postgres question. Perhaps their documentation will be helpful? http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/sql-droptype.html

I guess I restored it on one computer. How do I use the models now? The documentation seems to be brief ...

I can't really help you interpret the models. The best I can do is point you at the message documentation: http://docs.ros.org/groovy/api/object_manipulation_msgs/html/index-msg.html
