Q:

Using a CradlePoint router with ROS

Hello,
I am working on a project that requires long range communication using a cell network. We have a 4G modem with a static IP address that is attached to a CradlePoint CTR-500 router. This router is then linked into the robot's computer through eth0. While the static IP address is in the 66._ _ _. _ _ . _ _ _ range, the CradlePoint creates a LAN in the 192.168.0. _ _ subnet, and this is what the computer views its IP address as.
I have a base station located far away that is connected to the internet. I can ping the USB modem from the base station, and the robot's computer can ping the base station, but I cannot connect to each of them through ROS. I imagine that I will have to set up some sort of port forwarding to get them to communicate.
If anyone has any suggestions on how I can connect the two computers through ROS, I would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you,
-Joe

A:

Go through the tutorials and there are tutorials on how to do that. Also double check your router's firewall isn't blocking the ports that ROS is trying to use.
