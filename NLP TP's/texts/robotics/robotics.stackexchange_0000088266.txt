Q:

turtlebot_fake: can have no objects, correct?

It seems to me that turtlebot_fake when run with rviz will be operating in a totally open field and there is now way to create a map and/or define objects for it to run into it. Am I seeing that corectly?

Hi :)
turtlebot3_fake node is to simulate turtlebot3 in Rviz.
As you mention that it doesn't include any objects. If you want to load objects, you are supposed to make code yourself.
