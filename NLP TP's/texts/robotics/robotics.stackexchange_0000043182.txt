Q:

simplest robot with ROS

Hello,
By using arduino serial, I have made a tracked vehicle move, read distance sensors, and turn a servo. Right now there is no encoders in the bot, and I understand this is a necessity.
What is the simplest robot stack that I can run with my setup? Right now I am working on teleoperation. And I am planning to maybe start from turtlebot sim, and maybe connect it so that turtlesim moves with the robot.
I understand that my setup is really limited. I wanted to do robotics as a hobby, so I bought bunch of arduinos and sensors, then I quickly understood I can't do the things I want to with the arduino, and then i discovered ros.
Any ideas/recomendations/help greatly appreciated.
C.B.

What, exactly, do you want to accomplish? That is, what's your end goal? Without some sense of where you want to go, this question is very vague.

ok, for example, i want to go around, and if i sense something turn left. arduino_serial provides convenient way to communicate with hardware. where do we run this code? we have to make a ros stack???

A:

You should formulate some goals which you want to achieve and what kind of robot you want to create. A vacuum cleaning robot can also move randomly, then you don't need encoders. As encoders are quite expensive to buy you can also build them yourself like in this example: http://www.geology.smu.edu/~dpa-www/robo/Encoder/pitt_html/encoders.html
