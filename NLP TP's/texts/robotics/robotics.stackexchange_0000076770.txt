Q:

QR Code Detector?

Is anyone aware of a QR code detector library, preferrably in Python, that's efficient enough to locate and track QR Codes in an image in real-time? I'm trying to program a small robot to search for a specific QR code, and then once it's found, track its movement and follow it around.
I've found a ton of encoders, for generating QR Codes, and decoders, for reading the text from the pristine generated images, but there seems to almost nothing for detecting QR codes from raw noisy images or video feeds. Considering how many QR reading Android apps there are, I find this difficult to believe.
I've found a few proof-of-concept tutorials like this and this, but these look like hacky one-offs that are no longer maintained, or even packaged properly.
I've also found a couple ROS projects like this and this, but these also look unmaintained, as well as enormously over-complicated, and need extensive calibration. Is there anything else I'm missing?

ar_track_alvar I have used before for this.

A:

Vision visp is not just for reading but also tracking the qr codes: http://wiki.ros.org/visp_auto_tracker
For just reading you might want to look at http://wiki.ros.org/zbar_ros
Most people use AR tags though and http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar it's optimized for the tracking elements not data carrying like QR codes.
