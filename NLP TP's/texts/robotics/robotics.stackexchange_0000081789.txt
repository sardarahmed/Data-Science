Q:

Navigation problem with COB3, DWAPlanerROS create Fail

Hi,
I am trying to navigate COB3 using cob_navigation_global.
Environment: Ubuntu 14.04.5, ROS-Indigo
I have launched COB3 in Gazebo using cob_bringup_sim
and then when I am trying to launch
roslaunch cob_navigation_global 2dnav_ros_dwa.launch

I am getting error like
[ INFO] [1500056989.693549168, 7.436000000]: Using plugin "inflation_layer"
[FATAL] [1500056989.982608166, 7.472000000]: Failed to create the dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS with base class type nav_core::BaseLocalPlanner does not exist.

log file: /home/shaon/.ros/log/3b552036-68c2-11e7-92c7-184f32ad4b7f/move_base-53*.log

NOTE: Before everything was working perfectly, For some reason I had to reinstall ubuntu and all other things like ros-indigo etc. from then it is not working anymore. I have tried reinstall everything again. But no luck
Any idea??
Thanks in advance

Thanks David, you saved my day :) It is working now...
But I am receiving some other error, which was not before..
[ INFO] [1500067204.859911323, 89.950000000]: Got new plan
[ WARN] [1500067204.936564734, 89.962000000]: DWA planner failed to produce path.

can you identify the reason?

thank you so much... the same applies to Turtlebot3 simulations with ros-melodic, the package still the same, just had to change the distro.
