Q:

how can i use sonar with hector_mapping package (laser and IMU) to draw map?

i created /map with laser an imu by hector_mapping package. but how can i use sonar (with laser and imu) too create better map?

A:

It's non-trivial to improve LIDAR based maps using sonar sensors, as they return only one very noisy measurement for a cone in front of the sensor. There is no ready to use ROS package for sonar mapping available AFAIK.
/edit: So what is relatively easy to do is just using the pose provided by the SLAM system and following a "mapping with known poses" approach, building a independent map in parallel that incorporates LIDAR and sonar data. This would avoid the issue of the SLAM map degrading from noisy sonar data and allow to create a better map in the sense that for instance glass could be detected via sonar.

But won't sonar be helpful to detect glass?

True, I edited the answer to discuss this aspect.
