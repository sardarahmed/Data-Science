Q:

create ROS workspace - command not found

I've installed:
ROS Indigo
Trusty (14.04)
I'm stuck in the ROS installation at
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
3. Managing your environment
When I run the command:
$ export | grep ROS

The terminal outputs:
$: command not found

The same thing happens when I attempt any of the commands there after on the guide.
Checking ROS Installation
When I run the command:
which roscore

The terminal outputs:
/opt/ros/indigo/bin/roscore

Attempting to uninstall ROS
When I run the command:
sudo apt-get remove ros

The terminal outputs:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros

Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks!

Is your shell a bash? The first "command not found" error looks odd. apt-get remove ros won't work, because there is no package named ros. To uninstall put the packages you used from the install tutorial.

A:

The command is export | grep ROS. You have put a $ sign before that, that's why you are getting that error!

This is the solution to the problem, so I converted this to an answer.
