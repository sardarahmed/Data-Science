Q:

What is autoware?

Hello community,
stupid question, but not clear for me, in the context of ROS:
What is autoware ?
What is the relationship with ros ? I did not understand the hype (a lot of traffic) at ros discussion forum.
Thank for some hints :-)
Cheers
Chrimo

+1, the first this hit my radar was this year and there's been alot of movement From Geoff and others which has been fascinating to watch.

Autoware is a framework for self-driving built on top of ROS. You can think of it as the self-driving vehicle equivalent of something like MoveIt. While the current version is built on ROS 1, the next version is being built on ROS 2 with a much greater focus on things like safety, security and robustness.
I'm not sure I would call the increase in traffic on Discourse "hype". It's more that the traffic has moved there from elsewhere, mainly the GitHub issue tracker. The project has been around for quite a while.
