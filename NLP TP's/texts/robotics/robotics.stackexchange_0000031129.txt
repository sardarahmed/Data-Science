Q:

How to set the dimensions of the initial pose array

The initial pose array is really much bigger than it needs to be.  How do I change it's initial dimensions?

No I don't mean the number of particles, I mean the dimensions over which the particles are initially distributed.

That's a good point actually, I guess you can change the dimensions of that array by changing the number of particles AMCL uses.

Do you mean the number of particles (elements in the array) or just the overall spread of those particles, say, when visualized in rviz?

There is an array of poses published to /particlecloud, I think by amcl.

I'm not totally sure what array you're referring to. Are you talking about the PoseWithCovarianceStamped message that's sent to AMCL? The ParticleCloud message published by AMCL? Or something else entirely?

A:

From looking at the code, AMCL sizes the pose array in the "particlecloud" message to be the size of the number of guesses it currently has for the robot's pose. There's no way to change its initial dimensions. If you just want the current pose of the robot displayed in rviz, you can enable TF frames and look at the "base_link" frame relative to the "map" frame. The "particlecloud" message, provides a visualization that helps give insight into the particle filter AMCL uses internally.
