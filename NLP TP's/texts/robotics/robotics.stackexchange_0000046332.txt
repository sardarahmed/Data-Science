Q:

no matching function for call to message_filters::sync_policies::ApproximateTime

Hi All
I am using ROS to subscribe some camera topics in two different ways.
Fist subscribe Topic from published messages and second subscribe them directly from bag file without playing bag the file , just read it directly.
in this program i have two different constructor one for published message and the other for reading file in each of the there are functions which do these tasks.
I have this error :
**/opt/ros/fuerte/include/message_filters/synchronizer.h:152: error: no matching function for call to 'message_filters::sync_policies::ApproximateTime<sensor_msgs::CameraInfo_<std::allocator<void> >, sensor_msgs::Image_<std::allocator<void> >, sensor_msgs::Image_<std::allocator<void> > >::ApproximateTime()'**

these are my constructors :
//for reading bag file 

FOVISODOMETRY::FOVISODOMETRY(vector<string> cameraTopices,
        const string bagFileName, const char* visual_odom_frame_name)
{
/// some implementations 
}

////for subscribing from published massages 

FOVISODOMETRY::FOVISODOMETRY(const char* image_topic,
        const char* depth_image_topic, const char* camera_info_topic,
        const char* visual_odom_frame_name) :
        initialized_(false), fovis_initialized_(false), depth_image_(NULL),       depth_data_(
                NULL), grayscale_data_(NULL), rect_(NULL), odom_(NULL), node_(
                ""), private_node_("~"), camera_info_sub_(node_,
                camera_info_topic, 100), rgb_image_sub_(node_, image_topic,
                100), depth_image_sub_(node_, depth_image_topic, 100),image_sync_(
                ApproximateTimeCustomPolicy(10), camera_info_sub_,
                rgb_image_sub_, depth_image_sub_), odom_broadcaster_()

{
/// some implementations 
}

and these are the massage filter Synchronizer :
typedef message_filters::sync_policies::ApproximateTime<
            sensor_msgs::CameraInfo, sensor_msgs::Image, sensor_msgs::Image> ApproximateTimeCustomPolicy;

message_filters::Synchronizer<ApproximateTimeCustomPolicy> image_sync_;   

there is one point : when I omit the file reading constructor its has no error
but as soon as I add the second constructor the error appears .
please let me how can I have both of my constructors and also no error
thank you in advance

Hi Christian
Thank you for you answer. It was a good hint , but in order to get ride of that error I have to do initialize the second constructor like this :
FOVISODOMETRY::FOVISODOMETRY(vector cameraTopices,
const string bagFileName, const char visual_odom_frame_name):image_sync_(
ApproximateTimeCustomPolicy(10), camera_info_sub_,
rgb_image_sub_, depth_image_sub_)*
but I still have one question : Although I don't use it in second constructor ,why  should I initialize this message_filter::synchronizer  ?
would you please help me on this !
thanks  in advance .
Ramin
typedef message_filters::sync_policies::ApproximateTime<
sensor_msgs::CameraInfo, sensor_msgs::Image, sensor_msgs::Image> ApproximateTimeCustomPolicy;
message_filters::Synchronizer image_sync_;

There is not default constructor, so you need to provide the parameters to the constructor by hand, otherwise the object cannot be created.
