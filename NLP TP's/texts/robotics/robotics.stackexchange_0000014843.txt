Q:

Scara robot design

I found this drawing on google photos:

I don't understand why he used this part.

Is it for reduction?
What is its equation?

A:

One of the problems with a belt driven SCARA system like this is that as the belts age, they stretch, so every belt should have a tensioner.
If you look carefully, it is clear that plate 106 rotates around shaft 114, and you can see the spring which provides the tension below it. Cogs 102 and 104 are free running. When the belt is new, plate 106 will be pushed close to the position shown. As the belt ages, the force of the spring will rotate plate 106 anti-clockwise, maintaining the tension of the belt.
This design cleverly tensions both straight sections of belt at the same time, by the same amount, and with the same pressure. This should make the system less susceptible to problems with unidirectional repeatability (moving from -90 to 0 resulting in a different position than moving from 90 to 0 for instance).
