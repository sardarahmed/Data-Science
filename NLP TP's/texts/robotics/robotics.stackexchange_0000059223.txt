Q:

RosTutorials won't build on Raspberry Pi running Hydro

I've installed hydro onto a raspberry pi having built the package following the instructions on the website. I've fetched the tutorials from github so I can run the turtlesim. The build keeps failing with the following error.  It's probably something fairly obvious...
<== Finished processing package [56 of 63]: 'rosnode'

A:

So I ran into essentially this same issue while compiling ROS Indigo on Raspberry Pi as per [1]. In my case /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/std_msgs/share/std_msgs had no msg directory. I worked around it by:
cd /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/std_msgs/share/std_msgs
ln -s /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/std_msgs/msg

Not sure why the msg directory didn't get setup in the first place... or why the message search path doesn't just point to src/std_msgs/msg... or how to even configure the search path... but at least the error message was informative enough to get me going again without a lot of frustration.
