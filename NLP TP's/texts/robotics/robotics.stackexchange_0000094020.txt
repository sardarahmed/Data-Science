Q:

Solvpnp() rvec to ros tf

Hi
Im using python opencv solvepnp() solver to find the camera to object transformation for hand2eye calibration for my robot. It returns translation vector and rotation vector. But i want to convert rotation vector into ros tf. Ie, in my solvepnp() rvec have only x,y,z values are there. But in tf there is x,y,z,w values.is ther any function to convert vector to quarternion in python?? Sorry, im very new to ros..

A:

Hi
I solved it using tf. using
from tf.transformations import quaternion_from_euler
3
4 if name == 'main':
5
6   # RPY to convert: 90deg, 0, -90deg
7   q = quaternion_from_euler(1.5707, 0, -1.5707)
