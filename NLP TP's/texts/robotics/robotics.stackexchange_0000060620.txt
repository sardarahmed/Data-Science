Q:

undefined reference using depthimage_to_laserscan

I'm trying to convert a Image taken by a Kinect into a LaserScan, but I have the following compile error when creating an instance of DepthImageToLaserScan:
undefined reference to `depthimage_to_laserscan::DepthImageToLaserScan::DepthImageToLaserScan()'

I found out that it is a linker issue, but I don't know how to fix it. I would really appreciate any help.
Code to create the instance of DepthImageToLaserScan:
depthimage_to_laserscan::DepthImageToLaserScan image_to_laser_converter_;

A:

Did you include the package depthimage_to_laserscan as build_dep, and run_dep in package.xml as well as in
find_package(catkin REQUIRED roscpp depthimage_to_laserscan .... )

in your CMakeLists.txt ?
