Q:

ROS Kinect - Getting sensor data

I am new to the ROS middleware framework and I do not understand how I would extract the sensor point data from the Kinect using C++?
I have been looking into using the sensor_msgs/PoinntCloud2.h and extracting the points that will be able to publish the data onto a new topic called "kinect_sensor" but I cannot seem to find any tutorials out there which will allow me to do this?
Hope someone can help

A:

If I understood well, you simply want to publish kinect data over ROS. Then I suggest you to look at this package.
Once your Kinect is connected, simply run the command:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

it will publish a list of topic with depth image, rgb image, point cloud, info etc.

@Tirjen Thanks for your reply. I have installed open_ni and want to use the topic on point cloud, this is fine. I just don't know how to  access this using C++ in a subscriber and talker scripts.. Any advice?

So you have a topic publishing a PointCloud2 message and you want to subscribe to it? If so, just subscribe to it as to any other topic.
inside your code declare a publisher a node handle and then subscribe to it:
ros::Subscriber cloudsub_=n_.subscribe("/camera/depth/points", 1, cloudcb);
where cloudcb is your callback function.
