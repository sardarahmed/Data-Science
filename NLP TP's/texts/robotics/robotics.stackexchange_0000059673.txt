Q:

Storing the data inside an array as rosbag

Hi,
Is there a way I can store data in my array (inside a c++ program) as rosbag? Just like I can store it as txt or csv file. I know we can store data being published over a ros topic as rosbag but I am wondering if I can do that without publishing the data on rostopic.
regards

A:

rosbag has a C++ API that you can use directly in your code: http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Code%20API
But I think everything you store will need to be ROS messages. So you'd need to define a ROS message type for your array, e.g. a file called "Foo.msg" which contains "float64[] some_array". Then you need to get catkin to generate code wrappers for that message.
