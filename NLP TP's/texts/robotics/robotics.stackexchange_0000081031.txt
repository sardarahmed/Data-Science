Q:

How to start for a slam system

Hi all,
I am using ROS Indigo with ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I want to make a slam system on a simulated environment. Now, my question is How should I get started with a robot simulator? I have seen tutorials on turtlebot, but they I think are for real hardware, but I needed a simulated turtlebot. where could I find tutorials on that?
Thanks
