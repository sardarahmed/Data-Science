Q:

how to plot one topic against another in ros

I have two topics publishing the std_msgs/Float32 message. Is there a way I can plot the data in one topic against the other?

A:

Check out rqt_plot.
This provides a scrolling plot of data from multiple topics on the same axis, as a function of time. If you needed topic1 vs topic2, I don't know of an easier solution than writing a quick python node that listens to both topics then plots the data after a specified time.
EDIT: I don't love it (would love another alternative!), but I use matplotlib. The documentation isn't easy to get started with, so I'd just look at the example code and plots in the gallery.

I've checked out rqt_plot, and as far as I can tell, it can't plot one topic vs. another. What would you use to plot in python?
