Q:

How to see where rviz is looking for plugins

I am trying to build a package that add a simple plugins to rviz, following the rviz_plugin_tutorial example.
It now compiles with catkin_make.
I have the export tag in package.xml and a plugin_description.xml.
I have properly source my catkin_workspace.
But if I run rviz, it does not appear in the add panel list. and I have no debug/error anywhere
I am now looking for some ways to debug this. Is there a way to see where 'pluginlib' is looking for plugins, or other way to have a bit more verbosity on the plugin part ?

A:

See wiki/pluginlib - Providing a Plugin - Querying ROS Package System For Available Plugins.
That is basically what RViz does.
Check #q163476 for a related question.
