Q:

ROSARIA install on Hydro

Hi,
I'm relatively new to ROS and need to install a couple of packages to control an ActivMedia Powerbot (Pioneer). I am following the tutorial found here but I was unsuccessful in getting it to work. By following this tutorial, everything seemed ok, and the result of catkin_make can be shown below:

When I tried the command,
rosrun rosaria RosAria

the following error was obtained:
[ERROR] [1422117443.016309109]: [setParam] Failed to contact master at [localhost:11311].  Retrying...

Can anybody explain this error to me please? When I kill the process, first it connects to the simulator and disconnects immediately. If I don't kill the process, it keeps on retrying to contact master....
^CConnecting to simulator through tcp.

Please help.

Well, it is an error, but it also already tells you what is wrong: the node (RosAria) cannot contact the (ROS) master. Most likely because you haven't started it yet.
You mention that you're "relatively new to ROS": have you done the ROS introductory tutorials? I think especially the Understanding ROS Nodes tutorial should help here, and ros/wiki/Master:

The ROS Master provides naming and registration services to the rest of the nodes in the ROS system. It tracks publishers and subscribers to topics as well as services. The role of the Master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another. Once these nodes have located each other they communicate with each other peer-to-peer.

The Master also provides the Parameter Server.

The Master is most commonly run using the roscore command, which loads the ROS Master along with other essential components.
