Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: mail glitch

At the top of the screen, there is an image of an envelope that turns red when there is new mail. For some reason, it is currently red, but I am 100% sure that I have no unread mail. Because of this, in the future it will not be as obvious when I have new mail. Is there a way to fix this?
