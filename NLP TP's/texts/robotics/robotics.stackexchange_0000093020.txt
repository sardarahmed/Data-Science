Q:

ImportError: No module named Crypto

I'm having my coworker follow the directions on this page to install rosbag
http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows
so that he can reindex corrupted .bag files in the future, we've followed the directions to a 'T' but are still receiving this import error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\opt\ros\melodic\x64\bin\rosbag", line 34, in <module>
    import rosbag
  File "C:\opt\ros\melodic\x64\lib\site-packages\rosbag\__init__.py", line 33, in <module>
    from .bag import Bag, Compression, ROSBagException, ROSBagFormatException, ROSBagUnindexedException
  File "C:\opt\ros\melodic\x64\lib\site-packages\rosbag\bag.py", line 53, in <module>
    from Crypto import Random
ImportError: No module named Crypto

we tried installing Crypto and pycrypto manually, which all come back as successfull, but the error persists
Specs:
Windows 10
64-Bit
Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
2019 Build Tools, and the Microsoft C++ Compiler for Python 2.7

I have a feeling this might not be a Windows specific issue. #q370678 shows the same error on Ubuntu.

A:

Same as the answer on another thread #q370678 (answer), a dependency on cryptodome is defined in the very rosbag package so it should be installed during (build/)installation of rosbag. I'd recommend you to review how you (build/)installed rosbag.
