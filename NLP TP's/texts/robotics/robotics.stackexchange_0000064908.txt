There are a number of solutions for this problem. Search for "multimaster"

Normal tcpip using python is not too hard to do either.

Hi atp, i am not really good at that tcpip connection, can you advice me some good tutorial please? thanks

A:

It's not clear from your question exactly what capability you require.
The easy case: ROS is a distributed system that supports topic sharing between computers out-of-the-box -- you simply need to use the ROS_MASTER_URI environment variable (see the Running ROS across multiple machines tutorial).
If you really need separate masters running on individual computers, follow the advice given by @ahendrix about "multimaster".
