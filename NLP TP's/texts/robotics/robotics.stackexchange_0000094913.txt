Q:

The difference among diffierent tags melodic images in docker hub

I find in ros dockerhub, there are different images for melodic images, such as latest, melodic-ros-core-stretch,melodic-ros-base-stretch,what is the difference among those? Specifically, I want to know what the difference between core and base? What does stretch stand for?

A:

The DockerHub image naming is as follows:
ros:<ROS_DISTRO>-<ros metapackage>-<OS name>

So for ros:melodic-ros-base-stretch:

ROS distribution melodic
ROS metapackage ros_base
OS Name stretch (for Debian stretch), or bionic for Ubuntu bionic (18.04)

The content of the various packages ros_core, ros_base etc can be found on the metapackages repository:

ros_core: https://github.com/ros/metapackages/blob/20c6fe68aaca88813fa63821d3224865f28c9a10/ros_core/package.xml
ros_base: https://github.com/ros/metapackages/blob/20c6fe68aaca88813fa63821d3224865f28c9a10/ros_base/package.xml

As you can see ros_base is ros_core + actionlib, bond_core, dynamic_reconfigure, nodelet_core.

Perhaps REP 150 would be a more canonical source of information on the metapackages.

You're right, that's where the official list of repositories is defined.
In practice I tend to refer to the metapackages directly as it's the effective list and an easier place to retrieve and process (same files, to check another distro just need to change branch, machine readable).
It gets trickier with the REPs as you need to point to different sources based on the ROS disto (REP 142, REP 150 and maybe another one for Noetic) and within those reps check for verbiage like "kinetic and newer" to know what repositories are actually included.

Thanks @gvdhoorn! I had been searching for differences between "osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full" and "ros:melodic-ros-base-bionic" for a while now. The REP 150 reference contained the succinct answer.
