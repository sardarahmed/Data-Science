Q:

Drone for mavros

Hi !
So I want to build a small drone(can be tested in lab) and deploy ROS on it. Can anyone help me with what motors and flight controller that I should use to do so ?
I want to use mavros_pkg so want to load Arducopter firmware on the flight controller.

A:

Iv'e been using Navio2 hat for Raspberry Pi3 as FCU in my lab and it has been quite intuitive and easy.
Navio2 software comes pre-installed with ROS and the documentation is great.
As for a drone and motors, just check hobbyking.com and pick something in your budget and preferances.
