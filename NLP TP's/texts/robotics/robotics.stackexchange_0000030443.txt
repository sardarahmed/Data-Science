Q:

What can PointCloud2 store?

I'm using the pcl and need to pass over some normals with a point cloud (ie pcl::PointXYZRGBNormal points) to a service. Therefore I would like to know if the PointCloud2 can hold all this information (I now it is quite flexible).
More generally and because I think I might not be the only beginner wondering about:

A:

Well I finally found myself, I had not see this
http://www.ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html

This message holds a collection of
N-dimensional points, which may
contain additional information such as
normals, intensity, etc. The point
data is stored as a binary blob, its
layout described by the contents of
the "fields" array.
The point cloud data may be organized
2d (image-like) or 1d (unordered).
Point clouds organized as 2d images
may be produced by camera depth
sensors such as stereo or
time-of-flight.
