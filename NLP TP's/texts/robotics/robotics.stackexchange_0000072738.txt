Q:

Integrating Tensorflow into ROS

Hello, everyone. I would like to the Google's inception neural network that comes with Tensorflow in a ROS Package. However, I don't have any idea on how to do this. The build system of tensorflow is different from cmake (they use bazel). Does anyone know from where can I start this?
Thank you very much for any help!

A:

From now on, you can add
<run_depend>python-tensorflow-pip</run_depend>

into your package.xml, and you're ready to use tensorflow in python (after running rosdep, of course).
If you also need the C++ API, check out the experimental catkin package: https://github.com/tradr-project/tensorflow_ros .

Thank you for the answer. Well, I was able to integrate ROS and Tensorflow using Python. I found a sample python code using the Inception network at https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/imagenet. I modified this code for my needs and it worked great with ROS.

I will take a look into your code because I still need to learn how to internet tensorflow using C++ and Catkin.
