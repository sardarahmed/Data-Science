Q:

Unable to start handle detector

Hi all,
I am not able to start the handle detector.
When I run the handle localization: $ roslaunch handle_detector localization_sensor.launch I get this error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'tf2::LookupException'
what():  "base" passed to lookupTransform argument target_frame does not exist. 
[localization-1] process has died [pid 2931, exit code -6, cmd /home/christina/catkin_ws/devel/lib/handle_detector/handle_detector_localization __name:=localization __log:=/home/christina/.ros/log/fb4cc224-2aba-11e5-97ce-080027e4fc6e/localization-1.log].   log file: /home/christina/.ros/log/fb4cc224-2aba-11e5-97ce-080027e4fc6e/localization-1*.log    all processes on machine have died, roslaunch will exit    shutting down processing monitor...                                                                     ... shutting down processing monitor complete                                                          done

I have no idea to fix this problem.
Thanks in advance!

A:

You need to have a coordinate system (frame) called "base" in your robot model.
This is actually hardcoded in the handle_detector_localization node, so it cannot be set via a parameter.
Check whether your robot has a frame called "base", otherwise you need to add one.

I'm running with the turtlebot...
I'm doing roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch //to bring up the kinect v2
And running into the same error.
How do I add 'base' to the robot model?
