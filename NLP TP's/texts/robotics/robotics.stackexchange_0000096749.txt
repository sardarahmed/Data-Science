Q:

xsense ros kinetic package error-/usr/bin/ld: cannot find

Hi. I am trying to install xsens mti 3 imu driver.  When i do catkin make , i get an error
[ 30%] Built target robot_pose_ekf_generate_messages_nodejs

These folders(xscontroller-xscommon-xstypes) are in xsens package but bin/ld can not find ?ow can we solve that ?

A:

Check out the README in the package. it has some instructions.
Make sure the permissions are set to o+rw on your files and directories.

sudo chmod -R o+rw xsens_ros_mti_driver *

then build xspublic from your catkin workspace:

pushd src/xsens_ros_mti_driver/lib/xspublic && make && popd

after that run your catkin_make and it should work!
