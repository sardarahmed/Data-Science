Q:

How can I run rosserial without errors?

Hello everyone,
I'm new to ROS and I was trying to learn how to send a message from ROS to Arduino and the other way using rosserial. I am using ROS Kinetic with Ubuntu 16.04.4 .
Until now I could include ros_lib into the Arduino IDE as it says in the following link http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup , so I tried to do the next tutorials, first one is the example step by step for publisher (with HelloWorld program) as http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World and the second one is the example for subscriber (with blinking of led program) as this link http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink.
First, I compile the code in the Arduino IDE  and it does not show any error and then I upload it. Also, I checked the port and the baud of Arduino.
So next, I am giving the following commands in the terminal:

Roscore
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0 _baud:=9600

And when I try to run that node I get the following error in both programs (so that's why I think I have the error in the node):
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/sofia_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_python/nodes/serial_node.py", line 39, in <module>
    from rosserial_python import SerialClient, RosSerialServer
File "/home/sofia_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages/rosserial_python/__init__.py", line 35, in <module>
    exec(__fh.read())
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'SerialClient'

Since I'm new and I'm following the tutorials I do not know where is my error. I tried to look if there is something similar to this but I couldn't find anything resolved.
Thank you in advanced!! :)

A:

It looks like there is a problem with your rosserial_python installation. You have a setup mixed up between python 2 and 3. I suspect you installed rosserial_python with pip3. Uninstall it there and install it with sudo apt install ros-YOURDISTRO-rosserial-python.
