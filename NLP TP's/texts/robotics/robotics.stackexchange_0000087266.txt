Q:

Zero-copy intra-process messages with C RCL

Is this possible? I wouldn't think so since rcl_take requires a pointer to an already allocated message, but am I missing something?

A:

It's not possible at the C API level (rcl). Intraprocess communication (zero-copy or not) is only implemented in C++ (rclcpp) right now.
