Q:

Could not find tf/transform_listener.h

Hey there,
I have a problem with the tf package. In my code I'm using the following includes:
#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"
#include "sensor_msgs/LaserScan.h"
#include "RowDetection.h"
#include "tf/transform_listener.h"
#include "sensor_msgs/PointCloud.h"
#include "tf/message_filter.h"
#include "message_filters/subscriber.h"
#include "laser_geometry/laser_geometry.h"

In my manifest.xml I've added
<depend package="tf"/>

But rosmake does not compile and throws the following error
[...]src/main.cpp:15:35: fatal error: tf/transform_listener.h: No such file or directory
roscd tf works fine! So I don't know what's going wrong here.
Can someone help me please?
Edit: I've installed it from the Ubuntu binaries. It's fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04. I'm not at home but I think the other dependencies are roscpp and std_msgs

Did you install tf from Ubuntu binaries, or from source? What version of ROS are you using? On what platform?
Comment by Stephane.M on 2013-02-17:
And what others dependencies did you include ?

A:

Maybe you could try to add dependencies to : rospy and roscpp in your manifest.xml
Indeed, when you look at the tutorials broadcaster and listener, you see that the dependencies are :
 roscreate-pkg learning_tf tf roscpp rospy turtlesim

Let me know if it works,
Bests regards,
Steph
