A:

For the creation of new packages, you should build a sandbox (see section 2 in the overlays tutorial).
mkdir ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox

After resourcing your setup.bash, you can should be ablte to create new packages there withour errors:
cd ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
roscreate-pkg std_msgs rospy roscpp
