Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS Background

Hi All,
I have been working on ros for a few months now. I wish to know the basic building philosophy and the design of ROS to be able to

understand why / hows of ROS
to become a better programmer as such.

Is there anything online (I couldn't find any) which gives the very base level design structure in complete detail. I could go through the code and I have been doing that but any documentation on that would be quite helpful .
Thanks.
Neeraj
