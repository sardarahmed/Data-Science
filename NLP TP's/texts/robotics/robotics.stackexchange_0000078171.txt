Q:

Turtlebot NUC battery state

Hi community,
I'd like to use the turtlebot with a more powerful NUCi5 instead of a poor netbook.
The NUC has no /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1
Is it possible to replace it with simply setting:
export TURTLEBOT_BATTERY=/var/tmp/battery/BAT1
and write my own file for battery simulation/fake ?
Later I'd like to fill-up the content with real data from an attached external USB-ADC-Modul.
Which parameters/values are neccessary to make default turtlebot happy with the fake-setup ?
Any suggestions ?
Thanks for some feedback
Cheers
Christian

A:

If you'd like to setup a way to generate a battery status that would be interesting. Note that we've recently added support to disable the battery monitoring too: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/blob/kinetic/turtlebot_bringup/launch/minimal.launch#L21
