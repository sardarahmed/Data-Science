Q:

Groovy install in Ubuntu 14.04

Is it possible to install Groovy in Ubuntu 14.04 using the ROS repository, instead of compiling from source? I ask since most all of our code is in Groovy (rosmake) but the device running ROS requires Ubuntu 14.04 due to hardware drivers/configuration, etc.?
Thanks for all the help!

Dambrosio, hello.
I do not have an answer for you, but this was one of my objectives; to test groovy on 14,04. It is not a matter of working or not, but rather of being supported or not. So far, it is an unsupported platform, but go for it. If you have the means, test on a VM with 14.04.

A:

Well what do you know... Same question a few minutes earlier.

It helps to know what hardware/platform we are talking about. x86 installs and ARM have different statuses.

This is a AMD64 platform.

Would this be the link for installing from source: http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Source? I will step through this today and let you know what the outcome is. Thanks for the responses.

I got to step 2.1.2 Resolving Dependencies and ran into issues running: rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y
I get errors stating: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies. I tried to adding the --os. Any advice?

You probably ran into this issue? https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/4792
