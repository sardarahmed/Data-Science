Q:

Problem with depthimage_to_laserscan package

I am using depthimage_to_laserscan package. I use the command "rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan" to run the node. But It isn't printing anything to the /scan topic. Using rosnode command I see that it isn't subscribing to /camera/depth/image_raw topic. How do I make it do that?

A:

If you just run with rosrun, you'll need to remap the topics. Check the wiki page for the actual names that the node subscribes/publishes: http://wiki.ros.org/depthimage_to_laserscan
If your topic is /camera/depth/image_raw, then you'd want to run:
  rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan image:=camera/depth/image_raw
