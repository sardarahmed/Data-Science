Q:

How to modify the turtlebot robot model in rviz?

Hi,
I have remodeled my turtlebot with additional hardware to increase the height of the kinect location. I would like to model the same in rviz. I want to know which urdf file i should edit in order to do this. Any help here is much appreciated.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

The URDF file for the turtlebot is in the ros package turtlebot_description. It is loaded on the parameter server in turtlebot_bringup/minimal.launch. Please note that the package turtlebot_description will be read only. The best way to change it is to copy and rename it (make sure that you get the includes right in turtlebot.xacro).

Hi Lorenz, I cannot find turtlebot.xacro in Groovy. I'm using turtlebot2. I can find only turtlebot.urdf.xacro, and I'm confusing in rvizing it? Pls help me, thanks!
