Q:

shift in the map of gmapping

Hello everybody! This is a map in RVIZ.
we can see there is a shift from left to right in the map. The shift lead to a wrong result. I have been test the odometry data, it's ok. And the tf between /odom and /base_link is ok. Where would be the problem cause this wrong result?
Thank you for your attention.

A:

I make a experiment as follow.

the robot is static.
provide corridor laser information like this:

suppose the robot move following x-axis from (0, 0) as a speed 0.2m/s, and provide the odom data to simulate the process. In this case, the direction of the robot is always 0 degree.

However, the result is:

If the robot have enough time for running, the trajectory would be a circle.
Unbelievable!
