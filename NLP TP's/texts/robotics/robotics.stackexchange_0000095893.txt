Q:

setup.bash bad call with catkin_make_isolated

Hi ros org,
I have experienced a bad issue with catkin_make_isolated. The file devel_isolated/setup.bash is not source by .bashrc.
For the background:
I'm on Ubuntu 16.04, using ros kinetic. I had to reinstall Ubuntu few days ago (4 days but there was a weekend, so 2 days of use).
I uninstall and reinstall completely ros.
This is the content of the end of my bashrc file:
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
#source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/setup.bash
source ~/src/setup_px4.sh
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

As a result, source this file does not have any effect on my workspace. I can't launch any package
Therefore no problem from my package, sourcing myself the workspace is working well.
I just run the command, on the workspace root, catkin_make_isolated, and no compilation error.
Does anyone has a way to fix it? And also maybe underline what I might have done wrongly?

A:

This is the content of the end of my bashrc file:
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
#source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/setup.bash
source ~/src/setup_px4.sh
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

these lines are executed in sequence, one after the other.
When you source /path/to/setup.bash, the last one wins (ie: overwrites all the others).
So with the sequence you show, first /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash is sourced, then ~/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/setup.bash, then ~/src/setup_px4.sh and finally again /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash.
End result: as if only /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash was sourced.
You'll typically want to source /path/to/your/workspace/devel/setup.bash last.
Or, alternatively, don't auto-source anything in your .bashrc, but manually source ~/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/setup.bash when you start a terminal.
