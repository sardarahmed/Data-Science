Q:

PCB making at home

I've made many PCBs at home but still there are some mistakes. I tried ironing, drawing methods but it doesn't work very well. I use eagle CAD for design PCBs. Please help me. 

A:

A slightly better method for home-made PCBs is to mill the copper off of a two sided PCB.  Google pcb milling for many machines and services.
Another crazy idea that will probably get more affordable in the coming years is to use a 3D printer that can extrude conductive and non-conductive materials.
