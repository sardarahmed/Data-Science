Q:

MoveIt Tutorial - All Links at the same place!

Hello ROS-Community,
I am currently working my way through the MoveIt-GettingStarted Tutorial (https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html).
I do have installed Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic.
Everything works fine, until I try to add 'MotionPlanning' from the moveit_ros_visualization folder into my RViz.
All Links appear at the same place and it seems like there are no Joints loading.
I checked via rqt graph if my joint_state_publisher or my robot_state_publisher is not working. But regarding to rqt_graph both are actually working.
Any advice how I can fix that problem would be great.
Thansk alot!

Can you check whether this is another manifestation of the issue described in (among others) #q272692?

Sadly it doesnt help me yet.
I get an output which says "No active joints or end effectors found for group 'hand'. Make sure that kinematics.yaml is loaded in this node's namespace."
But actually i dont know how to fix it.

That's not really related. Ignore it for now.
What is the output of echo $LC_NUMERIC?
Comment by cluue on 2019-01-30:
The output of echo $LC_NUMERIC is en_US.UTF-8.
I did a mistake by not putting that to my .bashrc file. Now my joints work! Thanks a lot!
