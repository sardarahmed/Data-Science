Q:

How to find state-space representation of quadcopter?

I want to design a linear controller for a quadcopter which is 6dof nonlinear.
I have non-linear equations. But in order to design a linear controller, I need to find a linear state-space model of the vehicle.
I skimmed bunch of articles and thesis without any result. Most of them have some approximations for separate parts of the model to linearize.
I need the state-space as a form like below,
$$\dot{x}=Ax(t)+Bu(t)$$
I couldn't find the $A$ and $B$ matrices. I made the small angle and hover condition approximations so that equations become simpler yet they are still non-linear.
Non-simplified equations are as follow,

A:

State-space equations for your case.
