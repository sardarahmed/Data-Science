Q:

Laserscan bag to film

Hi everyone,
i'm looking for a method to automatically generate films from laserscan bags.
Important is that it's also possible to set the camera perspective.
So far i've been thinking about extracting PCD files, extracting images from the PCD file and stringing them together. But i didn't find any possibility to use my own camera perspective for taking the picture.
Does anyone have any idea how to do this? Except writing a hole new engine...
Does OpenCV maybe offer some useful methods for that?

A:

I'd try to do this with rviz. You could set camera views there (I'm not sure if it's possible programmatically).
To record this, I'd just do screencaps.
