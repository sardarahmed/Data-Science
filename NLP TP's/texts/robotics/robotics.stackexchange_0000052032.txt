Q:

Could not find Qt4

I was installing ROS-fuerte on Fedora 17 (64bit) when I encountered this issue. The error message says that it cannot find Qt4, though I did install it. Please help.
$>  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF

Just to make sure; you are following an instruction that's specifically designated for 17(&16) right?

A:

With the given error message, the issue doesn't seem to be rooted in ROS itself; instead I suspect that it's more about how Qt is installed.
Some links tell that you need to check (and add if necessary) if Qt is in environment variable:

HTH

Update 6/17/2013) Not yet sure the solution/workaround but the cause of the bizarre error might be that ros_tutorials/turtlesim/CMakeLists.txt:7 asks for Qt 4.6.
