Q:

Create node to receive data from OXTS imu

Hi,
I have an OXTS box basically a imu + gps. I have connected it through Ethernet port.
I'm fairly new to ROS and don't know how to create a UDP socket in ros to receive the data i.e the UDP broadcast from the OXTS.
Could someone please suggest where I should start?
Thanks

If the device is capable of outputting NMEA messages, you might be able to use any of the available NMEA compatible drivers (such as ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver).

A:

This following driver might work for you.

@b-sriram Hi, have you solved the problem? I tried this but it doesnt publish anything...
Comment by b-sriram on 2017-03-06:
Ya the problem was solved. Did you get any message like connected to RT3003v2 on the terminal when you run the node?
PS: First and foremost the OXTS has to be initialised
Comment by Bill5785 on 2017-03-06:
yeah I got like "connected to  at port (3000)". I checked the official website and it says initialize by speed > 5m/s. Have you done this? I cannt believe it because normally GPS can publish data whenever state it is...
Comment by b-sriram on 2017-03-06:
Its true if you use the GUI provided with OXTS. But to get NCOM packets it has to be initialised. Once initialised the node starts to publish all the data
Comment by Bill5785 on 2017-03-06:
Thank you very much! I will try that.@b-sriram
Comment by Bill5785 on 2017-03-06:
@b-sriram just want to make sure. Once initialized, do I need to always keep the speed > 5? If so, this doesnt make sense to me...
Comment by b-sriram on 2017-03-07:
Initializing once is enough. Then you'd be getting continuous output from the sensors

Hi @b-sriram, I met the same problem with @Bill5785. And I drove the car in a speed more than 10 m/s for at least 10 minutes. But I still can't get any message published from the topics. Did I miss anything? Thank you in advance for your help.
Comment by b-sriram on 2018-07-12:
Hi @msy is your Ethernet port configured properly? Are you on the same subnet as the OXTS?

I have similar questions. Did RT Range or RT 3000v1 work well with this driver. I see the driver is only tested with RT3000v2. Thank you for your reply in advance

@839977837wgj: do not post answers to ask a follow-up/related question. A comment is ok, but perhaps a new question might be better.
