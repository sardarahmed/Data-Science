Q:

DRCSIM: VRC is Black and Gold

I can understand why we would want Pittsburgh related Easter Eggs in all the VRC environments, but I am a little curious why the walls of the starting pens appear black with a yellow (gold?) stripe in the eyes of the robot. (Or at least the images as captured by the cameras).
Same for traffic cones, barrels, and the traffic sign. Wow, this is sweet, guys!
May I suggest an appropriate DRCSIM theme song? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_and_Yellow
Team Steel, Pittsburgh
Go Penguins
Go Steelers
Not so much, Pirates

A:

It's a bug of the "old" Gazebo. It's fixed in 1.5.
