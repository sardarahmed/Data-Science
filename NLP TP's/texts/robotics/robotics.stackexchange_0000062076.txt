Q:

How to set up People so that catkin_create_pkg can get the email address for -m and -a

When a package is generated using catkin_create_package -m "John Doe" -a "John Doe", the package.xml that is generated contains <author> and <maintainer> tags with @todo.todo email addresses.  Is there some config file somewhere that needs to be modified or an environment variable set or some usermod/groupadd step that needs to be run?

A:

Looking at the package template generator L82 -- No email is passed to the Person object constructor. No attempt is made to look it up on the system anywhere, either. Therefore, no, there is no setup step missing. The @todo.todo portions of the maintainer email and author email addresses must be replaced manually.

I'm sure the ROS team would welcome a pull request to improve this for your use case.

I agree. It requires a bit of discussion though:
My first instinct is to provide for a global dot file config similar to what git uses, except for using yaml as the markup language in the config file.
I would store it at $USER_HOME/.ros/config and create a catkin_pkg_config binary to set it up.
