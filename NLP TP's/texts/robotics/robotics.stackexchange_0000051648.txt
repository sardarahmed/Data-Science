i just changed the value of  to false in kinect.laucnh file  and it worked but i don't know if this is the right way to solve this problem, any suggestions ??

A:

Settint this value to false means that you won't have registered value and so that depth informations and color informations might not have the same coordinates. Hope that helps (even thought my answer comes late)
