Q:

Debug Messages in Gazebo 4?

I have a robot model that worked on Gazebo 2.2.3 on a different computer that I've been trying to port over to Gazebo 4. I copied the entire folder over to Gazebo 4's model directory and changed the SDF tags to 1.5 for both .sdf and .config files. For some reason, whenever I try to spawn the robot in Gazebo 4 through the menu, gzclient just terminates and gives me a generic "process has died" message. Is there somekind of debug model in Gazebo 4 that will allow me to determine what exactly is wrong with my model or Gazebo? I'm going to ask another question related to the Robot.
