Q:

How do I use rqt_plot to subscribe to std_msgs

I do have an Array from #include "std_msgs/Float64MultiArray.h" and it is constituted as followed:
layout: 
  dim: []
  data_offset: 0
data: [0.0073274714, -0.019451106, -0.009992006]
---

Now, if I use rqt_plot it does not show any data when selecting the topic. I cannot figure out why? If I hover over the + button in the GUI it just says no plottable fields.

Are you sure that empty dim field is correct? I wouldn't be surprised if rqt_plot cannot work with *Array msgs that have no valid dimensions associated with them.

how do I fill in the dim field? What i do so far is
      arr.data.clear();
    arr.data.push_back( x);
    arr.data.push_back( y);

A:

After having a look at this I figured it out as /Float64MultiArray/data[0] fo the first entry of the array with data being the array-name.
