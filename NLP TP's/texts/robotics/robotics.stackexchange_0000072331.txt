Q:

How do I publish the message to the rostopic /turtlesim/pose so that the turtle goes to the origin?

kv@kv:~$ rostopic pub -1 /turtle1/pose turtlesim/Pose -- ['0.0','0.0','0.0','2.0','0.0']
ERROR: Not enough arguments:
 * Given: [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0]]
 * Expected: ['x', 'y', 'theta', 'linear_velocity', 'angular_velocity']

Args are: [x y theta linear_velocity angular_velocity]

A:

Two part answer:

You are publishing incorrectly. The command should be something like:
rostopic pub --once /turtle1/pose turtlesim/Pose "{x: 0.0, y: 0.0, theta: 0.0, linear_velocity: 0.0, angular_velocity: 0.0}"

You cannot teleport the turtle by publishing to the pose topic. You need to use a service call:
rosservice call /turtle1/teleport_absolute ... # Use tab-tab and it will auto-fill the '...'

Thanks..that worked!
How can I generate trajectory for the turtle to move between two given co-ordinates?

You would need to write a planner/controller to do that. Or use one of the existing ones. I highly recommend you (at least) skim through most of the ROS tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials and http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials
