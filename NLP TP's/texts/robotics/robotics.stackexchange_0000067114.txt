Q:

Catkin_Ws or Root

Hello dear Users
I have a Catkin Workspace. I have installed a package called Universal_Robot. After installing it i wanted to modify the launch files so when i launch it and when the robot spawns into Gazebo it should load up the world i have created with the model builder in Gazebo. The problem is that the files i have modified are saved in the root, /opt/ros/indigo/share/...ur10.launch for example. Is it possible to do the same modification but not on the root, however in the Catkin_Ws!
Thnank you very much!

A:

In that case, you have to install the package in your catkin workspace (Catkin_Ws).You can download the source code and build the package in your catkin workspace and then modify the launch files which you want.
