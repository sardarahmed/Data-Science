Q:

Creating a ROS msg

I was following the steps of the tutorial "Creating a ROS msg and srv"
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv
and the step 3 I got this message:
Unable to load msg [beginner_tutorials/Num]: Cannot locate message [unit8] in package [beginner_tutorials] with paths [['/home/spyros/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg', '/home/spyros/catkin_ws/devel/share/beginner_tutorials/msg']]

At the step 2.1  how can I know if these two lines are uncommented ? Do I have to open the package.xml file with the editor as I did with the CMakeLists.txt?
After I finish editing the CMakeLists.txt file, do I have to save it with the same name?
I followed the similar steps for Creating a srv and the result in step 4.2 was correct.
I am using ROS kinetic.
I am running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

step 3 didn't work normally

What does this mean? What happened, what errors did you get? Please update your question with this information.

I updated my question with the message I got. I tried again with the same results.

Yes, you have to open the xml file using any text editor and uncomment those lines. Usually for xml files, comments are between <!--  and -->. So, just make sure that is not the case.

After I finish editing the CMakeLists.txt file, do I have to save it with the same name?

Yes, that is necessary as it enables you to run catkin_make correctly (without errors).

Unable to load msg [beginner_tutorials/Num]: Cannot locate message [unit8] in package [beginner_tutorials] with paths [['/home/spyros/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg', '/home/spyros/catkin_ws/devel/share/beginner_tutorials/msg']]

This error can be solved by correcting unit8 to uint8.

I tried the tutorial again and I have the same problem. At the step 3 I got the message:
Unable to load msg [beginner_tutorials/Num]: Cannot locate message [unit8] in package [beginner_tutorials] with paths [['/home/spyros/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg', '/home/spyros/catkin_ws/devel/share/

unit8 is not a message type, so that error is understandable. Should it be uint8? And that is not a message, but a primitive type.
Comment by akshayk07 on 2018-06-01:
Yes, it should be uint8.
Comment by Spyros on 2018-06-01:
Yes. That was my mistake. I changed it to uint8 and I got the correct result in the command
rosmsg show beginner_tutorials/Num
Thank you!
