Q:

Is there a way to merge bag files?

I have data across multiple bag files, but I don't care about absolute timestamps, just relative time. I would like to merge the separate bag files into one bag file. For example, if I was recording images to a bag file, then later recorded more images to a different bag file, I would like to combine these bag files into a single one. Right now, I am playing them back and recording them into another bag file, but this seems clunky.

https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/downloads/support/merge_bag.py doesn't do the time offsetting but does merge two or more bag files

A:

You can checkout the rosbag Code API and associated cookbook  you should be able to do exactly what you want pretty quickly.

Thanks! I ended up doing just that. I just felt like there should be a nice way to merge two bag files with the same topics. I can see this being helpful for many different types of data. Something like rosbag merge *.bag /topic
