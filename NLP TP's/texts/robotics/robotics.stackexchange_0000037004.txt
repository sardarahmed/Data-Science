Q:

hokuyo_listener_cu_missing_library

Hi to everybody
I am now trying the application using ROS (Robot Operative System).
I found  "hokuyo_listener_cu" node source code.
in the code there is a library called  "PointCloudWithOrigin.h"
"#include "hokuyo_listener_cu/PointCloudWithOrigin.h""
I can not find the library anywhere, I supposed that it could be here,
http://code.google.com/p/prairiedog/source/browse/trunk/hokuyo_listener_cu/?r=65#hokuyo_listener_cu%2Fsrc
but it is not.
I am just wondering where can I find it.
And thank you very much for your help :)

A:

The PointCloudWithOrigin.h is automatically generated from PointCloudWithOrigin.msg using the `rosmake [node_to_make' command (this is how ROS does all message data structures, see http://www.ros.org/wiki/Messages
