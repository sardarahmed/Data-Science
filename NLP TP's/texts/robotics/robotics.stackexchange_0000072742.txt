Q:

Node that generates key or mouse events at low level?

I'd like to generate keyboard and mouse presses at the X11 level, so applications or even other ros nodes that are reading the keyboard directly can be tested or remotely controlled.

I'll make one if it doesn't already exist.

https://github.com/ros-visualization/robhum_ui_utils/tree/master/virtual_keyboard - but is using subprocess rather than libxdo

A:

https://github.com/lucasw/xdo_ros - currently takes String inputs for key down, up, or key strings, and mouse absolute position and relative moves using opencv_apps/Point2D messages.  Needs a window selection service, it only uses the current window now.
