Q:

ros2 lifecycle state transition topics

I have created a rclpy node and an associated *launch.py file.
I use ros2 launch "package" "launch file" to launch the node, and I see it successfully start.  Embedding prints in the code seem to indicate that the node is taking lifecycle state transitions.  However, I cannot query the lifecycle state.
I modeled my launch file after the Stereolabs zed node launch file.  Is there an all-python managed node example that uses controlled state transitions for reference?
Thanks

Unless something has changed recently, managed nodes are currently a C++-only feature.
The ROS 2 Features page seems to confirm that, as as well as check of the ros2/rclpy repository.
