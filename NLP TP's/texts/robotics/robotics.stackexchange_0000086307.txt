A:

There are 2 ways to do this:

If you have ROS installed in the place, where you are going to run Tk program, you can simply use rospy Subscribers to subscribe to topics, where you will get the data.
If you want to run the Tk program in an OS, which doesn't have ROS, you can convert the messages to JSON format using rosbridge_suite and then use generic python packages to convert JSON to be compatible with your Tk package.
