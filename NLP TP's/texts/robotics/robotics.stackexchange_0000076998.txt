Q:

Unable to find ros-indigo-gazebo7-ros-pkgs

I have just installed ROS Indigo, along with Gazebo 7 from the separate Gazebo site. According to this page, Using a specific Gazebo version with ROS, I should be able to install ros-pkgs from Debian with (I believe) the following name: ros-indigo-gazebo7-ros-pkgs.
However, I cannot find this package. I believe I already added the OSR Foundation packages, but perhaps I did not do it correctly. I have
http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable trust main

in my repository list (I am running Ubuntu trusty). Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong, or where this package is located?

A:

Is that line in your "repository list" an actual copy/paste? Because the distribution name is trusty, not trust (note the y).
