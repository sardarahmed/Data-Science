Q:

viso2 gets lost unless in fast motion

Hi
I am trying to use viso2 (https://github.com/srv/viso2) for visual odometry. I have the following setup:

Kinect camera
Openni driver (https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_launch)
TF-Transform between base_link and kinect_link, so that it is in the optical frame
Starting viso2 with https://github.com/ct2034/auckbot/blob/master/auckbot_navigation/launch/viso2_demo_mono.launch

The behavior that I am seeing is that most of the time the got_lost flag is set (in the /mono_odometer/info topic).
And also the pose is not updated. But when I move the camera really fast, the flag changes for one frame or so and the pose changes.
Is this a problem of setup? But there doesn't seem to be a parameter that influences this.

Are your images rectified?

A:

For a kinect I would recommend you use fovis VO. With it you will take advantage of the depth image and get better results than only with a monocular visual odometer.
