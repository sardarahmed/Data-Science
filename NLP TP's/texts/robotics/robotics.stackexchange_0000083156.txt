Q:

Web-server-video remote access

Hi,
I'm trying to access the web-video-server. I got it to work on localhost, the url in the doc works and everything is fine. However I can't access it remotely ( on a different laptop on the same network) or from a remote connection.
(Note that my router gives me a ipv6 address, I tried http://[myip]:8080 without success ).
What is the best way to get my camera to stream on a webbrowser that is remote ? Should I use port forwarding ?

Edit:  Thanks !
My router gives me an IPV6 by default, I haven't been able to switch to IPV4. Also I sort of want to be able to do this accross different network ( depending on where the robot is connected to wifi) without requiring a specific setup ( like forcing a static IP)
I'm not sure what's the best way for this, maybe setting up a VPN...

I am able to access the steam on a different laptop, same network, using IPv4. Have you tried that?
