Q:

Problem in wiimote_node.py

Hello,
i have a problem when i start the wiimote_node with rosrun wiimote wiimote_node.py. I get the following error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "wiimote_node.py", line 100, in 
import wiimote.WIIMote
File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/joystick_drivers/wiimote/src/wiimote/WIIMote.py", line 48, in 
import cwiid
ImportError: /opt/ros/electric/stacks/joystick_drivers/cwiid/cwiid/lib/libcwiid.so.1: undefined symbol: clock_gettime
has anyone encountered the problem yet? I'm running out of ideas.
My os is ubuntu 11.10 32-bit

can you include what version of joystick drivers you have installed (look at the CMakeLists.txt in joystick_drivers).. I just installed the latest from the package manager (1.6.4) and ran it and it worked.

A:

Yes I have had the same problem.
It is the libcwiid that comes with ROS Electric that is the problem. You can solve it be doing the following:
install libcwiid1 and libcwiid-dev with synaptic or apt.
go to
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/joystick_drivers/cwiid/cwiid/lib/
remove or rename
libcwiid.so
libcwiid.so.1
libcwiid.so.1.0
Create the following symbolic links with “sudo ln -s”
libcwiid.so -> /usr/lib/libcwiid.so
libcwiid.so.1 -> /usr/lib/libcwiid.so.1
libcwiid.so.1.0 -> /usr/lib/libcwiid.so.1.0
example: sudo ln -s libcwiid.so /usr/lib/libcwiid.so
This will solve your problem.

Had same issue while using wiimote in ROS Electric. The provided solution solved the problem. Also the symbolic link command should be "sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libcwiid.so libcwiid.so"
