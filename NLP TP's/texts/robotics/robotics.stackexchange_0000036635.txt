Q:

couldn't find dependency [hogman_minimal] of [rgbdslam]

I want to install rgbdslam(http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam) and let it work.
When I execute rosmake --rosdep-install rgbdslam, it has error message as follows:

cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rospack find rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
[rosbuild] Building package rgbdslam
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/rospack deps-manifests rgbdslam
[rospack] couldn't find dependency [hogman_minimal] of [rgbdslam]
[rospack] missing dependency
CMake Error at /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:113 (message):
Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package 'rgbdslam'.  Look
above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the broken
dependency!
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:183 (rosbuild_invoke_rospack)
CMakeLists.txt:31 (rosbuild_init)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

How can I solve it? Thanks for your help.

A:

You have to install the hogman_minimal package. Use this command:
svn checkout http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/freiburg_tools/hogman_minimal

This can be found in the rgbdslam tutorials.
EDIT: Run the following commands.
roscd hogman_minimal
rosmake
