Q:

why no such directory "sensor_msgs"

Hi, everyone! I am using mit-ros-pkg "hand detection". I met a problem and then I checked the directory and files. I found that there should be a directory "sensor_msgs" while I do not I have. Help! Thank you!

thank you very much. that works.

A:

Generally, you should always provide an exact error message and which ROS version you are using (see here for support guidelines).
I assume that the error is not because a missing directory but because you are missing the ros package sensor_msgs. To get it, install the stack common_msgs. If you are using ROS Fuerte, do
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-common-msgs

If you are using ROS Electric, do
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-common-msgs
