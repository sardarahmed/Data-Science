Q:

rosversion ros returns 

Hi,
I just installed ROS Fuerte using the debian pkgs (desktop-full install) on a Ubuntu Precise (64 bit).
I tried to install some packages that check the version of ROS installed.
(using roslib.stacks.get_stack_version('ros'))
But rosversion ros returns <unversioned> and not 1.8.7, which is present in the /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/stack.yaml file. rosversion -d returns fuerte correctly.
My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set correctly.
Any idea how to fix the problem or what is causing this?
Thank you all!
Nick

A:

This is a bug in the current fuerte debian packages. It's been "fixed" but hasn't rolled out yet for some reason.
See this ticket: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3987
