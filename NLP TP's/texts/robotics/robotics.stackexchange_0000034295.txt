Q:

rosjava.jar missing certain packages

I got rosjava.jar from delbian packages, in the dist folder. But when I use this as a reference lib in eclipse, I realise certain packages like org.ros.node and org.ros.android are missing.
Can someone please explain how I could solve this problem?

A:

org.ros.android comes from the rosjava.android packages (http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/source/checkout?repo=android).  The other missing jars are most likely built when you build the rosjava package.  The manifest.xml file of a package specifies dependencies and when you run "rosmake" on the package it will generate the jar files for each of those dependencies.
I recommend installing rosjava and rosjava.android from source.  Here's (hopefully) a helpful guide:

Install ROS electric, unstable, or later
a.  ‘sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full’ (for electric)

Clone the latest rosjava source from googlecode into a directory in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Install Mercurial (hg) : ‘sudo apt-get install hg’

Go to http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/source/checkout and Follow “Command-line access” instructions

Run ‘rospack profile’ to update your environment

Build rosjava
‘rosmake rosjava’

Continue for Andorid setup

Install eclipse
‘sudo apt-get install eclipse’

Install the Andorid SDK
Follow the instructions at http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Clone the latest rosjava.android source from googlecode into a directory in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Go to http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/source/checkout?repo=android and Follow “Command-line access” instructions

Run ‘rospack profile’ to update your environment

Build rosjava.android
‘rosmake rosjava.android’

From here you should have a working environment.  To run the tutorials, run "rosmake" on the one you want, then import it into eclipse.  If you're doing Android dev you may need to import android_gingerbread or android_honeycomb_mr2 into eclipse also, and add them as project references.
android_gingerbread and android_honeycomb_mr2 are the packages (eclipse projects) that provide org.ros.rosjava.android.
To create a new rosjava package you can follow the instructions here : http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava/Build
The only difference for android is that the build.xml file should be :
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project>
  <property file="ros.properties"/>
  <include file="${ros.pkg.rosjava_bootstrap.dir}/android.xml"/>
</project>

You'll also need to set up the right exports.  Add this to your manifest.xml file:
<export>
  <rosjava-android-lib target="android-9" />
  <rosjava-src location="src" />
  <rosjava-src location="gen" />
  <rosjava-src location="res" />
</export>

After running rosmake you should be able to import your the package into eclipse and begin development.
