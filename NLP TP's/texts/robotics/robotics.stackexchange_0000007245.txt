Q:

How many quadcopters would it take to lift a burrito?

I am investigating a possible business opportunity in which quadcopters perform high-precision nutritional delivery via a burrito medium. I have never used a burrito, but I have read on the internet that they typically weigh 600-700 grams (1). This is much too heavy for commercially available platforms.
How many quadcopters would it take to lift a single burrito?

A:

One.
Here's my quadcopter lifting a burrito, and lowering it using an onboard winch, in 2013. Built from the cheap commercially available X-aircraft x650v4 kit, except I replaced the ESCs and the flight controller (I think that's an APM 1.0 on there).
A rule of thumb in multirotor design is that you should be able to hover at 50% throttle. This means that a quadcopter which can fly well at 1kg total weight will actually be able to get off the ground at around 2kg, but you'll have lost almost any ability to control attitude or position.
The winch is built from a servo and a fishing reel. Happy to provide more details.
