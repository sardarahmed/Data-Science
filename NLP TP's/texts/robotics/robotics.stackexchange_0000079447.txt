A:

I'm not sure what you mean by a C++ workspace, but you are free to mix and match different languages within the same package and workspace. Nodes written in different languages can communicate via topics and services (for the most part, I haven't yet encountered any limitations/problems). In fact, I do this all the time. I'll often write some nodes in Python and some in C++ and there's never an issue.

catkin make is different for python and c++. I do require some packages in python and c++ as well by making sure that both are compiled on similar and integrated  build environment,

catkin_make will only compile C++, in fact, you don't compile Python at all. You can use packages built with Python and packages built with C++ in the same workspace without any problems, except in very rare circumstances. You can also use Python and C++ in the same package.
