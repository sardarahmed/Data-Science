Q:

What is the purpose of the beginner tutorials? I'm following them but I'm not sure what I am doing or why

http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_rosbuild_with_catkin
This is where I am and I am sort of familiar with linux, I managed to install a few different distros to this machine. I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial), Kinetic Kame ROS, and trying to get Gazebo working.
Its just not clear to me why I have to do all of this... I'd like to jump right into building robotics simulations.

Observation: you've tagged this ros2 and xenial, but then link to the Catkin tutorials, which are ROS 1 only.
Could you clarify?

A:

Topics, Services, Parameters, and catkin (the build system) are all prerequisites for building and controlling ROS robots.
If you want a better overview of how all of these things are used in a robotics simulation environment, take a look at the turtlesim tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim/Tutorials
If you specifically want to use gazebo, you may also want to look at the gazebo tutorials: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials
