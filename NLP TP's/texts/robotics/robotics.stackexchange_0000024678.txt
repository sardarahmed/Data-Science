Q:

Drifting issue in ROS2 using SLAM-Toolbox

I'm slightly new to robotics and I'm trying to prototype using ROS2-Galactic, I am using built-in packages such as Slam Toolbox and others.
Now that I'm trying to run it, I'm having some issues with the created map as well in tf perhaps. I don't know how to point out where I am getting the problem, I am completely noob to debugging this stuff. the scenario is, I'm trying to do SLAM and I put the robot in-place without doing nothing, but it seems that the robot is rotating clockwise by its own as shown in rviz.
I hope someone is interested to help me, you can check clip here,

A:

Beyond the fact that the robot's not moving, so I can't know if there are other TF issues, the most obvious problem I see is that you're not using a laser scanner. This is a 2D laser scanner SLAM method. It needs 2D laser scanner like angular data coverage. You're not going to get away with RGBD sensors unless you integrated 2-3 of them to get a reasonable angular band to scan match against.
If you have an RGBD sensor, there are specialized RGB-D SLAM's or visual SLAMs that exist that you should utilize. We're not in 2010 anymore where there aren't many or good options for RGBD cameras.
