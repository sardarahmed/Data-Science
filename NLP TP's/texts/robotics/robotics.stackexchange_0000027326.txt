Q:

Want to install gazebo5 but has ROS indigo installed

I want to install Gazebo5. But I have already installed ROS indigo which provides Gazebo2 instead. I think this is because Gazebo2 works well with ROS indigo(am I right?).So if I want to install Gazebo5 I have to remove Gazebo2. Now the problem is I am not sure whether I can use Gazebo5 to communicate with ROS or not? Specifically, I want to use the ROS message mechanism in Gazebo5 as well, does ROS indigo support Gazebo 5?
Thanks for any suggestion.

A:

In order to have Gazebo5 with ROS Indigo you have to uninstall first the gazebo2 packages that ROS Indigo installed (ros-indigo-gazebo-*)
Then add the osrf repositories to your Linux package manager and follow the command provided by Jose Luis Rivero here
I'm using Gazebo5 with ROS and it works fine. When I installed it, I remember there was one of the ros-indigo-gazebo5-* packages that was not installed by default.
Just check that all your ros-indigo-gazebo5-* packages are installed.
