Q:

dynamic_reconfigure parameters not known until runtime. How?

As I understand it, the dynamic_reconfigure requires a .cfg file to specify the parameters that will be used (and I've used this successfully, both C and python).
I'm working on a GenICam camera driver, and can't know which parameters the camera supports until runtime.  Hence I can't make a .cfg file since I don't know what the parameters will be.  Is there a way to use dynamic_reconfigure, but to set up the parameter specs after we've queried the camera?  Thanks.

A:

Actually, some dynamic reconfigure improvements did land into Groovy thanks to Ben Ballard.  However, without a clear maintainer, these were not documented.
Here's an example usage of updating the limits at runtime:
