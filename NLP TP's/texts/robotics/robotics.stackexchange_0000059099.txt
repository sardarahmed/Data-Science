Q:

Does ROS support proxy connections between client/server?

Dear ROS Community,
Does ROS support proxy connections (like SOCKS) between client/server (to get through firewalls/VPNs)?
Thanks,
Aaron

This seems like a must have for any TCP/IP connection. Does anybody else feel this way if it is not currently implemented?

A:

ROS does not currently support any kind of native tunneling across firewalls.
There are a few proxy nodes and bridge/aggregation nodes such as rosproxy and rosbridge that can proxy multiple topics and services from one ROS master to another, across a single TCP port; I've seen people use these to cross firewall and network boundaries.
I've also seen a number of solutions that use VPN to cross firewalls.

Thanks Austin,
I see a need for this, and I am going to add proxy support to the Happy Artist Java based ROS Client.
