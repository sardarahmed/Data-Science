Q:

Computing Yaw angle from position and velocities

I have an object to whom I know the x,y,z position, length, width, height, and x,y velocities. Is there a possibility to compute the yaw angle from this information?  

A:

if you mean by the "x,y,z positions and x,y velocities" just for one point of the object for example: The Mass Center or The Geometrical Center so the answer is No it is not possible, because it's possible for any point of the object to have any value for this parameters "x,y,z positions and x,y velocities" for different Yaw angles
but if you have another constrain or information about the object it may become possible to compute the yaw angle from this information
