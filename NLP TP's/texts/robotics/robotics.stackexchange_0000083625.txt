Could you please attach the image you linked to in your comment to your question directly? I've give you enough karma to do so.

A:

It's all on the documentation here:
http://wiki.ros.org/move_base
The scheme itself (taken from there) would be:

@pietrocolombo: that is a flow chart diagram, which is something different from a 'functionality scheme' (which is a bit ambiguous in any case).
