Q:

How to find list of messages published on particular topic?

I am using turtlebot in gazebo which uses "scan" message for publishing laser scan data, by using rostopic type scan command I can find out type of the message i.e. sensor_msgs/LaserScan , Is there way to find names of all the messages published on particular topic ?
For example, Is there any way to find out that message named "scan" is published by turtlebot knowing only the topic name i.e. sensor_msgs/LaserScan ?
Thanks in advance.

I'm a little confused. Scan is the topic name, sensor_msgs/LaserScan is the message type. Are you asking if there is a way to search for topic names based on message type?

Also, only one type of message can be published to a particular topic.

A:

If you are trying to do what I think you are, find all of the topics publishing or subscribing sensor_msgs/LaserScan messages, then the answer is yes. Enter rostopic find sensor_msgs/LaserScan in a terminal window and it will list the topics using the sensor_msgs/LaserScan message.

@Icehawk : Thanks. That's exactly what I needed. Sorry for poor wording.

Not a problem. The nomenclature takes a bit of getting used to. Every time I write a paper or document about ROS the first section is always a glossary :P
