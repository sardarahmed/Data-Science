Q:

sbpl on Hydro compilation error

Dear all.
I just compiled navigation_experimental-hydro-devel with catkin-make in ROS hydro. However, it does not compile due to changes in costmap2d.
Just wondering if there might be any patches or some solution to make sbpl compile in hydro.
In advance thank you.

Hi, thank you very much for your answer, I have solved the issues with unicycleplussidewaysplusbackturn.mprim, however I have another issue, Sometimes it get stuck when it gets trap in inflated obstacles even though there is enough space around the robot.
I found the package sbpl_recovery in this site thttps://github.com/ros-planning/navigation_experimental/tree/hydro-devel/sbpl_recovery  hat I think it could help to recover when the robot gets trap. But the package does compile under Hydro due to changes in costmap2d. Or is there some other solution.

A:

Johannes Meyer and I both have branches of the sbpl_lattice_planner that compile and run on Hydro:

Johannes's: https://github.com/meyerj/sbpl_lattice_planner
Mine: https://github.com/trainman419/sbpl_lattice_planner

Thank you very much, I download it and then I could compile it under hydro, just one question; is it possible to test the package with the launch file  sbpl_lattice_planner move_base_sbpl_fake_localization_2.5cm.launch or in other words, how can I test the package?

Or maybe you may have a launch file to take a look at it :), I mean how to include sbpl_lattice_planner in the navigation stack

My application and the setup is a little bit messy. I don't really have time to explain it, but my top-level launch file is https://github.com/trainman419/dagny_nav/blob/master/dagny_nav_launch/dagny_nav.launch .

thank you very much, however dont you need some hoe run the package "sbpl_lattice_planner"   or where you get <param name="SBPLLatticePlanner/primitive_filename"?

I don't have time to explain it. Go read the nav stack docs.

@acp: You need to set "base_global_planner" parameter to "SBPLLatticePlanner" - planner will be loaded at runtime. It's same as with other planners - you don't need to run them separately. See this: https://github.com/trainman419/dagny_nav/blob/master/dagny_nav_launch/dagny_nav.yaml

@acp: i also compiled that stack with catkin_make in  hydro, got two errors.  (no exist SBPLLatticePlannerStats.h and changes in costmap2d),how do you clean those files   built by   catkin_make navigation_experimental-hydro-devel ,and  downloaded "Johannes's"or "ahendrix's" to catkin_make??
