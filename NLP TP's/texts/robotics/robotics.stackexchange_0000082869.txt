Q:

Do services in ros 2 require a seperate .srv file?

I was reading this tutorial where they have created a service based server/client for adding two integers.However, they have not created the .srv files as required in ROS 1. Is it possible to mention the service type without creating the .srv files ?

A:

ROS 2 still requires a proper .srv file, but in the case of the tutorial you link the authors are reusing an existing definition.
You can find that one in the ros2/example_interfaces repository (specifically: ros2/example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts.srv).
Note that the tutorial you link to was (as far as I can tell) quite some time ago already. ROS 2 is still being developed, so pay attention while following the steps, as things could have changed (significantly).
