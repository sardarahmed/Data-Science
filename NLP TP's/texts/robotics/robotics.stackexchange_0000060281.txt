Q:

Cannot add or delete files from opt/ros/hydro/share

I am trying to add some files to the location /opt/ros/hydro/share. But I am being denied permission. I have installed ROS as a debian package.

A:

You should not put any files in that location. If you are developing your own nodes, create a ros workspace where you have permission to write (see  http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace). If you for some reason still want to add files to /opt/ros just use sudo cp.

Let me phrase it more strictly: If one tries to add files to /opt and does not understand why it says: Permission denied, one should under no circumstance sudo cp files in there as that will very likely lead to ugly problems.
