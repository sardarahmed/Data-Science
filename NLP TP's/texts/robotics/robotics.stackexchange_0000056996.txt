Q:

error with hector quadrotor tutorial

Hi guys!
I've followed the ROS tutorial: "Quadrotor indoor SLAM demo", step by step, (I think) and at the end, when I write the last command,(roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo indoor_slam_gazebo.launch), I get this:
[indoor_slam_gazebo.launch] is neither a launch file in package [hector_quadrotor_demo] nor is [hector_quadrotor_demo] a launch file name
Somebody knows why?
Thanks

A:

you must set the ROS_PACKAGE__PATH enviroment variable.
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:(yours path)
