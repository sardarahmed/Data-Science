Q:

Suppress TF_REPEATED_DATA warnings?

I've read the discussions on why this warning is being printed but that's not really relevant to me. I'm trying to play back an old rosbag which published a TF repeatedly with the same timestamp. I only need the TF once so I don't care that the rest of the messages are ignored but I keep getting the message
Warning: TF_REPEATED_DATA ignoring data with redundant timestamp for frame...
spamming my terminal making debugging other parts of my code impossible. So my question is how can I stop this message? I've tried changing the logging levels but loading a custom rosconsole file but there was no change. Here is the file I make:
#
#   rosconsole will find this file by default at $ROS_ROOT/config/rosconsole.config
#
#   You can define your own by e.g. copying this file and setting
#   ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE (in your environment) to point to the new file
# log4j.logger.ros=ERROR log4j.logger.ros.roscpp.superdebug=ERROR

A:

You can run a version of geometry2 that reduces the warning by cloning this repo and branch in your catkin_ws/src:
git clone --branch throttle-tf-repeated-data-error git@github.com:BadgerTechnologies/geometry2.git

Then rebuild, source setup.bash, run and then it should be reduced down to once every 10 seconds.  If 10 seconds is still too much log output then change the ros::Duration(10.0) to 10000 seconds or whatever you like.

I haven't actually run that branch but it looks reasonable that it will work as claimed.

I can confirm that this works.

Thank you! This worked like a charm. Ideally there would be a way to set the time delay without having to re-compile but for now this is great.
