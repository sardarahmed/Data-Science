Q:

usb_cam on imac isight: "No space left on device"

Fresh install of diamondback and Lucid in VirtualBox on my mac, I installed usb_cam (bosch-drivers), but get the following error when running:
VIDIOC_STREAMON error 28, No space left on device
I get a similar error when I try to run guvcview.
Any advice on resolving this issue?  Is it a virtual machine problem?

How much space is on your virtual machine.  Try running 'df -h' in your console, and posting the results.

A:

What else is attached and running on your USB bus? This error typically means you have exceeded the bus capacity (for instance I frequently had this issue when attempting to access two high resolution webcam images when playing with stereo vision).
