I first tried to run it on 12.04. I copy the source code for 12.04 in but it said there was missing packages when I tried to update. I tried it on 13.04 but I got the same problem

A:

Are you compiling from source? Compiling from source is not for the faint of heart...have you tried the Debian packages following the instructions at http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu ?
