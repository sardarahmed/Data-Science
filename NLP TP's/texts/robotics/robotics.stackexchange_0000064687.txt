Q:

Cannot specify link libraries for target "pluginlib_utest"

I'm building ROS on Yosemite and have built 72/196 packages successfully after a bit of debugging. Now I am stumped at this error:
-- catkin 0.5.89
-- Boost version: 1.56.0
-- Found the following Boost libraries:
--   filesystem
--   system
CMake Warning at /Users/kal04p/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/catkin/cmake/test/gtest.cmake:29 (message):
  skipping gtest 'pluginlib_utest' in project 'pluginlib'
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:35 (catkin_add_gtest)

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:36 (target_link_libraries):
  Cannot specify link libraries for target "pluginlib_utest" which is not
  built by this project.

A:

This was fixed by brew install gtest. Hopefully useful for future visitors.
