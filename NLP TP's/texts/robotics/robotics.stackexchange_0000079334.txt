A:

This is a known issue, see ros-planning/moveit#86.
ros-planning/moveit#450 should presumably fix this, but I'm not sure whether that has been released yet. If not, building the moveit_commander package from source (in your Catkin workspace) works (note that you probably only need that particular package in your workspace).

Yes, the fix is not yet released. I opened a release request.

Has this bug been fixed? I still cannot import moveit_commander on Ubuntu 16.04 and pyassimp 3.2
I have seen ros-planning/moveit#450 #86, yet I didn't find some useful solution.
could you give me a detailed advice on handling with terminal?
PS: I have built the moveit_commander package from source.
