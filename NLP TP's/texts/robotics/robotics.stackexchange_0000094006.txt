Q:

Customizing Turtlebot3: opencr position

I am trying to customize turtlebot3. I moved opencr in other place on robot's base, not the center. Here is my questions:

Since imu is located on opencr, Does it have affect to odom data? Or does imu data have affect to odometry data?

If it does, which part of opencr code should I modificate to get odom data correct? I mean "/odom" topic.

A:

I have found that place in opencr code, where imu have affect to odometry.
I decided to move opencr as it was located by default, on the center between wheels, instead of changing code in opencr.
