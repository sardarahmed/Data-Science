Q:

Internal Server Error ROS Wiki

I'm getting a Internal Server Error when editing/try to access the wiki-page: http://ros.org/wiki/amigo_gazebo . I guess it's the same problem as:http://answers.ros.org/question/12315/getting-an-internal-server-error-while-editing-the-roswiki/ . Can somebody perhaps restore this page? Thanks, Rein

A:

Fixed. You had non-ascii characters inside of a section marked with
{{{
#!clearsilver CS/NodeAPI

Which caused the page renderer to throw a stack trace and die. Using the preview button before saving a page should help detect this in the future, so that you can correct it before it becomes permanent.
