Q:

Understanding ros 2 navigation stack, white papers and software architecture sketches would help

Hi,
I would like to understand the ROS 2 navigation stack and perhaps help in its development.
I am hoping if someone could suggest any white paper's/books on which it is based on. Also, Is there any documentation/sketches on the software architecture.

The repository that you link to is not the "ROS 2 navigation stack" if I understand everything correctly. It seems to be a (quick) port of the "ROS 1 navigation stack" to use ROS 2 infrastructure (it was used as a demo/test case for the state of ROS 2 quite a few months ago).
As such, the design is probably relatively similar to how it was in ROS 1.
The effort to implement a proper ROS 2 based navigation stack may be found at: ros-planning/navigation2.
The design documentation (and other documentation) for that may be found at: ros-planning/navigation2/doc (NOTE: I'm using a permalink here. If you're clicking this link in the future, make sure to read an up-to-date version of the documentation, not this old one).
