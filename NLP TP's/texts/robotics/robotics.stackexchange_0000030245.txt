Are there any ROS tools to help me track down circular dependencies between my ROS nodes?

As a follow up, I thought i had a circular dependency in my packages because when i call rosmake with a few of my stacks, i see this message: [rospack] woah! expanding the dependency tree made it blow up.

A:

Note that dependencies are between packages or stacks, not nodes.
To list the dependencies of a package named foo:
$ rospack depends foo

To list the packages that depend on foo (directly or indirectly):
$ rospack depends-on foo
