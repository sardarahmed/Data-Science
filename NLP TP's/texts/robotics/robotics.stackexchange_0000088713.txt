Q:

What are the dimensions of the generic quadrotor in the hector quadrotor package?

Hello,
The description page (http://wiki.ros.org/hector_quadrotor_description) talks about quadrotor_hokuyo_utm30lx.urdf.xacro providing the description but I am a little bit confused reading the file, where specifically or under which tag do I find the dimensions. By dimensions I mean the height, rotor radius, weight, max distance from the center etc.

A:

Geometry is defined by the meshes in the hector_quadrotor_description/meshes/quadrotor folder. The blender, .stl and .dae files all contain the same geometry, just in different formats. Easiest option to look at is probably the .stl file, this can be opened/imported with many tools. You can even view it online on github.
Inertial parameters are defined via the respective tags in the URDF/xacro files. For the basic quadrotor you can look at line 11 in quadrotor_base.urdf.xacro.

Thank you Stefan for your quick response. I think I got the values I needed. One final question: Are all the units in SI units?  So those values would be (kg*m^2)
