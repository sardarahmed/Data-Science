A:

This is most likely a syntax error in your own code. It would help if you'd add the relevant source code to your OP (Main.cpp?).

I found out that it is the ROS_INFO, ROS_ASSERT macro causing the error though the reason is ye unknown

Again, this is most likely a syntax error in your own code. We can only help you if you show us what you are doing exactly. The ROS_INFO and ROS_ASSERT macros have been used in hundreds, if not thousands of packages already. I'd be very surprised if they are the cause here.
