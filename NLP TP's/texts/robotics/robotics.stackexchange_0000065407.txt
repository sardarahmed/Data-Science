I'm new here. I want to save the rgb images and depth images from kinect and using wifi to send to another laptop.Is that accessible? If it's accessible, what packages do I need? Thank you very much.

A:

That should actually be quite easy with ROS. You will need a driver that allows the first computer to grab data from the Kinect and publish the data as ROS messages. Likely any of the following packages could work: openni_launch, openni2_launch, freenect_launch.
Then if your second computer is on the same network as the first, and your ROS network is configured correctly, then the second computer should be able to subscribe to messages produced on the first computer (including RBG and Depth streams from the Kinect).
