A:

There is the rosserial stack for communicating with Arduino microcontrollers. This is the closest that I know of to what you're trying to do.
You can find a possible help porting rosserial here.

If you're going to be making a lot of changes or a lot of different systems, porting rosserial to the PIC will make things easier. If you're building a single system, writing your own protocol and a ROS node to decode it may be easier.
