Q:

Need Info on simulated turtlebot2(melodic and/or kinetic)

I am looking for where to get a simulated turtlebot2. I recall finding a github link but I cant remember. If anyone uses simulated turtlebot2s please tell me how you got it or if you can make a github link where I can get it please, its urgent. For ROS melodic and/or Kinetic.

A:

This site could be your first step. There is this book where you could find more overall info too.

Does this setup not work for you in your case?
Comment by distro on 2022-01-08:
@ljaniec some of the steps used in the textbook dont work.
Comment by ljaniec on 2022-01-08:
Which one? Please describe these steps and we will try to resolve them :^)

@Ijaniec  forget what I asked about ros melodic, I have started using a real turtlebot2, I have been following the instructions from the book you suggested, all was going well until I ran this command on my remote PC
roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch
I get this error:
QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display 
[rviz-1] process has died [pid 8017, exit code -6, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/rviz/rviz -d /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_rviz_launchers/rviz/navigation.rviz __name:=rviz __log:=/home/turtlebot/.ros/log/39de43b2-7fed-11ec-a022-a0510b03a27d/rviz-1.log].
log file: /home/turtlebot/.ros/log/39de43b2-7fed-11ec-a022-a0510b03a27d/rviz-1*.log

I dont know why, I can eleop my robot from my remote pc, and this same command that gives me an error on remote PC works just fine when I run it on the laptop connected to the turtlebot2 itself. DO you know whats going on?

I have found some similar issues, I am not sure if they can help you though: link1, link2, link3. It seems like the QXcvConnection couldn't connect to your monitor through your connection, did you use -X option with ssh?

@ljaniec I think my problem was that I didnt have the turtlebot package in my remote PC. I'll install it and see what happens. Also, what planner does turtlebot2 use? DO I just install the ROS navigation stack to use that? I ask because I which to use DWA_local_planner for my tirtlebot2 and I need to change it's parameters to fit my use. When I'm using a turtlebot3 I can roscd turtlebot3_navigation and find the .yaml files that hold the parameters I wish to change. Is there a roscd turtlebot2_navigation type thing?
Comment by ljaniec on 2022-01-29:
There is a tutorial for a navigation stack setup on the TurtleBot and an example exercises. The general navigation package has a few tutorials too. I hope it could help you.

@ljaniec the turtlebot navigation package seems to not be created for ros kinetic? I see ros indigo, no kinetic, I'm using kinetic, what do I do?
Comment by ljaniec on 2022-01-29:
It's weird, ROS Wiki shows me kinetic version, same with ROS Index there. You can try to use the older version anyway to see if you have any problems during building/using it (which maybe you can fix to update the package for your case)
Comment by distro on 2022-01-29:
@ljaniec when you actually click on the repo link that the wiki page offers, you'll see that only indigo is available, there are others, but no ros kinetic branch

@ljaniec Thank you. I was able to get what I needed to work. Now I have a follow up question about turtlebot2  here if you have the time.
