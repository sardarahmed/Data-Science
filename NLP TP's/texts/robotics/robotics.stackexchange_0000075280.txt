I am using ros indigo and kinect xbox.
When i run the "rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker", i was getting  error InitFromXml failed: Can't create any node of the requested type!
I followed the suggestion provided from this link1 and link2
Here is the sequence of commands that i followed.
I have installed sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-freenect-stack
and NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch &
roslaunch pr2_LookAround_pkg face_detector.rgbd.launch &
rosrun rviz rviz

I tried by adding license sudo niLicense -l 0KOIk2JeIBYClPWVnMoRKn5cdY4=  , but no luck.

A:

you can try this:sudo apt-get install libopenni-dev libopenni-sensor-primesense-dev.
if it do not work :
$dpkg -l|grep openni   
  $rosdep install –from-path -s –reinstall
