Q:

Updating stacks

How do you update individual stacks inside the installation directory(/opt/ros/cturtle/stacks)? Say I want to update the geometry stacks because of eigen compatibility with eigen3. I thought updating apt will suffice but it didn't.

A:

Running sudo apt-get upgrade will apply all bug fix updates.
However, eigen3 is incompatible with the previous version, so it would not be appropriate to introduce that change in cturtle, which is already released and stable.
If you want the latest eigen interface, you should probably run diamondback, currently the newest ROS distribution.
