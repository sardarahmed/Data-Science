Q:

Attaching PR2 Gripper to UR10 robot

Hello
I am just starting with gazebo, and I have a problem with attaching the PR2 Gripper to the UR10 robot. I created the model.config and ur10PR2.sdf according to this tutorial. The problem is that it's not loading it. I get "unable to load file" and "parse as old deprecated model file failed" in the terminal. Any idea what I am doing wrong? Here are the two files.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<model>
  <name>Universal Robotics UR10 robot arm with PR2 gripper</name>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <sdf version='1.4'>ur10PR2.sdf</sdf>

And the sdf file:
<xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.3">
    <model name="ur10_pr2">

        <include>
            <uri>model://ur10</uri>
            <pose>0 0 0 0 0 0</pose>
        </include>

        <include>
            <uri>model://pr2_gripper</uri>
            <pose>1.1843 0.163941 0.0116 3.141591 0 3.141591</pose>
        </include>

        <joint name="arm_gripper_joint" type="revolute">
            <parent>ur10::wrist3</parent>
            <child>pr2_gripper::r_wrist_roll_link</child>
            <axis>
                <limit>
                    <lower>0</lower>

                </limit>
                <xyz>0 0 1</xyz>
            </axis>
        </joint>
    </model>

A:

The error is because you forgot the question mark on the xml tag on the sdf file:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
