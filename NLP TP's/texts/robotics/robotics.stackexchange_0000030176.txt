Q:

Depth value problem

Hi,
I use rosbag to record the information from a kinect camera, then I export the depth image from the bag file, but the image pixel value seems wrong with just a few values like 0,1,2. I don't know why. Does anybody can help me?
Regards
Wei

A:

Hi,
the output depth image is a floatingpoint image containing the depth values in meters. So, what format did you use to save them and read them back? Did you maybe use gray scale images instead?
