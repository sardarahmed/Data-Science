Q:

How do I install and run a ROS Package?

Let's use this one for example
h.ttp://www.ros.org/browse/details.php?distro=&name=camera_application
In terminal, what are the steps to install and run this package?
I know its a noob question but I didn't see anything in the tutorials about how to install a package from ROS.org

Are you interested in that one specifically or ROS packages in general. The example you picked is somewhat more complex. It seems to be for web apps (not "only" ROS) and it looks to me to not be maintained anymore.

ROS Packages in general

A:

Let me pick a simple one without specialties: rxparamedit.
Given you installed from packages in Ubuntu, the first step would be to check if there already is a debian package that you can just install. Usually that is named ros-<distro>-<stack/metapackage>. The nav-bar in the wiki shows the stack a package is in, which in this case would be freiburg_tools. For fuerte you'll find that sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-freiburg-tools works.
If there is no deb package, you have to install by sources. rosws/ws_tool is recommended for that. The wiki page should list a source URL, e.g. https://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/freiburg_tools. The rosws tutorials show how to do this in more detail, but basically rosws set --svn https://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/freiburg_tools and rosws update should do the trick.
Next, build the package by rosdep install rxparamedit and rosmake rxparamedit or catkin_make if the package is catkinized .
