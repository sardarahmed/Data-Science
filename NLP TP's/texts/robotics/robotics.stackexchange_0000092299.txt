Q:

How to download the file tiago_public.rosinstall

Hello, I am fairly new to programming with ROS and Linux in general and I need help. I am currently doing the "Installing TIAGo Simulation" tutorial an got stuck on step number on. I don't know what to do in this step:
" Download the file tiago_public.rosinstall. Copy the rosinstall file in ~/tiago_public_ws. "
(could some someone go step-by-step and explain what I should type in the terminal, line by line, please!!)

A:

The text you quote actually contains a link to the file that the author wants you to download:

Download the file tiago_public.rosinstall. Copy the rosinstall file in ~/tiago_public_ws. Then run the following instruction in order to clone all the required repositories within the workspace:

The tiago_public.rosinstall there is a link to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pal-robotics/tiago_tutorials/kinetic-devel/tiago_public-melodic.rosinstall.
To download that file would be no different from how you'd download it on Windows or OSX: right click the link and select Save link as (or whatever the equivalent is for your browser). Then select your workspace as instructed in the tutorial.
Alternatively, you could use a command like the following to download it using wget:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pal-robotics/tiago_tutorials/kinetic-devel/tiago_public-melodic.rosinstall -O $HOME/tiago_public_ws/

that would immediately place the downloaded file in the tiago_public_ws directory in your $HOME directory.

Thank you! This appears to have worked. After I typed this into my terminal ( rosinstall src /opt/ros/kinetic tiago_public.rosinstall ) in order to clone all the required repositories, and it also apeered to have downloaded a bunch of packages.
But midway I did some warnings and errors. I don't know whether to be concerned or simply ignore them...
error: RPC failed; curl 56 GnuTLS recv error (-54): Error in the pull function.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed
OR
ERROR in config: Error processing...
Example:   fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/pal-robotics/pmb2_simulation.git/': SSL: certificate subject name (cntlr.airrowdy.utsa.edu) does not match target host name 'github.com'
Is this some kind of network error?

Are you behind a network proxy of some kind? If so, that could explain this.
