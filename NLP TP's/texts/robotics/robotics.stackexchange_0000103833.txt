Q:

Custom Protobuf messages for Gazebo Sim, in separate package

I would like to define custom Protobuf messages for Gazebo Sim in a separate 'interfaces' repository (i.e. not in the gz-msgs source tree), and use them in another 'application' repository.
Can someone point me to example CMakeList.txt files for this?
The custom messages need to import existing messages (e.g. from gz-msgs or another messages repository).
(This question was edited and stripped from the info that is no longer relevant given the answer below.)

A:

I was pointed to the SubT Competition repository, which comes close but uses catkin.
But based on that I managed to get to a working solution.
I made a fully documented example repository, which can be found on GitHub here.
