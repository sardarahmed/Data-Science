Q:

recording only header image_raw message

I would like to record using rosbag only the /usb_cam/image_raw/header topic excluding the data.
Tried:
rosbag record -a -x  "/usb_cam1/image_raw/data"
But looks like it is not working. I have more topics to include than exclude so just checking for suggestions

header is not a topic, but a field.
Subscribing to fields is not supported, so I'm afraid what you want to do is impossible.
