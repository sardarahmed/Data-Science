A:

Which PCL version you are trying for ? Last friday June 21, fuerte was updated and issues related to pre PCL 1.6 versions were resolved. Hence, this should work fine.
You can install the ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-fuerte-unstable (sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-fuerte-unstable) package which adds pcl16 and pcl16_ros packages that track PCL 1.6.
The namespaces, filenames, and everything else have been changed from pcl to pcl16, so you need to make some minor changes to your code.
Like pcl::PointCloudpcl::PointXYZRGB becomes pcl16::PointCloudpcl16::PointXYZRGB. Doing it this way lets the two PCL versions coexist nicely.

I need to rebuild it from sources.

@devasena: Do you plan to enable access to the sources via "apt-get source" ?

No, but which PCL version you are trying to install ? " http://www.ros.org/wiki/perception_pcl " link that you are referring to is working fine and is valid.

I'm trying to install the source for fuerte. The command fails:\n$ svn co http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/branches/fuerte/perception_pcl\n
svn: Could not open the requested SVN filesystem

The updated debs of ros-fuerte-pcl are available here : " http://50.28.27.175/repos/building/pool/main/r/ros-fuerte-pcl/ " You can download based on the ubuntu distro (lucid, precise or oneiric) you are using.

I would have preferred the release for the armhf architecture. Thanks for your effort anyway.
