Q:

Using the Move_base package with only a local planner

Hi All,
I'm currently designing a mobile robot that is required to follow an object within 2 meters. Currently, the mobile robot is able to identify the object, its distance from the object, and its orientation with respect to the object - this is enough information for me to set a navigation goal relative to the mobile robots location. The robot will be following the object into unknown environments, we can assume these environments will not be mapped.
For this application I believe it should be satisfactory to use a local planner to reach the short distance goal while avoiding any obstacles along the way.
I would like to take advantage of the dwa_local_planner package within the move_base package but I am unsure if move_base can be used without a global planner and without a map.
I would appreciate any advice,
Thanks for your help!

A:

Although you can use move_base to follow a moving target, that is not the best approach because, as the goal changes, the move_base will abort the current motion, replan and execute.
check this related question, there are several interesting answers to this problem: http://answers.ros.org/question/28950/what-is-the-best-way-to-follow-a-moving-target/

Thanks for linking your previous question, there is some good information on that thread. I was never intending on using a global planner as you suggested in your question, only the local planner - which apparently is used in the "controlling" state.
