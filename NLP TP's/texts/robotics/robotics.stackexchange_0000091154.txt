Q:

[SOLVED] fedora: rqt_plot runtime error

I'm running ROS Kinetic on Fedora 29.
After running successfully these commands:
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
rqt_graph

I try to run rqt_plot /turtle1/pose/x /turtle1/pose/y or equivalently rqt_plot /turtle1/pose/x:y and it gives the following error:
Warning: QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO is deprecated. Instead use:
   QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR to enable platform plugin controlled per-screen factors.
   QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS to set per-screen factors.
   QT_SCALE_FACTOR to set the application global scale factor.
PluginManager._load_plugin() could not load plugin "rqt_plot/Plot":

RuntimeError: No usable plot type found. Install at least one of: PyQtGraph, MatPlotLib (at least 1.4.0) or Python-Qwt5.

So I've checked these three libraries and it seems they're all installed:
-for PyQtGraph I have python3-pyqtgraph
-for MatPlotLib I have python2-matplotlib
-for Python-Qwt5 I have  PyQwt-5.2.0-40.fc29.src.rpm
So I don't get why this is not working properly since I have all of them.
Anyway, I think that instead of python3-pyqtgraph I should install python2-pyqtgraph but dnf doesn't find it because it's an old version I think (or maybe it is deprecated).

A:

Solved by running sudo pip install PyQtGraph

This is the right way to work around this. For context, python2-pyqtgraph was dropped prior to the Fedora 30 release: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-pyqtgraph/c/99946ff0e44ba9241e6c2a3ffc56bf1f77b0554e?branch=master
