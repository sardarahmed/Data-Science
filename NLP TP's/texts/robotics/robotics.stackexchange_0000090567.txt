Q:

Messages aren't built

I've downloaded a ROS package and I would like to use its messages in my program, however, for some weird reason the messages aren't built and thus I get an error.
My package.xml has this:
<exec_depend>nerian_stereo</exec_depend>

my CMakeLists.txt has this:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  rospy
  message_runtime
  std_msgs
  nerian_stereo
)

and my code file has this:
from nerian_stereo import * 
self.camera_info = rospy.Subscriber("/nerian_stereo/stereo_camera_info", StereoCameraInfo ,self.stereo_camera_cb)

however I still get this annoying error of:
NameError: global name 'StereoCameraInfo' is not defined

What's wrong? I also observed my catkin_make and I see that this package is not built at all, the output does not show its name. Is there yet another file which needs to be edited?
EDIT: Here is the message: http://docs.ros.org/api/nerian_stereo/html/msg/StereoCameraInfo.html

Can you locate your package with rospack find ?
Comment by Jägermeister on 2019-02-18:
Yes, it returns /opt/ros/melodic/share/nerian_stereo.

Did you source your workspace first?
When you are at ~/catkin_ws, try to source devel/setup.bash and then catkin_make

A:

Afaik importing msgs in Python would follow the pattern:
from pkg_name.msg import SomeMsg

In your case you'd probably have to adapt your import line to use that pattern, or spec msg.StereoCameraInfo in your rospy.Subscriber(..) line.

Now it did work, yes. It was from nerian_stereo.msg import StereoCameraInfo . If you add it as answer I can accept.
