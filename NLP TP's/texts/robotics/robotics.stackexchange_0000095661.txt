Q:

Cmake error when installing beginner_tutorials/package

I am following the below tutorials for ROS and am creating a ROS package but am running into issues.
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and kinetic kame.
I have entered the following commands in order:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make

I am receiving no errors when creating the catkin package, but when I use the catkin_make command I get a CMake error as below:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pocketsphinx" with
  any of the following names:

    pocketsphinxConfig.cmake
    pocketsphinx-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pocketsphinx" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pocketsphinx_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pocketsphinx" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

Makefile:2628: recipe for target 'cmake_check_build_system' failed
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

Has anyone come accross this issue before?
I have installed the pocketsphinx using the follwing commands:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install pocketsphinx

This installs with no issues but when I use 'catkin make' I get the same error as above.
Update
I have also tried to install python pcketsphinx using the below commands. But when I try catkin_make again I still get the same errors as above.
$ sudo apt update -y
$ sudo apt-get install -y python-pocketsphinx

It's more likely CMake is looking for the (old) pocketsphinx ROS package.
However, if you've just installed ROS, this doesn't make much sense.
Can you please include the output of ls -al ~/catkin_ws/src?

it seems you have quite a few other packages in your workspace.
Your problems are not with the beginner_tutorials, but with one of those other packages.
I would suggest to:

either solve the problem with those other packages
create a new workspace and follow the tutorials with that new workspace, or
move the packages which are in your current workspace to some temporary location so you only keep the beginner_tutorials package

This worked.
I made a temporary folder for the following:
Gaitech edu_master
raspicam_node
ros_tutorials_topis
turtlebot3
turtlebot3_msgs
turtlebot3_applications
turtlebot3_applications_msgs
I then ran catkin_make again with no error.
I was not aware of problems with the other packages but I will begin to look into that.
Thanks for your help.
