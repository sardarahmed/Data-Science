Q:

Where does message "Message Filter dropping message" comes from

I'm trying to debug find the root cause that generate this kind of error messages:
[planner_server-17] [INFO] [1667918874.743278206] [global_costmap.global_costmap]: Message Filter dropping message: frame 'laser_merged' at time 1667918874.441 for reason 'the timestamp on the message is earlier than all the data in the transform cache'

But I could not find in the code for Humble of the whole nav2 repo nor the message_filters any code printing this message, by CTRL+F its keywords like "earlier", "for reason", "Message Filter dropping message"...
Where does this message comes from ?

A:

It's from tf2_ros::MessageFilter, not message_filters itself (that's a different package, different class).
Specifically, here.
