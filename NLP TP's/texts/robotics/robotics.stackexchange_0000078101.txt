Q:

CMake warning on ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS}

I'm unable to get rid of include directory warnings during a catkin_make.
One of my packages is dependent on boost. I made sure to use find_package so that the include dirs variables get populated, but still get warnings during a build...although boost is discovered during the build. See warning at the end of the post.
Thanks.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(test)

# search for everything we need to build the package
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  sensor_msgs
  std_msgs
)

# since we need boost search it as well
# find_package makes the ${..._INCLUDE_DIRS} ${..._LIBRARIES} variables we use later
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system thread)

# export the dependencis of this package for who ever depends on us
catkin_package(
  INCLUDE_DIRS include
  CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp sensor_msgs std_msgs 
  DEPENDS boost
)

# tell catkin where to find the headers for this project
include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# make the executables
add_executable( test_node src/test.cpp )

add_dependencies( test_node   ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} )

target_link_libraries( test_node  ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${Boost_LIBRARIES} )
