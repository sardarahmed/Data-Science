Q:

Any one knows how to apply the camera calibration matrix to OpenNI

Hi, Everyone:
I've already use ROS to get a calibration file (in YAML). Now, I want to use these camera parameters to my own project (3D reconstruction.) So, how can I capture data from Kinect while using these updated camera parameters through OpenNI(intrinsic, extrinsic, distortion, rectification)?  Because all my codes are written in OpenCV and OpenNI. Thank you very much.

A:

If you are using "openni_launch"

roslaunch openni_launch openni_launch

with rgb_camera_info_url and depth_camera_info_url arguments. See openni_launch documentation: http:// wiki.ros.org/openni_launch#Arguments
