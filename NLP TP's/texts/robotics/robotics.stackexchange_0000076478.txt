Q:

Kinematic and dynamic equations of Robot

Hello Everyone,
I was using innok_heros model for my learning of ROS. I wish if I could have a resource explaining the kinematic equation of the differential drive and other dynamic performance related equations for this robot or any other differential drive robot simulated using ROS.
Thank you.

Hi, just search for differential drive info.
Example: (the video is OK, but, it is kind of slow)
https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs149/documentation/differentialDrive.pdf

If you are done with the theory, then, look at this package and to some of the projects that are using it: http://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller
There is a package that seems to be what you are asking for: http://wiki.ros.org/differential_drive
For learning the core of wheeled mobile robots I recommend you to read chapter 3 of this book:
http://www.robotee.com/EBooks/Introduction_to_Autonomous_Mobile_Robots.pdf
BE AWARE: That Innok Robotics has actually two types of mobile robots (http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Innok-Heros), one is differential (Innok Heros 223) and the other one is an over-constrained mobile robot (Innok Heros 444) that is used mostly for outdoor purposes and "behaves" like a tank in terms of its way of turning (look at: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~johannb/Papers/paper95.pdf).

Thank you very much for the reply. Since I am new to the ROS environment, I would like to know in what files are the equations for kinetics (suppose for differential drive) are written.
