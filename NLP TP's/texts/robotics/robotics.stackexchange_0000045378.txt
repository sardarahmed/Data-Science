Please open individual threads for multiple questions keeping this one for the gmapping question.

A:

The simple answer is no. gmapping needs odometry.
You can either use SLAM that doesn't require this as hector_mapping or find an intermediate node that can produce odometry from IMU or laser + imu. http://www.ros.org/wiki/laser_scan_matcher should provide this functionality.
