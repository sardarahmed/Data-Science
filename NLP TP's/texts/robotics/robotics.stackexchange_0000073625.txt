Q:

Can the ROS visp_tracker be used in hybrid mode

The current visp_tracker seems to only use edges. Can it be switched to use both edges and key-points?
It seems the underlying tracker is geared for mbt+klt, but I don't know how to change it from just mbt to hybrid (mbt+klt) tracking type.

A:

The tracker_type param could be set to:

mbt: meaning tracking with edges only
klt: tracking with keypoints only
mbt+klt: hybrid tracking using edges + keypoints

`
<node pkg="visp_tracker" type="tracker" name="tracker_mbt">
    <param name="camera_prefix" value="/wide_left/camera" />
    <param name="tracker_type" value="mbt+klt" />
</node>

Thanks Fabien. I managed to get this to work shortly after I posted the question, but neglected to comment. I found that tracking with both edges and key points, the tracker seemed to get lost more easily in a cluttered environment.
