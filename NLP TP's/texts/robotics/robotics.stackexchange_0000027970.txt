Q:

Mesh not displayed when launching with ROS

Hi,
I created a cube with a texture in Blender, exported it as .obj and converted it with meshlab to .dae. I included the File in the world and works fine if I run it with gazebo . But if I try running it with ROS, where i basically just included that world, the Object is not visible. ROS outputs also an errormessage, but I don't know if it's related to Problem.
Versions:
Ubuntu 14.04, ROS Indigo, Gazebo 2.2.3
Only Gazebo:

With Ros:

Errormessage:
If you need any further information, just let me know what you need.
Any Help is appreciated.
Thanks
