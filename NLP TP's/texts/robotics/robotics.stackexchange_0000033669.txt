A:

You have a problem in your package sources/package install. Can you update your original post with your /etc/apt/sources.list? There should only be lucid entries in there.
Some package is "blocking" your install. To figure out the cause, you can choose one in the list, where it says "but is not going to be installed", and install only that. If you get a similar error there, continue with the package causing the next error until you get a different error.
Usually you arrive at some error that tells you it wants a package in a certain version, but it can only be installed in another one (or not at all). Post that error here.
In general you should make sure that your /etc/apt/sources.list only contains lucid entries, run apt-get update and then resolve the situation.
