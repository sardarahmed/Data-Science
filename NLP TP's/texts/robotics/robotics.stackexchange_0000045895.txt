Q:

How to remove/uninstall fuerte completely?

I'm planning to install ros groovy and I want to remove everything related to ros fuerte what so ever. I don't want to have any kind of problems due to conflicts between the new groovy and the old version of ros that I'm currently using and for that, I want a complete removal. Will the following do the job?
sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-*

Or I should delete some certain files/directories manually?

A:

You will not have any problems when you install Fuerte and Groovy in parallel. If you really want to get rid of Fuerte, your apt-get command should do the job.
But note that Groovy is not released yet. As far as I know, it even didn't reach beta yet. I would expect a lot of problems and wait with the update.
