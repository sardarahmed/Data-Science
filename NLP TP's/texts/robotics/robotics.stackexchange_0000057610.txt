Q:

Octomap + Rosjava?

First of all, sorry if the question is a foolishness. I am going to substitute Player (which I use with PlayerClient) by ROS (which I ment to use with Rosjava).
In the current implementation I use a custom-defined map type, but I need to change it by Octomap. I know that there is a Octomap plugin to use with ROS, but I need to know if it is possible to recover the map using Rosjava and obtain information about it.
Thank you in advance.

A:

You can receive the octomap message with rosjava and interpret the information yourself. However the octomap library itself that makes this usable is written in C++.
AFAIK there are no java bindings.

Thank you. I have implemented a basic java binding for the main functionalities of Octomap, so I hope integrate to integrate Octomap in my planner.

If you are happy with the bindings, these would be nice to package in the core rosjava repos - perhaps rosjava_extras.
