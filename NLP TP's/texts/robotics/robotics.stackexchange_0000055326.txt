Q:

Ubuntu 13.10 and catkin

When I try anything at all with catkin, the system is unable to find it, unable to download it, unable to install it, anything at all. I need it in order to do a custom build gazebo-ros-pkgs, and I am unable to do anything with catkin because it cannot be found.
   dev@dev-700Z7C:~$ catkin_
    catkin_create_pkg          catkin_tag_changelog
    catkin_find_pkg            catkin_test_changelog
    catkin_generate_changelog  
    dev@dev-700Z7C:~$ cd Code/
    dev@dev-700Z7C:~/Code$ cd catkin/
    dev@dev-700Z7C:~/Code/catkin$ cd src
    dev@dev-700Z7C:~/Code/catkin/src$ catkin_init_workspace
    catkin_init_workspace: command not found
    dev@dev-700Z7C:~/Code/catkin/src$ ^C
    dev@dev-700Z7C:~/Code/catkin/src$

A:

You are trying to run the catkin commands in a shell without the ROS directories added to the PATH. Specifically, you need to run either manually or in your .bashrc: source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
Take a closer look at the setup tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
