Q:

Peak_pci usage with socketcan_interface

Hi there,
I was planning to use PCAN_M.2 with ROS, but I did see a note in  socketcan_interface  saying that peak_pci has IRQ problems in section 3. Is it up to date? Is there anyone using any PCAN (mini-PCIe, M.2, etc) devices with ROS? I want to make sure that it works before purchasing it.
Thanks in advance.

A:

For the past year or so I have been using the exact module in combination with an Intel NUC7i7DNBE (https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/130394/intel-nuc-board-nuc7i7dnbe.html) using Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS1 melodic and I have not noticed any IRQ problems.
I have not used the socketcan_interface package, but instead used a CANOpen stack implementation in a custom node, but since all communication is abstracted from user space by the socketcan driver, I wonder how it would not work with the socketcan_interface package.

Hi! How do you "wake up" the peak hardware?
I am using the USB-CAN converter, which i have to "wake up" like this: http://codingadventures.org/2018/10/03/peak-can-usb-with-socketcan/
My pc also has a PCI express Peak module mounted, but cannot find it nor activate it .... :S
