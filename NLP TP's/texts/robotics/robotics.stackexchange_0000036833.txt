Q:

I found most of the ROS packages are in home/user/ros but the latest in /opt/ros/

Hi all,
After I finish the beginner level tutorial actually I am a bit lost.. I don't have the 2dnav_pr2 package. I start wandering around the forum. Based on http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_2dnav_gazebo/Tutorials/Simulating%20the%202dnav%20Stack I installed cturtle, diamondback and electric packages.
Then my roscd will lead me to /opt/ros/ instead of /home/user/ros. I found that the last three packages are installed to /opt/ros/. Could anyone explain me the setup.sh?
Now if I run . setup.sh in the /home/user/ros, the roscd cannot be found. quite confusing about the situation. Hope some one help me out and give me instructions on how to perform a simulation...

These days, setup.sh is recommended only for non-bash shells. If you source setup.bash instead, it will define functions like roscd.

Hi,

Hope this helps,

I suggest you to have ros_workspace as given in the 1st tutorial and setup the environment. So that even your later downloaded packages do not have this problem. Now you can copy them to a workspace folder n setup the envi

Hi thanks karthik. I think the first beginning when I come to the enviroment configuration I encountered some problem and I changed the PACKAGE_PATH to /home/user/ros/ros.  For these three packages, do i need to reinstall them? I think i spent hours get them installed...or can I just change some parameters to let them work?
