Q:

ROS2 launch external (non ROS) program

Hello,
I am looking for a possibility to start a non-ROS program in ROS2 with a launchfile. For ROS1 there is aliencontrol.
Is there something like this for ROS2?
Or is it possible to start external programs from the Python launchfile?
Thank you!
Jan

A:

Take a look at the ExecuteProcess Action (https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/master/launch/launch/actions/execute_process.py#L89)
In fact, the Node Action you're probably already using in the python launch script wraps ExecuteProcess.
ExecuteProcess(cmd=['ping', '192.168.1.1'],
               output='screen'),

Concrete example that uses ExecuteProcessAction can be found in the official tutorial https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Intermediate/Launch/Using-Event-Handlers.html
