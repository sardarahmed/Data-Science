Q:

CMake optimizing out values in debug mode

I'm trying to view some simple int variables in GDB, but they're all being marked as "value optimized out". At the top of my CMakeLists.txt file, I have
set(ROS_BUILD_TYPE Debug)

Do I need to set something else?

A:

You need to recompile what the section of code that you are running.  And if you're inside a library you need to recompile that library. (What you have noted is correct for rosbuild based packages.)

This is actually after a make clean and rosmake.
