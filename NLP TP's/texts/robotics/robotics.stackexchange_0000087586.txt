Q:

Can ROS messages be exchanged between a nonROS machine?

Currently i am working with ROS2 which is based on DDS. So I have ROS2 installed on 1 machine and on the other I have a DDS implementation. So basically I can exchange messages through DDS and I do not explicitly need to have ROS2 also installed on the 2nd machine.
Could tihs be also possible with ROS 1 ? Since ROS is based on a Master/ Slave system, could it be possible somehow to exchange info between a nonROS machine by exchanging IP address or something ?

A:

Yes, it is possible. One of the most widely used methods for accomplishing this is using rosbridge.  There are lots of clients for rosbridge in many different programming languages. So, you can run rosbridge_server in your ROS1 computer and then use a rosbridge_client of your preference in your non-ROS computer.

Thank you. I will study more about it and come back to you :)

Just out of curiosity, can the non ROS machine also be a Windows machine and does both the machines need to be in the same network to communicate like in ROS2 ? @lucascoelho

Not sure if I understood you, but ROS1 does not runs in Windows natively. You can use a rosbridge client, as I said, in the Windows side to communicate with your ROS machine. And yes, using rosbridge they don't need to be in the same network (assuming no firewalls). Let me know if it was clear.

I guess I understood it. The only unclear point is that do i then need to implement socket programming in my ROS node as well ? e.g. I have a ROS node communicating with ROS server and the node is exchanging messages with a Windows based client. Could you direct me to some examples or literature ?

If you read the installation section here, it states that a working ROS installation is required within the network. So now I am a bit confused. @lucascoelho could you explain the difference between what you said and this statement ?

Since you want to use a python client and you have opted for roslibpy, you need both rosbridge and tf2_web_republished. In this link you can find installation and run instructions http://roslibpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/

Here is an example on how to read a topic using roslibpy https://github.com/gramaziokohler/roslibpy/blob/master/tests/test_topic.py

@lucascoelho : As soon as I run the tf2_web_republisher, it gives me a segmentation fault(core dumped) error. I am using ROS Kinetic. Did you ever face this problem ?
