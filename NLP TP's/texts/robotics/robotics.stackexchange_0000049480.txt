A:

PCL just moved to github a few days ago: https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl
See this post by Jochen Sprickerhof for more information (also on how to access the new git repository by svn). I don't know if this works with the perception_unstable branch for ROS integration though. Can you comment if you tried?
EDIT:
Antonio took this matter to the PCL-users list. The correct path for checking out the perception_unstable branch (= PCL trunk for ROS) from github seems to be https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/fuerte-unstable-devel.

It is not working! Building CXX object io/CMakeFiles/pcl_io.dir/src/image_grabber.cpp.o
