Q:

turtlebot with one or two laptops

Hi,
I am new to ROS and Linux. Interested in getting a turtlebot.
From turtlebot's website, it seems it already has a laptop directly connected to the turtlebot via a USB calbe.
here is my questions. How is the turtlebot typically used?
a) Do I need to have another laptop/desktop that is connected to the laptop on turtlebot via network, so that instructions can be transmitted from the laptop/desktop to the laptop on the turtlebot via the network?
b) or can  I just use the laptop on top of the turtlebot, if I feel it is not inconvenient to unplug the laptop from turtlebot, write my program on the laptop, and then plug the laptop to the turtlebot?
Thank you.
Jack

A:

We have used many, many TurtleBots. :)
When we are doing more basic development work with the TurtleBot (parameter tweaking, minor changes, running long-duration tests), the onboard netbook is sufficient. Whenever we need to do more detailed development work, a second computer is recommended. Two main reasons for this:

Display/graphics: Properly displaying all of the data that the robot can provide alongside your source code is done best with a good monitor (or monitors).
Comfort. Long periods of programming at knee height is uncomfortable. You can avoid this by unplugging the robot/uncoiling the cables, but it's nice to be able to rapidly iterate on coding and live tests without having to worry about putting the cables/netbook back together.

As I said, once we're generally happy with the results and are just tweaking things, we'll usually do so on the netbook.
