Q:

Updating voice_nav.py in pocketsphinx to fix Turtlebot2 issue

I noticed an issue with the voice control example, voice_nav.py, in pocketsphinx. I'm new to ROS and don't know who to tell to suggest a fix. Could someone tell me how to go about notifying someone about this issue?
Here is the issue as I understand it. In pocketsphinx, voice_nav.py publishes on the /cmd_vel topic to move the robot. I think this works fine for the original turtlebot, but the turtlebot2 with a Kobuki base needs this published on /cmd_vel_mux/input/navi topic.
To get the pocketsphinx samples running on my turltebot2, I had to change line 44 of voice_nav.py from

self.cmd_vel_pub = rospy.Publisher('cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=5)

to

self.cmd_vel_pub = rospy.Publisher('cmd_vel_mux/input/navi', Twist, queue_size=5)

But I think this fixes it for the turtlebot2, but breaks it for the original turtlebot.
So, how do I go about notifying someone of this issue?

A:

Rather than modifying the code directly, you can change topic names with remapping:
rosrun my_package my_node cmd_vel:=cmd_vel_mux/input/navi

Who to notify depends on where the sample is hosted. If it's a book, you should contact the author (maybe by opening a ticket on their bug tracker, if they have one). If it's a wiki page, you may just be able to update the wiki page with a different command for the turtlebot2 .
