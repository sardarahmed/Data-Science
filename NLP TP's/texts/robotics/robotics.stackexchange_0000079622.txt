Q:

ROSJava installation problem

Hi, I want to install rosjava in my labtop. And I follow the instructions

http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/indigo/Source%20Installation

And in step 3.3, When I input:

wstool merge https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me/rosinstalls/master/my_custom_msg_repos.rosinstall

I got the error:

ERROR in config: Unable to download URL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/me/rosinstalls/master/my_custom_msg_repos.rosinstall]: HTTP Error 404: Not Found

It seems the address is not existed any more. Anyone has the idea what problem is this? How can I solve this problem?

A:

It seems this source installation doesn't work, so I try the deb installation. Let's see what happened...
