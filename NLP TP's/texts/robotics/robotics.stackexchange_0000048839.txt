Q:

Rviz get selected markers

I've written an Rviz plugin that allows users to click on interactive markers to label them. There are typically many markers in a scene that share a label, so I'd like to be able to label groups of markers at once. I can select groups of markers using the selection tool, but I can't figure out how to get a list of selected markers from my within my plugin. Does anyone know how to do that?

A:

Use VisualizationManager::getSelectionManager, SelectionManager::getSelection and SelectionManager::getHandler.

Thanks, I'll take a look at that.

Hello,
I'm not sure about labeling but we wrote a plugin that publishes all selected points on a ros topic. Perhaps a look at the code would be helpful:
