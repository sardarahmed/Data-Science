Q:

Data Droping at transport layer

Can we do data droping and filtering at transport layer(TCP).
I want to drop useless packets at Transport layer. To save the bandwidth,energy of nodes and reduce the congestion. So is it possible to drop packets at transport layer.

If you want to do filtering at the TCP level there are lots of standard tools for doing that such as iptables.
