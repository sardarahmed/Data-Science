Q:

Header usage among packages

I'm having a problem including an header file from another package.
In package package_a I have created an header file and I want to include it in package_b. I thought this should be possible using
#include <package_a/header.hpp>
I also have the dependency included in the manifest. I'm getting the error that there is no such file or directory.
It's probably a linking/library issue but I'm not familiar with linking.
I'm using this header file to share some definitions (constants) among packages, so if there is an (better) alternative solution feel free to share.

A:

You need to export the include and possibly linker flags of the header in its manifest.

Right. Here's an example. It goes in package_a's manifest file and assumes you have your includes in package_a's include directory:
