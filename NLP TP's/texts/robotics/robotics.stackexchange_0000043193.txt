Q:

error when compiling packages on crosscompile ros for nao robot

I am having error message when compiling packages rosmake common as in the tutorial (step 7): http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao/Tutorials/Cross-Compiling
I am using Natty 11.04 with diamondback and NAO SDk 1.10.52.

Please add the correct tags to your question, so it can be found (nao, rospack, ...). That looks like a linker error, could you post the complete output in your question?
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2012-08-14:
I have updated my question. Thanks

A:

can you try to follow the tutorial exactly as described in the tutorial, step-by-step and just copy&paste the shell scripts/commands into your terminal, leaving everything unchanged?

Its exactly the same as the tutorial as only one difference,  I compile the diamond ros for Desktop install, not the RosBone (The source: http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu/Source). tried previously to install the Rod Bones but the rosinstall didnt produce tf and bullet. thanks
Comment by daniel_maier on 2012-08-16:
you also used a different path which lets me assume that you did not just copy&paste the instructions. there will be a tutorial for fuerte comming soon, maybe you also want to wait for that?
Comment by ryann2k1 on 2013-01-20:
when will the fuerte tutorial be released? Btw, I have changed the the path according to the tutorial, but still the same error occured. /media/external/ros/diamondback/ros/tools/rospack/lib/librospack.so: undefined reference to `std::_List_node_base::_M_hook(std::_List_node_base*)@GLIBCXX_3.4.14'
