Q:

Formationing Algorithm for Multiple Robots

I'm looking for an algorithm for formationing multiple robots in 2D simulation. Can you suggest resources about this topic. Also I need suggestions and comments about these topics:

Can I recruit algorithm from optimization algorithms like particle or ant?
Is there any way except "go to goal" for each robot
Is patter formationing algorithms feasible?
Suggestions about a fast way of formationing/ aligning

Notes:

Im not using a robotics simulator or physics engine for this. 
Robots are represented as dots.
multi robot system is homogeneous
every robot can sense obstacles and other robots in a sense range circle around the robot.  
number of obstacles and robots can vary from 2 to 100 
multi robot system is not a central 

A:

You could have a look at the papers of the kilobot project. They have your capabilities so it would be a good starting point.
