Are you using ROS?

A:

Assuming that you're intending to do some sort of processing on the frames from the video stream...
If you use the imread method and the mjpeg_server it should still be possible to use something like img=imread('http://localhost:8080/snapshot?topic=/IMAGE_TOPIC') to access the current image.
I hope speed isn't a concern for your application, it's been a while since I tried something like this, and if memory serves me well, it took about 1-2 seconds per frame for the images that I was sending.
(As a note, I do not remember if there was any magic associated with telling matlab the file extension since it's not included in the url)
