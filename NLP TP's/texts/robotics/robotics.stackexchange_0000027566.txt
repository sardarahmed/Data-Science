Q:

Using ROS without gazebo_ros_pkgs?

Hi,
I made a project using Gazebo and plugins to simulate a Robot. ROS is now not even installed on my computer. I wonder if I can use the roscpp librairy to integrate ROS in my project, without using the gazebo_ros_pkgs. The reason why I want to do like this is that I would like to compare my own IK algorithm to common ones available with ROS, and therefore integrate ROS in my Gazebo model_plugin.
As you might guess, I don't really know the ROS environnement. Just tell me if my question doesn't make sens!
Best.

A:

You don't need to use gazebo_ ros_pkgs in order to use ROS with Gazebo. In fact, gazebo_ros_pkgs consists mostly of Gazebo plugins that have some component of ROS.
I'd recommend looking at the source code of gazebo_ros_pkgs for tips and ideas on integrating ROS with your own Gazebo plugins. Here is a good example
