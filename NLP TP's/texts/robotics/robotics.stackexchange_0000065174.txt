A:

From the error it looks like you might feed the system color images, but it only is able to process grayscale. Another possibility seems to be that the resolution (image size) stated in your camera_info and your image are not consistent. That would be my first guesses, given the message
Frame: provided image has not the same size as the camera model or image is not grayscale

you could just run the image_proc node to get the grayscale image or write your own subscriber and publisher to convert the rgb image to grayscale
