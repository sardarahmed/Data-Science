Q:

Keyboard based teleop pkg for generic stage simulated robots

Greetings,
Is any package available for tele-operating  robots in robot in stage/gazebo using keyboard. I am trying hands on move_base_gmapping_5cm.launch in navigation_stage package.
keyboard_teleop.launch from turtlebot_teleop package is not able to make robot move.
Is it possible for anyone to share package written for such task?

A:

I often use the pr_teleop package for simple teleop tasks as it publishes on the 'cmd_vel' topic by default and can easily be started using
rosrun pr2_teleop teleop_pr2_keyboard

You can find much more comprehensive answers here.
