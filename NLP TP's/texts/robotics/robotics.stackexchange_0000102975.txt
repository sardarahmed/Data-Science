Q:

Running humble on Turtlebot3

Hi, I recently got a turtlebot3 burger and I only see instructions for installing foxy on it. I saw that the turtlebot3 GitHub page has humble support. Can I flash a regular Ubuntu 22 on the tb3 RPi and then build the turtlebot3 repo from source?

Please don't ask questions as an answer.

Flashing Ubuntu 22, installing ROS2 Humble, and building tb3 humble from source works
