Q:

rosout keeps respawning even after killall

Hi All,
I am working on automating my experiment runs and hence need to kill all nodes periodically. I am using rosnode kill -a at the moment, but the rosout process keeps re-spawning all the time. I have indicated in my launch file that all the nodes have a respawn="false" argument. Does anybody know which this could be happening?
I issue the rosnode kill -a from a python script which I used to automate my runs as
os.system('rosnode kill --all')

Best,

A:

The rosout node is part of roscore. If you really need to shut it down, you will have to kill roscore too.
Hope this helps.

Already tried that, but the respawn is still persistent.

As I said, rosout is part of roscore. You can not have the latter without the former. Out of curiosity, how is rosout a concern to you?
