Q:

Differences GMapping ROS/ROS 2

Is gmapping in ROS 2 better than in ROS?
Right now i'm using a Turtlebot3 that has the best support for ROS kinetic. But i find the Gmapping that comes out of the box pretty lackluster (Being outperformed by hector).
Does ROS 2 actually have better Gmapping than ROS Kinetic?
Thanks in advance :)

A:

No.
In fact, there is no supported branch of slam gmapping, nor will there likely to be. The default recommended option for ROS2 is SLAM Toolbox.
The distribution of ROS doesn't change the underlying algorithm, its just the piping. I wouldn't expect now or any time in the future for any serious development on gmapping.
