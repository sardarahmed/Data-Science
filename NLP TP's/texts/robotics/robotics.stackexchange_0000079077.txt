Q:

About listener.cpp tutorial. disobey cpp grammar?

 #include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"

void chatterCallback(const std_msgs::String::ConstPtr& msg)
{
  ROS_INFO("I heard: [%s]", msg->data.c_str());
}

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
      ros::init(argc, argv, "listener");
    
      ros::NodeHandle n;
    
      ros::Subscriber sub = n.subscribe("chatter", 1000, chatterCallback);
    
      ros::spin(); 
    
      return 0;
    }

there is no actual parameter passing to chatterCallback function?

A:

chatterCallback is used a function pointer in this context, so the function isn't being called by advertise(). Instead, the address of the function is stored and used later to call that function every time a new message arrives.
Here's a wikipedia article about function pointers and another article specifically about using function pointers in C++ if you want to learn more about the details.

Thanks! I found I was stupid and forgot the function pointers...
