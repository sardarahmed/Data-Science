Q:

Non-existent package gazebo in ROS hydro

Hi All,
I am using rosmake a package in ROS hydro, but it gives me below errors:
 [rosbuild] Building package labrob_hummingbird_controller
  Failed to invoke /opt/ros/hydro/bin/rospack deps-manifests labrob_hummingbird_controller
  [rospack] Error: package/stack 'labrob_hummingbird_controller' depends on non-existent package 'gazebo' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'
  
  
  CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:129 (message):
    
  
    Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package
    'labrob_hummingbird_controller'.  Look above for errors from rospack
    itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the broken dependency!

It seems that there is no gazebo dependency any more in ROS hydro. Does anyone know which dependency I should use to replace gazebo? The manifest.xml of the stack 'labrob_hummingbird_controller'  can be found below:
<package>
  <description brief="HummingBirdController">

  <depend package="gazebo"/>
  <depend package="geometry_msgs"/>
  <depend package="gazebo_plugins"/>
  <depend package="ar_pose"/>
  <!--depend package="ipc_bridge"/-->

  <export>
    <gazebo plugin_path="${prefix}/lib" />
  </export>

</package>

A:

ROS hydro + Gazebo have a new integration package now
I hope this helps you http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/Overview_of_new_ROS_integration
