Q:

iai_kinect2 /dev/dri/card0 not authenticated

Dear ROS users, I have a problem with iai_kinect2 package (Indigo). I can successfully use Kinect V2 on my Intel NUC. I am not able to use it when the computer does not have the monitor plugged (through ssh). When I launch roslaunch kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge.launch
I got this error:

/dev/dri/card0 not authenticated

Is it possible to run kinect2_bridge without a screen monitor?

I believe iai_kinect2 uses OpenGL (perhaps even by default). I can imagine that some of the driver infrastructure needed for that is not active when you don't have your monitor plugged in.

A:

I am posting my workaround in case it helps someone else. I solved adding the user to video group and modifying the /etc/default/grub in this way: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash drm.rnodes=1".
After update grub it worked.
