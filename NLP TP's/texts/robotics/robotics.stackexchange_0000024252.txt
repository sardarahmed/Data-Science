Q:

ROS2 Humble packages for Ubuntu 22.04 - what is the perception package?

I've tried searches for documentation on the package but whilst I can sudo apt install -y ros-humble-perception or load it via docker as "ros-humble-perception" I didn't find any documentation to explain what it is apart from a mention on the humble release, ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill Released!
It appears to have added packages over base but not include simulation or full desktop.

A:

The proper reference is the ROS Enhancement Proposals (REPs) which provide a concise technical specification for various things related to ROS.
There you can find a document describing the different ROS 2 variants. It says

The perception variant includes packages commonly used for perception capabilities.

and as you can see it is only available from Humble Hawksbill.
Thus the ros-humble-perception variant contains following packages:
- perception:
    extends:  [ros_base]
    packages: [image_common, image_pipeline, image_transport_plugins,
               laser_filters, laser_geometry, perception_pcl,
               vision_opencv]

including ros_base that is defined as
- ros_base:
    extends:  [ros_core]
    packages: [geometry2, kdl_parser, robot_state_publisher,
               rosbag2, urdf]

and ros_core with
- ros_core:
    packages: [ament_cmake, ament_cmake_auto, ament_cmake_gmock,
               ament_cmake_gtest, ament_cmake_pytest,
               ament_cmake_ros, ament_index_cpp,
               ament_index_python, ament_lint_auto,
               ament_lint_common, class_loader, common_interfaces,
               launch, launch_ros, launch_testing,
               launch_testing_ament_cmake, launch_testing_ros,
               launch_xml, launch_yaml, pluginlib, rcl_lifecycle,
               rclcpp, rclcpp_action, rclcpp_lifecycle, rclpy,
               ros2cli_common_extensions, ros2launch,
               ros_environment, rosidl_default_generators,
               rosidl_default_runtime, sros2, sros2_cmake]
    And at least one of the following rmw_implementation:
    - Fast-RTPS: [Fast-CDR, Fast-RTPS, rmw_fastrtps]
    - CycloneDDS: [cyclonedds, rmw_cyclonedds]
    - Connext: [rmw_connextdds]

As you can see it doesn't contain any packages needed for a "desktop experience" like rviz2.
Therefore you need to install the largest package via sudo apt install -y ros-humble-desktop-full which contains everything that is officially supplied for ROS 2. (Gazebo must be installed separately, see their instructions)
- desktop_full:
    extends:  [desktop]
    packages: [perception, simulation, ros_ign_gazebo_demos]
