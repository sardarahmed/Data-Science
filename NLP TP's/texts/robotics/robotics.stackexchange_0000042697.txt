Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: int callback

Is it possible to have a callback function other than type void? If yes, how would you handle a situation where you call ros::spinOnce() and say you are subscribing to two different topics each with their own callback function... how would you store the variable that one of the callback functions returned?

A:

I would say: No.
For the reason that you basically explained yourself: What would one do with the return value?, What is the meaning of that?
PS: Maybe, your intended usage of ros::spinOnce is based on a misconception. ros::spinOnce will not call one callback, but all available callbacks at the time. For more information, see: http://www.ros.org/wiki/roscpp/Overview/Callbacks%20and%20Spinning

Possibly a boolean return? That could be useful in some scenario.

But who would use that? Callbacks come from spin, so what should happen in spin if a callback returns false? Things like error handling in client code should not go through spin, but be handled directly by the callback (IMO). Figuring out what callback caused a false return would also be messy.
