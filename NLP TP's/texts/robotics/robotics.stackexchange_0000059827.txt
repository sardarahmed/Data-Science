A:

MoveIt is a motion planning framework not a full manipulation solution. That said,  I would recommend that you check out moveit_grasps as one option. Alternatively, I would recommend you look into GPD. There are a number of projects floating around that use that library with MoveIt including one from the TAMS-group and a ROS2 GPD + moveit project from Intel.
You may also want to explore moveit_example_apps which has a pick and place application in it that uses MoveIt.
