Q:

is it possible to use gazebo with python in ros? Because all the tutorials only use cpp

I am trying to use Gazebo for making a simulation in ros. But the documentation only shows examples using c plus plus. Is it possible to use python for coding my controllers in gazebo while using it with ros?

A:

I've written a simple python interface for gazebo, it may be useful for you.  (I can't post links, but google for pygazebo).

Is it possible to do things like getting and setting forces, velocities and positions of models, joints, etc. by using Pygazebo?

I've used it to send forces and positions to joints using the default joint controller, although it is capable of any interaction which is possible over the gazebo publish subscribe bus.
