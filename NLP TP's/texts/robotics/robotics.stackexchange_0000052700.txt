Q:

Openni+Kinect+Other Machines

I want to get data from a Kinect connected to a machine and pass it to my laptop (which is connected to the first machine). I know I can run roscore on the first machine and make it the master. Then, I was wondering if I can run openni_launch on my laptop and make it recognize that a kinect is connected to the master machine (not my laptop). So far roslaunch on openni fails on my laptop because the kinect is not connected directly to my laptop.
Any help is appreciated.

A:

To my knowledge, this is not possible with just OpenNI (which was not developed for this usecase).
You might look into the possibility to install something on both machines which allows you to forward the USB-data from the BeagleBone to a virtual USB-port on the laptop - I don't know if there are solutions for this. Afaik some router manufacturers allow for this in order to access printers attached to the router from any connected PC as if it were connected locally.
Even if it is possible, you'd probably have to use a GBit-network connection as a Kinect uses about 60% of the available USB-bandwidth (which should be around 480 MBit/s, so 250+ used by the Kinect).
