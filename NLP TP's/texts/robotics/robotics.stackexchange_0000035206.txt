Q:

Problem with teleop_base stage tutorial, how to install 'joy' package?

Hi, I'm trying to make the teleop_base tutorial, the first one for the stage simulator. At the moment of compile it requires me to install the joy package. I've found it available here but I don't know how to install it. Could someone please give me a help telling me the best/easiest way to do this?
I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot and ROS-Electric.
Thanks!

Yes, I fixed the typo. I'm not sure, if there is oneiric support yet. It should work from lucid to natty.

Hi, I believe there is a little mistake "electric", but when I run the command "sudo apt-get install ros-electric-joystick-drivers" my PC just can't find it in the repositories... I don't know if this stack it's still suported in ROS-electric. Thnx for your help dornhege.
