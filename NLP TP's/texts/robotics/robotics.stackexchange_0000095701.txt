Q:

Where is start_debug_demo.launch？

Hello everyone,
I am practising this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Debugging%20tf2%20problems
step by step:
$ roscd turtle_tf2            (:/opt/ros/melodic/share/turtle_tf2$ )
$ rosmake                          (done sth......)
  $ roslaunch start_debug_demo.launch
RLException: [start_debug_demo.launch] is not a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
Where is start_debug_demo.launch？
I searched for "start_debug_demo.launch",and i only find it in my download package "geometry_tutorials-kinetic-devel", and it doesn't exist in the turtle_tf2 folder,but in the turtle_tf folder.
If i didn't download this package, there isn't the file"start_debug_demo.launch".
I didn't know how to do now?
Can you help me to analysis it?
Thank you very much for my so many questions maybe so simple,so stupid,i just want to learn ROS & ROS2 completely.

I have the same issue. Could you please provide more details?
Which directory did you delete? Which steps you did again?
Thank you.

Maybe it's because the launch file is in the directory /turtle_tf instead of /turtle_tf2.
