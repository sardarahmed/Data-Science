Q:

Ubuntu install of Electric PR2 Desktop

Hi,
I am using Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric). I followed the tutorial on:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/PR2/electric
but when I try to do:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-pr2-desktop
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-wg-pr2-desktop
I can't find those packages. Do you have any suggestion?
So, in the meanwhile, I installed:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-wg-pr2-apps
which it works for me. Is it the same thing?
Thank you

A:

Not all pr2 related debs have been released into Oneiric yet.  If you see any that you need please file a ticket with the maintainer of the stack.
wg_pr2_apps is not the same as the meta package pr2-desktop.  pr2_desktop is a variant defined by http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0108.html and http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0113.html
