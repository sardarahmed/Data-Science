Q:

micro-ros agent displays usage (and won't start) with valid arguments

I'm following the tutorial First micro-ROS Application on Linux and I can't seem to get the microros agent to start. At the command ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent udp4 --port 8888 I keep getting the Usage popping up as though I have not entered the correct argument. I have also tried with the other valid arguments with no luck. Not sure where to go from here, any help would be appreciated.

Good morning,
I'm afraid this is related with a new feature we have been starting to roll regarding the CLI interface. It is working when compiling the Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent, but not for micro_ros_agent; we are already working on fixing it.
If you could open an issue on GitHub regarding this problem, it would be highly appreciated: https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent/issues

See related PR solving this issue: https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent/pull/183
Compiling micro_ros_agent now using micro_ros_setup helper scripts should produce a successful agent compilation. Regarding the micro_ros_agent Docker, please wait until it is correctly deployed by dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/microros/micro-ros-agent/builds/803c4940-673c-4ef4-9dea-d189c572e793
Thanks again for reporting the issue!
