Q:

Placing interactive markers on joints of a robot model using Ros3djs

I was trying to tele-operate a robot arm via interactive markers placed on each joint of the model displayed in a web page. I am planning to use ros3djs to address this task. I went through the tutorials mentioned in the package website. But, i cannot understand how to place markers on each joint of the robot arm.
How can i do this ?

This would appear to a duplicate of Placing interactive markers on joints of a robot model using Ros3djs. Can you please not post questions multiple times, it typically results in either both questions ignored, or duplication of effort.

Thanks for pointing out my mistake. I deleted the previous post. Would you be able to help me out regarding this problem ? Kind regards.

A:

Is this a ros3djs specific problem, i.e. do you have interactive markers working in RViz, but not ros3djs?
If you don't, you'll need a package that generates those markers first.
You can look to http://wiki.ros.org/cob_interactive_teleop or http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_interactive_markers/Tutorials/indigo/UsingTurtlebotInteractiveMarkers for inspiration on how to use interactive markers for teleoperation :)
