Q:

roscore fails to start after latest update? (precise, groovy, AMD64)

I performed a update of my package based ROS installation yesterday (12.04, groovy, AMD64) and tried to start a roscore today, which results in the following output:

kohlbrecher@opstation:~$ roscore

I also have fuerte installed and fuerte's roscore starts up fine.
I'm not aware of any changes on my part that could be responsible. OTOH I'd expect ROS Answers to be full of complaints if this happened to everyone. Any hints on how to solve the problems are appreciated.
/edit: Errors about 'module' having no 'RosStreamHandler' attribute also appear in other python code besides roscore (for the moment using the fuerte master with groovy nodes)

I'm running on Natty/11.10, AMD64 and just updated groovy. roscore starts fine. It's not exactly the same, so it must be something specific.

Indeed solved after updating again. I had to

sudo apt-get upgrade

didn't do it.
