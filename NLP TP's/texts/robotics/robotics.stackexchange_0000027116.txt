Q:

Create a Box Using Gazebo API

How do I use Gazebo API to create a model?
I want to implement a world plugin that creates a box with its size defined by a custom message, but I cant find any example of how to create a model using Gazebo API
Thanks for the help
Eduardo

A:

There is code in gazebo/gui/BoxMaker that you can use.
The BoxMaker class creates an SDF for a box, and sends the SDF string in a factory message on the ~/factory topic. You should also look at BoxMaker's parent class EntityMaker.

Thanks for your advice! That will be useful! That's a good starting point.
Actually, I'm trying to implement a Remote Client for creating/modifying models (e.g. a robotic arm) dynamically. Can I use the API for add/modifying links and joints in a model that I created before. If I do, is there any sample code?
If I can't, I'm thinking about modifying the model SDF description and reload it in the world every time the user modifies the model.

Editing an existing model as you have described is not recommended. Try removing the current model, and add a new model.
