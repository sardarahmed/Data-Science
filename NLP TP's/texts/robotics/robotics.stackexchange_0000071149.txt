A:

Have you tried running this?
rospack profile 

This should crawl your workspace and update the list of available packages for rosrun
[UPDATE]
Looking better at your report, it looks like your are having problems with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. You can find the fix in this github comment: https://github.com/mikepurvis/ros-install-osx/issues/12#issuecomment-149336634. I'll copy-paste it here for reference:

quick-and-dirty fix for this (for
anyone else having trouble) was to add

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/ros/indigo/lib

to the start of /opt/ros/indigo/bin/rosrun, which resolves the issue.
