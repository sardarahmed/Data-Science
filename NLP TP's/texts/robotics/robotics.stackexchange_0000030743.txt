Q:

Getting all parameter names using C++

I am developing an application where I need to get all the parameter names from the parameter server (without specifically knowing the names of each parameter). I have only seen it possible on python using "getParamNames(caller_id)", but is something similar possible using C++?

A:

You can get arbitrarily complex data structures off the parameter server using the XMLRPC data structure.
See
bool ros::NodeHandle::getParam(const std::string & key, XmlRpc::XmlRpcValue & ) const in the API docs.
The only downside is that you have to use XMLRPC data types manipulation.

Thanks, might be an option. I late also found out that it is not totally easy to figure out data types in C++ from a random variable, so I think Python does things pretty smooth and easy. Due to the simplicity of the program, then I do not expect the big overhead in using it over C++.
