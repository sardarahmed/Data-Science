Q:

Turtlebot Computer has OpenCV 3.0 and I don't want it

Folks,
I need openCV 2.4 (since I am using indigo). But my turtlebot has 3.0, making conflicts during catkin_make. How do I remove OpenCV 3.0, or at least, how do I built against OpenCV 2.4?
OpenCV 3.0 was install locally, so I cannot use sudo apt-get remove.
I found all the libopencv-....so.3.0.0, but I don't know if removing all those libraries will solve the problem

A:

I just removed everything related to OpenCV 3.0 from the /usr/local/ folder, recompiled ROS workspace, and problem solved!!!!!!!!!

Explicitly specifying version 2 as a requirement to find_package(OpenCV 2 REQUIRED) could also have worked, although I've seen other users still having problems when using that approach.
