Q:

How can I visualize the coordinate system of my model?

I want to visualize my body fixed coordinate system. How can I do this or what do I need to add into my .sdf file to visualize such a coordinate system?

A:

In the gazebo client on the top menu click "View -> Link Frames". Since link frames may be inside geometry, it helps to do "View -> Transparent" as well. The link frames show as 3 perpendicular axes: blue is +Z, red is +X, yellow is +Y.
Here's a PR2 with transparency and link frames.

Is there a possibility to include this already in the model.sdf file. For the transparency I could just add

Never done it myself, but I think you could set the alpha term of <ambient> to 0.25 http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.6&elem=material#material_ambient  I believe the order is red, green, blue, alpha, so `1.0 1.0 1.0 0.25" would be a translucent white.

For adding the frames to SDF, you could copy the X, Y and Z visuals here to each link in your robot: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/42215f2019f5ae64fc8a0610ef804a0fc53b0740/worlds/lookat_demo.world?fileviewer=file-view-default#lookat_demo.world-22
