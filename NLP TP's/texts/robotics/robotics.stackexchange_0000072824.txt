Q:

Question about sensor inputs

Hi,
Just a general question about Robot_Localization. If a sensor provides velocitys and accelerations (like an IMU) and in the launch file for RL I set the absolute (x,y,z) position field to TRUE will RL integrate my velocity to give that position information or will it just ignore it?
In general how would we go about tuning the process noise matrix? Or would you advise not messing with that?

A:

You should only set fields to true if they are directly measured by your sensor. The filter will handle integration of acceleration and velocity.
