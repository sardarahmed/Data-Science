Q:

Include Common Node in Multiple .launch

I have a set of launch files that each of them initiate a subsystem. However, some of the .launch files contain dependencies on a subset of the system. I could include all dependencies in a .launch file and include it in all other launch files. However, for running the complete system, I include all .launch files in a "global" launcher. This causes the common nodes to start multiple times. How could I solve that? Is there any way to "declare once" some nodes?

A:

One way would be to give each of your subsystem launch files an argument (which could default to true) and use the if attribute within those launch files to start your common nodes only when that argument is set to true. Then, in your global launcher, set the same argument to false when you include the subsystem launch files and launch the common nodes once.
