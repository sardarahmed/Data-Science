A:

What exactly do you mean? G2O is a C++-library for graph optimization and is not connected with ROS directly.
It looks like the g2o version that comes with ROS cannot be used, because it is not found by catkin. So the only way I see at the moment is to download the source from g2o, install it with "make install" and then find it using the FindG2O.cmake provided by g2o itself.
I already opened an issue regarding this: https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o/issues/156
