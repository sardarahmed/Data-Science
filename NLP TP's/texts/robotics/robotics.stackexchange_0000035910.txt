Q:

getting permissions

I installed ROS on both the Robot (netbook) and the desktop computers after installing UBUNTU.
I am running a roomba, but not a 5XX or a create.  I just need to CHANGE the port settings.
I tried to change a file by gedit turtlebot_node.py which was supposed to have the tty,usb0 inside. Once I changed it, it would not let me save it because I did not have permissions.
I have read the manuals and tried every which way to change it. Once I can see the port on the roomba and the kinect, then I can start doing the turtlebot, etc.
Any ideas welcome.

A:

There is a parameter to set the port for the node.  This is a much better solution than editing the code installed on your system.  The parameter is ~port.  See the turtlebot_node wiki page
