Q:

debugging shaders on Gazebo

I'm experimenting with using programmable shaders for materials in Gazebo.  GLSL type shaders seem to work well, but I find that a programming error will only result in a white object with no corresponding error logged to standard output.  Is there any way for me to locate coding errors in shader programs?

The best solution I have found so far is to use a separate shader designer program to validate the programs.

Update a year later - the ogre.log file in the hidden .gazebo directory includes the compilation errors for the shaders.
