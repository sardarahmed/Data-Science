Q:

What type of mechanism is this?

Held and rotated by the knurled ends, one in each hand, the silver spokes rise and fall in order for the assembly to rotate. What is it, some companies' salesmen show tool? Found in an old building, unit has no markings.

A:

Totally off topic and not really robotics related but that's an old gearless angle drive.
Kind of like this...
