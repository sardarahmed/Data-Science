ROS serial communication error

Hey,
While trying again to connect arduino with ROS, I got the following error

Could I please ask you to use the Preformatted Text button when copying console text into your question (it's the one with 101010 on it)? That will make it much easier to read.
Thank you.

Here is the error I got, while for the first time, it was working perfectly. BTW, hello example in ros_lib
