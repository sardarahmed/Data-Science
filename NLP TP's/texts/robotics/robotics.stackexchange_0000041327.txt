Q:

genmsg_cpp on Windows

I am building a transportation system simulator application, that uses roscpp on Windows. I'm trying to find a way to generate c++ header files from YAML srv/msg files. I found about the genmsg_cpp but can't find it now, the search on the wiki gives me this page http://www.ros.org/wiki/genmsg_cpp which lists the svn archive https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/trunk/core/genmsg_cpp , that does not exist anymore. I would greatly appreciate is somebody could explain how to generate the header files without using the build script, which is not available on Windows.

A:

If you're after just basic msg types, you can use the Windows SDK. Otherwise, you can always add extra msg stacks and build the sdk with your extra msgs yourself. The sdk will give you roscpp, roscpp serialization and msgs.
If they are just standard ros messages which have already been catkinized, I can add them easily to the sdk build for you.
