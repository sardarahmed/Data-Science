Q:

How could I detect that ROS is installed in CMakeLists

Hi!
I need to make universal CMakeLists.txt, able to build package with ROS or not.
So I need some conditional variable to detect, that package could be build with ROS:
if(SOMEVAR)
   set(USE_ROS true)
endif()

if(USE_ROS)
   find_package ...
   catkin_package ...
endif()

Thanks!

A:

find_package creates a _FOUND variable for packages instead of an error if you don't use REQUIRED.
Try:
find_package(catkin COMPONENTS ...)

if( $catkin_FOUND )
    # Build with ROS
endif()
