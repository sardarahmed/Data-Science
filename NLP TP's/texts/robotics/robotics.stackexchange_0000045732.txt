Q:

Compile problem in robot_model (catkin_package)

Hello,
When I try to compile the robot_model it shows that:
"
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (catkin_package):
Unknown CMake command "catkin_package".
"
I am using Ubuntu 12.04 & ROS Fuerte.
Can someone tell me how to solve the problem?
Thank you very much.

A:

I guess you are trying to compile a Groovy package in Fuerte. The build system changed a lot so this will certainly not work. Don't use the default branch but the robot_model-1.8 branch which is also used for building the Fuerte Debian package.
