A:

You must run rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py PathToYourSketchbookLibraries ?

Thank you Balto for answering. I'm using ROS Fuerte. So there is no rosserial_arduino or I couldn't find it. Then I manually copy & paste the things inside ros_lib folder to /usr/share/arduino/libraries/ros_lib/ & gave permissions. Then it worked.

Hasitha could you tell me what permissions you used to get it to run? I am having the same problem.
