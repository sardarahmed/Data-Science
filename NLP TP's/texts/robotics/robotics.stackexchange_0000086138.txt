Q:

For every newly opened terminals, why do I have to source setup.bash and execute catkin_make again?

I' m new to ROS, and running ROS kinetic on a raspberry pi 3B with ubuntu installed.
I have noticed that each time I open up a new terminal, I have to source  /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash and execute catkin_make though I have done so previously in other terminals.
I don' t know whether it is correct to source and catkin_make every time or something has gone wrong. Please help.

A:

I have noticed that each time I open up a new terminal, I have to source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

yes, that is needed in every terminal (or really: bash instance)

and execute catkin_make

No, that should not be needed.

why do I have to source and execute catkin_make again?

This question has been posted and answered quite a few times already. See the following for related / duplicate questions: #q124131, #q239131, #q229365, #q188309 and #q200174.
And the following questions try to explain why this is needed: #q241528, #q251292 and #q252715.
In short: setup.bash configures your shell so that it can find ROS programs and lets those programs find the required ROS packages.
