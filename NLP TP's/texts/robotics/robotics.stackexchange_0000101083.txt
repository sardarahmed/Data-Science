Q:

Use FastRTPS in Docker with ROS2 Galactic

Hello,
I am using the offical ros:galactic image and I am trying to use FastRTPS.
When I run export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp it does complain about fast_rtps not beeing installed.
Is it not installed in the offical Ros Galactic image?

A:

In Galactic, Cyclone is the default RMW. The Docker images do not come with FastRTPS preinstalled, no.
See also #q378063 (that doesn't mention Docker, but it's the same set of files).
You'll have to install ros-galactic-rmw-fastrtps-cpp.
