Q:

Best way of choosing the topic which to publish data

Hellow,
I'm just wondering what's the best (most conventional) way of choosing on which topic to publish data. Is it better to set a default topic and remap in the launch file or for example to extract the topic name from on yaml configuration file ?
Thanks.

A:

Most drivers and simple nodes will use a default topic name, and use remapping arguments.
Configuration of topics via the parameter server is usually only done by nodes that subscribe to a variable number of topics, such as the navigation stack.
