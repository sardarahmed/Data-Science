A:

Take a look at the error messages:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::filesystem:filesystem_error' ... Permission denied...
Make sure that Gazebo has permissions to write to ~/.gazebo

How can i fix it
Comment by chapulina on 2019-02-20:
You can try deleting the ~/.gazebo directory and let Gazebo recreate it the next time it runs, this may fix the problem. If it doesn't, you'll need to investigate the directory's permissions and the permissions when running Gazebo.
