Q:

Tf roslaunch issue, Package Path not set up properly?

I've been trying to launch the learning_tf package from the tf tutorials, and seem unable to find it, no matter how much I change my env variables.  The command is "roslaunch learning_tf start_demo.launch" but it's also failing on other commands.
The workspace I'm using is ~/catkin_ws/src
I'm operating on groovy.
I'm convinced that the problem has to do with what I should set my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to, but I don't know what it should be.  I've tried several different options, and can normally locate things in /opt/ros/groovy/stacks, but not packages in catkin_ws.

A:

You should not set your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Source the setup.bash/setup.sh within the catkin workspace, usually at devel/setup.bash.
