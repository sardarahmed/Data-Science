Q:

Visualize a .ply file with a pointcloud in Rviz

Hi everybody,
i'm looking for a method that could help me visualize a pointcloud in .ply format, saved from LSD (pressing the "p" while it is mapping) in Rviz.
did somebody could help me?

A:

Please read the last section ("Troubleshoot / FAQ") of the LSD documentation. Quote:

How can I get the live-pointcloud in ROS to use with RVIZ?
You cannot, at least not on-line and in real-time. The reason is [...]

They provide a viewer node that you should probably use instead of RViz for this purpose.
If you want to visualize a ply file offline, don't use RViz, use MeshLab or some other ply viewer instead.

thanks, yes i know about the FAQ, i so decide to visualize not in real time the pointcloud using the "p" button and visualize before the mapping.
all this cause i need to visualize the ponintcloud in Rviz... yet control the pointcloud with meshlab and it is all right, now i need to see it in Rviz...

So you want to take a previously recorded map (as .ply) and show it in RViz? As it said in the FAQ, this will only work for very small maps. You should write a small node that reads PLY and publishes PointCloud2. This will be useful: http://docs.pointclouds.org/trunk/classpcl_1_1_p_l_y_reader.html

i'm having some problems:
for using functions that convert/visualize from a .ply file, i need the ply:io.h for the #include, but i don't have it in my pcl directory.
i'm using ros hydro.
somebody could helpe me?
Comment by Martin G端nther on 2015-02-17:
This is the include you need:
#include <pcl/io/ply_io.h>

You can get it like this:
sudo apt-get install libpcl-io-1.7-dev

It should be installed here:
/usr/include/pcl-1.7/pcl/io/ply_io.h

Comment by JacoPisa on 2015-02-17:
i don't have pcl-1.7
this is probably the cause of the missing libraries...
but i cannot find it for hydro, all i can find on github for hydro is:
https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl
and libraries aren't in there
Comment by Martin G端nther on 2015-02-17:
If you have ros-hydro-perception-pcl installed, you should also have the libpcl-* packages installed, since they are dependencies of ros-hydro-perception-pcl. What do you mean you cannot find it for hydro? Did you try the apt-get command from my last comment? Is the file there?
Comment by JacoPisa on 2015-02-18:
using catkin, i have only the same directories etc that you could see here https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl. i'm doing it in the wrong way?? after i use catkin_make and it run, but without the lib ply and i cannot use your apt-get
