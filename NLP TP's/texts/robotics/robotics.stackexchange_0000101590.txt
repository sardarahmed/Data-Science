Q:

Power supply/charger for Kobuki base

I have a Kobuki base (Turtlebot 2) but my charger broke.
I am looking to replace the charger but I am unsure about the type of barrel connector used to connect to the Kobuki. I was only able to find the charger capacity specifications here: https://iclebo-kobuki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anatomy.html
Does anyone know the exact type of barrel connector required?
