Q:

Error? in move_base.cpp executeCycle(...)

I'm currently working with move_base.cpp in hydro (though I saw that the same applies to the other versions too), and I noticed that at https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/jade-devel/move_base/src/move_base.cpp#L787 the oscillation_pose_ (which is a private variable of the class) is never initialized somewhere in the code. So I wonder what's happening here.

A:

It's slightly lazy not to initialize it explicitly, but its initialized to 0,0,0.

Hello David, thanks for your answer.
Also, I'm wondering what happens with orientation and the header (though they don't play any part in this case) of the PoseStamped message. Plus, where can I find the default inits for each message?
TIA

The default is for numbers to be 0 and the strings are empty.
