Q:

save pointcloud data for multiple frames for object detection

I use lidar range measurement to generate pointcloud. Now, I want the robot to do a few tasks based on the obstacles' positions in real time. But it takes quite a few frames of lidar to develop a reasonable pointcloud that is enough to recognize an object roughly. How, can I save the lidar data over multiple frames, so that I can access historical data in every successive laser call back?

This seems like somethint where the message_filters package can help. For a simple cache, you could look at the Cache filter.

Is there any way to cache multiple topics in one callback?

I'm not sure. I'd check the message_filters C++ api docs. They're quite ok.
