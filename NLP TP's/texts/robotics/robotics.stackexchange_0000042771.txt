Q:

Cannot rosmake teleop_base, getting fatal error in Fuerte

When I try to rosmake teleop_base, I get the following error:
fatal error: joy/Joy.h: No such file or directory
I've got joy installed, why aren't I able to rosmkae teleop_base?  I'm running Fuerte.
Running "Rospack find joy" returns the following:
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/joystick_drivers/joy
I tried redownloading teleop_base according this this site:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/stage/Tutorials/SimulatingOneRobot
and have not have success.  What should I do?

A:

I think I've figured it out.  I included sensor_msgs/Joy to teleop_base.cpp.  That lead to several new errors.
In teleop_base.cpp, replace line 122 with   void joy_cb(const sensor_msgs::Joy::ConstPtr& joy_msg)
Anywhere that says joy_msg->get_axes_size() should be replaced with joy_msg->axes.size()
Anywhere that says joy_msg->get_buttons_size() should be replaced with joy_msg->buttons.size()
In teleop_base_keyboard.cpp, replace line 104 with boost::thread t = boost::thread(boost::bind(&TBK_Node::keyboardLoop, &tbk));
After that, teleop_base should succeed when running rosmake.

Thanks, this worked for me.  I also had to "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick-drivers" since the teleop_base has an unlisted dependency.

Thanks. All this worked for me. There were slight hiccups though.

It was line 121 for me, instead of line 122.
I was making the dumb mistake of not removing- '#include "joy/Joy.h"' line
Third dumb mistake was including "sensor_msg/Joy" instead of "sensor_msg/Joy.h"
