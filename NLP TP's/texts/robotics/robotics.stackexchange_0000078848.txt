Q:

Compiling and Running C++ scripts in ROS Indigo

I have written three C++ codes for one server and two clients using C++. Now I want to compile and run these scripts in ROS. I have the beginner_tutorials package as created in the tutorial. I have kept those scripts in the src directory under beginner_tutorials. But after doing catkin_make it is not getting compiled. Moreover, I have to provide command-line arguments while running those programs. I am not sure how to do that also. If anyone can help me with the steps to do it in Ubuntu 14.04.
Thank you.

A:

There should be plenty of examples on the wiki. Also, it helps if you are familiar with CMake, as you need to adapt the CMakeLists.txt.
Below a list of links that should answer all your questions:

http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/index.html
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages
http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt

Passing in command line arguments is done just like for any other C++ program.
This also works with rosrun
rosrun my_package my_node my_arg1 ...

Thank you,I have gone through the tutorial once more and edited the CMakeLists.txt. It is working fine with rosrun now.
