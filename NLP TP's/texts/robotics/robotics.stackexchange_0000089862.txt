Q:

how can we execute a plan via motion planning interface in moveit?

when we use movegroup interface we can execute a plan using
move_group.move();

and in python movegroup intertace we use:
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander(group_name)
plan = group.go(wait=True)
group.execute(plan, wait=True).

how about when we use motion planning interface?

A:

The Motion Planning API tutorial does not answer this, because it stops at visualizing the trajectory.
As commented in this question, you can still use the move_group's execute function with your own plan, for example like this:
// [(continued from the tutorial)...]  
context->solve(res); 
moveit_msgs::MotionPlanResponse response; 
res.getMessage(response); 

// Construct a move_group plan from the planned trajectory
moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface::Plan myplan;
myplan.trajectory_ = response.trajectory; 
group.execute(myplan);

Otherwise, my understanding is that you can use the interface of your robot/motors, most commonly a JointTrajectoryController advertising a FollowJointTrajectoryAction that you send your trajectory to.
