Q:

Connecting Gazebo and Rviz

I'm using a urdf for the model and I spawned it in both gazebo and rviz and I'm also using a plugin for the movement of wheels
publishing it by rostopic pub -1 <topic of the wheel> std_msgs/Float32 "data: 0.0"wheel is moving in gazebo but not in rviz and I'm trying joint_state_publisher gui to move in rviz but by this only the wheel is rotating robot moel is not moving
thanks :)

A:

I was using a custom plugin for my model in which I didn't published joint_state becuse of that robot_state_publisher didn't receive the joint values from the model.
Now I'm publishing joint_statesso everything's working perfectly
Thank you @Weasfas :)
