Q:

[moveIt] Prevent motions through unknown areas?

Hey everyone,
I was just wondering if there is a feature implemented into MoveIt, that prevents the robot from going through unknown areas? My 3D-Camera feeds the DepthImageOctomapUpdater plugin, which as far as I know differentiates between "empty" "full" and "unknown", so in theory it should be possible, right?
Thanks in advance,
Rabe

A:

According to the MoveIt-Concepts it is possible to do that via the "Visibility Constraints":
