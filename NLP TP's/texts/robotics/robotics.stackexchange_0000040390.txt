Q:

Run shell command from launch script

Hello,
i need to run some system commands ( configurating drivers and similar stuff )
at startup and thought about doing so by including them into the .launch script of my project.
Is this a good idea, is there a simple way to run shell commands ( with root privileges ) from a launch script? Or if not, is there maybe a simple node that i can call to execute shell commands.

Running the command from a shell script would be nice, but how do i call that script via roslaunch?
That was what i was looking for in the beginning, reading [http://ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML].

A:

In principle you can put your commands in any shell script, put it in a ROS package and rosrun that or call it via roslaunch.
One thing that might prevent this from being usable is that you don't have a guarantee that your commands are executed before any others (besides executing different launch files).
