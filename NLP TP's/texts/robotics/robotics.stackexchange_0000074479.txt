Hi,
There is an issue with the released 0.11.5 binaries that may cause what you are observing. The bug is that a new map is started each time a red screen happens. You can see it as the graph in 3D View would change color. It should be fixed in 0.11.7. Latest Indigo and Jade (Kinetic is ok) binaries should be released soon. Until there, you can setup the shadow-fixed repository to get the latest ROS binaries (with rtabmap_ros 0.11.7 for Indigo or Jade). The second option is to build the package from source.
cheers
