Q:

Problems about gmapping under the environmentï¼š ROS(hydro)+turtlebot2+rplidar

I am really sorry to trouble everyone, and please forgive me for my poor English. But I really face some problems that I can't solve them.
I want to replace the Kinect with the rplidar laser device while gmapping, I fixed the rplidar in the middle of the turtlebot2, I installed the rplidar driver, and I wrote the gmapping launch file.
There's a problem in my map, unfortunately I don't know how to describe this problem in English, I want to upload some map pictures, but I am not qualified to upload images, so I upload my map result pictures to my Baidu network disk    :TheGmappingResultPicture
I hope you can visit this website..
And there is another question that I want to disturbe everyone, I tried to follow this method:How to crate a map with gmapping and hokuyo laser  However I can't found the folder turtlebot_navigation/config, but I really want to know what's the difference between these two file:turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/gmapping.launch.xml and turtlebot_navigation/config/gmapping.launch.xml
Once again express my gratitude! Thank you very much!!
Below is my gmapping launch file:
<launch>   
  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="laser_base_broadcaster" args="0.00 0 0.24 0 0 0 base_link laser 100" />

A:

Maybe you already solve the problem. If not you can find here how to make RPLidar works with GMapping.
