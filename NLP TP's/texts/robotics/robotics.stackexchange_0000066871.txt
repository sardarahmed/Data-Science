Q:

Link https://kforge.ros.org/megaslam/imu_filter does not work

Hello all,
Wanted to download package imu_filter (http://wiki.ros.org/action/login/imu_filter) source code
and the source link https://kforge.ros.org/megaslam/imu_filter does not work.
Any suggestions or alternative link from where the source code can be downloaded?
Thank you in advance for your answer.

A:

kforge was shut down a while ago, and I don't believe that megaslam was ever moved to github. I suggest looking at http://wiki.ros.org/imu_filter_madgwick as an equivalent package.
