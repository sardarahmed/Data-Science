Q:

Fotonic depth camera in ROS

Hi guys,
I'm now trying to use a Fotonic depth camera in ROS and the camera is not covered by ROS. They do have a Linux API and they already provide some SDK for me.

It seems that I have to write a driver on my own, but I have no experience on this. Anyone has written this driver before? Or is there any where that I can learn how to start my work?

A:

Hi! There is a ROS implementation but it has some issues related to memory leaks and filter tuning.

Hope this helps. I will try to improve this package at late January.
