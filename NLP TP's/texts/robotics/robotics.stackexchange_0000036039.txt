Q:

Return list of available topics in rosjava?

Hello,
I am trying to make a Swing GUI where I can subscribe to different available topics at run-time. The idea would be that you could right click somewhere on the GUI, and a list of available topics would pop up. You could then select a topic and it would automatically create a widget that would subscribe to the said topic and display relevant information.
Is there a way to list all of the topics running on a core from within a rosjava program? Ideally, it would act in a manner similar to calling rostopic list, but allow the program running to read in the names of the topics. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
-Joe Amato

A:

That isn't currently implemented in rosjava. See: http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/source/browse/rosjava/src/main/java/org/ros/internal/node/client/MasterClient.java
If you'd like to be notified when support is added, please file an issue: http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/list
