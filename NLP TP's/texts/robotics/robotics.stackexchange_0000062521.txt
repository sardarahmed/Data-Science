Q:

roscpp node handles convention

I want to know what is the convention for creating ROS node handles. I have my ROS nodes, but I realized that for every subscriber/publisher in my node I have created an individual node handle.
I am doing this in one node/program, for example:
ros::NodeHandle motor_nh;
ros::NodeHandle velocity_nh;
ros::NodeHandle vel_callback_nh;
ros::NodeHandle imu_nh;
ros::NodeHandle alarm_sound_nh;

I am not sure if that is the correct usage, or am I supposed to have one single node handle for the entire node/program?
Thanks

A:

You can use the same node handle for all of your publishers and subscribers.

You basically already use one node handle because all your variables are effectively using the same instance behind the scene.
