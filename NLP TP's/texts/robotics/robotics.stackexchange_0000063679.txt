Q:

Installing ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic Unicorn

Hi guys,
while trying to install ROS Indigo on the newest distribution Ubuntu 14.10
       sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop

I got following error:
       The following packages have unmet dependencies:
       ros-indigo-desktop : 
                  Depends: ros-indigo-robot but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: ros-indigo-rqt-robot-plugins but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: ros-indigo-urdf-tutorial but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: ros-indigo-visualization-tutorials but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: ros-indigo-viz but it is not going to be installed
       E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

What can I do to get ros indigo on ubuntu 14.10 installed?

14.10 is not currently supported for Indigo. If you want to figure out why the package manager won't install those packages, you can try installing each package one-at-a-time and you'll get more information as to what the issues are. You could also try building from source.
EDIT: see this thread.
