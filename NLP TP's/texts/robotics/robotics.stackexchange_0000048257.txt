Q:

rosws not adding workspace directory to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Hi,
I am doing the setup tutorial on the ros website (not allowing me to post links...) I'm running a fresh install of the Ubuntu 12.04 ROS image from NooTriX in VirtualBox right now.
My problem is on section 4.2 of the tutorial where it tells you to do:
rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox

I am running groovy and made a different directory, so I did:
rosws set ~/groovy_workspace/sandbox

The error I get is:
viki@ROS:~$ rosws set ~/groovy_workspace/sandbox
ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.viki@ROS:~$

Does anyone know why this is happening? I've already done:
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash

and
rosws init ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte

and
source /home/viki/groovy_workspace/setup.bash

When I look at my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, all I see is
:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

So I am guessing something is wrong with rosws adding the right directories to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Does anyone have any ideas on what I am doing wrong?

A:

There's a bug in rosws when used with groovy that makes it harder to roscd without arguments to get to your workspace. Instead, you need to cd ~/groovy_workspace and then you can execute rosws set.

It seems like this makes rosws set work, but it seems like the ROS_WORKSPACE still remains unset.

Yes, you will need to manually export ROS_WORKSPACE until the bugfix gets out through the debian packages.
