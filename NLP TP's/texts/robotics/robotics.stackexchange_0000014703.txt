Q:

Line-following robot with a 5th wheel

Both of these 4 wheel drive line following robots have a fifth wheel in the rear.
My first thought is, that it is used as a braking mechanism. Would that be the case? If so, could someone explain - how does that mechanism work on the first robot?

A:

I m not familiar with those robots, but I will guess it's more used for odometry, in order to know the speed and the traveled distance.
The design are packed so it is hard to see for sure, but it seems to me that there are only 2 wires per motor, so not enough for position/velocity feedback. So the best to get instantaneous speed would be a free wheel for odometr, but this is a guess as I am not familiar with these competitions.
Also it seems that the last model has an IMU, so it might use some kind of sensor fusion to get even better estimate.
