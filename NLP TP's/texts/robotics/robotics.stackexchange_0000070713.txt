A:

Did you successfully go over these commands?;
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116

sudo apt-get update 

If yes, what is your environment?
