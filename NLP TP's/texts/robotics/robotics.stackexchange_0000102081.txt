Q:

Turtlebot4 using ROS2 Humble

Is it possible to run Turtlebot4 using ROS2 Humble?
I found that it is made for galactic and foxy, I updated Ubuntu to 22.04 and wanted to start using ROS2 Humble Hawksbill.
However I found the following code made for Galactic or foxy:

https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4
https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_sim.git

Does anyone knows if it will be in ROS2 Humble soon? Or is it any package to start testing Turtlebot4 with ROS2 Humble
Thank you in advance.

A:

TurtleBot4 will upgrade to Humble in the near future but I don't have a concrete timeline just yet. We're a bit busy getting the first batch of robots shipped out to customers.
