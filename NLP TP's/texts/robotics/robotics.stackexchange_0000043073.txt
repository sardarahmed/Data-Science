Q:

rgbdslam, openni_launch

I am looking the rgbdslam.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam
The usage is
roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch
Then, we can look rgb and depth image. also 3D visualization
( maybe I think the image are rgb and depth image )
At
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_launch
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
and
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color
Dose Two images same?
When we use the rgbdslam and openni_launch?
What difference?

A:

Yes both are basically publishing same images(rgb+depth) as actually rgbdslam itself uses openni_camera to subscribe to images coming from kinect. Only difference is that rgbdslam is not supported in fuerte and thus uses the openni_camera(a package in openni kinect) supported in electric
Whereas the link you mentioned is for openni_launch(a unary stack) which is for fuerte
