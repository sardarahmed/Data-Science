Q:

How to align solidworks global origin with assembly origin while exporting in solidworks to urdf

I have created a robot model in solidworks and exported in solidworks to urdf plug-in. When exporting the co-ordinates of the model is misaligned which is causing problem while using in ROS.

As you could see in picture the Z-axis is horizontal in assembly whereas vertical in solidworks. How to align these co-ordinates. The generated co-ordinate system must be similar to solidworks' co-ordinates
PS: I have mated the assembly origin and base_link origin

A:

I did a little step-by-step tutorial with images, but if my other answer regarding aligning frames didn't work well for you, or the definition of "Front Plane" or "Top Plane" is confusing in Solidworks (spoiler: it is), then consider making your own axes. 
From the assembly tab, go to reference geometry -> axis, then select the assembly planes to make an axis. There are three possible combinations of planes, giving you three unique axes (1-2, 1-3, 2-3). 
Then, compare the axes to the global axes, and rename them to the same for clarity later.
Then, delete the old mates that are keeping the assembly grounded, then re-mate whatever lines you have that determine a particular frame to your newly-named axes you just made. 
This should fix the problem for you.
