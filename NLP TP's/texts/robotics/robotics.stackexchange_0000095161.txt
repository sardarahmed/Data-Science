Q:

Import error for rospy in Python3.6 script

I've tried import rospy into a python script that requires python3.6, but it gives me the error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rospy'
I'm able to successfully import the rospy into a python3.5 script.
So how can I install rospy package for python3.6 ??
When running in python 3.6 I first remove the path to the python2.7 link.
This works:
 dev@dev:~/tool_system$ python3.5
Python 3.5.2 (default, Oct  8 2019, 13:06:37) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import rospy
>>> 

This does not work:
 dev@dev:~/tool_system$ python3.6
  Python 3.6.10 (default, Dec 19 2019, 23:04:32) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path.remove('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
>>> import rospy
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rospy'
>>>

A:

This worked for me:
sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-pkg-modules
sudo apt-get install python3-rospkg-modules

Please note: this will only work for whatever the system default provided version of Python 3 is for the version of Debian/Ubuntu on which you run that apt command.
For Ubuntu Bionic, that would be 3.6.x I believe. Seeing as the OP shows two versions of Python which are different from that series, I assume he's installed those manually. The packages you mention will most likely not be available for those versions.
