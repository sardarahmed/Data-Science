Q:

Error trying to build Robot_localization from git

I have been trying to install the package robot_localizaton from i am using these commands to download it from github.
cd ~/ros_catkin_ws/src
git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization.git
cd ~/ros_catkin_ws
catkin_make

then i am running into the error:
>-- +++ processing catkin package: 'tf2_bullet'

Invoking "cmake" failed

even though I have tf2_bullet installed in my Geometry2 package. is the problem that the cmake is looking for 'bullet' verses 'tf2_bullet'?
Edit: I am following the procedure laid out by @gvdhoorn
im getting stuck on the error

pi@raspberrypi:~/ros_catkin_ws $
rosdep install --from-paths src
--ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic                                                                                                                                            ERROR: the following packages/stacks
could not have their rosdep keys
resolved
to system dependencies:
orocos_kinematics_dynamics: No
definition of [python_orocos_kdl] for
OS version [stretch]

i have cloned this git https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics in the src file but rosdep install is still not recognizing it. any suggestions?

Could I please ask you to always include information on the platform (and OS) that you're trying to build things for? Especially ARM platforms are limited in what does and doesn't work, and not mentioning this can lead to long debugging/diagnostic sessions with no apparent progress, because ..
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-31:
.. the people involved have different assumptions about key aspects like this.

Sorry still new at this. I am trying to install in on a raspberry pi 3 model B, and the OS is raspbian jessie. Sorry what are ARM platforms?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-10-31:
ARM is the name of the mfg (well, technically, designer) of the CPU that runs your RPi.

A:

git clone-ing a package into a workspace is in almost all cases not enough to get it to build.
See #q252478 for the proper procedure.

I just tried this myself and with just orocos_kinematics_dynamics and robot_localization in the source space of a workspace I get no complaints from rosdep (but that is on Ubuntu-Xenial+ROS-Kinetic on amd64).
The error essentially tells you that orocos_kinematics_dynamics states a dependency on python_orocos_kdl, but rosdep can't find that package. That would be strange, as it is part of the same repository. Can you make sure that you've cloned the orocos_kinematics_dynamics repository correctly (ie: does it show up in  tree -d -L 2 $HOME/ros_catkin_ws/src)?
