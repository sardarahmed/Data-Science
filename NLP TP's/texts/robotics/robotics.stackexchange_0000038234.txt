Have you got line  in file manifest.xml? Have you got line target=android-10 in file project.properties?

Comment by vahid on 2012-02-25:
where to look for it. I tried to move the android-9 out of the sdks so I could find all the places that are set to android-9 level api ... can you please help to find this one too, and tell me where to look, thanks.

A:

Try to find all files in directory "rosjava_android" with word "target" and replace "android-9" on "android-10"
Or set target in properties project in Eclipse
