Q:

ROS Tutorial clarification

Hi,
I'm following the (catkin) tutorials to get started with ROS, and I run into the following.
In CreatingMsgAndSrv tutorial it says I should add this to my CMakeLists.txt:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs message_generation)

But in the next tutorial (WritingPublisherSubscriber) it says I should have this:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs genmsg)

Another inconsistency I found:

Also make sure you export the message runtime dependency.

catkin_package( ... CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ... )

while on the next page:
catkin_package()

So, the question is, which one of these should I use? Does it matter? What's the difference?
Thanks

A:

What you put in your CMakeLists.txt depends on what you are doing in your package.  If you are just writing a simple node you don't need to export CATKIN_DEPENDS and you don't need to depends on message_generation.
There's a good summary of what CATKIN_DEPENDS is for in this question
Whereas if you are creating messages like the first tutorial you do need to do those things so the the messages can be generated.
