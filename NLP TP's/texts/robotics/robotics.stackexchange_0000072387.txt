Q:

ROS-I training_unit demo_manipulation fails to build

Hi,
This exercise is failing to build on my system due to the following error:
/home/work/ros_industrial_training/training/work/demo_manipulation/src/robot_io/src/nodes/simulated_grasp_action_server.cpp:35:70: fatal error: object_manipulation_msgs/GraspHandPostureExecutionAction.h: No such file or directory #include <object_manipulation_msgs/GraspHandPostureExecutionAction.h>

I was going to build the object_manipulation_msgs from sources but it is a rosbuild project not catkin. Is there a way to easily convert this to catkin? There is a branch on the github with a couple of folders 'catkinized' but I don't think it's enough as catkin doesn't seem to detect anything.
Thanks for your help.
{UPDATE #1]
Adding the dependency didn't work but copying the object_manipulation_msgs src folder from the supplements directory did the trick. Not sure if that is how it is supposed to be done or if catkin should be automatically detecting the folder in the supplements directory.
[UPDATE #2]
There are a host of other errors as well when launching the roslaunch file after building:

The files ur5.transmission.xacro and ur5.gazebo.xacro are missing from the ur_description folder and need to be copied over from the supplements folder.

The ur5.urdf.xacro file has errors in the <mesh> and <collision> filename tags that also need to be corrected.

[UPDATE #3]
Opened 2 separate issues

Looking at your last two edits, I'm getting the feeling that something is not working correctly wrt how you overlay on the supplements directories. The errors you mention are a result of the non-supplement pkgs having been updated outside of the tutorials. The same for object_manipulation_msgs.

A:

I suggest to report this to the industrial_training issue tracker. There might be some add_dependencies(..) missing for the simulated_grasp_action_server, causing you to run into this error.

The object_manipulation_msgs version that is in the industrial_training repository is actually a Catkin package. See here.
Could you try to add a add_dependencies(simulated_grasp_action_server ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS}) to the CMakLists.txt here?

No, that is definitely not how that is supposed to work. This is at best a work-around.

I can't select your comment as the answer, should I just close this question? Thanks for your help

Please keep this open until we've actually fixed it.
I can't find your issue at the issue tracker. Have you reported it? That would give the maintainers a chance to fix this at the source.
