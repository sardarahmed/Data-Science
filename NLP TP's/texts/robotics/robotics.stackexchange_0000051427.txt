Q:

Roomba 560 "Could not connect to Roomba" Error in ROS (Ubuntu 12.04)

I've built an SCI-RS-232-USB cable for connecting to my Roomba using the following tutorial:
blog.makezine.com/2008/02/29/how-to-make-a-roomba-seri/

The cable works as I tested it on my Windows machine using the RealTerm Serial Terminal. I was able to make the roomba move and beep by sending raw opcodes. However it should be noted, I could only send packets if the RTS line was cleared, and only receive sensor packets if the RTS line was set.
I've tried to change the hardware and software control options in minicom to try to get a different response; no luck.  Basic troubleshooting - disconnecting, power cycling, etc.
Any help to remedy the problem is appreciated!
Here is the necessary info from the USB-Serial interface

A:

Try enabling hardware flow control. That should raise and lower the RTS pin for you from minicom.
Let me know your results, I'm working on the same problem and have so far had no luck connecting to the roomba...
