Q:

image_pipeline svn no longer exists on server

I'm trying to svn checkout image_pipeline using the link the ros wiki suggests, but the server is not responding.  I am using electric and need a svn source for image_pipeline. Can anyone tell me why image_pipeline is no longer on the svn server?

A:

It's been moved to github.  You can find the 1.6 branch at: https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/tree/image_pipeline-1.6 which is what was released into electric.

The source link on the wiki is now correct, but the image_pipeline/Releases page is broken.
