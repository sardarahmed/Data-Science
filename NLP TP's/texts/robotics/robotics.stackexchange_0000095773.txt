Q:

How to apply a namespace to the tf topic?

I'm trying to set up two instances of the same robot arm. Both are supposed to be controlled by their own MoveIt move_group. I quickly managed to run all relevant nodes within a namespace per arm. However, the topic /tf remains outside of both namespaces. I suspect that is the reason, why my move_group ends up controlling both arms at the same time.
I came across tf_prefix (http://wiki.ros.org/geometry/CoordinateFrameConventions) which sounds like it would do exactly what I need. However, I could not figure out how to use it. Setting it as a ros param didn't do anything. Is that a MoveIt related issue?
Below see the rqt_graph of my current situation. You can clearly see the box for /tf outside of the /arm1 namespace.

How can I resolve this?
Thanks!

I would run the rosrun tf view_frames command and look at the pdf to check how everything is hooked up in your transform tree.

Thanks Gancha9 the command rosrun tf view_frames helped me to understand the tf situation better. It turns out that tf_prefix actually worked the way I used it (see frames below). I suppose that solves the question I asked and my actual issue is caused by something else.
