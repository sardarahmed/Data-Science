Q:

Asscess point cloud from Velodyne VLP16

Hi,  I need the pointcloud from Velodyne VLP16. The author of velodyne drive  mentioned that "velodyne_pointcloud publishes its data using a custom PCL point definition: velodyne_pointcloud::PointXYZIR". Does that mean that is a topic? If so, after I did roslaunch "velodyne_pointclound VLP16_points.launch", nothing like that are in the topic list. Did I misunderstood something?

A:

I followed the suggestion for the author to run ring_colors_nodelet which publishes velodyne_rings. However, velodyne_rings is still pointCloud2 instead of msg that contains x,y and z information of the point cloud from the Velodyne sensor.
