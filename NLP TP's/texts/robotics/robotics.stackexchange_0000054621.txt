Q:

how to edit the ~/.bashrc file

The default editor for rosed is vim. To set the default editor to something else edit your ~/.bashrc file to include:
export EDITOR='emacs -nw'
But I don't know how to edit the  ~/.bashrc file.

A:

To edit it:

vi ~/.bashrc

and add that line. You could also use (as SaiHV answered)

gedit ~/.bashrc".

Make sure to

source ~/.bashrc

after editing it.
