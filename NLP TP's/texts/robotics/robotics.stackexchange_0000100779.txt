Q:

How do you use the differential_drive package

I looked at the ros documentation for the package but found the documentation was outdated, so I'm asking how do you use it in Noetic

A:

Hello @bribri123,

differential_drive

This package has reached its EOL as it provides support for only ROS Groovy and ROS Fuerte. If you are using ros noetic then you should consider packages like diff_drive_controller.
You can install this via:
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-diff-drive-controller
