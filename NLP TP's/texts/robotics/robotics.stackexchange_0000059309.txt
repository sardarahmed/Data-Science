Q:

Python and C++ nodes in the same package

I have a package containing some C++ nodes. How do I add a Python node using rosbuild?

A:

Just create your python node, then make the script executable and all should be fine. But also consider why you would want to do this in the first place.

Why not, having for example Python node for robot's hearing and automatic speech recognition and C++ node for vision and image processing, both in robot interaction package.

I'm also curious as to why you advise to consider doing this. Oftentimes a simple interpreted script that can be edited on the fly works much better than a compiled application, at least in the research environment.

So if you had already implemented C++ code from older lectures/projects, you would bother translate it to Python first for the sake of on the fly editing?
Comment by autonomy on 2014-05-22:
No, unless it was completely unmaintainable, I would not bother translating any existing code because it would be a duplication of effort. I don't think we're talking about duplicating existing C++ nodes in Python, but rather having them live side-by-side.
