Q:

Turtlebot+Object detector

Hi,
I want to add a object detector to the turtlebot. I was thinking of the roboearth software (http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth). The bad thing is that turtlebot is written for ros-diamondback and roboearth software for ros-electric.
My question is: Is it easy to change the software so it support other ros release? If it's possible which way is easier, change the turtlebot to electric or change the roboearth to the diamondback?
Thanks!
