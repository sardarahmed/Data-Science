Q:

Running a ROS node on VxWorks

We have a robot controller that runs VxWorks.  The controller supports the development of C++ applications.  To date, we have been able compile and execute a program on the robot controller that communicates with an external PC via socket connections(not sure of the type).  Can anybody give any insight into what would be required in order to run a ROS node on the robot controller.  I assume there would be some required libraries, but given our success with socket communications, I think there is promise.

A:

For basic ROS node capabilities you need to be able to open TCP sockets and communicate with XML-RPC.  Which if you have already achieved socket based communications extending it to run ROS should be possible.
