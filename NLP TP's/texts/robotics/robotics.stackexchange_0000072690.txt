Q:

Rosserial_xbee fails to connect xbees

My Xbee works fine with X-CTU in windows.
When I try to transfer data between XBee- end device with arduino to Xbee-coordinator connected to PC using
rosrun rosserial_xbee xbee_network.py /dev/ttyUSB0 1

I am getting following error :
Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

I followed the http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_xbee/Tutorials/Example%20Network tutorial which works fine for me the first time.
But now its not working.I didn't change any version after that.
I am using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.0.4
Sparkfun Xbee Kit series 1.
Can anyone please help me to solve this problem.

The device is actually connected to "  /dev/ttyUSB0 ". Even I verified earlier.
I am tyring to narrow down the problem to know who is the root cause.
Problem is not with xbee:bcz xbee can communicate in X-CTU using windows.
Xbee configuration doesn't have any problem.

Xbee end device RSSI is blinking means it can receive data from co-ordinator.
But CO-orninator RSSI never turns up. Means its not receiving sync from end device.SO what might be the problem in end device

Is it the problem in software serialnode.py or hardware? Hope there wont be problem in hardware connection bcz of same hardware tested in X-CTU.So what I can do in software

A:

Hi,
I checked with the device connection before itself as well as now with your command.
Still same problem.
I am able to check the rostopic.Which is published by Xbee as /diagnostics

Any Idea now??.. But what i think is co-ordinator able to communicate with End device with board.
The end device is not able to connect with master it seems. I dont know whats the problem.
