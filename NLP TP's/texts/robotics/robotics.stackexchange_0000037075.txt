Q:

ROS and nxt-python-2.x

Are there any plans, or is there work under way, to update the ROS NXT stack to use nxt-python-2.x? I would like to make use of the new sensor support in version 2.

A:

There are no active development efforts on the nxt stack.  Unfortunately nxtpython version 2 came out shortly after our stack was developed.  If someone would like to take up the charge and do so please contact me.
