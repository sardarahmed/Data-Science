Q:

Error in static_transform_publisher

Hi! I would a map with neato xv-11 and hector_slam in rviz. This is my launch file https://github.com/JanezCim/Neato-XV-11-Hector-SLAM/blob/master/neato.launch but when I type "$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher" I have this message "static_transform_publisher exited due to not having the right number of arguments". What is it? Thanks.

A:

You need to tell the static_transform_publisher which transform it should publish.
Check out the tf wiki page here.
