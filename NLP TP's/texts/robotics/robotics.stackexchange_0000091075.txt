Q:

How do I configure the XVLIDAR-ARDUINO MEGA?

When I run the line
rosrun xv_11_laser_driver neato_laser_publisher _port: = / dev / ttyUSB0

This message appears:
[ERROR] [1553391719.243142699]: Error instantiating laser object. Are you sure you have the correct port and baud rate? Error was open: Permission denied.

Please help me! :(

Are you sure that you have the correct port and baud rate? Also, do you have sufficient permissions?

Make sure the user is in the dialout group

A:

That error means you don't have access to the port but implies the port is present.
Try this at terminal prompt:
sudo chmod a=rwx /dev/ttyUSB0 

and try your node again to see if it works.
You can get more info on serial from the following(or at least 1,000,000 other links):
