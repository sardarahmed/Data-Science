Q:

How can Denavit-Hartenberg representation with only 4 variables describe rototranslations with 6 DOF?

I am wondering how the Denavit-Hartenberg representation is able to describe rototranslations with 6 DOF with only 4 parameters?
Some context:
Denavit-Hartenberg representations can be used to describe the rototranslation from frame 1 to frame 2. Frame 2 can be rotated as well as translated. Usually this involves 6 degrees of freedom (DOF).
I am pretty sure that's impossible and that I am missing something else.
EDIT (my current solution):
Systems that can be described using DHs only use joints with one joint variable. For example, a prismatic joint which can only move along one axis or a rotational joint which can only rotation around one axis. Then you lose 2 degrees of freedom => 6-2 = 4, thus 4 free variables are sufficient to describe the system.

A:

In general you need 6 parameters to describe the position and orientation of any  joint with respect to a link coordinate frame.  The DH parameterisation includes 2 constraints so only 4 parameters are required.  The constraints are:

axis $x_j$ intersects axis $z_{j-1}$
axis $x_j$ is perpendicular to axis $z_{j-1}$

(see Robotics, Vision & Control, second edition, p.197)
Personally I don't think it is useful to save 2 parameters given the confusion it creates for almost everybody, especially beginners, but I still find them confusing.  Saving 2 parameters is pointless given today's computing capability, but back in 1955 when this notation was invented it was perhaps more pertinent.
