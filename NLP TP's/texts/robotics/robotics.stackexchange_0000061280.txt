Q:

Problems creating own robot in Gazebo with catkin_ws

Hey,
I am still learning ROS and Gazebo. Right now I am using ROS-INDIGO and Gazebo 2.2. so I went through some tutorials at gazebosim.org especially at this one Using roslaunch and tried to follow all the steps.
Unfortunately I was not able to complete this one (and I see for the next tutorials an URDF model in a catkin workspace is required). So the problem is that so far I dint create my own robot in URDF yet and the Baxter robot which is suggested, if you didn't create your own robot so far, doesn't work (seems to be a more common problem as i read in another post).
So my question is now, can someone suggest a tutorials in which I can create my first (maybe simple) robot so i can keep on doing the following tutorials and complete this tutorial?
Thanks

Edit#1
First Terminal and roslaunch the world see here:

After in a new terminal, rosrun ing the baxter, see here and also see the error which occures:
schultza@Andreas:~/catkin_ws2/src$ rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file `rospack find baxter_description`/urdf/baxter.urdf -urdf -z 1 -model baxter
Traceback (most recent call last):

    from gazebo_ros import gazebo_interface

    from gazebo_msgs.msg import *
ImportError: No module named msg

After this Gazebogui doesnt react anymore and I have to kill gzserver.

Nothing new because of the error "No module named msg" ?
I faced this error already sometimes more

Hi!
You should download a urdf model, since it will be simpler to just spawn it in gazebo. If you want to create your own model you can follow the tutorial gazebo build model. It explains how to build a simple mobile robot.

Where is the difference to spawn it directly in Gazebo or via catkin workspace?
Comment by mateus03 on 2014-07-29:
If you just spawn the model in Gazebo you'll have the model in the simulator but you'll not be able to control it with ros. If you want to use the model in ros you should use roslaunch to spawn it, so the topics from odometry and the sensors are published.

I want to control it with Ros and i tried to download the baxter robot, but while spawning with roslaunch gazebo crashes instantly

Can you edit your question to show the error that you get?

Yep did it
