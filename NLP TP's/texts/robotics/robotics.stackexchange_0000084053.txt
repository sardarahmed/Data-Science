Q:

Unsupported package?

Hello everyone !
Begginer here
ROS INDIGO
I'm trying to install This package but I have some trouble :
I'm following the "read me" tutorial (replacing evidently ros-kinetic by ros-indigo) and everything's fine furthermore, i don't have error message when i catkin_make.
Then, i'm trying to source devel/setup.bash then
roslaunch rrt_exploration_tutorials single_simulated_house.launch

but there is this error message :
The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['articulation_tutorials'] [ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

i'm trying to find the package with rospack find, but it didn't seem to be registered. neither with rospack list.
is it due to the fact i'm using a new workspace for this tutorials ?
thanks by advance for you help (and sorry for the bad english !)
