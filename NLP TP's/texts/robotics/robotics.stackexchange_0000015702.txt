Q:

Turtlebot3 Burger - XBOX360 Controller

I am using ROS on the Turtlebot3 and try to teleop the robot with an XBOX 360 controller without success. I'm already able to teleop the robot via keyboard.
Setup:

Ubuntu 16.04
ROS Kinetic

What I've already tried:

Console 1: 
[Remote]-$ roscore

Console 2: 
[Remote]-$ rosrun joy joy_node

Console 3: 
[Remote]-$ roslaunch teleop_twist_joy teleop.launch 

Console 4: 
[Pi]-$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch

Console 5:
[Pi]-$ rostopic echo joy

I can already see, that the Raspberry receives the command messages from the controller.
But the robot doesn't move. Any ideas?

A:

It is now running. The problem was, that I didn't know, that I should hold the Windows Logo Button while using the joystick to move the bot. Alternativly you can push the joystick on the right down to activate the left joystick.
This works with the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One S controller :)
