Q:

NDI Polaris for orientation measurement

Hi All!
I would like to use the a ndi tracking system with ros and found the link: http://www.ros.org/news/2010/09/ndi-polaris-driver-in-kul-ros-pkg.html
Does anyone have used that before and can tell me in detail what do i need to install and how can i use the package/stack for measuring? I do face some problems while applying a rosmake.
So please let me know how I can save orientation data measured by the ndi hardware.
Thanks!

A:

It looks like the polaris driver was written to work with Orocos RTT 1.0 and no longer builds against the toolchain-2.5 branch or the fuerte rtt_ros_integration.
