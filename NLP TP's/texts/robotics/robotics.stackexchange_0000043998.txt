Q:

Irobot create Python script

Hola!
I am writing a python script, to run teleop_twist_keyboard.py for irobot create, by opening just one terminal in which I will call the python script.
This script should open roscore, then it will open a new terminal and run rosrun irobot_create_2_1 driver.py and finally open another terminal and it will run rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py.
So I want to write just one command in one konsole and then it will automatically open the new terminals and call for the 3 functions.

How can I open a konsole terminal from a python script?

A:

I'm not entirely sure that I understand your question, but this sounds like exactly the kind of thing that launch files are used for.  Using a launch file you could easily launch all of the nodes that you are interested in, automatically start a new roscore if one is needed, and control the inputs and outputs for each individual node (if for example you wanted each node to launch in a different terminal window).  All of this could be accomplished with a single call to roslaunch.  Here is a minimalist example that may do approximately what you want:
<launch>
  <!-- start first node and roscore if needed: -->
  <node pkg="teleop_twist_keyboard" name="keyboard_control" 
    type="teleop_twist_keyboard.py" output="screen"
    respawn="true" launch-prefix="xterm -rv -e" />
  <!-- start second node: -->
  <node pkg="irobot_create_2_1" name="irobot_driver"
    type="driver.py" output="screen" />
</launch>

Note that I have used the launch-prefix tag in the first node entry to force the node to open in a new xterm window.  More about launch files can be found here and available XML tags here
