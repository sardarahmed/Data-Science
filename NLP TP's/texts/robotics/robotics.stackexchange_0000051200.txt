Q:

Embedding a launch file with a parameter

I have two ros launch files, A.launch and B.launch.
I want B.launch to be included in A.launch like that:
A.launch:
<launch>
    <node name="rosbridge" pkg="rosbridge" type="rosbridge.py" />
    <include file="$(find some_package_name)/launch/B.launch">
    </include>
    ...
</launch>

Works pretty nice. However, it becomes a problem, as soon as there is a parameter necessary in B.launch:
B.launch:
<launch>
    <node name="$(arg START_NODE_NAME)" pkg="some_package_name" type="some_type">
    </node>
</launch>

I tried to use the following tag in A.launch:
<launch>
    <node name="rosbridge" pkg="rosbridge" type="rosbridge.py" />
    <include file="$(find some_package_name)/launch/B.launch">
            <arg name="START_NODE_NAME" value="goal_server" />-->
    </include>
    ...
</launch>

but that didn't work out either.
Is that scenario just not possible?

A:

You're on the right track. You only need to define the arg in B.launch, i.e. add
<arg name="START_NODE_NAME" />

to the top of B.launch.
