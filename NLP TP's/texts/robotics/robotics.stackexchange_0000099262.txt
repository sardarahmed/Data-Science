Q:

Best way to add package's models path to GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH in ROS2?

In ROS1, you could add your package's models path to the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH in package.xml (e.g. as shown here).
It doesn't seem like the same functionality (provided by gazebo_ros_paths_plugin.cpp) exists in ROS2. So is there a preferred alternative?
I know you can set environment variables using launch substitutions, but this would have to be done for each launch file.
Is there a way to set the environment variable at the package level (or at the workspace level, e.g. when sourcing your setup.bash)? Or would that be bad form?

A:

I see it in the ros2 branch: https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/blob/84a088be9bfcba4f8dda29eb52265c112dd808d2/gazebo_ros/scripts/gazebo_ros_paths.py and I do believe it is working.

One day I'll learn to look at the full directory, and to not just check if one particular file still exists... Thanks though - exactly what I was looking for.
