Q:

Running ros-diamondback-turtlebot (or anything, really) on the Eee 1215N

We bought an Asus 1215N Eee PC with the intention of rebuilding our Turtlebot on it. Bizarrely, I can't get the default build of Ubuntu 10.04 to work correctly; in particular, the Broadcom wireless NIC and the Atheros Fast Ethernet interface are not supported. Ubuntu (including the kernel) are now up to date with the software update.
After fighting with it, I used a USB stick and my Mac to download the common-wireless drivers. I can build for the Atheros and Broadcom devices, but I can only make one of them work at a time. Once I got FastE working with common-wireless, I tried to install the default Broadcom hardware drivers... that didn't work either. The driver is active but I am unable to connect to any wi-fi network.
Isn't the 1215N the exact machine that Willow Garage is distributing? If so, does anybody know if a) Asus changed the hardware; or b) there's a simple way to get both network interfaces working at the same time?

A:

We have updated the ISO to include support for the Asus 1215N-PU27 as well as the 1215N-PU17.  Give it a try with the new version.  mailing list post
