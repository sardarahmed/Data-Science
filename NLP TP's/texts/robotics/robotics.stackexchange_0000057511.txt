What do you mean by "merge"?

Are they already aligned correctly given the origins in the yaml?

What you can do is load the three maps using the map server. And then subscribe to the 3 of them and consider one as your reference-map. Then, compute the rotations necessary (to align obstacles for example) and then merge the 2 other maps with the reference. Of course you have to pay attention to the sizes and origins of the maps.

A:

MapStitch allows merging two previously non-aligned maps, provided they have sufficient overlap, are consistent and have similar appearance for the overlapping areas. We haven´t been using it a lot recently, but it worked in experiments we did a few months ago. You might also want to check out the "robocup" branch, as this contains potentially useful bugfixes. Unfortunately, I´m not able to look after it myself currently.
