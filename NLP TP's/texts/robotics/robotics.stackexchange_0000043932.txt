Q:

insufficient GL support

Hallo.
When i'm trying to launch gazebo empty_world this error appears:
Insufficient GL support
[gazebo-1] process has died [pid 13871, exit code -11].
log files: /home/listov/.ros/log/733761ce-f83a-11e1-9641-e83935533c12/gazebo-1*.log                                                               
all processes on machine have died, roslaunch will exit
shutting down processing monitor...

Also there is similar problem with rviz:

My configuration:
Video card: nVIDIA GeForce GT520
Driver: LINUX X64 (AMD64/EM64T) DISPLAY DRIVER version 304.43
OS: Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit
ROS: electric
I saw the similar problem with Fedora but i'm not sure it'll help me (i'm quite new with Linux).
So i'll appreciate any help. thanks.

No, i'm now trying to configure nvidia driver. I have these error when call glxgears:    couldn't get   an RGB, Double-buffered visual.

I'd suggest going over to this site for help until you can get glxgears working, then come back here if you still have problems with ROS stuff: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/

Everything is fine now, i've reinstalled this driver. When I was doing it first time, I  accidentally chose support of openGL 32 bit libraries.
