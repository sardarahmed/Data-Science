A:

This page gives general directions on how to download and install ROS on windows: http://wiki.ros.org/win_ros
As far as I'm aware, there is no single executable or installer that you can download and run.

Thank you for your answer, i have already been through that page so many times but i m still confused how to install it in my computer? is there any other easy way or steps to install ROS?

ros is not supported on windows.  I would recommend using a virtual machine, such as virtualbox, that runs ubuntu and install ros there.
