Q:

Calling nodelet manager service from console

Hey.
My question concerns how to use the nodelet manager service properly.
Consider a nodelet manager has been started and is running.
It's rosservice to load a nodelet (/manager/load_nodelet) is also available.
What do I have to call now to, let's say, start the openni_camera nodelet (openni_camera/driver) via this service.
rosservice call /manager/load_nodelet "/nodelet_name" "openni_camera/driver" [] [] [] "nodelet_name1"

tells my 'success' and /nodelet_name does appear under /manager/list topic for a couple of seconds, but vanishes after that with no debug message what so ever.
I am getting pretty frustrated over this, since the API has actually no documentation at all. (If you know different, PLEASE let me know about!)
Any suggestions?
Would be deeply appreciated.
Thanks.
Jasper

A:

I am going now with another approach and just wanted to close this question.
Now I am using app_manager to run the nodelet launch file remotely. This actually works quiet smooth and exactly as I need it.
Cheers!
