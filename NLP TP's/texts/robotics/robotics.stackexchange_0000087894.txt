A:

On Dockerhub, the new Ubuntu 18.04 LTS image is now the new Minimal Ubuntu 18.04 image. Launching a Docker  instance with docker run ubuntu:18.04  therefore launches a Docker instance with the latest Minimal Ubuntu. (Minimal Ubuntu, on public clouds and Docker Hub)

The ROS2 Bouncy docker images are already based on "Minimal Ubuntu". Refer to its Dockerfile FROM ubuntu:bionic (ubuntu:18.04 is equivalent to ubuntu:bionic). (ROS2 Ardent is not.)
