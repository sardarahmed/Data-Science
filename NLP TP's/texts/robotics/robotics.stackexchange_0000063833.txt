Q:

ROS-Industrial(Hydro) Training Exercises 3.6

Hi, all
I'm now following ROS-Industrial(Hydro) Training Exercises 3.6
I can finish the Exercise 3.6.1 which create a random motion for my robot.
Now when I try to do the next step, set a specific goal position, I had a problem.
I follow the instructions said:
"
copy the original example file to lesson_move_group_2,
modify the relevant sections,
and add the new lines to your CMakeLists.txt."
after the catkin_make and source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash everything works just fine. Like this:
However, when I do rosrun lesson_move_group lesson_move_group_2
there is an error :
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named lesson_move_group_2 below /home/viki/catkin_ws/src/lesson_move_group

which seems the lesson_move_group_2 doesn't build correctly.
Then I go to cakin_ws/devel/lib/lesson_move_group/  I found a file named "lesson_move_group_1" like a binary file. If I copy this lesson_move_group_1 file and rename it to lesson_move_group_2, then it can do rosrun lesson_move_group lesson_move_group_2. The robot will execute a random movement, just like runing the lesson_move_group_1.
So, I thought,  catkin_make and source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash didn't build the binary file for lesson_move_group_2.
Is my suggestion correct? and if it is then what should I do?
this is the link of the tutorial:  http://aeswiki.datasys.swri.edu/rositraining/Exercises/3.6

Please post the "new lines" you added to CMakeLists.txt.  It sounds like your file isn't building.  This could be the result of a bad CMakeLists or a compile problem.

I add these into the CMakeLists.txt
add_executable(lesson_move_group_2 src/lesson_move_group_2.cpp)
target_link_libraries(lesson_move_group_2 ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

A:

Included in the ROS-I training is the solution to every exercise.  You can search through the directories, or you can go directly there using training_ref 3.6 on the command line.  If you use the command line function, this will setup the workspace and build everything.  This should demonstrate the final solution to the exercise.
If you want to see what may be causing your specific issue, I recommend diffing the ref and work directories.
