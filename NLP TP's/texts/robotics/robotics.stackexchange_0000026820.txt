Q:

newbie-Example Plugins Location

Hi,
I am a Gazebo newbie. In the plugin tutorials, it is mentioned that the source code is available at  "gazebo_sources>/examples/plugins". Where do I find this? Is it supposed to be in my .gazebo folder? Or am I supposed to download it separately from somewhere?
Sorry for the basic question. I hope you can help me out.
Thanks

A:

They are in the gazebo src folders
if you just want to have look see here:
https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src
otherwise checkout the repo as described in the installation instructions...
