Q:

How to change Jenkins dev branch?

I changed the devel_branch field of my Indigo release (https://github.com/rospilot/rospilot-release/blob/master/tracks.yaml), as it was previously tracking master. However, the Jenkins job (http://build.ros.org/job/Idev__rospilot__ubuntu_trusty_amd64/51/) is still tracking master instead of my indigo branch. How do I update Jenkins to use the new configuration?

A:

The continuous integration uses the source definition from the rosdistro.
You should update the entry here: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/indigo/distribution.yaml#L10043
