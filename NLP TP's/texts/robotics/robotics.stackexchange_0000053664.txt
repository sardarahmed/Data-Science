Q:

Using Fuerte and Groovy in the same machine?

Hello, I know this question have been asked before here http://answers.ros.org/question/10660/what-happened-if-i-install-two-version-of-ros/ but, given it was almost 2 years ago, I just wanted to make sure if is still valid.
When installing ROS Fuerte and Groovy in the same machine will show any conflicts?
Other than source my setup.bash should I have to have something else in consideration?
Thanks.

A:

If you do not mix up the environment setup, this should work without any problems. It's also possible to start some nodes in a fuerte environment and others in a groovy environment and have them communicate. We actually did that in routinely for our entry in the Virtual Robotics challenge, starting the Gazebo based Atlas robot simulation in a fuerte environment and running all our software in a groovy environment.
