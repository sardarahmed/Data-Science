Q:

WARN : No transform between frames /map and scanmatcher_frame available

Hi everyone, I'm trying to map any unknown environment using HECTOR Slam with RPLidar alone. I run Hector Slam node in one terminal and also launched RPlidar node in another. But unable to get the map due to the following warning :
[WARN] [1459701587.170837560]: No transform between frames /map and scanmatcher_frame available after 20.001770 seconds of waiting.

I'm unable to figure out how to rectify the problem, as I'm new to ROS. Could anyone pls help me out.

A:

You are probably missing the (static) transformation between the /base_link frame and RPLidar's frame.

It worked. I'm able to get map, but distorted. I guess this might be due to not doing  pre processing on RPlidar raw scan data. Please correct me if I'm wrong and  Thank you very much for reply. Moreover If I move my RPlidar sometimes this error showup " searchDir angle change too large". Pls helpme

I think it'd be best to open a new question about this, Mohan. There, also post a screenshot of the "distorted" map; it will help with debugging. Finally, could you please mark my answer above as correct by clicking on the checkmark icon on the left? Thanks
