Q:

rqt_plot trajectory_msgs/Jointrajectory/points/velocities

Hey all,
I wonder if it is possible to plot this trajectory_msgs/Jointrajectory/points/velocities in rqt_plot?

I want to show the joint velocities[5], in this case -0.86621.
Thank you in advance.

A:

rqt_plot [YOUR_TOPIC]/points/velocities[5]

should work (obviously, adjust the topic name).
