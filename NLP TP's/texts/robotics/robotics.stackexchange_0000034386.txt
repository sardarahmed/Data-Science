Q:

Not seeing hand in rviz during kinect skeleton demo

I am trying to work with mit's kinect demos , everything is comiled and running - the prime sense viewer works brilliantly tracking person's skeleton but I am not able to visualize the hand point cloud data in the rviz - /hand0_point2 and all other topic are not working as I executed ' rostopic hz /hand0_point2 ' and the terminal shows only 'suscribed to /hand0_point2 and nothing shows up after that.

in the rviz i am not able to see my skeleton and no hand point cloud .
the status of the topics in the rviz shows warning with yellow glow at the status

A:

Rviz will usually give you a more specific error when you expand the yellow status. That will usually give you a clue as to what it has a problem with.
