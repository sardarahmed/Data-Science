Q:

Convert SDF world made with building editor to URDF

I'm using ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9.6.0.
I will use Gazebo's Build Editor to build a building using a floor plant image, like this:

You can see how it can be done in this video.
I'm going to use that world with ROS, but its format will be SDF, and I need a URDF file.
Do I need to convert it to URDF or I can use it in SDF format?

A:

ROS only works with urdf from what I've read and tried.
This python project should work for the conversion https://github.com/andreasBihlmaier/pysdf .
The usage looks like this sdf2urdf.py model.sdf model.urdf you can additionally add this before the model.sdf -p plotfile.png to export an image of model.sdf.
