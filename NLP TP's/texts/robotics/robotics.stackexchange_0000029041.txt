Q:

What version of Gazebo for ROS 2 foxy fitzroy on Ubuntu 20.04?

Hello,
I am a new user of ROS 2 and of course of Gazebo as well so there might be some concepts I do not have clear.
I have checked the Gazebo installation tutorials with ROS, but I do not see any mention about foxy fitzroy version. The latest one I see is Eloquent (with  Gazebo 9.x).
Is there any tutorial to install Gazebo with ROS2 foxy fitzroy?
Thank you in advance

A:

The official Gazebo version supported with Foxy is 11. This is defined on REP-2000.
If you already have Foxy installed, you can just install this additional package to get everything you need:
sudo apt install ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs
