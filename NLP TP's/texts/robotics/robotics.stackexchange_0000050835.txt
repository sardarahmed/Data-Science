Q:

catkin src/* vcs update

Hey everyone,
I'm probably missing something here...
Is there/What is the equivalent of rosbuild's rosws update for catkin
in the sense of updating all repository checkouts in the source folder simultaneously?

A:

Use wstool with catkin workspaces.
Use rosws with rosbuild workspaces.
The two types of workspaces and tools are completely orthogonal.
The equivalent to rosws update is wstool -t path/to/src update.

Ah, thank you for the quick answer.
Seems like I overlooked it here [http://ros.org/wiki/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying].
