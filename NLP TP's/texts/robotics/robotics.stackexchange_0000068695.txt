Q:

ROS Error: Cannot Launch Node of Type

Hi,
I am running Ubuntu 14.04. I've successfully installed ROS Indigo. There is this open source program called ORB-SLAM that I am trying to run but I getting an error.
Instructions I am following:

In Terminal 1:   roscore
In Terminal 2:   roslaunch ExampleGroovyHydro.launch
In Terminal 3:   rosbag play --pause Example/ Example.bag

Wait for Terminal 2 to finish loading the vocabulary file, then press “space” in terminal 3.
The error that I am getting:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ORB_SLAM/ORB_SLAM]: ORB_SLAM
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/ria/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

(Note: I am guessing this is coming from my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH)
What's inside the launch file:
<launch>
   <node pkg="image_view" type="image_view" name="image_view" respawn="false" output="log">
    <remap from="/image" to="/ORB_SLAM/Frame" />
    <param name="autosize" value="true"/>
   </node>
   <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz" args="-d $/home/ria/ORB_SLAM/Data/rviz.rviz" output="log">
   </node>
   <node pkg="ORB_SLAM" type="ORB_SLAM" name="ORB_SLAM"  args="Data/ORBvoc.yml Data/Settings.yaml" cwd="node" output="screen">
   </node>
</launch>

I am fairly new to ROS so I have a few questions:

I found a ROS link to install a catkin workspace. I've installed a workspace in the folder catkin_ws. This is a folder in my parent directory. It's not in my project folder. Am I supposed to have the workspace in my project folder?
(Note: I think I might have installed a workspace from the source instead of using the pre-existing one provided by ROS. That's because I didn't know how to use/run/install the pre-existing workspace. I would like to know how to do this.)

My catkin_ws folder doesn't have a package.xml and CMakeLists.txt in its folder. I found a CMakeLists.txt but that's in its src folder. I found both these files inside 'Beginner's tutorial' folder. Where are these supposed to be? Did I install the workspace incorrectly?

A:

I wasn't using a workspace properly. I was able to run the ORB_SLAM package by following these instructions by jwcrawley on github: https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM/issues/39

Greetings @riaverma96 ,
That was an annoying error I kept getting, but I think I've solved it now. I'll start from the beginning, which seems to have worked on 2 separate machines:
(Be aware, I only recommend the 1st step for completely clean install)

Use Synaptic and completely remove ALL ros packages

Follow steps on http://www.ros.org/install/ for Desktop-Full Install. I've used Jade.

Go into your ~/.bashrc and remove all instances of ROS (should be a source and an export line)

At the bottom of the ~/.bashrc, you want to put the following:
source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/catkin_ws:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Get ORB_SLAM into your ~/catkin_ws directory va git. After this is done, you'll have ~/catkin_ws/ORB_SLAM/{stuff}

Edit ORB_SLAM/manifest.xml and remove the whole line that mentions opencv2

Follow the compile directions appropriately for 3rd party and then main.

Add a node to the ExampleGroovyHydro.launch at the top (beneath the )
    <node name="usb_cam" pkg="usb_cam" type="usb_cam_node" output="screen" >
            <param name="video_device" value="/dev/video0" />
            <param name="image_width" value="640" />
            <param name="image_height" value="480" />
            <param name="pixel_format" value="mjpeg" />
            <param name="camera_frame_id" value="usb_cam" />
            <param name="io_method" value="mmap"/>
    </node>

9: Run roscore in a terminal.
10: Now use roslaunch to launch that file. It should spin up rviz and a webcam viewer.
Should be up and running.

Hi madeye, If i have to implement this ORB_SLAM in ARDRONE, which are the parameter do I have to change ??? there is launch file for ARDrone  like ardrone.launch. so which launch file should I run to get 3D visualization of the environment ?  should i use both launch files ??
