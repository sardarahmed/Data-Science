Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS on RTOS

Hi all,
Does ROS have/or will it have support for any RTOS? e.g QNX, Vxworks, LynxOS...
My requirement is not real-time processing. I am happy with normal ubuntu performance. However there occur situations where an existing project is already on say QNX. How do I compile ROS on such an OS. Any proven success on a specific OS? Any Existing blogs, posts etc. please share.
Cheers
Aswin

I think this is a very interesting discussion.
ROS at the moment neither is a realtime robotic framework nor has integration with any of these Real Time OS. AFAIK the only you can do is send strategical/non-realtime orders to a real-time system (ie: realtime microcontroller like arduino) and it would be the responsable to acomplish the real time goals. See: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial. Of course the realtime contstraints wouldn't be warranted until the rt-microcontroler has received the commands (since the rosserial communications are not realtime).
There are other robotic software frameworks like looks more prepared to work for real time systems like: YARP or OROCOS.
See this paper to know which operative systems they support.
However there are some packages that looks prepared to work for real time systems:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_mechanism?distro=groovy
It's not to much well explained how these mechanisms work in real time over a non-real time system like ubuntu-linux (Perhaps they don't run on ubuntu. The PR2 experts should know it)
