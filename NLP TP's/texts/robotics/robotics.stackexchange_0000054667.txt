Q:

SLAM 3D reconstruction with kinect

I'm trying to create a 3d reconstruction using Point Cloud Data from My Kinect. Since I'm fairly new to the whole concept of SLAM, I'd appreciated if you can direct me into some links and give me suggestions to how can I manage that.
Some specifications: Ubuntu 12.04 and Kinect for Windows
Thanks in advance.

I think you'll have a hard time getting the Kinect for Windows work with ROS/PCL, although it might be possible: http://pointclouds.org/news/2013/05/13/kinect-for-windows-with-pcl/ . The easiest solution is probably to just buy a regular Kinect for XBox or Asus Xtion.

A:

While 3D SLAM cannot yet be considered a solved problem, here are two ROS packages that are quite popular for that task using the Kinect: rgbdslam and ccny_rgbd

I'm using rgbdslam and installed the package following the steps provided in the "RGB-D SLAM for not ROS users" (the normal installation didn't work for me). Anyhow, what is the procedure I have to follow to compute a 3D reconstruction from my kinect once I installed the package? (silly question, maybe ... but ... I don't know a thing about this SLAM thing. And I don't have much time) ... Much thanks
