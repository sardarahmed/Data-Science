Q:

rviz over remote dns

I'm remote to my master_uri; ie http://somedns:11311
I can listen and publish to topics from the master, but I'm unable to list topics in Rviz or Gazebo. I can get it to work over my local network by exporting the local ip of the master to ROS_IP, but i cant resolve the dns server. any suggestions?
Thanks

A:

You probably don't have bidirectional communications. See http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup for some tips on making sure you do have bidirectional comms.

i read through all of the above documentation with no luck. I am outside my local network

What does no luck mean? Did you try the tests with ncat? did they succeed or fail?

nowhere in the above page does it say anything about nmap or ncat. I dont know how to run it across the dns server. Im trying to do some testing while at work another state over.

Ncat: Connection timed out. when i enter the master uri with or without the port.
Comment by William on 2017-03-07:
Sorry, I meant netcat. The likely issue is that you're cross a NAT and the ports are not open for the various ROS nodes to connect to one another. Most people use a VPN to avoid this issue of port forwarding with ROS.

tes netcat or nc is not communicating. on the robot I typed nc -l 1234 and on the workstation i typed nc somedns 1234 and I was unable to send a message to either computer. I even tried a few ports using -p. Could i have further complicated things by using virtualbox running ubuntu?

I can see the topics listed just cant gather any of the info explicitly.
