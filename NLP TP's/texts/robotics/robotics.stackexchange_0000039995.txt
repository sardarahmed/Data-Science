Q:

offline RGBD-SLAM can't generate transform

Hi,i'm new to ros ,i try to run rgbdslam offline from a bag,every thing seem to work fine,but the status bar show that the inliers always be 0.And the feature flow
image seem to do nothing.The node and edge could increase slowly.From the
terminal,i saw some output warning and repeat.
Could anyone help me out?

Inaddtionally,i can find some warn info in the log file:
such as

A:

I think the big warnings are something done by the icp library, shouldn't matter.
Also the other warnings shouldn't break things...
Have you tried another feature type?
