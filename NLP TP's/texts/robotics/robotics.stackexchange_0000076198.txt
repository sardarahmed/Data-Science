Q:

Can I install dual ROS version on the same machine?

I currently have ROS jade  running on Ubuntu 15.04. Now ROS Indigo has been released?
Can I install Indigo  alongside of jade and run both as needed?
Thank you.

I think you mean Kinetic. From older to newer: Indigo --> Jade --> Kinetic

If possible, I would go with Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) + ROS Indigo. If not, Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) + ROS Kinetic. I would avoid 15.04 + Jade as they are not long-term supported (LTS) distributions.

thanks a lot for your answer to me

A:

According to REP-3, Indigo is not being build for 15.04:

Indigo Igloo (May 2014)

Ubuntu Saucy (13.10)

Ubuntu Trusty (14.04 LTS)

(from here).

Can I install Indigo alongside of jade and run both as needed?

That would be possible, but not on Ubuntu 15.04, only one 14.04 (and Gazebo could be a problem).
On 15.04 you might be able to build everything from source, but that can be involved.
PS: Indigo is 'older' than Jade.

I know Indigo is 'older' than Jade. but i think distr jade of ROS not good for me because i'm elementary in ROS and don't have information about which one of distr is good with my research about this because some package not supported with jade.

Then I would suggest downgrading your Ubuntu installation to 14.04 (Ubuntu Trusty), and then installing Indigo.
