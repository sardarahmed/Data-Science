Q:

Installing standalone OpenCV?

Hi there,
I have groovy installed on my ubuntu 12.04. If i install standalone opencv without uninstalling opencv which is installed with groovy, would it be any problem?
Kindest regards
Hossain

A:

In this thread someone is having a trouble in using standlone library in non-ROS situation on Groovy (and it's not yet resolved on this forum).
I might be wrong (I'm in the middle of investigating how ROS installs OpenCV), but installing standalone version may not become an issue if you use OpenCV separately in ROS and non-ROS? As far as I've seen none of Groovy core packages that are related to OpenCV seem to depend on the standalone cv libraries.
