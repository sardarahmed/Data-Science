Q:

Cross-Compiling ROS fuerte for a Nao v4. roscore doesnt run

Hi,I am using ROS fuerte compiled form source, NAO v4 and cross compilation with NAO toolchain.
Currently this configuration is compiled and running only on the pc (ubuntu 12.05), but I have this error when I run roscore on the nao.
nao [0] ~/ros-nao/ros $ roscore
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/nao/ros-nao/ros/fuerte/bin/roscore", line 4, in 
import pkg_resources
ImportError: No module named pkg_resources
Any suggestion?? Thanks.

A:

You need python setuptools which contains the module pkg_resources.
