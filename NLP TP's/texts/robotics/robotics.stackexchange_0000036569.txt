Q:

opencv distance transform

I am not sure if this is the right place for an OpenCV question, but I will ask nonetheless :) I want to compute distance transform on a cv::Mat object. However, for each pixel in the matrix, along with its distance to the nearest zero pixel, I want to identify the nearest zero pixel (row/col) as well. Is there any in-built OpenCV functionality to achieve this? Thanks!

A:

I am not sure but I think that is called the "nearest feature transform" and AFAIK it is not implemented in OpenCV.
In any case you only want to find the nearest zero feature of a few of points you can find it integrating the trajectory which start in your "working point" following the gradient of the distance transform image. On a few steps bounded by the sqrt(width*height) you will find eventually the nearest zero feature.
