Q:

gzsdf: command not found with Gazebo 4.0.2 on Ubuntu 14.04

Hi
I'm running Gazebo 4.0.2 on Ubuntu 14.04.
I installed Gazebo with the one-line command given here.
I have a URDF file that I want to load in Gazebo. This file is given to me by somebody else and I don't have ROS installed. Following this tutorial, I want to use gzsdf to convert the URDF file to SDF.
However, when I try to run gzsdf, the command is not found. I also can't find the binary in my file system.
Where should it be located? What do I need to do to get it?
Thanks

A:

I found that the binary gz has a command sdf, which does what gzsdf is described to do.
So the command
gzsdf print MODEL.urdf

as given in the tutorial is now
gz sdf -p MODEL.urdf

Is this a recent change? This should probably be changed in the tutorial then?
