Q:

ROSARIA vs p2os for Pioneer LX

I am curious as to which of the two (ROSARIA or P2OS) would be more adequate for a pioneer LX mobile robot.
I am asking because although I would prefer to use p2os it does seem like an older package while the LX model is rather new.
As a side note, does anyone know if there is any package for auto-docking into charging station?

A:

You can use ROSARIA with the LX.  The LX has a few differences from other Pioneer robots that would need to be implemented in the P2OS node; if anyone wants to discuss those let me know.  (Mostly in how the robot computer, controller, and some components are interconnected, the basic protocol is the same.)
The full auto-docking process is implemented in the ARNL library (navigating to the docking station, then switching to a mode where it drives into the dock and remains at the dock until some condition (e.g. fully charged) or told to switch out of that mode.)  There is a ROS wrapper for ARNL you can run instead of the ROSARIA node if you want (ros-arnl, http://wiki.ros.org/ros-arnl).
Some of the tools used by ARNL to implement docking are available in ARIA however such as sensing the charging station, turning and moving into the station, etc.

Thanks for the quick response. I'm going to give the ARNL wrapper a chance as it does seem to provide what I'm looking for.

OK. There is still some work being done on ros-arnl to add features and find bugs, see the discussions on the issues section of the ros-arnl github repository.
