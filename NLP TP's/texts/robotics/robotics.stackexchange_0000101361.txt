Q:

Navigation with only Odometry( without Lidar )

Hi!
I want to compare the performance of Odom and Lidar. I managed to examine the accuracy of the lidar while the Turtelbot3 is not moving. Now I'm trying to investigate how accurate the odom is without interference from lidar, I'd be so grateful for any suggestions.

A:

Hi Belghiti. From what I understood, you want to use the Navigation Stack (probably move_base) based only on odometry. Considering that, the Navigation Stack requires a transformation from odom to map frame. Therefore, you need to publish a constant transformation between these two frames. You can write a node to do that, but I think that static_transform_publisher does exactly what you need. You can just set zero to all offset coordinates.
I hope this will help you.

You're welcome. In this case, you can even turn off your Lidar.
