Q:

ethzasl_mapping stack pointcloudmatcher

Hello
I am trying to make the extrinsic_calibration demo work
It is on the ethzasl_mapping stack.
I have followed the instructions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/extrinsic_calibration
and cannot compile all modules in the stack.
There seems to be a git repository problem with the pointcloudmatcher
Can anyone help?
Thanks
Miguel
