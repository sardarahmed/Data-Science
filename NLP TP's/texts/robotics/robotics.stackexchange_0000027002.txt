A:

There is a physics parameter called real_time_update_rate, which is the frequency at which physics time steps are advanced. The gazebo default is a time step of 0.001 ms and a real_time_update_rate of 1000, which multiplied together gives a real-time factor of 1. If you set the real_time_update_rate to 0, it will go as fast as it can. This can be done by modifying the world file (see worlds/friction_demo.world for an example). It can also be done from the gzclient gui, by selecting Physics and then real_time_update_rate.
