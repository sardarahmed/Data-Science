A:

Hi geek,
you can download the source of the mjpg-streamer. Look here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/develop
or here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mjpg-streamer/
download and make it. Then you can start the mjpg_streamer via shell so that it provides an apache server and a www directory, where it uploads the webcam pictures. Then you are able to include the created html or php file to your own website.
Maybe this helps you. I also use the mjpg_streamer and view the live stream with vlc or vlc plugin. Maybe this information helps you with your problem.
Best regards,
zumili
