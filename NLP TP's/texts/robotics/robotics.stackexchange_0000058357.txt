Q:

re_comm run issue

I have just installed RoboEarth but am having problems running re_comm as detailed here wiki.ros.org/roboearth_stack/Tutorials/Using%20recorded%20models%20for%20object%20detection
The output

rmb209@rmb209-Studio-1555:~/ros/stacks/knowrob$ rosrun re_comm run

rospack Error: stack/package re_comm not found

Could anyone suggest a reason or solution for this?
I have finished wiki.ros.org/roboearth_stack the installation instructions here, which seem to have built without any issues.
Thanks.

This is on fuerte

A:

The error message means that ROS cannot find the re_comm package. Please make sure that it is part of your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. If you used rosinstall or rosws for installation, don't forget to source the setup.bash again.

Following this I then had to re-follow the setting java path answer in a previous question
and set JAVA_HOME
Thank you for your assistance.
