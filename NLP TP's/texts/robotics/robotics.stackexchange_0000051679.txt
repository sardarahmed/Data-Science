A:

You can look at rosbridge for this.
Or write a node yourself that generates a html file with the level.

Excellent! Thank you for this information. I just checked it out. Does it run with ros electric, too?
also, Do you have any experience with Json? What the structure of such a file be, for example to get the data from rostopic echo battery?
