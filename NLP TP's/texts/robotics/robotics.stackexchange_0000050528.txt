Q:

Simple Navigation Problem

Hi,
I have integrated a Pioneer3AT mobile robot with ROS 2d navigation stack.
It's scan matches are completely correct all the time, but sometimes when i send it a navigation goal, it keeps rotating for a few seconds. specially when it is moving through a door. also the planned path for the robot is very near to the walls,
I know that there is a lots of parameters in navigation stack to solve this problems,
but i don't know which one is the right one!
Any body has experienced these kind of problems ?

A:

I have had some of these problems too.  I think inflation_radius and cost_scaling_factor control how "expensive" it is for the robot to go close to the walls and should keep the robot further away.  But I have had great luck with tuning them myself.
