Q:

Underwater navigation without the use of acoustic sensors

I have been reading about different types of underwater navigation.
According to this Youtube video, these are the following navigation systems:

Inertial navigation systems (use of Inertial Measurement Unit)
Acoustic (e.g., long-baseline)
Geophysical (use of external environment information)

This article states sonar affects whales and the use of the acoustic navigational systems should be minimized. It seems like the combination of inertial and geophysical underwater navigation is not enough. So what kind of underwater navigation system one should use in order to be environmentally friendly but also accurate?

A:

Usually, most underwater robots are running on just inertial navigation and surfacing occasionally. This tends to work better than one would expect and is what most large scale deployments end up using. Additionally, most of these use a Doppler Velocity Log, Pressure Sensor, and Compass in addition to their IMU.
Geophysical localization is fairly precise, SLAM solutions have been developed for mobile and underwater robotics for a long time. I believe underwater SLAM solutions are in a fairly mature place and if your robot is operating in a feature-rich environment and has the ability to use LIDAR or cameras you could get a fairly good localization solution.
As an aside, usually, the sonar on robots is much less powerful and less overused than shipboard sonar. It's probably not a huge issue unless you plan to explicitly work near whales (but I am not a marine biologist).
