Q:

cannot run ros commands

Hi! whenever i try to run ros commands such as roscore or rosmake, it keeps popping up >>
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/bin/roscore", line 34, in 
from ros import roslaunch
File "/opt/ros/electric/ros/core/roslib/src/ros/init.py", line 55
except roslib.packages.InvalidROSPkgException as e:
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
I would b glad if any of you can solve this problem.my default python version is 2.6.6. thanks in advance!

The syntax error would tend to indicate an older, not newer Python.

I just installed Python3.2 (Ubuntu 11.04), ran some ROS stuff with it, and I got an AttributeError exception. So while I agree with Lorenzo that this looks like some sort of Python version conflict, I am unable to reproduce the same error.

I think it's due to a Python 2.6 -3 conflict. Röhling maybe you should post your comment as an answer.

Are you sure that your ROS binaries actually use Python 2.6? The Syntax Error exception indicates otherwise. Do you have Python 3.x installed?
