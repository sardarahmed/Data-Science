Q:

Any robot developed using BANANA Pi as platform?

I know... the name does not inspire great confidence, but it is not my fault.
There really is a RPI-like (or BBB-like if you will) board that is called Banana Pi. In my opinion, its advantage, besides the Dual A7 processor, is the connection to a SATA device.
Can you imagine one of those with an SSD ?
Well, to the question: has anyone done ( or heard of) any ROS/robot development with one of those ?
