Q:

Tutorial pubsub is compiling but not running

Hi I am trying to run the pubsub tutorial using gradle.
The program compiles fine but when I try to run the listener program using the command;
$ ./build/install/rosjava_wiki_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_wiki_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker
it gives the following errors;
Loading node class: org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker
Exception in thread "main" org.ros.exception.RosRuntimeException: Unable to locate node: org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker
at org.ros.RosRun.main(RosRun.java:56)

Can you please help me in figuring out what is going on. I did a little digging and my CLASSPATH variable is appearing blank but I am not sure how I can set it.

I can't reproduce this issue. Make sure you've followed the instructions exactly. For instance, I see that you've renamed the directory. Depending on how you went about this, it could be part of your problem.

Hi Damon, actually just today I realized it might not be because of rosjava. I was trying to compile and run a different java program and it gave me a similar exception and failed to run. So I think that my CLASSPATH is not right. When I try echo $CLASSPATH, it is blank. Any idea on the right path?
Comment by damonkohler on 2013-02-21:
The class path will be set automatically by the scripts Gradle generates.

This is strange then because I was not using gradle for the other program I was trying to run but still that was giving the same exceptions.

A:

I C that its an year old, but probably its same as : http://answers.ros.org/question/34092/problem-running-rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/
So probably using this : ./rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/build/install/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_torial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker
should run this.
