Q:

Updating an outdated wiki page

The ROS wiki page on how to navigate the wiki is really outdated, especially the pictures. I found out the page was written when www.ros.org used to redirect to www.ros.org/wiki. I have made some changes to the page, but being relatively new to ROS, I want the opinion of experienced users so that I don't do more harm than good.
Also, is this the right place to ask this question?
Thanks

A:

I wouldn't worry about it too much. Whoever "owns" that page is getting email notifications about your edits, so they'll probably correct anything awful. They probably appreciate your effort and your perspective as a newcomer is really valuable for a tutorial like that.
