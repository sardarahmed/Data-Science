Q:

Source data types for navigation stack (PointCloud or PointCloud2?)

Hello!
I have been looking for information about the navigation stack and I am a bit confused. In the "Setup and Configuration of the Navigation Stack on a Robot" tutorial it is said:

"the "data_type" parameter should be
set to LaserScan or PointCloud
depending on which message the topic
uses"

while in the changelist 1.3 it is said:

"The navigation stack now supports the
sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 message which
should allow it to be used directly
with many PCL filters and nodelets. As
a result of this,
sensor_msgs/PointCloud support becomes
slightly less efficient because a
conversion must take place."

Also, I have found some people answering recent questions about data_types saying that they should be either LaserScan or PointCloud, even though the changelist is already a bit old (2010).
I have a velodyne sensor in V-REP that publishes in PointCloud2 so, I am wondering if I can directly add the sensor setting the data_type to PointCloud2 or if I really need to convert the point cloud.
I have tried it, but I get a few errors and I want to discard some options to get it to work.
Regards.

Yes, you can set the data_type to PointCloud2.
