Q:

Converting ros::Time to plain data structure

ros::time is derived from Time and Time class has 2 members uint32 sec, nsec. If I have ros::time, how do I store it into plain structure where i just have 2 uint32 fields. ros::time has toSec() and toNSec(), but neither of which returns uint32.
How do I convert ros::time to
Message time {
  uint32 sec, nsec;
}

A:

sec and nsec are public members of the ros::Time class:
  struct Time {
    uint32_t sec;
    uint32_t nsec;
  };

  Time t2;
  ros::Time t1;
  t2.sec = t1.sec;
  t2.nsec = t1.nsec;
