Q:

Help with catkin_make on an ARM

Hi,
I am trying to install ROS packages from source on Gumstix Overo. And I created the catkin work space following this tutorial. Everything works.
Then I used git to download bondcore package to /catkin_ws/src directory.
Then I run "catkin_make" in /catkin_ws. This is output:
root@linaro-alip:~/catkin_ws# catkin_make 
lBase path: /root/catkin_ws
Source space: /root/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /root/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /root/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /root/catkin_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "make -j1" in "/root/catkin_ws/build"
####

It seems catkin cannot find bondcore to build.
Then I try to build bondcore without catkin_make following this tutorial. However, I got error while running "cmake ../src"
root@linaro-alip:~/catkin_ws/build# cmake ../src

Anyone know why this happened? Thanks in advance!

A:

You are asking to build the joy target, which doesn't exist. See:
####
#### Running command: "make -j1 joy" in "/root/catkin_ws/build"
####
make: *** No rule to make target `joy'.  Stop.
Invoking "make" failed

In stead of calling catkin_make joy simply call catkin_make and it will build everything in your workspace.  In a new version of catkin_make (0.6.53+) there will be a --pkg option where you can specify individual packages from the workspace that you wish to build. See:
https://github.com/ros/catkin/pull/352

I tried both "catkin_make" and "catkin_make --pkg joy". Unfortunately, both of them didn't work. I updated the output.

catkin_make --pkg joy won't work until the next release of catkin...  What is in your /catkin/src directory? It looks like there was nothing to build.

I download bondcore package from https://github.com/ros/bond_core to /catkin_ws/src. But catkin_make cannot find it. So I try to build bondcore without catkin_make, I got some errors which I updated in my question.
