Q:

libuvc not setting image size correctly

I am trying use an HD web cam for tracking QR codes, but when I tell libuvc to output a 720X1280 image I get a 640X480 one. here is the launch file code for libuvc
<node pkg="libuvc_camera" type="camera_node" name="logitech_cam">
        <param name="vendor" type="string" value="0x046d"/>
        <param name="product" type="string" value="0x082d" />
        <param name="serial" type="string" value="D016F4DF" />
        <param name="image_width" type="int" value="1280"/>
        <param name="image_height" type="int" value="720"/>
        <param name="pixle_format" type="string" value="mjpeg"/>
        <param name="auto_focus" type="bool" value="True" />
</node>

does anyone why it is sending the wrong sized image?

A:

The parameters you want are width and height (no image_ prefix). I think you'll also need to set video_mode=uncompressed, as mjpeg isn't implemented yet (and there's no pixel_format parameter).
Auto focus isn't configurable (needs to be implemented in libuvc_camera and in libuvc), but it should be turned on by default in most cameras.
