Q:

move_arm and arm_controller conflict over action interface message type

I changed in move_arm.launch from
<param name="controller_action_name" type="string" value="arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory" />

to
<param name="controller_action_name" type="string" value="arm_controller/joint_trajectory_action" />

and hence my move_arm.launch is
<launch>
    <node pkg="move_arm" type="move_arm_simple_action" name="arm_tilt_laser_move_arm">
        <param name="group" type="string" value="arm" />
        <remap from="arm_ik" to="arm_tilt_laser_arm_kinematics/get_constraint_aware_ik" />
        <param name="controller_action_name" type="string" value="arm_controller/joint_trajectory_action" />
        <!--<param name="controller_action_name" type="string" value="arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory" />-->
    </node>
</launch>

because my arm_controller is looking for arm_controller/joint_trajectory_action/goal ;arm_controller/joint_trajectory_action/cancel ....etc
and got the following error:
[ERROR] [1320368664.906687128, 19.071000000]: Client [/arm_controller/arm_joint_trajectory_action_node] wants topic /arm_controller/joint_trajectory_action/goal to have datatype/md5sum [pr2_controllers_msgs/JointTrajectoryActionGoal/aee77e81e3afb8d91af4939d603609d8], but our version has [control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionGoal/8f3e00277a7b5b7c60e1ac5be35ddfa2].

Dropping connection.

I can understand from the error that move_arm being an action client (while interfacing to controller) is sending a goal message which is not of same type as arm_controller node action server listening to. same for feedback and result message type.
I am using electric.
Is it because of new arm_navigation stack that move_arm message types has been changed for interfacing with arm_controller??
Anyone got this problem before? Need help please.
Thanks,
