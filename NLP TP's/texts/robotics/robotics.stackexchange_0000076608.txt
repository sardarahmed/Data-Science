Q:

Cannot install gazebo_ros_pkgs

I unistalled with :
sudo apt-get remove ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros 

the gazebo_ros package and its relevant packages (in other words the whole gazebo_ros_pkgs was removed), but now when I type:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros

I get the following error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros

How is it possible ?

A:

I solved the issue by updating the apt-get command:
sudo apt-get update

I also followed again the steps provided by ros for the repository, but I don't think this actually solved the issue about the installation.
