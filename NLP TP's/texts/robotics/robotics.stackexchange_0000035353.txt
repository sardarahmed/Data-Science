Q:

OpenCV, drawing depth map

Hi! I have a little project on C++.
In this project, I I try to find sample image on depth map, received from Kinect. I check results by drawing both images (sample and current scene) in 1 window. Keypoints linked with lines after it. But I can't see current scene in window. Where can be problem? Something wrong  in src/Classifier.cpp, method void Detector::findObject(cv::Mat scene).
And one more question - what method should I use to copy data from one cv::Mat to other? I use cvtColor for this. I think, that class method copyTo() should do same work, but it doesn't. Thanks for help!

A:

I think, that found answer. OpenCV can't deal with different types images. When it tries to draw them in 1 window, only one image will be really shown (tested only with images from Kinect).
