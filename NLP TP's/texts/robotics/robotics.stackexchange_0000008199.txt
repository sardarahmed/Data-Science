Q:

Wires or columns which contract on passing electricity

Background: Introductory robotics competition for college freshmen; Bot has to open 8 jars (with two balls in each of them) in ten minutes and load the balls into a shooting mechanism.
So, we were doing this project and we hit upon a challenge that the jar is not opening like we originally intended to. So we decided to get a rack-pinion mechanism and use it for unscrewing the lid. However, it is too large and we are unable to fit the bot in the required dimensions
The actual question: Are there any wires or rigid columns/things which can contract ~1 cm when electricity is passed through it? And what would their price range be? Our budget is also in the list of constraints for the bot
Edit: We can include a wire of length <1m or a column of length <30 cm. Also, the wire needs to contract only more than 7mm

A:

It sounds like you are looking for an artificial muscle.
I see you've already looked at one type of

shape-memory alloy; also called memory metal, memory alloy, muscle wire, Nitinol

Have you looked at

twisted fishing line artificial muscles?
The other types mentioned in the Wikipedia: "artificial muscle" article?

It seems more natural to me to use normal rotary motors to rotate the screw-on lid of a typical jar, so I am curious to see how your system works.
Good luck!
