Q:

rclcpp::exceptions::RCLError

Hello,
does anybody know how to fix this error message?
Failed to find library 'rcl_interfaces__rosidl_typesupport_fastrtps_c'
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'rclcpp::exceptions::RCLError'
  what():  failed to initialize rcl node: type support not from this implementation, at /home/steve/ros2_ws/src/ros2/rmw_fastrtps/rmw_fastrtps_cpp/src/rmw_publisher.cpp:81, at /home/steve/ros2_ws/src/ros2/rcl/rcl/src/rcl/publisher.c:173

The exceptions is thrown at this line:
auto node = rclcpp::Node::make_shared("minimal_publisher");

Kind regards

is your library compiled ? mean do you have rcl_interfaces__rosidl_typesupport_fastrtps_c.so generated?

Hi, I have the same problem. The library is not compiled. How do I compile it ? I installed ROS2 from sources on Linux.

A:

This can happen if the library name for building the messages and the package name is different.  To quote Dirk here,

Atm the generated library for the interfaces must have the basename ${PROJECT_NAME}.
You have to options:
either rename your interface target to
just ${PROJECT_NAME}:

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME} "srv/MySrv.srv")
rosidl_target_interfaces(my_node ${PROJECT_NAME} "rosidl_typesupport_cpp")

or explicitly set the library name:

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}_srv "srv/MySrv.srv" LIBRARY_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
