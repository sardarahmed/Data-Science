Q:

Installing Arduino in Kinetic

I am trying to use Arduino with ROS and want to follow these tutorial. In particular, I am using this method to interface with Arduino. However, I am seeing this problem,
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinect-rosserial-arduino

Please, tell me what should I do and where I am making a mistake. I am using Arduino DUE. Thank you.

A:

ROS K is named Kinetic, so the proper installation command should be:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino
