Q:

How do I record multiple paths?

When I view bag files of recorded autonomous navigation, the global plan, and local plan seem to all get recorded under the same topic, even though they are published under three separate topics. This causes the plan to flash constantly between the three. How can I record these topic separately?
For example my topics are:
/move_base/DWAPlannerROS/global_plan
/move_base/DWAPlannerROS/local_plan
And when I play back the bag file, the only topic is:
/move_base/DWAPlannerROS/global_plan
But the points from the local plan are saved in that topic as well as the global plan points.

Could you post the command you're using to record your bags?

A:

There recently was a bug in rosbag that recorded topics from the same node into one. It sounds like you triggered that.

You should update ROS or more specifically ros_comm.
