Q:

ROS_STREAM relevant

While walking through the code of nav_transform.cpp (part of robot_localization), I got confused by several output stream, it goes like this:

ROS_WARN_STREAM(".........")
ROS_WARN_STREAM_ONCE(".........")
ROS_WARN_STREAM_THROTTLE(".........")
ROS_ERROR_STREAM(".........")
ROS_INFO_STREAM(".........")
ROS_DEBUG_STREAM(".........")
ROS_ERROR_STREAM_DELAYED_THROTTLE(.........")

What's the difference between them?
I do appreciate it if someone can enlighten it to me.
