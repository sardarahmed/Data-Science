Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

Did you solve this problem.? Ryt now i am facing the same

A:

I met this problem yesterday, when I upgraded OpenCV and some ROS dependencies were broken. What I did is to use aptitude instead of apt-get. It is more intelligent, and can give you some suggestions to resolve the problem. Probably, you have some low-level packages version mismatch, so apt-get refuse to install ROS.
Try
$ sudo apt-get install aptitude

$ sudo aptitude install ros-indigo-desktop

Then you will see the lowest unmet dependencies as well as the suggestions. Pressing n to refuse its first suggestion, cause the first suggestion usually does nothing, aptitude will give your more suggestions every time you refuse. Choose one suggestion you like.
Also, you may have to run $ sudo aptitude install ros-indigo-desktop and select one suggestion several times to solve the problem.
