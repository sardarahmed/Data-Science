Q:

enable carrot_planner

Hi folks,
How can I enable the carrot_planner in the navigation stack without have to write any code?
Is there a parameter to enable it (in the same way we can enable/disable dwa)?
Thanks
edit1:
After I include that line inside move_base launcher to include carror, now I get this error:
[FATAL] [1424988770.617038890]: Failed to create the carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner with base class type nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner does not exist. Declared types are  navfn/NavfnROS

what version of ROS are you using? do you have carrot_planner installed? eg.: roscd carrot_planner works?

I just installed it. I did not have it before. Thanks!

A:

you can add this line to your launch file, after your move_base node
<node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
    <param name="base_global_planner" value="carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner"/>
   .
   .
   .
</node>
