Q:

Using UWSim GPS

Hello,
I am a beginner user of UWSim and I was trying to use the GPS sensor. I run "rosrun uwsim uwsim" and the scene with the robot in a tank loads up. I notice that there is a topic "/g500/gps" and I call "rostopic echo /g500/gps". However, this does not give any data. I tried changing the rate in the XML file but this does not have any effect.
How can I use the GPS sensor?

A:

Make sure your robot is floating on the surface, GPS doesn't work underwater!
