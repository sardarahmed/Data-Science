Q:

gzclient source code location

I am trying to solve this issue where my simulation often crashes or is significantly slower when gzclient is not open.
To do that, I am first trying to figure out what changes once I open gzclient. Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding the gzclient source code in the gazebo repository, and would be grateful if someone could provide the link.

A:

Most of gzclient's code is under gazebo/gui:
https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/gui
This is gzclient's main:
https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/gazebo/gui/main.cc
Note that gzclient also uses gazebo::rendering, gazebo::transport, gazebo::common...
Good luck!
