A:

The repository seems to have launch files and is a C++ based node, so you'll need to compile it.
A bigger issue may be that it is not a catkin package, but is still rosbuild based.

How did you actually 'install it'? It is not enough to check it out, you'll need to build it.

Edit: a quick google search lead me to github.com/mars-uoit/rotoscan_node, which seems to be a catkinized version of the rotoscan_node package you linked. Cloning this into your src/ space and building using catkin_make should then work for you.

Edit2: also, isn't this a duplicate of Error about the rotoscan_node driver for the leuze laser scanner?

You need to build it using catkin_make, there is no other way. This is C++, you cannot execute it in any other way.

I actually  used the catkin_make into my catkin workspace , but it still like this error ,is there any other solutions ?

And after catkin_make, you remembered to do source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash?

of cause  i have , maybe , it is not a correct package ?

Please update your original question with the exact steps (on the command line) you took to create your workspace, download the package, configure and build it.
The catkinized version of the package I linked works fine for me here locally -- after compilation and source-ing.

It seems that  when i  installed the rotoscan node, it can be always output catkin_make error ,  if i delete , it will be ok

That is why I asked you to update your question with how you created your workspace.
You most likely forgot to install all dependencies. Do you have the timeutils package in your src space as well?
