Q:

How to run Rviz remotely

I assume that it's possible run run Rviz on a machine other than the one running the robot.  If so, how to I set the master address (the IP address of the robot) which Rviz should be subscribing to ?

You should only set one. ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME are optional environment variable that sets the declared network address of a ROS Node or tool. The options are mutually exclusive

Awesome.  Setting ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME on the remote computer fixed the problem.  I notice that setting the 2D Pose Estimate using Rviz no longer works though.
