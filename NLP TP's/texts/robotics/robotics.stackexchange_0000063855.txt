A:

It seems you do not have any C++ compilers installed. You must first install one to use catkin like this.
Try opening up a terminal and then typing:
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y 

Then the g++ compiler should be installed.

I already had it installed - this does not fix it. Any more suggestions?
