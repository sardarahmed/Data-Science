Q:

No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.9.so',

Rolling CI for RQt Image Overlay is failing on ROS Buildfarm with error message:
23:10:11 --- stderr: rqt_image_overlay
23:10:11 gmake[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.9.so', needed by 'librqt_image_overlay.so'.  Stop.
23:10:11 gmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:137: CMakeFiles/rqt_image_overlay.dir/all] Error 2
23:10:11 gmake: *** [Makefile:146: all] Error 2
23:10:11 ---

Ealier in the output of CMake, Python3.10 is found:
23:10:11 -- Found Python3: /usr/bin/python3.10 (found version "3.10.2") found components: Interpreter

Ubuntu Jammy is transitioning to Python3.10, so I don't quite know which package is forcing libpython3.9.so to be looked for.
EDIT:
It seems that many other packages are also failing the same error, many from ros2 core libraries too:

Rdev__rclc__ubuntu_jammy_amd64
Rdev__geometry2__ubuntu_jammy_amd64
Rdev__libstatistics_collector__ubuntu_jammy_amd64

A:

This issue has been resolved after ROS2 Rolling properly transitioned to Ubuntu Jammy .
