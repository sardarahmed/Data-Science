A:

Unfortunately MoinMoin doesn't have a built in concept for "comments" or "discussion" like MediaWiki. There are some plugins and the concept of "Supplementation Pages" in MoinMoin, but the ROS wiki does not use them. Which wiki page are you wanting to comment on? Usually if they are associated with a particular package you can just post an issue on that package's wiki or contact the maintainer directly depending on the comment.
