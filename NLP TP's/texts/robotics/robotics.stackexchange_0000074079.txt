Q:

Unable to Locate ROS Packages?

Ok so I am completely new to ROS, and I am having some trouble with the tutorial. I managed to install from-source, but now whenever I try to download the indigo tutorial package (sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-tutorials) I get the following error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-ros-tutorials
How do I fix this? I can't quite figure it out and all the other questions I looked at didn't give me helpful information.
Thanks!

A:

When you want to install ROS packages from the repositories, you have to add  them to your sources.list first, otherwise apt-get does not now where to find the packages.

Like BennyRe said: if not necessary do not install from source.

I had to install from source because " sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full " also did not work. This was the only way to even get any form of download going

So, are your repositories configured correctly?
If you run:
grep -h ^deb /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
The output should at least contain:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main
Otherwise apt-get can never find ros-indigo-desktop-full or ros-indigo-ros-tutorials
