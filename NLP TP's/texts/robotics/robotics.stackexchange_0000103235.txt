Q:

Where can I find an example of a C++ ROS 2 rqt plugin?

So far, I've only found ROS 2 rqt plugins ported over from ROS 1 that were written in Python. The docs (https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-RQt.html) mention writing custom plugins in both Python and C++, and I also see that rqt_gui_cpp exists on the rolling branch of the rqt github repos. I haven't been able to get a C++ rqt plugin build to work correctly without an example to work off of.

A:

One of the "core" rqt tools, rqt_image_view is mainly C++, then rolling-devel branch seems to be ROS2-tified (interestingly humble-devel branch, likely the branch for the latest released ROS2, still uses Catkin so not fully ROS2 yet).
UPDATE Apparently for some/many ROS2 releases, rqt_image_view has already been released (index.ros.org) so the branch may be of little concern even though some are still using Catkin as the build system at the time of writing). Try humble-devel? If you still see issues you should report at the repository.

Thanks, I believe this is just what I was looking for!

When running this plugin I get the following log messages:
munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
Everything I've found related to this refers to misuse of alloc functions which aren't used anywhere in the plugin codebase. Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong?

@Tupinambis I've updated my post.

After starting off from a fresh rolling container that error no longer occurs. I wish I could say what the root cause is, but oh well. Thanks again for your help.
