Q:

/tf from /base_link to /camera_link

Hi,
I'm using ccny_rgbd_tools which gives me a transform between /camera_link, which is the base_frame, and /odom, which is the fixed_frame.
I'm using MoveIt!, where I have a urdf model which as a camera_link and a base_link, which supposedly already gives a static_tf between them. I have a virtual_joint between camera_link and odom (which is floating, cause it is from a quadrotor).
Now running demo.launch (without the static_transform_publisher between camera_link and odom) I get this on the command line:
[ WARN] [1404846265.951041568]: No transform available between frame 'odom' and planning frame '/base_link' (Could not find a connection between 'base_link' and 'odom' because they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnected trees.)

I have a /tf between odom and camera_link, and a /tf from base_link to camera_link, which builds up a tree. Why does it needs a /tf between base_link and odom?
Thanks in advance!

can you try 'rosrun tf view_frames' and 'evince frames.pdf' and look or show the TF tree..this might give an idea of what exactly is happening down there.

Already did that! Odom doesn't even appear!

So is your ccny package running appropriately ? can you get the pose from 'rostopic echo \vo' and actually see the estimated pose in real time.

A:

ccny pkg is working properly. But now its working on Rviz also.
What I did was use robot_pose_ekf that receives the data from /vo and does the tf to base_footprint. Added a static_transform between the base_footprint and base_link and now I have the URDF position being updated in Rviz.
It kinda lags and sometimes has some jumps. Will probably have to add the IMU info also. Anyway, I would like to try the hector_localization package also to fuse other sensors, but I'm facing some difficulties due to to lack of documentation!
