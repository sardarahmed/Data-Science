Q:

Failure in reproducing the result from the paper "ICRA2010_Marder-Eppstein"

Hello,
I just started to use ROS. I am trying to reproduce the result from a paper following instructions in this link,
link: [http://www.ros.org/wiki/Papers/ICRA2010_Marder-Eppstein]
I got some errors when I was running this command:
rosmake icra_navigation_gazebo
I am using Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS Diamondback.
I've noticed that since the code from the paper was written in some older versions of Ubuntu(before 9.10), there were some dependency errors at first. I solved them by adding a few lines in rosdep.yaml files to specify the libs for Ubuntu10.04. But still, I got some errors.
The output in the terminal is shown here:
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['icra_navigation_gazebo']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory
[ rosmake ] /home/vincent/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20110311-202122

2, /point_cloud_mapping/build_output.log, shows no error.
3, /gazebo/build_output.log, shows no error.
Does anyone have similar experience or any idea about it? Any help will be highly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Vincent

Yeah, that solved the problem. I followed the suggestions in that post, added that line #include <boost/thread/condition.hpp> to several .h files according to the error prompt, and it was fixed.  Thanks a lot Paul~
