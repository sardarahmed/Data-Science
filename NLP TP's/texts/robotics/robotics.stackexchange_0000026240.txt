Q:

Model joints are giving error

Hello, I designed model in gazebo. I was working fine by this weekend but when I ran it today, it is giving strange error.
I am using Gazebo 1.6.3, ROS-Groovy and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

A:

We had recently made some changes the joint sdf syntax, but we decided to revert them since they would be too confusing. Try following the sdf 1.3 joint syntax, for example the double_pendulum_with_base model.

I m following that syntex. But strange thing was that before weekend it was working but when I updated my Gazebo this week its no more working. When i comment out joint part then links are working fine keeping model static.

Problem is solved I realized after updating my sdf file using gzsdf it changes from
   <child>finger2</child>

to

<link_name>finger2</link_name>

so i converted it back. Now things are better =)
