Q:

Cannot create package with opencv2 dependency using ROS Groovy

I am starting the Image_Transport tutorials and when I try to create a package with the stated dependencies I am getting the following error:
pedro@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws/src$ roscreate-pkg learning_image_transport image_transport opencv2 cv_bridge
ERROR: dependency [opencv2] cannot be found

How can I correct this error? I am using ROS Groovy running in Ubuntu 12.10. Any help is appreciated.

A:

You are trying to create a package that depends on opencv2 and it seems that you don't have opencv2 installed yet.
However, I would suggest you to create a catkin package, as you are using Groovy and you are inside a catkin workspace. This tutorial seems to have been last edited before Groovy was released, and that is why it is not creating a catkin package.
To make sure you have opencv2 installed, try:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-opencv2

Retry creating your package after that.
You can either follow the tutorial or create a catking package:
$ catkin_create_pkg learning_image_transport image_transport opencv2 cv_bridge

How do I install opencv2 when I have ROS Indigo? The ROS wiki says that "Since Indigo, OpenCV is not released from ROS infrastructure. Its ROS-interface package vision_opencv depends on standalone libopencv* packages".
