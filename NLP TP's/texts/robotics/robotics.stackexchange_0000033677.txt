Q:

Kinect with arm_navigation

Does anyone have any sample code for adding a kinect sensor to the arm_navigation code that is generated by the planning_environment wizard in Electric?  I had it working in diamondback but I am having problems getting the collision map to show up.

I forgot, you might also want to look at collider:

In fact, collider might do exactly what you're asking.
