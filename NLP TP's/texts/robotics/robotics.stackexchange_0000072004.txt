Q:

roslaunch. Passing parameters via command line

Hello all,
I am performing the tutorial Customizing the Stage Simulator and I am facing issues with the following command line:
roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch map_file:="~/stageTutorial/tutorial.yaml" world_file:="~/stageTutorial/tutorial.world"

When I execute it,  the following erros occurs:
[FATAL] [1455317172.700221865]: The world file ~/stageTutorial/tutorial.world does not exist.

and
[ERROR] [1455317069.732110275]: Map_server could not open ~/stageTutorial/tutorial.yaml.

Nevertheless, the directory stageTutorial and both files tutorial.world and tutorial.yaml exist.
This behavior becomes weirder because of the fact that when I export the path of both files to the turtlebot environment variables the launch file behaves as expected. The cited commands are:
export TURTLEBOT_STAGE_MAP_FILE=~/stageTutorial/tutorial.yaml
export TURTLEBOT_STAGE_WORLD_FILE=~/stageTutorial/tutorial.world
roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch

I do not have any clue about what is wrong and it is important to mention that the code was copied from a ros' tutorial without any change. So, here is my question: How can I run the fist roslaunch command correctly?
Thanks in advance.

What happens if you use explicit absolute paths?

A:

Three steps needed.
(1) change ~ to /home/useraccount
(2) change bitmap "../tutorial.png" to bitmap "/tutorial.png"  in tutorial.world
(3) copy turtlebot.inc to /home/useraccount/stageTutorial
Then it will work.

WANG Jiankun 's advice is useful. But I believe the bitmap "../tutorial.png" should be changed to bitmap "tutorial.png".
