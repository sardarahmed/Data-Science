Q:

imu stack tutorial non-functional

I have attempted to follow the directions in the imu_node tutorial and step 1.1 (compiling) appears to be broken.  I am running ROS electric on Ubuntu 10.10.
The following command:
rosdep install microstrain_3dmgx2_imu
returns the following error:
Warning: could not identify ['microstrain_3dmgx2_imu'] as a package
Any assistance is appreciated.

In ubuntu you can install it from apt: sudo apt-get install ros-electric-imu-drivers, then roscd microstrain_3dmgx2_imu, and you can omit rosdep and rosmake steps, as everything is already built. You should be able to rosrun the imu_node directly.
