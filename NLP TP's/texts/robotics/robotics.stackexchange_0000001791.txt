Q:

How to control a brushless motor?

I consider using a brushless outrunner motor, designed for helicopters, in my driving roboter. How can I control such a brushless motor with my micro controller? Of course I'll have a separate power source.
The roboter should be able to move forwards and backwards, so I need to control the motor in a way to determine direction of rotation, too. I think this isn't related to the question, but I need to ensure high acceleration.
Specially, I am talking about this motor which is listed in a German shop.

A:

You can control brushless motors 2 ways

control with a hall effect sensor http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-09152003-171904/unrestricted/T.pdf
sensorless(back emf) control http://www.pmdcorp.com/downloads/app_notes/BrushlessSensorConfig.pdf
or you can buy an esc (elcetronic speed control) My advice If you are not knowledgeable about electronic you can buy esc
