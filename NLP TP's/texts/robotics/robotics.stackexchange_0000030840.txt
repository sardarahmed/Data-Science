Q:

I cannot control a turtle spawned in another machine

Thank you. I can connect to roscore from machine #2. But, another problem.
I would like to control turtle (turtlesim example) in #1 using #2 keyboard.
So in #1,
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
And in #2,
$ rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
However, I couldn't control. And I also ran the 'rxgraph' util, it seems not connected.
What's the problem?
Here's my roswtf result.
I confirmed that, I can connect to machine #1 via 11311 port by using netcat utility

hyon-no2@hyon-no2-desktop:~$ roswtf

For the record, this is a follow-up question to this one: http://answers.ros.org/question/593/rosnode-list-does-not-show-the-roscore-in-other

A:

When you refer to a host by hostname (in your example, you seem to be using hyon-no1-desktop), you must have some way to resolve that hostname to an IP address (e.g., using DNS, Avahi or /etc/hosts).
When your refer to a host by IP address (like 10.0.1.25), you shouldn't have to enter that IP into /etc/hosts.
