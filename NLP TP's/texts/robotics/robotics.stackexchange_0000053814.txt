Q:

Ros_Controllers Package Catkin_Make Error

There seems to be an error when looking to catkin_make the Ros_Controllers package:
-- ==> add_subdirectory(ros_controllers/joint_state_controller)
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'joint_trajectory_controller'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(ros_controllers/joint_trajectory_controller)
CMake Error at ros_controllers/joint_trajectory_controller/CMakeLists.txt:116 (add_rostest_gtest):
  Unknown CMake command "add_rostest_gtest".

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

Checking github shows some recent changes linked with add_rostest_gtest, though I'm not sure if this is the reason for catkin_make failing?
Anyone else able to install the package

A:

The controller should be searching for the rostest dependency correctly (see here). Could it be that you have an older version of rostest installed?. The add_rostest_gtest function is relatively new. Could you check if your rostest installation contains this CMake function?.

This new function has not been released into Groovy yet, for some reason. So ros_controllers is failing to build, causing gazebo_ros_pkgs to fail building as well :/
The ros_comm repo is on version 1.9.48 but the corresponding Groovy debians is only on 1.9.47, which does not contain the add_rostest_gtest function.

The version of ros_controllers that uses add_rostest_gtest has been only released in Hydro. As Hydro diverges from Groovy these things will happen more and more (confessions of a Fuerte user ;-). I'd suggest that you overlay ros_comm with the Hydro equivalent, or if that doesn't work, with the Groovy version and add the extra CMake function manually.

I agree, but we have been telling lots of Gazebo users to install ros_control pkgs from source for Groovy and until now its been no problem. Ideally, the ros_controllers hydro branch should feature freeze and we begin development on a new indigo branch.

It should strive to not break the (C++, ROS) API within a ROS distro. It's possible to revert the change and use a more verbose cmake command combination, though.

I think if we just create a new release of ros_comm into Groovy the problem should be fixed.
