Q:

Fail installing modbus-tcp with rosdep

Hi everyone, my question is pretty simple.
I wanted to install the robotiq gripper packages, I have already git-clone them, but trying to catkin_make, it ends with this error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "socketcan_interface" with any of the following names:

    socketcan_interfaceConfig.cmake
    socketcan_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "socketcan_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "socketcan_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "socketcan_interface" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.

have anyone faced the same error? Â¿does anyone knows what should I do?
Thank you all for your time.

A:

Please see #q252478 for instructions on how to build things from sources. Just git clone-ing is not enough.
