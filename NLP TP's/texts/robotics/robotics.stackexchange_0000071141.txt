Q:

Using gmapping to build map and transport to the Non-ROS PC

Hello ROS users,
Is it possible to use gmapping to build the map and transport the map to the Non-ROS computer?
To specify my question: I have a sick TiM 561 lidar(2D lidar) and I can launch it from the ROS package in the ubuntu 14.04LTS ROS
computer. Because I need to build the map to let my vehicle knows where is it and then do some vehicle dynamic suck as
obstacle avoidance and parking. Therefore,  I want to use the gmapping to build the maps and I want to transport the map
to the Non-ROS computer. But is it really possible to transport the map which is built by the gmapping to the Non-ROS
computer?  Does someone know? Could you give me some directions or suggestions. Thanks in advanced.

A:

You could use the map_saver in http://wiki.ros.org/map_server to convert the map into an image that can easily be copied to your non-ROS PC.

Because the lidar transmits the distance data to my ROS computer. Can the map_saver collect all the data  of lidar and convert into the X,Y coordinate if the map? Thank you.

No it cannot. As it is clearly explained in the linked page...

@NEngelhard, I saw it and I think I need to change the title because I need to transport the map which is just 0 or 1 signal or x,y location of the object and then feed that to the Non-ROS computer which is the controller let a robot know can really know the environment. But thanks anyway really.
