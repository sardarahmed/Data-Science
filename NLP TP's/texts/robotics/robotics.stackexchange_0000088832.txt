Q:

IMU: What is the "w" in the IMU data

Hello there,
i use the Gazebo IMU-Plugin to generate sensor data of an IMU for my robot.
An IMU message looks like the following:
header: ...
orientation:
x: -9.881865455454e-324
y: -9.881865455454e-324
z: 8.8755655245457e-17
w: 1.0
orientation_covariance ...

I understand the x,y,z koordinates, but what does that "w" mean?
Thanks for your help.

A:

It's the fourth component of a quaternion. (You don't have to fully understand the math behind it, it's roughly a rotation axis and a corresponding rotation angle around this axis). See also: tf2/quaternions

Just as a clarification: @vonunwerth: the entire orientation field is a Quaternion.
