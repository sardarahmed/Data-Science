Q:

Problem of trigonometry

Hello,
I have a big problem of trigonometry, I want to convert the yaw of my robot from quaternion to radians using GetYaw() function, it's working pretty well, but I still have a problem.
I am using cos and sin functions but
the robot orientation is now in radians but it's going from -pi to +pi, why wont it be like any normal trigonometric circle, from 0 to 2pi ?
Here there a way to change that ? Im pretty stuck at the moment and my brain is smelting, thank you in advance !

A:

Gazebo uses a right-handed coordinate system. Most models are created with the x axis pointing out the front, and +z pointing up. Yaw behaves as one would expect from trigonometry. Looking from above the yaw angle increase when the model rotates counter-clockwise, and decreases when the model rotates clockwise.
