Q:

Lidar in simulation

Hi. Let's say that I want to add a Lidar sensor (eg. Velodyne 3D) on a robot_description, in simulation. What plugin should I use? My guess is I should use a laser plugin (eg. Libgazebo_ros_laser.so), is that right?
In addition, what is the normal usage of Lidar's data? By this I mean do I use the laserscan directly as input to other nodes like gmapping? Or do I need to first convert laserscan to pointcloud2 or other forms like odom?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I would suggest looking at the file urdf/gazebo.urdf.xacro in turtlebot_description.  The section beginning
xacro:macro name="turtlebot_sim_laser"
contains a description that creates a lidar sensor on the robot.  Gmapping expects laser scans and odometry as input, so the output of this sensor should work directly.
