Q:

Fail to rosmake

weiyang@ubuntu:~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/robot_setup_tf$ rosmake
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

It was my previously backup package before I reinstall my ubuntu which referring to the tf tutorial. Why am I not able to rosmake it right now? It suppose to be working like other package that I paste into current workspace.

How is the workspace set up?

A:

The package is not in your package path probably.
Try
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:`pwd`

and rosmake again.

You should execute the command in the package that you are trying to build and then do rosmake after that.
Check that the package is indeed in your package path by typing echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

One best way is paste this command into your .bashrc file. It certainly helps.
