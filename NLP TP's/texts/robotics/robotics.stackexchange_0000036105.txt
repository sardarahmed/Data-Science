Q:

How to get meaningful backtraces in ROS?

Hello all,
I have a question and I would be grateful if you could find time to answer.
I have a segmentation fault using Linux + ROS + C, and I want to analyse it.
What I do is the next:

ulimit -c unlimited

compiling + running

gdb my_executable core

bt

But I receive "??" instead of functions names.
In order to do solve it, I have uncommented the next line in CmakeLiskts.txt file:
set(ROS_BUILD_TYPE RelWithDebInfo).
And I also have tried to use: set(ROS_BUILD_TYPE Debug)
I still have problems...
Your help will be more than appreciated.
Felix.

Thank you for your answers, the problem (as always) obvious: wrong executable name.
Still, it is very nice to know, that help can be found here :).
