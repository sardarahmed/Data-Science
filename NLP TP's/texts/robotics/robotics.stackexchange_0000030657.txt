Q:

Multiple or Conditional Configuration Parameters

Hello,
First of all, I must say that I'm not sure how to organize/design this.
So, I'm going to explain it with an example:
I have an application that detects features using OpenCV features detectors. I've allowed to dynamically reconfigure the feature detector (one of: SURF, SIFT, GFTT, ...), coding a cfg file as explained here.
Now I want to do the same for the parameters of each feature detectors, but I'm not sure what can I do with ROS support.

Could I make the parameters of each feature detector to appear (in reconfiguregui) conditionally, depending on the current feature detector selected?

If not, is it possible (appropiate) to have serveral cfg files in a single package? I think, this way I could run several instances of reconfiguregui, one for a feature detector.

A:

Dynamic reconfigure currently does not support hiding parameters based on other settings. That would be wonderful to have. There is an enhancement ticket requesting it.

It is possible for a package to contain several cfg files. And, it must also be possible to access them somehow from within a single node, since nodelets can do that. I don't know exactly how to do it, but would suggest experimenting with defining each callback in a separate subordinate namespace.

Each callback in a separate subordinate namespace works, even with a single-threaded spinner. Thanks!
