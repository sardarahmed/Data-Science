Q:

3D SLAM & Velodyne HDL-32E

Does anyone know if there's a good 3D SLAM package out there? We have a Velodyne HDL-32E. Thanks to @joq and others, the ROS driver works like a charm. But we haven't found a 3D SLAM package to use it for. Thanks!

@xylo, could you share the results of your search for a 3D SLAM solution?

A:

I know that the ethz_icp_mapper stack has a pipeline that works with the Velodyne.
You can find more information on the nodes here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ethzasl_icp_mapper
If you look a bit deeper into the packages, there are some preconfigured launch files for Velodyne, I think that it would be a good place to start: https://github.com/ethz-asl/ethzasl_icp_mapping/tree/master/ethzasl_icp_mapper/launch/artor

Thanks for the pointer. Unfortunately it doesn't do loop closure, which is essential for reducing the estimate error.

ethzasl_icp_mapper needs an odometry source right? http://wiki.ros.org/ethzasl_icp_mapper says that sensor frame â†’ /odom is a required tf Transform.

can I install ethz_icp_mapper in indigo?
Comment by joq on 2016-04-29:
I don't see any Indigo release of that package. You can try building it from source.
