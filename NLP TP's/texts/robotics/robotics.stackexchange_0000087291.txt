Q:

[docker] ament: command not found

I tried to use the ros2 docker image and could not find the ament executable. What am I doing wrong?
$ docker run --rm -it osrf/ros2:ardent-basic bash
# echo $PATH
/opt/ros/ardent/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
# which ament
# echo $?
1
# ament build
bash: ament: command not found
# find / -name ament
# echo $0
bash
# source /opt/ros/ardent/setup.bash
# # same results with the commands above. No sense in repeating

A:

You are doing nothing wrong, the developper tools are not installed in the docker images only the libraries and demo executables (similar to the ROS1 docker images).
If you want to compile code I recommend you to install ros-ardent-ament* that will install ament_tools (providing the ament executable) as well as various ament packages providing utilities for testing.
If you plan on developing ROS2 code, I recommend you to also install all the building dependencies (build-essential, setuptools etc) that are listed in the Install GCC, G++ CMake, Python 3 EmPy package [...] section of the installation page.
Hope this helps

You can also checkout the current ros2 dockerfile that builds ros2 from source and concisely installs core build dependencies:
