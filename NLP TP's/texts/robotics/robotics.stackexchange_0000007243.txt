Q:

Fast C++ library for stereo vision/disparity computation

I am looking for a library for disparity map / stereo vision computation. These are my requirements:

C++
Multi-platform (Linux, Windows, OSX)
(preferrable but not mandatory) not CUDA based
Suited for robotics (e.g. it should work even if the images are not perfectly rectified and the cameras are not perfectly calibrated)
Suitable for tracking purposes (20fps or more)
Performing even with low-res images (e.g. 320x240px)
Open Source

A:

I'll try to answer this question on my own, but feel free to add more information on that.
We tried OpenCV's standard disparity function, but it fell short mainly because of item #4. Further, it is very slow (running at 1fps with images at 640x480px even on powerful machines). 
Recently, we are doing some tests with libelas and it seems promising. It is more robust, faster and it generally works better.
