Q:

gps sensor in gazebo 1.9

I'm trying to attach a gps sensor to a gazebo model of a robot I have.
I use a robot.urdf.xacro file to describe the robot and a robot.gazebo file to describe the sensors.
I don't know how to implement the gps. Is there any tutorial or information about it?
Thanks

I am trying to use it but I don't know how to implement it in the .gazebo file.

A:

You can include it in the URDF model of your robot using the plugin tag like this:
<gazebo>
  <plugin name="novatel_gps_sim" filename="libhector_gazebo_ros_gps.so">
    <alwaysOn>1</alwaysOn>
    <updateRate>10.0</updateRate>
    <bodyName>base_footprint</bodyName>
    <topicName>fix</topicName>
    <velocityTopicName>fix_velocity</velocityTopicName>
    <drift>5.0 5.0 5.0</drift>
    <gaussianNoise>0.1 0.1 0.1</gaussianNoise>
    <velocityDrift>0 0 0</velocityDrift>
    <velocityGaussianNoise>0.1 0.1 0.1</velocityGaussianNoise>
  </plugin>
</gazebo>

Here you can find a working example.
