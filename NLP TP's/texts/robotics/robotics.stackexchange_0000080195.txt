Q:

How do pause code while waiting on feedback from sound_play?

I have a little voice-recognition project going for myself where the system communicates through a listening node and a speaking node. The problem is that I can't figure out how to "pause" my code and wait for my speaking node to call on .say() in sound_play and finish speaking before my code can continue. Because as it is right it calls the .say() method and says what it's supposed to but the code just keeps on running ( listening ) while it's still saying it and I don't want that.
Any ideas?

A:

I've never used it, but from looking at the source, you can tell it to block:

Each say/play/start/repeat method can
take in an optional
blocking=True|False argument that
will over-ride the class-wide
behavior. See soundclient_example.py
for an example of this behavior.

Hi, my code is written in C/C++ and I'm not really sure how I could use this blocking function. Passing blocking=true to sound_play::SoundClient.say() doesn't seem to do the trick, it gives me a compile error that basically says I shouldn't pass that argument.
