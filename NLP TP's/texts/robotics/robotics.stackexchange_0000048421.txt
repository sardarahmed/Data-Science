Q:

Is Pose View in rqt buggy or not finished?

In rqt when I run a rviz and the add a "Pose View" the Pose View seems not to work properly and when I kill it the rviz does not work anymore so that I have to restart rqt.
Is this well known? It seems to me that a lot of the plugins malfunctions so maybe it is just a matter of time before they are finished. Or is this unknown so I should try to report every bug I find?

Although I don't see exactly the same behaviour, I see combining rqt_rviz & rqt_pose_view seems faulty. I opened a ticket http://goo.gl/LUCDY

Meanwhile can you tell us the version you're using by like dpkg -p ros-groovy-rqt-rviz, dpkg -p ros-groovy-rviz, dpkg -p ros-groovy-rqt-pose-view?

Added the version information to the question.

A:

Easiest workaround came up after the discussion among the original developers; run rqt_gui in multi process mode by:
$ rqt_gui -m

This will work around any other issues that arise from running OpenGL in a single process.
