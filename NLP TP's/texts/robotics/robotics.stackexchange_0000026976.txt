Q:

Ground truth map for a gazebo world like the willowgarage model

Hi all,
I use the turtlebot in the willowgarage world to create a semantic mapping system. As the actual mapping (using gmapping for example) is not the most important part of this effort, I would like to be able to use ground truths for the start as well. I found a way to get the ground truth pose (using the topic /gazebo/model_states), but now I also want a way to get the ground truth map, or at least some way to construct such a map. Is that possible?
Alternatively, is there a way to provide gmapping with the ground truth pose such that it just builds perfect maps (assuming a static world)?
Ultimately I would like to have a tf frame /mobile_base_groudntruth and a map topic /map_groundtruth.
Any help is very much appreciated!
Best,
Koen

A:

You can also use this tutorial to generate a 2d image of the Willow Garage floorplan.

I build a tool for ROS that can generate maps, based on your link. It can be found here for anybody who is interested:
https://github.com/koenlek/ros_semantic_turtle
Package: st_gazebo_perfect_map_generator

The repo above no longer contains this package - it was last seen in this commit: https://github.com/koenlek/ros_lemtomap/tree/154c782cf8feb9112bc928e33a59728ca2192489/st_gazebo_perfect_map_generator

The link in the post is also now dead, and should be http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=custom_messages

I also need a ground truth for my map, is this generator package still somewhere available?

All links are now dead - both in answer and in comments...
Must admit that the answers experience of Gazebo is very bad...

There's a bug in Askbot which adds some garbage to the end of the link, you should be able to copy it and paste on your browser. All the links are working for me like this.

Thanks! Works well with copy&paste.

Recreated the package (Kinetic) in case someone needs it: https://github.com/hyfan1116/pgm_map_creator

Does it work only on Gazebo 9, since it throws an error on Gazebo 7 while doing catkin_make?
