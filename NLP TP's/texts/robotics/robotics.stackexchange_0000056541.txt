Q:

How to get the line "source devel/setup.bash" to run after every time you catkin_make?

I have "source devel/setup.bash" added to my bashrc file, but sometimes, if I create a new package and then compile it for the first time with "catkin_make", then I find I need to open a new terminal in order to run the package because the terminal I already have open needs to source devel/setup.bash again.
Does anyone know how to get "source devel/setup.bash" to run every time I do catkin_make?  Or otherwise how to solve this problem?

A:

Either you must run the above source command each time you open a new terminal window

or add it to your .bashrc file as follows.

echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
I found the above instruction from this website:

or
catkin_make  &  source devel/setup.sh

or even set up an alias for that e.g. in your ~/.bashrc
alias catkin_make_and_source='catkin_make & source devel/setup.sh'
