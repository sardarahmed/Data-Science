Q:

Simulation environment for conducting visual servoing experiment

I want to conduct the following experiment:
I want to set up a scene with a kuka lwr4+ arm, a 3D model of an object and a camera overlooking them. I want to find the pose of the object using some pose estimation algorithm and move the arm towards the object. 
In general I want a piece of software or a combination of cooperating software that can do all that without having to reinvent the wheel. Is there anything available?

A:

You could consider taking a look at Gazebo Robotic Simulation and the Robot Operating System. Both might require a bunch of work getting used to, but I am sure it is worth the effort.
