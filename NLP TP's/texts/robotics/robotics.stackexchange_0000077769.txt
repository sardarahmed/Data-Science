Q:

How do I parse rostopics from a ros bag in C++?

I want to write a  node that would parse a ros topic given as the input argument and display the message published by it.
Can you please give me leads to point to existing examples that I could look into?

I'm not sure I understand you completely, but perhaps the topic_tools::ShapeShifter can be of help.

A:

If I understand your question, you want to read a rosbag and display the messages from a particular topic? If that's the case; the Rosbag Cookbook contains a C++ example on how to do so.
The C++ API is also helpful and contains another example on how to read from a rosbag in C++.
