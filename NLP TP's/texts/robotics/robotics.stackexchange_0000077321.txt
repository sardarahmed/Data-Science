Q:

build_depend for eigen3, kinetic in package.xml

Hello
I am using eigen3 in my node. So I added the following statement to my CMakeLists.txt
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
include_directories(${Eigen_INCLUDE_DIRS})

but what should I add to the package.xml, eigen3 or eigen?
<build_depend>eigen</build_depend>

or
<build_depend>eigen3</build_depend>

Greetings

A:

Looking at ros/rosdistro/rosdep/base.yaml, the eigen key maps to Eigen 3 (here), eigen2 maps to Eigen 2 (here) and the eigen3 mapping (here) is a bit ambiguous and incomplete (perhaps @tfoote can explain that one).
If you don't need v2, you should just depend on eigen, otherwise on eigen2.
Note btw that (at least in Indigo and Jade) in addition to build_depending on eigen, you should also add a build_depend on cmake_modules to be able to use find_package(Eigen3 ..), as that package provides the find script for it.

Thanks that way the answer I was looking for.

The eigen3 target looks to be a sweeping gentoo fixup followed by a sweeping fedora fedora fixup. gentoo fedora
Comment by tfoote on 2016-11-14:
They should be merged into the eigen target and eigen3 removed since that's the one used for all the other platforms. https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/13200
