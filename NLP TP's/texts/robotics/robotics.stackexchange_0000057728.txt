Q:

Dynamic reconfigure GUI improvements

Hi all,
I'm currently working on a camera driver and I was wondering if any of the ideas I list here are even possible:

Group some dynamic_reconfigure parameters into groups or "boxes" so that the end user can see that those parameters are related. Ex: Acquisition params, Trigger params, White balance params...
Add tooltips or a info box whose content changes when the mouse hovers a particular parameter in the dynamic reconfigure gui.

And I've seen in the tutorials that it's possible to have more than one config file in one ROS package. If the package contains more than one node, then the relationship is easy: one cfg file for each, but could it be possible to have more than one cfg file in the same node? Therefore, could I "group" the parameters I want in different cfg files and show them as a tree in the dynamic reconfigure gui?
I tried groups (even with prosilica_camera example) in dynamic_reconfigure but whenever I open the GUI to see the params, reconfigure_gui crashes:

the tooltip / info box idea seems useful enough. Maybe you could open an issue on github for future reference.

Done. https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/216

A:

The rqt_reconfigure GUI currently does not work very well with groups and there is an open ticket about it: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/162

Thanks Dirk, that's clearly the reason. I'll close the question.
