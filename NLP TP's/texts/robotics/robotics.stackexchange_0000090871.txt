Q:

Manually localise in RTAB-Map

Is there some way to manually localize on RTAB-Map?
At the moment, when we launch RTAB-Map in localization mode, we need to drive the rover account for a bit until it finds enough visual points to localize.
Is there some way to manually localize on the map so we don't have to wait (an undetermined amount of time) for the rover to figure out where it is on the map?

Hi,
yes it is possible to drop a "guess" with RVIZ using the "2D Pose Estimate" button like in this video at 0:50. Make sure to remap the topic initialpose of rtabmap node and that the Fixed Frame in global options is map. Example (if rtabmap is started in rtabmap namespace):

cheers,
Mathieu
