Q:

Does rosjava_core harm the normal ros install?

Hi,
Based on the documentation and questions on rosjava, I am not certain whether installing rosjava replaces the normal ROS install or is just another library.  Could someone clear this up for me please?  I want to talk to an android device using ROS, but still need all of the normal ROS stacks.  How does this work?
Thank you.

A:

You are going to create an overlay for rosjava. So there will be a different set of setup files that you will source to switch between workspaces. So, your packages should be fine given that you properly install rosjava. Try sticking to the document.
