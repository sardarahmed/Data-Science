Q:

host key verification failed

I upgraded the Turtlebot laptop to Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Fuerte. After that, I tried to ssh from my workstation. It gave this error:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST
IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING
SOMETHING NASTY! Someone could be
eavesdropping on you right now
(man-in-the-middle attack)! It is also
possible that a host key has just been
changed. The fingerprint for the RSA
key sent by the remote host is
ca:e6:7b:30:7f:bf:5a:ca:fe:....
Please contact your system
administrator. Add correct host key in
/home/davidchik/.ssh/known_hosts to
get rid of this message. Offending RSA
key in
/home/davidchik/.ssh/known_hosts:1
remove with: ssh-keygen -f
"/home/davidchik/.ssh/known_hosts" -R
172.17... RSA host key for 172.17... has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.

How to reset this key?
Thank you very much.

A:

Use ssh-keygen -R <hostname you want to delete>
Not ROS specific although.
