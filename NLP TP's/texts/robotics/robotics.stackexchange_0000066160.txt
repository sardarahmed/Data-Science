Q:

Gazebo and Real world Contact Sensors

Hi,
I want to simulate a Service robot which features bumpers and also I want to build a real one.
Now the question is, what topics to use?
The Bumper plugin for Gazebo outputs a lot of information on the contact, but I only want to know if it is pressed or not. Also when it is in the Gazebo package, I guess it should be used  for simulation only, right?
What topic shall I use for real sensors?
Bool?
And how to interface Gazebo?
Do I have to write my own node to get the pressed state from the topic?
Or is there somehing ready to use?
How do I interface this to already available ROS planing systems?
Is there a common way to do this?
Or do I have to add Obstacles to the costmap myself somehow, when a bumper is being pressed?
Thanks!

A:

I don't believe there are proper standards for this.
A good example might be the turtlbot's base, i.e. Kobuki.
There is a bumper message and to get it into move_base, these are converted to point clouds:
