Q:

AnyMsg equivalent in C++

Hi,
Is there any C++ alternative to rospy.AnyMsg? I need to forward a message in binary format so that I would like my node to subscribe to an unserialized version of the message, or something similar. The only solution I found so far is to create a custom adaptation as explained here in point 3.3, but this requires to customize the traits for every message type.
Thanks!

search the wiki for something called shapeshifter

I saw it but for any reason I do not remember I thought it was not what I wanted.

A:

The relay node in the topic_tools package uses ShapeShifter to forward messages without knowing their type: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/indigo-devel/tools/topic_tools/src/relay.cpp
