Q:

Sotp publishing tf /odom from Gazebo

Hi,
I've asked a related question when I needed to put gmapping, laser_scan_matcher and stageros working together.
The problem was that but stageros and laser_scan_matcher publish the odom->base_footprint.
I solved the problem by going to the stageros.cpp and stop the publish of the transform.
But know I want to make a more evolved simulation including IMU and Cameras and wanted to try Gazebo, but the same problem occurs and I cannot find where modified Gazebo to stop publishing.
Has anyone had the same problem???
Thanks in advance
P.S. I think will look in the Pr2 simulation perhaps there they have a similiar problem

The quickest way to do this is to remap the topic to an unused one.
