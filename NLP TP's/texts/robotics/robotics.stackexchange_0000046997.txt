Q:

dynamic_reconfigure and catkin

Dear all,
I would like to know if there is a way, even a workaround, of generating dynamic_reconfigure files from a catkin package. AFAIK, there is no way currently to use dynamic_reconfigure in a catkin package as the CMake macro is not compatible (rely on rosbuild macros).

Is there a workaround?
Is it planned for dynamic_reconfigure to switch to catkin?

Thanks!

A:

I believe there is a way do generate the files using catkin:
In your CMakeLists.txt

#add dynamic reconfigure api
find_package(catkin REQUIRED dynamic_reconfigure)
generate_dynamic_reconfigure_options(relative_path_to_file1 relative_path_to_file2 ...)

From the dynamic reconfigure tutorial: http://ros.org/wiki/dynamic_reconfigure/Tutorials/HowToWriteYourFirstCfgFile
