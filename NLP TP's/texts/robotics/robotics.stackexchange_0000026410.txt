Q:

Laser scanner implementation

Hey everyone,
I wanted to know how to add and implement a laser scanner / laser scanner plugin to my robot. The data of the scanner shall be passed to rviz by using ROS messages.
I got a Gazebo standalone installation with ROS installed afterwards.
My robot so far consists of a moveable base which I can move around through ROS cmd_vel messages. The control is implemented via a gazebo model plugin.
As a first step I added a sensor to my sdf file with the data of our real laser scanner. But now I need the logic for an appropriate gazebo plugin (no point cloud).
Thanks
Christoph

Hi! Can you make that a real question please. Because the text limit in comments is quiet low and the answer maybe interest other people too. Thanks.

Hi,
what I did is: I installed the whole drcsim package and linked directly to the libgazebo_ros_laser.so. That may not be the best solution, but for the time being that will work for me.
Thanks for your help.
