did you solve it?

Had the same problem, and no, re-compiling PCL with C++11 and catkin_make again with new PCL didn't solve it.

Has anyone managed to solve this problem at the end? I tried following this but without success.

A:

Download the newest version of RGBDSLAM from https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2  for indigo.
Now it works well.
