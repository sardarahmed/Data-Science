Q:

Tutorial adding sensor to robot. Error/Bug?

In this tutorial when I insert my_robot I get a grey screen from Gazebo, and in the console it says "Waiting for model database update to complete".
Then says "Unable to connect to model database...".After this starts giving errors. Is there anyway I can simply download the model of the Hokuyo sensor? Why is this even connecting to some database? There is something really wrong with this tutorial.

A:

You can clone the gazebo_model database, and copy it into ~/.gazebo/models using:
cd ~
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models
cp -r gazebo_models/* ~/.gazebo/models

The error message "Unable to connect to model database" means that either you don't have an internet connection, or the gazebo web server is down.
