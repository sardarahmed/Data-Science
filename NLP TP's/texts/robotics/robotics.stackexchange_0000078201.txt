Q:

how to generate urdf.rviz file

I am curious about how to generate the urdf.rviz file, since I have seen a lot of tutorials using urdf.rviz file when loading urdf to rviz.
It just happened but they did not explain how we can derive a urdf.rviz file by our own, without which we can not use below code in launch file:
<node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="-d $(find urdf_tutorial)/urdf.rviz" required="true" />

Instead, I have to  rosrun a rviz instance and add a robotmodel mannually

A:

urdf.rviz is just an configuration file that is not generated automatically. The easiest way to generate these files is to open RVIZ, add some panels and save the resulting configuration. It's only about personal preferences so that there isn't really a way to generate or derive .rviz files.

Thanks for your answer, it helps.
I thought the rviz config file is related to the urdf file, so I wanted to find a way to generate it and use it in launch file.
Now I know it really does not matter but a config for rviz .
Thanks again!
