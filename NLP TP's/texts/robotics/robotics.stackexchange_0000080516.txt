Q:

Baxter simulation with controllers doesn't work

Hello there,
I haven't been able to run the Baxter simulation with controllers by following the instructions in Baxter simulation installation page (here). The only point at which I deviate from the instructions is that I did the installation from the kinetic-devel branch instead of the master branch to support ROS Kinetic as per the suggestions in here. I use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with ROS Kinetic. After I was done with the installation and the configuration of the Baxter.sh to include my baxter hostname and my ip, I run the following command:
./baxter.sh sim

followed by the following command to run the simulator with controllers:
roslaunch baxter_gazebo baxter_world.launch

Then I Get a long output trace, the notable of which are the following segments:
<initialization output omitted>

Please let me know if more information is needed.

A:

Did you follow the ROS Kinetic tabs for the Prerequisites and Baxter Simulator Installation sections? The default tab is Indigo, which will not work in your case.

@imcmahon Thanks for your help so far. When I followed the instructions for Kinetic, I was able to download all per-requisite packages except for ros-kinetic-driver-common. I get the error E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-driver-common. Any hint on what's the problem here please?
