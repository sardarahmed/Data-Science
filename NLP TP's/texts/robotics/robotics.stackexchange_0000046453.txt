Q:

roslib.message.get_message_class python node error

Hi,
I want to know the class of message giving message type via following one code line. I run this python node on(Fuerte/Ubuntu 12.04) and get following error while the same code does not give any error when I run it on (electric Ubuntu 10.04).
error:
msg_class = roslib.message.get_message_class(self.topic_type)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'message'

Do I need to update roslib?
Thanks

A:

You need to have the following import:
import roslib.message

(not just import roslib).
