Can you provide a link to the hardware and I assume you are planning to use Linux?

A:

It has only a 200mhz processor and 32MB Ram..You can run Linux on it and ROS perhaps. But it will be really slow and you need to set it up yourself. I would recommend you buy a Beagleboard or a Raspberry Pi. Those already have a small community with people that use it with ROS. The Raspberry Pi is also very cheap (but harder to source).
