Q:

ssh rviz: cannot connect to X server

hi, I am using indigo in ubuntu14.04.2. I am trying to connect my desktop computer(zyq.local) and another computer(thinker.local). I can ping them from each one, and I have set the hostname and host_master_uri like this:
in my desktop computer:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=zyq.local
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://thinker.local:11311

in another:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=thinker.local

then I login the robot computer through ssh
ssh thinker.local -l think
roscore &
roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_pi_robot.launch

after this I open another terminal in my desktop computer an connect robot computer again
ssh thinker.local -l think
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find rbx1_nav`/sim.rviz

now error occurs:rviz: cannot connect to X server 
I do not why, two computers can ping each other. Thanks.

A:

By default a ssh connection does not allow any graphical interface to be displayed.  To allow this you have to add the -X argument to the connection.
It should be something like
ssh -X thinker.local -l think

Then you will be able to open any GUI.
Regards,

thanks, it works.I have another question.When I control the robot through desktop computer without ssh like thiszyq@zyq:~$ rosrun rviz rviz -d rospack find rbx1_nav/sim.rviz, it told me [rospack] Error: package 'rbx1_nav' not found. But I have set the HOSTNAME and URI, what should I do thanks

This is because probably you don't have the rbx1_nav package on your desktop computer. Maybe just run rviz rosrun rviz rviz and then add the displays manually

no, I don't have this package. But I have it in my robot computer, I want to add the displays manually on my desktop computer while don't use ssh. Can this be achieved? If not, I don't know what is the HOST_MASTER_URI used for(I have set it http://thinker.local:11311). Thanks very much.

Yes, you can manually add the displays in your desktop computer. The ROS_MASTER_URI variable is used to tell ROS that the roscore is running on your robot computer, and therefore being able to read the topics on that computer.
