Q:

Can't import rospy

Hello,
I have a ROS aplication in Python and Qt, and when I run it from the terminal all is ok, but I try to run with double click (the script with the permissions and Nautilus configuration appropriate) and the aplication can't import rospy.
I use ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04.
Any idea? thanks!

rospy is not on the default PYTHONPATH, and so without sourcing the appropriate /opt/ros/$distro/setup.* script won't be resolvable for Python. It's probable that by 'double clicking', the environment is not properly setup, leading to the problems you describe.

That happened, I could discovered it with you advice, thank you!

A:

As gvdhoorn sais, the environment wasn't setup.

I have put the ros variable enviroment in a new file ~/.myenvironmentvariables and I load it from ~/.bashrc (for Terminal) and from the file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/40x11-common_xsessionrc from Files Browser. Just with the code source ~/.myenvironmentvariables. And finally rospy can be import with double click in nautilus.
