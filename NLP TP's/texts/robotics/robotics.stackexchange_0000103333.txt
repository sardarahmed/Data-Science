Q:

Read rosbag in python at timestamp

Hello,
I use python and and want to read rosbag data at the data timestamp.
Is there a routine to do that or should I generate delay after each read corresponding to the duration to the next timestamp ?

A:

If you are asking how to publish messages stored in a rosbag file in "real time" using the rosbag API, then yes, your code must insert an appropriate delay between read calls.
