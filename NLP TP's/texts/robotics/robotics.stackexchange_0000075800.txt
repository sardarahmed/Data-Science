I don't think footprint layer exists any more, obstacle layer takes care of it?  Is this from https://github.com/youbot/youbot-ros-pkg ?   It looks like it hasn't been updated in years.

HI,Zeeshan and lucasw,
I have the same problem when I [Creating a New Layer],(http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d/Tutorials/Creating%20a%20New%20Layer) I got the ERROR:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'pluginlib::LibraryLoadException'
  what():  According to the loaded plugin descriptions the classsimple_layer_namespace::SimpleLayer with base class type costmap_2d::Layer does not exist. Declared types are blablabla ...

Can you help me, Any opinion is look acceptable.
Thank you in advance
UPDATE
I have already solved the problem, the cause of error is my format error in costmap_plugins.xml.

It would probably be nice if you could include what was that "format error", so that future readers can try to avoid it.
