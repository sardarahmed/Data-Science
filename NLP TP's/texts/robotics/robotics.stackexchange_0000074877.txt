Q:

Error while using pointgrey camera

HI,
I am using pointgrey camera. I have installed the pointgrey camera driver successfully. When I launch the camera node, I can see the following topics : /camera/camera_info , /camera/image_raw and /camera/image. But when I try to subscribe to camera/image topic, I am getting the following error.
[ERROR] [1467135193.921150993]: Client [/Camera_Object_Detection] wants topic /camera/image to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/Image/060021388200f6f0f447d0fcd9c64743], but our version has [wfov_camera_msgs/WFOVImage/807d0db423ab5e1561cfeba09a10bc88]. Dropping connection.
Can I know how to fix this ?
Thanks.

A:

The problem is a message type mismatch. The subscriber node is looking for sensor_msgs/Image messages but the publishing node is sending out wfov_camera_msgs/WFOVImage messages. I've never heard of the second one so I assume it is a custom message for the publishing node. You'll either have to change the publisher/subscriber so that the message type is the same in both or see if there is some way to convert it.
[EDIT] After looking at wfov_camera_msgs/WFOVImage on github, the message contains a standard sensor_msgs/Image with some extra info. It should be simple enough to change the subscriber node to use the WFOVImage message and just extract the regular sensor_msgs/Image.
