Q:

Best toolchain for recording kinect data and converting to pointcloud offline?

I'd like to save raw kinect data with minimal computer overhead to achieve maximal framerate on a computer that may not have enough performance for much else, and then take the saved data and do the depth-rgb alignment and conversion to point cloud non-real-time.
What tools and commands should I use?

A:

I've found some discussion of the same question here: http://kinect-with-ros.976505.n3.nabble.com/Ros-kinect-Point-cloud-projection-in-a-second-pass-for-CPU-limited-systems-td2497149.html#a2756101
When I get a chance to try it out I'd like to produce a tutorial with every command line documented, unless someone else beats me to it.
