Q:

Is there a Gazebo plugin that simulates sonar and infrared sensors?

We are adding sonar and IR sensors to a robot. It makes sense to include them in the Gazebo simulation.
In ROS, those devices use the sensor_msgs/Range message.
I have not yet found any existing plugin for those kinds of devices. It does not seem terribly difficult to write one, but I want to avoid working on a problem that might already have been solved.

A:

We are using the GazeboRosRange class available in the pal_gazebo_plugins repo. If you find it useful, we could maybe consider moving it upstream.

Thanks! I'll give that a try, probably within the next week or so, and let you know how well it works with our segbots. Surely, there are enough potential users to justify inclusion in some standard gazebo sensor package.

Thanks, seems like a good addition.  I've created an issue https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/162

"If you find it useful, we could maybe consider moving it upstream." We do. Will follow up on the github issue.

It is now in the process of moving upstream.
