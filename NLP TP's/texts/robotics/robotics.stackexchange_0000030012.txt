Q:

sharing code on Answers.ros.org

When people correspond on this site and they want to share code back and forth as well as with the greater audience following a topic or conversation that interests them, is there a common location or way to share the code?
Thanks, -Scott

A:

Small snippits can be inlined.
Larger snippits or whole files can be posted on places like pastebin
If you want to share a larger chunk of code I would suggest hosting it properly in a version control system which is public.  There are many such as googlecode sourceforge github and bitbucket to name a few ones with free service.
Update:
Google Code is no longer active

I would second Tully's suggestion to use a shared version control system.  I've been using GoogleCode's svn system but only as a single user so I don't know how well it works with multiple authors.  The process seems to be that one person sets up a repository and then sends a password to others giving them permission to check stuff back in.  (Checking out is public.)  I see others are using git or mercurial so there may be better reasons to go that way.  But for example, Scott could set up a GoogleCode repository called something like "facedetect-ros-pkg" and we can start plugging away at some code.
