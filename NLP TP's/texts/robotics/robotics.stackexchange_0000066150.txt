Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: roslint error

I am trying to perform an extrinsic calibration based on the following tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/industrial_extrinsic_cal/Tutorials/Camera%20to%20Target
I have installed all the dependencies outlines and when I try catkin_make before carrying out the steps outlined in the tutorial I get the following errors:
...catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package roslint.

  Set roslint_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for
  roslint.  The file will have one of the following names:

    roslintConfig.cmake
    roslint-config.cmake

And
...CMakeLists.txt:206 (roslint_cpp):
  Unknown CMake command "roslint_cpp".

Anybody ever have the same problem or could help in fixing it?
Thanks

A:

I have installed all the dependencies outline(d) [..]

The error simply states that you don't have roslint installed.
Could you detail how you checked that you installed all dependencies? rosdep should pick up on the dependency, as the package manifest for industrial_extrinsic_cal does list it:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package>
  <name>industrial_extrinsic_cal</name>
  ...
  <build_depend>roslint</build_depend>
  ...
</package>

You should be able to install it using sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-roslint.
For future reference: use
rosdep check --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src

to check that you have all (build) dependencies installed.
You can use rosdep install .. to have rosdep install any dependencies that it determines are missing.
