Q:

[ROS2] Call launch file from another launch file

Hello,
Is it possible (and how) to call a launch file from another launch file? I believe that was possible on ROS with the "include" tag, but I do not know how to do it on ROS2 with the .launch.py file.

A:

The LaunchDescription can be used.
This was discussed in the past at https://answers.ros.org/question/306935/ros2-include-a-launch-file-from-a-launch-file/.
An example in Autoware.auto:
