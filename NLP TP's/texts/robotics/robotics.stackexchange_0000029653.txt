Q:

How to use a package from cturtle in diamondback

Hi,
I would like to know how to use a package, say image_view for cturtle in diamondback. I tried to copy and paste in the diamondback, but, too many in dependencies have to resolve.
I guess there will be an elegant way of doing it.
Thanks in advance..

Please don't put [SOLVED] in the title.  Also, don't mark every question as a community wiki, there is no reason for that.

A:

This is generally not possible. Use the Diamondback version of image_view.

There are often packaging and interface changes that affect compatibility between distribution subcomponents.

The main reason for making distributions is to release a coherent collection of stacks at a common level.

External interfaces maintain compatibility unless there is some important reason for changing.

Running "roswtf" gives me "Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf

Running"echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH" gives "/home/shah/ni/ni:/opt/ros/unstable/stacks" and running "echo $ROS_ROOT" gives "/opt/ros/unstable/ros". How do I change to diamondback because I do not want to use unstable.

Please post echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH output, and echo $ROS_ROOT.

Unfortunately, it didn't work running 'rospack profile'.

Try running 'rospack profile' to update your list of packages known to rospack -- that might help your auto-completion issues.

I actually want to use image_view package. It is there, the executable in the  /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/image_pipeline/image_view/bin directory. In the .../image_view directory, I've already exported the package path using this command: export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$PWD:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. The problem is that when I run to invoke rosrun in the terminal, it is not auto-completing the image_view or the like, instead, it straightaway gives "rosrun image_transport"..huhu. Any ideas??
