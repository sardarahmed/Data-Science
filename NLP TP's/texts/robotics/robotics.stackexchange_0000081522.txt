Q:

Could not find configuration package "camera_info_manager" upon build

I am a beginner and I am trying to install autoware from this link: https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware I followed the following commands on my virtual machine with ros indigo:
cd $HOME
$ git clone https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware.git
$ cd ~/Autoware/ros/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ cd ../..
$ ./catkin_make_release

This last command produces the following error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_info_manager" with any of the following names:

    camera_info_managerConfig.cmake
    camera_info_manager-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "camera_info_manager" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "camera_info_manager_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "camera_info_manager" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.

A:

Looks like the dependency is already defined. You just have to run rosdep install to install all dependency in the workspace (in fact I opened a PR to add a line to run rosdep in the readme).
