Q:

Custom Gazebo world doesn't load

I created a custom gazebo world for my turtleBot constaining several walls and saved it as a .world file. However when I run the world file using the command
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch world_file:=/home/PI/turtlebot_custom_gazebo_worlds/final1.world

the walls that i created do not load. just the turtlebot loads. the process in the terminal starts without giving any error. when i check the .world file the code related to the walls is clearly present.

Might be a bug in your world file. Can you post the file?

Maybe copying the model that represents the walls to ~/.gazebo would solve the problem.

A:

Sorry, silly mistake. The path to the world file was incorrect. It was not loading the custom world and just reverting to the default world without giving a traceback!
