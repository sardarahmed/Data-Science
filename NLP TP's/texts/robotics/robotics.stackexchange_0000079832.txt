Q:

Getting imu_data from jackal in simulation

Hi,
I am using the Jackal robot from Clearpath. I am running the jackal_gazebo simulation and trying to collect odometry and IMU data. I have written code which has the following:

publisher, to publish messages to "jackal_velocity_controller/cmd_vel" topic.

subscriber which subscribes to "jackal_velocity_controller/odom" topic for odometry data and uses a callback function to read from "nav_msgs"

subscriber which subscribes to "imu_data" topic for imu data and uses a callback to read from "sensors"

The publisher and subscribers connect to the same node. The odometry data is available and gets written into a file.
The velocity commands are visible when I do: "rostopic echo /jackal_velocity_controller/cmd_vel"
The imu data, however, is not coming through.
The code has the jackal moving in a straight line with a linear velocity of 2.0 in the 'x' direction. The other values, including, angular are zeros.
I expected some IMU data to come through in simulation even if the given angular velocity was zero.
Am I subscribing to the wrong topic? How can I get the imu data from the jackal in simulation?
Thanks and regards,
rsmitha.

A:

The topic is imu/data not imu_data.
