Q:

Switching between Two Local Planners in Navigation

Hello,
I would like to use both DWAPLanner and my own local planner on a robot, and depending on the situation switch between these two local planners.
Is it a way in Navigation stack to plug two local planners and switch between them?
Thanks

A:

You can do this using dynamic reconfigure. Try running the gui client alongside the nav stack to see how the switching works. To do the switching programmatically, you can use the official python api or see how people have done it in c++ if necessary.

Thanks. so I can manually switch the local planners in gui client, right? Since I need to do it programmatically, is there a sample code that I can use or have a look?

I just tried the gui client, but I couldn't figure out how to plug two local planners at the same time. Currently, in move_base_params.yaml I have set base_local_planner: "dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS"

You can not "plug" two local planners at the same time, you can switch between one or another using the gui and api that paulbovbel pointed out.

But how can I switch between the two? Currently I can only see DWAPlanner in gui, because I have set base_local_planner: "dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS". and if I want to do this switch programmatically, is there a sample code that I can use?

You need to make sure that ROS knows how to locate your custom local planner plugin for it to appear on the GUI (take a look at this: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Writing%20A%20Global%20Path%20Planner%20As%20Plugin%20in%20ROS)
