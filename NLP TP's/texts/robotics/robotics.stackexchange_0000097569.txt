Q:

Why only is a PID controller used in ROS Control?

In the ros_control set of packages, why PID controller specifically is used in joint_state_controller, joint_position_controller, and joint_velocity_controller ? Why not any other control algorithms like MPC and LQR ?

A:

Simple: because they worked sufficiently well for the (original) developers/maintainers of those packages, and no one else has made an effort to contribute more advanced algorithms.
If you see an opportunity to contribute something, please do.
