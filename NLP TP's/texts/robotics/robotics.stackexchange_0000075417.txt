Q:

The difference between static library(.a) and shared object library(.so)

Dear All,
Could anybody explain what difference between static library(.a) and shared object(.so) is in ROS library types?
How can I build them? Is there another type?
I have written a c++ class and build it as separate ROS pkg available for other ROS pkgs. Is it a static library?
Thanks for your explanations.

A:

Whilst not directly an answer of mine, this topic is too old to answer afresh!
Stackoverflow Question 1
Stackoverflow Question 2
These explain it all fairly well.
