Q:

Turtlebot forward/backward movement inverted in rviz

We have been working with the "SLAM Map Building with TurtleBot" tutorial for a couple of days now. There is however a strange problem when moving the Turtlebot around; namely that is moves backwards in rviz when we are moving it forward and vica verse. Left and right movement seems to be acting normal, only forward and backward movement is inverted.
Does anyone happen to know why this could be happening?
Thanks in advance.

Hi, I'm facing the same issue, can you please suggest what needs to be done?

A:

Sounds to me as though your teleop code may have been changed thus inverting the drive parameters. What packages are you using to drive your turtlebot around? If you are using the turtlebot_teleop node your Up=Forward should read 1.0 and Down=backwards should read -1.0. I would use rostopic echo to figure out what your teleop is publishing. Also what version of ros are you using?
