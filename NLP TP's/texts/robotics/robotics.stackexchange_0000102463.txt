Q:

Do ros2 have available four_wheel_steering controller?

Hi!
Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language.
So, I have four wheeled robot on ROS Noetic and I trying to port it on ROS2 Galactic. One of my main problems right now is I can't find four_wheel controller for my robot, and migrating of my old controller wasn't very successful. Coul'd you help me? All that I found is this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR47Y7p4mtQ where you can find link on the currently existing controllers, but four_wheel_steering controller is not one of them and won't be for I don't know how long.

A:

Here's the list of available controllers, at least the officially maintained ones:   https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers
It looks like the closest right now is the tricycle controller. Possibly you could make that work for your application.
