Q:

Adding meshes to URDF using HTTPS URLs

I'm trying to figure out if I can add meshes to a URDF using HTTPS URLs instead of using package:// or file://. I wasn't able to find any references about it online, or even any info stating it's not possible.
Is it possible to add meshes this way? I'm using ROS 2 Humble.

A:

Tried it now and yes, it is possible. However, it depends on whether the visualization tool can parse these web URLs or not. I tried it with Rviz and Foxglove and it works.
