Q:

How to set the dynamixel motors to multi-turn mode

I'm trying to use dynamixel MX-106 in ROS, and I want to use it in multi-turn mode.
I could find the way to set it to multi-turn mode in operating manual which can be found in web page of Robotis.
But I can not figure out how to do it in ROS. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.

Hello Kaz-Kom, did you get  the solution for this problem i.e. controlling  Dynamixel motors for multi-turns.
I followed the steps as described in below link:
http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/CreatingAMultiTurnJointController
This is what I did :

Changed the Operating mode (Register number 11) to 4 instead of  3 (default).
Changed the angle limit from 0 to 8192

But still I am not  able to set the multi-turns.
Can somebody let me know what extra changes I have to do to enable multi-turns.

I solved this problem by Factory reset the motor and updating DXL_OPERATING_MODE register before updating DXL_TORQUE_ENABLE register to '1', as DXL_OPERATING_MODE is an EEPROM register and it  has to be updated, before updating DXL_TORQUE_ENABLE register.
