Q:

XnSensorServer CPU consumption

I notice that XnSensorServer is consistently consuming 43% of the CPU resource.  Is there any way of reducing this, and what code is associated with it?

A:

I notice that if I set depth_registration to false within openni_camera then CPU usage drops by 30% to a much more reasonable value.  Is depth_registration just registering the RGB image with the depth image?
