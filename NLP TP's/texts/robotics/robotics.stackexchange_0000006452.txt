Q:

Fuses for mechanical systems

** If there's a better stack exchange site for this, let me know--the mechanical engineering one is closed so I'm not sure where else is appropriate **
Do mechanical systems have fuses? 
In an electrical system, like a charging circuit for example, we prevent large loads from damaging the system with fuses and circuit breakers. These will disconnect the inputs from the outputs if the load get too high. 
Do mechanical systems have a similar mechanism? Something that would prevent gears or linkages from breaking when the load gets too high by disconnecting the input from the output?

A:

You are looking for a clutch.  It is loaded device that 'gives' when the torque exceeds its set amount.

Here is a LEGO clutch you can see how it works.
