Q:

gazebo usage of textures / pictures

I am trying to build a model of robot arm in simulation with checkerboards on it for image recognition. For this I use the simple arm model. Is there somewhere a good description of all the possibilities of urdf / gazebo models?  Because I found from a presentation that you can use for instance patterns:
 <material name="pattern">
    <texture filename="package://roscon_urdf/logo.jpg"/>
</material>

But I could not find this back in the documentation..it did not load either:
 Warning [parser.cc:458] XML Attribute[name] in element[material] not defined in SDF, ignoring.
Error [parser.cc:566] XML Element[texture], child of element[material] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[material]
Error [parser.cc:557] Error reading element
Error [parser.cc:340] Unable to parse sdf element[gazebo]
Error [parser.cc:299] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
Error [World.cc:1099] Unable to read sdf string
 
The material script line from the simple_arm was replaced with the code above. Loaded with
 rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file simple_arm.model -gazebo -model box 
What are the differences between .model .urdf and .sdf files?

Thanks for your response, tags added. At which part does this post not comply with the guidelines?

Just the tags... Thanks.

A:

A description of the SDF format can be found here
while the URDF format is described here.
The code fragment you have presented looks identical to the material statements found in the materials.urdf.xacro file in PR2_description.  If you just want to add a texture to an existing model you may have to create a modified ogre3D material script.  I believe the current (fuerte) script is in simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/share/gazebo-1.0.2/Media/materials/scripts
