Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Robot Roll Out

So I maintain our own little robot and have written many packages (demonstrations, messages, simulation, etc.) to work with it.
Just to give you an example of the package for the Gazebo simulator: https://github.com/tik0/amiro_robot
So my intention is now to clean stuff up and to roll out all packages and documentation to the world.
The point is, I am a bit unsure with how and where to start. For now, I (and my fellows) work still very naively in catkin workspaces with all the packages beeing build in-place.
So the question: Are there guidelines/how-to/care-about to build install-packages, roll-out documention and all that stuff? Of course, I could just look into other famous packages like hector-slam and read through all the REP. But I actually thought more of a red-threat on a how-to roll out.

A:

It may not be as comprehensive as you're asking for, but the wiki/Bloom pages have quite a bit of information about this. The Full guide for releasing with catkin page has the same info, but more dense.
