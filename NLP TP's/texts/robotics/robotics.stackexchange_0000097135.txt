Q:

Rosserial Arduino Compilation Error: No 

Hi, I am using Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic. I followed the rosserial tutorial arduino setup page but I cannot compile the ros_lib HelloWorld example in Arduino. It gives me the following error. I am not able to resolve it and I would like to ask for your help! Thanks a lot!

                 from /home/kk/Arduino/libraries/ros_lib/ros/node_handle.h:40,
                 from /home/kk/Arduino/libraries/ros_lib/ros.h:38,
                 from /home/kk/Arduino/libraries/ros_lib/examples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.pde:6:

A:

Hey, I ran into the same issue and after hours of searching google, I found the following workaround:
First you have to delete the ros_lib folder that was created when you initially ran rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py . It should be located in /home/Arduino/libraries or wherever you installed arduino IDE.
Then open the Arduino IDE, in the menu bar go to Tools -> Manage Libraries and search for "rosserial"
You should see Rosserial Arduino Library by Michael Furguson. Install it, I installed 0.7.9
Now you can try to compile your HellowWorld program again and it should work.
Not sure why this worked but hopefully it works for you too.

Thanks, it solves my problem.

I found that I had to use 0.7.9 as listed above. version 0.9.4 had the same issue.

I got this error from installing the rosserial library through the Arduino IDE library manager. but if i instead ran the python script as the comment explains above (or, taken from this link: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup), everything works fine.
