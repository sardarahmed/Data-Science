Q:

can't add time and duration

Hi,
I am basing myself on this to do some time manipulation in ros. But when I write :
ros::Time beginTime = ros::Time::now();                                                                                                                  
ros::Duration delta_t = ros::Duration(t/2);                                                                                                              
ros::Time t1 = delta_t + beginTime;                                                                                                                      
ros::Time t2 = delta_t + t1;

I get the error
error: no match for ‘operator+’ (operand types are ‘ros::Duration’ and ‘ros::Time’)
ros::Time t1 = delta_t + beginTime;

Why is that? Something has changed since the other post?
Thank you for your help!

A:

On Melodic the time has to come before the duration:
ros::Time t1 = beginTime + delta_t;
ros::Time t2 = t1 + delta_t;

http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Time#Time_and_Duration_Arithmetic shows the proper order (but doesn't say the opposite won't work).
The other post says the code is untested, so the ordering requirement may or may not have changed.
(Update- I fixed the other post to have the correct time + duration ordering)
