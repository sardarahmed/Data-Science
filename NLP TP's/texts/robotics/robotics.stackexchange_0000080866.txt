Q:

Joint with three degrees of freedom URDF

I am currently trying to attach a caster to my robot. Therefore I need a continuous joint with three degrees of freedom.
This is my URDF file. As you can see I tried to stack two continuous joints after each other. Unfortunately, when I try to manipulate them in Rviz I can only see changes in the second joint (base_to_caster2).
Does anybody know how to implement revolute joints with more than one degree of freedom properly?

A:

I was able to solve my problem with a workaround by setting mu1, mu2 to zero and slip1, slip2 to one for the caster. This means, that there will be no friction between the ground and the caster.
Anyway, I am still interested in my initial question. How do I implement a joint with two rotational degrees of freedom? I think this will be relevant for me in the future, since I want to experiment as well with a robotic arm in ROS.
