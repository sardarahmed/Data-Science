Q:

Ros_groovy_Workspace_Creation Catkin_Make Error

There seems to be an error when using catkin_make to create the ROS workspace using groovy distribution. When i type the catkin_make command to do environment setup in ~/catkin_ws/src, this is the error message i see.
CMake Error at /home/shaurya/ros_ws/devel/share/baxter_sim_kinematics/cmake/baxter_sim_kinematicsConfig.cmake:165 (find_package):
  Could not find module Findbaxter_core_msgs.cmake or a configuration file
  for package baxter_core_msgs.

  Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find Findbaxter_core_msgs.cmake or set
  baxter_core_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
  for baxter_core_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

    baxter_core_msgsConfig.cmake
    baxter_core_msgs-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):

A:

Your build is failing to find a dependency in either your system installation or your local workspace. The dependency in this case is baxter_core. You should ether install it to your system or add it to your workspace to compile.
