Q:

Required tf for overlaying laser on image using Camera display type

Hi.
I'd like to display laser scanner on captured image in rviz using Camera display type.
(as like http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/DisplayTypes/Camera)
I have published following tf.
Also camera_info is properly published. Also image is okay.
I can see some axis on image but not laser line.
Any suggestions?

A:

Provided the tf transforms are correctly set up and the scanner is outputting laser_scan data, this should work. A few things you could check:

Check that tf is working

Do you see other visualization
elements in the camera view? (i.e.
the grid, the arrow pointer when
giving a 2D nav goal etc.)

Have you set the fixed frame in rviz
properly?

Does it work with other robots/launch files? The Turtlebot or hector_quadrotor gazebo simulations for instance can be used to quickly check that.

Is your camera calibrated correctly? The camera view rectifies images, so this has to be correct.

Finally, be sure that you have set the "Overlay Alpha" of your camera view to something like 0.5.

My fault was that the camera should be z-forward. :-)

Hi, it passed quite a while.. anyway. I guess I'm facing the same problem. How did you finally solved the "z-forward camera" thing?

REP-103 specifies that the coordinate frame reported by a camera should have the z-axis of the frame pointing in the direction that the camera is looking.
