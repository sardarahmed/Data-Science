Q:

ROS for Ubuntu Release: 17.10/artful?

Would someone here know what the plans for a release of ROS for Ubuntu 17.10?  I have to be on 17.10 but I am not finding any compiled package for that on the Internet.
Thanks!

Related question: #q277021 (provides a work-around with Docker).

Good to know; but unfortunately that is not a good option for me as I am on VirtualBox and Docker and VirtualBox at times don't get along very well. :-(

The idea was to use the Dockerfile only as a recipe. It shows the exact steps that would let you build Lunar on an Ubuntu Artful installation from source. Using it as a Docker container is possible, but not at all needed.
(you probably know this already, but ROS (RViz) in a VM can be difficult)

A:

ROS Melodic will support Ubuntu 17.10 once it's released.
REP-0003 is the place where supported platforms and libraries are specified.
Note that the support for non-LTS Ubuntu distros like 17.10 will be terminated when the corresponding support for Ubuntu reaches EOL (end-of-life) (e.g. announcement of ROS Lunar ending supporting Ubuntu 17.04).
