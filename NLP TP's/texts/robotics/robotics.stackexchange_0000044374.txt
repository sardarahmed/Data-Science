Q:

output update of ROBOT_POSE_EKF is 5 sec. Can I get them faster?

Question 1.. Can I just use wheel odometry data and imu data and get effective kalman updated data using robot_pose_ekf package?Is there any package which is more handy which I overlooked?
Question 2..
The output of /robot_pose_ekf/odom_combined is same as the /pose published by wheel odometry. Do I have to make any changes?
Question3..Message update rate is around 5 sec and can I decrease it ?
I tried changing the freq parameter in robot_pose_ekf.launch from 30 hz to 120 hz but the update comes around once in 5 sec.
Sometimes the output does not start immediately.

A:

Finally after three days, found the answer...
First the error was
"Could not transform the imu messages from /base_imu to /base_footprint"
This was found from the rxconsole output.
TF tree was connected.
It was solved by changing the (/base_imu)frame id of IMU to /base_footprint
Thats it...:)

did that

This helped me figure out why EKF's update rate was incorrect. Just like in your case, the EKF node was complaining about the IMU messages not having base_footprint IDs. After specifying "base_footprint" for the "frame_id" param for the IMU node, the EKF node's rate increased to 5Hz - our GPS rate
