Q:

costmap_2d clear obstacles after every update

Hi,
I am creating costmaps of highly dynamic obstacles and want it to be efficiently cleared just before every update, so that each time only the current point cloud is projected into the map and there is no trace of what was previously projected.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks.

A:

I don't believe you can do this with the costmap layers as they are currently structured, but you could write a subclass of the obstacle_layer that clears all information from the map on every iteration.

There is a protected member resetMaps(), I tried to change its scope to public and called it in the layered_costmap function that updates maps. But I can't see any topic published. Even if I reset everything to the original source code pulled from Git, it compiles and runs, but there is no topic
