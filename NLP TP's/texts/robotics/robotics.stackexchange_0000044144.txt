Q:

How can I disable smach state transition log messages?

Every time that smach performs a transition to a new state, it issues an Info log message indicating the time and the transition made.
Is there a way of disabling those messages?.
I have read the following related questions, but found no answer to this problem:

Does rxloggerlevel help? Maybe they are in a named logger.

I don't think rxloggerlevel works for Python logging.

No, it doesn't, as indicated in http://answers.ros.org/question/10299/rospy-logging/

I updated the thread http://answers.ros.org/question/10299/rospy-logging/?answer=103161#post-id-103161. In nutshell; rospy logger can/should be tracked now.

A:

Two things.
First, please create a ticket for this on the SMACH trac here: https://kforge.ros.org/smach/trac/newticket
Second, if you want to just change all of the SMACH loginfo calls to logdebug in an overlay, you can just modify line 44 of executive_smach/smach_ros/src/__init__.py and replace "rospy.loginfo" with "rospy.logdebug".
As @joq points out, there's no easy way to switch python logger levels at runtime. Because of this, we made it so that this information is reported at the info level because more often than not we wanted to see the information, but not all of the minute "debug" logging output that you would see in Python.
