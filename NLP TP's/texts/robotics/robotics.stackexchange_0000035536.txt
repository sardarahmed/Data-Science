Q:

roslaunch for multi-robot team

Hello all:
I want to write a roslaunch file to launch the same set of nodes, identically configured, on a number of robots.  What's the most economical way to write a launch file or files to do that?  The requirements are:

There are about 20 parameters to configure each node.  I want to set the parameters in only one place, so I don't want these to be renamed/remapped.
Each robot runs six nodes that publish four topics and provide one service.  These were not written with multiple robots in mind, so they must each be renamed, e.g. from "/cmd_vel" to "/machine1/cmd_vel."

In this case "economical" means not only short, but requiring the least work to add and subtract robots from the ensemble.  I thought of writing a launch file for a single robot and then including it multiple times in a master file:
Wouldn't that change the parameter names along with the topic and service names?  It also seems a little clunky.  Is there a better way?
Bonus question: I wish I knew an easy way to supply each robot with a list of all the others in the launch file, or even just a list of all the robots on the team.
Thank you.

A:

Take a look here, here, and here. The third link is probably the most relevant. Take a look at section 1.3. These pages talk about running ROS across multiple machines. The nodes to run on any machine will be configured with the <machine> tag.

Just a word of caution: Don't do this over an unreliable (e.g. wireless) connection. Check http://ros.org/wiki/rocon_multimaster for something to do actual distributed ROS.
