Q:

octomap simple_example.cpp compilation error

After success in building 3d maps i am trying to play with them for example: to detect tables in the 3d map. So trying to run the sample program. In the documentation it is said simple.cpp is an example but i could not find it neither in ros-octomap nor standalone octomap. But i found simple_example.cpp in standalone octomap folder which seems to be the updated file of simple.cpp.
But i am unable to compile it. Am i missing something ??

Please use the OctoMap mailing list for support that is not related to ROS: http://groups.google.com/group/octomap If you think you found a bug, just submit an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap
