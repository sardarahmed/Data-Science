Q:

Hi, how can I subscribe the node(topic cmd_vel) of turtlesim to the node of my model?

Hi, I have build a model in gazebo ROS which is moving through teleop keyboard. I want to subscribe cmd_vel of turtlesim to my model and move turtlesim along with my model. Do you have any idea how can I subscribe the node of turtlesim to the node of my model?

A:

via command line:
You can remap topics with /old_topic:=/new_topic.  In your case:
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node /turtle1/cmd_vel:=/my_gazebo_robot/cmd_vel
via launch file:
Within the node, you can use the remap tag.
<node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="sim">
  <remap from="/turtle1/cmd_vel" to="/my_gazebo_robot/cmd_vel" />
</node>

You can check if either method worked with rostopic list and rostopic info /my_gazebo_robot/cmd_vel. Note that /my_gazebo_robot might be several directories deep (such as if you have a base controller).
