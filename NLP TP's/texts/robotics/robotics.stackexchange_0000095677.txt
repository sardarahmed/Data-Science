Q:

Failed to process package 'roscpp':

Hello, I hope all of you are doing awesome.
I recently bought a raspberry pi 4 with just 1 GB of RAM
My raspberry is running Raspbian buster Lite.
I followed these instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Source.
However when invoking catkin_make_isolated
I get the following error:
e::CallbackInfo&, const ros::CallbackQueue::CallbackInfo*>’ changed in GCC 7.1
/usr/include/c++/8/bits/stl_deque.h:397:18: note: parameter passing for argument of type ‘std::_Deque_iterator<ros::CallbackQueue::CallbackInfo, const ros::CallbackQueue::CallbackInfo&, const ros::CallbackQueue::CallbackInfo*>’ changed in GCC 7.1

<== Failed to process package 'roscpp':
  Command '['/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh', 'make', '-j4', '-l4']' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/roscpp && /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4

Command failed, exiting.

Any advice would be of huge help.
Thanks to you all in advance.

A:

Looks like raspberry is running out of memory when building the workspace:
Changed make parameter to -j2 and was able to solve it.
