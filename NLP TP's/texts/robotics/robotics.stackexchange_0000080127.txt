Q:

I'm using CAT simulation and I added sonars to the jeep in the simulation using hector gazebo but I keep getting an error in rviz

I keep getting the error " Transform [sender=unknown publisher]For frame [/sonar link]: Frame [/sonar link] does not exist "
I tried all the solutions provided in the ROS answers but still I face this issue.
Changes that I made to the simulation files:

Added sonar in the .xacro file, .gazebo file.

2.Also added the static transform publisher in the .launch file as

3.I ran the rosrun --debug rviz rviz and tried publishing the link.
4.I made changes to the gazebo_ros_sonar.cpp in the hector gazebo package.
But I still getting the error while running rviz and adding the sonar in it.
Please, suggest me an alternative possible solutions. ?

A:

The problem is the name of the frame that needs to be exactly as the name of the link.
Example:
<link name="sonar1_link">
...
</link>
<plugin ...>
        ...
        <frameId>sonar1_link</frameId>
</plugin>
