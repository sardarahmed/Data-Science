Q:

Trying to get position data from Aruco Package

Hi all,
I am trying to get position data using the aruco ros package. I can get the marker to appear in the the screen, and it will be highlighted. But, no position data is being published to the markers topic. If I output to the screen in the launch file, there is output that identifies the marker, and has 4 2D points, as well as a 3D translation matrix, and a rotation transform(from what I read on the Aruco site). The last two are all 0. But the 2D points seem to be what I want. What topic should these be broadcasting on? And also I am assuming I'll need the transformation matrix and rotation transform, could they be defaulting to zero since I don't have a camera config file, because that is the case.

A:

As it turned out the yaml configuration file was missing. Once I added(even a dummy one) it was able to broadcast it's position.
