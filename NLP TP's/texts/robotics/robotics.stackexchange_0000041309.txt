Q:

robot_pose_ekf publish rate?

I'm having trouble getting the robot_pose_ekf node running correctly.  I have a nav_msgs::Odometry topic from a GPS sensor publishing at 1Hz on the 'vo' topic and an sensor_msgs::Imu publishing at 20 Hz on the 'imu_data' topic.  However, over the course of a minute long run, the odom_combined topic is only publishing 5-6 messages.
The parameters I've used in the launch file are:
param name="output_frame" value="odom_combined"<br>
param name="freq" value="20.0"<br>
param name="sensor_timeout" value="1.0"<br>
param name="odom_used" value="false"<br>
param name="imu_used" value="true"<br>
param name="vo_used" value="true"<br>

My data is being published from a bag file.  Could this be an issue at all?  Why else might the ekf node not be publishing at the rate given by freq?
Thanks,
Josh

Thanks, for some reason, every time I read that wiki page I understood it to mean it would publish once just a single initial data point had been published on each sensor topic.

A:

since your gps is operating at 1 Hz, i think the maximum frequency with which you can publish is 1 Hz. This is because according to basic ekf, the predictor is updated as and when the data from the imu is available and then when the gps data is available, the values are corrected and then published.
I think this is reason why you can't publish at 20 Hz.
ATB!
