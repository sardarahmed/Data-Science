Q:

Adding global models (e.g. wind)

I am new to Gazebo and for my application I would need to add several dynamic models, the state of which influences the robot models present in the world.
A simple example could be a (time varying) wind model that needs to be accessed from within the robot models in order to compute aerodynamic forces.
From the gazebo documentation I was not able to work out what is the best way to implement something like the above.
Any suggestion?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I would create a WorldPlugin that contains the wind model. This model could either publish messages about the wind, or directly influence models.
Here is a tutorial about WorldPlugins:

Creating a WorldPlugin makes perfect sense. However I am not at all clear how I would get hold of the affected robot models in order to influence them directly (e.g. by applying a force). Could you point me to a place in the Gazebo code in which is shown how the world directly influences a model?

You can try looking at the SpringTestPlugin and also the Gazebo physics API.

Could you please fixed that broken links?
I'm trying to do the same, but I cannot look into those links
