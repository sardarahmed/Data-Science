Q:

Getting "Aria.h: file not found" when installing rosaria

Ubuntu 12.04.3, ros groovy.
I am following a ROSARIA tutorial (can't post links)
I know that it is an hydro tutorial, but I have the same issue with groovy version. Everything works well until catkin_make command at point 1.4.
I allways get this:

RosAria.cpp:3:18: error fatal: Aria.h: No such file or directory.
Compilation finished.
make[2]:  [rosaria/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/RosAria.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]:  [rosaria/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/all] Error 2
make:[all] Error 2 
Invoking "make" failed

Where should be placed that header file? Where can I find it?
Thanx for your time! :)

Aria.h should be in /usr/local/Aria/include.   You must either use rosdep update; rosdep install rosaria, or install ARIA seperately.
Are you using this: http://wiki.ros.org/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA ? Note that the instructions for groovy and hydro are different there.

Hi! thanks for your help. Yes, I am using that tutorial. "rosdep update" and "rosdep install rosaria" commands end with no errors. The problem comes with "catkin_make". I tried both groovy and hydro versions because hydro one worked fine for a co-worker. But both versions die at catkin_make step.

Does /usr/local/Aria/include/Aria.h exist? If so, what is printed out by catkin_make before that error?

MAN!! /usr/local/Aria/include dir is completely empty :S, but I got no errors  previous steps

A:

It looks like rosdep install rosaria is not correctly installing the ARIA header files.  You can instead install one of these packages (use dpkg -i ...):
For 32-bit http://robots.mobilerobots.com/ARIA/download/current/libaria_2.8.0+ubuntu12+gcc4.6_i386.deb
For 64-bit
http://robots.mobilerobots.com/ARIA/download/current/libaria_2.8.0+ubuntu12+gcc4.6_amd64.deb
And then try catkin_make (without running rosdep).
...
If you want to help troubleshoot the underlying problem you can do this:
sudo apt-get remove libaria-sourcedep
rosdep install rosaria >log 2>&1
Then attach the log file here or put it on pastebin.com or send it to me reed.hedges@adept.com
