Q:

How to make "catkin build" build static libs?

I am using catkin_tools with melodic and would like to define static libraries system-wide, or at least workspace-wide. I don't want to manually change every CMakeLists.txt in my workspace.

A:

It works by adding the CMake-Variable to the catkin config;
catkin config -a --cmake-args -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0
