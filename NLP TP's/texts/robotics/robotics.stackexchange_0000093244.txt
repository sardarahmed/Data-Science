Q:

Why is A* used as global planner in move_base?

Can someone shed some light on why A* star is used for global planner in move_base. I can see that there is an option to use Djikstra's algorithm as well. What are the main benefits of A* as opposed to using RRT or RRT*?

Outside of RRT, here are my thoughts on using A* vs Djikstras
