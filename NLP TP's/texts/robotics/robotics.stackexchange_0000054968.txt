Q:

timing problem with laser scan (synchronizing with odometry)

Hi guys,
I've got a timing problem with my laser scans. I receive laser scan data through a tcp socket (it's simulated laser data from another system in the network). While the robot is standing still everything is fine. But as soon as it moves/turns, the laser scan gets biased depending on how fast the robot is moving/turning. It looks like the scans are stamped wrong in relation to odometry/tf.
At the moment I stamp all my sensor data with the time stamp of the moment they arrive in the node. I suppose there is some kind of offset due to the time some of my data needs to get through ROS.
So, how can I synchronize my nodes to get rid of the speed depending bias?
Thank you!
Cheers,
Hendrik

A:

From our experience the recommend way to syncronize machines is using the chrony ntp client. There's a few notes here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup
If you are running on a system that does cannot be syncronized or you are going to be using system time @skiesel's answer would be the way to go.

I see and I agree - synchronizing both systems would be a great help. Is it possible to synchronize a Linux and a Windows system like this? My simulator runs on a Windows machine.

Yeah, it's just using NTP, there should be plenty of windows clients.  And it's probably builtin too.

Alright, I'll give it a try. Thanks a lot!
