Q:

openni_tracker make fails with missing files

During rosmake of openni_kinect on OS X SL, openni_tracker fails complaining of missing files, like this:
/Users/john_muccigrosso/ros/openni_kinect/openni_tracker/src/openni_tracker.cpp:8:22: error: XnOpenNI.h: No such file or directory

There's a series of them, all beginning with Xn.
I've seen this, and I have geometry installed already. I have gotten openni_tracker to install in the past.
Thoughts?

A:

These are from the OpenNI drivers.  Did you install them onto your system?  They are rosdeps of openni_kinect and need to be installed before compiling.  The drivers can be found here

OK. I have OpenNI drivers that, IIRC, I got as binaries from PrimeSense because I couldn't compile them on my OS X system. Where do I put them so that ros sees them? Or can I modify my rospath in some way to do that?
