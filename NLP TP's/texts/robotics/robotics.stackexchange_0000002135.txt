Q:

Algebraic and geometric in inverse kinematic

I'm just wondering that is there any case that when algebraic way can't solve the problem while the geometric can ? Cause I'm working on a 2DOF robotics arm This one, I know the length of L1 and L2, location that I want for the end effector, then I tried calculating the angles by using algebraic but it gave me cos(alpha) > 1, but when I tried solving with geometric, I can find the solution, so is it because I use a wrong way in algebraic ? 
Thank you very much.

A:

Absolutely not! If the geometric method yields a solution, so should the algebraic method or any other method for that matter, if done correctly.
The problem posed here is the inverse kinematics of a 2R serial robot. This is a trivial example solved in many books in different ways.  I would recommend this article for an exposition on obtaining the solution to this problem (and more) in different ways.
The question of defining a "better" method is better left alone and depends on the problem at hand. Algebraic methods are more generic and can be applied to any mechanism, whereas geometric methods are easy to visualize and so seem simple but are prone to errors as the mechanism at hand gets complicated (imagine solving spatial robots of more than 3-degrees of freedom or a general 6R robot geometrically!).
