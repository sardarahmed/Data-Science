Q:

How can I download camera Gazebo

Hi Ros users:
I would like to download the pkg of this camera which Gazebo provides us:

So I would like that when I launch a .launch the camera is in the same place and I would like to be able to access topics (for example "camera/link/camera/image" as you can see below on the pic) in the terminal or in RVIZ.
So it is possible to download this camera as pkg? Or to do that in any way?
Thanks!!!

A:

You can insert models to your world from gazebo model database using the insert tab on the gazebo simulator. When you insert a particular model it will get downloaded locally in your ~/.gazebo/models/package_name. If you want the camera model to be a part of your world you can follow this tutorial .
