Q:

Checksum md5sum mismatch when using Joystick

Hi, I'm trying to let drone hover using motion capture system. However, it failed because of the joystick problem maybe.
It seems I should ask people who made drone, and actually I did, but didn't solved.
They say it might be a general ros question, so I am asking here.
The error is this.
client wants service /crazyflie/takeoff to have md5sum d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e, but it has b665b6c83a196e4774268cc26329b159. Dropping connection.

crazyflie is the name of the drone.
When I push the button which let drone takeoff, the error occurred.
How can I fix it?

Please describe your setup in more detail. I assume you have an on-board controller on the drone running ROS, as well as a Laptop/Desktop PC running ROS as well. Doublecheck that you do have the same ROS version on both systems and the same package version of the package containing the service definition.

Sorry for late replying. You're right. Just the different version problem.

A:

I deleted the package and tried another new package, and it works.
