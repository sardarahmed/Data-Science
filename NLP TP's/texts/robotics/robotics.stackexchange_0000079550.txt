Q:

ROS websocker error. Unable to accept incoming connection. Reason: 'bson_only_mode'

Hello,
I am trying to use baxter_web_interface package.
After launching roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch I am trying to establish connection over port 9090 using webpage,  it gives my those errors,
[INFO] [WallTime: 1489421469.154949] Rosbridge WebSocket server started on port 9090
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1489421864.967072] Unable to accept incoming connection. Reason: 'bson_only_mode'

'package error' as in: in rosbridge or in baxter_web?
Could you perhaps provide a link to an issue that you reported?
