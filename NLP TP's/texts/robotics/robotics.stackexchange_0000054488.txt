Q:

Calibrating xsens IMU

Hi every one,
I have a Xsens MTi IMU,
When I get data from it using xsens_driver in ros, I found some numbers that are not the real numbers.
when IMU is stable I see numbers and not changing, these numbers like accelartion should be zero but they aren't.
I think my sensor need a calibration. but I can not do it.
any one can help how to calibrate this sensor?

If you observe the orientation field, you will see four variables instead of three,
as you would probably expect. This is because in ROS, the spatial orientation is
represented using quaternions.
