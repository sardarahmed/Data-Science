Hello Jacob Perron, Hello community,
is there a reason, why the excelent create_autonomy

package did not exists at the official ros (kinetic) repository ?
Thanks for a hint

A:

Hello Chrimo,
It's just one of those things that I never got to doing, but indeed plan to. I want to release libcreate first, followed by create_autonomy. I haven't felt any pressure to release, although I realize it will make it more accessible. If there is a strong desire from the community to have it released I will take the time to do so :)
Cheers,
Jacob
