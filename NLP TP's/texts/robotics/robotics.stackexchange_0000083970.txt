Q:

turtlebot sim crashes on subscribing to any topic

First I run the turtlebot run launch file from the terminal:
    $ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

Then in a new terminal:
     $ rostopic echo /scan

As soon as I subscribe to the /scan topic i get the following  error:
gzserver: /build/ogre-1.9-mqY1wq/ogre-1.9-1.9.0+dfsg1/OgreMain/src/OgreRenderSystem.cpp:546: virtual void Ogre::RenderSystem::setDepthBufferFor(Ogre::RenderTarget*): Assertion `bAttached && "A new DepthBuffer for a RenderTarget was created, but after creation" "it says it's incompatible with that RT"' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)

[gazebo-1] process has died [pid 21624, exit code 134, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver -e ode /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds/playground.world __name:=gazebo __log:=/home/pranav/.ros/log/f18cc0fc-ccc2-11e7-9a30-9cb6d0e527e7/gazebo-1.log].

Hi @inani47, did you manage to fix that ? I am having the same issue of gazebo crashing with no reason when launching it with ros and this version of Ogre.

@monabf sorry for the late reply. I was able to resolve the issue by updating to a newer version of Gazebo. All the best!

A:

To expand - I also got around this by updating to a newer version of Gazebo (I'm running Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04).
I followed the "Alternative Installation" instructions here (with an important exception noted below):
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu
IMPORTANT NOTE - if you're on Kinetic, you want to install "gazebo7" NOT "gazebo9" (which would be for Melodic)
Hope that helps - I spent many hours on Google figuring this out. But now the examples in Chapter 7 of Programming Robots with ROS run (as far as I've tried).
Cheers,
/K
