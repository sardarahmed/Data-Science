Q:

gazebo gui camera slows down when zooming out a lot

Hello,
I'm using gazebo version  11 and I noticed that when I zoom out a lot, the ui camera behavior changes :

when trying to rotate, it rotates around a point in the air,
same thing happens when trying to move along x,y
the zoom in and zoom out slows down...

Do you know if there is anyway to suppress this behavior ?
Thank you

A:

I answered on my own after a long time : There were clouds in the sky so each time I went above the clouds , gazebo was focusing on the clouds and not the ground anymore
