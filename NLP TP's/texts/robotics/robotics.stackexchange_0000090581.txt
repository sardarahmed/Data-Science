Q:

Unable to uninstall ros-indigo before re-intall from the beginning

Greetings,
I'm a newbie and have an Ubuntu 14.04 computer with ROS indigo loaded on it. I was trying to install ros-indigo-navigation, where I encountered dependency issues. I tried various suggestions and nothing worked. So, I decided to uninstall ROS and reinstall the full desktop version from the beginning. I am having trouble even uninstalling ROS.
for sudo apt-get remove ros-* or for sudo apt-get purge ros-* I get the error saying that Unable to locate package ros-apt.txt and couldn't find any package by regex 'ros-apt.txt'
I did find a file by that name in my home directory though. Any suggestions on how to overcome this and help me reinstall ROS-indigo is very much appreciated.

A:

The shell will expand * as a file wildcard, so it doesn't get passed to apt.
If you don't want the shell to do any file expansions, use single quotes around the arguments you don't want expanded:
sudo apt-get remove '^ros-*'

Brilliant. I don't know why I didn't think of this even though I'm from the UNIX world! Thanks, it worked.

You may want to use '^ros-*' to make sure that you only uninstall things starting with ros. I'm not 100% sure about this but I've seen it recommended on this site before
