Q:

problem in transform from map to base

Hi,
when i am setting up a navigation stack for my pioneer robot but when i am running move_base.launch after receiving a static map from map_server its writing below warning:
"Waiting on transform from /base_footprint to /map to become available before running costmap , tf error."
currently my tf_tree is something like this:
odom_combined---> base_footprint ----> base_laser

A:

Do you have amcl or gmapping running? When using a static map published by the map server, you need to run amcl. It will localize your robot in the map and publish the transform from map to odom_combined.
