Q:

Undefined reference to callback function in subscriber

I am trying to use callback inside a class, is this possible for indigo version ?
I have double and triple checked my syntax and I have run out of ideas why the compiler complains, undefined reference to foo::callback
any advice on where to look would be helpful.

This is definitely possible, and Indigo has not changed anything wrt this.
crystal.ball.net is down at the moment, could you please include a C++ snippet that shows your callback method, and where you instantiate your subscriber? And your CMakeLists.txt, seeing as you post a linker error.

A:

@gvdhoom thank you for insisting it would be a syntax issue. After trying to find the bug and staring at the screen it just turns out that in my member function definition instead of void foo::callback(..) I just had void callback( .. ). I kept looking at the subscriber syntax. *facepalm
