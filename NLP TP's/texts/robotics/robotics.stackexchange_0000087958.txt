Q:

How to Load a URDF File to RVIZ

Hi everyone,
I have a URDF file of my own robot, but I don't know how to load it to RVIZ.
I've googled but still don't get it.
I'm very new to ROS. Any help will be appreciated.
If there is a step-by-step tutorial, that will be even better.

Hi David! Do I create a package and put URDF in src? Where do I place the launch file?
Comment by David Lu on 2018-07-16:
Yes, both could go in a package called robotname_description.
