Q:

Creating a lighter than air model

Hello all.
I would like to create a lighter than air model in Gazebo that can be,  at first, just a balloon. I would like to  know if there is some standard way to build this kind of model and, if so, where can I find reference materials (documentation, article, book) on how to do it. Any information will be appreciated.
Thanks.

A:

You could use the buoyancy plugin, take a look at the tutorial:

It is a great start. Thanks. But, for the specific case of an airship, the Aerodynamics plugin would be more appropriate, right? Or, should I stick with the Hydrodynamics one?

The aerodynamics LiftDrag plugin could be used to propel your airship and the buoyancy plugin could be used to keep it afloat, take a look at the submarine model as an example: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/src/220aa60a2eaa5f31b52429d08c8e94bd05646e23/submarine/model.sdf?fileviewer=file-view-default#model.sdf-190
