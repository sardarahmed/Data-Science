Q:

PR2 teleoperation in simulation

Hello all,
Is there a tutorial on how to get the realtime teleoperation controllers (like JTTeleop) working in the gazebo PR2 simulation?  I can't seem to find one and my own attempts haven't worked so far.
Thanks,
Dan

I've figured out what needs to be done, and drafted the tutorial:
