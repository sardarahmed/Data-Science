Q:

REQUIRED process [open_manipulator_dynamixel_controller-2] has died!

I just tried to operate open manipulator system by using two motor(MX-106).
When I launch that code, the following error occur.
roslaunch open_manipulator_dynamixel_ctrl dynamixel_controller.launch

I already let the USB accss allow, but it is not working too.
What would I do to solve this error??
started roslaunch server http://localhost:*****/

Just an observation:

setting /run_id to *****

why remove this from the roslaunch output? It's a randomly generated UUID. There's no way to relate that to any specific machine/person/location.

I don't know that exactly. So I remove that. Is it necessary to know that for solving the problem? If so, I will post my error message again. Thanks for letting me know.

No, it's most likely not important. Neither is my question, I was just surprised.

A:

Hi :)
open_manipulator_dynamixel_controller is compatible with protocol 2.0.
This video would be help you to replace it to MX-106(2.0)

And this is wiki page for it
