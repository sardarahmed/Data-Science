Q:

How can i manipulate "ros::TimerEvent& event" from a callback time function?

I want to get data out of event, as explained in 1.4 of :
http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp_tutorials/Tutorials/Timers
But the problem is i don't know how to convert ros::time into double variable, am process further... i don't even know how to write what the obiect "event" contains using ROS_INFO, or something.

A:

It's not ros::time, it's ros::Time (capitalizing the 'T' is necessary).
You can use the toSec method of a Time instance to get the time as a double (see the Time Overview wiki).
The API for Time can be found here, while the API for its superclass TimeBase can be found here.
An example of using ROS_INFO for the last_real member of a received TimerEvent instance tEvent might look like so:
void callback1(const ros::TimerEvent& tEvent) {
  ROS_INFO("Event last_real time: %f", tEvent.last_real.toSec());
}
