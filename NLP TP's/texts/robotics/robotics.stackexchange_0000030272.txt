Q:

roswtf warnings: unexpectedly connected

Hello,
when I run roswtf I get the following warning. Why does it think the nodes are unexpectedly connected?
Found 1 warning(s).
Warnings are things that may be just fine, but are sometimes at fault

WARNING The following nodes are unexpectedly connected:
 * /rviz_1299863506781450302->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /openni_node1->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /kinect_base1_link2->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /openni_node2->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /kinect_base_link1->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /kinect_base_link->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /kinect_base2_link3->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /kinect_base1_link3->/rosout (/rosout)
 * /kinect_base2_link2->/rosout (/rosout)

Best,
CV

A:

These messages are normal (but annoying).
As it says: "warnings are things that may be just fine, but are sometimes at fault".
I would like to know how to eliminate them, too.

Good to know but still a bit unsatisfying. If the condition is normal then why is there a warning at all? Under what conditions can it be ignored?
