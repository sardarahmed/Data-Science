Q:

Launching usb_cam on a remote Machine

Hi ROS-Community,
as the title already says I want to Launch the usb_cam Node on a Raspberry Pi from my main Computer. Although there are many Question regarding the usb_cam not working, I can't find one that deals with the <machine> tag. :(
The Launch file works on my main Computer and the Pi locally (so i guess the param are not the problem), but if I use the <machine> tag to start it remotely i get the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [usb_cam/usb_cam_node.cpp]: usb_cam
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/stacks

launch file:
<launch>
  <machine name="pi" address="192.168.0.48" env-loader="/opt/ros/kinetic/env.sh" user="me" default="true" />
  <node name="usb_cam_2" pkg="usb_cam" type="usb_cam_node.cpp" output="screen">
    <param name="video_device" value="/dev/video0" />
    <param name="image_width" value="1920" />
    <param name="image_height" value="1080" />
    <param name="pixel_format" value="yuyv" />
    <param name="camera_frame_id" value="usb_cam" />
    <param name="io_method" value="mmap"/>
  </node>
</launch>

I think the problem lies here: env-loader="/opt/ros/kinetic/env.sh", but as I am kinda new to ROS I don't know what to do about it. :(
Greetings Jamrock

Please use the Preformatted Text button next time to format console copy-pastes and code and launch files. It's the one with 101010 on it.
Thanks.

A:

type="usb_cam_node.cpp"

I'm not saying this will resolve all your issues, but a C++ source file is not something that can be launched.
You'll want to launch the binary, ie: usb_cam_node (no .cpp).

You guessed correct, it did not change anything regarding the Error. Nevertheless i changed it and thank you for the fast answer. :)

It did not change anything? That is strange, as it should now no longer be looking for the usb_cam/usb_cam_node.cpp node.

I really don't know why it didn't change anything, but I think it doesn't find the package at all. I tried to use the machine tag with the turtlesim_node from the tutorial on my computer and the turtle_teleop_key on the Pi. Although I couldn't move the turtle I didn't get any errors.
