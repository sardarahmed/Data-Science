Q:

Velodyne 64 to 32

I'm new here so forgive me. I understand there is some Velodyne 64 data capture and packet reading code here some where (where though?). I'd like to find it and modify it for the Velodyne 32. Is that possible?
I haven't ready any of the site rules, etc. yet.

A:

It's the first link, when you google: velodyne ROS.
The license says BSD, so you can use and modify the code.
