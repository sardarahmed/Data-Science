Q:

How to build the sick_tim package

How can I build the sick_tim package (http://github.com/uos/sick_tim/tree/groovy)
I cloned the repository into the ~/catkin_ws/src/ folder.
cd ~/catkin_ws/delvel
source setup.*sh
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

ive (so far) never seen/done source setup.*sh. Can you try to take out the asterisk? Also, i would recommend adding source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh into your .bashrc so you dont have to source your terminal enviornment for every new terminal you open.
