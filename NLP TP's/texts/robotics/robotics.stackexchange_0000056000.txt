Q:

How do I mark pip-installed dependencies as satisfied?

I've been trying to get ROS Hydro to run on Arch Linux, which uses Python 3 by default, and pacman for package management.
I've fixed a few Python 2/3 issues with rosdep, rospkg, etc, which I installed via pip.  I've reached the step of running rosdep for the catkin workspace. My command is:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
This gives me a bunch of errors like:
rqt_publisher: No definition of [python-rospkg] for OS [arch]
rqt_top: No definition of [python-psutil] for OS [arch]
pcl_ros: No definition of [libpcl-all] for OS [arch]
rosclean: No definition of [python-rospkg] for OS [arch]
smach_ros: No definition of [python-rosdep] for OS [arch]
...
Looking at the arch dependencies, there doesn't appear to be some packages defined for Arch:
github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/python.yaml
Since I didn't install using pacman (which is set up as the Arch package manager), what's the best way to tell rosdep that I've satisfied dependencies with pip?

Use the --skip-keys option
