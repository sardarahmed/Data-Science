Q:

Drop shadow not according to lightsources

I'm working with Apriltags in Gazebo and I'm having some lighting issues, the shadows don't respect the light source... or I'm just very noob, most likely.
Is currently selected the sun, as you see the cube drops the shadow in the wrong direction and there is no other light in the world :(

A:

Besides a light's pose, they also have a direction property. Here's where it is defined for the sun.
Unfortunately, the direction is not reflected in the 3D green lines, nor it is displayed in the world tree. Basically, as a new user, you had no way of knowing it ;)

Hoo, I see... I assumed that the direction would have been derived from the position of the object in the scene, thank you ^_^

The position of a directional light is not important, just its orientation. The position of a point light for example would matter.
