Q:

Twist message coordinate system convention

Trying to know what kind of coordinate system is using in twist message[1] (angular velocities) is not clear to us what does "free space" refers to.
¿Is it refering to EULER ZYX convention? ¿Or Fixed Frame?
In the second case, we can create a Quaterion[2] from EULER ZYX, and we would be interested to know if there is any method to extract the Fixed Frame coordinates from this quaternion.
Thanks a lot.

A:

To answer your direct question.  Velocities are instantaneous and therefore there is no such thing as Euler notation vs fixed frame notation.  Also note that quaternions represent orientations and are not appropriate for velocities.
You can convert between all the different conventions, Euler***, Fixed axis etc.  You will also find that EulerZYX(YPR) and FixedXYZ(RPY) is conveniently the same three components.

"Velocities are instantaneous" is the key concept here to understand that the coordinate system has nothing to do in this case. Crystal clear now. Thanks a lot.
