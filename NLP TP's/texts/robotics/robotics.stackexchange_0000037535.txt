Q:

NAO error: No module named yaml

So, I am trying to make ROS run on the NAO.  I have followed the wiki for Nao-Cross-Compiling, and I get everything to show up on the robot as stated in the wiki.  However, when I go to run roscore, just to see if it will work, I get the following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File
"/media/external/ros/electric/ros/bin/roscore",
line 34, in 
from ros import roslaunch   File "/media/external/ros/electric/ros/core/roslib/src/ros/init.py",
line 57, in getattr
return import(name)   File "/media/external/ros/electric/ros_comm/tools/roslaunch/src/roslaunch/init.py",
line 43, in 
import roslaunch.param_dump   File "/media/external/ros/electric/ros_comm/tools/roslaunch/src/roslaunch/param_dump.py",
line 43, in 
import yaml ImportError: No module named yaml

The PYTHONPATH for my setup.sh file looks like this:

PYTHONPATH=/media/external/python:/media/external/ros/electric/ros/core/roslib/src:$PYTHONPATH

The /media/external/python folder contains the yaml folder.
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
[edit] OS is Ubuntu 10.04 and nao sdk and toolchain are 1.10.44

A:

You're likely missing the python-yaml package on your system. It's a core system dependency when installing from source instructions

Whenever I run the setup: sudo apt-get install build-essential python-yaml cmake subversion wget python-setuptools mercurial git-core, it tells me that pyton-yamal is already the newest version
