Q:

YAML / RosLaunch debug suggestion

For some complicated Roslaunch setups, it can be tough to figure out where a parameter came from.  I've added the following line to each YAML file and it helps me tremendously.  The tag is "source" and the value is the YAML file name:
For example in arm.yaml:
source: arm.yaml
When ROSLaunch executes, you'll see the parameters print out something like this and you can immediately tell where the params came from.

/arbotix/joints/gripper_joint/max_angle: 0
/arbotix/joints/gripper_joint/max_speed: 50
/arbotix/source: arm.yaml
/arbotix/write_rate: 25

Does anyone see a downside to this or better approach?

A:

I'd suggest bringing this up with the roslaunch SIG, where it can be discussed in detail. It may be possible to build a feature like this into roslaunch - a few other additions have been made recently to make launch files easier to understand and debug.
