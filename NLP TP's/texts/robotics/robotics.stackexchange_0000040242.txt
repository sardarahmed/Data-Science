Q:

Failed to apply efforts to joints in gazebo on ros fuerte

Hi all,
I follow this tutorial using Fuerte, but the link does not rotate after
$rosservice call gazebo/apply_joint_effort '{joint_name: link_joint, effort: 0.01, start_time: 10000000000, duration: 1000000000}'
instead I get
ERROR: transport error completing service call: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details
I have launched
$ roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
on ROS Fuerte, Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit.
Where could I see sender's logs as suggested by the error msgs above?
Is there another way (how) to apply effort to joints in gazebo in Fuerte?
I note that the tutorial I follow was written for C-Turtle.

A:

The basic problem is that there was a bug in my electric-fuerte migration, fixed in the following patch, to be released with 1.6.8.
