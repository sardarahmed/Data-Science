Q:

Is necessary openCR for a three omni-wheel robot

Hi there,
I want to ask if it's worth it to program the robot without openCR for things like odometry, movement, imu, etc?

A:

you do not need the openCR but if you like to drive fast, or realy precise then you need a peace of hardware with an rtos (any bigger mcu) or you program it barematel.
you may look at https://micro-ros.github.io/ to have somethink like ros inside of the mcu.
then it depend witch kind of motor controller you use. if it is a good one you need les realtime

The robot is in an indoor and stable environment, it doesn't need to move really quick (approx 0.5 m/s) and its using three dynamixels and two 2D lidars.
