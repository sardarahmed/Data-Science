Q:

Does Gazebo 11 go with both ROS Melodic and Neotic?

Just to clarify, is it true that Gazebo 11 will be possible to be used with both ROS melodic (Ubuntu Bionic) and ROS Neotic (I assume Ubuntu Focal)?

A:

Yes, that's the plan. Gazebo 11 will be the official version for Noetic and Foxy, and it will also be supported with Melodic.

Is there a github ticket we can follow for release of ros_gazebo_pkgs for Foxy?
