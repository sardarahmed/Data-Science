Q:

terminate gazebo process in a c++ or python program

HI,
Does anyone know how to terminate gazebo process in a program? Is there a function like gazebo::destroy() or something like that to kill all gazebo process instead of pressing ctrl+c in the terminal that gazebo is started?
Thanks
Cherry

From a terminal, you can use killall gazebo or killall gzserver. If you want to use python, you could adapt the code from the following:
