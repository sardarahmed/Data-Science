Q:

Set model velocity via msgs in Gazebo 6

I need to move a model smoothly from keyboard. For this I need to set (maybe, learn) velocity of a model via messages.
In Messages API I found only static pose arguments. In a few places on the internet I saw some comments about "geometrymsgs/Twist" topic, but they look outdated as in Gazebo 6 there isn't anything similar.
So how Can I do this without any plugins, using just messages?
Thanks for the feedback!

A:

You can apply a wrench to a link using a topic with the following format:
~/WORLD_NAME/MODEL_NAME/LINK_NAME/wrench
Replace WORLD_NAME with the name of the world (usually default)
Replace MODEL_NAME with the name of the model.
Replace LINK_NAME with the name of the link on which to apply the force.

Thanks, it worked!
Now maybe you know where I can publish the WrenchStamped messages, it would be much more effective? ".../wrench_stamped" didn't work.
And how to stop the movement, because applying the same force backwards seems irrational?
And, optionally, how to learn/limit the velocity of the model?

I have been giving you advice based on the ApplyForceTorque widget. You might be better served looking at that code for examples.

From the file I learned that the values of Wrench can be in the thousands, unlike joints force in my previous experience, Now It works! Thank you again!
