Q:

Which motors are used in boston spot robot

I want to know which motors or smart servos are used in boston dynamics spot robot. Where can i read its spicification and is it possible to buy the motor? 

A:

Most of Boston Dynamics' robots are hydraulic driven including this one.  I believe it is mostly composed of off-the shelf hydraulic components, but they are very expensive.
