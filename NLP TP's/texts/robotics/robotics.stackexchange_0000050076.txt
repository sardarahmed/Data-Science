Q:

Errors Using yaml-cpp Library in ROS

Hi guys, I'm using ROS Fuerte and trying to use yaml parsing in my program. I have a "include <yaml-cpp/yaml.h>" in my code but I am still getting errors. According to the ROS wiki, I should not need to change my CMakelists.txt or manifest.xml to use it but I still get errors like :

/home/aramus/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/image_test/src/image_test.cpp:54: undefined reference to YAML::Node::Node()'
/home/aramus/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/image_test/src/image_test.cpp:92: undefined reference to YAML::Node::~Node()'
/home/aramus/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/image_test/src/image_test.cpp:92: undefined reference to YAML::Parser::~Parser()'
/home/aramus/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/image_test/src/image_test.cpp:92: undefined reference to YAML::Node::~Node()'
/home/aramus/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/image_test/src/image_test.cpp:92: undefined reference to YAML::Parser::~Parser()'
/home/aramus/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/image_test/src/image_test.cpp:92: undefined reference to YAML::Node::~Node()'
/home/aramus/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/image_test/src/image_test.cpp:92: undefined reference to YAML::Parser::~Parser()'

Any help on how to fix this would be great. Thanks!
EDIT:
I fixed it by adding
rosbuild_add_executable(image_test src/image_test.cpp)
target_link_library(${PROJECT_NAME} yaml-cpp)
I originally had the two switched around but order matters a lot!

Please include your CMakeLists.txt file and manifest.txt .

Can you include the ROS wiki link that specified that you shouldn't need to change your CMakeLists.txt or manifest.xml to use yaml-cpp?

A:

It looks like you didn't link your node against the yaml-cpp library. See the documentation for how to do that in Electric and newer.
In a nutshell you probably need to add something like:
target_link_libraries(image_test yaml-cpp) to your CMakeLists.txt .
