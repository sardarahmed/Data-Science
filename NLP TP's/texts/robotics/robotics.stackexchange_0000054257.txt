Q:

hydro pr2 gazebo

I was using ros-fuerte and ros-groovy before. I was using the PR2 robot. Now that I want to make the robot appear under ros-hydro but I'm having some troubles.
The first command I was using to load the gazebo environment
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch

And now in hydro is:
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch 

Gazebo is loading and working fine. Next is to load the robot, I was using:
 roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch

I've looked for the pr2.launch file and now it's in /opt/ros/hydro/share/pr2_bringup/pr2.launch so the command for ros-hydro should be
 roslaunch pr2_bringup pr2.launch

but it's not working. Any ideas?

A:

The PR2 simulator is not yet supported on Hydro, and has not been released.
When it is released, that proper startup command will be:
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch

Has this been already released? I could not find any debian package sounding like pr2_gazebo. If this is still up for release: Any guesstimated time for release? Is it possible to checkout the current devel branch of pr2_gazebo and give it a try?

I tried last week, it's not released yet. I have no idea when it's going to be released. But it's already a long time since hydro came out.

Basically, it seems there are quite some changes needed to have this running in Hydro. However, I have a feeling it will happen at some point in the future. See here for a discussion:

Dear all, do you have any news about the update of the PR2 simulator to be compatible with Hydro? I just write here not to open a new thread just for this question.

With pr2_simulator from github (branch hydro-devel), it works ok for me (on some machines). Btw, when there will be indigo branch? ;)
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-03-26:
I have no estimate on when there will be a release; there are still a number of unresolved issues in the hydro-devel branch. Since there are minimal changes between hydro and indigo, I expect that the hydro-devel branch will work on indigo.
