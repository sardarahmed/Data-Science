Q:

Synchronous communication with gazebo

Hi,
I am trying to implement a robot controller using ros + gazebo - So, what I want it to tell gazebo a particular command and then gazebo should return the state after 1 second. And after that it should pause itself.Now, I do some processing and again give a command - and it should again run for only 1 second.
I need my actions to be used for equal amounts of time.

A:

To get that level of control of gazebo's flow you will need to write a plugin for gazebo. I suggest you ask for help on http://answers.gazebosim.org
