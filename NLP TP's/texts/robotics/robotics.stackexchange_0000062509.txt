Q:

Using roscpp in external software

I would like to link to roscpp in an external software such to communicate with the ROS system running on my robot.
The scope is to use my Qt5 GUI to control and configure the robot on different systems (Windows, Linux, Android...).
Is there a guide or examples about this process?
Thank you
Walter

A:

You might also want to look into rqt and write a plugin for it to implement your specific UI.
One of the advantages is that your tool can then be used together with other plugins in a unified interface.

Hi Dirk,
I knew about rqt, is it yet based on Qt4.8?
However I do not think that I can use rqt on different platforms... what I'm searching for is a way to "subscribe" and to "publish" in a "not rosnode", nominally to insert a "node" inside a pre-existing application.

rqt supports PyQt as well as PySide. For the second one only Qt 4.x support is available.

The C++ client library of ROS is structured in a way that it allows it to be used easily within any other code. Just use the API as described in the normal tutorials.
