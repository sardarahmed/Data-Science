Q:

Conversion of a jpg or png image to a world file in gazebo

Let's say I have an image of the plan of a building. I want the same map as a 3d world in the gazebo. The plan only consists of walls and I want all the walls in my gazebo model. I know there are API's to build the same thing but working with those API might take a lot of time. So, I`m interested to know if there is an easy workaround for this problem

A:

In my case, I had a binary image with black cells representing walls. So, I was able to insert walls(or cuboids) in blender and generate a dae file.
