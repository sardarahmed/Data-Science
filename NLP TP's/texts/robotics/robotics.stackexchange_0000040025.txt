Q:

Failed to find rosdep joystick for package teleop_base on OS

Hi, all,
I was trying to follow the tutorial on simulating one robot using stage(link text), when I run "rosmake teleop_base", it pop up the following errors:
Failed to find rosdep joystick for package teleop_base on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
[ rosmake ] rosdep check failed to find system dependencies: joystick
I tried to find the joystick dependency on ROS website, but I could not find it.
Can any one give a solution to this problem? Thanks.

A:

Since you're using Ubuntu, you should use the binary packages, rather than installing from source. sudo apt-get install ros-electric-simulator-stage ros-electric-joystick-drivers I think should install everything you need.
