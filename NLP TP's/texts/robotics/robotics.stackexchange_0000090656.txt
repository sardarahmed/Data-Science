A:

Afaik (and afaict) the motoman_driver package can both be built and used under Melodic.
I've just compile-tested that in a Melodic docker container.

with kinetic version of Moveit!;

I'm not sure how MoveIt factors into this, but seeing as none of the action interfaces have changed, I would say it should work.
