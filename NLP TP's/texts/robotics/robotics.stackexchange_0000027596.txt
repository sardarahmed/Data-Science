Q:

How do I properly use the gazebo API?

Say I want to rotate a joint at a certain velocity. So I browse through the API reference pages and reach here.
I can't seem to find any reference to the term 'velocity'. Is it linear velocity or angular velocity? Also what is it's unit? Where do I find information about it?

Nobody can answer this simple question?

Since ODE is the default physic engine for gazebo, you might find some answers here:

A:

It depends on the joint type. Velocity will be linear for prismatic joints and angular for revolute joints.
Gazebo uses SI units, so linear velocity is in m/s and angular velocity in rad/s.
