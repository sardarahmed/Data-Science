Q:

ambiguous use of header file

Hi,
I want to use a package::header as usual like this:
void callbackBB(package_msgs::header msgs_x)
{
}

but the compiler indicates the headerfile is ambiguous and should be used like
header()

or
header(const package_msgs::header<#0> &)

Does this mean this header can't be instantiated ? The writer doesn't give support so can't ask. Thanks.
Code sample:
void  callback_BB_Twist(amigo_msgs::arm_links msgs_ls_t)

Error by Eclipse
Description
'amigo_msgs::arm_links' is ambiguous '
Candidates are:
arm_links()
arm_links(const amigo_msgs::arm_links<#0> &)

Compiler error:
error: ‘amigo_msgs::arm_links’ is not a type

A full minimal example:
#include "amigo_msgs/arm_links.h"
class ImageP
{
    void callbackBB(amigo_msgs::armlinks msgs_x)
    {
    }
    ImageP(ros::nodehandle* n)
    {
         ls_sub = n->subscribe("<topic>", &ImageP::callbackBB, this);
    }
    void run()
    {
    }
};
int main()
{
    ros::init(argc,argv,"imagedo");
    ros::Rate loop_rate(30);
    while(ros::ok())
    {
        imagep.run();
        ros::spinOnce();
        loop_rate.sleep;
     }
}

That doesn't make much sense. Can you include the code sample you're trying to compile and the exact compiler output?

I edited the question. Hope you can make some sense out of it.
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-06-11:
Your include #include "amigo_msgs::arm_links" doesn't look right at all. Is that a typo?
Comment by hvn on 2014-06-12:
Yes, that was a typo. I corrected it.

A:

I'm not sure what Eclipse is trying to tell you. I suspect it is confused.
The underlying error here seems to be that amigo_msgs::arm_links isn't a type. Perhaps you forgot to include the appropriate header file?

No, I didn't forget to include the header file. That's why it's confusing me as well.

Please give a minimal, but complete example of what you are trying to compile.

How can I post that best ?

Edit you original question to provide further information.
