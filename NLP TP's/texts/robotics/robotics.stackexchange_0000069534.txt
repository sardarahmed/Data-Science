sorry,there're some mistakes with my Firefox.I can't upload the question (However, it has already uploaded) So ,the question uploaded like repost.

A:

You are missing the gstreamer 0.10 element gconfaudiosrc, try installing it. Depending on your Linux Distribution it is named something like gstreamer0.10-gconf.
