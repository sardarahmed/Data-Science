Q:

What is the package route between Subscriber and Publisher in a multi-machine ROS network?

Assuming to have a multi-machine ROS network where there is a Master running on a remote server, and both the Subscriber and the Publisher in a local network; does the packets exchanged between the Subscriber and the Publisher need to reach the remote server?

No.
See wiki/ROS/Concepts (ROS Computation Graph Level section), and wiki/Master.
