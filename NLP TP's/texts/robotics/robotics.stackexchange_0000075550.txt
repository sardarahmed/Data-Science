Q:

How to create a caster wheel (Urdf model)

I have built a 2 wheel robot and I have been trying for hours to put a correct caster wheel on it. I followed the logic of this code in which a sphere with a fixed joint is used and I managed to make it work (or I thought so) until I commanded my robot to move. The movement was totally wrong. With the fixed joint sphere, the robot was bumping like crazy. Is there another way to create a caster wheel ?
Thanks for answering and for your time in advance.

A:

I fixed the bumping of the robot by increasing the weight of the base_link. Now the movement seems smooth.

Adding mass in base_link has solved my problem of bumping or jerky motion of robot.
Thank you.
