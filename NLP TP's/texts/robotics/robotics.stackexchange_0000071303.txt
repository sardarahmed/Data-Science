Q:

TurtleBot ROS - How to move to specific angle (using Twist)

Hi,
I'm trying to set a specific angle for the robot.
I'm using simple python script I found here: http://answers.ros.org/question/203575/kobuki-unpredictability/
I am able to get IMU messages and get the current angle (in degree),  by listening to "/mobile_base/sensors/imu_data", and take the yaw from data.orientation,
and also to make the robot 'twist' by setting move_cmd.angular.z.
But how can I tell the robot to go to exact angle, without an ugly loop that trying to get near my desired angle?
Thanks!

A:

What do you want is a controller. If the TurtleBot doesn't come with one you should implement it. As you say the easiest way to do it is to make a node that listens for desired poses and sends a twist to the robot. The most straightforward is the porportional control in which the speed is proportional to the desired angle. Of course there are other options but I don't see why is this ugly.
