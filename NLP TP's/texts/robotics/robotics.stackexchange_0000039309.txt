Q:

creating eclipse Project, "C/C++ Make Project" missing

I followed the instructions on the following page,  http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs . I am having problem with Step 4, there isn't any option "C/C++ Make Project" in project properties, have repeated the steps again and again but couldn't identify the problem.

Did you make sure to install the version of Eclipse for C/C++ development?

A:

I believe, there are packages which only builds a library, no executables. If you are is on eclipse, after doing make eclipse-project, import it as a " existing project into workspace". You can find this option under 'General'. This always works for me.
