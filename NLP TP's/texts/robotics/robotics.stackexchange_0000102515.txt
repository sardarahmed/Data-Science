Q:

\rviz_visual_tools not shown in MarkerArray Topic's

I'm using ros2 humble. I'm working on the MoveIt 2 tutorial.
After creating the Sourcecode i have to add the RvizVisualToolsGui and the MarkerArray.
In the MarkerArray i have to change the topic to \rviz_visual_tools.
Unfortunately it dosen't show this topic in the drop down menu.
I can just choose between \visualization_marker_array, \display_cost_source and \display_contacts.
After doing the step by step tutorial i just copied the the whole sourcecode but there is still the same problem.
How can i solve this?

A:

I tried to type the Topic in manually. (without using the dropdown menu)
This worked for me.
