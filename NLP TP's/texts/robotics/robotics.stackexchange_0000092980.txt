Q:

Is my ROS properly installed?

I've just installed melodic on OSX and wonder if I've done it right as I've had to make a few changes. I've tried running rosversion ros, but I get Cannot locate [ros]. The command source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash inside /opt/ros/melodic gives no result. The command roscore gives the following:

started roslaunch server
http://mun-iMac.local:53241/ ros_comm
version 1.14.3
SUMMARY
========
PARAMETERS  * /rosdistro: melodic  *
/rosversion: 1.14.3

process[rosout-1]: started with pid
[11223] started core service [/rosout]

Does anyone know if it's properly installed?

A:

Why should it not be installed correctly? You can easily try to start a node, such as turtlesim and see if it works (rostopic echo /topicname -> to see if current data are in the topic)

I've had to change quite a few things to get it running on OSX, so I wasn't quite sure. All good now! Thanks
