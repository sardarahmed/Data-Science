Q:

rosmsg show Num error

I'm following the ROS Tutorial ''Creating a ROS msg and srv'' and meet a problem.
When I type
$ rosmsg show Num

It shows
Unable to load msg [beginner_tutorials/Num]: /home/xxx/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg/Num.msg: Invalid declaration: int 64 num

can anybody explain this error? thanks in advance

A:

Looks like you have an extra space in your Num.msg message definition. It should be int64 num not int 64 num.
