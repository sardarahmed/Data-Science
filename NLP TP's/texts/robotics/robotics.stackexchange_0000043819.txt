Q:

obstacle avoidance with navigation stack

Hi,
I'm running the navigation stack and using rviz 2DNav to send goal to my robot but it don't avoid obstacles.
I'm sure thta it detects them because they're displayed when I use the grid cells display with the obstacles and inflated obstacles topic.
What could be the problem?

I've noticed that, using 2DNav from rviz, the /goal topic published by rviz is subscribed by the proxy node and not by the move_base node, which is the one that published on /cmd_vel. Could this be an error?

A:

With move_base you can visualize local or global costmap.
If you are seeing the global one, it comes only from you map, not from your sensors.
If you cannot see the local costmap obstacles, then your problem may be with the configurations of your yaml files.
cheers

I can see the local costmap obstacles, to do that i'm using two grid cell display setting each topic to /move_base/local_costmap/obstacles and /move_base/local_costmap/inflated_obstacles. But also if I can see the obstacles the robot doesn't avoid them. I can't figure why.
