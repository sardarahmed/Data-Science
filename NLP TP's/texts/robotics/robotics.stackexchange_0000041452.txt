Q:

Filling geometry_msgs/Pose2D[] message

Hello,
i am failing to fill a ros message and google serves me no good.
The message is of the following format
Header header
string child_frame_id
geometry_msgs/Pose2D[] pose

Maybe i lack the needes C++ skills, but i just dont understand the automatic created class for this message. How do i fill Pose2D elements to a new message?
I tried something like the following without success:
pedestrianSim::pedestrians msg;
geometry_msgs::Pose2D_ singlePos;
singlePos.x = x;
singlePos.y = y;
singlePos.theta = omega;
msg.pose.push_back( singlePos );

Thank you for your help!
Regards,
Manuel

A:

It would help to see your error messages.
Looking at what information you did provide, I suggest leaving off the trailing '_' from the message type name:
geometry_msgs::Pose2D singlePos;
