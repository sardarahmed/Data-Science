Q:

How to remap a topic in rviz that is issued by plugin

How do I remap a topic in rqt that is issued by rviz plugin. I am trying to remap topic initialpose to myinitialpose. But when I use the set pose from the rviz menu it still publishes on the old topic.

A:

While I still question how to do this, my immediate concern on remapping initialpose can be done via the rivz properties panel.
