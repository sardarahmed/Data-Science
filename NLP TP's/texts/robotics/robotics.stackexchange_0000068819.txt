Q:

ueye_cam calibration and parameters

I'm trying to use ueye_cam package to control two uEye cameras: a UI122xSE-C and a UI223xSE-C. I've installed the IDS driver and I can use it to open both cameras. I'm trying to use rgb8.launch to control the UI122xSE camera first. However, I get the following warning whenever I run this launch with that camera:

How can I get the parameters? How can I calibrate the camera?
EDIT: I also have another question regarding the control of both cameras at the same time. Do I need just to modify rgb8.launch adding another ueye_cam_nodelet (like ueye_cam_nodelet2) with another camera_name (like camera2)?

A:

Re - parameters:  which parameters do you want to get? If you are referring to the warning about MONO8: http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure
Re - calibration: http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration
Re - multiple uEye cameras: if you want them to operate independently, then yes you need to duplicate the launch file, and change the node name, camera namespace, and camera ID. If you want to synchronize the exposure of both cameras, see: http://wiki.ros.org/ueye_cam#Camera_Synchronization
