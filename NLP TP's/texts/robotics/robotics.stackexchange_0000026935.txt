And when try to:
roscreate-pkg drcsim_joint_commands_tutorial roscpp trajectory_msgs osrf_msgs

@scpeters,

A:

osrf_msgs is a ros package distributed in the osrf-common debian on packages.osrfoundation.org. If you installed drcsim using apt-get (according to the installation instructions), then the package should be on your system. Use the following command to search for it:

$ dpkg -l | grep osrf

as a matter of fact I have this package
ii  osrf-common                                  1.1.0-2~precise                                     Software and messages used in multiple OSRF projects

However when try to upgrading to DRCsim have a problem with this package
 drcsim-groovy : Depende: osrf-common-groovy pero no va a instalarse
                         Depende: sandia-hand-groovy pero no va a instalarse

I used:
  $ sudo apt-get -f install drcsim-groovy
