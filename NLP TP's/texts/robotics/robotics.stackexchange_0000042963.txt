Q:

How to solve 'ImportError: No module named door_msgs.msg'?

I followed PR2 Opens a Door tutorial.
when I run
  hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/doors/hg
  svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/motion_planning_common/trunk/mapping_msgs
  svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/motion_planning_common/trunk/geometric_shapes_msgs
  
  export ROBOT=sim
  roslaunch pr2_doors_gazebo_demo pr2_doors_demo.launch
  rosrun pr2_doors_executive trigger_opendoor.py

It says:
  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/test$ rosrun pr2_doors_executive trigger_opendoor.py
  Traceback (most recent call last):

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

Did you execute
rosmake pr2_doors_executive

When you are installing packages from source, you need to rosmake them.

I can run it. And it shows:Waiting for open door action server
Sending goal to open door action server.
But why pr2 doesn't move? I can't see PR2 do anything.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-08-06:
As @dornhege pointed out already, the code is written for cturtle and is probably unmaintained. I wouldn't expect it to work in electric.
Comment by sam on 2012-08-06:
Sure,you're right. But I think if I know how tofix it maybe I can learn more ROS. Or should I post on another question?
Comment by dornhege on 2012-08-06:
If you do this to learn more, you'll need to debug what is going on, i.e. understand how it's supposed to work and then see where it hangs. But for learning how things in ROS work, I'd suggest taking something more recent as things might have changed drastically.

Where to start to figure out? And how to make sure what I need? Thank you~

Reading source code is always a good starting point. Use rxgraph, rostopic info, rostopic list, rosnode info and rosnode list to find out which nodes are connected/unconnected. Find out why the unconnected nodes are not connected and fix that by starting the missing nodes. And read source code :)
