Q:

How to set up rosjava classpath?

I'm trying to build a downloaded rosjava package for using april tags.  I have installed the deb install of ros-hydro-rosjava.  However, when I run catkin_create_rosjava_pkg, I get the following error:
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'april'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':classpath'.
   > Could not find any version that matches org.ros.rosjava_bootstrap:gradle_plugins:[0.1,0.2).
     Required by:
         :april:unspecified

What have I failed to set up?  is catkin_create_rosjava_pkg even the right thing to be running here?
Thanks.

What are the april tags? Are you downloading all rosjava sources into a source workspace with your project, or using the debs?

Thank you for the responses. Daniel, APRIL Tags can be found here: http://april.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/AprilTags
Time ran out on getting this to work. I never did figure out how to get the rosjava classpaths set up correctly, even with the deb install, but it's no longer so relevant.

Ok. Apologies for not getting back to you  more quickly, it looks like a trivial issue related to setting up your workspace.

A:

Yeah, almost certainly it's something silly.  Thanks, anyway.
