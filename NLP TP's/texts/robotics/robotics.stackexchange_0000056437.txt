Q:

tf_static and nodelet_manager unconnected for my Kinects

I recently learned about the roswtf tool and have been trying to use it to determine where some things are going wrong.  When I use roswtf after launching my Kinects in separate terminals like so:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch camera:=kinect_1 device_id:=1@0 
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch camera:=kinect_2 device_id:=2@0 
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch camera:=kinect_3 device_id:=3@0 

I receive this error:
WARNING The following node subscriptions are unconnected:
 * /kinect_2/kinect_2_nodelet_manager:
   * /tf_static
 * /kinect_1/kinect_1_nodelet_manager:
   * /tf_static
 * /kinect_3/kinect_3_nodelet_manager:
   * /tf_static

Is this anything to be concerned about? I can access all of my camera streams still- rbg, disparity, and depth.  What exactly does this error mean?  I've tried googling and looking on here and haven't seen this error. I'm using model #1473 Kinects and Hydro.
And to add to my confusion, this is the rqt_graph: http://imgur.com/uFdxehH (I can't insert the picture it's too big)
It looks like they're connected to me.

did you find any solution?

A:

This is old, but I just had to find that out too.
Most probably, you are using a TransformListener. The reason tf_static is reported as unconnected is that it automatically subscribes to both tf and tf_static (see source). Now if you only use tf in your system (which is perfectly legal afaik), tf_static will not be connected.

+1. Btw, I found this warning confusing, so filed a ticket.
