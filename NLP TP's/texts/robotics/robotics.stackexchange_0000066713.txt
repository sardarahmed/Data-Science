Q:

Warning with ompl

Hello,
I have updated my ros packages, now when I use catkin_make or run certain nodes, I obtain:
WARNING: Package "ompl" does not follow the version conventions. It should not contain leading zeros (unless the number is 0).

There is a way to fix this warning?

A:

That warning is really just a warning, and has no influence on the correct functioning of OMPL, MoveIt or any package/node making use of it.
See also @isucan's answer in Package "ompl" does not follow the version conventions:

For historical reasons, the convention for the OMPL version is non-standard: https://github.com/ros-gbp/ompl-release/blob/master/read_this_before_releasing

This was done so that we have unique version numbers and can release OMPL for ROS outside of the regular OMPL release cycle. In the meantime things have stabilized much more, so I think we could start adopting a standard version. That said, we should probably switch to the debian package for OMPL directly (although, even for indigo, that is a bit old now).

Thanks! Like it says in the Answer of the link that you posted, "Try linking against ${OMPL_LIBRARIES} instead of ${ompl_LIBRARIES}" solved the problem.
