Q:

Problem with launching turtlebot_gazebo

I am running ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 13.04, with kernel 3.8.0-35-generic. My graphics card info: ATI Seymour [Radeon HD 6400M/7400M Series], and I am using the Radeon driver.
I get an error while trying to run the following command from the turtlebot_simulator tutorial:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_playground.launch
(I get a similar error while trying to run "roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch" also)
This is what I get in the terminal window:

Resolved the problem. The issue was with the graphics driver. Installing proprietary ATI drivers resolved it.

A:

Could you check this page ( http://answers.ros.org/question/65402/gazebo-fail-to-connect-to-master-in-30-seconds-it-does-not-run-from-the-very-first-time/ )? Probably this answer solves your problem. Because Error message says Failed to connect to master in 30 seconds. Your problem has a relationship with gzclient and gzserver. I think so.
