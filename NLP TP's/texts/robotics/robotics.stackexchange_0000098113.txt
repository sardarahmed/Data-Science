Q:

OGRE EXCEPTION(7:InternalErrorException): Vertex Buffer: Out of memory

I am trying to broadcast multiple tf frames of various joints obtained via camera. If the broadcaster frames exceed 10, i am receiving the following error from RViz.
I am followed the standard ROS tf python tutorials.
rviz

that doesn't look like something I'd expect.
Are you doing this on purpose?

Even when I launch RViz, I get the same openGL version 0 issue. I did a little bit of digging and found this link! maybe it's just that certain hardware cannot accelerate the graphics?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2021-01-24:
What OS are you using? Are you running this in a Virtual Machine, or on Windows 10 WSL perhaps?

A:

Try the solution in this link, this solution will not be working for everyone as mentioned in that link. But give it a try though and let me know ! This might accelerate your hardware!

LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE completely disables acceleration / use of hw, as it forces software rendering.
This is at best a work-around.
