Q:

About addStaticObservation function?

Hi ROS developers,
I can't find any documentation or comments concerning the function
void costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer::addStaticObservation  (   costmap_2d::Observation &   obs,
bool   marking,
bool   clearing
)
Can you tell me what's the role of this function ? is it to add a new obstacle to the costmap's obstacle layer ? and how and when can I use it ?
Waiting for your help.
Regards.

A:

This function primarily exists for testing purposes. For non-testing purposes, I would use the standard subscribers to add observations to your costmap.
