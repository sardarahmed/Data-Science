Q:

video stream in ros

i started to stream video using ros by using ssh to connect to the target system where i have attached the camera. I launched a gscam node there and it is working. then in the other system i exported ros_master_uri. When i rostopic list the nodes. I shows /gscam/image_raw publishing. But when i run rosrun image_view image_view image:=/gscam/image_raw the window opens but no video. I did try compressed transport also. Could you please help me?

A:

Did you export your ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME on the other machine also?
Otherwise could you post:
$env | grep ROS

And a image of rxgraph with all topics listed could solve the problem.
Is there something published on the topic?
rostopic hz /gscam/image_raw
