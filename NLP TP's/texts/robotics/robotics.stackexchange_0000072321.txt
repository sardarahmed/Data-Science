Q:

Problems with .bashrc

I installed ROS INDIGO in my system.
For environment set up I did the following
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

after I write
source ~/.bashrc

Now the following shows up in the terminal,
bash: /home/user_name/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/user_name/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/baban/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/user_name/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/user_name/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /home/baban/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory

I would like to know if there is any thing wrong during installation.

A:

I solved the issue by gedit ~/.bashrc. Then deleted all the source directories except the two recommended below,
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

source /home/[your username]/[catkin-workspace]/devel/setup.bash
