Q:

Robot position flashing rviz using rtabmap

When using rtabmap somehow my robot position starts to flash. It will flash extremely quick between several positions.
Also this impacts it drive ability.
This could be due to more locations being possible?
I am using an roomba with the create_autonomy package with an kinect on top of it.
It will reach a goal but will take a weird route to do so.
output ROSwtf

Found 2 error(s).

ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:

/move_base_node->/move_base_node (/move_base_node/global_costmap/footprint)
/move_base_node->/move_base_node (/move_base_node/local_costmap/footprint)

ERROR TF multiple authority contention:

node [/rtabmap/rtabmap] publishing transform [odom] with parent [map] already published by node [/slam_gmapping]
node [/slam_gmapping] publishing transform [odom] with parent [map] already published by node [/rtabmap/rtabmap]

EDIT: When disabling gmapping roswtf will not give me the error anymore. There is only one more problem that. When setting /rtabmap/grid_map as my map topic in the global costmap it will no longer react to any goals send to the robot.

Does roswtf show any problems?

edited main question with the errors

A:

Like @matlabbe said, it sounds like an issue with the TF tree.
There may be odometry issues if you are using a Roomba 700 series or later with create_autonomy. Please refer to this issue for a potential fix.

Hi that is actually my own issue :P It reduces the flashing but when traveling longer distance the flashing will increase.
