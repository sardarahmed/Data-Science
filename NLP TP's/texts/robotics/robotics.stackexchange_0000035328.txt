Q:

-msoft-float for beagleboard

Is it really need to use g++ flag
-msoft-float

for compile OpenCV on beagleboard (beagleboard xm)?

A:

EDIT I have checked again and it turns out that the BeagleBoard-xM has a Super-scalar ARM Cortex TM -A8 with floating point capabilities. So the -msoft-float flag should be unnecessary.

Old answer, Incorrect for BeagleBoard-xM, right for other ARM processors.
This flag tells gcc to use a (very slow) software implementation of floating point arithmetic. As the ARM processors don't have a floating point processor this flag becomes necessary. As far as I know the BeagleBoard-xM does not have a floating point co-processor.
Theoretically you can compile bits of OpenCV to use only integer arithmetic, but I don't know how many routines will be available.
So the short answer is "yes, unless you can strip away all the floating point arithmentic from OpenCV".

i see. Thanks!

They have the same processor (ARM Cortex-A8 superscalar) with different clock speeds, so they are both capable of floating point arithmetic.

So BeagleBoard-xM has floating poit co-processor, but BeagleBoard doesnt?

Thanks a lot!
