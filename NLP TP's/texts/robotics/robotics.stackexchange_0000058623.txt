Q:

Gazebo - Unable to find texture

Hello guys,
I made my 3D model by Sketchup and I exported collada file (final.dae). Today I tried to import this .dae file to gazebo (by my_mesh.world file) and when gazebo starts, on shell it gives me this error a lot of times:
Error [Material.cc:93] Unable to find texture [final/texturename.jpg] in path[/home/myusername/Desktop/gazebo]
My question is: every time I make a .dae file and I want to import on gazebo (for example), always I have to paste into directory of my gazebo ALL .jpg file of texture??? Is not .dae file sufficient? How can I resolve?
Thnx

A:

Ehm I resolved... I didn't see that Sketchup, when I exported .dae file, I didn't see that Sketchup makes also a folder with textures... Pardon xD
