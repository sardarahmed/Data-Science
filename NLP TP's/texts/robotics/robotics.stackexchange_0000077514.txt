Q:

problem in creating ROS Workspace

Hi all...
I've installed Ubuntu 16 Xenial and also ROS Kinetic.
I tried to run simulation with Gazebo.
when I executed catkin_make in creating ROS workspace, I found this following error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "driver_base" with
any of the following names:
  driver_baseConfig.cmake
  driver_base-config.cmake

and this one:
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/seano/simulation/ros_catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
See also "/home/seano/simulation/ros_catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log".
Makefile:290: recipe for target 'cmake_check_build_system' failed
make: [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

any idea..??
thanks..

A:

The error basically tells you that you don't have the driver_base package on your system. Whatever you are trying to catkin_make needs that package, and so Catkin (really CMake) can't continue.
Looking at wiki/driver_base, it looks like that package hasn't been released into Kinetic. And based on the package's description, it looks like that may not happen ever:

A framework for writing drivers that helps with runtime reconfiguration, diagnostics and self-test. This package is deprecated.

Maintainer status: end-of-life (Will be released only as long as required for PR2 drivers (hokuyo_node, wge100_driver))

What package are you trying to build?
