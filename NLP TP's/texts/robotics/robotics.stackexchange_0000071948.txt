I saved a pcd file from rgbdslam Save > Save as Point Cloud ... and when I tried to Load > Open PCD files I get the following error:
 [ERROR] [1455205544.447237056]: Cloud has "flat" dimensions: 1 x 5305023

A:

Short answer: The saved cloud is the map, the load function loads individual measurements.
Details:
The load function takes a set of pcd files, each representing one sensor measurement and expects each to have the 2d raster layout of a depth image, e.g. 640x480.
The saved cloud is an aggregation of the point clouds in the map, transformed into a common coordinate frame (/map). Because of the aggregation, the raster layout is dropped and the cloud has "flat" dimensions.
The obvious next question is "how do I load a map into rgbdslam", e.g. to continue mapping. Unfortunately you can't, it's not implemented.
