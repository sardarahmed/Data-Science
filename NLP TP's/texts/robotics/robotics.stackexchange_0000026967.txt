Q:

show reference frames

Hello everybody,
can someone tell me how to show in gazebo the reference frames attached to the models and the world reference frame? It would save me from the headaches I am having .
Thank you!

A:

Unfortunately, not all the reference frames are viewable. In gazebo 2.2 and higher, if you select the View Center of Mass / Inertia from the View menu, then it will display pink boxes representing the size of a box of uniform density with equivalent mass properties, and green lines that represent the link frame. Also, you can View Joints to see axis frames for the joints. Please make a feature request on bitbucket if you need additional functionality.
