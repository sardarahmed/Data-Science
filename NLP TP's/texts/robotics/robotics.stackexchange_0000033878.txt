Q:

Is there any console output similar with ROS_INFO without "\n"?

I found that when I use ROS_INFO to output console message,it always output a line.
Is there any ROS output method only output the message I specify?
Thank you~

A:

Nothing I know about. ROS_INFO() and other ROS logging services send messages to a central logging facility where they are collected from many nodes. Sending incomplete messages does not make much sense in that environment.
You can accumulate a message string in your own code, waiting until a complete line is constructed before logging it. For that, the standard C++ or Python string operations are sufficient.
