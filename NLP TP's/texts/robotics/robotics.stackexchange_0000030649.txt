Q:

Build a controller from scratch

Hi everybody!
After making a "stable" URDF of the robot that I want to simulate and make some tests with it in Gazebo, I'm trying to build a controller for teleop with it. Searching in the web I only found manuals and references from the pr2_controller.
It is essential inherit and implement PR2 classes like pr2_controller_manager, pr2_controller_interface...? There is any generic driver base? Actuators are essential?
Can anyone put some order into this chaos and explain briefly the steps in this process?

Hi,
Work your way through the pr2_mechanism tutorials.  They describe how to implement and run a custom controller.
