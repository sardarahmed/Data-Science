Q:

What's the term for 2 Dimensional tracks similar to the ones used on 3D printers?

I'm trying to do some research on a project that I'd like to work on.  My problem is that I am doing a terrible job googling, because I don't know what this technology is called.

Once I know what it's called, I feel like finding systems I can buy, or build, will be much more simple.

A:

That is called a gantry robot.
