Q:

using fovis and freekinect

I can't find anywhere which tells me how to us fovis or viso2 with the freekinect driver. Freekinect runs and works (I've used image_view to see the various image messages it produces), but I can find no documentation or any information on how to point fovis/viso2 to the messages that are produced.

Can you please be more specific? I don't know what is a freekinect.
viso2 works only with stereo cameras, and fovis with stereo cameras or kinect.

I've added more stuff

A:

viso2 works only with mono or stereo cameras. If you want to use the depth information of your kinect, then viso2 is not for you.
On the other hand, fovis works with both stereo cameras or depth cameras. To use it with your freekinect, use the rectified topics

/rgb/image_rect (sensor_msgs/Image)
/depth_registered/image_rect (sensor_msgs/Image)

to publish/subscribe to your camera. Then open a dynamic reconfigure gui or a launchfile and play with the parameters until you get the results you expect.
Here you have all the parameters explained.
