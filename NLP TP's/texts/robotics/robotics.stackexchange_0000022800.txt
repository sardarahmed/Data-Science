Tips for designing an optical eight channel read head for a DIY rotary encoder

I'm thinking of using the gray code optical encoder disc design described at TeX Stack Exchange to sense the base rotation of a robot arm. Being able to vary the disc to suit the physical aspects of the particular situation is attractive.

I've subsequently been thinking about putting together a matching 8 track reading head. Probably using something like these miniature reflective IR optical sensors.

Can anyone point me towards good resources for figuring out a read head design? Any tips for avoiding interference between tracks?
At the moment I'm just thinking about mounting them as close together as I can on prototyping board and printing the tracks on the disc to be the same width as a single sensor.

A:

I ended up going with the linear photo sensor array idea suggested by @r-bryan, and selected a Pololu QTR-HD-09RC Reflectance Sensor Array: 9-Channel, 4mm Pitch, RC Output. I’ll update this answer with Tex code for printing a matching Gray code wheel when available.
I’ve initially chosen a digital output array. I’ve yet to read through the supplied Arduino library to check for  a non-blocking solution. I may switch to the analog version if this becomes an issue after testing.
