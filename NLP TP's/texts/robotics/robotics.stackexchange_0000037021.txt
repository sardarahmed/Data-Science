Q:

Transform from base_link to odom failed

If someone can shoot some wisdom my way I would be much obliged.
I have the gyro installed, showing up on dashboard, all green.
When I am driving around performing the mapping, I get the error in terminal from gmapping.

Transform from base_link to odom failed

The below is what I get from dashboard.

Node: /slam_gmapping Time:
1326381589.218725027 Severity: Error Location:
/tmp/buildd/ros-electric-slam-gmapping-1.2.4/debian/ros-electric-slam-gmapping/opt/ros/electric/stacks/slam_gmapping/gmapping/src/slam_gmapping.cpp:laserCallback:496
Published Topics: /rosout, /tf,
/slam_gmapping/entropy, /map,
/map_metadata

Thanks.

Is this a turtlebot or a turtlebot clone? What is the system load while running gmapping? Does this happen immediately, or only after gmapping has been running for a while?

It is a turtlebot clone. It doesn't happen immediately, say if I spent 15mins driving around a space mapping, I would get the error 4 or 5 times. It can then be seen that the position of the turtlebot jumps in Rviz. I suspect that the inconsistent odom values then play havoc on closing the loop.

From what it seems it looks like a problem with the tf. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36264864/second.bag

What are the specs on your computer? What is the system load (uptime, top) while getting this error?

A:

On a system that is slightly underpowered, you may see this error occasionally. As long as it's happening infrequently, perhaps only once every few minutes, you should be able to ignore it.
Alternatively, you could capture tf and scan data as a bag file and run gmapping offline, when other nodes aren't competing with it for CPU and memory. See: http://ros.org/wiki/slam_gmapping(2f)Tutorials(2f)MappingFromLoggedData.html
If you're seeing this more than once per second, it means that there's something wrong with your odometry source.
