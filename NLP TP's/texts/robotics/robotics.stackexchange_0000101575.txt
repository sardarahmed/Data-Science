Q:

Pausing/resuming a navigation task using Nav2 Python Simple Commander

Hello,
I am using the ROS2 Galactic and Nav2 stack with Python Simple Commander in a Gazebo simulation (Ubuntu 20.04).
How can I pause (and later resume) the robot's movement while navigating?
E.g. TB3 is moving along a planned path through an intersection.
I want to pause its movement using a kind of trigger, wait a few seconds, and then resume the previous navigating plan.
I checked Simple Commander API but I didn't find a similar command that could be used in a similar way that I would like.
I can try to work around this problem by saving the current position and the goal pose, then canceling the task with 'cancelTask()' + resuming the task with goToPose(), but maybe there is a better solution? Could you help me with some hints?

I think we clearly went through this in the ticket. You could definitely write a wrapper on some functions for an application to save info like pose / goal and have that be used to send to the main navigator APIs. But that's mostly just shifting code around.

Yes, chronologically that question was there first, only later did I fill out the feature request.
TL;DR; cancelTask() + goToPose() to the same position is the way to go.
