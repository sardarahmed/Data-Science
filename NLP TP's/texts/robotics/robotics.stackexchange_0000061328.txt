Q:

rqt_graph topic statistics not working

This is the documentation i'm following:
http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph#Topic_statistics
This feature is not working on my system. I can't find the reason why.

ROS Indigo
Ubuntu 14.04

Tested by creating some instances of the turtlesim package's executables.
Here's my result when using rqt_graph. You can see from the terminal window that the parameter is currently set to true

Please ignore the line under the terminal window.

As answered below, besides setting the parameter to true, one needs to launch topic monitor and tick every statistics that is desired.

Launch rqt
Plugins -> topics -> topic monitor

A:

You may need to set the parameter before launching the nodes you want to introspect. I am able to monitor the statistics between turtlesim and the robot steering rqt plugin on my machine running indigo:

Also, remember that you need to manually refresh the rqt Node Graph window using the refresh button.

Thank you, I think I was missing the ticks on Topic Monitor. The rqt_graph documentation led me to believe all statistics measurements would be active after setting the parameter to true. Enabling isn't the same as doing that, though.
