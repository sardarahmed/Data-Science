Q:

Problem on using rgbdslam with kinect connected remotely on the network

Hi everyone
I am trying to run rgbdslam on pc with kinect data captured with another laptop on network. Firstly i establish the network. Then i run roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch on the laptop which the kinect is conected to it. Then i roslaunch rgbdslam rgbdslam.launch on th PC. The laptop just capture the kinect data and send them on network to PC. But with no error there is no image on rgbdslam GUI and it doesn't work. I appreciate any help.

Do you receive the data on the PC? Can you check with e.g. rostopic hz /camera/depth_registered/sw_registered/image_rect_raw or by displaying with "image_view"

A:

Try increasing the value of subscriber queue size. You can also use rviz or rostopic to see whether any messages are coming in.
