Q:

The issue of Validating certificate from MIT CSAIL's svn

hello, I am very new to ROS and I am using the mit-ros-pkg and installing Kinect Demos for Electric (my ubuntu version 11.04 and ros Electric). There is one step to Validate certificate from MIT CSAIL's svn. When I run the code "svn list https://svn.csail.mit.edu". It says "svn: Repository moved temporarily to ‘https://svn.csail.mit.edu:1443/admin/admin.cgi’; Please relocate." Does that matter? Or I can just ignore it? I have tried to run the code " svn list https://svn.csail.mit.edu:1443/admin/admin.cgi" and then it said " Certification in the field:https://svn.csail.mit.edu:1443" and asked to input the "Client certificate file name". I don't know what to do. Help! Thank you very much!

A:

I don't seem to be having any trouble with it.  I think that you need to have the actual repository name on the end of the address there.
∫ svn list https://svn.csail.mit.edu/mit-ros-pkg/
