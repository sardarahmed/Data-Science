Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Bullet stack

i want to use some elements of bullet library in my code.
In particular I want to convert from quaternions to roll,pitch and yaw.
I've seen that i can do:
btQuaternion q;
double roll, pitch, yaw;
tf::quaternionMsgToTF(msg->pose.pose.orientation, q);
btMatrix3x3(q).getRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);

But I don't know how to include the bullet library in my code.
Any help?

A:

Where did you see that code? Bullet's math library has been forked and is part of TF since ROS Fuerte so the above code should not work. I suggest you use the TF library and the data types tf::Quaternion and bt::Matrix3x3.

i used this code:  tf::Pose pose;
tf::poseMsgToTF(msg->pose.pose, pose);
theta_r = tf::getYaw(pose.getRotation());
