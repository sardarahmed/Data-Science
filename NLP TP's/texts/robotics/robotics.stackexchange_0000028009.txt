Q:

Gazebo 5.4 premature release?

Today I got the following problem when launching Gazebo (Ubuntu 14.04):
[Err] [RTShaderSystem.cc:414] Unable to find shader lib. Shader generating will fail.[Err] [Server.cc:285] Could not open file[worlds/empty.world]
terminate called recursively
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::lock_error> >'
Aborted (core dumped)
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 3322, exit code 134, cmd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver --verbose -e ode worlds/empty.world __name:=gazebo __log:=/home/jvgomez/.ros/log/7bf27612-df0f-11e6-a9b3-7824afa13789/gazebo-2.log].

After investigating a bit I saw that I have the following folders:
/usr/share/gazebo
/usr/share/gazebo-5.3
/usr/share/gazebo-5.4

The first two only have a setup.sh but the third one has media and worlds folder. After copying these to     /usr/share/gazebo-5.3 everything was working again.
Investigating further, I saw that in /usr/bin there are ony 2 binaries : gazebo and gazebo-5.3.0. In fact, synaptic shows that gazebo5-common package has been updated to 5.4.0-1~trusty while the others are still 5.3.0-1~trusty.
Have been those packages released by error? Or for some reason my update is not complete?

Hello Javi:
Thanks for the report, the problem is in our repository. What happened was that the gazebo 5.4.0 i386 build finishes just fine but the gazebo 5.4.0 amd64 failed. All the architectures shared the gazebo-common package this is why you find a mixture of gazebo 5.4.0 for gazebo-common and 5.3.0 for the rest of them.
The buildfarm is building the gazebo5 amd64 packages again, the problem should be fixed in less than two hours.
