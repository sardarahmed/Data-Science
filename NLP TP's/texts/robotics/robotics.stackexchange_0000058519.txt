Q:

Hi, I want to implement path planning algorithm(A star) on turtle-bot

Hi, I want to implement path planning algorithm(A star) on turtle-bot.
Is it possible to do along with amcl demo.
How can i read the obstacles in the map? And how the cost of some position in the map can be changed if i want some places in the map to be avoided.
Can someone suggest me how to go with it.
Thank you.

A:

What you're looking to do is implement your own global planner (interface: base_global_planner).
Read about how all the pieces link together in http://wiki.ros.org/navigation and http://wiki.ros.org/nav_core.
What you're really doing is creating a subclass of http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/nav_core/html/classnav__core_1_1BaseGlobalPlanner.html, overriding the two methods to implement your functionality.
