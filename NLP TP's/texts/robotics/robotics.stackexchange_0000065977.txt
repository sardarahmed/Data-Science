Q:

No Transform to fixed frame map

I am getting a transform error which I have not seen in hydro. I am having difficulty understanding the origin of this error.
I am sending a scan to slam gmapping. Thank you for looking at this.
Transform [sender=unknown_publisher]
For frame [tower_link]: No transform to fixed frame [map]. TF error: [Lookup would require extrapolation into the future. Requested time 539.126000000 but the latest data is at time 539.089000000, when looking up transform from frame [tower_link] to frame [map]]

changed my tf freq on my static transforms from  100 to 10 and get the following error ...but why would it need a freq at all...its static? Why does it change the results. Changing the  "map_update_interval"  does not fix this either. I am not understanding something can someone please explain?

A:

Apparently this was related to ekf_pose and my pose rate once I increased it to 30 form 10 this problem resolved.
