Hey i got the same error
How did you solve it?

A:

The "unsupported shadows type" message implies that your video card can't do what gazebo is asking of it. It should gracefully degrade, but it's possible Ogre (the 3d engine that gazebo uses) is mishandling the case and failing.
If you turn on core dumps with:

ulimit -c unlimited

... then run it again it will put the crash information in ~/ros/core which can then be analyzed with:

gdb --core=~/ros/core <path-to-gazebo-goes-here>/bin/gazebo

That at least will tell you where it's crashing and then perhaps someone else can help more.
