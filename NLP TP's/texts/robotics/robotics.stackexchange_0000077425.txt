Do any of the gazebo tutorials help?

I've updated the title a bit: no need for caps, and this seems to describe better what you are actually looking for.

A:

First of all, you need a model. I assume that you are familiar with URDF and XACRO. After developing model, you need to access joint states (which can be accessed by ROS-Control Package). Once, you have joint states, you can write your ROS Node in C++ or Python by first subscribing to that states and then generating ros torque. You can study this link and it will be very helpful to you. I am also currently in the process of doing it but so far have not succeeded. You can see my discussion on this link.
