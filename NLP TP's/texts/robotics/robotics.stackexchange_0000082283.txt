Q:

question on conversion of depth image

I have a depth image (128, 414, 3) type 64FC3.   I could like to convert this to be acceptable to send to rtabmap_ros/point_cloud_xyzrgb .  However I am not sure how to covert this image into an acceptable form.  Has anyone encounted an issue like this and can suggest a solution other then manually doing the point cloud conversion.
new2 = self.bridge.cv2_to_imgmsg(depth_image,  "bgr8")  
encoding specified as bgr8, but image has incompatible type 64FC3

A:

I worked it out...all three channels where the same...so I just grabbed one and was able to do a astype(np.float32) on it.
