Q:

rosmake cannot find protobuf while making gazebo_worlds in fuerte

Hi,
I am using 'fuerte' on CentOS 64-bit (~ RHEL 6). I am trying to build gazebo_worlds using rosmake, but it fails with the following error:
[rospack] Error: package/stack gazebo depends on non-existent package protobuf
I installed protobuf myself and it exists in a 'lib' dir which is visible to rosmake. The .h files are in an 'include' directory also visible to rosmake. I also have the protobuf egg file in the python site-packages. Then from a post online, I came to know I have to add the following line to .rosinstall, but still the error exists:
- tar: {local-name: protobuf, uri: 'https://code.ros.org/svn/release/download/stacks/protobuf/protobuf-0.1.0/protobuf-0.1.0.tar.bz2',
version: protobuf-0.1.0}
Thanks in advance,
dksr

A:

In fuerte Gazebo expects protobuf installed on the system not as a ROS package.
