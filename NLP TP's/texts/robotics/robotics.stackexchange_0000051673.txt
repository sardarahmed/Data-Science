No, the date of the feature of the obstalces, I don't know what the kinect could obtain from the image~~

I read "date" as "data" :-)

It's my error,do you know how to get the data from the kinect?

A:

Data is published in multiple topics. Go through this link to understand various topics on which kinect publishes data. You can use rviz to to visualize the data.

If you want to avoid obstacles then try gmapping with kinect. http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Build%20a%20map%20with%20SLAM
