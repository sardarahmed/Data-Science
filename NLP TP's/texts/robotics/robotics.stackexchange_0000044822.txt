Is there any app for android mobile to connect to roscore directly?

Please Help.

A:

Have a look here. When running simulation and using your PC as ros master in the android application, you should be able to teleop for instance a turtlebot in gazebo.
Btw. please tag your questions to make sure that people who can help actually find it.

You will probably not find an application that can do exactly that, i.e. you will have to implement something yourself. I doubt that someone here on this site will give you a complete solution, in particular as long as your questions are that high-level and vague. See http://ros.org/wiki/Support
