Q:

Using the CHOMP motion planner in MoveIt!

Hi,
I would like to use the CHOMP motion planner in MoveIt! for a KUKA lightweight arm (with Groovy). I have fairly limited experience with these tools and the tutorials for using CHOMP are limited to integration in arm_navigation and the MoveIt! setup wizard doesn't provide an option for using CHOMP.
If somebody could explain how to modify the according MoveIt! launch files and maybe provide an example I would be grateful.
Thx,
-Robert-

A very basic tutorial has been started here: https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_tutorials/blob/2d7d4a9a1e7c1209c26ffe4be3a049751c8eed4c/doc/chomp_interface_tutorial.rst
It will be found on http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/ once the buildfarm refreshes.
