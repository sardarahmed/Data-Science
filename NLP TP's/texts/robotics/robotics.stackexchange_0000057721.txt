Q:

Serial Communication with 32 bit Micro-controller (Not Arduino!!!)

Hi,
I just started working with ROS and just yesterday got my first program up and running in ROS. I am interested in communicating with a 32 bit Micro-controller which is not Arduino via serial communication. The micro-controller in question is http://www.netburner.com/products/core-modules/mod54415 . I was searching on forum and the internet for simple serial communication between ROS and such micro-controller. I found rosserial which is mostly explained for AVR and Arduino. I also found rosserial_client which can be modified for any hardware apparently but is kind of difficult for me to understand at this stage. I found cereal_port package but it is discontinued for hydro. Everything that I found is geared towards serial communication with arduino. Is there a simple way I can set up serial communication between ROS and micro-controllers? May be I am not looking at the right place but I would appreciate if I can get some help in this matter. Thank you in advance

A:

Just to build on William's answer— creating a rosserial port for your device is very straightforward. The entirety of the Arduino port is contained in the following files:
https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/blob/hydro-devel/rosserial_arduino/src/ros_lib/ros.h
https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/blob/hydro-devel/rosserial_arduino/src/ros_lib/ArduinoHardware.h
All you really need to do is wire up a few functions which tell the rosserial client library how to read and write the serial port. Arduino is definitely not the only supported option, it's just a really common platform, and thus well-suited to being the demonstration.

Thanks for the answer, I will look into it once I get done with my current project. Also lets say I modified the rosserial to work with my Microcontroller  and named it as rosserial_microxxx does that mean the resultant serial code which I will write to set up my microcontroller as a node will be uploaded on the microcontroller or the code will run on a host with ROS? Thanks again.

Also I was looking at rosserial_clent tutorial and it shows that it has avr libraries in to compile the code, what happens if I don't have the libraries for micro-controller for ubuntu but just for the windows?

Hi @nicobari—the tutorial which will be of interest to you is this one: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_client/Tutorials/Adding%20Support%20for%20New%20Hardware .
