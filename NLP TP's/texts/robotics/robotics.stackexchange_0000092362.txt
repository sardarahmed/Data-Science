Q:

Controlling motors in ROS Kinetic on Raspberry Pi 3B

Hello,
I'm new to ROS and I followed this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLiI_IRedhI
I did not use the exact same car but a simple car with a servo motor and a DC motor instead.
At 9:00 of the video, he started to publish some topics but I don't know what servo 1 and servo 2 mean, I have no idea where I should connect the motors to the Raspberry Pi.
Please don't mind my dumb question and thanks for any help.
Some spec:
Raspberry Pi 3B
Ubuntu Mate 16.04
ROS Kinetic
