Q:

problems compiling openni2_camera : package 'OpenNI2' not found

Hey,
I am new to ROS, So kindly forgive me if this problem is too trivial.
I am trying to interface an Occipital Structure sensor with ROS. I followed a couple of tutorials few among which is
http://eras.readthedocs.org/en/latest/servers/body_tracker/doc/setup.html
https://dobots.nl/2014/05/05/asus-xtion-using-openni2-and-ros-on-udoo/
http://forums.structure.io/t/how-to-ros-odroid/1722
I have the Opnenni2 working and the sensor working on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Now I am trying to make the openni2_camera, opnnni2_launch and rgbd_launch in my catkin workspace, but the make fails as its not finding the library libopenni2  or module openni2.
Console o/p:
-- checking for module 'libopenni2'
--   package 'libopenni2' not found
-- checking for module 'OpenNI2'
--   package 'OpenNI2' not found
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:283 (message):
A required package was not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:337 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
openni2_camera/CMakeLists.txt:13 (pkg_check_modules)
I read in the cmake documentation that CMake first check libraries in the ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} so I have also added the path where my libopenni2.so resides. "shown below"
akshay@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ echo $CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
/opt/ros/indigo/share/OpenNI2/Bin/x86-Release:
But the compilation still fails. Iâ€™m not sure, how to add the path of the library so that the dependencies are fulfilled.
Kindly HElp!!!!

A:

Yeah, I tried include_directories to include the path where openni2 was built, but didn't work. I tried "sudo  apt-get install ros-indigo-openni2-launch" as suggested in a few discussions, and it worked. It also installed the required dependencies so, i was able to get my occipital sensor working.
