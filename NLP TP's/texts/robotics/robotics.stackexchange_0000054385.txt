Q:

How to play bagfile from a specific point( i.e not from start of the bagfile)?

My Bag file is taken from lidar and that file contains the following information.
    path:        file2.bag
    version:     2.0
    duration:    3:47s (227s)
    start:       Nov 08 2012 16:19:48.77 (1352371788.77)
    end:         Nov 08 2012 16:23:36.39 (1352372016.39)

                 /velodyne_packets         2949 msgs    :velodyne_msgs/VelodyneScan

/GPSFIX contains Latitude and longitude informations. I want to play the bag file from specific latitude and logitude value. How should i do this?

A:

You can start playing file from specific time with parameter -s, but you will have to find this time yourself. It can be done either manually or via rosbag API. Basically, you will have to iterate through all the messages and test them against necessary conditions, e.g. GPS coordinates. For this kind of tasks I personally prefer Python, but there is C++ API as well. You can find some code snippets here.
For details on rosbag play commandline usage, please see rosbag/Commandline/play.
