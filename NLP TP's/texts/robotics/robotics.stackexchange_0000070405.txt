Q:

Compiling scan_tools

I am trying to compile the scan_tools package but openni-dev and csm packages are missing.
I found the csm pacakge here but when I try to install it using
apt-get install ros-indigo-csm
It can't be found.
And openno-dev is already installed so why can't be found?
This is the result of

dpkg -l | grep openni

A:

laser_scan_matcher has recently gone through major restructuring, and

now it's available via DEB. I suggest you use DEB unless you have specific needs.
it's upstream dependency CSM is separately built. If you want to source build you need to download its source and build together in your catkin workspace.

At the date you posted the question, it's very likely the work was ongoing, so it's worth giving a try now.
