Q:

New groovy install roscore error

Did a full-desktop install on a netbook and workstation Ubuntu 12.04 that had a working Fuerte (/opt/ros/fuerte/ folder still there) & modified the .bashrc to only source groovy:
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.2.18
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.2.32:11311   
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

roscore gives following error:
$~/ros_workspace$ roscore
WARNING: unable to configure logging. No log files will be generated
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Cannot locate [roslaunch]Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion roslaunch] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is 
Environment paths only point to groovy folders. Should I delete or move the /opt/ros/fuerte/ folder?
What should I check?

I suspect this is related to http://answers.ros.org/question/61981/is-rosversion-broken-on-groovy/

A:

ahendrix advice led to discovering that several packages were indeed installed by pip, which somewhere in the process I removed. So installed pip from Aptitude. Also with another ROS Answer from hersh 'cannot run roscore due to error in rosversion', Oct 19 '12  uninstalled rosinstall, rospkg, rosdep, vcstools, catkin-pkg, pyYusb with "sudo pip uninstall PACKAGE", several times in some cases until that package was not found. However, now still have one error message from roscore,
~$ roscore
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/groovy/bin/roscore", line 62, in  import roslaunch
File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/init.py", line 46, in  import rospkg
ImportError: No module named rospkg
Fixed by installing python-rospkg with aptitude ($sudo apt-get install python-rospkg) and apt-get update that did a lot of cleanup.
