Q:

Accessing saved obstacle grid map within my program

When I create an obstacle grid map using gmapping and my pr2 in gazebo, how do I make that map available to my code. If I provide the map as a service using: rosrun map_server map_server map.yaml, can I still subscribe to the /map topic to access it within my program?

A:

In your program you can use either the service or the topic that map_server provides.
