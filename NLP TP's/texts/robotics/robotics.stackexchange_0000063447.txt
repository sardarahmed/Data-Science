Q:

Skeletal tracker for Asus Xtion Pro Live

Hi. I'm new to the forum and I've a problem with skeletal tracking by using Asus Xtion Pro Live. I've installed openni2_camera and openni2_launch and the system fuction correctly. So I can use Xtion Pro Live with ros, and I can create a pointclouder in rviz and other tools. I've tried to use openni_tracker to tracking the skeleton but this node does not function with Xtion Pro Live. Does anyone has the same problem? Does anyone known if there is an alternative node can I use to track the skeleton with Xtion Pro Live? Thank you for your attention!

A:

This morning I solved my problem. Below I explain what I've done.

From this source I installed the openni2_tracker from this link: https://github.com/futureneer/openni2-tracker
Then I downloaded NiTE-2.0.0 from this link http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/openni-sdk-history-2/
Since this link has died I used web archive to open the site
I downoloaded OpenNI2. I don't remember the way, but could be from this link https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI2
At this point I modified the CMakeLists.txt in the openni2_tracker package (I've this package on my sandbox in the groovy_workspace). The change I made, indicates the path relative at the folder that contain the two folders  NiTE-2.0.0 and OpenNI2. This should be done because openni2_tracker use NiTE-2.0.0 and OpenNI2 to work. Compile the package to apply the change.
Since the command

rosrun openni2_tracker openni2_tracker

doesn't work I tried to use

roslaunch openni2_tracker tracker.launch

In this way I've seen that that the system need of the NiTE2 data, so I created a link of the folder NiTE2 (this folder is the NiTE-2.0.0 folder in the path Redist) in the .ros folder (.ros folder it's a hidden folder in the home). I run the command

roslaunch openni2_tracker tracker.launch

The tracker work and with rviz I can see the skeleton tracking. I haven't yet try if openni2_tracker work with openni2_lunch. When I try I update the answer.
Scuse me if I writed some inaccuracies but I'm a rookie. Thank you for your attention.

Hi, I'm trying to use
roslaunch openni2_tracker tracker.launch
But it gives me the next error
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [openni2_tracker/tracker]: can't locate node [tracker] in package [openni2_tracker]
Do you know what the problem is? im using ROS-Indigo on UBUNTU 14.04 and XTION

@jaam002, so did you manage to solve it? If so, how? Because I'm stuck with the same problem, as well.
Comment by jaam002 on 2015-08-30:
@ishareef yeah, the problem was i was using the openni2_tracker from futureneer and the CMake file of it was developed for "rosbuild" and not for "catkin". Nevertheless, the skeleton_tracker from Chaos works with catkin, so i used it.

in step 4, you talk about modifying the openni2_tracker CMakeLists.txt file.
Which lines do you change?  It's not obvious to me...
Thanks.
