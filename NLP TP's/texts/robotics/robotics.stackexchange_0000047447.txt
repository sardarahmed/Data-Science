Q:

Unable to run cameracalibrator.py

Hi,
I want to calibrate two individual cameras as a stereocamera.
So i tried running the file cameracalibrator.py from the path /opt/ros/fuerte/stackes/image_pipeline/camera_calibration/nodes.
Im getting an error
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/image_pipeline/camera_calibration/nodes/cameracalibrator.py", line 42, in 
from camera_calibration.approxsync import ApproximateSynchronizer
I could not find this module camera_calibration.approxsync located anywhere.
Kindly let me know where i am missing
Thanks in advance

perfect..thank you so much.  Later I had the issue with import cv_bridge and solved that by adding the path to cv_bridge to pythonpath...

A:

search for appoxsync in your camera_calibration package. Then place it in the same folder as your source file. Replace the line "from camera_calibration.approxsync" with "from approxsync" and this should work. Let me know if you have any issues in this
