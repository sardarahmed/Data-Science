Q:

how to use rxplot to plot data on /tf

ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte
How to use rxplot to plot the transforms?
They have the position and orientation.
Example
header:
seq: 0
stamp:
secs: 1311867210
nsecs: 774027961
frame_id: /world
child_frame_id: /kinect
transform:
translation:
x: 0.208460861206
y: -1.06889804077
z: 1.87455181885
rotation:
x: -0.0425775370706
y: -0.0287192089576
z: 0.77849649613
w: 0.625544215773

A:

In my opinion, rxplot is not the best tool at plotting tf's. I would recommend you to use rviz for that.
If you want to see x, y and z positions and orientations maybe you should consider using an odometry or pose topic parsed from the node tf or something similar, in order to avoid what Adolfo Rodr√≠guez comments.

There is no "best tool", as the goodness measure depends a lot on your requirements. Rviz excels at visualizing instantaneous frame configurations, but if you're interested in visualizing time series a plotting tool might be more appropriate.
Comment by Adolfo Rodriguez T on 2013-04-03:
...additionally the details of a specific implementation can make your life easier or harder. Plotting  a /tf time series with rxplot/rqt has its difficulties, but plotting a pose_stamped topic is straightforward. YMMV...
