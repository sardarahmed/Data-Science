Q:

Using custom field types in a ROS message

Is it at all possible to construct a message containing fields with an arbitrary type?
For instance, I would like to create a message containing an array of type pcl::Correspondence. Is this possible or would I have to convert this to a group of primitive objects first?

A:

Since ROS messages generate code for many languages, it isn't possible to use language-specific types within message.
You'll have to convert your types into ROS types.
You can also adapt C++ types for serialization (see: http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/MessagesSerializationAndAdaptingTypes ), but this still doesn't allow them to be used within other messages.
