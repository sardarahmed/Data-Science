Q:

What knowledge should I have if I want to establish a robotics company?

I know, robotics may refer to many things and it's extremely large field today. But if I can narrow the topic to something like Aldebaran(the company makes Nao robots), what knowledge should I have as a founder and manager of this company?
I really love to have a company like that, and know somethings from OpenCV to ARM-microcontrollers programming, and few experience in Solidworks and Altium designer!
But as you know this is a very big field and the more I read/learn, the more I'm disappointed! I think I can't to reach a point that I can say tomorrow I will create a team and start my first robot project, Cause I think there are many many things that I don't know and many skills that I don't have!
So it made me to ask this question here to know, what knowledge or skills really needed to establish some company like Aldebaran or similar companies?
NOTE: I don't talk about simple robot projects like line following robots, I am talking about Humanoid intelligent robots with Machine Vision, Listening/Speaking abilities and good mechanical ability(icub robot for another example)
Who with what knowledge can make such company and lead a great engineering team of computer/electronics/mechanics/others?

A:

You need enough domain knowledge to be able to tell if someone is bullshitting you or not, to be able to determine when someone has an achievable or unachievable project idea, to be able to determine who has talent and who doesn't, etc.
And money. A lot of money. Quality engineers don't work for free.
