Q:

Error compiling a package on groovy

Hi,
when trying to compile a package on groovy I get the following error.
make clean
  make[1]: Entering directory `/home/jworch/groovy_workspace/sandbox/cram_core/3rdparty/alexandria'
  rm -rf alexandria asdf alexandria-20110210.tar.bz2
  rm -f downloaded rospack_nosubdirs installed unpacked
  make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/jworch/groovy_workspace/sandbox/cram_core/3rdparty/alexandria'
  `rospack find rosbuild`/bin/download_checkmd5.py [censored_karma] alexandria-20110210.tar.bz2
  /bin/sh: 1: /opt/ros/groovy/share/rosbuild/bin/download_checkmd5.py: not found
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}
[ rosmake ] Output from build of package alexandria written to:
[ rosmake ]    /home/jworch/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20130321-194802/alexandria/build_output.log
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< alexandria [FAIL] [ 0.07 seconds ]                                              
[ rosmake ] Halting due to failure in package alexandria. 

It it is supposed to pull a tarball which is not held in the package repository. It worked on fuerte and I guess it fails because of the missing *.py file. Is there any substitute on groovy for that file or another/better way to solve this problem?
Thanks in advance

A:

I ran into the same problem, and thought it to be an error of rosbuild because download_checkmd5.py was there but could no longer be found using rospack or roscd. I opened up a ticket on github (https://github.com/ros/ros/issues/17).
One of the answers Thomas provided helped me solve the issue: Using the environment variable $ROS_ROOT to get to the script. The line to download the tarball in my Makefile now looks like this:
$(shell echo $$ROS_ROOT)/core/rosbuild/bin/download_checkmd5.py $(TARBALL_URL) $(TARBALL)
I did not try the second solution he proposed (using one of the rosbuild-macros) -- it sure sounds promising.
