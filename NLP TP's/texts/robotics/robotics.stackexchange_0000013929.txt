Q:

Robot real time control

I want to control a arduino based robot in real time , i am confused whether simulink real time control is a better option or Using ROS ?? 
I am familiar with the simulink , My application is to controlling the robot using controller with time delay .
Can anyone suggest me which way should i go ?

A:

ROS is not offering real time(RT) control by default. Specially ROS 1.0, ROS 2.0 is still under development. Though there are many hacky/tweaky ways to let ROS perform in soft RT. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have some maturity in ROS.
