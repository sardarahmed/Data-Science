Q:

What is the bicycle model for a dynamic robot?

I was asked this in a phone interview for a robotics job. Googling has not really helped. I assume it is some sort of state prediction model that can be used in a Kalman filter.
Can anyone give me a formal description? A link to a reference would also be nice.
EDIT to clarify, the interview was for a self-driving car company and before the question we had been discussing Kalman filters, Particle filters, and path planning algorithms (A*).

A:

The bicycle model is a simplified model of vehicle dynamics. It's really common so I'm not sure why a web search did not get any results for you.
A random paper, first one in my search that had a diagram and was not behind a paywall...
Modification of Vehicle Handling Characteristics via Steer-by-Wire
