Q:

Installing ROS on Debian

Hello everyone,
I have a problem getting ROS up and running on my gumstix board.My configuration is:
Operating Platform : Gumstix
Operating System ( on the board ): Debian
ROS version : electric
I followed a tutorial on ROS.org (ttp://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Debian) to install ROS. After i install all the components i try to start the roscore with the command : " roscore "
And i get the fallowing output:
File "/root/ros/ros/bin/roscore", line 34, in <module>
  from ros import roslaunch
File "/root/ros/ros/core/roslib/src/ros/__init__.py", line 57, in __getattr__
  return __import__(name)
File "/root/ros/ros_comm/tools/roslaunch/src/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 53, in>
  from roslaunch.scriptapi import ROSLaunch
File "/root/ros/ros_comm/tools/roslaunch/src/roslaunch/scriptapi.py", line 42, i>
  import roslaunch.parent
File "/root/ros/ros_comm/tools/roslaunch/src/roslaunch/parent.py", line 55, in <>
  import roslaunch.server
File "/root/ros/ros_comm/tools/roslaunch/src/roslaunch/server.py", line 70, in <>
  from rosgraph_msgs.msg import Log
ImportError: No module named rosgraph_msgs.msg

Then i ran the command " roswtf " and it's output is :
ERROR: The ROS communication libraries have not been built. To fix:
rosmake ros_comm
Then i run " rosmake ros_comm " and i get :
Could not detect OS. platform detection will not work
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['ros_comm']

When i run roswtf again i get the same error as before and roscore still does not initialize.
Please help me with this problem because i cannot figure out what is missing or not working properly. I thank you in advance for your answers.

A:

You are missing a system dependency, but due to a small bug we cannot tell which.
fix the bug by editing "/root/ros/ros/tools/rosmake/src/rosmake/engine.py", line 872
self.printer.print_all("rosdep check failed to find system dependencies: %s" % self.rosdep_check_result)

and run again. This line is already fixed in the electric source,
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/branches/ros-1.6/tools/rosmake/src/rosmake/engine.py
but apparently was not released with version 1.6.9 of the ros stack.
