No one is going to help you like this; they can't. We don't know what OS, which version of ROS, version of ros_control, what you are trying to do, what you already have done, what failed nor what you tried to solve it yourself. Please update your question with the revelant information.

A:

Without further information (as the question comment states), all I can say is that you don't have a controller_manager running on the rbcar/controller_manager namespace. If a controller_manager is indeed running, it's not in rbcar/controller_manager, which is where the spawner script is being launched (and is expecting to find it).
