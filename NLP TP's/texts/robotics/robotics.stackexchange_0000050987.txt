Q:

Only need one package within metapackage

How can a single package be selected from a metapackage rather than installing all packages within a metapackage?
Example: Geometry (http://ros.org/wiki/geometry). I only need tf.

A:

If you are using the debian packages, simply install the package instead of the metapackage:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-tf

This will only work for catkinized packages.

I may have found the issue with this process on a BeagleBone. Apparently there are problems with checking out debian packages onto this ARM device.

So how do we get individual "non-catkinized" packages for the ARM processor/BeagleB?

You download them from source and delete the rest.
