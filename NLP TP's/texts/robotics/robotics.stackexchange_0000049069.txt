Q:

Displaying a precomputed trajectory problem

When I follow the instructions on this page to plot trajectories in Rviz previously recorded from a .YAML file I get the following error: (add all sesion)
diego@ubuntu:~$ rosrun walk_msgs generator _yaml:=/home/diego/Descargas/dropping_the_ball.yaml
fatal error: yaml-cpp: error at line 7, column 3: key not found: left-hand
 [ERROR] [1362606276.617362117]: fatal error: yaml-cpp: error at line 7, column 3: key not found:     left-hand***

A:

Sorry about the delay, I pushed a fix (commit 6e514d0) on master branch. It should be working now (pull, recompile and retest).
