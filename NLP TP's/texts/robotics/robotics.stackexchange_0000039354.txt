Q:

Gyro for Turtlebot?

I'm in the process of creating my own TurtleBot since I have most of the parts already. However it seems the sparkfun gyro suggested on turtlebot.com has been discontinued. Can anyone suggest a good alternate gyro or IMU? Preferably the device would be a drop in replacement for the gyro (i.e. will work with the TurtleBot dashboard w/o modification).
