Q:

android_tutorial_teleop building in android studio, Windows

Hello.
I am working on Windows 7 / Android Studio 1.2.2 / JRE 1.8.0.
Trying to build (android_tutorial_teleop) package in [android_core].
Downloaded source from here.  link text
Imported [android_core] in Android Studio.
Selected (android_tutorial_teleop)  in "Selelct Run/Debug Configuration".
And pressed green "Run" button.
It build and launched in emulator.
[1]
In emulator.  This app is executed.
Entered host IP address and pressed "Connect" button.
But it crashed.
[2]
I copied "android_tutorial_teleop-debug.apk" to my android phone. (from ../build/output/apk/)
Installed it.  Executed App.
Entered host IP address and pressed "Connect" button.
But it crashed also.
I searched similar issues in "answers.ros.org".  but couldn't find solution.
I think "rosjava_core" is needed. But I don't know how to make it in Android Studio in Windows 7.
What did I miss?
Thank you in advance.

Is there a reason you aren't using Linux? Windows is not entirely supported in ROS (at least to my knowledge).

A:

Thank you.  Yes. ROS is basically based on Linux.
Anyway I solved this issue. Searched and read other developers writing.
I need  "  ", for following.  without it, the app crashed.
export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://192.168.178.21:11311"
export ROS_HOSTNAME="192.168.178.21"
