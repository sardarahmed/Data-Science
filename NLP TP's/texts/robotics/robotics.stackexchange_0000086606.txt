Q:

husky A200 setup

Hi,
I am trying to set up a Husky a200 in my school research lab. I tried to followed the instruction on how to set it up, but I got confused on the order of instructions.
Following this website, In step 1, I went through the ROS and catkin beginner tutorials by downloading Ubuntu 16.04 and kinetic distribution. Then, I tried to follow the Install and Configure Husky Software link to setup the Husky, and this is where I get confused.
In the link, it told me to install Indigo Husky ISO image file onto my robot PC, since I already have ubuntu 16.04 and ROS installed from doing the tutorial, does this mean, I need to wipe it and install the Indigo Husky ISO image file instead?

A:

Yes, that ISO image is a disk image that will overwrite all other data. You may want to backup what you have done into another image before installing the Husky ISO. Then, if plan B doesn't work, you may revert to plan A. I believe the ISO image has ROS Indigo and Ubuntu Trusty.

hello, what if I have an UR5 manipulator attached to my husky? it seems like the ISO image provided from the husky website is only for just the husky platform

The UR5 software should be installed after the Husky software is functional. You may download it here:
