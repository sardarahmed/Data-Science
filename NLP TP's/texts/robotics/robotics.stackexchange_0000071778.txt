Q:

OSX rgbdslam install via indigo

#On Hold
Holding off on rgbdslam install to El Capitan until ros libs progress for osx 10.11+
interim solution was to install rgbdslam v2 via ros indigo + Ubuntu 14.04 + rEFind for osx

ROS Indigo took some work to install on OSX El Captian (10.11.3) but it works now.
At this point I can attempt to install rgbdslam
$ rosdep install rgbdslam

But I'm getting the following error:
$ rosdep install rgbdslam
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rgbdslam: No definition of [libdevil-dev] for OS [osx]

I have devIL installed via brew:
$ brew install devil
Warning: devil-1.7.8_1 already installed

At this point I'm stuck. What should I do?
** EDIT **

Tried installing libdevil from source, unsuccessfully.
Installed libdevil via macports. Didn't help so I uninstalled macports since brew is my preferred package manager.

** EDIT **

Set siftgpu_disable_devil = 0 in SiftGPU/makefile
set(ENV{SIFT_GPU_MODE} 0) in CMakeLists.txt

I'm still seeing rgbdslam: No definition of [libdevil-dev] for OS [osx]

A:

Try removing the dependency from rgbdslam/package.
Should you get compilation/linking problems, try to set the CMake-Variable USE_SIFT_GPU to 0 (e.g., using cmake-gui). SiftGPU is the thing in rgbdslam that needs libdevil

And have you removed the dependency in package.xml?

Commenting devIL out in package.xml put me a little further but into some seemingly OSX specific issues, trying to resolve those via github. Will respond here once I have a solution. Thanks for your assistance.
