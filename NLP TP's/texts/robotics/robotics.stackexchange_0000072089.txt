Q:

Is the current version of Phantom omni device (Geomagic Touch) compatible with ROS?

Hi,
I am wondering if the current version of the PHANToM Omni device (the Geomagic Touch http://www.geomagic.com/en/products/phantom-omni/overview) is compatible with ROS or not.
Actually, i am going to buy one of them and i want to be sure that it is compatible with ROS.
Thanks!

Thank you for your answer!

A:

First of all make sure it is compatible with modern Linux distributions. Even before SensAble was acquired by Geomagic there were a lot of problems with their proprietary drivers. If it is the same hardware and same drivers then there are couple of ROS packages that might work with it.
