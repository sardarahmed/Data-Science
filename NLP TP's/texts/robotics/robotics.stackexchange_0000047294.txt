Q:

Can't use Rviz plugin ObjectSegmentation object_segmentation_gui (interactive object segmentation)

ROS Fuerte 
PR2 Gazebo
I'm testing PR2 Interactive Object Detection. When I add try to add a plugin to Rviz,   the ObjectSegmentation plugin from object_segmentation_gui,   Rviz segfaults and dies (see backtrace below).
The segfault is almost identical if using stereo camera or Kinect, so you can ignore the line "withDisparityChecked".
Also, when I tick the box to enable "interactive" (object segmentation) mode, the pop-up doesn't load, because it's not working I guess...
Funny thing, this pop-up worked the first time I tested PR2 Interactive Object Detection... now I realize it's broken.
Does anyone have some suggestions please?
cheers, 
David.

A:

The Interactive Object Segmentation plugin is highly experimental, research code. Unfortunately, we are not able to actively support this version.
The version here might be more promising:

But you'd have to contact the authors for more details on its current status.
