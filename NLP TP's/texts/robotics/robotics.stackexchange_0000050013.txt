A:

Do you mean a map like the ones created with slam gmapping? If so, you can just make a picture of how you want your map to be.
The pgm (picture) :
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40610835/square.pgm
The corresponding yaml file :
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40610835/square.yaml
This is a 'map' of a square area of I believe 50x50 meters.

The picture is a map, it is a square area surrounded by walls. Define what you need better if this isn't what you mean.
