Q:

Keep door closed until handle is turned

I am looking for a door model that will not open until the handle is turned.
At present I have tried the hinged_door and heavy_door models from the database and they can just be pushed open regardless of the state of the handle.
Can someone please direct me to a model/ world file that achieves this? Or can it be done with the existing models and am I doing something wrong?

You could modify the existing models with a model plugin which implements the behaviour you want. I imagine someone might have done this before...

A:

Chapulina has suggested a model plugin, which is definitely a good choice. Or, just make the latch mechanically! Unless you'd rather write code to do it, I a simple mechanical latch would be easy. Take advantage of the fact that you have real physics
