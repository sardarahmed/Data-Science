Q:

ros indigo on a raspberry pi won't start because of missing roslaunch

I installed ros Indigo on a brand new raspbian wheezy follwing the tutorial from the wiki.
I get this
pi@RPiMower /opt/ros/indigo/bin $ sudo ./roscore
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./roscore", line 62, in <module>
    import roslaunch
ImportError: No module named roslaunch

but when i start python i can Import roslaunch without Problems.
pi@RPiMower /opt/ros/indigo/bin $ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Mar 18 2014, 05:13:23)
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import roslaunch
>>>

What's wrong?

Now i found
 export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

to solve that. Where would you put that line in?
But now i get
ROS master URI is not set

and will go on searching...

found out that export can do all that from the commandline - but is that really the way to do it? No config file or something like that?

A:

The Problem is the use of sudo. try ist with without  if you need the root rithgts then try dis
sudo su
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
./roscore
or
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
sudo -E  ./roscore
