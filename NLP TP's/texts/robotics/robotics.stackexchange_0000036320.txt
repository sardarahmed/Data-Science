Q:

Android Directory for rosjava

Hi,
I am trying to install the android directory in the rosjava directory by using
"hg clone https://code.googlecode.com/p/rosjava.android/"
However this doesn't work as the connection gets timed out.
Is there another way to get the android directory?
-Thanks

A:

It looks like google code is changing their infrastructure layout.  According to the project website instructions the correct command to use is:
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava/

I do see a lot of references to the url style in the question in our documentation, but the servers are unresponsive.
