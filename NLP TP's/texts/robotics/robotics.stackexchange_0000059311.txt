Q:

C++ problem: using function

void imageCallback(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& msg)
{
//Programme
}
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
image_transport::Subscriber sub = it.subscribe("/camera/image_color", 1, imageCallback);
image_transport::Subscriber sub_depth = it.subscribe("/camera/depth/image", 1, imageCallback);
}
The imageCallback subscriber to the camera; I have two cameras.
The question is how can I use imageCallback in the two differents subscribes, because in that way it doesn't work, I got the two camera's image in the same window = like Toggle images  !!?

A:

You could create a second callback function, or add an additional argument to your existing callback, and pass in additional data using boost::bind.

OK, this is I think the only way to do that using boost::bind.
Thank you so much.
