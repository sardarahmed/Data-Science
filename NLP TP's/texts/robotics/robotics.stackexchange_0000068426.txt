Q:

Turtlebot simulator laser scan not working

Hi everyone,
I'm learning ROS and I'm trying to follow this tutorial link: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/hydro/Explore%20the%20Gazebo%20world, when I put several objects in the gazebo, and ran the command
roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch. I expected to see the laser sensor and camera can read this and show their information in the Rviz, however it just gave me a blank screen without any sensory information. The image doesn't work properly either. Anybody has any ideas ? I'm using ubuntu 12.04, ROS Hydro, and gazebo 1.9.6. The global fixed frame is "base_link", the laserscan topic is /scan, and the image topic is /camera/depth/image_raw and /camera/rgb/image_raw
Thanks very much !

A:

Hello, I'm also use ROS Hydro.
I can work by following instruction:
export TURTLEBOT_BASE=create
export TURTLEBOT_STACKS=circles
export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=asus_xtion_pro
optirun roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_playground.launch

You can have a try~
