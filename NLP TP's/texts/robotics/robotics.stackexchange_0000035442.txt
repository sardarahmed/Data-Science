Q:

openni_kinect: [openni_node1-2] process has died

Hello,
I'm using Ubuntu 10.04.3 and the ros-electric-openni-kinect package. When I try
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

I receive
[ INFO] [1320414269.335861019]: [/openni_node1] Number devices connected: 1
[ INFO] [1320414269.337386912]: [/openni_node1] 1. device on bus 001:08 is a Xbox NUI Camera (2ae) from Microsoft (45e) with serial id 'A003619160******'
[ INFO] [1320414269.343809795]: [/openni_node1] searching for device with index = 1
[openni_node1-2] process has died [pid 1734, exit code -4].

By searching the web, I found out that the reason for this is probably that my CPU does not support SSE3 instructions. As the only solution (apart from buying a new CPU) seems to be a manual source-based installation of the openni_kinect stack, I tried to follow the advice given here, but the CMakeLists.txt does not contain the line which is mentioned there.
Can anybody confirm that the pre-compiled package (installed by sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect) requires SSE3 support? And, if so, what would be the easiest way to obtain a build that only makes use of SSE2 instructions?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Try building it from source yourself and turning off the SSE3 in the configuration step.

Thank you for your answer! I didn't really know what you mean by "configuration step", so I simply tried to compile it without any modification and it works :) I guess the "rosbuild_check_for_sse ()" in "CMakeLists.txt" switched off SSE3 automatically so there was no need to change any flag by hand.
