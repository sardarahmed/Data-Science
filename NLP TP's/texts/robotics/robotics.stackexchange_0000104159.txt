Q:

rosparam param="source_list"

I don't know what <rosparam param="source_list"> means and barely found a clear description of it, especially on the official website. Here is the snippet I found online
   <node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher">
        <rosparam param="source_list">["hand_model/joint_states"]</rosparam>
   </node>

Is source_list a description of the data transmitted via topic hand_model/joint_states?
A detailed explanation would be appreciated! Thanks!

A:

This xml tag has nothing to do with ros publish/subscribe. ros1 provides a simple key/value property database called the "parameter server".
For this tag, param specifies the property name you want to create (or overwrite) on the parameter server. If the property name does not start with a /, the string is prepended with the current node namespace.
For the example you show, the full parameter property name is: /joint_state_publisher/source_list.
This property is assigned the value: ["hand_model/joint_states"]
The value in a rosparam tag is defined to be yaml, so the square brackets cause this value to be parsed as a yaml list before it is stored to the parameter server.
If you just want to store a basic literal string, int or float value, most people use the <param .../> tag instead (which does not perform this yaml parsing.)
