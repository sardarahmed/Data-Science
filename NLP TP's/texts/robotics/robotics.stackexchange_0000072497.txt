Q:

openni_launch doesn't work with kinect

Hello All,
Working in Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 I cannot get my kinect to work when using
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

It only gives
[ INFO] [1457006309.632299424]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

But the kinect is working perfectly with
roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch

What could be the problem?
Thanks in advance, Sietse

A:

The problem was that I didn't read the documentation of the ROS package openni_camera properly:(.
In that documentation there is a section: Use Kinect on Ubuntu with OpenNI
In a blog that is referred to it is described that you have to install a special version of openni and a sensor module.
I followed the recipe and it works!
