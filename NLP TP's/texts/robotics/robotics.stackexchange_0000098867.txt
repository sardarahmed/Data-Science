Q:

what does "abandoned" mean with catkin build?

catkin build tells me that some number of packages in my workspace are "abandoned". what does this mean? Is there some way to list which packages are abandoned?

A:

It basically means those have not been included in the current build (as in: not by choice or request of the user, but because circumstances made it impossible to include them or finish building them).
Typically caused by (one of) their dependencies having failed to build.
Taken from the source:

# List of jobs whose deps failed

abandoned_jobs = []
