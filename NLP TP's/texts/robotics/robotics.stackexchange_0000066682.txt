Q:

Why catkin_make doesn't create executables?

When I try to build the client-server C++ tutorial with catkin_make it doesn't create any executables, I think I have everything else in order.
I had followed every single step in the previous tutorials, the worspace is correctly configured, the CMakeLists.txt seems in order as the package.xml.
Here is the link to the tutorial.http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28c%2B%2B%29
And the output when I try to build and then execute.
viki@c3po:~$ cd ~/catkin_ws/

viki@c3po:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make

viki@c3po:~$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_server

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named add_two_ints_server below /home/viki/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials

This is not enough information to be able to help you. Please edit your question to include a link to the tutorial you're following. Every command you're running and the exact console output, what's in your workspace, and any other relevant information to reproduce your problem. wiki.ros.org/Support

Could you add your workspace environment variables ? You can have them with
export | grep ROS

A:

The output at the bottom tells you exactly what the problem is. The syntax of rosrun is rosrun PACKAGE EXECUTABLE [ARGS]. You are not providing an executable to rosrun.

Sorry I wrote that incorrectly, anyway when I write "rosrun begginer_tutorials add_two_ints_server" it says the same thing, add_two_ints_sever is the executable  created when building add_two_ints_server.cpp, but the problem is that the executable is never created. Also there is no need of arguments

I edited the question so you can see the output when I write the correct command
