Q:

Get main RenderPanel from Display

Hey,
I need to grab a pointer to rviz main RenderPanel - the one that renders the scene - from a Display plugin.
I've managed to grab a RenderPanel but in some cases there are more than one and I haven't found a way to identify them yet.

Okay, I just accidentally found out how to get it while searching for a way to get the ViewController.
You get it as follows:
Your class should have a **DisplayContext *** property called context_.
Through this property we can access the ViewManager by calling context_->getViewManager() that can give us a reference to the RenderPanel by calling getRenderPanel().
So in short to grab the RenderPanel you simply call:
rviz::RenderPanel* panel = context_->getViewManager()->getRenderPanel();
