Q:

Connecting to Dynamixel Bus Tutorial

I am following Dynamixel tutorials on ROS Wiki.
http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/ConnectingToDynamixelBus
In Step 2 : Create a launch file for the manager node, The code of the controller_manager.launch file is not visible.
I tried going to the web address but there it shows some kind of error on that page.
Can anyone fix this or get me that code?

Code moved to GitHub: https://github.com/arebgun/dynamixel_motor/blob/master/dynamixel_tutorials/launch/controller_manager.launch
Will fix the wiki once I have write permissions.
