Q:

Robot on same network (Ubuntu/Fedora)

Hey all,
I'm using a robot with a ubuntu 14,04 and ros indigo and my own computer with  Fedora 23 and a source install of ros indigo.
I'm trying to connect them using the wifi network generated by my robot.
I fixed the env variable for both platform. On my computer with a fixed IP of 10.0.0.115 :
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.0.0.3:11311
ROS_HOSTNAME=10.0.0.115
ROS_IP=10.0.0.115

On the robot, I did :
robot@ROBOT:~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.0.0.3:11311
robot@ROBOT:~$ export ROS_IP=10.0.0.3
robot@ROBOT:~$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=10.0.0.3

After this. if I launch the roscore on the robot, I can listen to everything that is publish from the robot on my computer but everything that is publish from my computer to the robot is lost.
If I run roswtf on my computer it doesn't return any errors while, on the robot, roswtf return this :
Found 2 error(s).

ERROR Could not contact the following nodes:
 * /rostopic_8305_1450259505852

ERROR Errors connecting to the following services:

I tried the same step I used on my fedora on a Ubuntu computer and the publishing from the computer worked fine. I did very step that is on this page and they all worked apart from the netcat one. I can write from my computer to the robot alright but is I open a port o my computer using nc -l 1234 and try to write to it on the robot with netcat 10.0.0.115 1234 then the command return without doing anything :
robot@ROBOT netcat 10.0.0.115 1234
robot@ROBOT:~$ 

It seems that the robot cannot connect the topic published from my computer and I'm at a loss as to why. Any help is appreciated :)
