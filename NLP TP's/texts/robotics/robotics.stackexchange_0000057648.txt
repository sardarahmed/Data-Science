Q:

Ubuntu 13.10 has problem installing from source, due to "gazebo2" package, does it really exist?

Hi all
when i try to install on Ubuntu 13.10 ROS Medusa-hydro full from source, while running :
$ rosinstall_generator desktop_full --rosdistro hydro --deps --wet-only --tar > hydro-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall
$ wstool init -j8 src hydro-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall
wstool claim about a problem with a gazebo2 package.
Can you please help me? any suggestion?
I've checked in .rosinstall and i've found no package with that name....

A:

This is a open bug until there is a stable build of gazebo2 for Ubuntu 13.10.
In the meantime, there are a few solutions here: http://answers.ros.org/question/129616/error-while-building-catkin_ws-in-ubuntu-1310/ and a suggestion to install the beta gazebo2 package manually by the gazebo developers: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/2906#issuecomment-35412728

Thank you for the suggestion
just for my understanding, since I'm new in ROS: if i use rosdep check, then rosdep install will install only dependancies that can be satisfied?
Thank you for your answer

rosdep check will tell you which dependencies are missing, but it won't install them for you. It will not change the behavior of rosdep install.

You can run the rosdep install ... command with the --simulate option and it will print the commands it would have run, then you can copy and paste the ones you want, i.e. all of them except the gazebo one.

Also there is a proposed pull request to allow the explicit ignoring of dependencies: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/pull/301
