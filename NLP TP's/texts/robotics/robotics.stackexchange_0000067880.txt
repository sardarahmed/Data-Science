Q:

SDF to URDF conversion

Hello everyone!
I am starting from scratch with ROS (just recently installed Jade) and I wanted to ask for some guidance. I have followed all basic ROS tutorials already and my idea was to develop a simulation model with Gazebo that I can control  through ROS nodes. I would afterwards move on to the real robot but only after the simulation model is complete and working properly.
I followed Gazebo's basic tutorials as well (still have some to go through) but the first problem I encountered is my robot has mecanum wheels. I read that the easiest way to go is using the Planar Move Plugin so I looked it up in here and apparently I should first develop a URDF file of my robot. I have been going through the tutorials (first had to learn tf) but I am starting to wonder. Do I really need the URDF file? Is there any way to work directly with SDF files both in ROS and gazebo or at least generate the URDF from the SDF I already have?
I would really appreciate it if someone could clarify this for me.

A:

There is a pull request available for a sdf to urdf converter. I downloaded the source and it worked for me, however, if you have any plugins specified in your SDF, i dont think the person who made the pull request got around to converting plugins in SDF to URDF yet, as i had to manually copy the plugins over to the URDF.

hi!
The bitbucket link doesn't work anymore. Is there a converter? I couldn't find one, I'm using ROS noetic, sdf 1.7 and gazebo 11.
