Dear all,
I follow the step in http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu
When I want to Set up my keys, there is an error: " gpg: can't find available OpenPGP data " .
And the following steps can't work.
How can I solve the problem? Thanks

A:

That's the error you get if your download fails.  I'd suggest you try again.  If it doesn't work please edit your question to include your console output.
Using an invalid url I get that errors:
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.keyinvalid -O - | sudo apt-key add -
