Q:

Add two turtlebot in one .world

Hi,
I am a freshman on ROS and I meet a problem: I write a very simple .py for one turtlebot to move straight, after I add another turtlebot in the world, the original one cannot move, it used to move automatically. I really do not know the reason.
In my launch file, I have not added the node of the second one.

A:

You should take a look at this answer about setting up multiple robots in Gazebo. Don't worry about when the answer was made or that it's probably not the correct version of ROS. Much of it is still applicable.

Thank you, I have fixed the problem. That is because I did not change the publisher information in the code. After I add a new robot, the rostopic list has changed and original robot is changed from "cmd_vel" to "robot_0/cmd_vel"
