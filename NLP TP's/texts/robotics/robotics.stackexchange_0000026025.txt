Q:

Is it possible to simulate a 'belt' between two joints?

I would like to constrain two joints together with a "belt" so that the angles of the two joints remain the same while allowing the forces on each joint to effect the other. Is this possible?
Think of a skid-steer robot with a single motor driving both wheels on the same side of the robot.

A:

there is a pull request (it's just fallen a bit out of date) but the ode_gearbox branch should still work.  An example world and an unit test can be found.  With this, you can simulate gears with arbitrary ratios, the transmission is enforced by constraints.
