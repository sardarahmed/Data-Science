Q:

Unable to Open Com Port

Hi AskUbuntu community.
I want ask a question about the opening of serial ports in Ubuntu. I use Ubuntu 20.04 in my MSI computer.
I want to access a hardware device (A GPS unit) via USB cable. I installed the ROS2 driver of the device and tried the below code example:

ros2 launch sbg_driver sbg_device_launch.py

After that I got the error message:  sbgInterfaceSerialCreate: Unable to open the com port: /dev/sbg
To fix the error, I added myuser to dialout and tty groups but the error did not be fixed.
Can you help me?

This is clearly a cross-post (the OP hasn't even removed the salutation) of Unable to Open Com Port on AskUbuntu.
The cross-post there even has responses.
@mfatih: please do not cross-post, or at least not within a day.

A:

Chances are your serial device is not named /dev/sbg
Try:

Unplugging your usb->serial
converter.
Run ls /dev in a terminal
Plug in the usb->serial converter
Run ls /dev again.
Look for a newly added device (probably something like /dev/ttyUSB0)
Edit config/sbg_device_uart_default.yaml to use the new device instead of /dev/sbg
