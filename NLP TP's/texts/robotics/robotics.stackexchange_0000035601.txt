Q:

Missing ROS_format.xml

I was setting up Eclipse on a fresh Ubuntu install and forgot to save my copy of ROS_format.xml (the C++ auto-formatting for ROS). I went on the site to pull a new copy down (http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs) but the link to the XML file seems to be broken. Anyone know where I can get a copy of the XML file?

Thanks we're working on it.  There appears to have been a regression in the attachment macro on the wiki.  You can still get it directly from the wiki attachment with the full url http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ROS_format.xml

Link is still (or again) broken. The difference with provided here is the parameter "do=view" instead of "do=get".
