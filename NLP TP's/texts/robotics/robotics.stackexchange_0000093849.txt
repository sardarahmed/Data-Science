Q:

ros2 interface command dosen't work

Hello, I'm fairly new to ros so I might be missing something obvious.
During the ros2 tutorial I need to type the command 'ros2 interface', you can see in the image below that I get an error message for that command.
After some trial and error, I found a workaround for that command but when I typed it I got a message that I should use the interface command instead.
I use ros2 eloquent.
~$ ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg
usage: ros2 [-h] Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage. ...
ros2: error: argument Call `ros2 <command> -h` for more detailed usage.: invalid choice: 'interface' (choose from 'action', 'component', 'daemon', 'extension_points', 'extensions', 'launch', 'lifecycle', 'msg', 'multicast', 'node', 'param', 'pkg', 'run', 'security', 'service', 'srv', 'topic')

~$ ros2 msg show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
/opt/ros/eloquent/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ros2msg/verb/show.py:49: UserWarning: 'ros2 msg' is deprecated and will be removed in a future ROS release. Instead use: 'ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg'
  "'ros2 msg' is deprecated and will be removed in a future ROS release. "
# This expresses velocity in free space broken into its linear and angular parts.

Vector3  linear

Is there some missing package on my pc? or something I can do to be able to use the 'ros2 interface command'
Thanks in advance
edit1: added code in text form

Please do not (try to) post images of code or consoles (with error text). It's all text, so copy-paste it into your question.
Review the Support Guidelines, specifically the sections about not posting screenshots of code or console text.

Hello,
Eloquent is a future release, planned for Nov 22, 2019. So, the code-base might still be a work in progress.
I think this is one of the planned deprecation items in ROS2CLI.
(sorry meant to add a comment - not answer)

Tested it today and it worked, thanks

This is correct. ros2 interface is only available if you are using Eloquent or later.
