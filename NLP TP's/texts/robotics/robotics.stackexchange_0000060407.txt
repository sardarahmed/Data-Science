Q:

How can I call a native function from an android rosjava node?

Hi! I want to call a native function from my rosjava node which basically does some processing work and returns a variable of type double which is then finally published by the publisher. Can anyone please help me out?
Thanks.

The android documentation for the native function you're trying to call should probably tell you how to call it from Java.

A:

@Arjav this is a general Android question, so Android documentation is probably the best place to look for the answer,
Try starting here: https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/index.html. That should help you to bind a Java method to native code, and also to compile and link the native code into your app.
