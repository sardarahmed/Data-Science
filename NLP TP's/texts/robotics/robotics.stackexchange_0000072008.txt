Q:

ROS installation on Virtual Machine

Hello All,
I am a newbie to ROS and would like to get started with it. I have my computer with Windows 7 32 Bit OS. Would it be wise to install virtual machine and then to install Linux to have ROS platform for development or I should go on to buy a new computer with Linux as an OS to start with ROS. Basically, I do not want to invest in new computer until I get some expertise in ROS so was thinking to go with VM option.
What version of Linux and ROS would be best in my case?
Thanks

A:

Virtual machine is a good way to start learning ROS, avoids issues with linux and hardware issues as you first start. Ubuntu 14.04 with Indigo ROS is the current long term support combination.

So VMware is better?

@robtool There is a pre-built VM image from Nootrix with these LTS versions (Ubuntu 14.04 / ROS Indigo), so it may save you some time. If I am not mistaken, there is also ready to use catkin workspace in ~/catkin_ws.

It's your decision, based on the information you have given it would seem wise to spend some time using a VM to get an idea of using ROS. Only you can say when buying a dedicated machine is a good cost/benefit decision. Given that you can try vm for no outlay it seems to make sense as a first step

You could also install Linux alongside windows and create a dual boot machine rather than buy an additional machine, bit I would be inclined to try a vm first to see if any of the more complicated/expensive options are worth it.
