Q:

Hey guys, I installed ROS jade instead of ROS indigo and I keep getting the following error while installing the rosdep. Someone knows what to do?

martin94@ubuntu:~$ sudo rosdep init
ERROR: default sources list file already exists:
    /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list
Please delete if you wish to re-initialize

A:

you need to edit your .bashrc file and remove the line that is trying to source the jade script - it looks like you do have indigo installed as you, but looks like you have also have added that line to your .bashrc file
In terminal in your home folder gedit .bashrc will open it, scroll down to the bottom and remove the line that sources the jade file, leave in the one for indigo. Save changes
