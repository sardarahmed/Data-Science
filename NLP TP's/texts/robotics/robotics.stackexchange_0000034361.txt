Q:

prosilica calibration freezes during calibration step

I don't have any experience calibrating the prosilica camera on the PR2. I followed this tutorial but the calibration process tends to freeze up on me.
Setup:

PR2 is plugged into the basestation. Ran this whole process from the basestation as well.
v1.0.0 of pr2_calibration on the robot.

What I did:

Ran: roslaunch pr2_calibration_launch calibrate_prosilica.launch
Moved around the checkerboard until the 'Calibrate' button showed up.
Clicked on 'Calibrate'
Nothing happens for at least a half hour.....'top' tells me that the cameracalibration process takes %86 of the CPU.
I eventually kill it.

What am I doing wrong? Am I not waiting long enough?

A:

As it turns out, it just needed more time to run. I left it overnight and by the time I came in this morning it completed, and the 'save' and 'commit' buttons were displayed.
Lesson learned: Calibration can take a while. Be patient.

Yikes. For the record, camera_calibration has been significantly overhauled in ROS Electric, and should be much faster.
