Q:

Not able to find executables by using rosrun

I am following the tutorials and created the files named talker.cpp and listner.cpp according to tutorial 11 and also used rosedit to edit CMakeLists.txt.
But i am not able to find the executables in bin.
also $rosrun beginner_tutorials talker is not working.
the error is:
could not find executable named talker below /home/anand/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/beginner_tutorials
i have tried using rospack profile but was not useful.
I am new to ROS...please help as soon as possible.
I am using ros fuerte with rosbuild method in ubuntu 12.04 installed in virtualbox.

A:

Thanks a lot for replying.
The problem is solved now.
i forgot to put '}' at the end of talker.cpp due to which rosmake was giving failure error.
