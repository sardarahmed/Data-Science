Q:

CMake - Linking external C++ library

Hello,
I have an external .cpp library that requires both the following libraries: atlas, llpack and lblas
Now if for example, I compile using terminal (on the same machine) I can use the following:
g++ main.cpp hmm.cpp -I /usr/include/atlas -L /usr/lib64/atlas/ -llapack -lblas
This will work. I don't know how to include these libraries into the CMake list in ROS. I have, currently, the following:
rosbuild_add_executable(build1 src/hmm.c)

What would I have to add into my CMake list to make this work?
Thanks

A:

link_directories( /usr/lib64/atlas )

equivalent to -L /usr/lib64/atlas of gcc/g++
And after :
rosbuild_add_executable(build1 src/hmm.c)

you put
target_link_libraries( build1 lapack blas )

equivalent to -llapack -lblas
Note: First arg of target_link_libraries is the previously defined target to link.
Note: no prepended -l in target_link_libraries, i e. if your external lib is named libmy_lib.so you just add my_lib to target_link_libraries
