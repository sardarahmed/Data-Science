Q:

Autonomous Navigation Algorithm for Robot without know the map

Hi i want to ask something about the algorithm, can we navigate the robot without know the map first? (I use LIDAR)
I read about amcl, amcl is for estimate the robot, and amcl should know the map first, right?
There is any instruction that i should use ?
and what is the name of method/algorithm behind it?
like amcl is for adaptive monte carlo localization.
