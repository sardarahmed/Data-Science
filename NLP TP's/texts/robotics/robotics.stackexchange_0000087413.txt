Q:

What is colcon build?

I am trying to install ROS2 on windows and suddenly I see the build system has changed from ament build to colcon build. Is this an update ?
In my windows machine, when I call colcon build, it throws an error, the command "colcon" is either false or not found

A:

Yes, colcon is the new build tool replacing ament_tools as of the upcoming release ROS 2 Bouncy. You can find more information about it in the design article.
You will have to check / redo (part of) the instructions for setting up your machine which have been updated with steps to install colcon since you followed them.

@Dirk Thomas : If possible, kindly update the instructions as well as there isnt mentioned to download the colcon dependencies and it is extremely confusing.
