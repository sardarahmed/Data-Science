Q:

While rotating in place diff-drive-rotation package is losing orientation

Dear Ros Community,
I implemented diff-drive-controller package for my custom robot. I tested the generated odometry information while moving back and forward which works perfectly. However, while my robot is turning in place with a zero linear velocity and an angular velocity of 0.21, the generated odometry value moves faster than my robot. For example, when I rotate into 45 degree, my robot model rotates into 90 degree. I believe it is about slippage and there should be a slippage coefficient but I couldn't find something like that in the documentations. How does diff drive controller deals with in place rotations? What should I do for my robot?

A:

It seems there isn't a slippage value. My problem solved when I change the wheel_seperate distance. It was smaller than the real value. Thank you for this amazing package.
