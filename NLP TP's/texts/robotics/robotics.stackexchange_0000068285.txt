Q:

Create a new Ros Android application

I've installed  rosandroid (http://wiki.ros.org/android) and can run the sample applications/tutorials.
Now I want to create a new Android Studio Project and develop my own app. I found this tutorial here, but it doesn't work.
I executed these commands:
roscd android_core
cp -a android_tutorial_pubsub my_package

and added include "my_package" to android_core/settings.gradle
But when i  run this command:
./gradlew my_package:clean my_package:debug

I get the following Error:
    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/home/user/android_core/src/android_core/my_package/build.gradle' line: 18

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating project ':my_package'.
> Could not find method compile() for arguments [org.ros.rosjava_core:rosjava_tutorial_pubsub:[0.2,0.3)] on project ':my_package'.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED

Can somebody help me or post another tuorial for creating a new Android Project?

Not really. But you could copy "android_tutorial_pubsub" in your file explorer and rename it to something like "android_myrosandroidapp" and add 'include "android_myrosandroidapp"' to android_core/settings.gradle . After this you have to remove the unnecessary files manually in your IDE.

A:

Based on the article "Creating Android Packages" in the wiki I found a solution:
catkin_create_android_pkg android_foo android_core rosjava_core std_msgs
cd android_foo
catkin_create_android_project -t 10 -p com.github.ros_java.android_foo.bar bar
cd ../.. ; catkin_make

Finally add the following line to your file build.gradle:
dependencies {
    compile 'org.ros.android_core:android_10:[0.2,0.3)'
}
