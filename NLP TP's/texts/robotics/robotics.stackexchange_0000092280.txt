Q:

Colcon Tutorial on Dashing does not build

Ubuntu 18.04 running Dashing
on hash bafddbdb of master
The example from the Colcon Tutorial does not build.
https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial/
I kept getting errors like this from colcon :
Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"example_interfaces" with any of the following names:
example_interfacesConfig.cmake
example_interfaces-config.cmake_

I grepped through the commit logs of this repo and 64128033 seemed like the cause - so I cloned https://github.com/ros2/example_interfaces into  my src directory such that my filesystem was like this
---- src
-------- examples
--------  example_interfaces
and Cmake stopped complaining about an unknown dependency.
After that I got a build error on master, went to the dashing branch and got farther, but I kept getting more colcon errors, and after cloning the following three repos into my src directory colcon built for me
https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp
https://github.com/ros2/rcl_interfaces
https://github.com/ros2/test_interface_files
my final directory structure looked like this:
.
---- src
-------- examples
--------  example_interfaces
--------  rcl_interfaces
--------  test_interface_files
Did I miss a step in my install or is that tutorial lacking these steps?
Thanks

A:

It looks like you have not sourced the ROS2 SDK before building your new workspace: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial/#source-an-underlay
cd <path_to_ros2_ws>
source install/setup.sh

For the following errors, I think that you may have mixed different versions of SDK and examples repositories.
Ensure that both of them are up to date to the distribution that you are using (Dashing).
