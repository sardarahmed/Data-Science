Q:

Invalid point cloud from Kinect by using openni_camera

I recently upgraded my Ubuntu from Natty to Oneiric. Since we were developing a project under ros-electric, I thus upgraded the original ros-electric for Natty to ros-electric for Oneiric too. Unfortunately, now by using "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch", the point cloud data from Kinect all become "NaN" and no point cloud can be displayed in rviz, although rgb image display is fine. If I use "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch", normal point cloud can be displayed in rviz. Since we have to use openni_camera instead of openni_launch, I am wondering why openni_camera does not produce the right point cloud.

A:

Its probabliy a bug on openNi by ros. If you search here you find multiple people with the same problem.
I recomend to put a issue ticket on the github for openni, like this one (or add to this) : https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_camera/issues/13
