Q:

Best practice to write a ROS service for a serial-communication class with many options

I have been asked to write code to implement serial communications with a camera in order to control its pedestal (movable base) as well as set a few dozen other camera options. The catch is that I have to make it usable by ROS. 
What would be the best practice to implement this functionality in ROS? I understand  the concept of services, but I think that there should be a better way than creating a different service/file for each option.
Thanks,
Daniel.

A:

Why not write a subscription based node? It could take messages from whoever then passes the information on to the camera. From what you've said, it seems like a service wouldn't be necessary.  
Response. Yes. Create a new message that has all the necessary fields and a new topic, maybe /camera_parameters.
