Q:

Set maximum number of joint rotations per plan

I'm issuing my robot move commands in a way similar to this tutorial:
http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/pr2_moveit_tutorials/html/planning/scripts/doc/move_group_python_interface_tutorial.html
However, many of the plans it comes up with have unnecessary joint rotations. Is there to specify the maximum amount a joint can rotate for a planned path programmatically (ie no more than two full rotations or no more than 720 degrees movement in the joint during the plan execution)? If not, is there a way to set it manually?

Can you perhaps clarify a bit what you mean with 'unnecessary joint rotations'? I'm not saying your question is one, but just to avoid an xy-problem.
Comment by cvancleef on 2017-06-26:
For simple planned paths, the head of the robot will just keep rotating throughout the movement, where very little if any rotation looks like it would be needed. I don't know if it did it before I attached a new tool, but with the tool attached the rotation is extremely apparent.

I think its joint_6 of the lrmate200id rotating if that makes a difference. Also, in regards to the XY problem, I suppose that problem X would be that the planners are coming up with strange paths with unnecessary rotations and movements

You could use minimum and maximum values of the different joints inside the urdf file.

For the URDF, would that be 's  and  tags? That seems like what I'm looking for, although I'm not sure what "lower/upper joint limit" means
Comment by Felix_N on 2017-06-29:
Joint limits describe the "move-range" of your joint. lower/upper are similar to from/til. See code example below.

A:

As i mentioned above, one solution could be to use lower and upper limits inside your urdf file.
<joint name="articulated" type="revolute">
    <parent link="link1_rot"/>
    <child link="link2_lin"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <origin xyz ="0 0 0.05" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <limit effort="1000.0" lower="-1.5" upper="1.5" velocity="0.5"/>
</joint>

The joint "articulated", which connects link1_rot and link2_lin can now spin around the y-axis from -90 to +90 degrees.
