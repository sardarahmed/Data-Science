How to control kinect NUI Motor?

hello, i want to control my motor and change the direction of it. how can i doing it?
i've tried this one. but it doesn't work. i failed compile it, and failed run the .exe program. said that

KinectMotor.cpp:2:19: fatal error: XnUSB.h: No such file or directory
#include <XnUSB.h>

so, is there any option to do it with ROS?
i've heard there's something called kinect_aux package.
but, i don't have those package in openni_launch or openn_camera or libfreenect or blabla.
where can i find it?
Thank's for help !
