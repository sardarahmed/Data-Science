Q:

Getting android_tutorial_pubsub connected to the roscore on PC (crash)

I am trying to modify the android_tutorial_pubsub to let it connect to the roscore on computer so I can establish communications between them. I successfully build the tutorial and I am able to see the "Hello world n" on screen. However, the tutorial is building its own roscore in the phone by default, so I tried to find some solutions to modify it and I found a patch file.
(http://ias.in.tum.de/~moesenle/android_tutorial_pubsub.patch).
After changing my code manually, it is compiled within eclipse IDE successfully. However, when the app launches on the phone, after I enter the http://localhost:11311/ and click OK, it crashes. It gives the following error in the log cat.
FATAL EXCEPTION: pool-1-thread-1. I tried to debug the app but failed.
I hope that anyone could help me. Thanks.

A:

If you use Lorenz's patch, then you need to actually start a master at the URI that you specify. If you're connecting to the roscore on a PC on the network, you need to put in that URI and not "localhost".
When I run Lorenz's patch with the URI set to localhost, it doesn't crash, but it also doesn't do anything. This is expected, since I'm not running a roscore on the tablet.
