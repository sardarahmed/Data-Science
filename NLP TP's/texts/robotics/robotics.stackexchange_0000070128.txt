Q:

How to substitute TF2 prefix

Hi,
I have seen that tf_prefix support is deprecated in TF2. What is the proper way now of having the same functionality? That is, I have two robots, robot1 and robot2, and I want the TF frames to append these names to their corresponding base_links. How should I properly do it?
EDIT: Also, what is the meaning then of the tf_prefix parameter of the robot_state_publisher node? Is that the way to proceed with all the other nodes using TF frames (parameters and manually concatenating in the nodes)?
Thank you!

A:

Despite the deprecation warning, tf_prefix still works and there is still no alternative solution.
My guess is that ROS 1 will continue to support tf_prefix indefinitely, but we should ask for an opinion from @tfoote about that.
The deprecation may happen in ROS 2, but it is still too early in that design cycle to tell.

Thanks for the answer. For completeness: tf2 migration page However tf will continue to be supported for through at least J Turtle. Actually I do not get any warning, is just me trying to do things correctly.
