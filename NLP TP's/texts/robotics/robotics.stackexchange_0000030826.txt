Q:

Moving a robot in Gazebo

I'm trying to use the gazebo package to simulate a simple car-like robot moving around a field. Currently, I've been able to load a model of my robot into a simulation. However, I haven't had any luck understanding how to go about making the robot move via external commands (keyboard presses, etc.).
The documentation seems to gloss over this, or at least I can't find where it's described. How would I go about making a robot move in the a Gazebo simulation?

A:

You can write a gazebo plugin to send torque or velocity commands to each wheel and the steering joint.  Possibly wrapping a simple PID controller around each controlled joint.  An empty gazebo_plugin template has been provided for your convenience.  Also, please take a look at the diffdrive example for reference on how to construct a plugin that sends velocity commands to individual joints.
Alternatively, if you are familiar with pr2_mechanism control stacks, you can use some predefined robot mechanism controllers to control your joints.  A simple controlled joint example can be found in the single link example as shown here.

The Link for empty gazebo plugin template doesn't work.
