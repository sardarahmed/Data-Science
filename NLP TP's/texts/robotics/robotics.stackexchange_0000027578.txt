Q:

Perform one simulation step

Hello everyone!
I'm want to interface ROS and Gazebo to perform a robot control task.
However, I want to have full control of the simulation evolution, by arbitrating the simulation steps.
To be more specific, I publish a simulation clock in ROS and then:
I want to tell Gazebo to execute the next simulation step, gather data, perform calculations over them and publish control outputs for the next simulation steps.
Afterwards, run the next simulation step and start over.
I found this question, but it is outdated and with broken links.
Is there anything more recent on this topic?
Thanks,
George

Hi there,
as @scpeters mentioned in the other question you could publish gazebo world_control messages on the ~/world_control topic. You start the simulation paused and you send a message with step = true to step once in the simulation.
Cheers,
Andrei
