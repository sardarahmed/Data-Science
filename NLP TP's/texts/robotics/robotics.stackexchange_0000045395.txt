Q:

costmap creation

I would like to create a map of my environment.
I don't want to use gmap because I have yet a plan of the environment.
How can I convert my jgpeg in a ros map that I can see in rviz?

A:

You need to run map_server with your map. For that, it's best to write a yaml file with your map's metadata and convert your jpeg to something the map server can handle, for instance pnm. Have a look at the map_server wiki page. Note that since jpeg is not a lossless compression format, your map might not be perfect anymore, i.e. the colors at the edges of obstacles might be wrong.
