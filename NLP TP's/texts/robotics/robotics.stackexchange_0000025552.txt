Q:

When will Gazebo be catkin-ized in ROS?

In ROS Groovy, the Gazebo debian is still currently using rosbuild, and the Gazebo installation instructions say that ROS users should not install from source. Additionally, Gazebo for ROS is still on version 1.2 instead of 1.3. The reason I need Gazebo to be catkinized is because I tried following your animate joint tutorial and CMake can't find Gazebo. I assume that is because Gazebo on my computer is installed here:

/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/share/gazebo-1.2/

I tried sourcing the setup.sh in the above folder but it didn't help CMake. I also tried catkinizing the animate joint tutorial but realized it wouldn't work because Gazebo is still a dry package.

A:

Gazebo is a standalone package. ROS will eventually use our binary installation. So, Gazebo won't be catkin-ized because it's not a ROS package or stack.
The proper way to use Gazebo is to install the standalone version of Gazebo, and use pkg-config to find it.

This seems to run counter to what this website says: "ROS Users: Never install Gazebo from here. Use these instructions." On this page: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.2/install

dave, this changed with version 1.3. The installation instructions for that version state what nate posted. I found that quite confusing, so I've asked for recommendations for ros users here: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/782/recommended-way-of-using-gazebo-with-ros-groovy/

Gazebo 1.3 install instructions are correct.
