Q:

Why is this electro motor going slower?

From an old dust buster I've got this electro motor, the included battery pack and the charger:

I ripped everything apart (the dust buster was broken) and the motor still works. After playing around with it for a while and letting it lying around for about two weeks it suddenly revs a lot slower. I supposed the battery pack was drained so I hooked up the battery pack to the charger and let it charge for a night. Unfortunately the motor still turns very slow.
Since I want to use this motor for my first home robotics project (making a kite fly with my computer), off I went to the local electronics store where they measured the charger to give 16V (even though it says 21V) and the battery pack to give about 5V. I then hooked up the motor directly to the charger, but unfortunately it doesn't even move an inch then.
So now I wonder:

Why doesn't the motor spin at all when hooking it up to the charger? (Could that be because the 250mA is too low?)
Why doesn't the battery pack charge at all? (this bothers me the most!)

All tips are welcome!

A:

250mA states the maximum output current to drive the load. So check what the current rating of the 5V regulator is.
Check whether there is a voltage drop before reaching the motor. It might be that the motor is not spinning because of insufficient supply.
Change the adapter you are using. If it is marked 21V, the output from adapter will be around 20.5V to 21.5V.
