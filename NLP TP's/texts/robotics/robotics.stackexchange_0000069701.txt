Q:

Is there a way to communicate ROS with a controller IRC-5?

Hi,
I'm working currently with ROS-I, RVIZ and a industrial from ABB, the IRB-140. I have read that you can controller it using the robot ABB's Package from ROS-industrial and ROBOTSTUDIO in a WIndows PC; however, I'm asking me if you can controllet it directly from ROS without use ROBOTSTUDIO.
Thanks for your answers.

Could you point me (link) to where you read that you would need RobotStudio to use the ABB packages?

A:

I have read that you can controller it using the robot ABB's Package from ROS-industrial and ROBOTSTUDIO in a WIndows PC [..]

There is no need for RobotStudio whatsoever to use the ROS-Industrial ABB packages, unless you want to control simulated hardware (ie: robots).
The abb_driver and other packages are designed to be used with ABB controllers, whether simulated or real.

[..] I'm asking me if you can controllet it directly from ROS without use ROBOTSTUDIO

So: yes.

@gvdhoorn Aaa ok, so you are able to send paths or trajectories(i.e Moveit) from rviz. Sorry, i'm new in ROS and i can't get all this concepts yet.
It is the link I was following,
http://wiki.ros.org/abb/Tutorials
and currently i'm creating the urdf for this robot.

The tutorials you linked just show you that it is possible to run the abb_driver on a controller simulated in RobotStudio, nowhere is it stated that you need it?
And yes: install the rapid code on the ctrlr, start the abb_driver nodes and use the FollowJointTrajectoryAction server.

See How do we transmit trajectories to our ABB IRB 140 using the ABB Package for some info on how to add support for new robot models / variants.

thanks so much, i hope in the next two weeks have an advance on it.
