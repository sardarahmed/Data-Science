Q:

How could I make my UR5 in rviz mimic the real robot?

Hi all,
My lab partner is controlling a couple of UR5 with our own nodes; so, i'd like to mimic them in rviz.
I guess I have to use robot_state_publisher; but I think that I should create a new node with the kinematic chain ,since I only have the TCP, which launch the jointstates mesagges.
But, Could I use the joint_states_publisher to simplify my work?
Thanks all.

A:

Although the universal_robot stack also allows you to control the UR5 from ROS, you should be able to use it to just report state as well. It is part of the ROS-Industrial program.

Sorry gdvhoorn, but I am New in ROS and C++; Would I need a new program, implement by myself, for sending the jointstates messages from my UR5 or there is a specific node for this aim?
If I had to do this program, how do I find the kinematic chain and which messages need robot_state_publisher?
Have I to send this messages for joint_state_publisher before?

For just state reporting, it should be enough to install the universal_robot stack and use the already available programs and launch files. Anything else would require you to create something new (or extend something that already exists).
