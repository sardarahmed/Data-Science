Q:

launch error for kinect openni

Hi
I installed openni_kinect package and tried the launch command i'm not getting output. when i opened rviz i got the topics i selected them and changed to grey background according to the steps in openni_launch in ros, status for point cloud2 is warning and it says no messages received and [0] points from [0] messages.
when i opened launch command i got the following 2 errors:

A:

I also get these errors, but still things work out.
You shouldn't run things as "root", but this is likely not the solution. Check wether data is sent on the topic:
rostopic hz /camera/depth_registered/points

If so, the reason is most probably your rviz settings (correct frame_id chosen? try "/camera_link")

when i gave rostopic hz /camera/depth_registered/points i got nothing. what is the problem.i didn't run in root this time. i changed to camera_link still nothing.wht to do
Comment by Felix Endres on 2012-04-18:
Try using (rosrun) dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui. You can set the openni_driver explicitly to "registered". Or you could try openni_camera, the previous kinect driver.
Comment by priya on 2012-04-18:
i tried registration steps given in openni_launch webpage even then no image,can u tell how to set openni_driver explicitly to registered i don't see any info on tht. i'm using electric so openni_camera is within the openni_kinect nd dunno how to get image using openni_cam pkg no webpage info too.
Comment by priya on 2012-04-18:
for the registration i'm not able to set the color transformer to RGB8, it doesn't show any option.
Comment by priya on 2012-04-18:
or is it because of the camera calibration warnings as u can see from my question above?
Comment by priya on 2012-04-19:
i got the output...i kept trying...i got it....thanx :)
