Q:

move base for omni?

Hello i am trying to control the omni or mechanum wheels with the move base for autonomous navigation. But as i saw that move base only suppports the diff drive wheels.
Is it possible to use move base anyhow to use for this type of robots also? Or has anyone modified the move base for such robots?

A:

I've never controlled it with an Omni, but it's probably possible.
You should be able to set the local planner of move_base to an omni-controllable planner. Set it in base_local_planner  of move_base.
A candidate local planner to set is dwa_local_planner, which is included in the navigation stack. It has a setting for y-axis control. acc_lim_y, max_vel_y, min_vel_y, vy_samples.
Also, if you are using amcl for self-position estimation, changing odom_model_type to omni may improve the accuracy of self-position estimation.
