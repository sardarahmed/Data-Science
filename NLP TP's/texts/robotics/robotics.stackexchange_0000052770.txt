Q:

how to edit CMakeLists.txt with my program using package "create_node"?

my program will use the package: create_node,
my cpp file: #include <create_mode/TurtlebotSebsorState.h>
I think I need edit CMakeLists.txt to let catkin know i will use it
but i don't know what place I need write it and what should I write
is it in #Build# tag? or other place ?
===================
big thanks tbh for point the typo and help me :)
after I tried add create_node to find_package and catkin_package like this:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS create_node roscpp rospy std_msgs)

catkin_package(
   INCLUDE_DIRS include
   CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp rospy std_msgs create_node)

when I use command catkin_make , it's the error message:
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'bump_sensor'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(bump_sensor)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package create_node.

  Set create_node_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
  for create_node.  The file will have one of the following names:

    create_nodeConfig.cmake
    create_node-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  bump_sensor/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package)

-- +++ processing catkin package: 'movement'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(movement)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

is it means can not find the package create_node?
or my CMakeLists.txt still not complete ? :/

What version of create_node are you using? How did you install it? The master branch of https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_create still uses rosbuild. The hydro-devel branch appears to use catkin.

I am using groovy version

A:

A catkin package may not depend on a rosbuild one.
Since you are using Groovy, and that create_node release still uses rosbuild, your catkin package cannot refer to it. In Hydro that will probably work. Meanwhile, you'll need to maintain your program in a rosbuild package.
