Q:

just copying catkin_ws/src from other,and catkin_make causes 'can't find *.h'

I built new system for computer A, so I copied my working version of catkin_ws/src from the computer B. during the copying process, i occluded src/CMakeList.txt, i did 'catkin_init_workspace' to make new CMakeList.txt for the new system. After simple copying the files, i did first catkin_make, source /devel/setup.sh, installing all required dependency.
A, B both have same OS(ubuntu vivid) and same ROS(jade), So i didn't expected issues.
But when i do 'catkin_make' it cause below messages which said that it can't find header file. What can cause this kind of issue? if i want to move source file, should i care more than simply copying file?

Are your workspaces in the same location on both machines? If not, CMake caches could be retaining incorrect information. It's probably a good idea to delete the build/, devel/, and install/ directories in the workspace on the new machine. Then source the jade setup.bash and run catkin_make.

A:

It looks to me like a custom message isn't being built.  Check to make sure that your IOWrapper package CMakeLists.txt has a dependency on lsd_slam_viewer_generate_messages_cpp.  Here is another question that explains how to properly build messages from separate packages.
