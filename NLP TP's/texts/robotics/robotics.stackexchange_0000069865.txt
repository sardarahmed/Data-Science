Q:

collecting and organizing rosbag files

Recording rosbag files is great. After multiple recording sessions, I'm left with all these bag files that are really only telling me date/time by direct observation. I can do rosbag info to get more details. I was wondering if anyone had a best practice for collecting, storing, and organizing rosbag files. I'm thinking of a database containing rosbag files with additional metadata including some text field for a description of what was recorded.
Maybe this problem has already been solved.
Thanks in advance.

It looks like BotBags no longer exists, but maybe https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz is suitable (not sure if it plays back bag files that are local or online)?
