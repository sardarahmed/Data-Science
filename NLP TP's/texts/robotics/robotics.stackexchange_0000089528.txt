I'm trying to setup workspace for moveit. I'm following the steps mentioned in below link.
Tutorial steps:-  http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html#install-ros-and-catkin
I'm receiving the below error when i run the catkin build.
Error - 
error: ‘class moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface’ has no member named ‘getJointModelGroupNames’
   std::copy(move_group.getJointModelGroupNames().begin(), move_group.getJointModelGroupNames().end(),

I have followed every step from those tutorial and i have no idea how can i solve this error.
any kind of help is appreciated.

I got same errors too ...

A:

installing moveit from source and then building solves this problem.
After building (approx 27 packages) you can clone the tutorials in the src folder of your workspace and run catkin build again.
