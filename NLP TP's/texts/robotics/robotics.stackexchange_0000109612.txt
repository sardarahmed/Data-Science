Q:

ROS2 Mixing DDS / Middleware Between Nodes

Looking to understand the limits of ROS2 right now so I can architect my system better. Is it possible to run different DDS implementations on different nodes (e.g. fast-dds and cyclone-dds) or will this cause issues with topics and services? My main reason for asking is the use-case where I am communicating with an existing system that is running a different DDS than the one I have configured.

A:

I have been working on a robot which is running fastrtps while all stuff on my side is running cyclonedds. From my experience I can say that with default configs on the cyclone (not certain if the fastrtps is running with defaults...) topics seem to work quite ok. Services were something I was not able to make work properly (cyclone -> fastrtps).
A while back I had problems (and again having some, not sure yet what it is this time...). Last time my problems were somehow related to a cyclonedds config that I was setting. As soon as I removed the config the connection began to work again. In the configs we were mainly setting the multicast to spdp
So it can work but it can be quite finicky. As disclaimer I would say that I am not a dds wizard. Maybe there is some configs which can be tweaked to make those work better together. This has been my experience on the topic so far.
