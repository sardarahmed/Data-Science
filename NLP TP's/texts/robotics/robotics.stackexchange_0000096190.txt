Q:

Error running Turtlesim noetic

Good Afternoon All,
I am going through the tutorial at : http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes.  I ran the command :
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node  and it generated the error :
/opt/ros/noetic/lib/turtlesim/turtlesim_node: error while loading shared libraries: libQt5Core.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
I verified that  libQt5Core.so.5 is installed, and idea on how to resolve?  Please advise?
Regards,

This doesn't seem to be an issue with ROS, but rather with your system. See here for example. If that doesn't help, can you provide system details?

Im trying to install ros/gazebo using WSL in ubuntu 20.4 and getting the same error. any clue to fix this?

A:

Hello,
I have solved the same problem.
Maybe this problem is due to the version of WSL in ubuntu 20.04.
To solve this problem, refer to this URL:
link text
whereis libQt5Core.so.5
# copy that address
sudo strip --remove-section=.note.ABI-tag /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5

Good Luck.
