Q:

rclpy.action.ActionServer callback 'goal_handle' type

Hi,
When opening an action server it looks something like this:
self.move_up_action_server = ActionServer(self, MoveVerticalAction, 'move_vertical', self.move_up_callback)

With the callback being:
def move_up_callback(self, goal_handle):

I couldn't find anywhere what is the type of goal_handle.
Seems like it has goal_handle.request, goal_handle.publish_feedback, goal_handle.succeed. Maybe some of you know what is the python type I should use?Thanks

A:

Ok I realized I was stupid.
I just used python's type() and found out it is rclpy.action.server.ServerGoalHandle.
Problem solved.
