Q:

Time needed for complete urdf model?

Hi,
I would like to make a URDF model of a robot to simulate it in Gazebo.
However, it seems like a lot of work to do this model from scratch. I know that there a very good tutorial exists, but is there like a database of existing URDF models from which we could start with? I know about the erratic and the PR2 robot, are thee some others?
Also, from your point of view, how much time of work is needed to make a complete model of a robot with 4 wheels, 1 arm, 1 camera, 1 Hokuyo, some bumper sensors and some infrared sensors?
Thank you so much for your precious help,
Regards,
Morgan
