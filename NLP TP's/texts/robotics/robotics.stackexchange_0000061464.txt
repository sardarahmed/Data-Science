Q:

[hydro] Error in move_base.launch

When I launch my move_base.launch, ( http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup ) , I got this error :
Trajectory Rollout planner initialized with param meter_scoring not set. Set it to true to make your settins robust against changes of costmap resolution

This is my base_local_planner.yaml file
TrajectoryPlannerROS:
  max_vel_x: 0.01 #0.45
  min_vel_x: 0.005
  max_rotational_vel: 0.02 #1.0
  min_in_place_rotational_vel: 0.002 #0.4
  
  acc_lim_th: 0.01 #0.06 #3.2
  acc_lim_x: 0.01 #0.05 #2.5
  acc_lim_y: 0.5 #2.5

  holonomic_robot: false
  dwa: true

A:

To get rid of that message you should set the parameter meter_scoring to either true or false, depending on your preferences. At the end of your base_local_planner.yaml add:
meter_scoring: true

or
meter_scoring: false

It is recommended to use meter scoring (meter_scoring: true) when you expect that the resolution of your map might change.
