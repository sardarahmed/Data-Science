Q:

how stable is indigo?

our team is currently using hydro, with most of our code in python 2.7 and some c++.
we're considering upgrading to indigo.
how is everone's experience with indigo so far?  is it stable?
we were just concerned that the upgrade will cause us any issues (i.e. compatible, stable, etc) that may delay our development.
would love to hear everyone's thought.

A:

I haven't used Indigo on a robot yet. The migration guide documents most of the breaking changes between Hydro and Indigo: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Migration . There aren't very many of them, and they're mostly just removing features that were deprecated in Hydro.
