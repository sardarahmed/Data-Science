Q:

ROS-I on melodic (ROS-Industrial)

Hi everyone,
Does anyone have an idea of when ROS-I will be officially released for Melodic? I would really like to start migrating the support packages.

A:

There currently isn't a planning/roadmap for this, but work has been started. See ros-industrial/ros_industrial_issues#59.

I would really like to start migrating the support packages.

Can you describe what it is that would need migration? The support pkgs typically only contain some meshes, a xacro and some launch files, which wouldn't seem to require migration at this point.

Last time i tried to work with the support packages of staubli (early november 2018), they did not work with ROS Melodic.
It could have also been an error in the ROS-Industrial core package, which I built from source back then.
So are you saying all support packages should be compatible in the new

I can't say without knowing the error you mention.
ros-industrial/industrial_core#204 should allow building industrial_core on Melodic (Travis defaults to it).

Thank you. Will try that again.
