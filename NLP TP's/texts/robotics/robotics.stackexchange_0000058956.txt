Hello.

In order to do that, first check the "openni" tutorial.
This tutorial demonstrates how to open a Kinect in ROS, introduces ROS tools for visualization and configuration, etc:
http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch/Tutorials/QuickStart

Then, also check how to use a bridge between the kinect image topic and Opencv.
This tutorial describes how to interface ROS and OpenCV by converting ROS images into OpenCV images, and vice versa, using cv_bridge. Included is a sample node that can be used as a template for your own node:
http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge/Tutorials/ConvertingBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImagesPython

Read the OpenCV documentation on how to recognize faces:
http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/index.html
http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/tutorial/facerec_video_recognition.html

Try some example that you can found on the web, like this (I haven't tried it):
https://code.google.com/p/ros-by-example/source/browse/trunk/rbx_vol_1/rbx1_vision/nodes/face_detector.py?r=116

I hope this links can help you, good luck!
