A:

On Ubuntu at least, you should be able to install the navigation_stage package through apt. First, follow the ROS Installation Instructions.
Next, you should be able to run a simple "sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-navigation-tutorials" to install the navigation_tutorials stack which includes the navigation_stage package.
If you're not running Ubuntu, you'll want to use rosinstall or mercurial directly to pull the navigation_tutorials package from https://kforge.ros.org/navigation/tutorials.
After this, it should just be a matter of running move_base_multi_robot.launch to see an example of navigation with multiple robots.
Hope this helps.
