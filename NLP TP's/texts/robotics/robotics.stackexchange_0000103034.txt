Q:

using usb_cam from remote computer. Cannot identify '/dev/video0': 2, No such file or directory

Hello everyone!
My configuration is the following:

ROS-master computer: Nvidia TX2 with Ubuntu 18.04, ROS melodic and package usb_cam installed on it
, and Logitech USB camera connected to it through the USB port

The computer which I try to start the command  roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch from:
Ubuntu 18.04

I've found one similar question on this forum: #q284015.
But my problem is a little bit different because my configuration includes 2 computers.
Here is the situation:
I ssh on board computer (Nvidia TX2 with Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS melodic) and start roscore on it
and after that start this command on my computer:
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch

So, ROS-Master is different computer from the one where I start the command.
But I don't have any issues with connecting to ROS-master.
And roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch works perfectly fine, when I do it locally, on Nvidia TX2 which is ROS-master computer.
I have an error when I try to run it on my laptop which isn't ROS-master and after the following command:
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch

I have this error message:
[ERROR] [1676393342.653244327]: Cannot identify '/dev/video0': 2, No such file or directory
[usb_cam-1] process has died [pid 3741, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/melodic/lib/usb_cam/usb_cam_node __name:=usb_cam __log:=/....log

I can see /dev/video0 device on my ROS-master computer, so, the device totally exists and, as I mentioned above, I can run this command locally on the ROS-master computer, the problem is only with running the command from the remote computer.
Looks like some problem with the permission of the remote user, but I don't understand how to add permission for the remote user:

Try adding yourself to the user group
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

Mean, this advice looks like something which can help me, but I don't understand how to apply it for the remote user/computer
Thanks in advance!

A:

Are you trying to start a .launch file which requires a usb camera on a PC which doesn't have the camera connected?
If that's the case, the problem would not be permissions, but the fact the camera is connected to the other device/PC.

Ops, that is exactly what I am trying to do. Thank you, I didn't know that this launch file can be run only locally (on ROS-master PC).
But then, how, using usb_cam package can I see a camera picture on the remote laptop which has access to the ROS-master PC with a connected USB camera to it?

Start image_view (or whatever you want to use to see the sensor_msgs/Image stream) on your laptop after starting the .launch file which starts usb_cam on the host with the camera?
ROS is networked/distributed by default. You just have to configure it correctly.

Thank you so much! That is what I was looking for. Just checked it on my setup - it works. Thanks again!
