Q:

rqt install in Fuerte / git target directories

Dear Ros experts!
I want to install the rqt Package to my fuerte ROS version in ubuntu precise.
I am following the instructions on
see wiki.ros.org/rqt/UserGuide/Install/Groovy
(At the end of the page)
Then I have problems with the sentence:
"Clone the git repositories qt_gui_core and rqt"
As far as I know to clone a git repository you need to specify the target directory.
The question:
what is the target directory where to clone the git rqt and qt_gui_core repository?
I am really new in ROS so I hope the question makes sense if not just tell me what I am not understanding.
THANK YOU!

My question is quite similar to the one on this link
http://answers.ros.org/question/66255/install-rqt-on-fuerte-from-source-help/
I think we both stumbled upon the same problem:
'The instructions to install rqt on Fuerte are not detailed enough for beginners'. Please fix it or answer the question.

A:

On the one hand it is sad that I have to answer my own question ( could no body help me for such long time? :_( ) on the other hand it is nice to see that I have learnt something in ROS! ;-)
The direct answer to the question is:
clone the repository on your personal ROS workspace
You should have one already created (this personal workspace is also called overlay). If you followed the ROS installation instructions of configuring a new environment, Create a ROS workspace, you should have already one personal workspace where to install the packages.
In my case it is /work/<user>/ros_fuerte_workspace.
And what you should actually do in your workspace is just install rqt as a new package. (There is a general answer about installing a package here ) I will give you the particular installation method using a rosinstall file. Therefore I will provide you as well with the rosinstall file rqt.rosinstall that you must execute in your personal workspace with the following command
(there is an important dot in the middle of the expression!)
rosinstall . rqt.rosinstall

That is the code that I you should write in the file rqt.rosinstall
#installing rqt
#Two stacks needed 'qt_gui_core' and 'rqt'
#see http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/UserGuide/Install/Groovy last Headline "Installing on Fuerte"

- git: {local-name: qt_gui_core, uri:  'https://github.com/ros-visualization/qt_gui_core.git', version: fuerte-devel}

- git: {local-name: rqt, uri: 'https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt.git', version: fuerte-devel}

The # lines are comments, you may leave them out (but I would keep them comments are good ;-))
On executing rosinstall on this file the subfolders rqt  and qt_gui_core are created. Now you just gotta build them! (Go inside each of them and run rosmake)
rosmake

READY!! now you can use rqt on fuerte by writing:
rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui

Hallelujah! :-)

I'm glad you were able to learn yourself and solve your problem. This is a very important skill. Sorry that nobody was able to give you hints. It probably slipped the radar.

And thank you for coming back to provide the answer yourself.

Hey thanks for your encouragement. After so long waiting for the answer I could not keep it for myself!
And at the end I even got a 'self-learner badge' ;-)
