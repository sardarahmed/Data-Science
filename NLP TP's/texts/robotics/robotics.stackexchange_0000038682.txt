A:

Just taking a quick look at the code, it seems like you could probably switch the header to the one included in the package, that is:
Change:
#include <libtimer/timer.h>

To:
#include "kinect_utils/timer.h"

Or, you could probably remove the timer code and header, as it seems to be used for profiling purposes only.  It wouldn't be necessary to actually run the code, just determine the timing of the code.
