Q:

Does turtlebot works on Kubuntu?

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to install Turtlebot on a netbook that uses Kubuntu 10.04.
But i couldn't find the Meta Package for turtlebot-robot via Synaptic neither by apt-cache search...
Is possible to run turtlebot on Kubuntu? And how can I to install it?
Thanks,
Lucas
