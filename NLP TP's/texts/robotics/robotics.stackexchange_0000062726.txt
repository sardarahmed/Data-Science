Q:

'rospack' tries to load libboost_filesystem.so.1.46.1 in Ubuntu 14.04

I have Ubuntu 14.04, and installed ROS Indigo using the steps documented here, but auto-completion using  for $ roscd <package_name> gives the following error:
rospack: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_filesystem.so.1.46.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
rosstack: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_filesystem.so.1.46.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
So, I purged everything (boost and ROS) and re-installed ROS, with the exactly same results as above

Installed Boost version: 1.54.0-4ubuntu3.1  (via dpkg)
Installed rospack version:  2.2.5-0trusty-20140904-1937-+0000 (via dpkg)

Any ideas why?

Can you check which version of rospack you are calling (which rospack)? And which version of rospack and boost you have installed (dpkg -l | grep rospack, dpkg -l | grep boost)?

which rospack?

/opt/ros/indigo/bin/rospack

Please run ldd /opt/ros/indigo/bin/rospack and post the line listing the boost filesystem library. Please run ll /PATH/TO/libboost_filesystem.so.VERSION to double check that it is not a symlink to an older version.

Hi all those who might face the problem.
I resolved the problem by:

removing the /opt/ros directory, uninstalling ros-indigo-desktop-full and re-installing it.

Now everything's peachy.
