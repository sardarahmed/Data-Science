Q:

How to add a new ROS core package without new build of all core package?

I need to build the ROS from the source on Rasbian Buster (R-Pi 4). I followed the instructions from this site.
First I installed the desktop core version with these steps:
rosinstall_generator desktop --rosdistro melodic --deps --tar > melodic-desktop.rosinstall
wstool init -j8 src melodic-desktop-wet.rosinstall
wstool update -j 4 -t src

It works. However, now I need several other packages, such as tf2_eigen. I check the instruction from https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Source. Then, I execute
rosinstall_generator desktop_full --rosdistro melodic --deps --tar > melodic-desktop-full.rosinstall

to see the entries of the tf2_eigen. I inserted the tf2_eigen entry to the file melodic-desktop.rosinstall, that I created for the first time.
Then, I did
wstool merge -t src  melodic-desktop.rosinstall

to merge the new entry, and wstool update -j 4 -t src.
However, after I run this command
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/melodic -j2

to build the tf2_eigen, the command catkin_make_isolated build everything again in the src folder. I costs me two hours to build all the core packages again. How can I build the tf2_eigen only, without building everything again?

A:

I've got a couple of ideas:

Download the ros packages with apt-get, so that you don't have to compile them from source
catkin_make_isolated has several arguments to specify which packages should get build (for example --pkg)
Create an overlay workspace with only your package, this way you only have to build your underlay workspace once: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying

The first idea is not possible, since there is currently no ros-melodic package for raspbian buster.
What is overlay workspace? What should I do? If the overlay workspace refers to a new paralel workspace folder, it is not my option. I don't want to have several ros-core workspaces, since I have already several project workspace.
The second idea is the suitable solution for me. Thanks @Rayman!

I've added a link to the overlay workspace tutorial. An overlay workspace adds packages on top of another workspace. This way you can chain two (or more) workspace and prevent recompiling everything. I hope it helps you.
