Q:

which Nav2 topic message changes when reached the goal?

Hello,
I am using ROS2 humble navigation2 package.
I am now trying to check if the robot reached the goal by monitoring a specific topic.
I found out that the length of message which goes to  /plan topic reduces as it gets closer to the target goal.
But I'd like to ask if there's better way to find out whether it reached a goal or not. Thank you!

A:

You should be using Nav2's action interface to request navigation commands which will provide you with feedback and ultimately a result once navigation is complete. You should not be monitoring topics or hacking into action server's internal topics.
