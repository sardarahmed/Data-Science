Q:

actionlib ImportError for python

Hi folks, ROS noob here. For some reason I get an ImportError for actionlib with the following:
#!/usr/bin/env python

import cv
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('robot_red')
import rospy
import actionlib
#rest of code...

which results in "ImportError: No module named actionlib" in the terminal. If anyone can describe what the problem might be I'll be eternally grateful. Thanks!

I can just create package and run this code without problems. Does that means something you haven't installed?

@sam Thx for the input. I think the files for actionlib itself are already installed under opt/ros/electric/stacks/common/actionlib (assuming those are the files) but python/ros isn't finding them. No idea why.

A:

Check your manifest.xml file in robot_red package whether it contains the dependancy on actionlib
<package>
....
   <depend package="actionlib" />
...
</package>
