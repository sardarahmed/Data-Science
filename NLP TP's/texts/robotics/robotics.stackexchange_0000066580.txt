Q:

Can not install eros successfully

Hello,I want to cross-compile ROS for ARM.I am trying to use eros according to http://wiki.ros.org/eros/Installation. When I run $ rosinstall /opt/ros eros_diamondback.rosinstall       It shows：ERROR in config：Is not a local file,nor a valid URL [eros_diamondback.rosinstall]:unknown url type:eros_diamondback.rosinstall
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/eros/tags/diamondback ./eros

It also can not install successfully . Is the eros discarded?

A:

The eros project has long since been abandoned, and ROS DiamondBack has been EOL for many years now.
Depending on your platform, you have several options to use ROS on ARM devices: you could follow the indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM install guide, or the BeagleBone and/or the bmwcarit/meta-ros (using OpenEmbedded) or attempt a from-source cross-compile yourself.
If at all possible, I'd use the pre-built debians and Ubuntu for ARM, as it reduces the effort required to get ROS on ARM significantly. Of course, whether you can do this depends on your actual hardware.
