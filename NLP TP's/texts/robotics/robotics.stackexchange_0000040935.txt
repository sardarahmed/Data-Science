Q:

Rosinstall fails for openni drivers

I use Ubuntu 11.10 and I try to communicate to a Kinect sensor (the kinect is connected). I followed the instruction from http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect and get some problems.
cd openni && make
make[1]:Entering directory '/root/drivers/openni'
git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git build/openni
Cloning into build/openni...
remote: Counting objects: 4866, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2064/2064), done.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly MiB | 1 kiB/s
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed
make[1]: ***[build/openni] Error 128
make[1]: Leaving directory '/root/drivers/openni'
make: *** [openni_lib] Error 2

A:

That looks like GitHub had a hiccup or your network connection.  It should work when the issues is resolved.  And as @Mac says it's recommended to use the binary installs when possible.
