When will ros.org be back up?

The main website/wiki, code.ros.org, and willowgarage.com all seem to be down.

A:

The short answer: yes, they will be back up.
In the meantime, here's a mirror: http://ros.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/roswiki/
You can also set up your own mirror. Just follow this answer(you won't be able to do so while the main site is down though).
