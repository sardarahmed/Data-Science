Does microstrain_3dmgx2_imu work with the 3DM-GX4-25?

Does the microstrain_3dmgx2_imu driver work for the Microstrain 3DM-GX4-25?

A:

No.  I just tried it and get this error:
[ERROR] [1407865037.519645268]: Exception thrown while starting IMU. This sometimes happens if you are not connected to an IMU or if another process is trying to access the IMU port. You may try 'lsof|grep /dev/microstrain' to see if other processes have the port open. timeout reached (in microstrain_3dmgx2_imu::IMU:read_with_timeout) You may find further details at http://www.ros.org/wiki/microstrain_3dmgx2_imu/Troubleshooting
Apparently this library supports it:  https://github.com/KumarRobotics/imu_3dm_gx4
I haven't tried it yet, will report back when I do.
