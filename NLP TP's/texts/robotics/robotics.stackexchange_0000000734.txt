Q:

Comparing maps to groundtruth

When you've created a map with a SLAM implementation and you have some groundtruth data, what is the best way to determine the accuracy of that map?  
My first thought is to use the Euclidean distance between the map and groundtruth. Is there some other measure that would be better?  I'm wondering if it's also possible to take into account the covariance of the map estimate in this comparison. 

A:

Assuming the map is a point cloud and that you know the alignment between the ground truth data and the map then calculating the mean squared error (MSE) would give you a relative understanding of the accuracy. A lower MSE would indicate they are very similar, 0 of course mean identical, and a high MSE would idicate they are very different.
If you do not know the alignment between the ground truth and the map then you could use expectation maximization over the alignments to find the best fit and then use MSE.
