Q:

How do I get full RobotState from MoveIt? (in python)

How do I get full RobotState from MoveIt? I could use /joint_states topic but there are more publishers of that, I would have to aggregate it somehow. There must be a simpler way, or am I wrong?

A:

You can use the get_planning_scene service to query information about the various parts of MoveIt's planning scene.
Here is the detailed description: http://docs.ros.org/api/moveit_msgs/html/srv/GetPlanningScene.html
PS: For some reason that service was first not available for me. I had to manually add this capability in the move_group.launch:
<param name="capabilities" value="move_group/MoveGroupCartesianPathService                                                            [...]
                                  move_group/MoveGroupGetPlanningSceneService" />
