Q:

What's the difference between OpenCV's BRIEF and rBRIEF in tod_*?

OpenCV implements the BRIEF descriptor as described in "BRIEF: Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features" (ECCV 2010). It's called cv::BriefDescriptorExtractor. ROS packages tod_training and tod_detecting have an own implementation called tod::RBriefDescriptorExtractor. I wonder where's the difference. Is there any publication I have missed?

I now think the "r" stands for "Rotation" (backed up by a glance at the source code), and BRIEF as it is originally described in the paper is not designed to produce rotation-invariant features. So, this indicates the modification to incorporate rotation-invariance. Needs to be confirmed, though.

A:

rBRIEF was a modified BRIEF. It has proven to be insufficient and was replaced by a new descriptor (ORB) that will be detailed in OpenCV 2.3 due on Monday June 20th, 2011

Thanks. Looking forward to the corresponding paper. ORB can also be used from OpenCV trunk (I know that rev 5465 works).
