Q:

INFO: 'my_robot' extern controller: Waiting for local or remote connection on port 1234 targeting robot named 'my_robot'

I using ROS-Foxy on Ubuntu-20.04 installed using WSL 2. I also have installed R2023b version of webots on windows (the host). I followed the ROS-Foxy instructions to setup webots-ros2. However, when I tried running the example at https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Webots/Setting-Up-Simulation-Webots-Basic.html I got the bellow errors:
WARNING: Parquetry "PBRAppearance" > ImageTexture : Texture image size of 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/R2022b/projects/appearances/protos/textures/parquetry/chequered_parquetry_base_color.jpg' is not a power of two: rescaling it from -1x-1 to 0x0.

I need help on how to resolve this.
Thank you in advance

A:

Open your Robot Node and check the field "name".
That name must match exactly the name of the robot in your launch file.
For instance. If the name in your robot node is "Zachariah", then your launch file will look like:
my_robot_driver = Node(
    package='webots_ros2_driver',
    executable='driver',
    output='screen',
    additional_env={'WEBOTS_CONTROLLER_URL': controller_url_prefix() + 'Zachariah'},
    parameters=[
        {'robot_description': robot_description},
    ]
