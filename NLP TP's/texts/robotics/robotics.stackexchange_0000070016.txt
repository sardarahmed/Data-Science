Q:

Finding sphinxbase

Hello,
I am very new to ROS so please excuse me if this is a completely silly question.
I am trying to compile a package given to me by someone.  I have an initialized  ros_ws folder with the package in the src subdirectory.  I type "catkin_make" and get the following error:
 -- checking for module 'sphinxbase'
 --   package 'sphinxbase' not found CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:283
(message):
   A required package was not found Call Stack (most recent call first):  
 /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:337 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)  
 sphinx_mcl/CMakeLists.txt:8 (pkg_check_modules)

Here's the first few lines of the CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(sphinx_mcl)
find_package(PkgConfig)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS   roscpp )
pkg_check_modules(SPHINX REQUIRED sphinxbase)
pkg_check_modules(POCKETSPHINX REQUIRED pocketsphinx)

It finds pocketsphinx o.k. and I've installed (practically) every Ubuntu package I can think of with the name sphinx in it.
Any ideas?

Thanks Assad.  Finally figured out  that  I was missing libsphinxbase-dev.  New to Ubuntu too!
