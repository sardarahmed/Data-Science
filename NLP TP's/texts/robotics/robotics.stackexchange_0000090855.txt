Q:

catkin_make --pkg

Hello,
Could please someone explains to me one thing. Currently, I am trying to install pkg for Astra camera from source git: https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera . Firstly, I downloaded the directory by using git clone https://github.com/orbbec/ros_astra_camera. Next, in the instruction, I have to build it by using catkin_make --pkg. However, as an argument, I am writing astra_camera and not ros_astra_camera (as the pkg name). While I tried to do catkin_make --pkg ros_astra_camera there was an error, that it couldn't find that pkg. So my question is how does that function work catkin_make --pkg and why it couldn't find the right name of the pkg, but only astra_camera (I do not have astra_camera pkg only ros_astra_camera).
While I am running: catkin_make --pkg ros_astra_camera -DFILTER=OFF, it shows me next error:
Packages "ros_astra_camera" not found in the workspace
Thanks

I have updated the question

now if I am running roscd astra_camera it follows me to ros_astra_camera.

A:

The repository/directory name is NOT the package name.
The package name is specified in two places:

in the package.xml
in the CMakeLists.txt

This is why catkin_make --pkg astra_camera is working, but not with ros_astra_camera.
The directory can actually have any name. But it makes sense to have it the same as the package, for obvious reasons...
