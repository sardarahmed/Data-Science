Q:

p2os setup failed... for Hydro

I've been working through the p2os-vanderbilt setup tutorial and have been having many issues.  I am currently using Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Hydro and a Pioneer 3-DX connected to my SlimPro via serial comm port.
I have successfully installed and compiled the p2os and the pr2 controllers packages:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-p2os-driver ros-hydro-p2os-teleop ros-hydro-p2os-launch ros-hydro-p2os-urdf
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-pr2-controllers ros-groovy-joystick-drivers
cd ~/catkin_ws/src && git clone https://github.com/allenh1/p2os.git  /*note different from tutorial*/
git clone https://github.com/allenh1/vanderbilt-ros-pkg.git          /*note different from tutorial*/
source ../devel/setup.bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

When I try:
rosrun p2os_driver p2os_driver

so I can then enable the motor, I get an error:
[ INFO] [1417478313.806461148]: using serial port: [/dev/ttyS0]
[ INFO] [1417478313.835717295]: P2OS connection opening serial port /dev/ttyS0...
[ERROR] [1417478313.835785839]: P2OS::Setup():open():
[ERROR] [1417478313.835822762]: p2os setup failed...

I went into ~/catkin_ws/src/p2os/p2os_driver/include/p2os_driver/robot_param.h and changed the DEFAULT_P2OS_PORT "/dev/ttyS0" to DEFAULT_P2OS_PORT "/dev/tty0" and changed the ros parameter with:
rosparam set /p2os/port /dev/tty0

and I got the same issue as before (except the error read "tty0" instead).  I've tried enabling the motor before and after running the p2os_driver.
Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
On a side note, does anyone know where I can find the p2os_dashboard for Hydro?  Thanks.

A:

I've been emailing back and forth with Hunter Allen of Vanderbilt.
I simply had to use this command:
sudo chmod 777 -R /dev/ttyS0

and it began working.
Additionally, if you are using a USB connection, use the following:
sudo chmod 777 -R /dev/ttyUSB0

I have tested it out successfully with the C++ Velocity Node from the p2os-vanderbilt tutorials (with a few minor adjustments).
Thanks for all your help y'all.
