Q:

ROS Diamondback and archlinux: some of yaourt's and pacman's output suppressed?

I encountered some difficulty with installing ROS dependencies on Archlinux (via --dep-install). The output of the interactive pacman and yaourt sessions does not appear in full length in the terminal (the questions are not printed to the terminal). I managed to blindly answer the questions  by yaourt and pacman and thus install ROS diamondback on arch. I tested this on two different Arch installations.
Did anyone else notice this phenomenon, or even knows of a workaround?
Here is a screenshot of the output, notice the questions for the root password, and the questions whether to proceed with the installation - they are both not printed (pasting terminal output to another window shows that it's not just an issue of terminal colors):

A:

This is a bug in the implementation. In the debian/apt implementation the flags are passed to make it non interactive.
