Q:

Model Plugin with QT objects, is it possible?

Can QT objects (e.g. A QMainWindow) be declared within a ModelPlugin, and if so can an example be provided? I want to create a plugin to control a model joints so when the model is inserted in gazebo a new window with personalized controls is displayed.
In the header file along from the class that inherits from ModelPlugin i tried declaring another class that inherits from QMainWindow, it compiles just fine but when the plugin is included in a sdf model and i insert it to gazebo it fails to load the plugin with an undefined symbol error for the class inheriting from QMainWindow.

Hi,
I am not sure if you can do it from a Model Plugin, if you manage let me know ;)
However, you can access the QT parts via the GUI overlay.
Cheers,
Andrei

You can't use QT object from a model plugin. As Andrei mentioned, a  GUI overlay is the correct way to go.

Alright, thanks for the answers.
The only way to interact with a model in this case is by using the transport layer, correct?
