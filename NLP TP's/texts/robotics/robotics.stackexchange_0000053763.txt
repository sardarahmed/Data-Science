Q:

Workspace exploration from urdf?

Hi.
Is there an easy way or a package to compute forward kinematics from an URDF file? The idea behind is to "explore" the workspace of a robot, plotting reachable points and dexterous area.
As far as I understand the document, TF is for tracking frames. KDL could do the tricks, but did not see if it is possible to use the URDF description of the robot to feed it.
Thanks in advance.

A:

The robot that I used is finally a RRR arm. So I wrote a code in Python that explores all possible solutions of the forward kinematic. That gives a big table (not that big either) and requests on this table are quite fast.
Here is the code on GitHub:

And a plot of the result:

Hey, has the github repo been moved?

Yes, I have removed everything some time at the beginning of the year
