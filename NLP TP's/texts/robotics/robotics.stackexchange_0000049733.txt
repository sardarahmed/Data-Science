Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rosrun UWSim

Hy,
i'm trying to run UWSim but when I type rosrun UWSim UWSim it shows me this:
Warning: Failed to connect to host. Make sure 3D acceleration is enabled for this VM.
[ INFO] [1364229036.589787181]: pluginlib WARNING: PLUGINLIB_DECLARE_CLASS is deprecated, please use PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS instead. You can run the script 'plugin_macro_update' provided with pluginlib in your package source folder to automatically and recursively update legacy macros.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
i'm following installing instructions and don't understand where is the problem

A:

It sounds like you're running from within a virtual machine.  UWSim requires OpenGL and a fairly recent graphics card.  You'll need to make sure your Virtual Machine is set up to provide hardware-accelerated access to the graphics card.  Not all VM environments support this.  See the discussion here for more details.  If you're using VirtualBox, see these instructions for how to configure Hardware Accelerated Graphics.
Similar errors are often produced when trying to run rviz from a remote X-server or in a Virtual Machine, if the 3D graphics aren't set up correctly.
You can try using glxinfo or glxgears to test and see if your 3D environment is working correctly.
