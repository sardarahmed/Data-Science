Q:

Developing on Windows using Eclipse?

I wish I could develop ROS on an IDE like Eclipse on Windows. However I did not found any reference to install on windows.
Does that work??? because it would be much more practical than having to use a Virtual Machine.

What version of Windows?
Comment by renanmb on 2017-08-16:
windows 10 on my desktop and windows 7 on my notebook

A:

Here are some instructions on how to get ROS working on Windows 10. It won't work on Windows 7 because Windows 7 doesn't have the ability to run linux binaries natively which Windows 10 can (mostly from what I know). This will require you to do a manual patch to ros_comm.

You can use Eclipse on Ubuntu from what I know if that's all that you're looking for.

Edit:
As @gvdhoorn pointed out in the comments, there are issues with using ROS on Windows. Here's the admonition that was referred to:

Note that this is not a native
installation of ROS Lunar on Windows,
but the Ubuntu version of ROS Lunar
running on-top of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
Support for GUI tools is limited (fi:
all 3D rendering is software based)
and needs additional software on the
Windows side (X server), access to
hardware is currently not or only
minimally possible (a WSL limitation)
and Windows file system performance is
not on-par with a Linux system which
has an impact on IO-bottlenecked
tasks.

Does it work for ROS Kinetic?
Comment by jayess on 2017-08-16:
According to this comment from the instructions, it was only tested on Lunar. The person that this comment was replying to was trying with Kinetic but wasn't having much luck.

My goal is to write the code in windows, copy all the files like the directory with src, makefile, package.xml, launch, then paste on my device running Ubuntu and install like I do with everything else, just like github.
Have you tested before doing the same?
Comment by jayess on 2017-08-16:
No. I actually prefer using Ubuntu. Windows (for me) tends to makes development less straightforward than Ubuntu.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-08-17:
@renanmb: please take note of the admonition on the wiki/Installation/Windows page that @jayess linked.
ROS on Win10 on WSL is far from a native installation of ROS on Windows, so expect some bumpiness.

It is true. Windows does not work very well. Virtual Machine works fine for most of the time.
