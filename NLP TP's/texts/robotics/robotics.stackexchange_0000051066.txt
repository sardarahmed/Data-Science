Q:

catkin_make install issue: File INSTALL cannot find

When running $ catkin_make install, I get the following error:
CMake Error at HeartBeat/heart/cmake_install.cmake:40 (FILE):
  file INSTALL cannot find "/home/brandon/ros_ws/devel/include/heart_listener".
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake_install.cmake:83 (INCLUDE)

If I create the directory that it can't find, the install works. However, I would like a permanent fix for this issue. Why is this happening?
My CMakeLists.txt looks like this:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(heart_listener)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs genmsg)
generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES std_msgs)
catkin_package(CATKIN_DEPENDS std_msgs roscpp)
include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(heart_listener_node src/heart_listener.cpp)
add_dependencies(heart_listener_node std_msgs_gencpp)
target_link_libraries(heart_listener_node ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

My ROS workspace looks like this:
~/ros_ws/
-build    
-devel
-install
-src
--HeartBeat
---heart_listener
----msg
----src
----Package.xml
----CMakeLists.txt

A:

The problem was that I wasn't using any custom messages for my project. I needed to remove generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES std_msgs) from CMakeLists.txt.
