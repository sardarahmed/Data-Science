Q:

Launch node based on parameters from parameter server

Hello, is it possible to achieve conditional launching of nodes based on parameters (not arguments!) on roslaunch XML files?
A workaround I think of might be a dummy Python node that would eventually launch the given node after evaluating parameters, but being able to do so in the launch file directly would be great.

A:

This will probably never be supported in ROS 1. There was a series of pull requests that added the support, but it was not merged: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/pull/2097 .
