Q:

process has died , exit code -11

I installed this framework and followed the instructions, but when I run it, I get the following error:

this is the file that fails while running. it doesn't go further than line 218.
and it has the correct path to vocabulary and yaml file
any help is appreciated
p.s.: there isn't any log file whatsoever, I don't know why it mentions the log file at the end
heres a part of the code where it reports it cant find the files then it goes forward:
I think there's a possibility that this is not actually the issue
auto exist = [](std::string filename) {
    std::ifstream fs(filename);
    if (!fs.good()) std::cerr << "File does not exist: " << filename << std::endl;
    return fs.good();
};

auto directory = [](std::string path) {
    size_t pos = path.find_last_of("\\/");
    return (std::string::npos == pos) ? "" : path.substr(0, pos);
};

// find the specified filenames in the same folder of the default vocabulary/config
if (!exist(p_vocabulary_)) {
    p_vocabulary_ = directory(default_vocabulary) + "/" + p_vocabulary_;
    if (!exist(p_vocabulary_)) return false;
}
if (!exist(p_config_)) {
    p_config_ = directory(default_config) + '/' + p_config_;
    if (!exist(p_config_)) return false;
}

std::cout << "Vocabulary: " << p_vocabulary_ << "\n";
std::cout << "Config: " << p_config_ << "\n";

P.S: I've found that this line is the one causing the problem:
could it be an opencv issue?
cv::FileStorage config_fs(p_config_.c_str(), cv::FileStorage::READ);

A:

turns out the problem was my opencv 4.2 interfering with opencv 3.2 which is installed by default through ros melodic.
After taking Alex's seggestion and installing GDB.
I ran the launch file with GDB and it was in fact a segmentation fault. While tracing back the issue I saw couple of lines pointing to opencv3.2.so and others pointing to opencv4.2.so. after uninstalling the opencv and rebuilding the framework and ros package the issue got resolved. Thanks again to @Alex
