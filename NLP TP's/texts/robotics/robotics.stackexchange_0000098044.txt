Q:

ROS Noetic Install Wiki Page Enhancement

Hi,
I noticed that the ROS Noetic install wiki page at http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu does not include the section titled 'Dependencies for building packages' as previous ROS distros did. As a result, new ROS developers might not realize that they need to install tools like python3-rosdep, build-essential, along with other handy python packages. Then when they try to run rosdep, they don't understand why packages are failing to be installed correctly. I think it's even more imperative to include this section especially because many of these packages have slightly different names (that include a '3' for Python3).

You are able to edit this yourself if you like! If you make a ROS wiki account you can edit pages to reflect that change :-)

Thanks @stevemacenski,
I didn't realize that anyone could edit the ROS Wiki pages. I'll give this a shot.

A:

As @stevemacenski mentioned, I was able to make the necessary edits by creating a Wiki account and editing the page directly.
