Q:

Pr2MotorsAnalyzers

Hi all,
I have read analyzer http://www.ros.org/wiki/diagnostics/Tutorials/Creating%20a%20Diagnostic%20Analyzer  and checked it. It works. I use SICK LMS200 with Pioneer-3DX, how can i collect diagnostic data for the pioneer motor and this laser sensor?
regards,

A:

The diagnostics are published by the drivers.  I do not believe either the Sick driver or the Pioneer driver publish diagnostics in this form at the moment.
This mechanism is covered in REP 107. Adding diagnostics would be a feature enhancement for both these drivers.

The sicktoolbox_wrapper (SICK driver) definitely does not publish diagnostics right now.
