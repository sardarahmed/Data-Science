Q:

Roomba schedule opcode: 167, byte 1

Just a short question: The iRobot Create 2 Open Interface spec says:
Serial sequence: [167] [Days] [Sun Hour] [Sun Minute] [Mon Hour] etc.
Can somebody explain to me, what "Days" stands for?

A:

of course, it is a roomba create 2. sorry for this.. 
The last comment helped: the requested variable stands for: the sum of days of a week, the roomba is meant to work.
Value Day: 1 Sunday, 2 Monday, 4 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 32 Friday, 64 Saturday
Examples: 127 = every day, 40 = Wednesday and Friday
Thank you! :)
