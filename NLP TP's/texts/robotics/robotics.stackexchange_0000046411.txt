Q:

rosbag play on two machines

Hi,
I have recorded simultaneously multiple cameras sequences on two machines with rosbag.
I now would like to replay this sequence simulataneously on the two machines (to avoid transfer images on the network) with a good synchronization.
Is it possible to do it with rosbag or should I need to code this myself ?

A:

I don't think that is possible with rosbag. You will have to implement it yourself.
