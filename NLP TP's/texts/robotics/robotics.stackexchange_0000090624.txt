Q:

LSD-SLAM virtual camera calibration

Hello,
I have recorded some actions using  $rosbag record within the virtual simulator called UWSim. I am trying right now to make it work with lsd_slam.
My camera topic is /g500/camera1
Therefore, I ran lsd_slam as follow:
 rosrun lsd_slam_core live_slam image:=/g500/camera1 camera_info:=/camera_info 

Now of course I am getting a message saying "WAITING for ROS camera calibration!". I have found someone previously asking how to calibrate virtual camera, however the answer was there is no need. Then what kind of calibration data I should send?

A:

Managed to solve it.
I calculated the camera parameters and this is what Ive got (I calculated these by following this answer):
0.804 1.07 0 0 0
320 240
none
320 240

I saved these configs into a my_calib.cfg file in /lsd_slam/lsd_slam_core/calib.
Then I ran the following line:
 rosrun lsd_slam_core live_slam image:=/g500/camera1 _calib='path//lsd_slam/lsd_slam_core/calib/my_calib.cfg'

and after that I ran
rosbag play *my_file*

LSD_SLAM reacted and showed some signs of being ALIVE!
