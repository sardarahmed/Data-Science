Q:

How to redirect a web repository to a local folder in a ROS package?

Hi!!!
I'm newbie in this. I'm trying to use the turtlebot packages in a Roomba 600 but I can't. I've found that the default rate is 57600 and I need to change it to 115200. I've saw in the folder "create_driver" that it is at /opt/ros/indigo/share/create_driver the "package.xml" file and this file uses the roomba driver of a github repository, this is the code:
<package>
  <name>create_driver</name>
  <version>2.3.0</version>
  <description>
    Driver for iRobot Create and Roomba
    
    This is a generic driver for iRobot Create that currently holds
    implementations for Turtlebot and Roomba. Port
    of pyrobot.py by Damon Kohler.  It is currently labeled as
    turtlebot_driver pending review by the entire create community
    before using the name create_driver.
  
    For ROS bindings, please see turtlebot_node.

  <export>

In that repository uses a baud rate of 57600 and my robot works with 115200, I've download the package of this repository and I've change it the baud rate but I don't know how to use it instead of the web repository, that I imagine is this line code :   <url type="repository">https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_create</url>
Thanks in advance!!!

I have some questions. Have you created workspace and initiated it? Do you know how to clone the package getting it from online? Maybe, I could help you getting the answer of these questions.

Thanks to show my question Dr, with respect to his questions, I have a workspace and I know how to clone a package, but I cloned the "turtlebot_create" package in this directory /opt/ros/indigo/share/ because I imagine that this package is a complement of the "turtlebot_bringup" package.

I've followed this tutorial [http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/indigo/TurtleBot%20Bringup] to execute this package with the respective configurations of the roomba base, but I have not connection, I think that it is by the baud rate.
Comment by Diana_Elyza on 2016-11-06:
By that reason I found that the roomba driver is execute it online or I think so, and this driver is configured in 57600 bauds. For this reason I wonder how to execute this driver of locally way so I can make the change of the baud rate.
Thanks by your attention.

A:

You need to create a workspace to put your code inside and be able to use it there.
This topic is covered in the beginner tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials I'd recommend working through all of those as it will cover this topic as well as a bunch of other ones which will help you be able to debug your system.

Thank you very much by your answer. Do I need to put all the turtlebot package in my workspace??? Because I followed this tutorial link text and I did the settings for a roomba base.
Comment by Diana_Elyza on 2016-11-06:
I've found that there are many complements of the turtlebot package, like the "turtlebot_create" package that contains the roomba driver. By that reason I do not how to redirect the driver of these package to the "turtlebot_bringup".
Thanks by your attention.
