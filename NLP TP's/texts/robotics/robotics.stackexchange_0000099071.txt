Q:

can't install smach_viewer on ros melodic

I tried installing smach with the command
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-smach ros-melodic-smach-ros ros-melodic-
executive-smach ros-melodic-smach-viewer

from the book i'm reading ROS Robotics Projects by Ramkumar Gandhinathan, Lentin Joseph. while the other packages got installed the smach_viewer package gave a 404 error. After checking the package on this link i found out that some of the deb files were missing. please how do i solve this problem.
this is the error i'm getting:

A:

Did you run sudo apt-get update before trying to install them?
It looks like your local apt index is out-of-date.

Let's not conflate issues.
ROS Answers works best with a 1-to-1 ratio of questions-to-answers. Follow-up questions in comments have very little visibility, so it's better to post a new question.
