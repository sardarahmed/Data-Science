Q:

How can I zoom in rxgraph?

I ran the rxgraph but the nodes and topics are too small to read them directly. How can I zoom into the graph so I can read it easily??

A:

You can zoom using the scroll wheel on your mouse, or by double clicking on the node(s) you're interested in.

Thx. Scroll wheel works good, double clicking doesn't work both on my machines for some reason. Ubuntu 10.10
