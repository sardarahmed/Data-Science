Q:

autoware.auto lgsvl Message type sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 does not have a field header.seq

I am trying to reproduce the AVP demo on branch master: https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/avpdemo.html
As indicated in the documentation, I have:

started lgsvl launched
autoware_auto_visualization.launch.py
launched ms3_sim.launch.py

From there, I start the lgsvl simulation and the autoware_auto_visualization.launch.py terminal is spammed by errors like:

[rosbridge_websocket-3] [ERROR] [1617948492.535521192] [gui.rosbridge_server_node]: [Client 0] publish: Message type sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 does not have a field header.seq

When the problem occurs, the simulation seems to run fine, and LGSVL says it is properly connected to rosbrige
On Rviz side I cannot get to visualize any message from the simulation
Example logs: https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2102935

A:

You might be using the ROS bridge instead of the ROS2NativeBridge in your vehicle config as seq is a field that doesn't exist in ROS2 header messages anymore.

Indeed, I overlooked the documentation.
