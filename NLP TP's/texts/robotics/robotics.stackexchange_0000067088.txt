Q:

how to set-up /tf_static?

I’m setting up the move_base on our robot to allow autonomous navigation.
In order to publish the static transform between base_laser and base_link and reduce the load on the “communication” link, I want to use the tf_static topic of tf2 instead of the tf:broadcaster. I don’t understand how to do that. Could you help me?
Is it possible for move_base to use transform publish on tf_static topic?
Best regards,

A:

I usually use this command in a launchfile :
<launch>
      <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" 
            name="my_tf" args="0 0 1 3.14 0 1.57 /map /my_tf 30"/>
</launch>

the args are the translation for the 3 first arguments and the angles ( in Radian in an Euler form ) for the 3 last ones.
I hope this will help you
