Q:

Using rqt_plot, how to find the topic name?

in the rqt_plot part of understandingTopic toturial http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics
the topic is

/turtle1/pose/x

/turtle1/pose/y

/turtle1/pose/theta

but I can only find the topic

/turtle1/pose/

using command

rostopic list

(and rqt_plot doesn't work when only fill /turtle1/pose/ in the textbox)
where can I find the x/y/theta?

A:

you must use it in this form

rqt_plot /topic1/field1

To graph multiple fields of a message:

rqt_plot /topic1/field1:field2:field3

To graph the data all on the same plot:

$ rqt_plot
/topic1/field1,/topic2/field2

Comment by Hamid Didari on 2014-02-08:
use "$rosmsg show msg_name" or use "$rostopic echo topic_name " to see diffrent fields of msg
