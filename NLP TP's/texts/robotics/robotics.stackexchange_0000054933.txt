Q:

I can install and build rosjava but can't run tutorials

Can someone post step by step instructions to get the rosjava pub_sub tutorial working. Working on Ubuntu, and I need it to work with Groovy.
So is there anyone who can give a tutorial with step by step instructions s.t. one can get code running.

A:

It seems rosjava is changing a lot, you can probably use the code from
https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_extras to get going, until tutorials are updated.
Also look at my updated tutorial code:

Thanks. But it's still not working (the tutorial code doesn't work either).

Both links I gave should now give you projects that compile and run. If they don't for you, post the error you get. Consider asking at rosjava SIG: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ros-sig-java I started an issue for the tutorials: https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core/issues/178

Failure Could not determine which tasks to execute. Task installApp not found in root project rosjava.
There are the error messages.

Can you open a github issue on that, and paste the log, it will be easier to resolve than here.

I do have a question: why are you not using gradlew?
Comment by KruseT on 2013-10-21:
gradlew is also okay to use, and easy to add. I did not think it was important, but could add it. "gradle installApp" would be run in the tutorials project, not in any other gradle/rosjava project. run "gradle tasks" to see what tasks are configured. (Or gradlew tasks).
