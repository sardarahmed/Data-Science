Q:

Problem with Beginner Tutorials #17

Hi, when I try to use the command rosbag record -a, it gives me this output:
robot@ASHROCK:~/bagfiles$ rosbag record -a /opt/ros/hydro/lib/rosbag/record: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/librosbag.so: undefined symbol:
_ZN3ros7console5printEPNS0_10FilterBaseEPN7log4cxx6LoggerENS0_6levels5LevelEPKciS9_S9_z

What is this error and what can I do to fix it?
Thanks!

Did you install ros desktop full?

A:

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade 

was the solution.
