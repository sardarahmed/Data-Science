Q:

Pure Arduino Quadcopter

I recently bought a set of escs, brushless outrunner motors and propellers. I'm trying to perform a calibration on the esc, but I can't find how I can do that without using components other than the arduino uno itself. The setup I've managed to make is the one shown in the picture. The escs are a mystery, as there is no manual to be found. If it helps, the buy link is this : http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/4x-A2212-1000KV-Outrunner-Motor-4x-HP-30A-ESC-4x-1045-prop-B-Quad-Rotor-/111282436897
There might also be a problem with the battery (LiPo 3.7V, 2500mAh).

Can andybody figure out what I'm doing wrong?
The sample arduino code I found was this:
#include <Servo.h>

#define MAX_SIGNAL 2000
#define MIN_SIGNAL 700
#define MOTOR_PIN 9

Servo motor;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Program begin...");
  Serial.println("This program will calibrate the ESC.");

  motor.attach(MOTOR_PIN);

  Serial.println("Now writing maximum output.");
  Serial.println("Turn on power source, then wait 2 seconds and press any key.");
  motor.writeMicroseconds(MAX_SIGNAL);

  // Wait for input
  while (!Serial.available());
  Serial.read();

  // Send min output
  Serial.println("Sending minimum output");
  motor.writeMicroseconds(MIN_SIGNAL);

}

void loop() {  
}

A:

What is the problem you're having? You ask, "Can anybody figure out what I'm doing wrong?" but you don't state clearly what your problem is. Will the motors not spin up after? Is anything happening when you do the calibration?
As an FYI, here is an answer on EE stack exchange explaining the basic startup modes for an electronic speed controller. Quoting:

Normal starup [one style of ESC]:

Turn On ESC

minimum throttle

wait 2 seconds

maximum throttle

wait 2 seconds

minimum throttle

wait 1 second

OK to Go
Normal starup [another style of ESC]:

Turn On ESC

minimum

wait 3 seconds

OK to Go

Calibration:

Turn on ESC

maximum

wait 2 sec

minimum

wait 1 sec

OK to go

From that post, typically there's a beep from the ESC between each of these steps (where you're instructed to wait, wait for the beep).
