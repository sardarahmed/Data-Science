Q:

gui demo error about op3 Gazebo

I'm doing about gazebo of op3
But i enter " roslaunch op3_gui_demo op3_demo.launch " , then, there is an error " RLException: [op3_demo.launch] is neither a launch file in package [op3_gui_demo] nor is [op3_gui_demo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file "
I' d like to know about reason of error.
What can I do for escape from the error?
In advance, roscore and roslaunch op3_manager op3_gazebo.launch were executed.
And i'm using ros noetic (20.04).
Thanks.

A:

Unfortunately, the Robotis OP3 simulation is not available for ROS Noetic, last available was for ROS Kinetic: https://index.ros.org/r/robotis_op3/github-ROBOTIS-GIT-ROBOTIS-OP3/#kinetic
To make it work, in ROS Noetic, you will need to build it from source: https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/ROBOTIS-OP3 but expect some issues to resolve.
