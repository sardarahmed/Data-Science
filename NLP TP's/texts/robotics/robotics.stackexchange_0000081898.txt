Q:

How to combine string args in launch file?

This is my starting .launch file
  <launch>
<!-- usb webcam video0 -->
  <node name="usb_cam0" pkg="usb_cam" type="usb_cam_node" output="screen" >
    <param name="video_device" value="/dev/video0" />
  </node>
 </launch>

Now I would like to pass that zero as an argument by a command like
roslaunch mypackage mylauncher.launch N:=0

so I thought
  <launch>
<arg name="N"/>
<!-- usb webcam video number N as indicated in the argument -->
  <node name="usb_cam0" pkg="usb_cam" type="usb_cam_node" output="screen" >
   <param name="video_device" value="/dev/video$(arg N)" />
  </node>
 </launch>

Of course it does not work. I'm not an axpert at all of xml-like files... maybe the error is the combination of the string?
Or there is a way to do this better?
My final purpose is to allow the access to any video source with inputs in the launchfile
dev/video0
dev/video1
dev/video2

etc.
Thank you in advance

A:

Of course it does not work

can you tell us what you see, if it does not work?
This:
<launch>
  <arg name="n" />
  <param name="something" value="/dev/video$(arg n)"/>
</launch>

started as roslaunch my_pkg test.launch n:=4 result in:
something: /dev/video4

on my system.
See wiki/roslaunch/XML/arg and wiki/roslaunch/XML/param.
