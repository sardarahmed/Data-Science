Q:

Unable to comunicate ROS - Matlab

Dear ROS community!
I have a problem...I configured my matlab environment as ROS master and i want to connect external Linux machine.
I adjusted ROS_MASTER_URI inside the linux machine, after that i started matlab environment using rosinit. Matlab sees linux's topics and nodes, however linux doesn't see matlab master... The message is "ERROR:Unable to communicate with master" tapping rosnode list in Linux machine. Could you give me a direction to solve the problem?

A:

In addition to ROS_MASTER_URI, you must also set ROS_IP ( or ROS_HOSTNAME ).
