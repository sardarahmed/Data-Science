Q:

How to make robot movement in rviz with moveit smoother?

Hi
Is there a possibility to make the robot movement in rviz smoother?
As you can see in the video, the planned path is relatively smooth, but the simulated movement of the robot is lagging:

I created the moveit config of the robot by myself with the moveit setup assistant.
I am using kinetic with rviz version 1.12.16.
Thanks in advance

A:

The solution is to increse the parameter 'rate' for the joint_state_publisher.
The default is only 10 Hz.

Which you do by adding <param name="rate" value="100"/> to the joint_state_publisher call in your demo.launch file.

I thought this would fix it, but actually it isn't very smooth, still. There may be another parameter to tweak.

The overall resolution of MoveIt's fake controller&joint_state_controller is not overwhelming from my experience. I would recommend using https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/moveit_sim_controller , the underlying https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/ros_control_boilerplate/blob/melodic-devel/CMakeLists.txt#L86 or any other ros_control stub.

doesn't work
"rostopic hz /joint_states" increased but angles update rate is 10hz
