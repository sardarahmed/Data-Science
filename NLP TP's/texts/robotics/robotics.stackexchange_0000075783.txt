Q:

How to generate .deb of ROS package step by step outside ros buildfarm

Hi there,
Can anyone provide a tutorial to generate a .deb of a ROS package step by step so that the others can use it to install the package without source code.
Many thanks,
Rickardo

Hey Rikardo, did you solve this?

A:

If you want to build a ROS package into a deb, you can do it just like any debian package manually I highly recommend reading through the Debian documentation. There's a relatively steep learning curve unfortunately.
A few starting points are:

https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian
https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/build.en.html
https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/debian-packaging.html

I don't know what your use case is, but if you're building ROS packages privately you can still use bloom to generate a lot of the boilerplate needed above. And you can use git-buildpackage to build the resultant debian packages locally in approximately one line.
A simpler approach that can fill many use cases is to use the checkinstall tool. You can use checkinstall with the install target for a catkin workspace.
