Q:

Is it possible to use packages dedicated to other ROS distribution?

Hi,
actually I am working with tum_simulator and ardrone_autonomy. I find some interesting materials and tutorials like:
http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/wiki/index.php/Tag_recognition_using_webcam
http://robohub.org/up-and-flying-with-the-ar-drone-and-ros-handling-feedback/
but packages which are used in this links are a little bit old and are dedicated from older distributions.
Is it possible to use packages dedicated to other ROS distribution? or is there any simple tutorial how to transfer package to catkin standard and use it with Indigo?

A:

I believe ardrone_autonomy has already been converted to a catkin package, and has been released for ROS Indigo. Just enter sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ardrone-autonomy into a terminal. Failing that, grab the indigo-devel branch from the Git repository.
As for tum_simulator, it looks like @Gary Servin submitted a pull request to get that updated to catkin and Indigo as well.
EDIT: for future reference, see this tutorial on migrating from rosbuild to catkin.

Thank you for your response. Actually I am using ardrone_autonomy and tum_simulator ported to Indigo. I was wandering if this
tutorials can be used with ardrone but I guess that without changing to catkin - not.
