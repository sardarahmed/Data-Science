Q:

Some recommendations to develop my own mechanism_model package

Hi Ros Community,
I want to develop my own mechanism_model package to simulate and control in Gazebo. The actuators as you know are primates, but the rotational joints. Then I want you to give me some recommendations on. Besides, Also I want to know if I have to develop my own controller package.
Best Regards,
Carlos Mastalli

a good place to start is by looking at the http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_mechanism and http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_cntrollers stacks.  Let us know if you have more specific questions about design, implementation, etc. of these functionality.
