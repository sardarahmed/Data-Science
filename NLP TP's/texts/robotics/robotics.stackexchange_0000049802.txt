Q:

Header file for obtaining data from Kinect for Point Cloud data

I am unable to find openni_grabber.h file in pcl/io folder. Do I need openni_grabber.h or grabber.h is enough for obtaining data from Kinect ? And also can anyone help me on functioning of pcd_io.h. Please post any proper documentation site or any site where it has been used.

A:

To answer the second question: The PCL homepage is a good starting point for everything PCL-related, including tutorials and the documentation of the io-module.
To integrate a kinect in ROS: have you tried setting it up using the openni_camera stack? The published topics can then easily be subscribed to and accessed using PCL (see PCL ROS overview).
