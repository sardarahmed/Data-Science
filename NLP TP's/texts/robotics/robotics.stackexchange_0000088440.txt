Q:

Sudden velocity changes and their impact on a Turtlebot

I am using a Turtlebot3. Their provided "teleop" code example the code makes sure that the velocity requested via cmd_vel messages don't change too quickly too radically.  However many of the other examples seem to just send cmd_vel's without worrying too much about ramping. Some say that the motors (dynamixels) or the motor controller board (opencr) will make sure that the ramping happens and that cmd_vels above the maximum speeds are ignore. I am having a hard time getting clear on this.
So my question is:  If I send a series of cmd_vel with for example x = 0.15 and immediately follow it with a cmd_vel with x = 0, with that harm the robot in any way?

A:

I don't know about TB3, but on TB2 (kobuki base), the yocs_velocity_smoother nodelet takes care of properly filtering incoming Twists.
