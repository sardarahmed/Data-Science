Q:

How to set use_sim_time

Hi, I am wondering how you can set use_sim_time to true, or enable it for my nodes. Do I have to do it within my nodes? or in my launch file? Also, is this something you must do for all your nodes and/or launch files? Thanks.

A:

If you need to set use_sim_time from the commandline, then rosparam is your friend. Please read https://wiki.ros.org/rosparam
If you need to set it from a launch file, you can use either the <rosparam> tag to read a yaml file of parameters (https://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/rosparam) or you can use the <param> tag to set a particular parameter, like use_sim_time (https://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/param). For example, add <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true" />
Reading the documentation helps alot.
Also helpful is the documentation regarding the ros clock: https://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/rosparam
You only need to set the /use_sim_time (note that it is in the root namespace) parameter once, and all your nodes will start using simulation time.

Thanks for the informative response!

The example: <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"> is missing the closing /. If you copy paste this, use: <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/>

Applied @FantasticMrFox's suggestion to add closing slash.
