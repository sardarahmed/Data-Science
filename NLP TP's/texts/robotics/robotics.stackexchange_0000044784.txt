Q:

rviz problem with server x

Hi guys,
When I want to run empty rviz (rosrun rviz rviz) I get the following error
rviz: cannot connect to X server.
Do somebody know what to do?
Thanks!

A:

I guess you do not have an X server running. Are you maybe trying to run it inside an ssh connection or not inside a terminal in a graphical environment such as Ubuntu's Unity?
If you want to run rviz locally but visualize data from a robot, just set the variable ROS_MASTER_URI on your pc correctly. Have a look here for more information.
