Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS on Yocto

I want to use a light Linux distribution for a robotic wheelchair application, and was thinking of using Yocto. How can I get ROS Kinetic installed on it?

A:

Some quick googling for "ROS Yocto" turns up https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layer/meta-ros/ , https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros and https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/TipsAndTricks/Creating_Recipes_for_ROS_modules

This is the answer. bmwcarit/meta-ros is very active and has a good size community.
I don't understand how the OP could not have found this while searching for "ROS Yocto".

Most of the references in that project either don't list a ROS version, or refer to "Hydro". It wasn't clear to me at a glance that they also support other ROS version (I suspect they're on a rolling release, but I don't know enough about yocto packages to confirm).

Thanks for the links. Are there differences between ROS on Ubuntu or Yocto?

Can you share instructions how to setup this meta-ros because instructions are not clear. I mean how to properly add this to bblayer.config and check if it's properly configured. Thanks in advance
