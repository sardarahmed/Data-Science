Q:

Can a 5S LIPO battery be changed to a 3S and a 2S?

Newbie to robotics here! 
I bought a 5S LIPO but now realise that it is overkill. And these things are expensive!
So, given that (as far as I know) the pack is apparently made up of individual cells of 3.7 volts each, is there any way in which I could somehow (safely) separate out the cells to get a 3S and a 2S or even single 1S cells?

A:

If you open a Lipopack it looks basically like this:

There you can see the single cells with some cables attached to them.
If you want to open a lipo pack you have to cut the packaging with knife....
This is more or less everything you have to do. You will have 5cells which wired in series. just cut the cables to divide them in 3-2 and then you have to solder two cables.
There is one Thing you have to careful with: Try to not damage the cells with the knife, because lithium is an alkali metal and these metals react violently with the oxygen in the air. At the end the cell will ignite itself (it won't explode, don't worry) and the fumes may be dangerous.
