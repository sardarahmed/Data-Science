Q:

HG Mercurial Check Out Question

Hey guys,
I'm new to this ROS business and I needed help with TF and URDF.  Usually I "svn co" something, but these two packages require me to "hg" the link.  I have
"sudo apt-get install mercurial"
the mercurial SCM, but when i try to hg these packages it says
"abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!"
I don't know where to go from here.  Thanks in advance for the help!
-Matthew

A:

Mercurial is pretty straightforward, as an example:
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_ros

You can always grab the latest version with:
hg pull
hg update

And you can see other branches with the "branches" command:
hg branches

For anything more than that, I would suggest the Mercurial Quickstart

Joel Spolsky's tutorial (http://hginit.com/) is excellent, as well.
