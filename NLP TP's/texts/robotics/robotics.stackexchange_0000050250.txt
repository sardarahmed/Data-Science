Q:

rviz global options target frame is missing in groovy

I want to use the urg Hokuyo laserscanner node, which needs the /laser frame. In http://answers.ros.org/question/10655/fixed-frame-laser-does-not-exist/ it is suggested to use the /laser target frame in order to make it work. The target frame option in Groovy's rviz is missing, perhaps it uses an other solution I don't know.

A:

You will find this under Fixed Frame under Global Options in the Displays Panel.

Yes I am aware of that, but I am looking for the "target frame". It was present in the Fuerte version and in Grovvy it is missing.

This is in the "Views" panel.
