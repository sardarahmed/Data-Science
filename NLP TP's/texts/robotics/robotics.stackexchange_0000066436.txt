Q:

Send an Ogre3D object from an RViz panel

Hi everyone,
I'm currently working on an RViz panel, from which I would like to send Ogre3D objects (any kind of objects) in the RViz render window, just as ImuDisplay tutorial already does.
I think that my problem is I can't get the scene_manager_ variable from within my panel, since it doesn't inherit from (rviz::Panel) – contrary to rviz::Display or rviz::Tool.
I know that there is a protected attribute named vis_manager_ in all panel objects – inherited from rviz::VisualizationManager class – which has a getSceneManager() method, but it doesn't seem to work… (meaning that when I want to add my panel, RViz crashes, without any error code, but just says Segmentation fault (core dumped))
Here's my repo link: Github repo, on Ogre3D branch.
Does anyone have a hint? Does a panel that can send Ogre3D objects already exist? I remain at your disposal for any further information. Thanks a lot!

The link to GitHub doesn't seem to work. Just because there is a Segmentation Fault doesn't mean it's rviz related, you'll need to debug it with gdb to know what the issue is: http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/segfaults.html

A:

A guess: in your constructor, you're attempting to do a Qt connect with _visual, which isn't created until the onInitialize method is called.
