Q:

How can I test a ros package version from python script

It appears there's a mechanism to fetch package version via ROS, available in CLI

e.g. rosversion nano_light

0.0.0

where 0.0.0 is saved in the ROS package XML
is there an API to get this data from rospy?

A:

Here's one way to do it in Python, using rospkg:
import rospkg

r = rospkg.RosPack()
m = r.get_manifest('my_package')
print(m.version)

# Output: '1.3.0'
