Q:

rostopic:command not found error-- turtlebot fuerte workstation pc

I recently upgraded from ros electric to fuerte on the turtlebot 1. Installed everything smoothly on the turtlebot pc and the workstation pc. However when running the network test on both pc's, I get the error on the workstation pc when running the
rostopic list 
rostopic: command not found

what should be the problem? I installed the full desktop version of fuerte on both pcs.
I am using Ubuntu 12.04 on both pcs.

A:

Did u follow the complete tutorial?? You have to make some changes in .bashrc file so that all ros commands are recognized. Following the instructions mentioned on this page and first tutorial should do the trick.
