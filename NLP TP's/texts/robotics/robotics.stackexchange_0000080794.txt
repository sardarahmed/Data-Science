Q:

The result of Dynamic_reconfigure tutorial not update

I have studied dynamic reconfigure to use it with my project. I had followed the tutorial until http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure/Tutorials/UsingTheDynamicReconfigurePythonClient. However, after I ran both server.py and client.py, they did not show the same results which is different to what tutorial say. The terminal that I run client.py did not print anything and for server.py terminal print once and not update anything. And after I ctr+C to exist the client.py it give me these msgs which I really confuse about it.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/beerlablinux/catkin_ws/src/dynamic_tutorials/nodes/client.py", line 15, in 
rospy.wait_for_service("dynamic_tutorials")
File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospy/impl/tcpros_service.py", line 159, in wait_for_service
raise ROSInterruptException("rospy shutdown")
rospy.exceptions.ROSInterruptException: rospy shutdown
I try to find out the solution in Q&A and follow this http://answers.ros.org/question/217402/request-update-in-dynamic-reconfigure-tutorial/ but it still be the same.
Sorry for my English and please help me.
I use ROS kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

A:

I have just found the solution.
In server.py, line 14
 rospy.init_node("dynamic_tutorials", anonymous = True)

I have changed anonymous = False. And in  client.py, line 15
  rospy.wait_for_service("dynamic_tutorials")

I have change "dynamic_tutorials" to "dynamic_tutorials/set_parameters"
Everything work!!
