Q:

Install ROS Package Globally

I was wondering if it was possible to install a ROS package from source globally via catkin_make install? i.e., I would want the package installed into the /opt/ros/indigo/... location instead of the catkin workspace. The use case is for a package not in the build farm that we wanted all users on our robot to have access to.

A:

You can change the install location as for any CMake project (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.12/cmake.html#variable%3aCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) by passing:
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/install/path

This had been working for me historically. However, it seems as of late catkin is not respecting the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option. Is this a regression? I'm running the latest version of Indigo as of 4/24/15.

OK. I have this sorted out now. It seems as though you need to specify the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when calling the install target instead of at compile time, which is what used to work. No big deal, just unexpected.
