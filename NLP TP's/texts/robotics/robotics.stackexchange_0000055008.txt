Q:

How to stop beeping sound from pioneer mobile robot and start the robot without pressing a push button?

Ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte
Pioneer P3-DX
Hi,
I have two simple questions about the settings on pioneer mobile robot
Question 1:
The pioneer robot is giving a beep when it does not recieve any command from the joy stick. It does not give a beep when it receives commands to move. Could any tell how to change these beep settings ?
Question 2:
I have to press a push button on the top of Motors to start the pioneer after reset. Is it possible to not press the push button and yet get the pioneer mobile robot to move ?

A:

I'm assuming you are using p2os. Have a look at http://wiki.ros.org/p2os_driver?distro=groovy. Unfortunately, it's somewhat broken and inconclusive.

Are you talking about the startup beep? If so, it may be possible to turn it off by launching with pulse=1.0. Don't know about any other beeps, unfortunately.

What I used to do is launch a script which would publish once on the /cmd_motor_state topic. So you'd do rostopic pub /cmd_motor_state p2os_driver/MotorState 1 (1, if I remember correctly, means 'enable' - too bad the documentation doesn't actually say what the values are expected to be)

Thanks!,
For the second point, it it possible to have a command in launch file?

I made an p2os_enableMotor node which publishes to /cmd_motor_state which I run in the launch file.
