Q:

ros tutorial file not found

I am currently doing the  following ros tutorial on understanding nodes
(http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes)
For this tutorial it is using a lightweight simulator
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials

But when I  am typing this code it is saying
 bash: indigo: No such file or directory
kindly help!

A:

It's ros-indigo-ros-tutorials, not ros-<indigo>-ros-tutorials.
This is clearly (well perhaps not) stated in the tutorial text:

Replace '<distro>' with the name of your ROS distribution (e.g. hydro, groovy, electric, fuerte etc.)

Note it instructs you to replace <distro>, including the < and > characters.
