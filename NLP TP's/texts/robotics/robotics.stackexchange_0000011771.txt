Q:

Dynamics of a 3R planar robot manipulator,matrices M(q),C(q,q') and G(q)

The dynamics equation is T=M(q)*q''+C(q,q')*q'+G(q).
Can somebody provide me with the M(q), C(q,q') and G(q) matrices of a 3R manipulator with link mass,length and rotational inertia m_i, l_i and Inertia_i respectively?

A:

The simplest approach for deriving the dynamics equation of the manipulator is via Lagrangian approach. I've hand-written in a hurry the equations that you need to start computing the Lagrangian equation in the following picture and I leave the rest for you:
