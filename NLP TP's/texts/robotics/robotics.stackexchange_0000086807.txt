Q:

ROSBAG with points cloud

Hello everyone,
I have a rosbag file contain images and measurement point list. I have already extracted images.
There is a topic of type datatypes/scan_point_list_2202
And I have no idea from where to start. I need to extract point cloud. Please refer me some useful links/tutorials so that I can get an idea how to extract this information.
Thanks and Regards,
ARM

A:

datatypes/scan_point_list_2202 looks like a custom message type, the standard ROS point cloud message are sensor_msgs/PointCloud or sensor_msgs/PointCloud
If you look in the msgs folder of the package that defines this custom message you should find the definition of it.
