Q:

Float64[9] covariance array in C++

I am trying to fill in an IMU message, and it requires 3 arrays of Float64's.
How can I fill such an array in C++, initializing the first element with value -1 and the other values 0.
The documentation of the message can be found here:
http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Imu.html
I know the C++ double type should be the same as ROS Float64. This doesn't help me much unfortunately, I can't find any way to correctly initialize this array.

A:

Here's an example of values of the IMU message covariance array being filled: UM7 driver main.cpp. I think this example should clarify it nicely.

Thank you, the line you linked to was the solution! For completeness that line is below:
imu_msg.linear_acceleration_covariance[0] = -1.0;
