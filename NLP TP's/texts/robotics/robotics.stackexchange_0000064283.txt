Q:

export data in bag file using rqt_bag

Hi all,
I am trying to extract sensor and images data that saved in a bag file and save them into csv and image (png?) respectively.
For old rxbag, it can be easily done by following:
Select the range of the data we want,
Plot the sensor data, right click the plot and save into csv.
Show the image and there is a button to save the images.
However, I cannot find those option in the rqt_bag.
Thanks very much

A:

I don't believe either of these features have been implemented in rqt_bag yet. Sorry.
You can file a feature request here: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues
If you feel these features are very important, consider implementing them yourself and opening a pull request.
