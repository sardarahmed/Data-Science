Q:

GPS readings getting swapped

Two of my GPS readings get swapped as follows:
I have a robot (named raven) which runs a gps and uses the gpsd_client and utm_odometry to publish on a topic named raven_gps_odom. Similarly I have a laptop(named uav) which runs another gps and publishes on laptop_gps_odom. The laptop's ROS_MASTER is set to raven and the two run on the same network. The config files are  here .
When I do a  rostopic echo laptop_gps_odom  and  rostopic echo /raven_gps_odom  several times consecutively I find that their gps readings get swapped every 10 seconds or so.
Why is this so?

A:

It doesn't look like you are remapping the output topics from the gpsd_client. Since they are using the same rosmaster, you are publishing from two different drivers on the same topic.
You should remap both of the outputs for each gpsd_client and the appropriate inputs to utm_odometry. Another option would be to run both sets in their own namespaces.
