Q:

libboost1.46-all-dev

I am doing an install on LMDE, which uses the latest debian repositories. rosinstall fails when it cannot install libboost1.42-all-dev. libboost1.46-all-dev is available in the repository. Is there any way to get rosinstall to use the updated package? Or do I have to find and install all of the libboost1.42-all-dev dependancies?

A:

Figured it out myself.
Had to change the rosdep.yaml file in the ros package.
Changed the dependancy from libboost1.42-all-dev to libboost1.46-all-dev. That was all that was needed.
Hopefully it saves someone else hours of headache :-P
