Q:

When do I need to install python-rosinstall?

I use ROS fuerte before.
Now I want to use ROS groovy on the same laptop.
I found that I can run rosinstall command now, but I also can install python-rosinstall.
What's their difference?
When is the case to install python-rosinstall?
I run rosinstall:
  sam@sam:~$ rosinstall 
  
  usage: rosinstall [OPTIONS] INSTALL_PATH [ROSINSTALL FILES OR DIRECTORIES]
  see: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosinstall
  
  Common Option:
  -n or --nobuild (don't perform a 'make core_cools' on the ros stack)
  
  Type 'rosinstall --help' for usage.
  
  Common invocations:
  
  initial checkout:   rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=ros-full&overlay=no"
  subsequent update:  rosinstall ~/ros
  
  
  sam@sam:~$                                          

I run sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
  sam@sam:~$ LANG=C
  sam@sam:~$ sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall

A:

Did you install rosinstall using pip in the past? If so, you want to remove it, and move to the version found in python-rosinstall.

The pip installer was an approach tried, and then abandoned. Newer versions of rosinstall have not been distributed via pip for quite some time. If the old version isn't acting up, you're probably fine to continue using it, but if you use rosws or wstool (the catkin replacement), these depend on ...

python-rosinstall. And MOST IMPORTANTLY, do not install python-rosinstall without first removing the pip version -- or you'll end up with all sorts of impossible to debug errors because the new stuff is still finding parts of the old stuff...
