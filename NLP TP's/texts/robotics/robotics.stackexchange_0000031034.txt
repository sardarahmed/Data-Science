Q:

Can I "overload" topic names in ROS? (Different versions by datatype)

Can I advertise a topic with one name and two versions depending on the data type being transferred?
Specifically, the pointcloud_throttle node is hardcoded to a depth-only pointcloud, and I'm going to extend it to a RGB cloud as well. I want to know if i can just
pub_ = nh.advertise("cloud_out", 10);
pub_ = nh.advertise("cloud_out", 10);
Or if i need to come up with a separate topic name, etc.
