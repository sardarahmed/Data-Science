Q:

Get a callback on a frame apparition

Hi everyone,
I would like to get a callback when I got a specific frame.
I already test this method but it requires a defaut topic that i don't require:
point_sub_.subscribe(nh_, "scan", 10);
tf_filter_ = new tf::MessageFilter<sensor_msgs::LaserScan>(point_sub_, tf_, "laser", 10);
tf_filter_->registerCallback( boost::bind(&TeleopRoboteq::msgCallback, this, _1) ); 

Can I subscribe to tf and trigger the message filter like a normal topic (instead of laser in my exemple)?

A:

I'm not sure what you mean by "triggering the message filter like a normal topic". You can use the MessageFilter for any topic with a Header.
You can also create a tf::MessageFilter with an unused topic and programatically add data to it via it's API.

Actually I don't need any topic beside tf. I have to do a transform when a frame appear. it look like I need a mix between messagefilter and waitfortransform.
