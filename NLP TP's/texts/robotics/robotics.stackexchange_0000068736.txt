Q:

hokuyo at /dev/ttyACM0 change default settings

Hi everyone,
With our robot we are using a single hokuyo laser scanner for obstacle detection.
As software we are using ROS-Hydro and the Hokuyo node here. We got everything working, but startup is kinda cumbersome:

Depending on order of bootup the hokuyo will be either /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyACM1, so we created a udev rule to always have it at /dev/sensors/hokuyo.
Therefore we always need to set the port before starting up: rosparam set hokuyo_node/port /dev/sensors/hokuyo (taken from here )

Of course, this is scriptable, but I'm looking for a better way to change this in some configuration file or similar.

Use a launch file. Check out the roslaunch docs for further information.
