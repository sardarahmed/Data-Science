Q:

ROS package for 4-DOF Arm

I am looking at making my own 4 DOF arm. I see that there was a package "move_arm" that handled motion planning and servo control for an arm, that was made for ROS Groovy.
Would there be any modern options that exist? If not, where should I get started when trying to make something that handles the IK and motion planner?

Starting point: http://moveit.ros.org/

A:

move_arm was part of arm_navigation, which has long since been deprecated.
Its (spiritual) successor is moveit.
