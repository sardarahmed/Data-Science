Q:

Publish to topic via launch file

Is it possible to publish to a topic with a custom message type from within a launch file?
In a launch-file I launch several robots from external packages which I want to register to my running platform as they are launched.

A:

You can run rostopic pub from within a launch file with:
<node pkg="rostopic" type="rostopic" name="rostopic" args="pub {pub args}"/>

where {pub args} are the arguments to rostopic pub to make it publish the way you want it to.
You may also want to change name="rostopic" to something specific to each robot, if there will be multiple copies of this running with the same ros master.

Hi, please can you help me,i have project arm robot with ROS in Raspberry, i know how run two arduino same time but i need publish different valor of just each topic , the commade is :
rostopic pub servo4 std_msgs/UInt16 180
<node pkg="rostopic" type="rostopic" name="rostopic" args="pub {pub args}"
How can I use that ? For example, the arm needs the initial position of this arm to be 6 degrees  of liberty. We need to publish six different topics. i thinking this parameters but i don't know if this is true :
pkg = rostopic
type = pub servo4
name = std_msgs/UInt
args = entre 0  to 180
