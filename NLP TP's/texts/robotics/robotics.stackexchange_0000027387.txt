Q:

How to resize joint arrows

Is there some way to decrease the size of the joint arrows? I'm modelling parts that are less than a cm, and the arrows seem to render about 5 cm in diameter, causing them to blot out my model.

Unfortunately, right now the joint visuals have a fixed size.
Please follow this issue to see when this is improved.
