Q:

unable to transform pos constraints to odom_combined

I tried to change "move_arm_simple_pose_goal.cpp"
http://www.ros.org/wiki/move_arm/Tutorials/MoveArmPoseGoal
I wanted to specify pos and orientation and changed
desired_pose.pose.orientation.w = 1.0 -> 0.5  (line31)
Then there's error message
[ERROR] [1311149512.607969220, 1281.101000000]: Unable to transform pose constraint on link 'r_wrist_roll_link' to frame 'odom_combined'
[ERROR] [1311149512.608135351, 1281.101000000]: Could not prepare planning environment
How can I fix it or change r_wrist_roll_joint's orientation?

A:

You need to provide a proper quaternion. Just changing one value will obviously leave the quaternion unnormalized.
There are some convenience functions that create quaternions from roll,pitch,yaw depending on what you need.
