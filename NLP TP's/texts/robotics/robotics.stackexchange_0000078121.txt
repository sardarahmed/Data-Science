Q:

Does ROS Tango work?

It's been a couple years and I have come back to see if ROS Tango works.  Unfortunately, the tutorials fail miserably, requiring old versions of everything from Android Studio 0.6 to unsupported gradle versions and plugins. Even with those it generates run-time errors.
The tutorials page has not been updated since September, 2014, so I think it is an abandoned project.  That's too bad, as it would be a useful thing to have working.  Does anyone have a Tango that has a ROS interface?

This is a bit of a 'me too' comment, but I've not seen any development in that direction either. It's definitely a shame, as Tango devices are very interesting. I'd be interested to see whether you get any more informative responses, especially since the OSRF worked on Tango with Google.

See OSRF Blog - Project Tango Announced fi.

I remember i was able to send my pointcloud and position over wifi using the yellowstone tablet. I could not merge the RGB data with the pointcloud though. If this is what you are looking for I could search what tutorials I used.

A:

Take a look around here: http://wiki.ros.org/tango_ros_streamer.
That is an Android application that will publish Tango data to ROS topics. The core of that application is a ROSJava node that you can integrate into another application (http://wiki.ros.org/tango_ros_streamer/tango_ros_node).
The code of the application is open source, and you can install it into your Tango enabled device from the Play store for free.
A bit late, but hope it helps!

That works, but not for the orginal Tango development kit.  For an explanation of why it fails for that, see this link:

@dan previous releases of the application used to work with the development kit; I've used them myself. Don't expect them to be feature-complete nor completely bug-free, but they work.
Take a look here: https://github.com/Intermodalics/tango_ros/releases, download the apk and install it with adb.

@jubeira Great call!  It works with this version of tango_ros_streamer:
https://github.com/Intermodalics/tango_ros/releases/tag/v1.0-15
