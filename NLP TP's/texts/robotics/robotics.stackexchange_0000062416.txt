Q:

sicktoolbox baud rate

Hello,
I am using UDOO board and a sick lms 200. I get an error when i run the sicktoolbox_wrapper which says "failed to detect baud rate". If not that the program waits indefintely at startup.

***  Attempting to initialize the Sick LMS...
Attempting to open device @ /dev/ttyUSB0

the program waits here forever or it says "failed to detect the baud rate". I've tried the same serial to usb converter cable on my x86 machine and it works perfectly. I sometimes get the following error
" *** Attempting to initialize the Sick LMS...
Attempting to open device @ /dev/ttyUSB0

You have two open questions and an open bug about your problems already. Please update those before asking a new question.

sorryy.. forgot to update them.

A:

yup got it working. I ripped open the usb-serial converter that i had been using and turns out the chip inside was of some chinese make and wasnt compatible with the ftdi_sio module. After a while i remembered that i had an old serial to ttl logic converter which also happens to be a serial-usb converter. It uses a silabs chip compatible with cp210x. Although i was quite skeptical since it uses a max232 IC  to convert the serial signal to ttl levels. But anyhow i connected it and it worked right away.
On a side note though, will the max 232 IC cause me to miss some scans??

Requesting partial scan data stream..
Why does it say partial scan?..

Most of the max232 series of ICs have a rated baud rate. As long as you stay below that, you shouldn't lose any data.

I'm not sure what that message means. It may be normal. Do you think it's causing problems?

No not really.. hopefully wont be a problem. Just wanted your say on this.
