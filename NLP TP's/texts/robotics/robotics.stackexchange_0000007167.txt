Q:

Is this rubber/PVC coupling a good enough for small torque (0.1 N.m)

I am working on a project that involves speed regulation of a BLDC motor under no-load and load conditions. I wish to use another machine operated as generator, acting as load on the motor, as shown in this video. 
The coupling used in this motor/generator arrangement looks handmade out of a rubber tube or somethhing. I am considering using it as an alternative to a flexible coupling. Purchasing an actual flexible coupling is not an option for me. Moreover, I need the coupling on an urgent basis. 
My question is, can this arrangement (or something similar) be used to couple a 15W motor to a similar rating machine, if the rated torque is not exceeding 0.1 N.m?

A:

Absolutely, I use this method all the time for small robots, and actuators. I can find no information on the formal torque ratings, but I did find in a document called "PVC Piping Systems: Helpful tips for Avoiding Problems" 

The recommended best practice is to use a thread sealant (not a thread lubricant) and to assemble
  the joint to finger tight plus one and one-half turns, two turns at the most. Finger tight can be
  defined as: tightened using the fingers, no tools, to a torque of about 1.2 to 1.7 foot-pounds (1.7
  to 2.3Nm).

I am assuming the pipe can withstand the torque of tightening threads. I suspect that tie pipe can withstand much more torque than that though.
