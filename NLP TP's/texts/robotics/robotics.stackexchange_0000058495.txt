Q:

GPS INS navigation

Hi Guys,
I am new with ROS and would like to implement autonomous outdoor navigation using GPS/INS device. I have a differential wheel robot and I can now control it remotely in ROS. Can you give me an idea which pkg to use and how to proceed in order to be able to implement autonomous outdoor navigation using GPS/INS device?
Thx

Hi,
You could use Robot Localization http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization.  There is a tutorial on how to connect with your gps: http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization/Tutorials/GPS%20Integration
