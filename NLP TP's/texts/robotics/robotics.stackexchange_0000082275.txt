Q:

Load intrinsic parameters from file [ueye]

Hi,
I got an issue with loading parameters from a file while starting the ueye-node.
First I configured the parameters from the commandline and than dumped it in a file. I used the following command:
rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam dump /camera <file-name>

I can change this file in an editor and load it back via the load command.
So, now my issue. Is there a possibility to store the file in a specific folder so that the node loads these parameters at startup?
When the ueye-node starts, there is a warning saying:
Failed to load intrinsics for camera from file
However, I do not know where and in what format the file must be saved.  Does somebody has any idea?

A:

Parameters (dynamic or not) can be loaded from a file in roslaunch: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/rosparam
Camera calibration and intrinsics are separate. The intrinsics are stored in a configurable folder. This is purely used to dewarp the image using nodes like image_proc and others. This file is auto-generated with a calibration procedure involving a checkerboard.

Thank you for your prompt and comprehensible reply. Now, the difference between parameters and intrinsics is crystal clear.
