Q:

What is SimpleActionServer and SimpleActionClient for ros2?

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. Is there SimpleActionServer and SimpleActionClient implementation for ros2? I found nav2_util::SimpleActionServer, but it's not working for some reason right now on my system so I don't know if it works like actionlib::SimpleActionServer from ros1. I found nothing about SimpleActionClient for ros2. I'd appreciate any help, especially if you could give an example.

A:

Currently, no, there is no simple action server / client in ROS 2. You should use the Nav2 Utils one. There are discussions about adding it though, but TBD on that being released.
