Q:

Playback of large compressed bag with /clock

I am having a strange issue.
When I try to play a compressed bag file it looks like the clock deadlocks and stops publishing to /clock.  All other topics though seem to be published fine.
Playing back the original uncompressed bag works fine.
eg. rosbag play --clock compressed.bag  - clock stops,
rosbag play --clock original.bag  - plays fine
Is anyone else seeing anything similar?

Could you provide a downloadable bag file where this occurs?

This seems to be a bug (https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/82) in rostopic.
