Q:

New errors in camera_pose_calibration

My old question:
http://answers.ros.org/question/115111/errors-in-camera_pose_calibration-launch-for-3-kinects/
A possible solution from an older one:
http://answers.ros.org/question/43035/errors-on-camera_pose_calibration-startup/
I cloned this repo and put in in a folder ahead of the others in my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  The original camera_pose is there but I think it's been superceded.
https://github.com/jbohren-forks/camera_pose
Now I'm getting new errors:
[ERROR] [1389648551.704498369]: Failed to load nodelet [/aggregated_image_viewer] of type [image_view/image]: Unable to load plugin for transport 'raw', error string:

These are the current errors I'm getting.  If anyone has ideas, I'd love to hear them?  Or alternatives to multiple Kinect extrinsic calibration in Hydro?

Do you have the image transport plugins installed ("sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-image-transport-plugins")? Answer is probably yes, just want to make sure.
Comment by Athoesen on 2014-01-13:
Yes, I just ran it and everything was already the latest version.  If you know of any other packages for multiple Kinects, I'm very willing to try them.

Funny enough, I think you actually have answered my question in another one from a year ago: http://answers.ros.org/question/50091/image-transport-issue-in-rviz-groovy-beta-1/  I'm betting it's having Fuerte on my package path. Let me know if you think this is it, although I only added share/stacks.
