Q:

Strange thing in the early "building a ROS package" tutorial

I am running ROS Indigo under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
I am following the tutorials (beginner level), with quite no deviations.
At this point of this tutorial about packages instructions say:

You should see that there is a folder
called beginner_tutorials which you
created with catkin_create_pkg in the
previous tutorial. We can now build
that package using catkin_make:
$ catkin_make

You should see a lot of output from
cmake and them make, which should be
similar to this:

What I should obtain for the tutorial is a long list of sentences.
But what I obtain is a shorter list
Base path: /home/marcor/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/marcor/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/marcor/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/marcor/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/marcor/catkin_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/marcor/catkin_ws/build"
####
####
#### Running command: "make -j8 -l8" in "/home/marcor/catkin_ws/build"
####

But no errors message. I continued to follow the tutorials with no problem at all. But today it seems I have not properly created the package beginner_tutorials. But ROS tutorials page have no explanation of this fact (the listed code is the only difference). What I made wrong? Thank you all in advance

A:

I solved it from myself. I started again all tutorials from zero (creating catkin ws) and I managed to obtain full compilation of my package: maybe I was wrong in some part of it. For the second issue (package not found) I discovered I have to write source ./devel/setup.bash in every new terminal before the roscd command into the workspace
