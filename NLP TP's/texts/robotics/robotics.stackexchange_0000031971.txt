Q:

Segmentation fault of Bumblebee2

HI, all,
I am trying to use bumblebee2.
After roslaunch bumblebee2 Bumblebee2.launch, the error is
Segmentation fault, stopping camera driver.
Could someone help me? Thank you

memcpy(&left_cam_info_.K[0], &left_K_data[0], sizeof(left_K_data));

You might want to reformat that. (use the edit link below your post)

I manage to find out what causes the error. The error was due to memcpy the calibration data into the cam_info. Does anyone have any idea why this is happening?

A:

The stereo_image_proc error suggests that you have incompatible C-turtle and Diamondback stack versions mixed together. Can you check the output of:
rosversion image_common
rosversion image_pipeline
rosversion image_transport_plugins

They should all be 1.4.x.
