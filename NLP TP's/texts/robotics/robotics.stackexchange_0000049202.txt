Q:

ROSARIA installing on fuerte

Hi Guys!
I'm having problem installing ROSARIA on fuerte.
Following tutorial How to use ROSARIA I tried
roslocate info ROSARIA | rosws merge -
but it doesn't work, so I downloaded ROSARIA with rosws set amor-ros-pkg https ... --hg.
Then I followed the tutorial steps, but rosmake ROSARIA had the following output
[rosmake-0] Starting >>> ROSARIA [ make ] [rosmake-0] Finished <<< ROSARIA ROS_NOBUILD in package ROSARIA No Makefile in package ROSARIA [ rosmake ] Results:    [ rosmake ] Built 1 packages with 0 failures.
So I guess I downloaded version for groovy?
How can I fix this and install ROSARIA on fuerte?
Thanks in advance! Any help appreciated!
Greets,
da-na

Does 'rospack find rosaria' show the correct path?
Comment by da-na on 2013-03-19:
it doesn't. As I understand there's no way for "rospack find rosaria" to show it, cause there's no manifest.xml in rosaria folder

And what about using catkin_make on your top workspace? CmakeLists.txt seems like catkin format...

A:

There's a bunch of flux around ROSARIA right now, sorry for the mess...
Try this:
rosws set amor-ros-pkg https://code.google.com/p/amor-ros-pkg/ --hg -v fuerte
If you wouldn't mind, please update the wiki if it works for you so the next person will not get stuck too. :)

thank you Dereck!
it worked for me, and since I have compiled rosaria, now I'll try to use it with PeopleBot ^^
