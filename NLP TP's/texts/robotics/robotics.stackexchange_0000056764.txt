Q:

How do I install ros-hydro-ros-comm on Arm?

When trying to install ros-hydro-ros-comm I get:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-hydro-ros-comm : Depends: ros-hydro-roslisp but it is not going to be installed

I am using the Arm instruction on the Wiki with sources at:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ahendrix-mirror/ubuntu raring main

So how do I resolve this? I noticed that rostopic did not exist and that I was missing this packages.

A:

The ARM repositories have moved to http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros . Please update your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list appropriately.
