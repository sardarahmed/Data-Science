Q:

ROS electric installation problem

I want to install ros-electric-desktop, but I get the following error:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

A:

This is an apt problem, you should be able to clean up by doing the following:
First try:
sudo apt-get autoremove

Which prunes any dependencies that were installed automatically, but might not be correct.  If that doesn't work, move on to:
sudo apt-get -f install

Which will finish any broken or cut-off installs and fix unmet dependencies.  If that doesn't work, try
sudo apt-get clean all

Which cleans up apt's working directories.
Those will generally fix all apt problems that you may have, remember to always sudo apt-get update before beginning to install anything.
