A:

The beginner tutorial series would probably be a good starting point. They teach you how to make a simple vehicle and control it with a pre-existing plugin.
Once you've mastered the main concepts in that tutorial, you could either write a Gazebo plugin to control your robot, or use ROS to do it.

Thank you for the fast answer!!
I will studie it now.
When you say "use ROS" you mean I will be able to use commands via terminal, right?
