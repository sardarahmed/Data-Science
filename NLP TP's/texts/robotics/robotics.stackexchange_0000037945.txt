Q:

transformations in ros / rviz?

hi,
i'm quite new to ros and am using rviz to display my point cloud which i have manipulated a little bit using pcl. by manipulated i only applied a voxel grid thereby reducing the number of points.
but my question is, how can i apply a transformation when using rviz? i was able to do it when using only pcl but now that i'm using ros and visualizing it all in rviz, i'm getting compiler errors for just #include pcl/common/transforms.h which is of course, stopping my transformation and translation from working.
or maybe transformations and translations are not necessary in ros? but there must be a way right?
thanks!

A:

The pcl_ros package provides transforms for PCL point clouds.
Typically, you would add a <depend package="pcl_ros"/> to your manifest.xml, then:
 #include <pcl_ros/transforms.h>
