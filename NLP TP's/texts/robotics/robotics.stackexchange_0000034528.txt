Q:

what should I install to use kinect in the environment of ros(electric) besides openni_kinect?

Hi,everybody! I got problem in using rviz to display the image from kinect.I installed openni_kinect to drive kinect, but once I run rviz to display PointCloud2 data, my computer crashed. How can I record the PointCloud2 data and display it on the rviz? Is there anything I should install besides openni_kinect?

Pls give details on system configuration used.

A:

So this is really an issue with RVIZ then. Do you have an NVIDIA graphics card? Are restricted drivers installed? You might check here: http://ros.org/wiki/rviz/Troubleshooting
