Q:

rgbdslam: How to get transform between poses?

Hello,
I'm trying to learn more about the general concept of rgbdslam. Let's say I found a rigid body transformation (represented by a 4x4 matrix) between two consecutive frames (more precisely, between the feature sets of these, if I understand correctly) by using RANSAC, how can I use this to calculate the transformation that represents the change in pose between these two frames?
Thanks in advance!

A:

It is the inverse. The features are in the respective coordinate frames of the camera positions. So a transformation that moves the features from the first camera coordinate system to the second moves the second camera pose to the pose where it was in the first frame.
Edit: Correction.

But if the camera moves towards some features (so that they come nearer, their z values decrease), then the feature-transform would be one that moves every point in opposite z direction. But the position of the camera itself (seen from a global coord. sys.) would have moved forward in this example.

Yes, you are right, it is vice versa.
