Q:

How to Calculate pose of a component quickly

Dear all,
I'm newbie in gazebo simulator. I'm little confused how to fill the exact value for < pose > tag of link.
Is there any simple way to do it? I looked for pose calculation around but no deep answer.
Please help me. Thanks so much.

A:

Ahh, the current method to calculate the pose of each link is cumbersome. The pose of each model is in the global frame, and the pose of each link is in the model frame. You currently have to calculate the poses by hand.
Here is an issue to make pose calculations a bit easier.
