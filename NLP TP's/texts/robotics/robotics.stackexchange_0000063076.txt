I  installed ROS Fuerte Turtle on Ubuntu 12.04 of linux system. Thank you all the same !

A:

This error appears if the ROS environment is not set correctly when starting QtCreator. The most frequent reason is if you started QtCreator from one of the Ubuntu menus or a desktop link. The solution is easy: Either start from a ROS environment enabled terminal, or create a dedicated desktop file. Both options are described in detail on the IDEs ROS wiki page.
