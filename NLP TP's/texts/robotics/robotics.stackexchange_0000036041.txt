Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Unary stack

I have successfully wrapped an external library into ROS framework following instructions in the tutorial. However, I have used a stack and a package to acheive this. I would like to switch to using a unary stack instead. I am not sure about how to create a unary stack. I do not use CMakeLists.txt in my package for wrapping the external library and as such CMakeLists.txt files in stack and package are not a problem. However, what should be done about the Makefile(s) in stack and package in order to create a unary stack from current stack-package. Thanks!

A:

In order to be a unary stack, just take your package and add a stack.xml file as well -- i.e. use the CMakeLists.txt and Makefile from the package.  The only thing you need to add is version information to the stack.xml or CMakeLists.txt, which is described in REP 109:
http://ros.org/reps/rep-0109.html#stack-version
This works as of Electric.

Not necessarily in general. In your case of wrapping a single external library it probably makes sense. That way the package can be released by itself.

Thanks a lot! In general, is the use of unary stacks recommended?
