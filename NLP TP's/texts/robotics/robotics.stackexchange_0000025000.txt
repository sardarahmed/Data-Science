Q:

Dynamic model of a robotic arm

I have a question regarding the dynamic model of a robotic manipulator. It is commonly written as follows:
$$
\tau = M(q)\ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} + G(q) + J^\intercal F_{ext}
$$
From what I have seen, the equation $\tau_{ext}=J^\intercal F_{ext}$ only holds true at very low velocities, so authors usually remove the velocity and acceleration terms and write:
$$
\tau = G(q) + J^\intercal F_{ext}
$$
So my question is, what happens when our task is highly dynamic with high velocities and accelerations ?

A:

The first equation is always true. So at high velocities and accelerations, you use the first equation. See this

At low velocities $\dot{q}<<$ and low accelerations $\ddot{q} <<$, the first two terms are negligible, and thus you use the last equation.

$\tau_{ext} = J^T F_{ext}$ is also always true. It is the contribution of external forces. See this

There are control laws, when you want to exert a desired force $F_d$ at the environment, when the end effector does not move (thus $\dot{q}=0$ and $\ddot{q}=0$):
$$\tau_{control} = J^T F_{d}$$
and this can be even more precise if you add the gravity term. This leads to your last equation. See this
