Q:

"class ROSBAG_DECL Bag" in bag.h

Will some one please explain me this syntax of defining the class in bag.h
The reason why I have asked this question is - I am facing problem to create a variable/instance/reference to this class.
I don't have much exposure to c++.
Any help would be appreciated.

This is really a C/C++ question rather than a ROS one. In the future: please try to find a more appropriate forum for these kind of questions.
As to what ROSBAG_DECL is: it's a macro that configures visibility of the declaration / definition that follows it. See ros_comm/tools/rosbag_storage/include/rosbag/macros.h for what it does specifically, and see gcc/wiki/visibility for general info about symbol visibility.
