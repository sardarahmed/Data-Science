Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: kubuntu + ROS

Was ROS tried on Kubuntu? I am considering installing Kubuntu 11.04 and would be happy to know if anybody tried ROS in this or similar versions of the OS
Thank you

That should work without a problem. Kubuntu is just normal Ubuntu + KDE, and ROS works on Ubuntu 11.04.
