A:

hector_slam provides localization and mapping capabilities and does not perform detection and tracking of QR codes. These two tasks are performed mainly by the hector_qrcode_detection and hector_object_tracker packages. We have not released extensive documentation or tutorials for those, but launch files used on our Hector UGV robot for this video are available (here and here). See also the Hector Open Source Modules overview paper for some high level information on which components are responsible for which task.

You have to remap topics as done in the qrcode_detection.launch file linked above.

Thanks for your time dear Stefan, I want to detect Qr code by usb camera(/dev/video0), what i must to do?

You have to run a camera driver that provides images via ROS topics, basics are for example described here: http://wiki.ros.org/camera_drivers

I have detected the QR codes with visp_auto_tracker in which the data in the QR code will be retrieved by using it.Now I want that data and coordinates to publish to mark a point in the map. What I have to modify in order to get the markers into the hector_geotiff_map.
Thanks in advance.

I have modified the code of hector_geotiff.cpp file by subscribing the qr code data and the coordinates of the detected qr code detected.Now I want to modify the geotiff_writer.cpp file in order to get the points on to the map. I dont have any idea what to do in that file.Can anyone please help me in this problem as  I have to participate in German RoboCup 2020.Thanks in advance....

Yeah, I finally got my markers on to the map using hector_slam. I can actually show the map but my points are less in order to upload an image. Thanks!!
