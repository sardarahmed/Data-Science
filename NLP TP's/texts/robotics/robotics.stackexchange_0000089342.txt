Q:

Do I have to modify CMakeLists.txt for a python node?

I try to write a python node running in my package. Before I run catkin_make and rosrun, do I have to modify my CMakeLists.txt file as we did in the case of C++ node it the tutorial at Step 3?
I am new in ROS, I use ubuntu 16.04, ROS kinetic and python 2.7
Thanks in advance!

A:

You are referring to a tutorial with roscpp, there is the same one using rospy here.
You have to modify the CmakeLists.txt in python too but not as systematically as with roscpp.
In python if you want to run a simple node with no dependencies you just have to make sure to use the command chmod +x your_node.py to get an executable that rosrun can use.
In cpp, whenever you create a node you have to create the executable from the CMakeLists.txt like that (taken from your tutorial) :
add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)

You don't need to do that in python.
But you will have to modify the CMakeList if you want to create a custom message, to use a client/server and to list all the dependencies of your package.

@Delb you are right about my tutorial reference. I read the rospy tutorial but I wasn't sure if it takes the CMakeLists.txt modification as default from the previous tutorial (roscpp).In case I want to create a custom message, client/server, list dependencies, I have follow the same steps as roscpp?

If you follow all the links from the python tutorial I gave you 'll end up creating Msg and Srv directly to the configuration of the CMakeLists.txtso yes.

One piece of advice when you are wondering those things : try, experience yourself. If you don't change the CMakeLists.txt you'll direclty see error messages if it had to be changed.
