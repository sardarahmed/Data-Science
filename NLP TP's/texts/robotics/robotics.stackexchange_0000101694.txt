Q:

ROS2 galactic - failed in running demo in RHEL

I installed ROS2 galactic in RHEL 8.5 using installation using RPM method found here:
https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/RHEL-Install-RPMs.html
When trying the example here, the listener is not printing any messages.
'ros2 topic list' and 'ros2 doctor' doesn't return to command prompt.
any idea how to troubleshoot this?
