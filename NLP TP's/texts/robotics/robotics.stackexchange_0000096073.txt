Q:

How to setup turtlebot3 on ROS Noetic

Hey guys,
Does anyone know how to setup a turtlebot3 on ROS Noetic? I've trying to follow along the tutorials on this link by exchanging kinetic with noetic:
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_setup/
but as of right now, I haven't been able to be much successful.
I'm using ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20
Thank you

I also have this problem :(

A:

This tutorial is a lot better for setting up turtlebot3 siimulation on ROS Noetic:
https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-launch-the-turtlebot3-simulation-with-ros/
Long story short, messages, the robot, and simulated worlds all need to be pulled from repositories individually.  Also there is an update needed for ~/.bashrc
Hope this helps
