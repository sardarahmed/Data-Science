Q:

Definitions of map and tf using turtlebot3

Hello, I am using turtlebot3 and SLAM.
My environment is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and ROS1 melodic.
I have the questions about /tf and /map.
I want to implement subscriber callback, but I don't know the type of the argument.
What are the map and tf type definitions and required header files?

I am using turtlebot3 and its SLAM g-mapping. I see /tf and /map on rqt_graph, but I want to subscribe to them on another node that created cpp. At this time, the subscriber created with cpp receives msg by callback, but I do not know the type of these msg.
void Callback(T msg){}

I don't know what should come in the T part.

In another terminal type rostopic info /topic_name and you can find it

A:

You can check more info of any topic/service from terminal by
rostopic info <topic_name>
`roservice info<service_name>
further more to check the structure of message you can
rosmsg show <message_name>
hope this help's you.
