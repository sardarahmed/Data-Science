Q:

What I'll need to implement for real robot instead of using gazebo plugin?

For moving robot in simulated world I'm using differential_drive_controller gazebo plugin, but I wonder what it'll be needed to implement for real custom robot for moving it in real world.

A:

The Gazebo plugin takes in the Twist message and turns it into a virtual left motor and right motor command to make the simulated robot move in the simulation.
Your real robot code will need to take in the Twist message and turn it into a real left motor and right motor command to make the real robot move. The details of that really depends on your robot hardware.

@Kurt Leucht, thanks for your response. Do you know where I can see some examples of it?

How to command motors completely depends on your hardware.  What is your hardware?  How do you intend to send commands to your motors? What is the hardware device that you need to send commands to?
