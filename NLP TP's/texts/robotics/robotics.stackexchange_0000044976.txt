Q:

ROS fuerte on OSX fails on rxtools build

I follow the instrutions on http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
In the make step, after cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF
it stops at
[ 60%] Built target test_rosbag_genpy
Linking CXX shared library ../../lib/librxtools.dylib
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:

make[2]: *** [lib/librxtools.dylib] Error 1
make[1]: *** [rx/rxtools/CMakeFiles/rxtools.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
All previous steps has been followed without errors. Is there anything I am missing?

A:

reinstalling wxPython and using the latest version, instead of the one linked to in the guide solved the problem. This is just a note to others having the same problem.

I can't accept my own answer as the correct answer, becuase my karma is too low. So if anyone with enough karma could close the question, so it won't show in the unanswered list?
