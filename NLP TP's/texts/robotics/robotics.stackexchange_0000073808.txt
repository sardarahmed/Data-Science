Q:

Adding new robots in robots section

Hello,
How can we add a new robot in ROS Wiki's Robots category?
We can see many robots under http://wiki.ros.org/Robots.
When we click on any of the robots (for ex. "RobotXYZ"). It takes me to a page  http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/RobotXYZ.
My question is... How do can we have our robot page appear under Robots category?

A:

You'll need to get a wiki account, then you can edit that page or any other page. Here is how you sign up http://wiki.ros.org/FAQ#How_do_I_get_a_Wiki_account.3F_Can_I_edit_pages_on_ROS.org

Once you're created a wiki page for your robot, edit the Robots page to add a link for your robot. You can see how this is done in the raw view of http://wiki.ros.org/Robots

Note that this has been moved to robots.ros.org and now has a contribution guide
