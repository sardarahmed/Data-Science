Q:

Catkin Problems on sourcing workspaces

Hi,
I am currently trying to source multiple catikin workspaces but I mostly get only one to work, which is the
last one I include.
What is the problem there?
It was working most of the time but, right now it does not anymore.
When it was working I always had to include one workspace after another one.
If I reverted the order only one of them was found.
But now I am always getting only one workspace to work.
Any idea what's the reason for that?
Thanks!

A:

It should never have worked with multiple workspaces.
You can only source one workspace at a time.
If you want to use multiple workspaces in one, you have to overlay these, i.e. source the dependent workspace at built time before the first build.

Ah yes I found that out now too, I need to source the one first which was built first. Because the second one depends on the first one when it was sourced on build time. I just adjusted my build script for that and now it seems to work.
