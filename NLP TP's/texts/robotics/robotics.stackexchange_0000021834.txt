Q:

Doubt regarding a slam parameter in research paper

I was reading about the SLAM problem in a research paper, Multi-robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using Particle Filters by Andrew Howard.
What does '$m$' mean here?

The SLAM problem for a single robot is treated as follows.
Let $x_{1:t}$ denote a sequence of robot poses at times 1, 2, ...t,
let $z_{1:t}$ denote a corresponding sequence of observations, and let
$u_{0:t−1}$ denote the sequence of actions executed by the robot.
Our (intermediate) aim is to compute the posterior probability
$p(x_{1:t}, m | z_{1:t}, u_{0:t−1}, x_0)$ over the robot trajectory
$x_{1:t}$ and map $m$, given some initial pose $x_0$. We write this as
the product of two factors:
$p(x_{1:t}, m | z_{1:t}, u_{0:t−1}, x_0) = p(m | x_{1:t}, z_{1:t},
> u_{0:t−1}, x_0)p(x_{1:t} | z_{1:t}, u_{0:t−1}, x_0)$.

A:

m is an abstract representation of the map. In practice, m typically is some form of parametric model, whose parameters need to be estimated. Some very typical models:

A set of point locations of objects in space. m becomes a vector of (x,y,[z]) coordinates (each for one object).

A grid of cells which can have distinct states, in the simplest form just free/occupied. m becomes a vector of cell states (which each refer to a certain part of 2d/3d space).

The formula given above is a very abstract problem formulation. For actual solutions allowing calculation, it is required to choose a concrete state representation (where SLAM state = combination of environment state + robot location), as well as certain models describing the robot's(/environment's) behavior and the sensor used to observe.
