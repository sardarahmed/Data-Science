Q:

How to use/activate move_slow_and_clear?

I want to use move_slow_and_clear recovery behavior but there is very limited documentation on it.
Could someone help me with the setup required to activate or use the recovery behaviour?

Have you looked at the source code to understand behaviour: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/noetic-devel/move_slow_and_clear/src/move_slow_and_clear.cpp?
To use it:
~/clearing_distance (double, default: 0.5)
The radius away from the robot in meters inside of which obstacles will be cleared.
~/limited_trans_speed (double, default: 0.25)
The translational speed in meters/second the robot will be limited to while executing this recovery behavior.
~/limited_rot_speed (double, default: 0.25)
The rotational speed in radians/second the robot will be limited to while executing this recovery behavior.
~/limited_distance (double, default: 0.3)
The distance in meters the robot must move before the speed restrictions are lifted.
~/planner_namespace (string, default: "DWAPlannerROS")
The name of the planner to reconfigure parameters on. Specifically the max_trans_vel and max_rot_vel parameters will be reconfigured within this namespace.

These are parameters which can be adjusted, I know. But how can one enable this recovery behaviour? Moreover, it is not mentioned here: http://wiki.ros.org/nav_core#RecoveryBehavior

Agree, the documentation is lacking this info. Thank you for clarifying. I see you find the answer already, where did you find it?

I have edited the wiki page to help others: http://wiki.ros.org/move_slow_and_clear#Implementation

Great contribution! Thank you.

A:

To use move_slow_and_clear or any custom recovery behavior, one needs to either append the following lines in move base params yaml file, or create a new yaml file and add it in the navigation launch file:
recovery_behaviors:
  - name: 'move_slow_and_clear'
    type: 'move_slow_and_clear/MoveSlowAndClear'
