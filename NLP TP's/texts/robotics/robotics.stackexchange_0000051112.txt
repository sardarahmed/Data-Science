A:

This usually happens when there's a dependency missing somewhere. You probably don't have all of the Ubuntu sources enabled; make sure universe, multiverse and restricted are enabled.
Try to install each of the dependencies in the error message individually and see if you can track down a particular package that's missing.
I ran a dependency check on the ROS oneiric 64-bit repository, and it looks like the repository is consistent and up to date.
