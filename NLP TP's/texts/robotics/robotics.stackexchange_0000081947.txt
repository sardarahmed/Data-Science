Q:

rqt based UI and different screen resolutions

I've created a UI using rqt, and store the UI as a perspective. My problem is that individual components in the UI don't render at the same location if a different screen resolution is used. The UI was created in 1920 x 1080, and is being viewed on a different machine with 2560 x 1440. Any thoughts to keep the layout completely fixed will be appreciated. Since a number of people are using the UI, it's hard to control the resolution at which it will be viewed.
I'm using ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04, should it matter.

A:

If you want the perspective to be "pixel-perfect" you might want to use a not maximized window. That should at least work exactly the on all resolutions which are at least of the desired size.
In general I think it would be more flexible to allow dynamic scaling of all your layout.

The main window is not maximized at launch. It just spawns with a different size at different resolutions, which means the internal plugins get pushed around at resolutions other than the one it was designed for and the interface doesn't look nice.

The resolution of the window should be saved / restored to / from the perspective file. It shouldn't change as long as the desired resolution fits onto the screen. Maybe you can describe a minimal reproducible example others can try to confirm that there is a problem.

Thanks for the quick response @Dirk Thomas.  I've added an issue/steps to reproduce on this github thread: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt/issues/123
