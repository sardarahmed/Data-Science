Q:

tf Broadcaster Tutorial error

I am following the TF tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20broadcaster%20%28C%2B%2B%29
and I just copy pasted the code from there. When I try to run it, I receive this error
undefined reference to `tf::TransformBroadcaster::sendTransform(tf::StampedTransform const&)

What should I do? Where is the problem associated to?
