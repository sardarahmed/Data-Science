ROS Wiki Indexer

Is there a public interface to all the information that the ROS Wiki indexes, other than these pages

A:

You can check the information on the wiki macros:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/WikiMacros
They depend on static files that have to be generated regularly to not become outdated.
Also see the packages (well, the source as of now):
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosdoc
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosorg
Both packages contribute to the wiki result, but the code and structure need refactoring. I might do that soon, Tully also has it on his todo list.

+1 for the existence of the rosorg stacks. I'd like to play in a roswiki sandbox.
