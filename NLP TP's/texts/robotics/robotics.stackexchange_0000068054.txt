Q:

ROS MoveIt! move_group.launch

When i try to run, the original move_group.launch file, generated by MoveIt!, i get the following error:
auto-starting new master
process[master]: started with pid [25531]

Google has no idea, I have no idea what could be the problem:)
<include file="$(find torobot_moveit_final)/launch/planning_context.launch" />
Is included in the beginning of the launch file, which loads the robot model.

This seems to be the problem: [ERROR] [1434123343.429734522]: Robot model not loaded

i just edited the post, i have the include in the beginning of the launch file. It is strange, because i didn't edited the file, it was generated by MoveIt! still, isn't working.

IT seems like some prefix like your robot name or something is missing.

A:

move_group.launch does not load the URDF itself, it uses planning_context.launch for that (from move_group.launch):
<include file="$(find your_moveit_config)/launch/planning_context.launch" />

But, planning_context.launch only loads the URDF if load_robot_description is true:
<param if="$(arg load_robot_description)" name="$(arg robot_description)" textfile="/path/to/your.urdf"/>

and by default, load_robot_description is false, so planning_context.launch doesn't load it.
If you look in demo.launch, you'll see this:
<!-- Load the URDF, SRDF and other .yaml configuration files on the param server -->
<include file="$(find your_moveit_config)/launch/planning_context.launch">
  <arg name="load_robot_description" value="true" />
</include>

and finally:
<!-- Run the main MoveIt executable [..] -->
<include file="$(find your_moveit_config)/launch/move_group.launch">
  ...
</include>

So you'll have to set load_robot_description to true before you start move_group.launch. Whether you do that using rosparam set .. or by using the structure of demo.launch is up to you.

I just edited the move_group.launch file:
  <include file="$(find torobot_moveit_final)/launch/planning_context.launch">
  <arg name="load_robot_description" value="true" />
  </include>

But now it gives the following error message:
[FATAL] [1434187128.984235619]: Parameter '~moveit_controller_manager' not specified. This is  needed to identify the plugin to use for interacting with controllers. No paths can be executed.

Look at what demo.launch does with move_group.launch. There is much more going on than simply setting load_robot_description.
