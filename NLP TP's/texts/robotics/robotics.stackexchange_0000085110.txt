Q:

rosparam set not working

I wanted to change the port for joystick driver from /dev/input/js0 to /dev/input/js1 using rosparam command.
rosparam set /joy_node/input "/dev/input/js1"
But after reboot, it changed back to js0. Any idea on why rosparam command does not permanently change the port?

A:

First of all, how you're the first value is being set isn't disclosed in your question.
Second of all, according to a question that was answered about 2 hours ago (#q281646) parameters are not stored anywhere. Once rosmaster is shut down all of the parameters are gone. You have to reset the parameters every time you start rosmaster.
