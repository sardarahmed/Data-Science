Q:

Install from source hangs on 'pcl'

Attempting to install from source. Following the directions for installing groovy from source. (generic source installation)
OS: 64 bit Ubuntu - Quantal
Chose Desktop install (Recommended) core packages.
I have gotten as far as the step that says...
Invoke catkin_make_isolated:
$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install

Everything is working through package 144 of 153, but when it gets to pcl it errors out.
error message follows.

==> Processing plain cmake package: 'pcl'
==> Building with env: '/home/brian/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh'
Makefile exists, skipping explicit cmake invocation...
==> make cmake_check_build_system in '/home/brian/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/pcl'
==> make -j2 -l2 in '/home/brian/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/pcl'

<== Failed to process package 'pcl': 
  Command '/home/brian/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j2 -l2' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> /home/brian/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j2 -l2

I have tried to use option --force-cmake, and a few other things, but I have made no progress. Any suggestions on how to proceed?
