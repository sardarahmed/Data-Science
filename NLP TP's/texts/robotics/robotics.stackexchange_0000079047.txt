Q:

use rviz and urdf to simulate the differential_drive robot

I want use the rviz and urdf to simulate the differential_drive robot , and now I have got the robot model and can show in the rviz. I can publish the cmd_vel to let the robot move ,but here is the problem : that I move the robot just change the entire robot's velocity and orientation , but I want to give the individual wheel speed to receive the same goal ,so what can I do ?
please give me a hand. Thank u very much!

RViz is not a simulator. It is a visualisation tool. If you want to simulate dynamics, use Gazebo or V-REP or a similar tool.

so if I use the Gazebo,how can I move the robot by changing the individual wheel's velocity ?

hello, sorry to disturb you again , I read the diff_drive_controller  code in the github ,but have some problem with speed_limiter.cpp. I have been quiet confused with the "SpeedLimiter::limit(double& v, double v0, double v1, double dt)", how dose it work ?

I did not write that code, so I can't answer you right now. I'd advise you to open a new question.

ok,thank u

A:

It's up to you, but I'd look at gazebo_ros_control in combination with the diff_drive_controller.
re: individual wheel velocity: that's not how we typically control mobile bases, but if you want, even that would be possible.
