Q:

rosdoc generation for wiki

I use the following command to generate a package's documentation:
rosdoc_lite [name-of-pkg]

When inspecting the resulting offline documentation, I noticed that it's different from the one autogenerated for the ros wiki under the Code API tab:
http://ros.org/doc/groovy/api/[name-of-pkg]/html/index.html
In particular, the online version has all the auxiliary srv:: and cfg:: namespaces (and possibly others) hidden.
Two questions:

Is there a way to generate documentation offline which is the same as the online one?
If not, what exactly are the differences between the two?

A:

The documentation generated by rosdoc_lite should be the same as the documentation generated locally. I think the reason that you're getting the "srv" and "cfg" namespaces to show up is because you're running rosdoc_lite on a package that has been built. As such, there are a bunch of auto-generated header files that Doxygen is processing that aren't run by the automated doc system.
Do you have a specific package in mind that you're seeing this for? If I know what you're trying to replicate, I can double check that this is, indeed the case.

You're correct - running "make clean" before rosdoc_lite resolved the issue. Thanks!
