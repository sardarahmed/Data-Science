Q:

velocities transformations between frames

In my system, I have two frames.
I want to convert my velocities(x,y,z,r,p,y) in frame 1 to be represented in frame 2.
Does multiply the linear component and the angular component with the rotation matrix is correct?

A:

Yes it is. The rotation matrix of the coordinates system B relative to the coordinate system A or its inverse backwards, A relative to B.
