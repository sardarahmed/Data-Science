A:

It's possible, but simulation would be mighty slow (depending on the complexity of the humanoid robots)
Defining the soccer field would be easier. Just create a flat plane with a green texture and the appropriate lines. The goals can be modeled using cylinders and boxes.
Next, you'd have to create a humanoid model, or use Atlas. Controlling the humanoid robot is also no small feat, but definitely do-able.
Then you'd have to model the dynamics of the soccer ball. You could potentially use a Bullet soft-body.
A world-plugin could be used to keep score, and track the ball for out-of-bounds. And you could also get fancy by monitoring collisions between robots for fouls.
