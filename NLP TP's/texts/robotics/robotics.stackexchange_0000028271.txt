Q:

How to get model bounding box

Hi all,
I'm using gazebo for robotic experiments in combination with ROS.
My problem is the following: given the name of a certain model in the scene (published on a topic) I need to write a ROS node that is capable of determining the bounding box of the model.
I'm searching among the various services that gazebo exposes to ROS and I came across this. But I don't know how to extract the required information from this message.
Please, can someone tell me how this can be done?
Thanks.

A:

Not sure if this can be easily done through ROS without a Gazebo plugin.
With a Gazebo plugin, you could write a model plugin and use the physics::Model::BoundingBox() function.
