Q:

Miniproject - single instruction

Hi, i want to make this instruccion for the turtlebot:

$ turtle_walk with_SPEED with_DIRECTION

turtle_walk allows to move the motors of the turtlebot with certain speed and in certain direction, but i don want to do something like keyboard_teleop that stays in a cicle and waits for the user.
For example:

$ shh turtle@turtlebot

$ turtle_walk foo bar

And the result is that the robot was able to move it self ONE STEP no more and the terminal can receive another diferent instruction.

A:

Hi,
try it this way from bash
https://github.com/mockbot/MockBot/blob/master/mockbot/bin/cmd_vel_test.sh
You can replace static cmd_vel values by variables ($1,$2...) and customize your script .
Enjoy it :-)

Hi, this solution induces the turtlebot in a loop and the robot still without moving

It shows the basic principle. You'd need this to run in your code for as long as you define a step to be.
