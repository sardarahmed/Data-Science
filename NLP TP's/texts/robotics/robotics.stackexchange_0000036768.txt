Q:

ardrone package?

Hello all,
I recieved an AR.Drone for christmas, and I, being an autonomous robotics person, would love to use ROS to program the drone. I realize that its sensors are probably subpar, but I still want to use the stack I found here: http://www.ros.org/news/2010/10/ros-interface-for-the-parrot-ardrone.html
Unfortunately, when I tried to clone the repo with git, it appears to be an empty repository. Has this repository moved? If so, where can I find it? And, do you have any tips for a beginning ros C++ programmer for autonomous drones?
Thanks a ton,
-Hunter Allen

A:

It does appear that that package has disappeared. You should take a look at the ardrone_brown package from Brown.
They also appear to have a second stack with a controller, localization and planner for the drone.
