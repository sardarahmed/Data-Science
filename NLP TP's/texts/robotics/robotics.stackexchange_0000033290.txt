Q:

Capture for Kinect Camera

Thanks, that I have done, now I want to save the images I have listened to from to video using the video writer class,
VideoCapture cap(0); // open the default camera

However,  I don't want to use the default camera (webcam), instead the kinect camera. I have tried -1, but still won't work.
So, If someone has opened a capture using KINECT camera, that would be great if they shared with me how they did it.
many thanks

You might want to rewrite/reformat your post. It's a bit difficult to read.

A:

Hi, to open the kinect camera with OpenCV you need to use this:
VideoCapture capture( CV_CAP_OPENNI );
