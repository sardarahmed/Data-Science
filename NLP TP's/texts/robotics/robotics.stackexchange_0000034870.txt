Q:

rosjava missing library

Good evening,
I receive the following exception when trying to build rosjava:
/home/imre/ROS_DIR/rosjava_core/rosjava/src/main/java/org/ros/internal/node/RosoutLogger.java:59: package org.ros.message.rosgraph_msgs does not exist
Where can I download the package org.ros.message.rosgraph_msgs for rosjava?
I thank you in advance.
Here is my setup:
OS:
Ubuntu; Version 11.04 (natty); Kernel Linux 2.6.38-11-generic-pae; GNOME 2.32.1
Version of ROS:
At first, I had installed ROS Diamondback. And I had the error I am talking about in this question. Then I installed ROS Electric Emys in its place once it was released, but it was not due to my question. I still have the error with this version of ros.
Version of java:
java version "1.6.0_22"; OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.10.2) (6b22-1.10.2-0ubuntu1~11.04.1); OpenJDK Server VM (build 20.0-b11, mixed mode)
Version of Ant:
Apache Ant version 1.8.1 compiled on October 13 2010
Exact commands used to download rosjava:
At first I tried:
imre@TK-421:~$ svn co https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/
svn: Le serveur a envoyé une valeur inattendue (405 Method Not Allowed) en réponse à la requête OPTIONS pour 'https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg'
which means "The server has sent an unexpected value (405 Method Not Allowed) in answer to the request OPTIONS for 'https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg'"
So instead I used:
imre@TK-421:~$ wget -r -l 1000 --no-check-certificate  https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/

A:

There are multiple problems:

You have to use ROS Electric, not Diamondback (should be resolved now)

https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/ is a Mercurial repository, not subversion, so you can't use svn or wget with it.  The correct command is:
hg clone https://rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/ rosjava_core

This advice actually worked, thank you very much for your time and effort. I will post the complete answer.

The last piece of advice I can offer is try to delete ~/.ros/rosjava and then "rosmake --threads=1 rosjava".  If that doesn't work, I can only think that the system setup is not configured correctly.

I am indeed using ROS Electric now. I have also used the hg command. Now I can launch "rosmake rosjava_core". However, it fails with the  same error I sent this question for. It still misses the library I indicated in my question.
