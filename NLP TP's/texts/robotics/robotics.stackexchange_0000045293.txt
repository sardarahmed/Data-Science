Q:

rosserial_arduino chipkit32 (arduino mega)

I am running ubuntu 12.04 Virtualbox fuerte from nootrix.com on my mac. I can use mpide and compile the normal example projects and communicate with the serial in the ubuntu environment, and I can run the ROS demo's, but as soon as I try to run the demo rosserial_arduino hello world, I continuously get:
"lost sync, restarting device..."
and when i look at the serial monitor, it is gibberish. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Did you successfully upload the ROS code to the Arduino first?  Also, I found that VMWare worked a little better than VirtualBox on my x86 machine.  VirtualBox seemed to loose sync more often, and sometimes took a couple tries to get connected.

A:

Is the baudrate also correctly set on both sides? Perhaps try it first on a native ros installation (if available) and then move to virtualbox.
