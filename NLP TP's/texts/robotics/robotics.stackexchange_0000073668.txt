Q:

Are there any slam packages to get 3d position and orientation of a robot?

I would like to ask you whether or not there are some packages to get 3d position and orientation of a robot.
I am studying about legged robots and I try to have that robot climb stairs.
I am in trouble to get 3d position information especially z(height).

Maybe rgbd Slam with an imu and a good laser should be a good start.
