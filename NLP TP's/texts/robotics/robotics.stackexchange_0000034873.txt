Q:

Send data from one laptop(code blocks) to another laptop(ros packages)?

Hi im doing a project whereby my robot will be controlled remotely. But I met a obstacle. I have a Qt design over at my client side, with buttons that are supposed to control the robot, but how do I send it over to the server side which is running ros packages?

A:

The ROS solution would be to make your Qt GUI a ROS package and send messages to the client side. I would recommend to do it that way. It is fairly easy if you know Qt already.

Your Qt GUI is built with code blocks, right? You would create a ROS package with code blocks like here http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs#CodeBlocks and make it a Qt GUI. Other than creating the package for code blocks everything is standard ROS.
