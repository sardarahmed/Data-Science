My settings: echo 'JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java export JAVA_HOME PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin export PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

please can you explain why this error appears, however I install  ros-fuerte-knowrob ?!
Comment by sam on 2012-10-28:
I don't know why. Set JAVA_HOME is part of my own ROS installation process. Maybe someone knows that...

I do not Know why java at all :(
Comment by moritz on 2012-10-28:
The visualizations for KnowRob are written in Java, and some parts require JAVA_HOME to be set. For me, setting JAVA_HOME to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun works (assuming you have Sun Java 6 installed)

Comment by RiskTeam on 2012-10-29:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts
cd /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib
cd /etc
sudo vi bash.bashrc
Then I add this and save
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java export JAVA_HOME PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOM
