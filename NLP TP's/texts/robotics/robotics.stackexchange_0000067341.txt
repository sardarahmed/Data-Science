Q:

Problem about using turtlebot_arm with "pincher" argument

Hi all,
I'm using ROS indigo with Ubuntu 13.10, and the phantomx pincher arm. The arbotix version is the newest one (for indigo).
Following this link "https://github.com/vanadiumlabs/arbotix_ros/pull/28/files?short_path=04c6e90", I add something like "arm_type:=pincher" after my command. For example: roslaunch turtlebot_arm_moveit_config turtlebot_arm_moveit.launch sim:=false arm_type:=pincher --screen
The good thing is: I got the phantomx pincher model in RViz. But I also got these errors:

And the planning process was always failed:

Also, noting that the arm.launch file mentions that it's could be problematic to directly pass the "pincher" arg, I also tried changing the argument in the launch file, and the outcome didn't change (I got the same errors).
Could someone get me out of this problem? thanks!

Hi, if you can see the pitcher arm properly I suppose you are using this fork of the code, right? The pitcher arm stuff is not released still

A:

For the PhantomX Pincher arm, you will need to use these:
Arbotix fork:     https://github.com/corb555/arbotix_ros
Turtlebot_arm fork:    https://github.com/corot/turtlebot_arm  (as mentioned by Jorge, above)
I think you can't pass the arm type as a parameter as you did above.  You need to set environment variable "TURTLEBOT_ARM1" to pincher.

Thanks for your advice. I replaced my packages with yours. And I changed the  argument "pincher" in the launch file. But I still got these errors. Perhaps my way of setting environment variable "TURTLEBOT_ARM1" is wrong? Thanks for your further help!

you shouldnt need to change any of the launch files.  you should do the following before you launch:
export TURTLEBOT_ARM1=pincher
