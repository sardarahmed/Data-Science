Q:

Cannot connect ros master when run with sudo

As the title, I can run well a bag normally, but when I add sudo, it says
[FATAL] [1471510924.482740850]: ROS_MASTER_URI is not defined in the environment.

which is the same as no master exists. But I really have to add sudo to open a usb camera.

I'd actually suggest not to run anything as root (so don't use sudo). In most cases it's not necessary, and only the access rights of the user need to be changed. See Rosrun as super user fi (but there are many more).
