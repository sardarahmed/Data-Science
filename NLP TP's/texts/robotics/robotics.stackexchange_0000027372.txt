Q:

Remove the flaring edge of Moon/Earth in SkyX

Using this pull request to gazebo_models and the suggestions there, we're now holding a moonlight earthlight party using Gazebo, by simply replacing SkyX_Moon.png with an earth image included in this PR.

I think the flaring rim surrounding the earth was suitable for the moon seen from the earth, but not the other way round. Where should I edit SkyX to remove it? Thank you.

UPDATE: Thanks to @iche033's answer, we now enjoy even more serene moment.

$ diff /usr/share/gazebo-2.2/media/skyx/SkyX_Moon.fragment.org /usr/share/gazebo-2.2/media/skyx/SkyX_Moon.fragment

<   haloIntensity = pow(haloIntensity, uMoonPhase.z);
---
>   haloIntensity = pow(0.0, uMoonPhase.z);

Catch for me was that this .fragment file seems to not work right with some comment-out formats; I was trying to use # and it just didn't show the earth at all.
