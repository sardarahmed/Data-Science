Q:

Interference caused by multiple robots during task completion

Suppose there is an area to survey. If we deploy one robot it takes time T to sweep the area. Now if we deploy 2 robots, we would expect it to take time T/2. However in reality, because we are sending two robots, we would have to implement additional coordination planning routines and obstacle avoidance routines so that they do not collide with each other. These overhead computational costs add up and we will actually see the area being surveyed in time T/2+X. Now could you suggest papers where they talk about the estimation of X? It does not have to be in the context of area surveying. It can be any other multi-robot task also.

A:

I came across one paper that had a good description of this issue from Kristina Lerman and Aram Galstyan at University of Southern California entitled "Mathematical Model of Foraging in a Group of Robots: Effect of Interference"
