Q:

Subscribing to a message type regardless of the topic name

Is there a way to subscribe to all messages of a given type without knowing their topic names? It would be perfect, if the callback function could additionally see the related topic name.
My application: I would like to write a node, which is supposed to do some administrative work and therefor collects all sensor_msgs/CameraInfo messages from every camera on my robot. But I don't know how many cameras my robot has.
This question comes close to what I need, but I'd still have to maintain a list of all my cameras separately.
Any ideas?

A:

You could probably use the Master API to get a list of all publishers for a particular message type (getTopicTypes(..)). Then iterate over that and subscribe to the topics that you're interested in.
