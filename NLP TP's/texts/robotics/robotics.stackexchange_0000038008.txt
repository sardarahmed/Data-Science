Q:

Strange sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 MD5 signatures

I am working on some packages using both Electric and Fuerte (alpha). When I try to display the PointCloud2 output using rviz I get messages like this:
[ERROR] [1329681881.695481457]: Client [/rviz_1329681880853654796] wants topic /velodyne/pointcloud2 to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/PointCloud/d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca], but our version has [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2/1158d486dd51d683ce2f1be655c3c181]. Dropping connection.

On both systems, the correct MD5sum seems to be:
$ rosmsg md5 sensor_msgs/PointCloud2
1158d486dd51d683ce2f1be655c3c181

In both cases I am running the Debian binary rviz packages, not something I built myself. Any hints where to look for the d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca signature?

Looks like d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca is the default PointCloud (not PointCloud2) message signature (googling for it seems to confirm that at least). Now, why rviz mixes them up of course is the more interesting question.

A:

I think the simple explanation might be that you used a PointCloud display instead of a PointCloud2 display in rviz.

That was it. The display I had checked was "Point Cloud2 (PointCloud)", but what I intended was "PointCloud2 (PointCloud2)". Sorry for the silly question.
