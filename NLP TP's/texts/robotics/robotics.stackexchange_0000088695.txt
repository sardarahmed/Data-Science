Q:

Why ROS_Kinetic is recommended Distribution?

I upgraded to Ubuntu 18.04 and my Kinetic does not work anymore,

Unable to locate package
ros-kinetic-desktop-full

When I see list of distribution here
Why (recommended) is written infront of Kinetic ?
Why not melodic ?

A:

With Ubuntu 18.04 you should use ROS Melodic as it is primarily targeted at the Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) release. I guess when all the packages are added and since it will have a long term support it will become recommended at some point. At the moment ROS Kinetic is the most used one and has a number of packages that are probably still not ported to the newer distributions.
