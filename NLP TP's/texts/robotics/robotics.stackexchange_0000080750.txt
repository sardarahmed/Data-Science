Q:

Convert SRDF to Collada (dae)

Hi,
I have a robot model in myrobot.urdf and myrobot.srdf. Now I want to use the model in OpenRave, so I need to convert the *rdf files to COLLADA files or OpenRave xml format. With collada_urdf I converted myrobot.urdf into myrobot.dae, but it does not contain the information of manipulators (a.k.a. groups in SRDF), which is crucial for OpenRave to work. I googled a lot on how to convert SRDF to COLLADA but did not found anything. Could anyone help? Thanks in advance.

A:

It's not really conversion per se (ie: I don't think you get the output to store somewhere), but I know of or_urdf which is an OpenRAVE plugin that allows you to load urdfs and srdfs directly into OpenRAVE.
I'm not sure what pieces of an srdf it actually supports. You'll have to check that for yourself.
The Personal Robotics devs have created quite a few interesting OpenRAVE<->ROS integration tools.

Hi gvdhoorn, I did a quick check on or_urdf. It may not work perfectly for my case (due to the non-perfect mapping between SRDF and OpenRave features), but should be a good start. Thanks a lot!

Good to hear. Perhaps you can extend or_urdf and contribute back to the Personal Robotics ppl? I'm sure they would appreciate that a lot (and so would I).
