Q:

gmapping missing spots

Hello,
For our robot, slam gmapping have been configured.  However, when we display our cost maps in rviz, we see a big gapping hole that isn't being mapped

I know that there are quite a few parameters that can be set for gmapping.
Are any of these parameters responsible for this hole in our mapping?

A:

For the SICK LMS lidar you can set the "use_rep_117_" global parameter to "false" to force it to report readings in legacy format instead of using Inf/NaN. It seems that the gmapping package rejects Inf/NaN values.
Use this information in combination with the maxRange and maxUrange suggestion that Ben has offered.
