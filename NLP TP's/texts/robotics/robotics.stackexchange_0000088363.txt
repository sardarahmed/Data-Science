A:

Under Parameters in the roswiki move_base package it is stated that:
oscillation_timeout (double, default: 0.0)
How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout

This means that if the value is 0 when the robot gets stuck it will perform osculation movements(example: move few cm back and front constantly) until it gets unstuck or fails the path planning and enters recovery behaviors to get unstuck. The problem is that these osculation movements can be from few seconds to lets say 10 minutes (who knows, maybe even hours). That is why this parameter allows you to specify how many seconds do you want the osculation occur and avoid those long/infinite osculations and enter the recovery behaviors.
In some projects I have seen that this time is usual set from 3-5 seconds but it is up to the custom requirements.
