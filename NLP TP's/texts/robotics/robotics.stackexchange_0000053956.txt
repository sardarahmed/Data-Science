Q:

hector_turtlebot rosmake failed

Hello All,
I was trying to install the hector_turtlebot package from hector_turtlebot wiki. I am using ros fuerte on ubuntu 12.04.
I used the following commands to download the package and rosmake-
$ cd ~/ros_workspace
$ svn co  https://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/hector_turtlebot
$ rosmake hector_turtlebot

When running the rosmake hector_turtlebot the build failed. The rosmake output files are attached here rosmake_output
turtlebot@turtlebot:~/ros_workspace$ rosmake hector_turtlebot

Could someone please help me why the build failed and any solution to this problem. Also did anyone has successfully implemented the hector_turtlebot on their turtlebot 1 with hokuyo lidar? Please help.  Thanks..

A:

It seems you also need this package : http://wiki.ros.org/hector_sensors_description
because you can read :
 [rospack] Error: package/stack hector_turtlebot_description depends on non-existent package hector_sensors_description
