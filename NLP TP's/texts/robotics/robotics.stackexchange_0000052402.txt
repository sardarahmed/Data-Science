Q:

How to source a catkin_package?

I created a package using catkin_create_pkg dependencies only roscpp
created a node using c++ code and then edited CMakelist.txt then I used catkin_make to build it.
the next step i need to do it is to run the following to ......
source devel/setup.bash
after this I tried to run the node by
rosrun  
it showing error that can not find package
What i understand is that my package is not sourced properly to ROS?
Please tell the solution.
If i am wrong then please correct me and tell the solution.
PS: following the Prof. Jason O'Kane tutorial on ROS linked on ros.org

A:

You can source as below:
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Check if catkin_make was successful and your package is built and linked with libraries successfully. Then try using rosrun command again.
