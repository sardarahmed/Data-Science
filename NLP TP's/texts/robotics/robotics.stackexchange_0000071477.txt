I download a package rplidar_ros and launch rpliar_ros veiw_slam.launch. And then ,sometiems it could play, but sometimes it will be died. Tomorrow, it has worked well , but tonight it show error:
[hector_height_mapping-3] process has died [pid 8937, exit code -11, cmd /home/robot2/catkin_rp/devel/lib/hector_mapping/hector_mapping
__name:=hector_height_mapping __log:=/home/robot2/.ros/log/86f925ea-bf55-11e5-b64a-000c29d3d3bc/hector_height_mapping-3.log]. log file: /home/robot2/.ros/log/86f925ea-bf55-11e5-b64a-000c29d3d3bc/hector_height_mapping-3*.log

when I restart it, for a moment it broken and show:
[hector_height_mapping-3] process has died [pid 9191, exit code -11, cmd  /home/robot2/catkin_rp/devel/lib/hector_mapping/hector_mapping

A:

The height mapping node certainly isn't supposed to crash, but it is meant for a specialized application and you probably shouldn't be using it :) In any case, a backtrace would be required to get a better idea of what is going on.
What you really want is probably starting a standard mapping setup however, which should not crash in the first place.
