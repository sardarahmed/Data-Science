Q:

How to get watchdog_timer package

Hi,
I am using ROS Fuerte and am trying to find a ROS watchdog service to use in a teleoperation program.  I found the package watchdog timer on the ROS Wiki, but it does not show up in my current stacks.  I would like to download it, but can not locate it or a stack which contains it in apt-get, etc.  I would appreciate it if someone could let me know if watchdog_timer is available to download for Fuerte and how to get it or if there is another way to implement a watchdog.  Thank you.
