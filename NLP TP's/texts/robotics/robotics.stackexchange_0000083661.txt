Q:

Help Required! Changing Subscribed Topics of a Package

Greeting friends, I am currently working on a low cost method of mapping and I have decided to use ultrasonic to do it.
Ultrasonic Range Package: https://github.com/sharvashish/Obstacle_detection__HCSR04
Mapping Package: http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping
The problem is the ultrasonic publishes a "sensor" topic while the mapping subscribes to "scan".
Is there a method to make the mapping package subscribe to "sensor" instead?
Cheers, Thanks for your time.

A:

This is a question of semantics. A single measurement is not directly equivalent to a "scan", at least the the type that gmapping is looking for (LaserScan). You'll have to find (or implement) a node that converts your ultrasonic range measurements into a (poor) LaserScan msg.
