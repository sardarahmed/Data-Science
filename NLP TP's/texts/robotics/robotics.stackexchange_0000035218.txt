Q:

pr2_navigation_slam rviz_move_base_slam.launch 2d nav goal

Hello,
I'm trying to build a map on a PR2, and am not able to move the robot via the rviz "2D Nav Goal". Here are the steps I've taken:
-on the PR2:
$roslaunch pr2_2dnav_slam pr2_2dnav.launch
-on another computer:
$roslaunch pr2_navigation_slam rviz_move_base_slam.launch
-try to set nav goal:
This does not move the robot. Setting "rostopic echo move_base_simple/goal" on both the PR2 and rviz computers shows that the "move_base_simple/goal" message is being sent (ie, message shows up on both machines), but for some reason does not result in any actual movement. It almost seems like the move_base node isn't subscribed to the "move_base_simple/goal" topic.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Evan
EDIT:
This turned out to be a hostname issue, where the machine sending the message wasn't being properly resolved.

Could you say a bit more about your problem and how you solved it? I currently have the same problem on our PR2.
