Q:

do_docker.sh failing on console_bridge

I'm following the instructions for setting up ROS for Android found here.  I'm installed this on Ubuntu 14.04.  I've got this issue on a system with Android NDK/SDK already setup as well as a clean install of Ubuntu.
After some time the failure is CMake looking for console_bridge package at /usr/share/console_bridge which does not exist. I've tried finding info regarding this failure and installing console_bridge but at the moment I'm stumped.
After some time do_docker.sh fails with the following output:
-- ==> add_subdirectory(class_loader)
-- Boost version: 1.53.0
-- Found the following Boost libraries:
--   thread
--   system
CMake Error at /usr/share/console_bridge/cmake/console_bridge-config.cmake:12 (message):
  Library 'console_bridge' in package console_bridge is not installed
  properly
Call Stack (most recent call first):

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Edit: I dug further through the logs.  Looks like console_bridge is failing to compile:

A:

Sorry for the delay, I've just seen this.
We've already fixed that issue (here), it turns out, console_bridge move from using boost to using std C++11 mutex which is not currently available for the android_ndk.
If you update the repository, it should work.
