Q:

Unable to spawn Gazebo from terminal

I installed Gazebo Fortress following the instructions here on my laptop with Ubuntu 22.04. I was able to install it without any problems & I could see the app installed with the name Ignition Gazebo 6. I am able to spawn it and run shapes.sdf file.
But when I try to spawn it using gz sim shapes.sdf from here, it doesn't work. Here's the output I get:
This tool modifies various aspects of a running Gazebo simulation.

  Usage:  gz <command>

List of commands:

  help      Print this help text.
  camera    Control a camera
  debug     Returns completion list for a command. Used for bash completion.
  help      Outputs information about a command
  joint     Modify properties of a joint
  log       Introspects and manipulates Gazebo log files.
  marker    Add, modify, or delete visual markers
  model     Modify properties of a model
  physics   Modify properties of the physics engine
  sdf       Converts between SDF versions, and provides info about SDF files
  stats     Print statistics about a running gzserver instance.
  topic     Lists information about topics on a Gazebo master
  world     Modify world properties

Use "gz help <command>" to print help for a command.

A:

For Gazebo Fortress, you should use the command ign gazebo shapes.sdf. For Gazebo Garden and newer, you can use gz sim .... This is because the Gazebo project changed names from Ignition to Gazebo after Fortress was released.
