A:

I was geeting a similar error while issuing the command $rosrun json_prolog json_prolog ias_semantic_map
The result was:
find: `/jre/lib/': No such file or directory
Cannot find libjsig ... maybe you need to set JAVA_HOME?
Since I'm using the openjdk (default in Ubuntu 10.04) I did the following to get it to work.

type java -version to see that it is installed

check if have the following path /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib

if the path exists then $sudo nano /etc/bash.bashrc

add at the end of the file

JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
export JAVA_HOME
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
export PATH

save and exit

restart the terminal or open a new one and test the command (in my case $rosrun json_prolog json_prolog ias_semantic_map)
