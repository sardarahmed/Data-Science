Q:

Code::Blocks and ROS Setup - rospack export returns empty line

Hi all,
I'm trying to integrate Code::Blocks with the actionlib_tutorials package to no avail. I'm using the ROS IDEs Wiki page for Code::Blocks and I'm getting a blank line when using:

rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags PackageName

rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=lflags PackageName

I've created the package using catkin tools and have successfully run catkin build in the package root.
My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is:

/TigerBotWS/TigerBot/src/actionlib_tutorials:/opt/ros/kinetic/share

And using tree on my package looks like the following:

. ├── build
│   ├── actionlib_tutorials
│   └── catkin_tools_prebuild
├── devel
│   ├── etc
│   ├── lib
│   └── share
├── logs
└── src
│   └── actionlib_tutorials

Any idea as to why the cflags attribute from rospack export might be blank?
Thanks in advance.
(P.S. There was a previous topic about this here. The tutorial is points to did not solve my issue hence the re-post)

A:

I haven't used Code::Blocks before, so I am not sure if this creates your problem, but I am sure that your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is not initialized correctly.
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH should point to the src folder of your workspace.
For correct initialization of this environment variable do:
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash 
cd /TigerBotWS/TigerBot
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash

In addition, you could export these flags with the export tag of actionlib_tutorials/package.xml
