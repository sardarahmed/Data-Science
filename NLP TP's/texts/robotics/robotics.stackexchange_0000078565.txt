Q:

Please... Please help.
I am trying to use rplidar, but I have this error below.........
I checked the tutorial again and again but I really don't know how to fix this..
Please help me.
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws/src$ git clone https://github.com/robopeak/rplidar_ros
fatal: destination path 'rplidar_ros' already exists and is not an empty directory.

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws/src$ ls ~/catkin_ws/src

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make rplidarNode
Base path: /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/src
The specified base path "/home/ubuntu/catkin_ws" contains a CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace

After I input
 ls -al /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws

I got below!
ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ ls -al /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws

A:

ubuntu@ubuntu:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make rplidarNode

Base path: /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/src
The specified base path "/home/ubuntu/catkin_ws" contains a CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace

There is probably a CMakeLists.txt in /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws. There shouldn't be.
Can you add the output of:
ls -al /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws

to your original question? Use the edit button/link for that.

Edit:

You are right! I hace a CMakeLists.txt in /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws .

I'd use unlink:
unlink /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/CMakeLists.txt

Then try catkin_make again.

Do you think I need to delete this file? can I use mouse right button to remove this file?
