Q:

Orocos deployer as a ROS node

Hello everyone,
I would like to encapsulate an Orocos deployer into a ROS node. The deployer is an XML file that should be independant from the ROS files. I want to create a ROS node, load the XML file, and then run the node with minimal user implication (ideally the user should not notice that the node is a wrapper around Orocos).
I am looking for any ressource or example that could help me with that.
I am using the orocos_toolchain package in ROS.
Thanks
