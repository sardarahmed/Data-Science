Q:

robot setup tf setup for navigation

When I try to set an initial pose for 2d navigation RVIZ crashes on me.  When I check the tf tree, I see that odom is off to the side and not even connected.  /map connects straight to /base_link.  What am I doing wrong?

irobotcreate with a hokuyolaser.I amfollowing this tutorial http://www.princeton.edu/~ctralie/Projects/DukeDusty2/Tutorial/#navigation.I did view_frames again before I set initial pose and it seems like /odom is branching off /map now, but /base_link is branching off /map with the broadcaster /temp.

What type of robot are you using, and what packages are involved? It would sound as if your base controller/driver is publishing directly base_link to map rather than putting out an odometry.

A:

The first "temp" publisher is wrong. It says the robot does never move in the map.
Remove it totally.
The corresponding tf chain from map->odom->base_link should be produced by odometry and SLAM/localization, not a static_transform_publisher.
