Q:

Using multiple RPlidar on a single system

Hello,
i would like to use two (or more) rplidars at the same time. When i start the second RPLIDARnode, the first one closes.
I tried to find a connection to rosserial, but it seems rplidarnode doesnt use it at all.
Is there a way to run both rplidar with two rplidarnodes? What changes do i need to do?
Right now im trying to use an Arduino Microcontroller to read out the rplidar and publish its informations by using rosserial_python. At the moment this wont work out pretty well cause it needs a lot of Parameters and really big Arrays (Timing Problems)...
My goal is to use multiple rplidar for sensor Fusion :)
Regards
Dave

A:

You need to launch them in namespaces or use a different name attribute for each node and remap the topics to be different. With the namspaces you could use something like the following.
rplidar_arg.launch
<launch>
  <arg name="serial_port" default="/dev/ttyUSB0"/>
  <node name="rplidarNode"          pkg="rplidar_ros"  type="rplidarNode" output="screen">
  <param name="serial_port"         type="string" value="$(arg serial_port)"/>
  <param name="serial_baudrate"     type="int"    value="115200"/><!--A1/A2 -->
  <!--param name="serial_baudrate"     type="int"    value="256000"--><!--A3 -->
  <param name="frame_id"            type="string" value="laser"/>
  <param name="inverted"            type="bool"   value="false"/>
  <param name="angle_compensate"    type="bool"   value="true"/>
  </node>
</launch>

two_lidars.launch
<launch>
    <include ns="lidar0" file="$(find your_ros_package)/launch/rplidar_arg.launch">
        <arg name="serial_port" value="/dev/ttyUSB0"/>
    </include>
    <include ns="lidar1" file="$(find your_ros_package)/launch/rplidar_arg.launch">
        <arg name="serial_port" value="/dev/ttyUSB1"/>
    </include>
</launch>

the resulting topics would look something like, so in whatever nodes you use the scan topics in need to be listening to the correct topics:
/lidar0/scan
/lidar1/scan
