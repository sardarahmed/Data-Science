and what if i want to publish an 1 dimensional array? do i just need to include "std_msgs/Float64MultiArray.h" or do i need something else?

You can use Float64MultiArray but it might be a bit tricky because you need to give a layout definition. Have a look at the message definitions for more info. They contain some documentation. I personally think that Float64MultiArray doesn't provide enough semantics and I'd define my own message.

hm, i see.
and what do i write into my own defined message?
double arrayname[4]?

Depends on what you want to send around. Have a look at this page for data types you can use.

i want to send a 1-dim double array with the size of 4

It would be float64 arrayname[4]

A:

The tutorials and the wiki are always a good starting point. Have a look at this wiki page and this, this and this tutorial.
You always need a message file to generate the C++ files that define the types you need for subscribing and publishing. For instance std_msgs/msg/String.msg is used to generate std_msgs/String.h which is for instance used in the above tutorials. ROS provides a lot of pre-defined messages and if you can, you should use them. If you cannot find a matching message, you need to define it yourself.
