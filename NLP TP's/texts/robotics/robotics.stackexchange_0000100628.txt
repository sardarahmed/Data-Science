Q:

using VISP package for feature tracking in any types of image

hi everyone,
as I checked the VISP pakage (http://wiki.ros.org/visp), in one of its applications, it uses the QR code as a template for feature tracking. Is it possible that instead of QR code, any other image be used? for instance picture of a building??
Thanks

A:

The short answer is yes. You can use basically any picture to do object tracking. QR Codes are 'easier' to detect due to squarish structure/ black and white + they carry information that can be decoded so they can be used for multiple purposes.
If you want to use an image instead, then you can use for example Brute-Force Matching with SIFT Descriptors:
https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dc3/tutorial_py_matcher.html but that's one of many techniques used in Computer Vision.
