Q:

is it possible to use the existing drivers for the hls lfcd lds to communicate with an arduino

I want to bypass all of the turtlebots other components and just use its lidar module to talk with an arduino, I have taken a look on the support page and investigated the drivers, however im unsure as to what items would need to be used to make a usable arduino library for it.

@Darby Lim instead of posting a link, can you please put a self-contained example? That will make this answer self-contained and won't force people to go to another site, look at three different files, and read almost 500 lines of code.
