Q:

Way to clean autocomplete in Vim and .vimrc problem

I've created a thread to solve my problem regarding code completion problem in vim. I planned to clean all vim, omnicompletion, and all the dependencies. I was following a guide for autocompletion purpose. How do I clean all of them? I need to do this because I want to reinstall the stuff hoping the autocompletion problem will solve.
In the process of reinstalling the autocompletion stuff which I use the previous link, I got confused wheather I should put the configuration in ~/.vimrc file (created by myself) or the one which is already available located in /usr/share/vim (named as vimrc).
Hope somebody can guide me on this matter.

A:

Always edit your ~/.vimrc file.  If you mess with /usr/share/vim, you will affect other users on the system.

You have to create the ~/.vimrc file and the ~/.vim directories

My version is 0.41.  All of my configurations are posted on my github account.  You can actually just check it out, if you are interested.  http://github.com/mjcarroll/dotfiles

Following this link "http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1520", your omnicppcomplete  is 0.41, or 0.4 version?

Upon reinstalling, I need to create our own .vim directory and .vimrc file, right? By default, for new installation, I don't see them. I just want to confirm my understanding..
