Q:

Can't Link to liborocos-kdl.so.1.1

I can't run robot_state_publisher, installed on Hydro from debians. I get the following error message.

It appears 1.1 is for Groovy while 1.2 is for Hydro.  I'm currently getting the same problem.  Although both Groovy and Hydro are installed on this computer (shared lab) I know Hydro was sourced during my entire time doing this. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/moveit-users/KS6fCrztt_0

A:

Clean remove and then reinstall. Bah.
