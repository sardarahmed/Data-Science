Q:

REIN Replacement

I have seen previous forum posts saying that REIN is deprecated and that a non ROS version was in development. Has this new version been released yet?

@kwc - What is the current status of the ecto project?  Is it ready for end users to start playing with it or is still in flux?  For example, the build instructions found here (http://ecto.willowgarage.com/releases/amoeba-beta4/README.html) fail on the third step, 'git submodule update', with the error "Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Clone of 'git@github.com:willowgarage/catkin.git' into submodule path 'catkin' failed".

@Pi Robot If you use the https interface it should work: https://github.com/willowgarage/catkin.git
