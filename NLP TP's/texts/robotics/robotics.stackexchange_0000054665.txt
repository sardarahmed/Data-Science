Q:

Final URDF+XACRO result

Hi All,
I have a model in URDF that I'm debugging it contains a few XACRO code and I would like to see the final result once the XACRO code has been evaluated, to be sure that the result is right.
How can I see that?
Cheers,
Germ√°n

A:

I believe this is the same question you are asking:
http://answers.ros.org/question/10401/how-to-convert-xacro-file-to-urdf-file/
Also the answer to your question appears to be in the xacro tutorials page:
