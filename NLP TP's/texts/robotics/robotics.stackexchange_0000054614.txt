Q:

ccny_rgbd Communication with keyframe_mapper_node fails after first service call

I am running ros fuerte and I am running into this issue where the service call to the keyframe_mapper_nodes fails after the first call, as in every call after the first call fails. The first call succeeds. The error that I get for the calls after the first call are
ERROR: Unable to communicate with service [/solve_graph], address [rospc: // localhost:43886]

Sometimes I also get
ERROR: transport error compleing service call: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details

The last two line in the service log says
/use_sim_time is not set, will not subscribe to simulated time [/clock] topic
signal_shutdown [atexit]
atexit

With the exact same setup I have got it all working twice. So it randomly works but I dont know why this is happening. I am using the openni driver packages in ROS.

A:

I think this has got to do something with issue 22 posted on github, which says is fixed.  When there are very low amount of keyframes, if you call the generate_graph call, the keyframe_mapper node crashes. If you move the kinect enough to get a lot of keyframes, then service call goes through fine.
