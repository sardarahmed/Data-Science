Q:

Shadow simulator depends on non-existing libgazebo_ros_factory.so

When starting Gazebo with the command "roslaunch sr_hand gazebo_arm_and_hand_motor.launch" I get this error:

/tmp/buildd/ros-electric-simulator-gazebo-1.4.3/debian/ros-electric-simulator-gazebo/opt/ros/electric/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/build/gazebo/server/controllers/ControllerFactory.cc:99 : Exception: Failed to load libgazebo_ros_factory.so: libgazebo_ros_factory.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The promised log files are not created.
I checked ROS_ROOT/../stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_plugins/lib, and the file libgazebo_ros_factory.so is there in diamondback, but not in electric.

The empty example file included with Gazebo works fine:  roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch

Is it only the Shadow simulator that fails? Can you load other simulations?

A:

Hi, Sorry about the delay in answering this thread.
Electric is not supported yet for the Gazebo simulation of our hardware (see this bug report). I'll try to fix this shortly.
Cheers,
Ugo
