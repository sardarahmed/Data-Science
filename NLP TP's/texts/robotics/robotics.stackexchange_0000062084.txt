Q:

Does the move_base plan a navigation in real time?

Hello !
Now I meet a new question . I had a LIDAR on my real car , and the pointclouds of obstacle were showed around the simulate car on the  blank map . When I give a goal 2D navigation on the blank map , the simulate car and the real car will go to the goal . Now I hope the car can avoid the obstacles when going to the goal . The move_base will give a navigation to the goal , but it does not  plan a new navigation in real time when the car meet new obstacles .
I hope the move_base can plan a navigation in real time .  I am confused about it  !

Another question , I input the PointCloud2 msg which is the obstacles pointcloud to the move_base . Am I right , or should I input the original pointcloud to the move_base ?

A:

If you are talking about the computer science term "real-time" you should check this answer.
If you are talking "real-time" meaning "fast enough", it largely depends on your hardware resources and on the parameters you are using in the planning configuration. If this is the case, you can use a faster computer and relax the planning parameters, check this answer.

the default move_base planner is not designed to avoid dynamic obstacles.
