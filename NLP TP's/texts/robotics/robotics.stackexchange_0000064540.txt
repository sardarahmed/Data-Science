Q:

people tracker - more than one person

Dear Ros Users,
could it be possibile to use the people_tracking_filter of people package in order to track more than one person? How could this be implemented?
Thank you very much for your support

Hi Rahndall,
This package people_tracker says "This node wraps the OpenNI skeleton tracker so communicates directly to the kinect.". So it must be using something similar to the package openni_tracker, with which you can definitely track many users at the same time.
Then people_tracker tracks a specific torso it seems, there must be a way to select one among detected people, depends what you want to do.

Hi Cyril_J,
sorry for the misunderstanding: I was referring to the people_tracking_filter of people package. I edited in the question in the right way. Sorry for this
