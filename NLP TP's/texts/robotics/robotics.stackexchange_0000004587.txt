Q:

Two State Linear Actuator

I need two state linear actuator. You can have a look at the picture to understand what I mean. 
Don't care about the hand !

(source: robaid.com) 
I need to electrically move the things like this squares up and down. Bidirectional linear actuators are needed.
What is the cheapest and tiniest actuator (or sth else) that I can use to move this squares up and down. There are just two states ('up','down'). Don't care how much higher a square rises, when it is up.

A:

What you are looking for is called a solenoid.
