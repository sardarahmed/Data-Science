Q:

How I can run contour_moments.cpp OpenCV example?

I don’t know how to run the file contour_moments.cpp that’s able in this github link: https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/blob/indigo/opencv_apps/src/node/contour_moments.cpp
I’m working with Indigo and I have installed OpenCV3 following this ROS.org link:
http://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv
when i run the command rosrun opencv_apps contour_moments
it only appear a warning and nothing else:
[ WARN] [1450293289.992148166]: Topic 'image' has not been remapped! Typical command-line usage:
    $ rosrun image_rotate image_rotate image:=<image topic> [transport]

which topic should I use?? (I'm using a kinect, and it is working fine)

The required target_link_libraries are listed in the CMakeLists.txt file in the repository.

It might be easier to start with the entire vision_opencv package and progressively remove things from it until it is only building contour_moments.  Don't use OpenCV 3 unless you really need it instead of 2.4, building with it has some issues.

Ok, so I have to uninstall OpenCV3 before installing Opencv2? .. If so, how do I do that?
Comment by lucasw on 2015-12-14:
OpenCV 2 is probably already installed in parallel if you have cv_bridge installed.  If you have OpenCV 3 from debian/ubuntu packages sudo apt-get remove ros-indigo-opencv3

ok, now when i run the command rosrun opencv_apps contour_moments it only appear a warning and nothing else ...

A:

These nodes do not publish any message unless someone is reading that. so try
roslaunch opencv_apps contour_moments.launch image:=image_raw

and
 rostopic echo /contour_moments/moment
