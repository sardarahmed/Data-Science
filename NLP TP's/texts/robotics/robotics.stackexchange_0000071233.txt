Q:

Debian [Wheezy] indigo install libconsole-bridge-dev -std=c++11 error

Dear reader,
While installing indigo on a fresh debian weezy install on the BeagleBone Black.
I came across an error.
In step 2.2.1 from this guide.
While doing the latest command for libconsole-bridge-dev: "sudo checkinstall make install"
I first change the name, as stated in the guide and then when pressing enter I get this.

Installing with make install...

========================= Installation results ===========================
[100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/console_bridge.dir/src/console.cpp.o
cc1plus: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-std=c++11’
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/console_bridge.dir/src/console.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/console_bridge.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

****  Installation failed. Aborting package creation.

Cleaning up...OK

Bye.
Does anyone know what I should do first in order to overcome this error.
More info:

gcc version 4.6.3 (Debian 4.6.3-14)

kernel version: 3.8.13-bone79
Thanks for the help

A:

It turns out that my gcc version 4.6.3 has no support for C++ 11.
Therefore it wouldn't compile.
I updated it to gcc 4.7 with this guide and that fixed my problems.
