Q:

ROS wandering / exploring robot program?

I'm using my bot to assemble a 3d map of it's surroundings using RTABMAP.
Is there another ROS program I can have subscribe to the output of RTABMAP which then autonomously explores unknown areas of the environment until a loop closure or until everything is known?
3d navigation is preferred but I'll take what I can get!
