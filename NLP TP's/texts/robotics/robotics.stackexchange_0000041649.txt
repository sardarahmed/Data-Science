Q:

Visualizing TurtleBot kinect Data error

Hi all,
I recently start to play with Turtlebot, when I try the tutorial of Visulizing TurtleBot Kinect Data, after I type:
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch
there are some errors like this:

.....

then I thought it might be because I recharging my iRobot and I need to restart the
openni_camera nodelet. So I type:
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

but unfortunately get another error like this:
core service [/rosout] found

Anyone has some suggestions to resolve this problem? Thanks.
PS: all the previous turtorials are running ok for my turtlebot and workstation.

Hi all,
Just resolved the problem. It seems the libmysqlclient was missing.
Tried: sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16 and everything is OK now.
