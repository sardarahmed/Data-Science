Q:

Getting sonar and bumper data p2os

Hi, I just wanted to know if there is some example on getting sonar and bumper data from a pioneer3dx using p2os, I can't find anything. I thought it was like getting pose data but now I think it's nothing like that. Can you help me?
It seems like p2os does not offer access to bumper data, but is it possible in any way?
Thanks in advance.

A:

p2os_driver publishes sonar data on the sonar topic.  The data is a special data type p2os_driver::SonarArray whose definition you can see in p2os_driver/msg/SonarArray.msg.  You may need to enable sonar via the ~use_sonar parameter.

Thank you very much, but what about the bumpers?

It doesn't look like p2os_driver provides bumper data, from what I can see.

So what can I do to access to that data?

I went into p2os_driver/src/p2os.cc and changed false in
n_private.param("use_sonar", use_sonar_, false); to true;
however, rostopic echo /sonar still does not produce ranges.  It also doesn't even sound as if the sonar sensors are running.  How can I get the sonar working?
