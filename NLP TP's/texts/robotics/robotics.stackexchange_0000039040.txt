Q:

How to include a ros-unrelated library with target_link_libraries

Hello,
I want use a library called libnpsauv.a in my package. Although I know that I have to use target_link_libraries i don't know how to use it properly.
I tried:
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} npsauv)

But then I got that when rosmaking:
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rospack find rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
[rosbuild] Building package npsauv_simulation
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/roslisp/cmake/roslisp.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/cmake/rospy.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/cmake/roscpp.cmake
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (target_link_libraries):
Cannot specify link libraries for target "npsauv_simulation" which is not
built by this project.
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Note: I copied the library into the lib package folder.

A:

You have to specify the name of the executable which needs your library as target:
 target_link_libraries(my_node npsauv)

(In your case CMake complains because there is no target named ${PROJECT_NAME}.)
