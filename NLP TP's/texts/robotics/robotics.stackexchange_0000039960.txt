Q:

Problem with RVIZ

Hi,
I have two problems related with Rviz:

When I was using with my kinect using this tutorial when I run rviz the window only showed a very small part of the image in the center, it wasn't like is shown in the tutorial, does anybody had the same problem, and know how to solve it?

After, I run this 'rosrun rviz rviz -d table_scene_mug_textured.vcg' and, well first it doesnt show anything on rviz, and well when I tried to launch my kinect again, the configuration of the settings of the rviz changed, and I cant find a way to put it back as it was, to see the images from the kinect. Again, does anybody know how to solve it?

Thanks

Can you post a screenshot of what's going on?

A:

I can only say something to your second question:
The RViz display configurations are saved in a config file called "display_config" located in ~/.rviz/. This file is responsible for how your data are displayed, obviously.
In your case it seems like your display_config has been overwritten. This would mean you could not get back your old settings, unless you created a backup of the previous display_conf.
Maybe if you are lucky you can still find your old display_conf under File -> Recent configs.
If you want to display the camera data from your Kinect you could also manually add a new display to RViz ( In the display panel: Add -> Camera ) and set the topic of desired camera to your Kinect output topic ( In the display panel: Camera -> Image Topic ).
EDIT:
Oh well.... I have no idea why this question was shown to me in my unanswered questions, since it's already a year old...
