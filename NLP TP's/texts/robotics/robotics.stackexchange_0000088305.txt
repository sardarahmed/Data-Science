Q:

$ rostopic list ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!

I am trying to calibrate a Logitic 920 HD 1080p camera in Ubuntu 16.04. I have installed ros kinetik. I am not sure if this tutorial is the correct link but I get this error:
http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/StereoCalibration
mona@Mona:~$ rosdep install camera_calibration

mona@Mona:~$ rostopic list

mona@Mona:~$ 

if the tutorial is the correct one for this camera, how should I fix this error, if the tutorial is wrong, please link me to the correct tutorial.

I think you have missed a step in the tutorial:

Make sure that your stereo camera is publishing left and right images over ROS.

A:

Your error has nothing to do with the camera package. The command you have problems with ('rostopic list') does not depend on your build process or the camera type you are running.
The tutorial assumes that you have worked through the Beginner Level Tutorials in which you can learn how to start a roscore (and the corresponding environment variables).
