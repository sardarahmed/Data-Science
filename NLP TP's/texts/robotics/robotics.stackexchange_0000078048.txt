Q:

Why do we echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup/bash"?

This guide here specifies the command $ echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc to source the setup.bash in the ~/.bashrc. For this reason, the end of my .bashrc has been looking like the code snippet below.
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

Why can't we just add a source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash to the .bashrc instead of the echo?

A:

This command is done one time only:
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
Once it is appended to .bashrc everytime you open a new terminal the bash script /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash is run.
You could edit .bashrc in a number of ways to add the line "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" to the end of the .bashrc file, echo is just a handy way to edit .bashrc.

"could" -> "should".

So a simple source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash would suffice? I was wondering if there was a particular reason as to why the echo was being used.

@sharan100: yes.

I think you misread the installation / setup instructions, as they don't actually tell you to add the echo "source .. line to your .bashrc.

yeah, I would think so!
