A:

Parts of the K-COPMAN system are contained in the prolog_perception package, but I am not sure if this still works under more recent ROS distributions. Similar functionality can be realized by writing an interface to a perception system of your choice (as described in the knowrob_tutorial package). The Prolog predicates in knowrob_perception may be useful for this.
