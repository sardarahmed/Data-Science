Q:

(solved) Slam Generated Map Does Not Appear

A few days ago I succeed mapping on my laptop
Now I trying to mapping as hector slam on raspberry pi3 (ubuntu mate)
By the way mapping not work on raspberry
I think the environment of raspberry is equal the environment of laptop
First my procedure is

Downloading pakage about this project (Hector_Slam, ros_rplidar)

building the files  (catkin make) , setting a port

modifying code of mapping_default.launch of hector_mapping file in hector slam.

I did not modify anything else    

The result of implementation is like this

I changed fixed map : map , laser , base_frame and  and added map on dispaly list (topic : /map)
a error not generate on terminal but also map not appear
what is problem??

For now I cab only be sure that /hecto_mapping is not publishing any topic with a map. But you hided the terminal with the information about the topics..
I think you should write parameters for the map size and resolution also..
