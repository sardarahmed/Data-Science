Q:

kinetic source install on Fedora23

Hey all,
Where trying to install kinetic from source on Fedora23 I have this error :
CMake Warning at /home/malcolm/ros_catkin_ws/source_kinetic/install_isolated/share/python_qt_binding/cmake/shiboken_helper.cmake:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindShiboken2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Shiboken2" with
  any of the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "Shiboken2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Shiboken2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If

  been installed.

Where apparently I miss Shibuken2 and PySide2. I have installed  those packages :
pyside-tools.x86_64                               0.2.13-9.fc23                       @fedora 
python-pyside.x86_64                              1.2.2-4.fc23                        @fedora 
python-pyside-devel.x86_64                        1.2.2-4.fc23                        @fedora 

And during the dependency resolve I only had the gazebo dependy pointed at :
[malcolm@PC124-180 source_kinetic]$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
gazebo_ros: No definition of [libgazebo7-dev] for OS [fedora]
gazebo_plugins: No definition of [libgazebo7-dev] for OS [fedora]

So I guess those missing packages should be added to the list of dependencies ?
Best,

A:

As a partial answer, you need to get PySide through the package manager:
sudo dnf install pyside-tools python-pyside python-pyside-devel python2-pyudev-pyside
See the full list of what I had to install here:
