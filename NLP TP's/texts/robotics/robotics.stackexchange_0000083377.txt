Q:

Position, Velocity and Time

Is there a standard ROS message that can represent an object's x, y position along with its velocity at each position and time passed at the position?

It would be good if you could provide a little more details. Are you looking for something that can report current state, or something that is used to encode desired state?
Comment by Divya Thomas on 2017-10-18:
This is for desired state.  I'm trying to output points along a trajectory where each point represents x, y, desired velocity at that point, and the time to get to the point.

To encode desired state, a trajectory would seem to be the logical choice. That would be what @tfoote suggested. However, perhaps a nav_msgs/Path would be better suited than the trajectory_msgs he links to.

A:

That sounds a lot like a Trajectory specifically the MultiDOFJointTrajectory http://wiki.ros.org/trajectory_msgs
