Q:

Error in turtlebot_simulator at gazebo_ros_create

I'm trying to run the turtlebot_simulator on Ubuntu Precise with Fuerte, which used to work, but now Gazebo crashes with this error:
Service call failed: transport error completing service call: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
In the log spawn_turtlebot_model-4.log I get:
[rospy.internal][WARNING] 2012-06-15 11:53:02,280: Unknown error initiating TCP/IP socket to ivan-MacBookPro:58025 (http://ivan-MacBookPro:39830/): Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospy/impl/tcpros_base.py", line 511, in connect
self.socket.connect((dest_addr, dest_port))
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py", line 224, in meth
return getattr(self._sock,name)(*args)
error: [Errno 111] Connection refused
I commented the Gazebo plugin startup of gazebo_ros_create in turtlebot_description/urdf/turtlebot_body.urdf.macro
!--turtlebot_sim_create/--
and now the robot can spawn.
Any idea of what is happening?
EDIT:
I still have this problem with the latest updates and it also happens on Ubuntu 11.10 and (also) Fuerte.
Obviously commenting out the create plugin for gazebo is not really a solution, since I lose the odometry, etc.

A:

I was having a similar issue and found that I could "resolve" it with the answer to this post:

It does seem, again, like a temporary solution but I think you can get the odometry back in the meanwhile.
