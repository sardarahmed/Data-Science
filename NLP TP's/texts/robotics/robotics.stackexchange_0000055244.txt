Q:

Replacing base ubuntu ros packages with mine compiled from source

Hi,
I'm using ros groovy on armv7l, and I'm getting a bus error from from roscpp_serialization.
The error is well documented (on this forum too) and It seems that there is a patch that fixes it, but it hasn't made it into my ubuntu packages yet.
And I can't find a way to replace this package in my ros build.
If I try to apt-get remove ros-groovy-roscpp-serialization, based on dependencies almost all of ros-groovy-* will be removed.
Is there a way to supersede binary packages with compiled ones ?
Thank you

A:

Ok it seems that using catkin it was as simple as :
cloning the repo of roscpp into catkin/src
and then doing catkin_make
Conveniently catkin seems to export a LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the library compiled in catkin take precedence over the rest of ros.

I just tried and did not experience that: I created a package called map_msgs in catkin/src, with appropriate package.xml and CMakeLists.txt, compiled with catkin_make. it compiled fine, but at the same time my CMakeLists was sort of empty. But when I roscd map_msgs I landed in /opt/ros/...

Did you call $ source /path/to/catkin/devel/setup.bash ?
It should setup catkin as the first thing in you ROS_PACKAGE_PATH env variable.

seems that after a while ros figures that I have a map_msgs package. It's not immediate though. I wonder what's the exact behavior and when is the cache refreshed...
