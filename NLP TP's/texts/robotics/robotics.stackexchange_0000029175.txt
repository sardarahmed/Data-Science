Q:

How to control joints with Foxy and Edifice?

I am assuming there is something similar to the gazebo_ros_control plugin.
Is such a plugin already available? Are there examples?
If not, will a similar paradigm be used in Edifice?

A:

The closest thing to gazebo_ros_control for Ignition/ROS 2 is ign_ros2_control, with its recently opened PR. You can hear more information about it in  Edifice Demos! Ignition Community Meeting (March 2021).
If you need something more simple/custom, you can also use JointController, JointPositionController or JointTrajectoryController (for multiple joints) in combination with ros_ign_bridge (ros2 branch), i.e. publish commands in ROS 2 and subscribe to them in the individual Ignition Joint*Controller plugin(s).
