Q:

Turtlebot follower 410c

Hello,
I'm attempting to run the Turtlebot follower demo on the 410c, with an Xtion 3d sensor.
Debian: build #110
Following these instructions: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot2e/blob/master/Software.md
I've installed ROS Kinetic as described here: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Debian
My TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=asus_xtion_pro
Now I'm trying to run the Turtlebot Follower demo: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_follower
Those instructions say to only run this:
$ roslaunch turtlebot_follower follower.launch
Here is the output I'm getting when I do that:

[ERROR] [1470159262.958298249]: Failed to load nodelet [/camera/driver] of type [openni2_camera/OpenNI2DriverNodelet] even after refreshing the cache: Failed to load library /opt/ros/kinetic/lib//libopenni2_camera_nodelet.so.

A:

I suspect the most likely reason for this error is that the the package is in the workspace but not built.
I have not tested the xtion pro recently on the 410c but would expect it to work. Failure modes I've seen when using SBC computers are typically issues with kernel drivers mounting the device or inadequate data rates for servicing the USB bus causing connection drops which this does not look like.

Thanks for the fast response. When you say "the package" do you mean the libopenni2_camera_nodelet package? And do you have any pointers for how to build that?
I found this link: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/groovy/Source%20Installation
But the equivalent page for kinetic doesn't exist.

(Sorry for the delay - I assumed replying to the notification would be enough to post my comment but it wasn't!)
