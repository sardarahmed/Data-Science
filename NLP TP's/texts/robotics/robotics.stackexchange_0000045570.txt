Q:

rxbag export crashes

Hi,
I'm trying to export data from a bagfile using rxbag. After plotting without problems the data I'm interested on I do right click-> export to csv and after naming the file everything crashes with just a seg fault:
1- Does anybody know why does this happen and how to solve this?
2- Has somebody any C++ code or python using the rosbag API to extract data from a bagfile and save it to a csv to use it as a template?
Any help will be appreciated! :)
I'm on Ubunutu 11.10 and rxbag crashes both in Ros electric and fuerte :S

A:

After some checks, I can contribute that:
1- In another machine with Ubuntu 12.04 Rxbag was exporting without problems
2- In my machine I end up using:
rostopic echo /topic -b=path/to/bagfile.bag -p > output_data.csv

That was much faster to use for my purposes than rxbag.
