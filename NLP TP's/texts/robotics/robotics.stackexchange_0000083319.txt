Q:

starter physical robot base recommendations?

I am looking for graduating from simulator to actual physical hardware with ROS support. Could anyone please recommend popular (and cheaper) options for a base? I want to get a base where I could implement and experiment slam/navstack.
Pioneer P3 DX (USD 4K) and Turtlebot (USD 2K) are on expensive side for individual starter.

I'm not sure, but I feel this is more suitable for some discussion (as there isn't any single answer that is the answer). Perhaps a post on discourse.ros.org would be better?

A:

How about the Trutlebot3 burguer? It is about $600

Thanks, Martin. That is interesting but still on pre-order/nov delivery currently. Wondering if that's the cheapest or are there any other options including DIY.
