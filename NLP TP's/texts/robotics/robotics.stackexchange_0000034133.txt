Q:

rosmake or rosbuild?

Hi All,
I want to develop some ROS packages which contain libraries for other packages to use, and have some questions about the development process:

Should I use rosmake or rosbuild to compile and build my packages?
Which files should I modify to create libraries (.so files) instead of executables?

Thanks,
HZ

A:

From the rosbuild wiki page:
"To build packages, use rosmake."
rosbuild is the name of the library of build-support tools; rosmake is the command you run to actually build stuff. Assuming you're developing your code just for ROS use (as distinct from implementing a ROS wrapper around some library that needn't be / isn't ROS-aware), you should do everything in CMakeLists.txt in your package's root directory. (Everything except setting the exports; that's in manifest.xml).
If you want to compile libraries, use the rosbuild_add_library macro; see the rosbuild wikipage for some examples, and the default CMakeLists.txt that roscreate-pkg gives you.

If you like my answer, accept is (there's a checkbox). That way, more karma for me!

Thanks a lot. It seems I asked a silly question...   type in "rosbuild"  in terminal, and get: "rosbuild: command not found"
