Q:

Powering multicopter with multiple dedicated batteries

I am in the starting phase of building a fairly large octo-copter drone. I am currently thinking about the possibility of powering my octo-copter design using 4 separate batteries where each battery powers 2 motors each, in order to get around the problem of the large current that would pass through the single central line (causing heat and voltage drop etc.) if I where to connect all batteries in parallel. 
For sure there would always be a slight voltage difference between each battery and if you keep flying for too long you are gonna get one battery that runs out before the others, but I am theorizing that it shouldn't really matter as long as I make sure never to completely exhaust any of the batteries. The flight controller should compensate for the lower voltage provided to each engine. That is my theory at least. I saw a video of these guys doing the Hobbyking Beer-lift challenge with a really large drone, and they seemed to be using something that seems to be 4 separate circuits, one for each motor. Has anybody done something similar to this, or have any experiences about if it's a good idea or not?

A:

I agree with lenik first statement, you idea is totally sound.
Also your grounding to not have all the current drained passing through a single 'hub' is sound as otherwise you will need this central hub to be able to handle the total current drained which would result in extra weight.
The two drawbacks of your solutions that I see are as follow:

changing battery pack is going to be more tedious than in the case you could have snapped several battery together 
as your copter is not going to be perfectly balanced and symmetrical, you will have one pair of motors draining its battery faster than the other, this will reduce your flight time
