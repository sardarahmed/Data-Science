Q:

VS code can't find the headerfiles even when workspace compiles without error

Hi,
I've been having this error where the squiggles in vscode don't go away when I try to include headerfiles for custom messages and services. I am able to compile my workspace, I can see the header file for the service created (with response.h and request.h), I can do rossrv show __________ to see the content of my header files as well. It's just that I can't get rid of the red squiggle because of which I can't use autocomplete.
Does anyone know what can I do?
