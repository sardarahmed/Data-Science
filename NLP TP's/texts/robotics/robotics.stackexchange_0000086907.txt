Q:

Installing gmapping on raspbian stretch

Im a trying to run gmapping on multiple turtlebot3's, but since i cannot be the master for more than one turtlebot I want to make them run it by themself. Every guide for installing ros on raspbian is for raspbian jessie. When I try to follow those guides i end up with:
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-slam-gmapping

I have also tried follow the guide "Installing ROS Kinetic on the Raspberry Pi" but when i tried to use
rosinstall_generator

it returned nothing in the terminal, so I am unsure what to do.
On a side note I was wondering if what I am duing is a good idea, is the raspberry pi 3 able to run such a program?

A:

you can try
rosinstall_generator slam_gmapping --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-slam_gmapping-wet.rosinstall

check http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=gmapping  to find the correct name of rep
