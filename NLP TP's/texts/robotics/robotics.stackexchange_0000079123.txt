Q:

UR10 state/real time interface

Hi everyone,
I work on an UR5 with ROS Indigo and the following in my workspace:
universal robot: https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/indigo
modern driver: https://github.com/ThomasTimm/ur_modern_driver.git
Everything works fine (rviz, movement in simulation and on real robot), but can someone tell me how I can get joint position and voltages across the system state and in realtime?
Thank you!
Eva

voltages across the system state

I'm not entirely sure what you mean here, but I'm pretty sure those are currently not published. If they are part of the datastreams on either the secondary or "matlab" interface, then they could be made available, but you'll have to add publishers for them yourself.

Thanks for your fast answer!
What I mean is, that I have connected an analog sensor to the robot and I need the changing voltage (changing distance measurement) of the sensor (like on the UR panel) in ROS. So I can transform the voltage to distance.

Well my answer remains the same: the current driver does not publish the values of the analog inputs, so you'll have to add that. See ur_modern_driver#83 for a related issue, and preferably discuss your plans with the maintainer.

Have you found a solution of your problem? I have the same one...
