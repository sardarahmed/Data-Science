Q:

Multiple subscribers to service

Good evening,
I may have misunderstood the concept of ROS services, but is it possible to have multiple client calling for the same service?
For instance, I have a service running on a server that processes raw images and returns informations about them. Can I have a service that use those informations and another that register the output of server?
If yes, should I create a new node that publish the data, or is it possible to make the service directly speak with the database?
Thank you in advance,
Julien Girard

Yes, this is possible. A service-server offers a service, that any node can use. Each client sends some information to the service and gets a corresponding response. See also here for a simple example.

So, if I understand correctly, you want to send some raw images to the service server and get information about them as a response? Yes, this is possible with a service server.
If your server just processes the images it gets from an external non-ROS source and you want to use them in another ROS node, then it would be better to publish them as a topic.

Thank you very much for your explanation. Considering that I have nodes that uses differently inputs and outputs of this server, I will publish them on a topic.
