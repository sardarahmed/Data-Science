Q:

Line following robot path planning

I have built a mobile robot with several ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and an infrared sensor to track a line as a path. I have written a simple algorithm to follow the line which works fine, but avoiding obstacles are a problem because the robot doesn't know the layout of the path, so even if it does move around the obstacle, it is not guaranteed that it will find the path line again(unless the line is perfectly straight). Therefore, I think I may need to use a path/motion planning algorithm or find a way to store the layout of the path so that robot could predict where to move and get back to the path line and keep on following after overcoming an obstacle. I would like to hear suggestions or types of algorithms I should focus on for this specific problem.
Picture might help specifying the problem I'm facing.

Thank you.

A:

Line following is a simple reactive behaviour. Before you get into planning to solve the obstacle avoidance problem - which can get quite complex - you should consider simpler solutions.
What this simpler solution could be depends a bit on the environment and on your robot. But let me make a suggestion:
while()
    follow line
    if( detect obstacle )
         turn left (leave line)
         while( not detect line )
             keep obstacle within distance d to the right

The devil is in the implementation and sensor setup, but the principle idea is that you track the contours of your obstacle to get you back to your line.
