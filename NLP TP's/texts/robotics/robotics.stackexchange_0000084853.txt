Q:

Question re ACML_demo rosout messages

Hi All,
I am fairly new to ROS, so forgive a rookie question. When I run amcl_demo.launch and view the output, I can see info such as "goal reached" and "got new plan", and I would like to publish these to a rostopic. Trouble is, I can't seem to find which file these info messages are originating from. I checked through the amcl_demo.launch file, the amcl.launch.xlm, etc. but can't find where the info logging is coming from. Any help would be appreciated.

I'm not sure of how much use it is, but those messages are "log messages", and are emitted by move_base itself. Specifically: here.

It might be better / less invasive to subscribe to the action topic(s) that move_base listens to. You should be able to derive goal status from that.

Thanks for the info. I took a look for move_base.cpp, and I can't seem to find it. I found folders move_base_msg, etc. but not move_base.cpp. (I also searched for all .cpp files)  Could it be called something else in my distro? I am run indigo (source installation) with a turtlebot 1 (create, kinect

If you installed things using apt (or apt-get) you will not find the source code on your system. That is expected.
You'll have to build the navigation stack from source to edit it.
But again: I would look at the action server topics to get at this info.

A:

Those messages come through the rosconsole logging system: http://wiki.ros.org/rosconsole
The messages are already published on the rosout topic and can be viewed in rqt_console and other similar tools.
A full overview of the logging system can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Logging

Hi, I can see that they are being published on rosout, but I am interested in having them published to a new topic that I've created as well. I don't want to have to parse all of the information from rosout just to grab these pieces of info.

@g-bot: can you clarify what the problem is with looking at the actionlib Goal, Status and Result topics? Those get you the same info and don't seem to require any modification of move_base code.
