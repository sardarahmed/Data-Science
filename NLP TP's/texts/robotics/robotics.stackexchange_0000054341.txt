Q:

Where is ros-groovy in macports

I'm new to ROS and I am trying to install it in MAC OSX 10.7.5 using ports.
After executing this command
sudo port install ros-groovy
I get the following error:
Error: Port ros-groovy not found
Any idea why. I am following the instructions as specified in here the mac port installation page
Any help appreciated

A:

I think the real problem is that you can't 'sudo port ros-groovy' because there is no port with that exact name- you need to specify the full name, such as ros-groovy-core, etc.
The order of the file URL and rsync is necessary as well, as noted by rleontie.
