A:

Hi,
That message means the physics simulation is required and it is waiting for it to initialize. It can take some time depending on your computer (no more than twice the vehicle models loading time), the message will be displayed each second in any case. You can check if other scenes are running as the default one is the only one that uses that kind of sensors. Try running rosrun uwsim uwsim --configfile shipwreck.xml and see if that scene is correctly running.
