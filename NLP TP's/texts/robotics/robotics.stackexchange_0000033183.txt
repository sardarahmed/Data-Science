Q:

sensor_msg_image.h

Hello,
I'm trying to get image information from Image message and make a image data.
I found that there is some guideline to do this by using open cv.
However, I want to create image class defined by myself, which takes image data like matrix format.
I found that message has uint8_t data. how should I convert to image data to double??
Am I understanding image.h header file correctly?
If not, can you give me some comments?
Thanks

A:

This is a very openCV kinda question, I suggest you look at the very well written documentation given in the wiki http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/index.html. Pay special attention to the Mat data structure.

Okay, so what I am thinking is. convert imageMessage into Iplimage format. Then, I want to convert this Iplimage into Mat format. Then, I want to copy this Mat data using memcpy so that I can construct image. Then, I know width and height, but I don't know what is the type of the data Mat data. How should I know the type of Mat data. is it just uint8_t?
