Q:

PointCloud vs. PointCloud2 for unstructured point clouds

Hi,
I have an application that publishes an unstructured point cloud, which in turn will be used to update a costmap. I remember reading that PointCloud is going to be retired in future a versions in favor of PointCloud2.
However, a cursory look at PointCloud2 seems as though it needs well-defined height & width fields. How can I represent an unstructured point cloud using PointCloud2?
Can I simply set height to 1 and width to N, and expect the library to treat it as a simple vector of (x,y,z) co-ordinates?

A:

Have a look at the PointCloud2 definition including comments.
Your guess is right, you can set height to 1 and width to the number of points in your cloud.
