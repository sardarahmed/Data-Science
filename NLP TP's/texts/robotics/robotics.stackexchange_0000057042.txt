A:

have you tried to update your system recently?  Try this again:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

This should work. There was a problem with rosconsole and ABI compliance at one point.

I use "sudo apt-get -f install" then my rviz run properly.But I don't know what's happen after this command.
