Q:

"Exception AttributeError" on roscore launch

I am receiving an error messages when I run roscore from the command line on Ubuntu 12.04.  Whatever the cause, I was still able to functionally complete the beginner's section of the tutorial page.
I installed ROS (as per the installation instructions), and I set the environment variables for a single-machine network setup.
The following is the output after executing roscore from the command line:
 developer@developer-VirtualBox:~/fuerte_workspace$ roscore
 ... logging to /home/developer/.ros/log/2de0d828-ee47-11e1-a20c-080027500e36/roslaunch-developer-VirtualBox-27454.log

Does anyone know how to resolve this exception?
Thank you.

Don't worry, it's harmless.
