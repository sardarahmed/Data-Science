Q:

How to resolve dependency issues when installing multimaster-fkie on Ubuntu ARM?

Hi all,
I'm trying to install multimaster-fkie with the command
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-multimaster-fkie
I get the following error message
--------@---------:~/catkin_ws$ sudo apt-get remove ros-indigo-multimaster-fkie
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
libqt4-opengl-dev : Depends: libgles2-mesa-dev
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
when I try to run, as suggested, sudo apt-get -f install I get the following error message.
trying to overwrite '/usr/include/GLES2/gl2.h', which is also in package libraspberrypi-dev 1.20150502.d280099-1
Errors were encountered while processing:
/var/cache/apt/archives/libegl1-mesa-dev_10.1.3-0ubuntu0.4_armhf.deb
/var/cache/apt/archives/libgles2-mesa-dev_10.1.3-0ubuntu0.4_armhf.deb
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
So my question is: Do anyone know if it is possible to resolve the dependency issues for libegl1-mesa-dev and libgles2-mesa-dev such that the installation is successful?
Im running a ubuntu 14.04 ARM on a Raspberry PI 2. The image is taken from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RaspberryPi
Thanks in advance :)

Did you ever solve this, I receive the same error on my Raspberry Pi 2 Model B running Ubuntu 14.04?

Same for me too

A:

As the above link is broken, Ill repeat (and facilitate) the solution from http://forums.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=100553&start=200 here. Also just ran into the problem ..
Basically its
sudo apt-get download libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev 
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/libegl1-mesa-dev_10.1.3-0ubuntu0.6_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/libgles2-mesa-dev_10.1.3-0ubuntu0.6_armhf.deb
sudo apt-get install -f

Maybe you need to replace the versions in the middle commands with something different .. tab-autocomplete is your friend ;)

Alternatively, you can specify dpkg to force overwrite through apt-get directly, e.g: sudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" install libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev
