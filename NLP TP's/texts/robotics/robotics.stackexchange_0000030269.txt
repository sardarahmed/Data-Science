Q:

SLAM with the Kinect

To be able to do SLAM using the Kinect sensor do I need to convert the point cloud to something simulating a laser scan?  I notice that there is a package called pointcloud_to_laser.  Are there any examples available showing how to do this?

A:

There's a tutorial that explains how to do laser-based SLAM with a Kinect-equipped Create. It should be easy to adjust the details to your setup.

you could buy a DB25 connector and solder this gyro to it http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9059... connect the rate out to the analog pin and you can run that demo... :)

I have an iRobot Create and to my knowledge, it does not have an IMU.  Consequently, I purchased one of these (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9623) since there is an existing ROS package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/imu_9drazor) to support it.  However, I have not yet tried it as it requires a firmware upgrade to the IMU which I have not yet had time to do.

Just out of curiosity, does the iRobot Create have an IMU ?
