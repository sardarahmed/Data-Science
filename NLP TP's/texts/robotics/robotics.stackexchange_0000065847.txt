Can you cd to the directory of your ros-project (which is located in path/catkin_ws/src/) and try and launch the file from within it. If not to go to the location of the launch file of your project and do:$ roslaunch project.launch

To confirm that your workspace is successfully sourced you can run just "roscd". you should end up in the workspace/devel folder.
To update the list of packages you need to run "rospack profile"
Please refer to this answer for more detail

I am able to cd it, but there is no launch file.
Roscd doesn't show the ws.

A:

I downloaded your workspace. It seems that some things haven't been initialized properly. If I source it and type roscd I end up in pubsub_ws/devel. But I cannot roscd the packages.
Can you run the following ?
cd ~/pubsub_ws
rm -rf build/ devel/ install/ src/CMakeLists.txt
cd src catkin_init_workspace
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
rospack profile
roscd commands
Explaination : When I ran rospack profile I never saw yiur workspace showing in the list. So your packages were never in the $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
To fix it you need to reinitialize your workspace. then rebuild it and update your package list (the list of commands above).Then everything should be working.

I then add my .cpp files in src directory and run catkin_make and then should rosrun be able run.. which is not the case..

you still cannot roscd your workspace ?
can you post the output of all the commands above ?
and output of pwd after running "roscd" alone ?

Can you paste the output of:
"rospack profile"
"echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"
and "roscd" ?
Please
