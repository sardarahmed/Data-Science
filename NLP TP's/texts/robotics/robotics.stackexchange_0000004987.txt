Q:

How do I determine the heading of a six wheeled robot?

I have a robot simulation that simulates Mars Exploration Rover with six steerable wheels.
In case of the following steering configuration
// --- //  front wheels 
//     //  middle wheels 
// --- //  rear wheels

I'd say the heading of the rover with respect of the rover's body is about 45 to the right.
My question is what is the right approach of calculating heading with respect of the rover body? 
Do I simply sum the steering angles of steering actuators and divide it by the total number of the steering actuators? 
Additional Note:
Assuming no slippage on a perfectly flat plane.

A:

Where your robot will go will depend on where the axes of the wheels intersect.

If all the axes are identical, it can turn around any point on the axes, or go straight, perpendicular to the axes.
If all the axes intersect in one point, the robot will travel on a circle around that point.
If the axes are parallel, it will go only straight, perpendicular to the axes. 
If the axes intersect in multiple points it can't go anywhere without sliping.

A:

A vehicle like this that can move in any direction regardless of orientation is called "holonomic".  This decoupling is a little counter-intuitive because we are used to cars, which always move in the direction they are pointing (kinda, see: ackerman steering).  But aircraft and boats deal with this all the time.  The terminology they use is: heading is the direction the craft's nose is pointing, and course is the direction of travel.  
So in your example, I'd say the robot's heading is North (or 0 degrees), and it's course is 45 degrees to the right.
Of course this is assuming there is no wheel slippage.  In which case i don't think there is a formal method because wheel slippage is something people try to avoid.  And since wheel slippage is un-sensed, you need to determine your course with external sensors.
