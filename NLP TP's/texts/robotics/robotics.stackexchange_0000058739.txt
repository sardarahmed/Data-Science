Could you tell us why you are uninstalling OGRE 1.7.4?

@Crystal: Did you have same error that is described on this page ( http://answers.ros.org/question/150801/segmentation-fault-at-rosrun-rviz-rviz/ )? If so, I gave up and reinstalled both ROS and Ubuntu. Sorry!! If you want to ask the question, you should post it again. Question is changed.

oh....more or less the same...sometimes I can use some times not....thank you for your advice! But I have reinstalled both of them 2 times....I think it is the problem of my graphic card driver. I will try some other methods, if they will not work. I think I should reinstall them again...thank you~

A:

OGRE is a 3D graphics library that is used by Rviz; you can't have rviz without it. This is why the package manager installs it when you install rviz.
If you want to use a different version of OGRE, you can build rviz from source.

You should ask this as a new question, and include the command-line arguments you're passing to rviz, and possibly a link to the file you're trying to open.
