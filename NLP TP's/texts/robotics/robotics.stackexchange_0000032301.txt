Q:

Error at rosmake ccny_ground_station --rosdep-install

Hi,
I am trying to install the package ccny_ground_station.
On the command
$rosmake ccny_ground_station --rosdep-install
I get the error as below.

I guess the error is because of missing file asctec_msgs/Height.h. I even found a ticket related the issue. But no solution.

Other than this I get one more error of " undefined reference to `g_thread_init "
I am using cturtle on ubuntu 9.10. I am trying to use the ground station tool for the quadrotor I am building.
Thank you for your help.

A:

I just update ccny_ground_station to the point where it compiles, if you download the latest version (from git) of our other stacks.

I can confirm it compiles successfully on diamond-back. Make sure dependencies have been also cloned, for example the "mav_tools". Then, you could just type: $ rosmake ground_station --rosdep-install
