Q:

How to enable gui in gazebo when the simulation is running?

I am setting the gui flag false when I bring up the robot model using roslaunch in gazebo. My code interacts with the robot model to apply a torque at each joint. After a while, with the code and gazebo simulation still running, I want to turn the gui back on. Is there any way to accomplish this? Please explain. Thanks.
