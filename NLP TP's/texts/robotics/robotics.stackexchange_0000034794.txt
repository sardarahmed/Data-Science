Can someone tell me how to figure out what is wrong? I am quite new to ROS.

I am getting similar results trying to install Electric in 64 bit Natty. Thought it was just my machine configuration. Diamondback install correctly.

A:

Your configuration looks valid to me.
Sometimes the ROS Ubuntu package repository gets into an invalid state while being updated. If so, it should work again fairly soon. Be sure to update the package descriptions when retrying:
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full

I think you are right. the repository were "in a invalid state". Just now I tried  it again and it works now. Great. Thanks.
Comment by Shiqian on 2011-10-08:
I installed Ubuntu 2 days ago. so it is really a clean OS.
Comment by Shiqian on 2011-10-08:
now, i.e., 8 hours later, I still get the same error. Is it possible that in my system some packages are missing?
