Q:

Executable not found in /bin directory

Hi guys,
I am trying to make ROS and the opencv work together for bringing up the edge detection on a quadrotor called the ardrone.
The code compiled successfully and was built using rosmake with 0 failures.
But driver file was to found in the bin which was created.
I am using ROS-electric,ubuntu 10.10
Any suggestion please.
This is my rosmake output:

I have added the cmakelist.txt for further refrence:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.4.6)
include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake)

set(ROS_BUILD_TYPE RelWithDebInfo)

rosbuild_init()

set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)

set(RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)

rosbuild_gensrv()

rosbuild_add_executable(ardrone_kar src/ardrone_kar.cpp)

rosbuild_add_library(ardrone_kar src/ardrone_kar.cpp)

"But driver file was to found in the bin which was created." - this looks like a description of the problem, but it doesn't make any sense to me. Can you clarify?

A:

You appear to have the same target name for the library and the executable.  I believe the 2nd declaration of the target will shadow the previous one.
