Q:

Custom Data Input to RTAB instead of Kinect data

I have a python script which after processing, gives me Depth Map and RGB Input image in realtime. I can not connect kinect directly, but I want RTAB Map to create a map based on the live stream of Depth map and RGB Images processed by Python. How can I do that? I have reasonable experience in Python, but I'm a rookie in ROS.
Does the RTABMap access data via topic/subscribing to some topic? I have little clue, please help me on this.

A:

rtabmap_ros uses topics as input. Topics you need are a RGB image, a registered depth image and camera info of RGB image. See http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/HandHeldMapping for many examples using different cameras. You should be able to do the same with your python script, just make sure you republish the images in different topic names and adjust rgb_topic, depth_topic and camera_info_topic arguments of rtabmap.launch:
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" rgb_topic:="my/python/rgb/image/topic" depth_topic:="my/python/depth/image/topic" camera_info_topic:="my/python/rgb/camera_info/topic"

cheers,
Mathieu
