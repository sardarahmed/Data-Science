Q:

How to add include path in rosmake?

For example:
I installed libvtk-5.8.
And I try to include vtkAppendPolyData.h not vtk-5.8/vtkAppendPolyData.h.
So I want to add an include path to rosmake or ubuntu system.
How to do that?
Thank you~

A:

If by 'add include path to rosmake' you mean you want to add a path to your compiler's include path, just add an include_directories statement to your CMakeLists.txt file:
...
rosbuild_init()
...
include_directories(/path/to/vtk-5.8)
...
rosbuild_add_executable(your_app src/your_app.cpp)
...
target_link_libraries(your_app somelib otherlib)
...

Note though that in general, using absolute paths is not recommended. It seems there is a FindVTK.cmake, so `find_package(VTK ..) would be better.
