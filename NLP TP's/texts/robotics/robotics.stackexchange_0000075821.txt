Q:

Is there a navigation package that works with drones (3d)?

I'm working on autonomous drone flight for a search and rescue concept. I know how to create a 3d costmap but what can I do for 3d navigation? Preferably on Indigo but I'll take what I can get at this point.

Please do not ask questions as an answer to a question. That question also seems unrelated to ROS. If it is ROS-related, please give more details.

@Fixithere I see you're new to this Stack Exchange style Q&A. You accidentally asked a "Question" in the form of an "Answer" to a question I had already asked which was quite confusing to me at first. In order to ask a NEW question you want to click the "ASK YOUR QUESTION" button (top right)
