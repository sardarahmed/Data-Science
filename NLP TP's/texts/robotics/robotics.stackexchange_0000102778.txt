Q:

Question about scan.ranges information

Just to make sure I understand laser scan data.
ranges is an array of scan distances. so:
ranges[0] shows scan distance at angle_min.
ranges[1] shows scan distance at angle_min+angle_increment.
ranges[2] shows scan distance at angle_min+(2*angle_increment)
and so on? Is this correct

@Martin Peris The values in the ranges array are the distances with reference to the sensor frame?

Sorry, I missed your comment. Yes, the values in ranges array are the distances with reference to the sensor frame (specified in the header of the message)
