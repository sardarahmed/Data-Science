Q:

Get list of running nodes

Hi guys,
is there a way to retrieve a list of all running nodes from within a node (rospy preferably)? I've already taken a look at rosgraph.masterapi. It seems appropriate but pretty complex. Is there an easier way than to dismantle the getSystemState call result?
Thanks a lot!
Cheers,
Hendrik

A:

import rosnode
rosnode.get_node_names()

More detail in the rosnode API reference.
