Q:

colcon build fails humble

when i run colcon build, it fails because there is a syntax error. But i deleted the file containing the syntax error, moveMotor.py.  That file used to be in :
~/Documents/my_robot/ros_ws/src/test1/test1

When i run colcon build, it errors because it finds that file in
~/Documents/my_robot/ros_ws/install/test1/lib/python3.10/site-packages/test1/moveMotor.py

When i delete it and run colcon build again, that file is regenerated, and colcon build again fails!
what do i do?
i double checked that my package.xml and setup.py make no reference to moveMotor
