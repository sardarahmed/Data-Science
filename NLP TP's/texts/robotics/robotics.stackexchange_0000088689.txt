A:

At some point the REP 2000 will be updated to define these.
For now I would expect that Crystal will target the same platforms as Bounce since there are no new platforms (not considering non-LTS Ubuntu distros) - see http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#bouncy-bolson-june-2018-june-2019.
The exact minimum versions for dependencies will likely be updated for the rolling platforms like macOS and Windows.
