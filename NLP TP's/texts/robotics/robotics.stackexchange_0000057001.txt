Q:

Typical raw sensor data?

It might be a silly question, but I would like to know for the sake of curiosity. I would like to see real sensor data for 2D case. I can't afford the cost of Laser sensors so far, but I'm sure that there is some recorded real data that allows me to understand and interpret this data. I know that data that is acquired by robot is represented in the robot's frame. For 2D, I should get the range and bearing to an obstacle. I've simulated the procedure in Matlab, but now I want see the real data. Thanks in advance.

A:

You should be able to find a number of bagfiles floating around with recorded laser + odometry. A few examples:

I have posted a number of such bagfiles (mostly from lower-cost lasers like the Neato XV-11 and Hokuyo URG): http://fergy.me/slam
MIT has also posted bagfiles acquired on a PR2: http://projects.csail.mit.edu/stata/downloads.php These include a lot more than just laser data, so they are probably quite large.
