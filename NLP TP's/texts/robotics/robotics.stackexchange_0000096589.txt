Q:

Integrating custom controller to ros_control package

Hi everyone,
I am new to ROS and ros_control and I don't know how to integrate my custom controller into to the ros_control package. I have implemented this tutorial and everything works OK. I can run default/existing controllers but I need to know how I can merge my new controller to the controller_manager.  In my workspace within src folder, I have three folders: rrbot_control, rrbot_description, and rrbot_gazebo and each has its own CMakeLists.txt and package.xml files.
Right now I have a .cpp file of my new controller:

Where should I put it (in which folder)?

Shall I change CMakeLists.txt and package.xml files? and how?

I'm using ROS melodic and ubuntu 18.04.
Thanks a lot for your help.
