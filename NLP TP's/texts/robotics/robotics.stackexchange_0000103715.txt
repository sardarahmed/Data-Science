Q:

Save robot trajectory as a single figure/image

I would like to show the path planned by moveit2 as a figure in a paper I'm writing. I've seen figures with multiple semi-transparent manipulator arms showing various stages of a certain trajectory, (kind of like a flipbook) before. How do I go about generating such an representation of my trajectory?
This is the look I'm going for, though 3D and with a model of a FE Panda arm.
This representation would also be acceptable if its easier to generate.

A:

Can something like this be what you are looking for?

This picture is from MoveIt basic tutorial: https://moveit.picknik.ai/humble/doc/tutorials/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.html
As you can see, you can set Robot Alpha value, as well as trail step size to a value that is acceptable for you. You can also add a "Trajectory" item in RViz
