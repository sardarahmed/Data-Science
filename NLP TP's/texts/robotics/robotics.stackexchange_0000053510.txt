Q:

Does rostopic echo no longer work for arrays?

Recently switched to groovy and rostopic doesn't seem to be able to handle arrays anymore.  Does anyone know why?
Example for me, from a simple topic with a list of doubles:
rostopic echo /robot/joint_states/position[1]
Results in:
Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/opt/ros/groovy/bin/rostopic", line 35, in <module>
    rostopic.rostopicmain()   File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rostopic/__init__.py", line 1666, in rostopicmain
    _rostopic_cmd_echo(argv)   File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rostopic/__init__.py", line 1026, in _rostopic_cmd_echo
    _rostopic_echo(topic, callback_echo, bag_file=options.bag)   File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rostopic/__init__.py", line 692, in _rostopic_echo
    index = submsg_class.__slots__.index(field) ValueError: 'position[1]' is not in list`

Are you sure that that topic is correct? Can you update this question with the results of rostopic info /robot/joint_states ?

A:

It looks like a regression of https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/242
It is fixed in https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/commit/2af3d693645f084086ef0a5c50f9b666ea0fc1fd and will be available with the next ros_comm release (1.9.48).
