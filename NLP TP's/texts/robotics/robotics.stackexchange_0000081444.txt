Q:

ImportError for .cfg file when trying to run a node in ROS Kinetic

I have a .cfg file defined and set as executable in a /config folder which I have added in my CMakeList.txt as well.
In my node's python script, when I try to import the .cfg file to access some of the config parameters in a callback function for dynamic_reconfigure, I get the "No Module Named Pcl.cfg"
I am blank on what could be the problem here. Is there something else I need to specify somewhere? Like in my CMakeList?
I am trying to port some C++ code to Python, so utilizing a CMake for the node which is originally written in C++. So maybe I am missing something, but not sure what.
Would appreciate any guidance! Let me know if you need more information.

A:

The issue was the import statement.
My .cfg file was named Pcl.cfg
And had the following in it -
exit(gen.generate(PACKAGE, "test_package", "Pcl"))
I thought, as per the tutorials, I should import it based on the 3rd argument above.
So my import statement was
from Pcl.cfg import PclConfig
Which was wrong. It was instead supposed to be -
from test_package.cfg import PclConfig
My fault for not thoroughly going through the tutorial on this one.

Thank you for this. The tutorials are super misleading.
