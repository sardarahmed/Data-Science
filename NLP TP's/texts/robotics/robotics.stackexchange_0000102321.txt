Q:

Nav2 DWB Controller Trajectory Critics explanation

Hi!
I don't really understand how the DWB Controller Trajectory Critics work. I understand that they are like settings that define how the robot should follow the path created by the Planner server right?
I see that all of them have a parameter named "scale" which is the weighed scale for that critic plugin. How does this work? I mean, the higher this value is, the more important the critic is for the controller? If so, which is the range of this scale parameter?
Thank you in advance for all your help!

A:

I think this description here has the explanation you are looking for.

###Trajectory Generator Plugins
These plugins generate the set of
possible trajectories that should be
evaluated by the critics. The
trajectory with the best score
determines the output command
velocity.
(...)
###Critic Plugins
These plugins score the trajectories
generated by the trajectory generator.
Multiple plugins can be loaded and the
sum of their scores determines the
chosen command velocity.

Your initial thought seems to be correct - it scales these points from each critic, and at the end it adds everything up and chooses the highest score.

So, as I understand, there is no range for the scale parameter? I can set it to whatever value I want and then, the best trajectory will be the one with the highest score, which it is supposed to match with the highest critic scale set, right?

I understand it the same way you wrote :)
