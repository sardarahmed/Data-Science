Q:

Documentation for URDF2Gazebo parser in gzsdf

The URDF2Gazebo parser used by gzsdf for converting URDFs to SDFs is a great tool, but currently hard to use due to the lack of documentation.
For example, I can add a ray sensor in URDF with the code below:
  <gazebo reference="cliff_sensor_right_link">
    <sensor:ray name="cliff_sensor_right">
      <alwaysActive>true</alwaysActive>
      <rayCount>50</rayCount>
      <rangeCount>1</rangeCount>
      <resRange>1.0</resRange>
      <minAngle>-0.04361</minAngle>
      <maxAngle>0.04361</maxAngle>
      <minRange>0.01</minRange>
      <maxRange>0.15</maxRange>
      <displayRays>true</displayRays>
    </sensor:ray>
  </gazebo>

However, I couldn't find information about how this translates to SDF and what options there are in general  (except checking the files by hand) .
Is there any documentation out there (wiki, API etc.)?
I was only able to locate the source code here on Bitbucket.

A:

There is a tools section on the wiki that needs to be updated with information about gzsdf:
