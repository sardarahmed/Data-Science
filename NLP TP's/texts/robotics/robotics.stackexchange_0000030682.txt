Q:

Overview of classes that are available in a package or nodes

Hi all,
We all know the following line:

ros::Nodehandle n;

what i understand is that "i am instantiating n from a class called NodeHandle that is in a package called ros"
My question is: how do i know / find the classes that are defined in a node or package, without opening every possible file that is available on the ros directory
thanks in advance.

A:

Checkout the Code API documentation in the roscpp package:
http://www.ros.org/doc/api/roscpp/html/
Also the overview gives nice implementation examples:
