Q:

Command-line tool to convert raw laser scan data to bag file data

I would like to convert raw laser scan data to bag file data, preferably, command-line one. Is there as such? By the way, I have tried to simply change the extension of the file straightaway to ".bag" from ".txt", unfortunately, it does not work.

I want to use polar_scan_matcher (http://ros.org/wiki/polar_scan_matcher) that takes an input from a rosbag file. I got the textfile from somebody.

Could you please explain your problem a bit more? Where did you get the .txt file containing laser data? If I'm interpreting this correctly, you want to read from a text file and play that data into a bag file?

A:

At present, I don't believe there is any such utility. The best bet would be to look in the rosbag API. What is the format of the .txt file?

The first 9 fields are fileds like ID, timestamp, roll, pitch, yaw etc and starting 10th field is laser scan value
