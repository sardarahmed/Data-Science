Q:

Error starting .py with roslaunch

Hi,
I am trying to start a python script to allow keyboard control of two dynamixel MX28T servo motors.
But when I try
roslaunch pantilt pt_keyboard.py 

I get the following error message.
"Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 1, column 1"

I thought first I could not run a .py file with roslaunch. But I saw another guy doing it. I already googled for a solution, but haven't found the answer for my specific problem.
Anybody who has an Idea?
Thanks for helping!

A:

roslaunch is supposed to be used with XML launch files. However you attempting to launch a Python script.
To run Python scripts and binary executables use rosrun instead. It also might be necessary to add 'executable' flag to that script with:
$ chmod a+x pt_keyboard.py

Otherwise rosrun will not run the script.
