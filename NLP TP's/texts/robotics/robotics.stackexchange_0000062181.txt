Q:

pointcloud_to_laserscan

I need the package pointcloud_to_laserscan (I can not use depthimage_to_laserscan because I have to specify the min and max height of the points).
I tried to catkinize the package but I couldn't. I tried to reproduce it myself for ROS Hydro but it was impossible.
Has anyone this package (or any other similar version) working on catkin systems?

A:

You can use the package without converting it to catkin using the old rosbuild infrastructure buiding from source.
