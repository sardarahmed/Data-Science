Q:

Wiki Internal Server Error

Hello,
I just created a new page on the wiki:
ros.org/wiki/Robots/AllegroHand
I am getting an internal server error. Could you please restore this page and let me know what I may have done to cause this?
Thank you.

A:

This line was causing problems:
{{attachment:AllegroHandPeace.png||align="right" width="100px"}}

I've corrected it to: (note the added comma)
{attachment:AllegroHandPeace.png||align="right",width="100px"}}
