Q:

base_pose_ground_truth does not correspond with .world from Stage

Hello All,
I have created simple world with some obstacles and added a robot at a given (x1,y1) position. Now when I run stageros I can see the robot at the correct position (according the scale plotted on the Stage GUI). However when I publish the topic /base_pose_ground_truth/pose/pose/position I get the position as x = y1 and y = -x1. Which essentially means the frame if rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. I am confused on why that is happening since both the .world and the topic are part of stage?
Appreciate the help.
Thank you!
