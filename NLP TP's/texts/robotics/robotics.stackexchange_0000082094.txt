Q:

Error in rviz tf2 tutorial

In the tf2 tutorial the following line is incorrect:
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-turtle-tf2 ros-$ROS_DISTRO-turtle-tf2-tools ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf

because ros-lunar-turtle-tf2-tools doesn't exist, but ros-lunar-tf2-tools does. Just a naming error. So it should be:
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-turtle-tf2 ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf2-tools ros-$ROS_DISTRO-tf

A:

That does look like a typo. Can you link to the tutorial you're referring to? There isn't an 'rviz' tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials
