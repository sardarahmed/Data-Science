Q:

Modify ros2 code and build Autoware on that?

Hi, I'm using Autoware.auto on Foxy. I want to modify the source code of ROS2 Foxy or Dashing(not contribution, just for own use) and build Autoware on my modified ROS2 version, is that possible?
As far as I know Autoware.auto is built on ROS image(ade) which cannot be modified, right? If yes, how could it done?

A:

What does the ROS image mean, ade?
You can build Autoware.auto without using ade if you maintain the container image downloaded with ade by yourself.
If your Linux distribution is an apt-based system, such as Ubuntu, you can build Autoware.auto from https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/blob/master You might want to run the scripts in /.gitlab-ci.yml#L58 in order.
I apologize if I'm missing any, as I always use ade.
