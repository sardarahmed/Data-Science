Q:

Problem running gazebo: Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_control.so

I am running gazebo on hydro. I get the following message after the Model is spawned successfully:
Error [Plugin.hh:138] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_control.so: libgazebo_ros_control.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Thanks for your help :)

A:

You might need to install the ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control package (or ros-indigo-... depending on which version of ROS you're using).
