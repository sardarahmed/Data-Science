Q:

Simple question: "Raw uint16 IR image" meaning?

Hi there
my question is very simple, what does it mean: "Raw uint16 IR image" ?
(it's topic's data information: /camera/ir/image_raw)
and what should I put at rgb8 place when subscribing to that topic :
cv_ptr = cv_bridge::toCvCopy(msg, sensor_msgs::image_encodings::rgb8);

Thank you so much.

A:

It would mean that image has only a single unsigned 16-bit value per pixel. The actual meaning of that 16-bit value would be driver specific.
For cv_bridge, you probably want sensor_msgs::image::encodings::TYPE_16UC1 which would be a single channel of 16-bit values.
