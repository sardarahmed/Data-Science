Q:

re_ocject_recorder no point cloud found

Hi,
I am trying to record objects with a kinect using ar_bounding_box and re_object_recorder. I installed them via roboearth stack (with svn up -r2047). I'm using Ubuntu 11.10 with ROS electric.
Here is what I did:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
roslaunch ar_bounding_box ar_kinect.launch 
rosrun re_object_recorder record_gui 

I set the registered_depth param true in device.launch, which is included by openni.launch.
Everything seems to run fine, but the the resulting_pcl topic stays empty.

The only PointCloud2 topic, that's filled, is the /camera/depth_registered/points

But I also can't show this Point Cloud in rviz:
