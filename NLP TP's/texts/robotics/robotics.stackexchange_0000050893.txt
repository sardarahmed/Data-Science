Q:

how can i save my map permanently?

hey everyone ,
hope you are all fine .
After 2 months of working on our turtlebot to build our map using GMapping
we finally today were able to build our map successfully and were able to navigate on it using Autonomous navigation
but we are afraid to turn off our laptops O.o
we are afraid that the map disappear by shutting down the operating system (because it happens every time :( )so is there any way to save the map permanently.
please need help :(

u mean to change the  command from:-
"rosrun map_server map_saver -f /tmp/my_map"
to this one ?

It's the same command, just another filename to save to.
