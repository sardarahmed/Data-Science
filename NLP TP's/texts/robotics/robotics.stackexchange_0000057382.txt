Q:

Errors compiling Rosjava code

I am having a compiler issue while running rosjava.  I am attempting to compile a piece of java code using javac along with adding org.apache.commons.logging third party Java library to my classpath, but I am receiving the following messages:
"package org.ros.namespace does not exist"
"package org.ros.node does not exist"
"package org.ros.node.topic does not exist"
Would you know by any chance what could be causing this issue or if I am even compiling the java code correctly?  The code is in the "robot" subdirectory within my "rosjava" directory in a third subdirectory called "src".  I am currently running on the Hydro distribution of Java.

What instructions are you following to build?

I'm using instructions from: http://pharos.ece.utexas.edu/wiki/index.php/How_to_use_ROSJava_to_Program_the_iRobot_Create_to_Move

A:

Looks like your internal documentation was for fuerte. Consequently the rosjava wiki page instructions will be out of sync with your internal wiki instructions (ros went through big build system changes from fuerte -> hydro). RosJava also moved from google code to github.

OK. Are there updated instructions on how to compile and run this sort of code, or would I have to revert back to fuerte on my machine? I have a fuerte distribution from a previous download.
