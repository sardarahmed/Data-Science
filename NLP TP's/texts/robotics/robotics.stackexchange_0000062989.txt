Q:

ROS packages for beaglebone black

Hi,
I was trying to run ROS on multiple machines as described in this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
One of the machines is my ROS Hydro VM while the other is a beaglebone black with beagle-ros installed. However the beagle doesnt have the necessary packages installed like rospy_tutorials or turtlesim.
How do I install these packages so that I can experiment with ROS' distributed computing features?

A:

There are a bunch of packages available for BeagleBone Black. See the UbuntuARM installation page: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM
You can always install from source for anything that is not available from binary packages: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source
