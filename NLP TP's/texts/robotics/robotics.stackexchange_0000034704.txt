Q:

Invalid image from android_tutorial_camera?

I believe I have the latest code for rosjava and the android rosjava.  But my ubuntu laptop will not display an image from the /camera/image_raw topic.  I even tried changing the topic to /camera/image_raw/compressed.  I have tried various ways of invoking image_view on the laptop but it always displays a blank window.  I know the phone is sending images because I can view then using the android_image_transport app on another phone when all of them are tied to the same ubuntu ros master.  I cannot rosbag the image topics from the android_tutorial_camera app either.  The bag is empty/corrupted.  Help please?

Copying from the comment:
Looking at the terminal running roscore, I saw I was victim of using my workstations hostname instead of its IP. Similar to another post in answers.ros.org, I did an "export ROS_IP='192.168.1.2'" in both terminals -- the one running roscore AND the one with image_view
