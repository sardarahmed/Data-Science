Q:

Check collision between robot and environment in OpenRAVE

I have a robot arm in an environment. How can I check for collision between this robot arm and the environment?

A:

It's really easy.
env = openravepy.Environment()
env.StopSimulation()
env.Load('_ArmFileName'_.xml') #Whatever .xml file you're using
robot = env.GetRobots()[0]
manip = robot.SetActiveManipulator('left_arm') #whatever arm you're using
robot.SetDOFValues(joint_values, manip.GetArmIndices())
env.CheckCollision(robot)

where joint_values is the an array of the joint values that you want. For example, if I was working on the Baxter robot, then I'd make an array of length 7 (7 DOF arm) with each value being values within Baxter's min/max joint values. Also note that you need to specify in the xml that your robot has the appropriate arm.
