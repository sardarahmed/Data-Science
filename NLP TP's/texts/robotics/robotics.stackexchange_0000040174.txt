Q:

Do Fuerte packages using Eigen need to depend on common_rosdeps?

I'm a bit confused about this. The Eigen wiki page indicates that, for Fuerte, a package's manifest.xml needs to have
  <depend package="common_rosdeps" />
  <rosdep name="eigen" />

.. but the common_rosdeps wiki page says that this "stack/package" (which is it?) is "deprecated" and "no longer necessary".
I've tried commenting out both lines above and my code still seems to build happily so maybe this only matters in a rosinstall situation (which I tend not to do). But at any rate the information on the Eigen wiki page is still a bit confusing since it recommends depending on a deprecated package.

A:

Eigen is now an external library so if you use Eigen, make sure your CMakeLists.txt has:
find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)
include_directories(${Eigen_INCLUDE_DIRS})

so your code will compile. You don't need to add common_rosdeps anymore for Fuerte, you are correct, it is depreciated.

Thanks. I tweaked the Eigen wiki page to hopefully make it clearer.
