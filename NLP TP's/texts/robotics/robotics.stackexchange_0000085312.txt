Q:

Cannot run fetch gazebo simulator in Indigo

It has been almost 4~5 hours now for the error below:
I have installed ros-indigo (from source) on my ubuntu 16.04
Now I am trying to run fetch gazebo simulator by running: "roslaunch fetch_gazebo simulation.launch"
But, I cannot avoid the error msg below.
Can anyone help me ?

Just out of curiosity: why did you install Indigo from source on 16.04?
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-14:
Indigo doesn't support ubuntu 16.04 if I am not mistaken...
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-14:
That is true. But the question was more: what made you install Indigo in the first place?
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-14:
Fetch recommends ubuntu 14.04 and ros indigo
Unfortunately,  my linux box has 16.04. And I do not want to go back to 14.04
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-14:
Looks like work is underway to get things released on Kinetic: fetchrobotics/fetch_gazebo#15. According to the last few commits it should already work.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-14:
As to your problem: do you have the fetch_description package in your workspace?
If you want to continue with your Indigo installation, I'd suggest creating an overlay workspace that extends your Indigo underlay. Then use regular catkin_make (or catkin build) again.
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-14:
According to their manual, I am supposed to install Indigo ( http://docs.fetchrobotics.com/gazebo.html#installation )
I didn't know fetch_gazebo is updated for ros-kinect.
Let me try your suggestion. Then, I will get back to you.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-14:
If at all possibe, I'd try to get the packages to work under Kinetic. Using a source install of Indigo under Xenial is a bit convoluted.
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-14:
You are right. But, the problem is the actual fetch robot in my lab is equipped with ros-indigo. :(
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-14:
As long as the messages (and services, and actions) that you use between the two haven't changed, that should not be a problem.
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-14:
I don't think I can install fetch-gazebo-demo from sudo apt-get, do I?
How do you install fetch-gazebo-demo source into /opt/ros/kinect ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-14:
No, not on Kinetic no. None of those pkgs have been released.

How do you install fetch-gazebo-demo source into /opt/ros/kinect ?

I would not do that.
Just create a Catkin workspace, clone the pkgs and build them (using regular catkin_make).
Make sure to follow the issue I linked earlier.
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-14:
Man... What should I do with the source compiled indigo... Can I just remove the folder?
Any possibility of interfering pkg installed kinetic?
Thanks for your help anyway.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-15:
So you've got the packages compiled and working in a Kinetic workspace?

What should I do with the source compiled indigo... Can I just remove the folder?

if you don't have any use for it, then I would say, remove it.
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-15:
OK Thanks.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-15:
So do you have things working?
Comment by thezest on 2018-02-16:
In my laptop I can launch Fetch Simulator. I can see all the topics.
But, I have another problem related to rviz now :(
Your advice helped me a lot though. :)

A:

Op had a source install of Indigo on Ubuntu Xenial that appeared to be missing (at least) the fetch_description package, which caused the problem.
Based on the work done in fetchrobotics/fetch_gazebo#15, it appeared that installing the Fetch packages on Kinetic is now actually possible, so OP opted for that.
