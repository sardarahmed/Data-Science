Q:

Catkin_make error when downloading Baxter SDK

Currently following this tutorial (http://wiki.lofarolabs.com/index.php/Baxter_Research_sdk_installation) to download Baxter SDK, when I reach the catkin_make section, i get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Im using ubuntu 20.04, ROS Noetic.
Not sure how to fix it, please help.
Many thanks

A:

ROS Noetic changed to python 3 as the default version of python.
That error looks like the code that you're running is expecting python 2 style exceptions.
Looking at the tutorial it was written in 2015 for Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04. at which time python 2 was the default.
To use software that old on a newer platform and version of ROS you will need to do a bunch of code migrations to upgrade the compatibility.
