Q:

How can I have access to values in the octomap datasets

I want to have access to hitting points, colors and pose coordinate values in the octomap datasets (e.g. to use octomap datasets in MATLAB). The datasets I am talking about are available in this link . The dataset are in the form of .ot, .bt and .graph files. It says that .graph files contain raw sensor readings at registered poses in a binary format. You can convert them to .bt and .ot (the final occupancy map format).
How can I have access to the point and color information? I mean to have them (hitting points, colors and pose coordinate) in the from of a text file or something like that.

A:

The end points and scans with poses are stored in a format proprietary for OctoMap. The OctoMap tool "graph2tree" can read them, so your best starting point would be to have a look at the file graph2tree, specifically ScanGraph::readBinary(...).
However, there is no color information stored in them.
