Q:

Most recent transform in tf Tree

Hi all,
I want to ask that why the value of Most recent transform in my transformation tree so high? Does it mean that there is too much latency in generating the transformations? My tf tree:

Thanks in advance.

A:

IIRC, those values are actually stamps in Unix time, so "time in seconds since Thursday, 1 January 1970". You can convert those timestamps pretty easily (this site can do it).
For instance, for map -> odom_combined, the last transform is dated 2015-05-01T18:29:40+00:00 (link).
The time 'between' two transforms (if that even makes sense) would be calculated by subtracting their respective timestamps.
