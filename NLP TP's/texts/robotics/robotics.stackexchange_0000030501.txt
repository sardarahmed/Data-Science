Q:

Why do I see negative average delay in tf_monitor?

It seems to be only when I run simulation.

A:

Negative average delay comes from the transform being timestamped in the future when sent or by network delays when running in simulation.
In simulation time is sent over the /clock topic and may arrive after transforms sent from a different node with the same time.
A few nodes stamp data in the future, most noteably AMCL. This is valid for AMCL and other similar nodes publishing a small correction transform which is expected to remain approximately static and never have inherent velocity. The value is that AMCL can update at a slow rate but does not prevent transforms through it's correction to be used at a high rate.
