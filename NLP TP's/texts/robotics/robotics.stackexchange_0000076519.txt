Q:

Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial: Arm64 and Kinetic

A the moment of writing supported architectures for ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) are:

amd64
i386
armhf

Debian supports amd64 and arm64
I'm trying to get a full installation of ROS working on my NVidia TX1 which runs Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) on a arm64 architecture.
I was wondering if there are plans to support arm64 for Xenial in the near future?
I found that the repository already exists: http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/xenial/main/binary-arm64/
however, it does not contain ros-specific packages yet.
This is what i tried to get ROS working:

Adding the Debian repository (Jessie arm64) to my sources -> Cannot install ros-kinetic packages because of invalid dependencies

Compilation from source -> Unable to install all packages. Some of them work, some do not (rviz, rqt).

A:

The ROS Kinetic doesn't have a installation guide for Ubuntu ARM, but ROS Jade does. So you can refer to Ubuntu ARM install of ROS Jade, follow the steps and replace jade with kinetic.
The basic steps are:

Setup repositories, locale, sources.list and apt-key.
Install ros-kinetic-ros-base
Install individual packages that you need.

Thanks! As of 2016-10-04 i can see the repository now hosts packages for arm64 as well. So installation should be possible according the guide.

@marting Can you give an update if you manage to complete the installation. I was looking into upgrading my TX1 to L4T 24.2.

Installation was successful (desktup-full). You might run in to trouble with sudo rosdep init. It fails because of an invalid SSL certificate. I've got it working by calling sudo c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs. See https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/12894 for more info.

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
In this statement, should trusty be replaced by xenial ? if I'm using Ubuntu 16.04?
