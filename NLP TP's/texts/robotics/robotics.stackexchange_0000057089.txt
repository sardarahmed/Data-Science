Q:

Turtlebot bringup sci not available

Hi,
Tried three different computers, two different USB-2-Serial cables, but it never works. There is output on the screen, then a warning, followed by the iRobot Create being turned off with a single beep. Using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, with a Kinect on top of the iRobot Create.
[WARN] [WallTime: 1391659582.260008] Create : robot not connected yet, sci not available
The irobot_create_2_1 bumpGo.py demo DOES however work, on the same system and hardware.
Full screen output here at gist.github.com / Alex-van-der-Peet / 8838247 (had to break it up, not allowed to post links). We set the environment variables specific to our robot:
export TURTLEBOT_BASE=create
export TURTLEBOT_STACKS=circles
export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=kinect
Thanks,
Alex
