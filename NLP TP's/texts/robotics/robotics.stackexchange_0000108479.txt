Q:

how to get node graph like rqt_graph with command line?

my ros2 env does not have a display or visualization config, is there a method only by cli to get the node graph? (e.g. save in *.png)

A:

I was looking into this recently and came across https://github.com/kiwicampus/ros2_graph. This allows you to generate a ROS graph in Mermaid (a markdown language) on the CLI which can then be converted to an image either on another machine or on the CLI and then scp'd to another machine. Hope this helps.
