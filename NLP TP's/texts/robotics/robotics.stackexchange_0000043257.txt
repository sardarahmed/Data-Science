Q:

What is my rosjava setup missing?

I have been working through the Pharos Lab's rosjava tutorial, which is located here
Here is my build.gradle file contents:
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'application'
mainClassName = 'edu.ycp.RobotMover'
sourceCompatibility = 1.6
targetCompatibility = 1.6
version = '0.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
group = 'ros.my_stack'

When I run gradle installApp, I don't get any errors. However, if I try to run my application from the command line with:
./build/install/robot_mover_java/bin/robot_mover_java edu.ycp.RobotMover

I get a NoClassDefFoundError.
Did I forget a step in the process? Does the build.gradle file need something else? I am calling robot_mover_java from within the ROS package that I created.
Thanks!

A:

That tutorial appears to be rather out of date. I suggest you start with the tutorials in the rosjava documentation.
