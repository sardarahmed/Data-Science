Q:

Using stageros and a simulated camera

Not sure how long this has been in the "stack" but does the existence of pantilt.inc and the ModelCamera definition in stage.hh mean that there is now hope for subscribing to camera images in stage?
If so, should this be some sort of plugin ala gazebo, or a new addition to stageros.cpp?
