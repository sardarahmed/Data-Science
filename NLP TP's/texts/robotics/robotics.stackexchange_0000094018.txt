Q:

Is it possible to post a helpful tutorial onto ROS website

I have accomplished a few important things in my project that I would like to contribute to the ROS community in the form of a tutorial.
The project is regarding MATLAB visual studio on windows communication with ros on ubuntu over the network.
Is it possible? and if so how do i go about doing so?

+1 thanks for your interest! The ROS Wiki is a good place to start!

But how do i publish a tutorial?

A:

You need to set up an account on the ROS wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/action/newaccount/Documentation?action=newaccount
Once you have an account, you can post on this issue to request edit access to the wiki: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/roswiki/issues/258 (we've had a lot of spam, and this helps prevent bots from taking over the wiki)
Then you can create new wiki pages or update an existing tutorial.
