Q:

roscore fails at the start : error while loading shared libraries: libboost_thread.so.1.71.0: cannot open shared object file

Does anyone have any idea why the roscore fails at the start because of a strange library error? This never happened to me and it is a very strange error:
emanuele@emanuele-pc:~/catkin_ws$ roscore

Thanks for shedding light on what is happening here.

What OS and version are you using?
What version of libboost is installed?

A:

Thanks problem is solved: I have Noetic installed on Ubuntu 20.04 and installed boost libraries from source. I uninstalled ROS and ALL instances of boost via sudo apt autopurge $(dpkg -l | grep boost | grep 1.71 | awk '{print $2}'). Re-installed ROS Noetic only (as it comes with the proper version of boost 1.71).  Now the roscore starts with no problem. However catkin_make keeps failing because of the following error error: ‘boost::placeholders’ has not been declared

Now the big problem is that, despite Noetic comes with the proper version of boost 1.71 (I checked this with dpkg -s libboost-dev | grep 'Version' right after installing Noetic; to double check I also did ldconfig -p | grep libboost) my previous post is my biggest concern as I am currently unable to run any project.

It can get complicated if more than one version of libboost is installed. For a ros project, it's least confusing to just use the same version that ros itself is built with.

I'm glad you figured it out.
