A:

Did you source rosjava_build_tools before running that?
If you followed the instructions to install rosjava from source (http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/kinetic/Source%20Installation), you need to source the workspace:
source ~/rosjava/devel/setup.bash

Only after doing that you can start using those command line tools.
