Q:

How to generate a mesh file for URDF

Pybullet needs a mesh file to go along with URDF. Is there a non painful way how to generate one?
Ideally I'd love to generate one from the URDF file itself, as it has all the boxed already defined there. Less ideally, I could use a hint on how to make these mesh files without learning blender or unity or other monstrous tools.

A:

The URDF file simply references DAE/COLLADA files that exist elsewhere on the filesystem. Blender and FreeCAD have exporters for DAE files. Saying Blender is a "monstrous tool" is an opinion that probably has little facts to back it up. If you plan on doing URDF file generation more in the future, you will need to learn Blender. DAE is the default exporter for Blender and my experience with it has shown that it works well. There is a Stackexchange page for Blender as well. There are also great youtube channels that show how to use blender. Your best bet is to learn Blender though.
