Q:

Rgbdslam how to build

I'm very new to ros and have been trying to rosmake rgbdslam. I added the two svn sources from the wiki and am not sure how to add them into ros so that it will build. Is there something implied in the wiki that needs to be done to add rgbdslam to rosmake. Is rosinstall used to make proper setup? Please help, thanks

A:

Have you added the two directories you downloaded to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in your .bashrc file? (i.e. if you have both directories in folder ~/rgbd, then add ~/rgbd). If you don't know how to do this, add this line to your .bashrc file:

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=DIR:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

Replace "DIR" with the directory your folders are located at, i.e. ~/rgbd.
If you've correctly done so, running the command "rosmake rgbdslam" should build the entire solution for you. If you haven't done so, you'll likely get some error that says rosmake cannot find package rgbdslam.
