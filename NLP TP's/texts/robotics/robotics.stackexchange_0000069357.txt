Q:

What does rosdep init do?

Hi, I was wondering what does the following command exactly do and why do we need it?
pi@tenzo ~ $ sudo rosdep init
Wrote /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list

Why do we need to run the update command afterwards?

A:

The source of rosdep key entries are maintained on rosdistro repository and frequently updated.

Why do we need to run the update command afterwards?

After rosdep update you probably saw something was done at ~/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache. That's where the latest rosdep key entries are stored in some files that get updated with the rosdep command.
