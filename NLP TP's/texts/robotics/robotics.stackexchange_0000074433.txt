Q:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt (rosbuild_init): Unknown CMake command "rosbuild_init"

Hello,
I faced this error, while trying to operate cmake .. -DROS_BUILD_TYPE=Release in the build folder of ROS Path.
Does anyone know how to solve it ? Here is the my ROS Path in .bashrc file:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:/home/ramtin/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2

And here is the Error :
ramtin@ramtin:~/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2$ mkdir build
ramtin@ramtin:~/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2$ cd build
ramtin@ramtin:~/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2/build$ cmake .. -DROS_BUILD_TYPE=Release

A:

When you're using rosbuild you do not directly invoke cmake. Please see the documentation at http://wiki.ros.org/rosbuild
As linked at the top you build using rosmake
There's a tutorial for building a package Click on the rosbuild toggle to get the rosbuild version.
If you're not familiar with ROS I'd suggest at least reading through the core tutorials.
