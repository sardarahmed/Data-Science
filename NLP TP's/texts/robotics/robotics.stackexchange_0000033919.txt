Q:

Why CMakeLists's rosbuild_add_executable couldn't have a name 'test'?

My package couldn't generate executable file when CMakeLists has a line:
  rosbuild_add_executable(test src/t.cpp)

My package can generate executable file when CMakeLists has a line:
  rosbuild_add_executable(test2 src/t.cpp)

I found that only the name 'test',it failed to generate an executable file.
What happened? I use ROS diamondback.
Thank you~

A:

From the rosbuild/ CMakeLists wiki page:

Do not call your executable test. This target name is reserved for unit testing, and CMake will fail if you try it

The page describes a workaround if you really need to call it test
