Q:

can i control the speed of ros running?

Can I control the speed of ros running on my PC? I have ros hydro installed on ubuntu 12.04 LTS. For some reason, I wish to change the speed of ros running on my system (say i wish to speed up or speed down the code-running at the back end of my ros package, i.e; controlling the ros running speed). Is that possible?
A solution without modification of package code is highly desirable.

A:

What speed exactly do your what to reduce?
If you want to reduce the rate at which a message callback is being called, you can use topic_tools throttle:
http://wiki.ros.org/topic_tools/throttle
If you want to adjust an internal loop you can embed a ros::Rate, call .sleep() on it like in the tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber(c%2B%2B)#roscpp_tutorials.2BAC8-Tutorials.2BAC8-WritingPublisherSubscriber.Writing_the_Publisher_Node) and use a ros parameter to set the loop rate in your node from the param server without having to change your code....
