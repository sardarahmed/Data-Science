Q:

Error while connecting to Roomba using roomba_500 package

As soon as I run -->
rosrun roomba_500_series roomba560_node

it gets connected for a fraction of second and then displays the error message
Error: Could not retrieve sensor packets while connecting roomba with laptop. 

Any setting that needs to be done for persistent connection ? Please suggest.

I have installed ROS fuerte and checked... It's giving same error --> Couldn't retrieve sensor packets. Please suggest what should be done in case we face with this error on ROS fuerte / electric. I have checked everything again like USB permissions etc.

A:

There was issue with roomba 521 base's FTDI serial connection due to which it was getting disconnected as soon as it gets connected to roomba. I have tested on two other turtlebots that we  have got in lab and everything working fine. Thanks for the help. Can you please accept this and close this as well as other questions that i raised. @arkapravo
