A:

This indicates some other process is currently (potentially) modifying your packages. You first have to end that process so your "apt-get" process is allowed to take the lock and install packages. A typical example of this happens if you have "sudo synaptic" or the package updater running and try to install packages using "apt-get" at the same time.
