Q:

Does ROS navigation stack need wheel encoder?

I have a mobile robot without wheel encoder. I have a 2D laser range finder. I want to run ROS navigation on this robot.
I notice that amcl can provide tf between /map and /odom. Because I have no wheel encoder, so that no /odom to /base_link tf can be provided.
Does ROS navigation stack need wheel encoder? How can I run the navigation stack on this robot?
