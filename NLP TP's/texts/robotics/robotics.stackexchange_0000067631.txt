Q:

What is the difference between the gazebo differential drive plugin and a differential drive controller spawned by controller_spawner?

What's the difference between

a controller specified by 
in a  tag, in an URDF file, and

a controller spawned by a controller_manager spawner node of type "diff_drive_controller/DiffDriveController"
?

This is a Gazebo plugin, and hence will work only in Gazebo (doc).

a controller spawned by a controller_manager spawner node of type "diff_drive_controller/DiffDriveController"

This is a ros_control plugin, and will work with any supported robot backend, and includes not only Gazebo, but ros_control-enabled hardware, and potentially other simulators as well (doc).
Feature-wise they seem roughly similar: take twist commands, publish odometry. I would suggest you to look at the documentation of each alternative and figure out which works best for your setup.

It seems that now these two behaves quite differently by default. On my current setup (ros-kinetic-desktop-full with Gazebo7), the gazebo plugin works well with joint defined with EffortJointInterface. But the ros_control plugin seems to be requiring VelocityJointInterface.
