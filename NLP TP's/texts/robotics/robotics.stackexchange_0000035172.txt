Q:

rviz to create png/jpeg maps of the environment

Can I use rviz (with stage/gazebo) to obtain progressively better maps with time ? Can I get that map in png/jpeg format ?
May be a noobish question - any help is appreciated.

What kind of map? rviz is only a visualization tool.

A:

The short answer is "no", but the longer answer is "yes".
rviz is just a visualization tool; it just lets you watch what's happening. If you want to generate maps, you want the slam_gmapping stack (in particular, the gmapping package), which is the standard way to do (2D, laser-rangefinder) SLAM in ROS. There's nothing special about stage or gazebo; as far as GMapping is concerned, their data is just as good as the data from a real robot.

@Mac : Hi again, just wanted to ask you - using gmapping and mapserver with gazebo - does that give a pgm SLAM map ? I am trying to work out SLAM with gazebo - not really much has worked out ! :-(

@Mac : Thanks, never tried it, not really great with gazebo .....
Comment by Mac on 2011-11-10:
Certainly. Why wouldn't it be?
Comment by Arkapravo on 2011-11-09:
@Mac : Is  it possible to make such SLAM maps using gazebo ?

That tutorial might be worth putting in a more-visible place; maybe on the stage or gmapping wiki pages? I'm not sure what the right place is.

@Mac : Working pretty nicely, I have put together a tutorial of sorts ! .... http://mobotica.blogspot.com/2011/10/maps-from-stage-simulations-in-ros.html

You're welcome; go ahead and accept my answer, too (the checkmark icon).

@Mac : I have started getting some results using the map server - accuracy is not the strong point right now - but stage marries well with gmapping and map server. Thank you once again.
Comment by Mac on 2011-10-25:
I don't, I'm afraid. Still, this is a standard use case, and should be well-supported.
Comment by Arkapravo on 2011-10-25:
@Mac : Thank you - do you have any examples of such (viz. stage + gmapping) ?
Comment by Mac on 2011-10-25:
It certainly can.
Comment by Arkapravo on 2011-10-25:
@Mac : Can stage/stageros function in tandem with gmapping ? Simulation in stageros and map of the same in gmapping ?
