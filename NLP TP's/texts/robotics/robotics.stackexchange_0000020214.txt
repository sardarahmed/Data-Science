Q:

Can workspace of a manipulator change after considering its dynamics?

As per my knowledge, the workspace of a manipulator can be determined if one knows the forward and inverse kinematics. But is it possible that the workspace of the manipulator can change after considering the effects of dynamics?
In other words, can I determine the workspace of a manipulator only from its kinematic model? Or do I need to consider the dynamic model as well?

A:

The workspace of a manipulator is strictly determined by its kinematics.  Since kinematics only consider the geometry of motion, without regard to forces and torques needed to accomplish tasks, you need the dynamics (and controls) to determine what motion profiles are achievable within the workspace.  But those dynamics do nothing to determine the workspace itself.
