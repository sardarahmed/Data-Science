Q:

Arduino or Raspberry Pi?

I want to make a object tracking quadcopter for a project. While I'm using the Arduino Mega 2560 as the flight controller, I was thinking of using an additional offboard microcontroller/board for getting data from the onboard camera,which would then send an appropriate command to the onboard Arduino.
I was hoping someone could provide clarification on the advantages/disadvantages of doing object tracking with either choice.
Thanks!   

A:

For interfacing with a camera, I would recommend the Pi. The reason is that the AVR in the Arduino is an ordinary processor, whereas the Broadcom SoC in the Pi was originally designed for multimedia. Besides the ARM processor, it contains video encoding/decoding hardware that you won't find in the Arduino.
Of course, you would need to learn how to use that extra hardware.

A:

The only issue with having the off-board controller is that the commands to the quad-rotor might lag, because of 1. range to controller or 2. the complexity of image processing code. With that said I wouldn't say use an Arduino only, because it probably won't be fast enough to do image processing + stabilization from accelerometers and gyroscopes. Instead use a raspberry pi and arduino in tandem, maybe the arduino is connected via serial. That way the arduino can do normal flight stabilization, and the raspberry pi can do image processing and send maneuvers to the arduino for appropriate action to the quad-rotor.
