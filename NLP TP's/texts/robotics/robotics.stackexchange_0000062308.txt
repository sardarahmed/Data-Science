Q:

About local planner?

Hi all,
I'd like to implement a new local planner in move_base.
My new planner is based on a Fuzzy-PID controller and is implemented in c++.
My question is: can I integrate it in the ROS's navigation stack? and how match is it difficult or easy to do?
waiting for your answers and your help.
Best regards.

A:

To integrate a custom local planner with the navigation stack is fairly easy: You need to write a plugin for move_base that adheres to the nav_core::BaseLocalPlanner interface.
You can find documentation here and as an example you can take a look at the code of the dwa_local_planner (pay special attention to dwa_planner_ros.h and dwa_planner_ros.cpp)
