Q:

ROS3D.Viewer not appearing

With our custom package, I used to be able to show ROS3D.Viewer object on Chrome last year but now I can't. So what can cause ROS3D.Viewer to not appear in general?
Sorry for sounding elementary; I'm still new to web app dev and I can't even think of what info I should provide, without advices from experts.
Live demos on http://robotwebtools.org/demos.html seem to be working for me, so my environment should be configured fine for RWT to work properly.
Environment:

Ubuntu 12.04. FF32.0, Chromium 37.0.2062.94
OSX 10.9.5  37.0.2062.122

If someone wants to run, there's a readme but the package is still under development and the way it installs is hacky for now.
It used to look like this:

Now. ROS3D.Viewer pane is not shown:

A:

We got it working by simply changing the way to specify the size of ROS3D.Viewer object (commit).
%1 Still, I'm not yet sure how it used to work and now doesn't, wondering if this issue I just opened in roslibjs is related or not.
%2 ref. I also opened a ticket in a dev repository, and opened a discussion in rwt forum.
