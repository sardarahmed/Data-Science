Q:

How to use python files in src/package_name in nodes folder?

I am writing a catkin project in python.
I would like to put nodes in the "node" directory, and other source files in the src/package_name directory.
However when I did that and tried to import a python module in the node file (located in the node folder) from the source directory I got an error saying the module didn't exist.
I couldn't find any tutorials on how to do this.
Do I have to somehow tell catkin to export my src folder?

A:

You have to create setup.py, and then add the catkin_python_setup() function to your CMakeLists.txt. A good example package to follow is nmea_navsat_driver.
