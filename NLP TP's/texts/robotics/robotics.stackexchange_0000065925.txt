Q:

How to draw a CollisionObject from fcl library in Rviz?

I created a collision object from FCL library as follows:
        boost::shared_ptr<Sphere> Shpere0(new Sphere(0.5));
        Transform3f tf0 ; 
         tf0.setIdentity();
         tf0.setTranslation(Vec3f(0,0,0));
         tf0.setQuatRotation(Quaternion3f(0, 0, 0, 0));
         CollisionObject co0(Shpere0, tf0);

// I want to draw the Collision Object in Rviz..
Any suggestions ??
