Q:

What will happen to ROS 1 once Python 2.7 is no more maintained?

Now, whenever I try to install a Python 2.7 package, I get the warning:

DEPRECATION: Python 2.7 will reach the end of its life on January 1st, 2020. Please upgrade your Python as Python 2.7 won't be maintained after that date

There is less than 1 year and, AFAIK, ROS 1 is still the main distribution of ROS (and ROS 2 maybe is not even ready).
What will happen to ROS 1, once Python 2.7 is no more supported? AFAIK, ROS 1 only supports Python 2.7.

A:

There are a couple of very interesting discussions on this topic on ROS Discourse.
ROS1 to ROS2 transition plan
Planning future ROS1 distributions
Long story short, they plan to release a ROS1 distribution in 2020 with Python3 support.
That N-distribution will probably be the last ROS1 distribution, given the fact that ROS2 is growing very fast and for most of the users it could be already considered stable.
