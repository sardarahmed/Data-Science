Q:

depth_image to point cloud

Hello,
I want to convert my depth_image to point_cloud, so I use the package "depth_image_proc".
The depth_image_proc to point_cloud_xyz needs two infos:

camera_info (sensor_msgs/CameraInfo)
image_rect (sensor_msgs/Image)

The Robot that I used published these infos over the topics. My question is, how can I start this conversation with a roslaunch file?
