Q:

Advertise multiple services with same srv

I have several simultaneously active services that have the same data type for both the Request and Response fields. Can I use the same .srv file for all of the services? Or should I create a uniquely named .srv file for each service (the contents of which would be identical)?
If it's technically acceptable to re-use the same .srv file, is it considered good or bad practice?

A:

Yes; you can re-use the same .srv for multiple services, and it's generally considered good practice.
