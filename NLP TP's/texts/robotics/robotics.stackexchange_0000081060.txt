Q:

problem with catkin_make, rospack find package but not catkin

Hi, I tried to building a node (chapter2_tutorials) but I can't build the package
I created a workspace at home/user/ros_workspace
I put the package in this folder --> chapter2_tutorials.
When I try to find this package with rospack find chapter2_tutorials, it is ok.
But when I try to execture catkin_make --pkg chapter2_tutorials I have:
Packages "chapter2_tutorials" not found in the workspace.
For information, I put at the end of bashrc
source /home/user/ros_workspace/catkin/devel/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~ros_workspace:/opt/ros/kinetic/share

Don't mess with ROS_PACKAGE_PATH manually. I would remove the export line from your .bashrc. Also, it's /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash that you should be sourcing first and foremost. Is that in your .bashrc ?

Hi,
Thanks to help me.
But if I remove the export line, ROS don't find my package in my personnal workspace (ros_workspace) when I execute "rospack find chapter2_tutorials"

A:

chapter2_tutorials is a rosbuild package so you need to use rosmake tool: rosmake chapter2_tutorials
