Q:

how to connect to an already running roscore from a tethered usb device

hi
i am trying to connect to an already running roscore with a tethered usb device.
situation is as follows:

i have a running roscore on a
ubuntu machine
after the
roscore is up, i connect an android
tablet to the computer and create a
network connection using usb
tethering
i am using ros android
to communicate with the roscore

note:

connecting the tablet with usb tethering creates a new usb network device over which i want to talk to the roscore
the tablet may be connected and disconnected several times without re-starting the roscore
also maybe other clients connect to the master using a ethernet connection

has anyone an idea how to do that ?  how would the ros network setup look like (master uri / ros ip / ros hostname) ?

A:

Seems like i found a working solution myself.
this also works if you have the following setup:
running roscore on a machine A
connect ethernet cable and get ip adress via dhcp
communicate from a machine B via network to roscore on machine A
the solution is to set up a network bridge on machine A which bridges to all other network devices (e.g usb0, eth0 ...). Assign a static IP to the bridge device and set ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP to that ip. Start the roscore.
When plugin the ethernet cable or tablet (...) just restart the bridge adapter using ifconfig down/up and all devices can communicate with the core using the bridge adapter's ip
