Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rostopic pub

whenever I type in terminal:
rostopic pub call (/cmd_nose qbo_arduqbo/Nose [0,0,'test'] 2)
rostopic pub call (-1 /cmd_mouth qbo_arduqbo/Mouth [0,0,'test'] [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0])

my robot smiles and has a green nose LED lit.
But, when I type it in a rospy script, I get a syntax error.
HOW can I do this correctly. I have tried almost everything.
Thanks in Advance@@
:-)

A:

You cannot just type commands into a python script. You'll need to use Python syntax. Check out the ROS beginner tutorials for the basics.
If you just want a script that lists commands, use a shell script.
