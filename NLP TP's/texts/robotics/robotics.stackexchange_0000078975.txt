Q:

Cannot build my package due to ros/Joy.h not being found

Seems like a pretty simple error to get past, but catkin_make cannot seem to find ros/Joy.h.
/home/sharan/catkin_ws/src/zlab_drone/src/fly_from_joy.cpp:4:21: fatal error: ros/Joy.h: No such file or directory. compilation terminated.

I have already included joy into my CMakeLists.txt. Not sure what else to do:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  ardrone_autonomy
  cv_bridge
  image_transport
  roscpp
  rospy
  sensor_msgs
  std_msgs
  joy
)

Seems to be a pretty easy error to look over, does no one know the answer?

A:

I found the answer to be quite simple actually. Basically #include <sensor_msgs/Joy.h> instead of #include<ros/Joy.h> within your .cpp files.
