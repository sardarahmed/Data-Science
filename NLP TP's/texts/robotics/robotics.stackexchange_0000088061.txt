Q:

ros2: ros2 pkg create for python package problem

Hi
I created ROS2 packages using
ros2 pkg create package_name

Whenever, I do that, it creates a C++ package with CMakeList.txt.
I tried to use the option --build-type, but it only suggests cmake and ament_cmake as build type. There is no option for ament_python.
I want to create a python package, but could not see any means to do that. Should I write setup.py and package.xml manually or there is a command to do it?
Also, I understood that Python code should be in a Python package, and C++ code should be a C++ package and could be merged, where as in ROS1, Python and C++ can at the same package. Is my understanding correct?
PS. I am using latest bouncy version in Ubuntu Bionic.
Thanks
Anis

A:

I assume you are referring to ros2 pkg create? This command has been added in https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/42 and atm only supports generating CMake projects. If you want to create a Python package you need to do that by hand for now (using existing Python ROS packages as templates).

I opened a ticket for ament_python support. https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/issues/125
I labeled it as a "good first issue", because I think the infrastructure should allow to extend it for python rather easily. So if you feel motivated, you may want to open a PR for supporting it. :)
