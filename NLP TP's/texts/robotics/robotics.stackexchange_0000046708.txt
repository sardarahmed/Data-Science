Q:

error occurred when hokuyo node is launched

I downloaded the hokuyo node, made it. When I tried to use the "hokuyo_test.launch" file given in the package to launch the hokuyo node, an exception threw out:
[ WARN] [1356005675.931956581]: The use_rep_117 parameter has not been specified and has been automatically set to true.  This parameter will be removed in Hydromedusa.  Please see: http://ros.org/wiki/rep_117/migration
[ERROR] [1356005680.166530146]: Exception thrown while opening Hokuyo.timeout reached (in hokuyo::laser::laserReadline) You may find further details at http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting

I read the troubleshooting page, but there wasn't any description about "timeout".

I m actually using a serial usb converter cable, and i set the param “port” as "/dev/ttyUSB0", but i still get the timeout error

Are you running a URG via the serial connection? Why not just use USB directly?

A:

Looks like your port isn't set up properly.
I suggest plugging in your LiDAR to a USB port & running the following command to give get rw permissions:
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
