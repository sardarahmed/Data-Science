Q:

How to create a new ros topic for specific messages

Topics in ROS are strongly typed. I need to publish and subscribe messages I have created for hector_uav_msgs folder but existing topics don't support them. How to start creating from scratch a new rostopic so my own messages can be applied?
Any suggestion will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

Thanks for your answer. However, my point is to publish/subscribe new message types. Summing up, a new topic where I can use the messages. Hector_quadrotor topics have their own messages and even inserting my new messages correctly in hector_uav_msgs, I haven't figured out how to pub/sub them yet
