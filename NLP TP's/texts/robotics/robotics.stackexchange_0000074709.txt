Q:

how to define ROS kinetic to use python3 instead of python2.7?

Hey,
I want to use Qt5 and python3 in ROS. I read that ROS kinetic should support python3. However I haven't found any instruction about the proper way to configure PYTHONPATH, CATKIN, etc.
Is there any proper way that I can do that without loosing ROS functionality?
Thanks in advance

Hello, did you happen to find any way to get ROS to work with Python3?

Were you able to get ROS running for python3?

A:

No ROS distribution officially supports Python 3. ROS Kinetic uses Qt 5 though, e.g. for rqt and rviz.
If you want to try it anyway you need to build everything from source (following the "normal" from source instructions). But before you will need to install all Python dependencies (e.g. catkin_pkg) for Python 3. Since the Debian packages are not side-by-side installable with the Python 2 version using a virtualenv will likely be the easiest way. The virtualenv will also ensure that python is pointing to a Python 3 interpreter. Otherwise you would need to pass a custom interpreter to the build (like -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3).
Anyway if you go that route you should expect problems and will find things which simply don't work with Python 3.
Update:
things are changing with the Noetic release coming up in less than a year which does target Python 3. Please see the latest instructions in the wiki about the topic: http://wiki.ros.org/UsingPython3

As a side note; where can I find the status/plans of Python 3 adoption in ROS?

I don't believe there is anyone working on it actively, but we are quite close to have full support.
See my answer below for details.
