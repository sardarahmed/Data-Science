Q:

How to spawn sdf object in Ignition Gazebo?

How can I spawn a model into a running simulation in Ignition Gazebo?
I'm looking for something like rosrun gazebo spawn_model but for Ignition.
This was the closest thing I found but I couldn't get it working so far:

A:

You already have the answer in your link above. There is an example in ros_ign_gazebo_demos:
<node
  pkg="ros_ign_gazebo"
  type="create"
  name="spawn_model"
  args="-world <world_name> -name <model_name> -param robot_description">
</node>

Is there a ROS2 Galactic node equivalent to remove an entity? I've  just found a node to create an entity here.
