Q:

Can't use camera images from turtlebot on the workstation laptop

I've checked that  I can communicate to the turtlebot and from the turtlebot to the workstation.  On the workstation, I can check  rostopic list and the see camera topic that I want to use.  If I try to see the camera image in RViz nothing shows up but it also shows that the topic is there.
If I go onto the turtlebot laptop I can use RViz to see the camera without any problems.

A:

Try to echo the image topic with rostopic echo <camera_node>/image_raw. If there is nothing in return, then there may be a configuration problem.
In this case double-check that ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP environment variables are correctly set on both computers.

I run
rostopic echo /camera/rgb/image_raw

And I never get any response back from the terminal.  But at the same time if I do
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color

I can see the camera image.

Did you check ROS_IP and ROS_MASTER_URI? I had the same issue a while ago and the problem was indeed in these.

I got it working, somehow.  Not sure what, if anything, I did though.  I have trouble now though with losing the network connection.  Shortly after the workstation gets the camera image it just freezes and I can't ssh to the robot anymore.

It can be a problem of network bandwidth. Try to use compression -- Transport Hint in Camera plugin in RViz.
