Q:

How to prevent data time travel?

Hi community.
I have some trouble in stereo camera data logging that some old data pushed after newer one.

The way to save this data is like this: prepare empty list and push new data in each subscription and then save this list as csv.
How can I prevent this problem in a real situation?
Thank you.

A:

Try out the time sequencer message filter http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters#Time_Sequencer .  It looks like you want a buffer size to handle 3 seconds of messages.
