Q:

Getting started with Jetson Tegra K1

After working for a long time on my Arduino Due, I needed a better and more powerful prototyping platform for my future projects. For which, I have placed an order for NVIDIA Jetson Tegra K1 board which runs on linux and supports CUDA based development. Being a newbie to Linux, I have no idea where to start from and what to do for getting started with code execution on the Jetson board. Please suggest the initial steps required and from where can I get familiar to Linux environment...
Thank you

I would recommend looking into ROS. It's a communications protocol that allows for easy communication between two pieces of code. It works with python and cpp and handles all the  building and compiling. There are a ton of ROS libraries, called packages, which the community has put together and maintains. 
It looks like ros indigo has been successfully built in using the jetson tk1.

Here are some ros tutorials that cover all of the basics.
