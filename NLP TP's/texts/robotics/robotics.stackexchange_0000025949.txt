Q:

Is there catkin support for atlas_msgs and osrf_msgs?

I tried to build a catkin package that depends on atlas_msgs and osrf_msgs.
I get the following error:

CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:71 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package atlas_msgs.

  Set atlas_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file
  for atlas_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

    atlas_msgsConfig.cmake
    atlas_msgs-config.cmake

I looked in the bitbucket groovy branch of drcsim, but don't see those files there either.
We are developing in groovy, and would like to catkinize where we can.  Is there a recommended approach?

Thanks, ticketed, will work on getting it in to drcsim 2.3.
