Q:

Octomap with ubuntu 11.10

I'm using ROS electric and I am following the tutorial here
and I got a problem when I run rosdep install octomap_mapping
I guess it's because I didn't rightly "add the source directory to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (e.g. in ~/.bashrc), source that file" but I am new to ubuntu and ROS so I don't know what's the right way doing it.  Can anybody give me detailed instructions? Thanks a lot !
By the way, the error message I got after I run rosdep install octomap_mapping is
chong@ubuntu:~/rospkg$ rosdep install octomap_mapping
Failed to find rosdep octomap for package octomap on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install octomap

and my .bashrc has the following related lines:

source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/rospkg:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

A:

Apparently you are using ROS electric, with the trunk of octomap_mapping from SVN. I just recently changed the trunk to build against fuerte, and that requires an "octomap" system package as rosdep (ros-fuerte-octomap).
Just use the electric branch of octomap:
svn co http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/octomap_mapping-electric/ octomap_mapping

or the bre-built binary packages as joq suggested. Alternatively, you can also upgrade to the latest ROS fuerte.

Thanks.It seems to work.But how about octovis?Is it automatically installed with ocotomap_mapping or I have to separately install it somewhere? And could you please give specific instructions on how to install ocotomap_mapping under electric? I'm new to ubuntu so I am worried if I mess up something.

See @joq's answer on how to install the package pre-compiled, you don't need to check something out and compile then.
Comment by AHornung on 2012-06-03:
octovis as GUI is not installed by default with the library. If you upgrade to ROS fuerte, you can install the octovis package with "sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-octovis". For electric, you need to download the complete octomap package (non-ros) from octomap.sf.net and compile yourself.

I see. Thanks. One more question: if I use the non-ros version of octovis, is it still possible to view the colored map? Cuz when i use that to open the filename.bt, i can only see the depth map with no colors
Comment by AHornung on 2012-06-04:
Yes, any recent version of octovis can display colored maps. But they have to be in a .ot file, .bt files do not contain color information. See http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/projects/datasets/octomap/ for details and example files.

Thanks. I'm trying to use rgbdslam package to work with octomap. it seems rgbdslam package cannot save as .ot file. it can only save as pcd file.

I downloaded the non-ros package and compiled the whole package myself. But, I don't know how to open the octovis GUI to view the built map. I tried $ octovis in terminal. But it says command not found.
