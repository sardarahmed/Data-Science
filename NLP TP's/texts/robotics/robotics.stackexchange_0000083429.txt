Q:

Custom ROS, Install Package?

http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
After following through with this tutorial I have been able to setup ROS indigo without issue on a Raspberry Pi. Though was wondering how I would install packages from GitHub, or custom packages? I am asking this because the package install process is so strange with this custom distro.

Can you clarify what is "so strange with this custom distro"?

@gvdhoorn
I meant strange by this command. Im new to ROS and all other documentation shows a more straightforward approach using rosinstall
rosinstall_generator #package-name# --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only --exclude roslisp --tar > indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall

A:

As the tutorial suggests you can build another packages with rosinstall_generator ros_comm ANOTHER_PACKAGES --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only --exclude roslisp --tar > indigo-custom_ros.rosinstall.
Building your own packages should be easy after this with regular catkin.

I apologize for my naivety, I am new to ROS. So if I have my own custom package that I create through a catkin workspace I shouldn't have any issues building?
I would just have to run the run rosdep install to get all dependencies then rebuild the workspace?

Exactly. Or at least this worked for me.

Ofc if you don't use GUI on your raspberry you won't be able to build some packages because of their requirements. But other packages should be fine.
