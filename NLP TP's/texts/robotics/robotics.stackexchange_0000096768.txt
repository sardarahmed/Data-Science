Q:

How can I add 'foxy' as an acceptable version-tag on awswers.ros.org

The Instruction for tags is:

"You must at least tag the rosdistro you are using, such as indigo, kinetic, lunar, melodic, or ardent."

The error text if you fail to comply is:

"At least one of the following tags is required : boxturtle, cturtle, diamondback, electric, fuerte, groovy, hydro, indigo, jade, kinetic, lunar, melodic, noetic, r2b3, ardent, bouncy, crystal, dashing, eloquent, ros1 or ros2"

shouldn't theses match? and why no love for Foxy? :)

A:

This is something that only the ROS Answers admins can do.
This may change with the Askbot version, but there should be an list of "Mandatory tags" on this page:

How does one go about notifying an admin about such a thing? Is there an issue tracker somewhere?
