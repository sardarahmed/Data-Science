Q:

openni2.launch fails with ROS Indigo, USB3.0

With my configuration, openni2.launch and openni.launch are fails and I have no idea for the reason.
Could you help me ?
When I launch openni2.launch, I have an error as follows.

process[camera/camera_nodelet_manager-1]: started with pid [11714]
[ INFO] [1412458420.971125192]: Initializing nodelet with 4 worker threads.
process[camera/driver-2]: started with pid [11735]

    Could not open "1d27/0600@1/9": Failed to set USB interface!

My laptop is MacBookPro and it has only USB3.0 ports, No USB2.0 port ...
Someone suggests to use "ASUS Xtion USB 3.0 Hotfix, however it seems that I need Windows OS.
I don't have it.
The configuration is as follows.

OS : Ubuntu 14.04
ROS : Indigo
PC : MacBookPro(USB3.0 x 2, USB2.0 x 0, including Mac OS X and Ubuntu 14.04)
tried packages : openni.launch, openni2.launch
Used device : Xtion Pro Live

What should I do ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

For the older xtion (0600), you should definitely be running openni.launch unless you get the hotfix installed. You could try running windows in a VM or using someone else's computer, it's a pretty quick process.
You could also try fiddling with the endpoints.

My xtion is the older version and openni.launch cannot also work well. It generates error(Failed to set USB Interface!)...
Actually, xtion worked with Mac OS X, NiViewer can be shown.
I fiddled with the endpoints but it doesn't work...
Can I get hotfix installed with only Ubuntu ??

Not afaik. The error is probably due to USB3 incompatibility. You could also try removing xhci (http://www.pcl-developers.org/xhci-hcd-I-hate-you-USB-3-0-and-Primesense-Asus-Xtion-td5707949.html), but this seems like a lot more trouble than running windows in a vm.
