Q:

How and where are the idl files generated for default examples in ROS2?

For the example : demo_nodes_cpp we use std_msgs rather than some customised messages. Thus we do not need to define any msg folder. So where and how the idl files are generated ?

A:

When the std_msgs package is being built the .msg / .srv files are being transformed into .idl files. Those are being installed by the package into share/std_msgs/msg/dds_<connext|opensplice>.
For prototyping and testing using messages from std_msgs is fine. But for real interfaces of ROS nodes you should define your own messages with custom semantic.
