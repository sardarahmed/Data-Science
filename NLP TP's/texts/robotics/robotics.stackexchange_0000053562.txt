Q:

catkin_package INCLUDE_DIR set CFlags to .pc under devel/ but not set CFlags to installspace

Hi,
I have a package with
catkin_project(
 INCLUDE_DIRS include1 include2
)

and this generate .pc under devel (./devel/lib/pkgconfig/.pc) that contians
Cflags: -I.../include1 -I../include2

but .pc under build/..../catkin_generated/installspace/.pc becomes
Cflags: -I/tmp/catkin_ws/install/include

It this expected behavior? Why it is not
Cflags -I/tmp/catkin_ws/install/include/<package>/include1 -I/tmp/catkin_ws/install/include/<package>/include2

A:

This is expected behavior. In install space you should have installed all header (from potentially various locations in source) into a single include folder (following FHS).

With catkin, you need to explicitly install any headers you export. See: http://ros.org/doc/groovy/api/catkin/html/howto/building_libraries.html#installing

Thanks for the answer! I'm trying to release 3rd-parity library that does not follows FHS standard, using catkin/bloom. Is there any good examples for this?
