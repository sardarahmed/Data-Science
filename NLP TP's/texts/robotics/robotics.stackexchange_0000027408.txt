Q:

Very weird behaviour destroys my robot and makes it fly around

I generated an sdf from a urdf for robot (urdf fully functional while using the real robot)
Can somebody give me some hints about what might be the cause of this weird behaviour?
If you need to understand what the robot exactly is you can watch this video

A:

Apparently something was wrong with internal collisions. I had a script that automatically transformed urdf to sdf but I guess it didn't work that good. I am now loading urdf directly to Gazebo and it seems that the problem is solved.

Was the script the official urdf -> sdf generator?

@Alex No it was a script my colleague wrote for another simple robot but it turned out it didn't work very well causing a lot of internal collisions. Spawning a robot directly from an URDF was also simpler with Gazebo.
