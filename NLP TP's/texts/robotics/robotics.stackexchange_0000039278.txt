Q:

Eclipse and Android Tutorial PubSub Errors

I have been battling through installing a development environment to use rosjava to communicate with a robot (pc) from an android device.  I am relatively new to ROS and Android programming.
I have managed to finally get pubsub installed on my phone and functioning (from the command line), thanks to a lot of tidbits from everyone on Ros answers.
I now seem to be having issues getting the project to run from an eclipse environment.  I created a new Android Project and created from existing source, pointing to android_tutorial_pubsub.
This left me with some unresolved errors.
My first attempt to fix this I added all the jars I could from android_gingerbread and rosjava until the errors were gone.  I was then able to get the app on my phone but it would fail every time I tried to run it.  I did notice that under properties->android the android_gingerbread reference had a big red X next to it.
My next attempt was remove all the library references and to create a new android project from existing source and point to android_gingerbread to bring it into eclipse.  This removed all the errors and resulted in a green check mark beside the android_gingerbread reference.
But now when I try to compile I simply get a java heap error, crashing eclipse.  I've increased the size of the heap but it just keeps happening.
Is importing android_gingerbread as an Android project not the right way to import it into eclipse?  Is there another environment that I can use to modify the pubsub code?

I pulled the new files and compiled the rosjava_core fine.  But the Android_core won't compile now.  It fails on UpdateProject.  It can't seem to find the command android in the folder to 'update project'  But if I call android from the directory it opens the SDK manager fine.  So the path is there.

Ok now parts of android_core compile, had to add -target 1 to the gradle build file to target android-10 based on my target list. I still get a java heap problem when trying to run in eclipse though.   android_honeycomb_mr2 won't compile do I need it for pubsub?

A:

There were some significant changes in the past couple days that left android_core broken. However, android_core and its documentation have been updated as of today. I suggest pulling and trying again.
