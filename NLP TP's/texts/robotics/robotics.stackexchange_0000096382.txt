Hello, I did the following tutorial, with Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS2

And I am doing the following:
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_machine_learning/
All ok, but, in the item 24.2.1 Set State:(https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_machine_learning/#set-state?
I can't find the file: turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/urdf/turtlebot3_burger.gazebo.xacro
are only the files turtlebot3_burger.urdf and others .urdf files.
Can you help me, please. Where is the file or how can install or create it.
Thank you.

A:

Hi,
The issue is that the turtlebot3/turtlebot3_description/urdf/turtlebot3_burger.gazebo.xacro is only used for ROS1 versions of the package. You can find the .gazebo.xacro files in any of the ROS1 branches of the turtlebot _description package.
For ROS2, the gazebo simulation of TB3 is changed to  .sdf files, by default those are stored in turtlebot3_gazebo/models/.
The turtlebot3_burger model file is turtlebot3_gazebo/models/turtlebot3_burger/model.sdf.  All the plugin configurations are done there.
Hope this helps!
