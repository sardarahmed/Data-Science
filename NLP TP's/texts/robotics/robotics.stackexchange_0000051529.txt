Q:

help!-WARNING: ROS_MASTER_URI port [80] does not match this roscore [11311]

Hi,
I was trying to connect to the turtlebot and I think I accidentally changed the ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME. Now, whenever I run roscore I get this:
WARNING: ROS_MASTER_URI port [80] does not match this roscore [11311]
Any help on this would be appreciated. Thanks.

Ok I figured it out.. Just changed my ROS_MASTER_URI to localhost. ie., export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
