Q:

roslaunch sick_tim551_2050001

Hello,
After catkin_make of tim_sick branch indigo
and after  run roscore
and after plugged sick_timm551 by USB
I try to launch this :
roslaunch sick_tim551_2050001 ~/catkin_ws/src/sick_tim/launch/sick_tim.launch
I have this :
[/home/colin/catkin_ws/src/sick_tim/launch/sick_tim.launch] is neither a launch file in package [sick_tim551_2050001] nor is [sick_tim551_2050001] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
I have not log file into .ros/log folder
Any idea ?
Thanks a lot

A:

The arguments for roslaunch are either a package and a launch file name, or the path to a launch file. Not both
Try with either the package and launch file name:
roslaunch sick_tim sick_tim551_2050001.launch 

OR the full path:
roslaunch ~/catkin_ws/src/sick_tim/launch/sick_tim.launch

Just for future reference: This should be roslaunch sick_tim sick_tim551_2050001.launch.
