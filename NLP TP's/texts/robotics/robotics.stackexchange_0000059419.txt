Perhaps you just have to change your fixed frame to /map in rviz.

I tried, but it's not a solution

You should give more details about what you are trying.  Note that the map in Stage is not really a map in the sense of being some model or reference used by the robot, but rather it is the ground truth used by Stage for simulation, and your robot may not have direct access to it.

A:

If you are using map_server to publish the map, then you can change the location of the map origin in the corresponding YAML file.
