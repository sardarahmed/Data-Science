Q:

Tool for message inhibition / injection

Is there any GUI tool that allows live monitoring of ROS traffic, and potentially modification of these messages by either inhibiting them or say overriding values?
Basically something like rxbag or rqt gui but with the ability to modify messages on the fly (per example force a certain signal to a value, inhibit a message, etc.)
In some sense it's a combination of the topic_tools mux/drop.
This is driven by a desire to simulate arbitrary sensor failures for a system which uses ROS for message passing to a monitoring station.
Anyway, I am hoping something like this already exists. If not, does someone have an idea of whether this is doable at all? Seems like it'd be a hybrid between topic_tools/mux & drop?
Thanks,

A:

The only way to accomplish this is to have a node which subscribes to the source of the topic and republishes it to another topic which the destination is subscribed to. Then that node can manipulate, pause, drop, or what ever you want before republishing the data.
So you would have:

Where you introduce a new node (possibly just a python script) which subscribes to the original topic (/cmd_vel), modifies it, and republishes it to a new topic (/scaled_cmd_vel) which the destination now subscribes to instead of the original topic.
This must be setup before everything is running (it can be configured at launch time but not run time).
It is possible to update the nodes at run time, but there is no easy way to do this, nor any tool that does this that I am aware of.
