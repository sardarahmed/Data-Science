Q:

check if topic is being published to without subscribing

In our project we want to write a node to check sensor nodes for possible errors. One of the checked criterion is, if the topics of the node are actually published and not just have publisher.
Is it possible to check for published messages or publishing frequency without actually subscribing?
The reason behind it is, that some sensors like cameras publishes large amount of data, which slow down the checknode.
Not suitable solutions:

"rospy.get_published_topics" does not check, if the publisher is publishing at all.
rostopic hz subscribes the topic
time saving solutions require subscription at some point

Thank you.

Edit/Solution:

I'm not sure (hence a comment), but
there is a chance you could do this
using topic statistics.

This is our solution. Thanks.

It is correct that there are already subscribers to the topics. We want to check on a running system.
Thank you for your answer gvdhoorn. It is definitly new to us and what we searched for.

topic statistics are still per-connection, so if there are no subscribers, there will not be any statistics.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-01-30:
If there are no subscribers, it doesn't make sense to want to check for "publishing frequency" anyway :)
I assumed (perhaps wrongly) that the OP had subscribers, but didn't want to add more just to check node liveness.
