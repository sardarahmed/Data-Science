Q:

How to get real inverse kinematic locations WRT to end-effector

Hey, beginner here
I am making a custom manipulator and I was wondering if there is a package or some sort of library I could use to find inverse kinematic locations of an object in the world with respect to the endeffector and base_link, please give list the sensors I will need and how to execute it, thanks for the help.

A:

What you're looking for it moveit the ROS manipulator planning and control package. This can be used to simulate, plan and control an arm. As a part of that when a manipulator has been configured you can use this to perform inverse kinematics.
Can you explain a little more about the problem you're trying to solve?

I am making a 4dof arm and I, for now, I am simulating it with Moveit. What don't I understand is how will I code for the servo motors in the real arm? I am making this project on Arduino if that helps. thanks for the help.
