Q:

adafruit 16 channel servo driver package

After a bit of a web search, I have come up dry on a ROS package for the Adafruit 16 Channel Servo Driver Board.  It wouldn't be difficult to make one, I just want to make sure no one has seen one before I reinvent the wheel.   Go to  this link for the board itself. I'm thinking a simple subscription node that sends the necessary I2C commands to x40 from a RPi, and maybe a GUI joystick node that posts a topic with the 16 servo values.  If anyone has seen it, please let me know.  Thanks!

A:

hi,
i use the https://www.adafruit.com/products/2327  16-Channel PWM / Servo HAT for Raspberry Pi  which is perhaps the same chip.
i got a https://github.com/flobotics/flobotics_servo_pwm_pi  listener node, to which you can send int16 values for every servo, feel free to use it , or modify it
