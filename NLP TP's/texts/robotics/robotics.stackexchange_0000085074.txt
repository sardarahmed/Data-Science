Q:

Drone keeps rising (in simulation) after takeoff

Hi,
I am currently using the tum_simulator + ROS + gazebo to run a simulation for the Parrot A.R. drone 2.0.
When I publish the takeoff message ( rostopic pub -1 /ardrone/takeoff std_msgs/Empty )  the drone rises ( in the gazebo simulation)
but doesn't stop. I can't make it stop even by pressing the "lower z-velocity" (rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  '{linear:  {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: -1.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}')  command. (These commands have been taken from official tum_simulator ROS wiki page here )
( And yes, I am keeping the teleoperation terminal active so I can see my commands work
but the drone keeps rising )

A:

Apparently, others have had this problem too and the solution was to install some hector packages:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-hector-gazebo
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-hector-sensors-gazebo
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-hector-xacro-tools
