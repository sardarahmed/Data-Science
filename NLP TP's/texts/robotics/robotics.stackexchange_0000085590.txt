Q:

cant print to console anymore ROS_INFO or std::cout

Whenever I try publishing an output to the command line in my node I receive the following error:
"Attempt to set a screen on a child window."
I couldnt find any help on my particular problem online. The strange thing is that the output to the console worked fine with either ROS_INFO or std::cout some weeks back.
I didnt use it since and cant think about any things I have changed which causes this error. Maybe someone on here knows.
The output on the console of the ros node on the start up is this:
Waiting 0.2 seconds after advertising topics...[ INFO] [1519836743.658042843]: rviz version 1.12.15

A:

They have similar issues in here and apparently is related with qt4 that needs migration into qt5. This is specially relevant because from indigo to kinetic thats precisely one of the changes (qt4 was deprecated in favor of qt5).
