I downvoted this question for a number of reasons: it isn't clearly written, has multiple questions rolled into one, and doesn't contain enough details about your problems.

ROSanswers is a MUCH friendlier place than the forums that these guides on asking questions were written for, but they may help. [1] http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx [2] http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

A:

To answer one of your questions: you need to learn about quaternions, which are how rotations are represented within ROS.
These questions, especially the links in the answers, are probably a good start.
