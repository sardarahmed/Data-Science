Q:

ROS Navigation Stack, Changing Global Planner

Hello,
How can I change the default Global Planner (Dijkstra) to A* or SBPL.
The tutorial says for example: "The global planner can be used with move_base simply by setting the "base_global_planner" parameter to "SBPLLatticePlanner"".
Where can I set "base_global_planner" parameter?
Thanks

A:

As you have mentioned, move_base has a parameter called "base_global_planner" that you can set to whichever planner you want to use. You can do this in the launchfile that launches move_base by adding the following line:
<param name="base_global_planner" value="your_planner_name"/>

The planner has to be of the type nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner. You can alternatively supply the parameter from the command line as mentioned here.
