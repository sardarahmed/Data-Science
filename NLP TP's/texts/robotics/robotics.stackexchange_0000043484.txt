Q:

Failed to setup the capture workspace for object_recognition

Hi, I am following [quick guide of recognition kitchen].(http://ecto.willowgarage.com/recognition/ros_quickguide.html)
But when I run this code in my third terminal:
  rosrun object_recognition_core orb_template.py -o my_textured_plane

I got this message in terminal:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "./orb_template.py", line 3, in <module>
      from object_recognition_capture.orb_capture import *
  ImportError: No module named object_recognition_capture.orb_capture

Does anybody know how to get this module(object_recognition_capture.orb_capture)?
I am using electric on Ubuntu 10.10.
Thanks in advance.
Edit
After I:
  sudo apt-get install ros-electric-object-recognition

The error message became:

A:

Did you install object_recognition from source or as a deb package? I just tested with...
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-object-recognition

... and it worked (at least I got past the point where you got that error). Make sure you don't have another copy of object_recognition checked out somewhere on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
