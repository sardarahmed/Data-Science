Q:

Global planner with curvature limit

Hi all,
I'm looking for a global path planner (base_global_planner) with a feature of limiting the curvature (or turning radius) of the path.
I found teb_local_planner which can configure the minimum turning radius, but it's designed as a local planner.
Does anyone knows a path planner compatible with curvature limitation?
Or, is there a way to use teb_local_planner as a global planner, just for publishing the entire path to the goal?
My environment: Ubuntu 18.04, ROS Melodic

There is a nice explanation and a link to a tutorial

@osilva Thanks for the information, but I think that is not I want to do.
Both the explanation and tutorial assume that we have a pre-generated global path, but I need a way to get a global path considering its maximum curvature.
Actually I'm planning to use a self-made local planner rather than teb_local_planner, so a global planner with curvature limiting feature is my ideal.

A:

There's not one in the well-maintained or core nav stacks in ROS 1.
However, there is one for ROS 2 in the Smac Planner, the Hybrid-A* planner https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/packages/configuring-smac-planner.html
