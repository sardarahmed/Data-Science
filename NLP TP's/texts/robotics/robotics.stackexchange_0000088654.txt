Q:

Draw an OccupancyGrid?

Are there any ROS tools, or recommended third-party tools, for drawing a 2D grid that's output as a nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid? I could find an online grid editor that outputs to coordinates, then convert them, but I'm hoping there's an already-made tool.

I haven't used it myself, but if you have access to matlab, it would appear it has some infrastructure that could be helpful with this. See here.

There is a grid_map library. I'm using it to edit existing grid maps or creating new from scratch.

A:

The map_server loads an image + YAML file to publish a nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid. You can edit the image file in any image editor (e.g. GIMP, Photoshop, etc). The wiki page for map_server has details of how to setup the YAML file that tells map_server how to interpret the image.
