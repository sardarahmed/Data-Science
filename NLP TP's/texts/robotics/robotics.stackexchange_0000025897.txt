Q:

Reduce karma required for commenting

New users start with 1 karma point, which means that they can't post comments right away. This leads to "comment answers", because new users have no other choice. We have this issue already over at ROS Answers (see here) and it is starting here as well.
I also found out that on AskBot's Q&A this limit is set to 1 (see here).
Hence, I suggest we lower it to 1 as well.
