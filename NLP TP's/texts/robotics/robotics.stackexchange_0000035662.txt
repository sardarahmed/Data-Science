Q:

unable to build gazebo package in ROS

while running rosmake gazebo. i get the following error:
/home/pragyan/tredext/biome_simulator/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/build/gazebo/server/audio_video/AudioDecoder.cc:105:49: error: ‘avcodec_decode_audio2’ was not declared in this scope
I tried to uncomment the use of this function and tried to make it the next error was related OREG. Can anyone just tell me the solution to this problem?
Thanks in advance :)
