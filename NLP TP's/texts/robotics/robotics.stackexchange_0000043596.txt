Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: publish array

hi at all,
easy question (or at least i hope so): how can I write a publisher which publishes an float64array? the problem is, i'm quite new to c++ so i don't understand all of the lines in the tutorial, where a string is published.
thx in advance

A:

Whereever the string message would be filled, when you fill the array, you would use push_back as ROS translates the arrays to c++ vectors.
