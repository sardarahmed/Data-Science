Q:

satisfying package dependencies

I have package that depends on the willow garage pr2_cockpit package.  Is there a way to inform a user that this dependency exists if the package is not already installed (besides looking through the output of rosmake or the package manifest file and checking manually)?  I tried adding "ros-diamondback-pr2-cockpit" as an external dependency in the manifest file.  However, rosdep install for my package failed with the following error:
rosdep install <package_name>
Failed to find rosdep ros-diamondback-pr2-cockpit for package <package_name> on OS:ubuntu version:10.04
ERROR: ABORTING: Rosdeps [u'ros-diamondback-pr2-cockpit'] could not be resolved
Any suggestions of a structured way to install external ros packages would be nice.  Is rosinstall the only other option?
Thanks for any help.

A:

At the moment installation instructions usually consist of

install the following debian packages: ros-diamondback-foo ros-diamondback-bar
install this rosinstall file http://example.com/example.rosinstall

In general ros packages are not designed to be installed via rosdep.  Though it does work.  There are some tools in development to facilitate the installation of larger systems.  However the above system so far works in most cases.
