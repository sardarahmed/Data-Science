A:

OSRF actually has pre-made docker files with ROS installs for you to start with (https://hub.docker.com/r/osrf/ros/). After that, you just need to add your own use case specific files / configs / needs on top of a base ubuntu + ROS install.

I already pulled the container. Do you have a step by step that I can follow? I am a beginner in docker.
