Q:

I have a Problem in parsing OWL to Prolog Triples

Hi all,
(((1)))I do not have more experience in KnowRob, so I now try to run command and see its effects and so on
I was trying to parse Owl file into Prolog so I use this command
 owl_parse('home/amal/pizza.owl', false, false, true).

I get this error
   bash: syntax error near unexpected token `'home/amal/pizza.owl','

1- What is the Problem
2- I do not Understand Why false false true in the command ?!

(((2))) It always give me false, I flow this tutorial (Reasoning about objects at knowrob wiki) and also get false, so what is the problem

Terminal:
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~$ roscd knowrob_tutorial
amal@amal-HP-G62-Notebook-PC:~/ros/pkgs/tum-ros-pkg/knowledge/knowrob_tutorial$ rosrun rosprolog rosprolog knowrob_tutorial

I want to edit the Q, but does not want to do this and say "Could not post, because your karma is insufficient to publish links " I does not add links it is just a copy from my terminal, I was can do this in normal but does not know what is the problem now ?! so why?!
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-16:
What I want to edit I run 'roswtf' .... No package or stack in context,Static checks summary: No errors or warnings, ROS Master does not appear to be running.
Online graph checks will not be run.
ROS_MASTER_URI is [http://localhost:11311]

also I try http://ias.cs.tum.edu/kb/wiki/index.php/Reasoning_about_actions It work except this instruction '?- owl_parse('owl/pancake-making.owl', false, false, true).' ... I get this error "ERROR: toplevel: Undefined procedure: owl_parse/4 (DWIM could not correct goal)" ... also It is really exist!

@Ricky I get false, I think I have to read at SWI-Prolog, I Will start from HOWTO collection and , then try again. Do you recommend any else ?! Thanks
Comment by Po-Jen Lai on 2012-11-18:
I don't understand why you have to read SWI-Prolog? After running rosrun rosprolog rosprolog mod_vis you'll see the prompt that enables you to use owl_parse(). See this:http://i.imgur.com/CBTMP.png
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-19:
OK Thanks It is worked
Comment by Po-Jen Lai on 2012-11-19:
Good~  : )
Comment by Amal on 2012-11-23:
@Ricky It always give me false ?! and I am sure that I write the path correctly so What ?!
Comment by Po-Jen Lai on 2012-11-25:
I got false too. But I can still view the parsed instances in visualziation_canvas, so I think it's not a serious problem. I am not sure if there's anything wrong with false.

A:

The command
owl_parse('home/amal/pizza.owl', false, false, true).

should be used after you started the knowrob system by
rosrun rosprolog rosprolog mod_vis

The function you called is defined in owl_parser.pl of the package "thea"
owl_parse(URL, RDF_Load_Mode, OWL_Parse_Mode,Imports) :-
    (   RDF_Load_Mode=complete,!,rdf_retractall(_,_,_); true),
    retractall(rdf_db:rdf_source(_,_,_,_)),
    rdf_load_stream(URL,[URL],Imports),
    owl_parse(OWL_Parse_Mode).

It's some options, I don't understand the meaning of these arguments.If you are really interested in this, a way to understand them is to see where they are used. For example,
you can understand the meaning of "OWL_Parse_Mode" by tracing this
owl_parse(OWL_Parse_Mode).
