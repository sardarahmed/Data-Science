Q:

how to know the exact frame rate and angle of /scan on turtlebot?

We get an array of floats from the scan topic, but how do I know which number correspond to which angle? In our project, we want know the distance of the obstacle at exactly 0 degree, 90 degree and 180 degree.
Thanks!

The good people at Robot Ignite Academy posted an answer to this question, and I assume it is perfectly alright if I post a link to their video walk-thru answering this question, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFNNsDI2b6c&t=220s

Actually, it would be much better if you could give (at least) a summary here, instead of linking to a video that takes 13 minutes to explain this. Future readers that like the more visual approach of video explanations can then still decide to watch it, but for all others, text suffices.
