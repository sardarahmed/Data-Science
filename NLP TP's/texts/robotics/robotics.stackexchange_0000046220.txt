Q:

[groovy] pkg-config returns invalid libraries

Hello,
I recently tried to build my code in ros groove beta, and I get linking errors when linking with roscpp. The problem comes from invalid *.pc script. "pkg-config roscpp --libs" return "... -l/usr/lib/libboost_date_time-mt.so ..." and because gcc does not accept absolute paths for libraries this way it leads to linking error.
Is it intended behaviour of pkg-config ?
