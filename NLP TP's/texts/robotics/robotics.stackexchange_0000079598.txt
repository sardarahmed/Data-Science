Q:

reset CATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES

I am building a subset of the packages in my catkin workspace using CATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES. However, when I want to rebuild the whole workspace (without CATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES set), it still only builds the whitelisted packages. I assumed that the whitelist is only temporary for each build, but it seems like it is globally stored. I couldn't find any documentation on it.
If I want to change the whitelist, the only thing I can do is to remove build and devel. Can anyone provide me with some more information about CATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES, i.e. what exactly it does and where it is stored?

A:

Search for CATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES in the ROS wiki returned the following page. It describes the usage of that variable and how to revert back to building all packages: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/commands/catkin_make
