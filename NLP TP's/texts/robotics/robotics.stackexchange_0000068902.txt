Q:

[rospack] Error: stack/package roscpp not found

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS Hydro.
While creating a package in one of my directories, i wrote the following line of code to the terminal (because i was facing the problem mentioned in here):
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/<PATH TO THE DIRECTORY I WAS MAKING THE PACKAGE IN>

After adding this line, i'm facing this error:
[rospack] Error: stack/package roscpp not found

whenever i type the following code:
rospack find roscpp

Although the package roscpp is still present at this path: /opt/ros/hydro/share$
What is causing this issue?
How do i solve it?

A:

What is causing this issue?

With:

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/<PATH TO THE DIRECTORY I WAS MAKING THE PACKAGE IN> 

you are overwriting the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable, so that it only points to ~/<PATH TO THE DIRECTORY I WAS MAKING THE PACKAGE IN>. The default paths needed for ROS to function are now gone, hence the error message you received.
If you really must change/update ROS_PACKAGE_PATH manually, be sure to only add to it. Something like:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/user/path/to/dir/i/was/making/pkg/in:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

This inserts the new path and copies in the old entries.

How do i solve it?

Depending on how you setup your system, simply opening a new terminal could restore the old ROS_PACKAGE_PATH values. Alternatively, source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash should also set the variable to its default value.
