Q:

Imitating message types

Hi,
I am having a configuration where my rover is running mavros 0.13 and my laptop is running mavros 0.15. Therefore there is a difference in namespacing. As I am not able to recompile 0.15 for my rover easily (running out of time for my internship) I was wondering if it is allowed (or do-able) to change the messages of mavros. I think this is needed as I am not able to communicate with my rover as those version differences.
Can I clone the files in /opt/ros/indigo/include/ so I have a file which defines the message as mavros 0.13? Or should I create a .msg file in my own application which generates it for me?
It is for the specific /mavros/rc/override message. When starting mavros on my rover, running the application (ros_erle_teleoperation) the message type changes to the new 0.15 message type /mavros_msgs/rc/override and therefore I seem to not getting the device to work.
Regards,
Martin.
TL;DR - Can I duplicate the mavros/OverrideRCIn message in the folder /opt/ros/indigo/include to make mavros 0.13 on the rover communicate with mavros 0.15 on the laptop?

A:

You should install mavros 0.13 in an overlay on your laptop.  http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying
