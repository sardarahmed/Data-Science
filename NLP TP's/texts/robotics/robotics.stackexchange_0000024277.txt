Q:

ROS ssh launch issue

So I have a setup where I want to launch my ROS nodes via a launch file, which in turn will ssh into a udoo board and the launch the necessary files for hardware communication. The launch file works great normally when I do roslaunch, and I have set up a passwordless connection between the PC running ROS and udoo, using the ssh-rsa protocol.
I wanted to launch this on the robot upstart so used the robot-upstart package to create a service for launching. This is where my errors start, as the service does not be able to establish a ssh connection between the PC running ROS and the udoo board.
The error is as follows:

Not sure what is causing the error, any help/suggestions is appreciated. Happy to provide more information if needed. I am running ROS melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.

A:

The core error in your text is: Server u'192.168.2.23' not found in known_hosts
There are two steps to establishing an SSH connection. First you need to establish the connection and after that you present your credentials.
To avoid the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack. It is standard for ssh clients to keep track of the cryptographic fingerprint of the remote server and refuse to connect if either there's not already a fingerprint for that server or it is different on the local machine.
When doing this interactively you will typically prompt you to add a new key to the known_hosts file.
This answer has an example of what it will look like
The authenticity of host 'server-name (12.345.678.900)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is XXXXXXX.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

And the solution to your problem is to setup the known_hosts for target machine. Note that it's specific to the machine, the user, and I believe the specific protocol. (Aka roslaunch uses RSA by default which may not be the default for your command line ssh client anymore.
Make sure to test add the user of the machine. That's a common mistake when debugging.
There's also a very similar question here: A is not in your SSH known_hosts file. as a good reference.
