Q:

roslaunch error - "ERROR: cannot launch node of type"

When using a launch file in groovy catkin package, roslaunch reports an error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [nao_driver/nao_camera_both.py]: nao_driver
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/ludo/workspace/catkin_ws/install/share
ROS path [2]=/home/ludo/workspace/catkin_ws/install/stacks
ROS path [3]=/home/ludo/workspace/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [5]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

The contents of the launch file
<node pkg="nao_driver" type="nao_camera_both.py" name="nao_camera_both" required="true" args="--pip=$(arg nao_ip) --pport=$(arg nao_port) fps=5" output="screen">
        <param name="camera_switch" type="int" value="1"/>
        <param name="fps" type="int" value="1"/>
                <!--

                        k960p = 3                # 1280*960
                        k4VGA = 3                # 1280*960
                        kVGA = 2                 # 640*480
                        kQVGA = 1                # 320*240
                        kQQVGA = 0               # 160*120
        -->
        <param name="quality" type="int" value="3"/>
        <param name="topCamParams" type="string" value="package://morris_simulation/config/topCamCalibSim.yml"/>
        <param name="bottomCamParams" type="string" value="package://morris_simulation/config/bottomCamCalib.yml"/>
  </node>

rosrun nao_driver nao_camera_both.py works well though.

Hi,
I had a similar problem with a rosbuild package.
I was able to start the node via rosrun, but roslaunch wasn't able to launch my node, although the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH was set-up correctly. The launch-file worked already a few days ago.
I tried to locate my package with rospack find [packagename] and was able to find it at the assumed location.
I made a backup of the corrupted package, deleted it and created it again with roscreate-pkg in my workspace. After that I copied the old files (Source-Files, Manifest.xml, CMakeLists.txt) into the re-created package. Than I rosbuild the package and now everything seems to work again.
Cheers,
Georg

Thanks marvin! Actually regenerating the package made the difference. I could not find the factor that was making the difference. I had already tried erasing devel and install folders. Can someone explain how can regenerating the package make the difference?
