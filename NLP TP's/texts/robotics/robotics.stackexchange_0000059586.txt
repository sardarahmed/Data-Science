Q:

indigo actionlib client cannot connect to the server

I tried to make actionlib client/server program on ROS Indigo/Ubuntu 14.04,
but however, I've got a trouble that my actionlib client cannot connect to its server
because the "ActionClient::waitForActionServerToStart()" will be always failed.
And also, this problem occurred in the "actionlib_tutorial" in ROS Indigo
(ros-indigo-actionlib-tutorials).
By tracing the debug messages of ROS console,
I found that the actionlib server tries to make connection
but the client gets no response from status/feedback/result topics.

In the "/opt/ros/indigo/include/actionlib/action_client.h",
the function "ActionClient::statusCb()" was registered but never called at all.
so that, in the "actionlib/src/connection_monitor.cpp", the function "ConnectionMonitor::processStatus()" could not notify its condition.
then, in the "ConnectionMonitor::waitForActionServerToStart()", the variable "check_connection_condition_" has never success of its "timed_wait()".
in the result, ActionClient::waitForActionServerToStar() will be failed.

In ROS Groovy, my program and "actionlib_tutorial" have worked fine.
What should I do?
Thank you.

A:

How is actionlib installed? If you are using debs and not on ros-shadow, or your source is old, this is a bug in version 1.11.1  (https://github.com/ros/actionlib/issues/25) that prevented the conneciton monitor to work correctly. This is fixed in 1.11.2

Hello fergs. Thank you for your answer.
I installed actionlib and other ROS packages by apt-get from public ROS repositry "http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main".
Along your advice, when I checked the version of the actionlib, it shows that.

ros-indigo-actionlib  1.11.1-0trusty-20140509-0158-+0000
ros-indigo-actionlib-msgs 1.11.3-0trusty-20140508-2322-+0000

So far, today, the latest version which I can get from publich repositry is "1.11.1".
I'll wait for the new fixed version.
