Q:

No point cloud in Turtlebot Gazebo gmapping

I'm trying to follow this tutorial with Gazebo simulator:
http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/01/11/
In the tutorial, (real) Turtlebot is scanning the environment with Kinect point cloud. But when I run the examples in the turtlebot_gazebo package, it only scans with a fake laser. Probably because of this node, in the launch file of example:
https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator/blob/indigo/turtlebot_gazebo/launch/turtlebot_world.launch#L25
Anyway, how can I add the Kinect point cloud scan to that example?

A:

I think you can see the point cloud if you add PointCloud2 with the topic name: e.g. /camera/depth/points

Anyway without using script? I just wanted to see it in Rviz.

In RViz, you add a visualization by clicking the "add" button on the bottom left. A window will pop up, displaying different data types. Click "PointCloud2", hit "OK", and you will see a PointCloud2 on the left-hand side of RViz in the "Displays" area. Expand it, and then type the topic in.
