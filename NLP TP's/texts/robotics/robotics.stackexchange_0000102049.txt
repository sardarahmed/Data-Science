Q:

IMU sensor coordinates for EKF

Hi, I am using ekf to fuse multiple IMU. I was reading this portion
Measure +9.81 meters per second squared for the Z axis.
If the sensor is rolled +90 degrees (left side up), the acceleration should be +9.81 meters per second squared for the Y axis.
If the sensor is pitched +90 degrees (front side down), it should read -9.81 meters per second squared for the X axis.

1.Assume my robot is going 90 degrees vertically UPslope at 9.81m/s^2, my linear_accel.x will be 9.81x2? (gravity (+9.81) + forward acceleration (+9.81))?
2.Assume my robot is going 90 degrees vertically DOWNslope at 9.81m/s^2, my linear_accel.x will be 0? (gravity (-9.81) + forward acceleration (+9.81))?

A:

I believe the answer to (1) is yes. Some flight simulators tilt the users backward (so +X is facing up) to simulate forward acceleration.
(2) is trickier intuitively (at least for me), but that must still be correct.
But to test this, I have an IMU whose spec sheet shows its coordinate frames as such. It's right-handed with +Z facing up.

If I point the IMU such that +X is facing down into the ground, I get this:
linear_acceleration: 
  x: -10.0343017578125
  y: -0.4091726839542389
  z: -0.002991028130054474

Note that x is negative.
