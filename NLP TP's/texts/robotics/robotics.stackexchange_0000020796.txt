Q:

Implementation of a particle filter algorithm

How do you calculate the likelihood of making an observation ? 
Does someone have a link to a book or article that explains the math that you need to do to implement a PF algorithm? 
Conceptually i understand the implementation but I'm having a hard time updating the particles after a measurement update. Any resource that goes over the math in details/ with examples would really help. 

A:

"Probabilistic Robotics" by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, Dieter Fox is the book you are looking for.
