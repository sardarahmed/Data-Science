Q:

Running Gazebo results in Failed request: BadValue

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and ros Indigo. When I try running it, I get the following output:
X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
Major optcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)
Minor optcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
Value in failed request:  0x0
Serial number of failed request:  26
Current serial number in output stream:  27

I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Gazebo with no progress. Has anyone encountered something similar to this?

Could you please properly format your questions in the future? Use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it). For console copy-pastes, just select all text and click the button (or use ctrl+k).

A:

Are you running this in a VM? If yes: 3D accell and VMs are not a good match. If not: do you have proper 3D graphics drivers installed?

I'm sorry, I'm new here and didn't think to check for format standards.
In any case, gvdhoorn it's not a VM but I just got a closed-source nvidia driver that supports 3d acceleration and now it works! Thanks!
