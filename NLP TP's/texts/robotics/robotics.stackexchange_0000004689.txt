Q:

Short distance ball transport

I'm looking for a way to transport balls (diameter 50mm) 220 mm up with over a slope with a length of 120 mm. Currently I'm considering the usage of a belt system but I cannot seem to find a good belt system.
Because of space constraints within my robot, normally I would probably take a nylon belt and jam nails trough it to make little slots and then use that. However this would result in considerable reduction in available space as it means that I have to also take into account the extra space required for the nails on the way back. This means that ideally there would be a way to reduce the space used by the nails on the way back.
Does anybody have a good solution for this?

A:

If you wanna stick to the belt system, then cut circular holes into the belt with a diameter of ~30mm. The ball will not fall through and can be transported upwards.
if you don't need much control over the ball, then you can "shoot" it with air pressure or a mechanical construction; something like a racket .
If you have enough place at the beginning of the slope, you could use a pneumatic actuator to push the ball.
