Q:

Is it possible to modularize world files?

It would be useful if I could define kind of basic world in one file and then include this world file in other world files that would add different models and configuration to the simulation. Is there any way how to do that?

A:

There isn't yet a way to include a file into another through an <include> tag for example, just like it's done for models.
One thing which we've done in the past is to use embedded Ruby to generate world files from a template. This allows separating bits of the world into different templates, but the final generated world is always one.
You can see an example here. And here are instructions on how to get started with it.
