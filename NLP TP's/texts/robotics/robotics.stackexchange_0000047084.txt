Q:

Dropping connection on geometry_msgs::Transform

I am getting an error
[ERROR] [1357761577.273746553]: Client [/gazebo] wants topic /base_controller/command to have datatype/md5sum [geometry_msgs/Twist/9f195f881246fdfa2798d1d3eebca84a], but our version has [geometry_msgs/Transform/ac9eff44abf714214112b05d54a3cf9b]. Dropping connection.

when I initialize
vel_pub_ = n_.advertise<geometry_msgs::Transform>("cmd_vel", 1);

but if I do it
vel_pub_ =n_.advertise<geometry_msgs::Twist>("cmd_vel", 1);

it works fine ...
why cant I do Transform
NOTE: I am trying to work on Pr2 simulator Gazebo..

A:

The reason it crashes is simply because the topic you are publishing to is expecting a message of type geometry_msgs::Twist. So, that's the one to send. Simple as that!
