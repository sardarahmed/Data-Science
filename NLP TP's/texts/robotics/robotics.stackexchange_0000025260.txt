Q:

sonar sensor Gazebo-ROS

Hello Team,
I am using the plugin hector_gazebo_ros_sonar.so of the package hector_gazebo_plugins but the performance is very bad.
My problem is describe here: link:here
I am looking for another sensor which works a little better. Anybody know another sonar sensor plugin?
It is to do a study to explain the best position of these sonar sensors around the robot vs Kinect in some cases.
Thanks a lot.

Is the problem that the sonar values jump, and then slowly extend back to the ground plane?

Yes. The people of Hector fix the problem and it works very well now.
