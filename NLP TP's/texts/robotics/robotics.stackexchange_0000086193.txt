Q:

ROS - Turtlebot simulator problem: the turtlebot model does not appear on Gazebo

hi, i'm a beginner with ROS world.
I use Ubuntu 16.04 (on virtual machine), Kinetic, gazebo 7.
When i execute roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch, Gazebo starts and models of the 3D world appear, but there is no turtlebot model!
The terminal give me this error:
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/user/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache/index'
[spawn_turtlebot_model-3] process has died [pid 4179, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/gazebo_ros/spawn_model -unpause -urdf -param robot_description -model mobile_base __name:=spawn_turtlebot_model __log:=/home/user/.ros/log/62c9e862-31d6-11e8-b9a2-080027f2d824/spawn_turtlebot_model-3.log].
log file: /home/user/.ros/log/62c9e862-31d6-11e8-b9a2-080027f2d824/spawn_turtlebot_model-3*.log

I do not understand anything. How to solve?

A:

IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/user/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache/index'

you've ran sudo rosdep update at some point in the past.
You shouldn't do that (and you should also have been given a warning about that by rosdep).
Try the following and see whether things improve:
sudo rosdep fix-permissions
