A:

This is slightly difficult to answer, as you ask "will it run?", which is different from "is it supported?".
As to supported: no, Lunar is not supported on 18.04. See REP 3: Platforms by Distribution - Lunar Loggerhead, which shows that Lunar is only supported on 16.04, 16.10 (might not be the case any more) and 17.04.
('supported' in this case means that official binaries are made available and those are guaranteed to work on a specific OS)
As to "will it run": a from-source build (using the steps outlined in wiki/lunar/Installation/Source) may succeed, but there are no guarantees. There are many questions about building ROS from source on various OS, even newer and older Ubuntu versions. See #q277021 for an example.
Perhaps another board member can tell you more conclusively whether they've been able to build Lunar on 18.04 from source.

Note that ROS Melodic is / will be supported on 18.04: REP 3: Platforms by Distribution - Melodic Morenia.

And, as always: running ROS on any 'unsupported' OS is definitely possible with something like Docker. The OSRF supplies Docker images for just about every ROS release there is.

Ok thanks!
And is there any ROS distribution that is officially supported by Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04?

Well, I would say check REP-3. I linked you to it twice. That contains all the info you need.
