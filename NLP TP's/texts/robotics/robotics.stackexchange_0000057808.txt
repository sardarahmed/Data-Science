Q:

Dynamic Reconfigure - Can I Set An Array Of Values?

Hi,
I want to use dynamic_reconfigure in one of my nodes, however, one of my parameters is actually a variably-sized array of doubles. Can dynamic_reconfigure support variably-sized arrays, or does it only handle name-value pairs and structures?
Would a service with custom message type be a better solution for setting the array?
Thank you for your help.

A:

Know it's been a long time but:
You can't have an array of values, however, you can use a string with a comma deliminator between the values.
For example
gen.add("vals", str_t, 0, "A comma delimited list", "1,2,3,4")

later on you can break it into an array in your code. In python it's really ease, just use you_string.split(',')
