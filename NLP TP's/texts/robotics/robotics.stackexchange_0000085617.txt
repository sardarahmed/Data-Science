Q:

Number of faces on sphere Marker (RVIZ)

Hi there,
I'm wondering if there is some easy way to increase the number of faces plot on RVIZ when, as an example, displaying a visualization_msgs::Marker::SPHERE. I suspect that it's an Ogre issue rather an Rviz setting..
Have a look to this pic https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8648/15895679946_3e7e039afb_c.jpg

Any thoughts?
Bye, Augusto

Got it. The mesh is located under:
/opt/ros/kinetic/share/rviz/ogre_media/models/rviz_sphere.mesh 

or your cloned repository under the models folder and it is loaded from shape.cpp (github link)
The only issue is to create a new mesh, which can actually be done using Blender and some tools. I used:

blender-2.79a-linux-glibc219-x86_64 ; from blender, I've created the new sphere (just press the Create tab and then Sphere, then click F6 to change the number of "faces".  Then Export > Ogre3D (activate the add-on following the instructions of blender2ogre). Save the sphereHD.mesh.xml
blender2ogre blender2ogre (follow install instructions from the readme)
OgreXmlConverter only for windows :-( Use it to convert the sphereHD.mesh.xml to something that Ogre is able to use. Then "change the filename under shape.cpp and compile RVIZ again". Ok it's not the best solution I know, but that's a start :-)
