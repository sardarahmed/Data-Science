A:

It looks like your python packages are either out-of-date or missing dependencies.
Since it's referencing python modules in /usr/local/, I assume you've installed rosws through pip. If that isn't what you were expecting, you should probably try to uninstall the pip version.
My best guess is that you're missing the six library, and possibly other dependencies. I would try to run: sudo pip install -U rosws to get the latest version of rosws, and hopefully that will pull in the required dependencies as well. If it doesn't, you could try running sudo pip install six and see if that helps.

It sounds like your python installation is seriously broken. I suggest searching the internet for that error message or posting on one of the message boards for your linux distribution.
