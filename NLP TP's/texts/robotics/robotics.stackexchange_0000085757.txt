Q:

Cannot make ORB_SLAM2 work with TUM rosbag files

Dear all,
I am running ORB_SLAM2 on one of the ROS bag files from TUM benchmark datasets (rgbd_dataset_freiburg2_pioneer_slam.bag )
What I am seeing on Map Viewer is a increasing number of "blue camera" in the same position.
The Map Viewer is not showing any point cloud data...
ORB-SLAM2:Current Frame Window looks fine though. I see a bunch of ORB feature extracts/disappears as the frame changes. Besides, I confirmed that ORB-SLAM2 worked pretty well with the same dataset when ROS was not involved in. (just rgb + depth image sequence as input sequence) But, I have no luck with this rosbag file...
Can anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong here ?
My launch file is attached below
<launch>    
    <node name="RGBD" pkg="ORB_SLAM2" type="RGBD" output="screen" args="/home/hankm/OpenSW/ORB_SLAM2/Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt /home/hankm/OpenSW/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/RGB-D/TUM1.yaml">
    
        <remap from="camera/depth_registered/image_raw"     to="camera/depth/image"/>
        <remap from="camera/rgb/image_raw"                  to="camera/rgb/image_color"/>       
    </node>
</launch>

rosbag play rgbd_dataset_freiburg2_pioneer_slam.bag followed by the launch file above
