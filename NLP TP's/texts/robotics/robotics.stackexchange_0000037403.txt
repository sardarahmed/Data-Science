Q:

Quadrotor Path Planning with OMPL

I am trying to find a way to do 3D path planning for a quadrotor. This is a custom built quadrotor that will be controlled using mavlink (hopefully!) so not one of the ones already documented on this site. The only info I can find on 3d path planning seems to be for jointed arms on a fixed base (PR2 or similar). Is there any way I could use the 3D_navigation stack or even arm_navigation stack and adapt it for a quadrotor somehow? I have found a URDF quadrotor model in the asctec_drivers stack so was wondering if this would be useful at all.
I am using a kinect+RGBDSLAM to give a position estimate and an octomap of the surroundings. Ultimately I'd like to be able to visualise the quadcopter in RViz and set position goals, and for a collision free path to be planned.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe you know already this, but...recently prof. Roy et. al have been published a article about the Quadrotor planning. The paper calls "Polynomial Trajectory Planning for Quadrotor Flight" (I can't post links yet)

I m reading that paper and I find it very interesting. Did you know whether those  functions have been already implemented in ROS?
Thanks
