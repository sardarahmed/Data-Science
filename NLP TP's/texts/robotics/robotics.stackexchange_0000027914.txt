Q:

set gravity on each object Gazebo7

I am tryng to set the gravity on each individual objects in gazebo. I am spawning a robot model that needs to have 0 gravity. But The objects it needs to interact with need to have gravity,so they don't float away. I am not sure how to accomplish this I can turn on/off gravity for the entire world, but not individual models. Here is my world file,
    <?xml version="1.0" ?>
  <sdf version="1.4">
    <world name="default">
      
      <include>
        <uri>model://sun</uri>
      </include>

      <include>

        <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
      </include>
      
         <include>
        <pose>0 10 0 0 0 0</pose>
         <gravity>0 0 -9.81</gravity>
        <uri>model://button_panel</uri>
        
      </include>

      <gravity>0 0 0</gravity>
      
    </world>
  </sdf>

I would greatly appreciate any guidance.

lol i see u

A:

One should probably switch from disabling gravity, to making the robot static. It's still a temporary solution, but static is meant to be at the robot level, not world level. Having different gravity on different objects is a pretty bizarre request.
