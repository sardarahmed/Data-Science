Q:

Move_base usage

Hi,
I want to work with move_base package and I don't know how to achieve certain objectives.
I want to pause the pause the movement (given a goal I want to pause the movement until I receive a signal without forgetting the goal). By the time the signal is received, the robot shall continue its movement towards the goal.
Thank you

A:

you could use the actionlib and cancel the goal (instead of pause). to continue just send the same goal again.
