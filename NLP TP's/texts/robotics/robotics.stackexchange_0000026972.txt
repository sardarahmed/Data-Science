Q:

Detecting collisions without (very small) interfering with physical objects?

I would like to take advantage of the collision msgs by checking if some objects pass trough a given area.
I would create the area as an invisible link, with a collision that actually does not interfere with the other objects, but still knows when it collides with them. Is it possible to set up the parameters in such a way?
I could set the thickness of the object really small and the penetration depth larger, would that do it? Or it will skip collision detection?
I did not have the time to test this yet, I just wanted to know in advance if it is possible, so I will know where to start.
@hsu?
I will give an update in a while after trying this.
Cheers,
Andrei

I have a branch (collision_bitmask) started that will do what you are asking for. Let me look at it tomorrow to see where it stands.

it worked with the collide_without_contact tag, thanks

A:

We did something very similar to this with the MudPlugin (added in pull request 448). It uses a special sdf tag called collide_without_contact, though it only works in ODE right now. Take a look at that.
