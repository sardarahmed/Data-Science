Q:

3 degrees of freedom analytical solution

I have got a robot that exactly looks like as shown in the figure above. I have worked out the inverse kinematics analytical solution without the base rotation (considering 2 dof alone) but I am not able to find the analytical solution including the base(3 dof). How do I find the anlytical solution for this robot ?? 

A:

You can find many examples for this type of robot arm online.  It is kinematically similar to the first three joints of a Puma 560, which was used extensively as an example when robot kinematics and controls algorithms were being developed in academia.
