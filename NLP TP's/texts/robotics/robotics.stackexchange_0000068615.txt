Q:

How to change workspace and build environment?

I use ros-indigo and ubuntu 14.04. I install ros and create catkin. But now, I want to use rosbuild not catkin build. How can I do it? Should I add new package to ROS? Should I reinstall ROS?

A:

I think this tutorial still works with Indigo. It explains how to create a separate rosbuild workspace on top of catkin source packages.
Note that the converse, catkin on top of rosbuild, is not supported.
