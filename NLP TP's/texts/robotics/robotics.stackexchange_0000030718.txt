Q:

ROS natively on the iRobot Create Command Module

Hi,
Does anyone know if it's possible to run ROS natively (i.e. cross compiled) on the Command Module for iRobot Create?
thanks,
Nick

A:

There is not a native release of ROS for 8-bit platforms, so a native executable for the command module is not available.
It is highly unlikely that ROS will ever target a platform that constrained, since most of the focus is on higher-level research.
There are several libraries available for communicating with the iRobot from ROS though.  You can check out everything available on the Robots for ROS - Roomba Page.
