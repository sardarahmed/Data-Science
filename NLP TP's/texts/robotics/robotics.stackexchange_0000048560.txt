Q:

Does moveit work with a skid steer robot?

It looks like moveit is primarily for manipulator control.  Will it work to autonomously move a skid steer robot?
Does moveit replace move_base?

I don't think so.

Is that an answer to both questions?

A:

At this point we do not have move_base incorporated in moveit, but planning for ground vehicles is possible. However, this has not yet been integrated with execution of base motions.
