Q:

bag file request

I'm working on a project that requires collecting a large set of data; anything from a few hours to a week's worth of scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan) and tf (tf/tfMessage) topics, preferably recorded from the same environment (one floor of a university building, office, lab, etc). It's fine if people are present in the observed environment.
Before setting out to record the bag file(s) for this task, I thought I'd ask to see if anyone had already collected data similar to what I've described and would be willing to share it.
General requirements:

Bag file of recorded scan and tf topics.
Recorded in the same environment.
5hours + (the more data the better!).
People present in the environment is okay.

Thanks for the help!

A:

It seems like a bag-sharing website would be useful, doesn't it? A bit of a long shot, but you could try contacting  Frank Schneider, the organizer of Eurathlon, he has access to some nice datasets:
