Q:

laser_scan_matcher bulding package on Fuerte

I've successfully set up laser_scan_package on Electric. Now, I would like to build laser_scan_matcher package on Fuerte but I got the following error message:
 CSM previously patched, use make wipe to completely remove build directory.
 cd build/csm-git && mkdir -p deploy
 cd build/csm-git && cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/scan_tools/csm -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-fPIC"
-- Create a file named 'local_config/local-user-laptop.cmake' if you want to add options.
gsl home: 
DBG GSL_CONFIG GSL_CONFIG-NOTFOUND
FATAL_ERROR,FindGSL.cmake: gsl-config not found. Please set it manually.      
GSL_CONFIG=GSL_CONFIG-NOTFOUND
CMake Error at sm/CMakeLists.txt:30 (MESSAGE):
GSL not found.

How to solve the GSL problem. Thanks in advance.

@alfa_80
what is the command of installing  laser_scan_package on Fuerte ?

Last time I used, I've just checkout via git from the repository on ros.org. But now, when I was trying to search the link for you, it returns an error of ""laser_scan_matcher" is either not a ROS package or not yet indexed."  I think, it's yet to be indexed..wait until next Monday perhaps :-)

OK..thanks :)

@marwa: here is the command: "git clone https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/scan_tools.git", the laser_scan_matcher should reside in the scan_tools directory. Hope that helps..

Thank you :)

A:

Did you make sure you install all required dependencies first (e.g. via rosdep install)?
The quick fix would be to do apt-get install gsl0-dev and that would get you the required GSL dependency.

just a small correction> sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev

Thanks!  They must have their package set up slightly wrong or outdated because I ran rosdep install and it said that everything was there.
