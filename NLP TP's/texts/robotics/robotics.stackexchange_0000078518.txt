Q:

Install on Ubuntu 16.04 fails

Hello-
I'm trying to install ros-desktop-full and have tried several times ending in the same error. There are dependency problems reported as --configure fails for several sub-components. Here is the first encountered:
sudo apt-get install ros-desktop-full

.....OK so far...numerous packages downloaded and installed...
Setting up ros-kinetic-pcl-msgs (0.2.0-0xenial-20161026-182630-0700) ...
dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of ros-kinetic-pcl-conversions:
 ros-kinetic-pcl-conversions depends on libpcl-dev; however:
  Package libpcl-dev is not configured yet.
 ros-kinetic-pcl-conversions depends on libpcl1.7; however:
  Package libpcl1.7 is not configured yet.

dpkg: error processing package ros-kinetic-pcl-conversions (--configure):
 dependency problems - leaving unconfigured

....etc.
Then a string of similar failures where --configure fails

A:

You appear to be mixing debian upstream packages ros-desktop-full with OSRF hosted packages ros-kinetic-pcl-msgs It is not recommended to mix those.
