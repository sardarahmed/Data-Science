Q:

Rosbag and simulated time

Hello all,
I am trying to run a bag file if simulated time but I am not succeeding on it. Here is what happens:
After I run the bag file with the command
rosbag play --clock -l laser_scanner3.bag

I am checking the timestamp published  by the topic \clock, i.e. the simulated time, and the timestamp presented in another topic, which is not the same as the one from the \clock topic. I need to solve this dyssynchrony, because, otherwise, I will not be able to use the transformations from TF.
I know that this file were originally recorded with ORCA and after transformed in .bag format. Maybe, the issue is here.
Any guess on how I can solve this issue?
Thanks!

A:

The problem was related with a lack of sync between the several timetamps from the proper bagfile. The solution is well documented here!!!
