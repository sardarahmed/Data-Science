Q:

Hydro ROS installed from binaries and TurtleBOT installed from source

Hi Everyone,
I installed my hydro ROS from binaries and I need to install the Turtlebot from source (to access the source code for multiple turtlebot application)
Can Turtlebot from source installation run properly with hydro ROS from binaries, Debs installation? Do I have to install both from source ?
Thank you for any help in this matter.

A:

Yes, should be no problem mixing the two. And if there is, then the turtlebot sources need to be patched, updated and re-released.
