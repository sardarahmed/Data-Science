Q:

tf view_frames missing

I just did an install of the full desktop version of ROS Groovy as per the instructions on the install page. I just built a transform tree, and would like use the view_frames function in the tf package, but it's not there. Could I have missed installing it somehow?

A:

It turns out view_frames is still included in Groovy, but is in /opt/ros/groovy/bin so you can run it directly from the command line (assuming $PATH is set correctly). It seems this has happened with other packages. More info here: http://answers.ros.org/question/54132/pcl_ros-bag_to_pcd-not-found/
