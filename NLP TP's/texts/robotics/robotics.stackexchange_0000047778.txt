Q:

Problems with Installation of ROS-Groovy in Ubuntu 12.10

Dear all,
On a fresh install of ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal, there are unmet dependencies. I have verified that my sources.list.d file is properly set and updated.
I have been trying to search the root cause of this but it is not clear what I need to do.
This is what I get:
vmrguser@vmrg-xps-15:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
