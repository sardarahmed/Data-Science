Please post more information.  There is not enough information here to reproduce your effrots.  See http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support

Hi,
Fserver requires haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml to be in the same directory as you run the Fserver.
The file was missing in the package, but now It has been uploaded in the repository in the face_recognition directory.
Cheers,
Pouyan

No problem, I was just recommending a more general solution in a future release.

Jog, Thanks for your comments, will consider that for the future, but for now cmd works.
Comment by Pouyan on 2012-01-05:
When you use cmd="node", the working directory is face_recognition/bin. If you put the files in the bin directory, should be no problem.

I just tried it and i cant get it to work it shows a error when i use the directory if i use node or ROS_HOME  and put the file in those locations i get the file not found error

That is really not the recommended way to use roslaunch. I am not even sure it works. Have you tried it?
Comment by Pouyan on 2012-01-05:
As mentioned above,  the program searches for its input files in its working directory which is not necessarily the package directory. In 'roslaunch', you can set the working directory using 'cwd' attribute to point to the directory in which necessary input files are placed.
Comment by joq on 2012-01-05:
Depending on the current directory being the package directory is very unfriendly for people using roslaunch. Perhaps a future release might provide a more flexible access mechanism?

Running from the installation  directory was the key the server started and i was able to acquire a face  Thanks

You might also wish to put the data folder (containing sample pictures) and the train.txt file(which list the training examples) in the same directory. As all these are in the face_recognition directory by default, simply try : 1-roscd face_recognition 2-rosrun face_recognition Fserver
Comment by Pouyan on 2012-01-05:
rosmake in not necessary again. you should just run the Fserver from the directory in which haarcascade_frontface_alt.xml is placed. For example : 1- copy haarcascade_frontface_alt.xml to /home/new_dir 2-cd /home/new_dir 3-rosrun face_recognition Fserver.   Let me know if it works :)
