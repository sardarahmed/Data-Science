Q:

Why does a robot with navigation stack sometimes rotate in place

Hi, everyone.
I'm using nav stack and it works well.
However, sometimes a robot stops in its track and rotates in place.
It isn't a kind of recovery behavior.
And I think that it often occurs when I set maximum velocity to small value(eg. 0.1[m/s]).
What is the trigger for the rotation?
Thanks in advance.

As far as I remember it's one of the recovery behaviors. It happens when a robot cannot find feasible local path (control).

Thank you for your comment ! When I set maximum velocity to large value(eg. 0.3ï½ž1.0[m/s]), It works well and rotation doesn't often occur. So I think it's not a problem about local path...

A:

The rotate_recovery is indeed usually expected to be one of the two recovery behaviours. Unless you configured it else.
Are you sure there isn't another possible reason for it to rotate? You can visualize the global and local paths and obstacles etc in RViz to see if the current plan fails.

Thank you for your answer ! Global planner generates global path and it looks available. However, when maximum_velocity is very small, robot often rotates in place. I can't find another possible reason ...

Check via rostopic echo cmd_vel whether the robot is commanded to rotate in place or not and just cannot perform what the navigation wants it to do, e.g. a close curve, resulting in in-place-rotation. Which robot do you use?
