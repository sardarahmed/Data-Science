Q:

Make gazebo camera ignore certain objects

I have a robot model with a camera in gazebo. The camera is observing the world but some objects I would like the camera to ignore so they are not captured in the image output. Is it possible to have a gazebo camera ignore certain objects e.g. perceive them as transparent or black e.g. by giving the objects a specific prefix in their name or something else?
