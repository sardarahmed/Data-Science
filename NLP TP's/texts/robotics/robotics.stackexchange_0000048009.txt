Q:

How do I start gmapping with an initial map?

How do I give gmapping an initial map to start with?
My maps don't always turn out great, and it takes a long time to build them.  I'd like to be able to map part of the house, when that looks good, save that map, and start again from there.
(This tutorial shows how to use a known map for AMCL, but not as a starting point for gmapping).

Ah, but that gives me an idea.  You could patch two maps together with gimp to make one bigger map.
Comment by weiin on 2013-02-05:
yes, you can then use amcl to localise on that map.

Any gimp-like stuff is fine as long as the geometry stays intact. You could even correct the maps there.
