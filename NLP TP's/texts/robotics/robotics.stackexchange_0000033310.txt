Q:

rviz exception while loading: OGRE EXCEPTION(7:InternalErrorException)

Hi, I have been using rviz with no problems up until recently where upon using "rosrun rviz rviz" it begins loading and then promptly crashes and shuts down:
rosrun rviz rviz

INFO [1311775709.546537962]: Loading general config from [/home/ros/.rviz/config]

INFO [1311775709.546746875]: Loading display config from [/home/ros/.rviz/display_config]

ERROR [1311775712.566807201]: Caught exception while loading: OGRE EXCEPTION(7:InternalErrorException): Cannot create GL vertex buffer in GLHardwareVertexBuffer::GLHardwareVertexBuffer at /code/ros/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-1/RenderSystems/GL/src/OgreGLHardwareVertexBuffer.cpp (line 46)
Segmentation fault

I have tried cleaning and rebuilding it, but to no avail. I also haven't (knowingly) modified any files that are involved with rviz.
Any ideas?
Thanks!

What do you get in glxinfo? Did you recently (re-)install graphics drivers or a system update?
