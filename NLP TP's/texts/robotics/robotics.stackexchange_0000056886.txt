Q:

problem with dependency turtlebot_node

Hello,
I'm working with Groovy on Turtlebot (create base).
How could I add the dependency turtlebot_node to my package? I have done the following:
CMakeLists.txt of my package:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)   
project(beginner_tutorials)

## Find catkin macros and libraries
## if COMPONENTS list like find_package (catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS xyz)
## is used, also find other catkin packages
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs turtlebot_node)

Package.xml of my package :
<build_depend>turtlebot_node</build_depend>
<run_depend>turtlebot_node</run_depend>

However when I execute catkin_make in my catkin_ws,I have the following error:
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ cd ~/catkin_ws/

turtlebot@turtlebot:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make

Base path: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws

Source space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/src

Build space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/build

Devel space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/devel

Install space: /home/turtlebot/catkin_ws/install

CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):

Could not find a configuration file for package turtlebot_node.

Set turtlebot_node_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for turtlebot_node. The file will have one of the following names:

turtlebot_nodeConfig.cmake
turtlebot_node-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first): prueba/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! make: * [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1 Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

Can anyone help me please? I have no idea what is wrong with it.
I would appreciate any feedback.
Thanks in advance.

What are you trying to do exactly? I think that turtlebot_node is no longer used with groovy.

okk,thanks. I only want to probe a file that makes that turtlebot turn on groovy but I don't know it (the file is for electric and subcribes to turtlebot_node)

Try to check this: http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TurtleBot (choose groovy).

ok,thank you very much for everything

A:

It seems that catkin can't find turtlebot_node in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. In theory, you just need to make sure that turtlebot_node is installed (e.g. rospack list-names | grep turtlebot), and that your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH contains the path to turtlebot_node's install directory. You can check the current value of ROS_PACKAGE_PATH by typing:
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

To update it, just type:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/dir:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

However, in your case, it seems that turtlebot_node was removed with Groovy, so you should not even try to depend on it. For more information on turtlebot (which seems to be what you actually need), check the official documentation here and there.
Here is a similar problem.
