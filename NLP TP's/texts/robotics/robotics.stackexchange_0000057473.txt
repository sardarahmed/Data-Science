Q:

ros::init(â€¦) throws an error - Windows roscpp

I'm trying to use ros in cpp with Visual Studio 2012. I wrote the publisher and subscriber tutorial (http:// wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29) and first, I configure the project as says in the guide (http:// wiki.ros.org/win_ros/hydro/Msvc%20SDK%20Projects).
Then i compiled an linked the publisher, but when I tried to run it, ros::init(argc,argv,"talker") throws an exception... The console says that I ROS_MASTER_URI is not defined but I've got it defined
There are 2 images here: https:// www.dropbox.com/s/o12m0l38gaxiugi/error1.png - https:// www.dropbox.com/s/ocdmf0wj6rj0962/error.png
Can anyone helps me?
Thanks in advance

A:

in my case, I have used the system environment variable to export ROS_MASTER_URI
you can use windows system variable to set the variable ROS_MASTER_URI
open the environment variable setting windows ,
windows start -> control pane -> system -> advanced setting
click New button, and put ROS_MASTER_URI as variable name, and put the http://localhost:11311/ as its value.
and open the new DOS terminal, launch roscore.
roscore will be operated well.
good luck.
