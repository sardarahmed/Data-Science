Q:

rosbridge: command not found

When I try to run https://github.com/lgsvl/lanefollowing example, I get an error after execute "docker-compose up drive" Error: "rosbridge: command not found"
Is this a problem from ROS2 "dashing" or rather lgsvl docker?

A:

Almost definitely an issue with their docker image. It's a wild guess, but it seems quite plausible that this is related to their latest commit, and in particular this change.

Thanks. That's my guess too, I'll try to contact someone at LGSVL and when the problem is solved close this question.

Problem solved: build new docker with ros-dashing-desktop (there is noch version 0.7.3-1 for dashing)

I am having the same problem. Could you clarify how you built the new docker? I could not understand the comment in paranthesis.
