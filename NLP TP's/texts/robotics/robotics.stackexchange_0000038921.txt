Q:

install tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg package?

Hi,
I need help installing the "tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg" package or any of the stacks such as hector_slam, hector_mapping, etc within the package. I keep getting error: No Valid Packages or stacks listed as arguments. I used: rosdep install tu-darmsstadt-ros-pkg.
I would really appreciate for the help.

Im sorry for the late response. but thanks a lot! It worked. I was be able to install the hector_mapping.

A:

This is because we didn't do the necessary steps yet which are necessary to let our stacks get build and published as .debs via Willow Garage's build system. I'll have to check how that works, but with a major robotics competition coming up next week it'll probably be 2 weeks till I get to do it. You can always manually check out and build everything e.g. using
svn checkout http://tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg-read-only

Note that the path of this checked out working copy has to be inside the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH as described here.
After performing the above steps, you should the be able to build packages using for example
rosmake hector_mapping
