Thanks for your reply sincerely.
But I still have some question about this topic.
Follow this link: http://wiki.ros.org/sick_tim
There are 6 parts in it, my question are:
The first(Choosing the right branch) and second(Supported scanner types) parts are not problem for me
Comment by Terry Su on 2015-12-04:
Because I already installed the Jade ROS and my lidar is in the supported scanner types.
But in the the "Pack Summary", there is a "Source" with the link"git https://github.com/uos/sick_tim.git (branch: jade)", should I download it and put it somewhere in my computer?
Comment by Akif on 2015-12-04:
Choosing the branch is for source installation. Since you will install using debian package, skip this topic. We select the ROS distro with "-jade-" part in the package name I wrote. For the second topic, since you have TiM561, you will run sick_tim551_2050001 node.
Comment by Terry Su on 2015-12-04:
And in the third part(ROS API), there are 2 parts in it which are "Published Topics"  and "Parameters".
I click the links and see so much codes in it. Should I execute the codes in the Ubuntu's terminal?
Sorry for asking so much question, it would be very grateful for your reply.
Comment by Akif on 2015-12-04:
Did you go over tutorials? Topics are used for gathering scan data etc. Parameters are for configuration of your LIDAR and node. You will not execute codes for this. You will run the node with necessary parameters and get your scan data from /scan topic.

I read the tutorial these days. I use the command "git clone" to install the source from the package summary and I can see the some program is running, but it shows that USB can't be connected. (I use USB to connect to my com) I also change the port in the parameter, but I'm not sure is it right way
Comment by Akif on 2015-12-07:
You can supply these (command you run, error messages you get etc.) in detail by editing your question.

I reinstalled the Jade and sick_tim package summary source again. When I finished the installation, I go to the folder where is the sick package to find the tim_551 file(Path: sick_tim -> launch -> sick_tim_551_2050000.launch) to modify the IP and port number (by the gedit).
Comment by Terry Su on 2015-12-08:
In the launch, I modified the parameter which is for the IP and port  for my lidar shows as below:
param name="hostname" type="string" value="192.168.1.144"  and  param name="port" type="string" value="2111"

did you uncomment the  following line? https://github.com/uos/sick_tim/blob/indigo/launch/sick_tim551_2050001.launch#L22. Also you need to make your document public so we can see it.
Comment by Terry Su on 2015-12-08:
This is my sick_tim_561_2010101.launch code: https://github.com/TerryGP/sick_tim/blob/patch-1/launch/sick_tim_561_2050101.launch , I have already uncomment the part of TCP instead before, but it doen't work.
Comment by Terry Su on 2015-12-09:
These are the all the file of my sick folder in this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6iIqQqNZmCQZmVBeU92aWFVdVU . I am a beginner of Github, therefore I can't make a same folder as you send to me in a short time. I use google cloud disk instead of it. But I will make a one in the future.
