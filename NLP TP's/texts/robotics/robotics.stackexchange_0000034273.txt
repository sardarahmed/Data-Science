Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Ros serial

Hi All
I am trying to run the Time and TF tutorial but i get the following error
TimeTF.cpp: In function ‘void loop()’: 
TimeTF:25: error: invalid conversion from ‘char*’ to ‘unsigned char*’
TimeTF:26: error: invalid conversion from ‘char*’ to ‘unsigned char*’ 
TimeTF:32: error: ‘class ros::NodeHandle’ has no member named ‘now’

I'm using ros_electric ubuntu 10.4 32 bit aurdino uno and aurdino 22
the other examples work fine

Hi Peter,
I think that the problem is that the electric release is actually an older version of rosserial.  We broke that API a little while ago and updated the documentation on the website to reflect newest code.  Could you try pulling rosserial from the repo and using it?
Just do :
hg clone  https://kforge.ros.org/rosserial/hg rosserial
