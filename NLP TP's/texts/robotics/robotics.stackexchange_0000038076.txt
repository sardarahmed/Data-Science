Q:

namespace renaming

I have the turtlesim node running at /ajsim/turtle1
It is subscribing to the topic /ajsim/turtle1/command_velocity
I started another node called turtle_teleop_key which publishes the topic /turtle1/command_velocity
The problem is that the node in /ajsim/turtle1 cannot subscribe to the topic at /turtle1/command_velocity
I tried the command,
[code]
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key command_velocity:=ajsim/turtle1/command_velocity
[/code]
but it doesn't work and the wiki is a little unclear about how the change the namespace. Could someone please tell me how I can make sure they are in the same namespace?

A:

Have a look at this tutorial.
You could also use:
export ROS_NAMESPACE=/ajsim
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

This would run the teleop node under the ajsim namespace, and would allow you to subscribe to the topic.
EDIT:
I do not know of a way to change a node's namespace while it's running. If you don't want to use the ROS_NAMESPACE variable, then you would want to use roslaunch.

thank you. That worked. I was wondering if there is a way to change the namespace of a node while it is executing... so that it can continue publishing the messages in the new namespace?

To change the namespace while a node is running?
Comment by cassander on 2012-02-22:
Yes.. is it possible to change the namespace of a node while it is running? If that is not possible, then is it possible to change the namespace of a node while it is being launched on the command line using rosrun without having the export the ROS_NAMESPACE variable?
