Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: install stack

Hi!! I am working with this robot:
Robotnik Summit
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/Summit

and I want to learn more possibilities with ROS.
The fact is, I am using ROS-FUERTE and Ubuntu 11.10 and I am not capable to install this stack:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/summit_description

Which the svn is:
http://summit-ros-stack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/trunk/summit_sim/summit_description

And I want to include in my stacks /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
with this comand:
$ cd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
$ git clone http://summit-ros-stack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/trunk/summit_sim/summit_description

But the return is:
Cloning into summit_description...
fatal: http://summit-ros-stack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/trunk/summit_sim/summit_description/info/refs not found: did you run git update-server-info on the server?

It is my first time trying to install one stack by my own and I don't know how to do it.
I usually do it this way:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-electric-erratic-robot

For example but this erratic robot is not available in Fuerte yet and I regret neither the robotnik.
I download manually the trunk and now, I don't know what must I do to install in ros/fuerte/stacks
Can anybody help me with both installations?

A:

You seem to be trying to check out an svn repository using git. Instead of git clone, use
svn co http://summit-ros-stack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/trunk/summit_sim/summit_description
