Q:

Math functions for geometry_msgs?

Hi all,
What is the best practice for doing simple math operations such as 'calculating 3D euclidian distance between two geometry_msgs::Points'?
I found a Linearmath folder in the 'tf' include for vectors, but did not find any related documentation.

A:

If it is really simple (like your example): Do it by hand, i.e. hypot(p1.x - p2.x,...).
If it is a little more advanced, or you might do more than 1 simple calculation: Convert the messages (which are just 'dumb' containers for data) to their respective tf data types. There are conversion functions like tf::pointMsgToTF for converting forth and back. The tf data types have all the geometry operations you'd expect for linear math.

Also note that the geometry stack includes nice functions for getting tf data into Eigen and KDL types.  This can be useful if you need more complex math operations.
