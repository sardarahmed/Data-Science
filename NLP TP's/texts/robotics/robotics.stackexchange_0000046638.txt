Q:

custom rosdep rules

I am migrating to fuerte and I am having problem with rosdep 2. We have a bunch of packages and we used to have a bunch of rosdep rules to support our packages. I am wondering what I am supposed to do with rosdep2?
I tried creating /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/30-myrosdep.list with a line such as: "yaml file://path/to/my/rosdep.yaml", but it was rejected.

Hi Brice,
the URI needs a hostname, so it should look like this:
file://localhost/home/martin/code/rosdistro/rosdep/base.yaml

The instructions from the official documentation tell you to first push to your forked github repo and then directly use your github links, but I prefer testing my rules locally (using a set of rules like the one above) before pushing to github.
You should still create a github account, fork the repository etc. (as explained in the page I linked to) and edit the forked files. Your sources.list.d entry should point to those files. That way, when you're satisfied, you can submit a pull request so everybody can use your rosdep rules.

It might also be a good idea to check if there already is a rule in rosdep. I found many packages actually already in there.

An additional slash should also work: file:///home/martin/code/rosdistro/rosdep/base.yaml.

@joq: It should, but it doesn't. Rosdep insists on a hostname even for file:// schemes; this is a bug in rosdep.
