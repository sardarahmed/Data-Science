Q:

How to add ROS to path in VS Code?

Hello,
Is anyone using VS Code to program in ROS? I kind of like this IDE ( haven't used it earlier ) and want to use it as it comes with a lot of features which I like.
My question is when I include <ros/ros.h> it puts a green squiggle below it, and also for service file generated headers it can't really locate them. Any suggestions on how to add on to the path to avoid this.
To be noted, there is no problem in building it as it is already in the path of Linux terminal...

There isn't a section for VS Code on the ROS IDE wiki, but the instructions for one of the other IDEs might provide some hints.

A:

The IDE wiki now includes an entry for VSCode, which points to a ROS extension. Among other things, this extension will add the appropriate include paths. I tried this and it works nicely.

If the task provided by the VSCode ROS extension does not work (in my experience that feature is brittle), you might find this answer helpful.
