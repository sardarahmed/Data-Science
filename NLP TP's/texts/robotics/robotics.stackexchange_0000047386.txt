Q:

A question in catkin concepts

I am confusing when I read the following part of Catkin Concepts
"A <run_depend> entry will define any dependency that a 3rd package using our new package needs to also have in the environment. This can happen for libraries at runtime, or for headers at build-time of the 3rd package. So "run" in <run_depend> can be slightly misleading. When a debian package is created, it should make sure that all <run_depend> dependencies are also installed by apt-get."
What does it mean a 3rd package?
What I understand about <run_depend> is that it specifies executables or files this new package depends on during run-time. Is it right?

A:

Assume you build a package like beginner_tutorial. This depends on package roscpp.
This means roscpp is the first package, beginner_tutorial the second.
Now somebody else wants to create another package, additional_stuff, on top of beginner_tutorial. That would be a third package in our dependency chain.
If additional_stuff would also need roscpp to depend on beginner_tutorial, then beginner_tutorial should declare this, so that additional_stuff does not need to declare it as well.
This is not just about run-time, it is about build time of the 3rd package.
E.g. if in beginner_tutorial you create a public c++ header that includes stuff from ros.h (from roscpp), then additional_stuff would need to know where to get ros.h.
So this is not exactly run time.
