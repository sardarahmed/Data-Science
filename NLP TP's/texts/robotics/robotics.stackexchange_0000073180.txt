Q:

Creating world file for Gazebo with xacro

I'm trying to generate random boxes in a world file for Gazebo simulator. I know how to create a model sdf, and how to include it from the world file.
Now I want to create different sizes of boxes in the world file using xacro and width/height parameters.
I can't get it work. Please help :)

Do you want to place models randomly? Or Do you want to place models with different sizes in world? What should be randomly size, position or both?

Hi, tnx for responding.
Right now, my world file using multiple times  tag to include my object model (in the model the size is fixed to 1x1 and the position isn't determined) and adds  tag for each.
I'd like to be able to pass the "size" as a parameter to the included object.

A:

I think it would be right in your case to use  tag. Pls, look at this tutorial . There exist random distribution of positions. Also, you can fix a size, but the size will be common size of N models, which you point in <model_count> tag.
"I'd like to be able to pass the "size" as a parameter to the included object" ----   In case, you want to put models with different size, I guess  tag will be not appropriate for that ..

Thanks for that.
What if i have a different situation:
I have a list of predetermined "size"s and "pose"s, and I want to generate world file includes them. I want the file to be as clean as possible,  so I want to use single model file and include it many times and only specify size/pose for each?

 tag is not for this case.. Maybe, you are on right way to use multiple times .. I cant be sure, because I dont know another solution.. Sorry :)

Ty. and is there a way to pass the "size" and "pose" as parameters in the include tag?
Comment by dyupleks on 2016-04-04:
You can use  tag inside of .
I never note the  tag in . Look at this SDF specification . You can find all documentation about a tag and be sure what to use inside one..

The question "How to fix size of a model" is not answered for me too. Before, I changed it by SketchUp Make, but there must be a way to fix size in Gazebo too..

I hope there is a way to do it using xacro :)
