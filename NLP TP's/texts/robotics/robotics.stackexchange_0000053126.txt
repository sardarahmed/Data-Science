Q:

Unable to communicate with ardrone using ardrone_automation

Hi,
Im trying to unravel the problem I have with communicating with the ardrone using  ardrone_automation.
I have the ardone connected via wifi and it is visable, no ethernet connected. I have had the ardone running on this computer previously using another application (closed long ago). Drone is on and connected via wifi.
When I try to communicate I get:
nigel@nigel-Satellite-P100:~$ rosnode list
ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!
I have installed all the program as per your instructions and when I go to run it I get the following problem:
nigel@nigel-Satellite-P100:~$ rosrun ardrone_autonomy ardrone_driver
Wait authentification

===================+> 192.168.1.1
[ERROR] [1375096491.668394796]: [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at [localhost:11311].  Retrying...
This is my hosts file:
127.0.0.1    localhost
127.0.1.1    nigel-Satellite-P100
The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
I think I made it worse using:
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://'localhost:11311' ('added so as not to post link')
Please help !
Answer:
I found the problem was I did not have a launch file which included roscore
