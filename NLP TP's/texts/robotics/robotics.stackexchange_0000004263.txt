Q:

Visibility Graph Toolbox for Python

I'm searching for a python toolbox/library to do visibility graph based motion planning. I have searched on the internet, but couldn't find anything. I'm probably missing out...
Is there any package, you can recommend me?

A:

The VisiLibity implementation appears to have python bindings.
