Q:

Cmake cannot find package for dji onboard sdk file

Hi
I was using dji onboard SDK for develop and meet problems about include sdk file into my project.
I put several project in one workspace,

After i 'catkin_make' it, it shows error,
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dji_sdk" with any
  of the following names:

    dji_sdkConfig.cmake
    dji_sdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dji_sdk" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "dji_sdk_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "dji_sdk" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  meteorOnboard/fcu/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package)

-- Could not find the required component 'dji_sdk'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.

Any advice appreciated.

Hi, Glen. I'm having some similar trouble. Did you find any solution to your problem? I'd love to hear about it.

A:

Hi there,
I had the same problem, and I could fix it.
I had this:
*Call Stack (most recent call first):
 foobar/CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package)*

So I deleted the folder foobar, I guess that the problem was for something that it was active or who knows... (I'm a beginner)
When I deleted it ( user@name:~$ rm -R catkin_ws/src/foobar ), then it worked.
In your case says:
*Call Stack (most recent call first):
 meteorOnboard/fcu/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package)* 

So the problem is in the CMakeLists.txt of the folder fcu.
Also:
*Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dji_sdk" with any...*

Make sure that you install the dji_sdk . Clone it: user@name:~$ git clone https://github.com/dji-sdk/Onboard-SDK.git
I dont' know if it would help you, actually I'm not really sure how I fix mine  ^^'
