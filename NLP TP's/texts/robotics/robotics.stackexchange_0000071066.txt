Q:

Can't install kobuki

I go through this tutorial. In 2.3.2 I run this command:
 wstool init src -j5 https://raw.github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_tools/master/rosinstalls/indigo/kobuki.rosinstall
I have an error:

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/yujinrobot/yocs_msgs.git/': gnutls_handshake() failed: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.
Exception caught during install: Error processing 'yocs_msgs' : [yocs_msgs] Checkout of https://github.com/yujinrobot/yocs_msgs.git version indigo into /home/nadya/kobuki/src/yocs_msgs failed.

ERROR in config: Error processing 'yocs_msgs' : [yocs_msgs] Checkout of https://github.com/yujinrobot/yocs_msgs.git version indigo into /home/nadya/kobuki/src/yocs_msgs failed.
How can I solve this problem?

A:

This looks like a problem with github's service. I suspect that if you try again it will work.
