Q:

move_base is not working properly

[ WARN] [1588520680.083051590, 74.492000000]: Control loop missed its desired rate of 10.0000Hz... the loop actually took 0.3410 seconds

[ WARN] [1588520680.082264978, 74.492000000]: Map update loop missed its desired rate of 10.0000Hz... the loop actually took 0.3410 seconds

why do I get this error when I'm launching move_base
when I'm launching the same move_base for turtlebot then there's no error

A:

I solved the problem by reducing the frequency from 10 to 3 now it's working perfectly fine.
