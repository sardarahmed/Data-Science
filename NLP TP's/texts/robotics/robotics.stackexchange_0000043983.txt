Q:

Does anyone have a Toshiba Thrive or similar tablet AVD for development in Eclipse?

I'm going to implement rosjava on a Toshiba Thrive and would love to be able to emulate the thrive in Eclipse. Does anyone know how to best accomplish this? I ask because all the Android tutorials and web searches I've done in trying to find out how to set up the AVD for a tablet PC has not been very successful.

A:

While you are trying to use rosjava, this isn't really a question about ROS. I'd suggest asking this question on an Android development forum.
