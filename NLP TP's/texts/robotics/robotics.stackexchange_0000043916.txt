Q:

How to solve 'No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch'?

I use ubuntu 12.04 with fuerte.
I followed rgbdslam.
When I run rgbdslam,it shows the error:
  sam@sam:/media/Data/code/ros/slam/rgbdslam$ roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch 
  ... logging to /home/sam/.ros/log/07543c9e-f807-11e1-8779-20cf30a23845/roslaunch-sam-21581.log
  Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
  Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
  Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.
  
  while processing /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch:
  Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/launch/openni_node.launch'
  sam@sam:/media/Data/code/ros/slam/rgbdslam$                                                                  

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

I get rgbdslam to work as follows
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam

The topics that are necessary for rgbdslam node are published by openni.launch file. Just don't use kinect+rgbdslam. This has been working for me
