Q:

Distance measurements and tf

Hi everyone,
I monitor a small robot with a number of external distance sensors. The sensors are implemented as ROS nodes publishing their results. Now I want to integrate a mechanism that allows a transformation of the measurements related to a known position of the sensor. Short
Distance measurements + Sensor Position = correct representation in the world
I guess their exists a solution for this problem in ROS?
Best wishes from Germany

A:

Best way is probably to use URDF and robot_state_publisher to define and publish your robot description, including sensor location, to tf.
Then, if you publish your sensor data using one of the message types with a built-in rviz display (e.g. sensor_msgs/Range) you will be able to easily visualize it on 3D.

There's also a Range datatype defined in sensor_msgs http://www.ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Range.html for which there are rviz visualizers in the nxt packages and soon will be built into rviz.
