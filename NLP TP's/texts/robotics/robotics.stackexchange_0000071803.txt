Q:

Unable to locate package ros-groovy-openni2-launch

i'm trying to install and use my Xtion camera with Ubuntu 12.04 ROS Groovy.  This is a fresh install.
I should be install the openni2 package using
sudo apt-get install -f ros-groovy-openni2-launch ... right?
But, I'm getting this message
Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done   E: Unable to locate package ros-groovy-openni2-launch enter code here
I've attempted installing following the directions here: http://answers.ros.org/question/190377/how-to-setup-xtion-pro-live-ubuntu-1404-openni12/ by replacing 'hydra' with 'groovy'. No luck.
Any ideas would be appreciated.

No, as according to debbuild/groovy.html?q=openni, that particular package was never released into Groovy. Only the openni2_camera package was (see the deb on packages.ros.org here fi). The wiki page also shows this: notice the Released, Continuous integration and Documented badges on the Hydro, Indigo and Jade pages, but only the Documented one on the Groovy page.
As to options: you could try to see whether you can build the package from source in a Groovy catkin workspace. Probably best to checkout the groovy-devel branch. It's just a set of launch files, so it could work.
Alternatively, try to build all openni2 packages from source, using the hydro-devel branch. That will probably be a bit more involved, as things might have changed between Groovy and Hydro in an incompatible way.

Ok.
What's not so fun is that I'm also having trouble with the Asus Xtion and openni2 in Hydro.  I'm getting this error: [ERROR] [140934478.275581907]: Unsupported color video mode - Resolution: 640x480 30Hz Format:RGB888 ...
basically what this guy is seeing: answers.ros.org/question/191498/

But, since I don't want to upgrade to Indigo at this time... I'm going to keep looking (and post another thread)

I'm afraid I can't help you with the Xtion issue. Opening a new question would seem to be a good idea, yes.
