Q:

RL exception in launching moveIt

I am trying to launch jaco arm in moveit using the command
roslaunch j2n6s300_moveit_config j2n6s300_jaco_lfd.launch

but getting this error
RLException: [j2n6s300_jaco_lfd.launch] is neither a launch file in package [j2n6s300_moveit_config] nor is [j2n6s300_moveit_config] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
akashleena@akashleena-Latitude-3490:~/catkin_ws/src/jaco_con

I have already done source devel/setup.bash still getting the error. Please help

A:

Did you  check if your package "j2n6s300_moveit_config" has a launch file "j2n6s300_jaco_lfd.launch" ?
