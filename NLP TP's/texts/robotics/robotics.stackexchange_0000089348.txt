Q:

ROS Kinetic on Raspbian Stretch E:Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-freenect-launch E:Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan

I am planning to work on using the Kinect for map building and obstacle avoidance. I have installed ROS-Kinetic successfully by following this ROS wiki installation. I am following this installation guide to install Kinect with ROS Kinetic. When I try these commands:
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-freenect-launch 
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan

I get the following error:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E:Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-freenect-launch

Can someone help me solve the issue?

A:

The installation tutorial you link to installs ROS from sources. That means that you download the sources for the relevant packages and then compile them on your target (in this case an RPi).
You cannot later mix that with binary packages that you install with apt.
Starting from source means that you'll have to build every pkg you want to use later from source as well.
Refer to the Maintaining a Source Checkout on the same page to see how you can do that.

Can I clone a source into src folder in workspace and catkin_make in this situation, I mean in the instruction if  I want to install any package I have to list it in this command: rosinstall_generator ros_comm ros_control joystick_drivers --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
But if the package I want to install only available in source??
