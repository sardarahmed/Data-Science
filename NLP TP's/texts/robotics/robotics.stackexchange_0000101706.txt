Q:

How to report ROS 1 wiki issue?

Step 1.3 in the installation procedure at https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Debian fails, apparently because the key server at ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net is offline:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
Executing: /tmp/apt-key-gpghome.b7Cz6OV1QZ/gpg.1.sh --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
gpg: keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure

(edit): I resolved the issue by doing this instead:
sudo -E apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654

My real questions is: how do I file an issue (and possibly contribute) for this? There doesn't appear to be a link on that wiki page for submitting doc error reports.

I've updated the title of your post.

And a related / duplicate question: #q222114.
Summarising: as the ROS 1 wiki is a wiki, the typical procedure would be to register for an account and fix the page you believe needs fixing.
The key server being down / flaky has been a problem before (see ros-infrastructure/roswiki#140 for a (really) old ticket about it, and #q223702 for (one) previous Q&A about it).
I remember @tfoote dealing with something similar recently, but can't find it.
Perhaps he can provide some input.

Thanks, I finally noticed the "login" link at the bottom of the wiki page. I'll give that a shot. TBH, I'm a little reluctant to offer advice on a page that's so fundamental. I'm sure there are security implications here that I don't fully understand.

A:

Answering my own question: instructions for editing a ROS wiki page found here: http://wiki.ros.org/EditingTheWiki#How_to_Edit_a_ROS_Wiki_Page
P.S. Following gvdhoorn's advice (above), I updated the Debian installation instructions with the keyserver that worked for me, as of May 2022: hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80.
