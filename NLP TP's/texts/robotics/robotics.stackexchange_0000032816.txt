Q:

Using service to communicate between nodes in different package

Hi all,
The tutorial gives an example of communication between nodes in the same package. Is it possible to use service to communicate between nodes in different package? Does that mean I should load two manifests?
Thanks!

A:

Yes, it is definitely possible.
You just define the service in any package (e.g. package A) and make package A a dependency for the packages using the service.
Of course, a package can use its own service, too.
This question is the same in principle (just for messages):
