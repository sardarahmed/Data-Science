Q:

.bashrc doesn't work to source my workspace

Hi,I have written to the .bashrc to source my workspace ,but some of them don't be sourced by the .bashrc(some can).I don't know why.I use ubuntu 14.04 and x64 ,ros indigo.here is my .bashrc,where is the errors?

Could you please format file contents (code, launch files, configuration files, etc) using the Preformatted Text button next time? It's the one with 101010 on it. Thanks.

ok,I am newer,so I just copy ,I will do as you say next time ~

A:

Note that sourcing a setup.bash file overwrites any environment variables that were set through a previous "sourcing" of a setup.bash file. At the bottom of your bashrc, you source 4 workspace setup.bash files, and one from the Indigo install, but the only source command that has any lasting effect is the last one. So the environment you see should only have the /home/robot3/test2 workspace active.
If you need all of these workspaces active at the same time, you should either merge them to make one workspace, or read about workspace chaining. Unless you have a good reason to have all of these workspaces, I'd recommend just merging them.
