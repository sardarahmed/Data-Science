Q:

Trouble installing nmea_navsat_driver package?

Hello, I'm currently trying to set up a GPS receiver and base station my boss purchased to work in ROS. It is a trimble Ag GPS 542 GNSS receiver ( http://ssmgps.com/pdf/AGPB_AgGPS542_B... ). It looks like the deivce can work in NMEA-0183 sentences, and thus that it should be compatible with the nmea_navsat_driver ROS package, found here: http://wiki.ros.org/nmea_navsat_driver , but I am encountering some installation issues.
I have extracted the package into my catkin_ws/src directory using
 git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver

Then I run catkin_make, and get the following response:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package roslint.
Set roslint_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for
roslint.  The file will have one of the following names:
roslintConfig.cmake
roslint-config.cmake
Call Stack (most recent call first):
nmea_navsat_driver/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)
CMake Error at nmea_navsat_driver/CMakeLists.txt:23 (roslint_python):
Unknown CMake command "roslint_python".
I don't know what roslint_DIR is, and can't find anything about it online, but I did try searching my computer for both roslintConfig.cmake and roslint-config.cmake (no results for either).  Anyone know what could be going wrong/how to fix it?

I'm not sure if I modified everything I should have from your example, but I tried
rosdep install --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
And it told me "ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
toro: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [ncurses++]" Ncurses is something I'm using in another executable in the same project (that I don't care about anymore).  I tried commenting out the CMakeLists reference to that executable, but it didn't change the error.

another option is to create another worskpace and clone only the gps driver there. Can you try that?

Alright, made a catkin_ws2 right next to the first one (had to check out the ros tutorials again).  Then I added the path to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, cloned  it into the src directory, and catkin_made.  Unfortunately, I get exactly the same error.

Actually I get what you mean now.  I ran the rosdep install line in my catkin_ws2 and it worked.  Now catkin_make builds successfully and I can run the executable!  So what exactly did that line do? I don't understand the --from-paths src and --ignore-src parts.

you can read what they mean in the installation guide from source for indigo (section 2.1.2).

Ok, thanks!

A:

did you tried checking the dependencies before catkin_make? for example,
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y
another option is to create another worskpace and clone only the gps driver there.
EDIT: Added second part from the comments.

Initialized a second catkin_ws, git cloned the package into the src directory, and ran the suggested line in it:
rosdep install --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y
Then catkin built and the installation is complete.
