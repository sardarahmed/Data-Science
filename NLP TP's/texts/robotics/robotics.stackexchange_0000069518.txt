Q:

Docker images for armhf

Hi - I'm really excited to see the ROS Docker images! https://hub.docker.com/u/osrf/
The ROS images are currently based on the x86 ubuntu:trusty image. I see there's an osrf/ubuntu_armhf image, but are there any plans to provide ROS images that are armhf-based, in addition to x86?
I'm really interested in running ROS in Docker containers on Beaglebone Black, but need armhf-based images to do that.
Thanks,
Zach

A:

We would like to make them available. However we're using the dockerhub automated builds for easy of use and transparency, and the dockerhub servers do not support the armhf builds.  When and if dockerhub supports armhf we will plan to turn them on.
PS: We also have ROS images in the ros organization on dockerhub too.

That makes total sense, I hope they add armhf support soon. In the meantime, is it possible to build the ROS Docker images for armhf on our own infrastructure? Has anyone successfully built the images for armhf?

Sure, we use them all the time for the armhf buildfarm. You can make your own, just replace the FROM line with osrf/ubuntu_armhf in any Dockerfile which uses the default ubuntu base image.

I believe these guys found a workaround that would allow us to build ARM containers on DockerHub: https://resin.io/blog/building-arm-containers-on-any-x86-machine-even-dockerhub
