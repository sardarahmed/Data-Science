Q:

Why are search engines (Google, Bing) returning ROS wiki mirror search results instead of results for the main site?

I've noticed that when I google something, e.g. "roslaunch machine tag", that the results that typically show up for the wiki pages are from the UMD mirror of the wiki rather than the wiki itself. I'm not sure when this started happening but it definitely didn't happen before, as this has always been my (admittedly somewhat lazy) way to access the documentation.
Did something change on the server side of the (real) wiki that is making Google avoid it in search results? It might not just be Google, either--I'm having trouble getting Bing to return any ros.org wiki results either..

Seems like it's been doing that for a long time.

Yeah, it might not be a recent thing, just I've been doing a bit more ROS related Googling lately. Either way, still annoying. :)

A:

Perhaps the maintainers can add a canonical link element to the wiki pages to point at ROS.org.
