Q:

Turtlebot sensor defective or fine?

Hello,
I have a Turtlebot (create base) and it' very difficult to localize it because sensors seems pretty bad. I would like to know if my Turtlebot or my data are fine or if there is a problem somewhere.
First, I cannot use directly JointState because the robot publishes always zero values. This is working only in gazebo simulation but not on the real robot. Is there some parameters to set ?
Secondly, odom sends me a angular velocity null when my robot is moving slowly even through wheels are moving (no slipping !). Encoder are on the wheel so it should be send me a velocity even with bad encoder. Does my robot encoders are defective ?
Thirdly, imu is moving itself when robot is stationary. I agree that is common for imu in position because it's a integration but I have also a velocity non null and bad results with.
I have done calibration for imu and odom, I can understand that sensors are not hight quality but what I see it's too much important to work fine. I see a lot of great videos with Turtlebot so I was wondered if these errors are normal or not.

This: http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/Navigation%20Tuning%20Guide#Is_the_robot_navigation_ready.3F is a good test, especially section 2.2.

I made my own tests similar to those. The result is very bad all the time. Error on orientation has a bigger impact on the position of course.
Is it possible that encoders have a low pass filter ?
