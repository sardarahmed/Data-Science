Hi,
I have calibration file for both RGB and IR camera. However, i'm still getting the Camera calibration file xxx not found. even though the xxx is the correct path?

could you tell me how to solve the problem "Camera calibration file XXX not found"?
Comment by Stephane.M on 2013-06-05:
You should never ask a question as an answer to another question.
However, please not that the "error" Camera calibration file not found is not a problem, as default camera calibrations files exist, and programs work without further calibrations from users.
