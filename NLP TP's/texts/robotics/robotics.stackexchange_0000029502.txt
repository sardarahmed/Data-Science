Q:

Is ROS still looking at using Qt?

A while ago there was a discussion of moving from wxWidgets to Qt and PySide:
Moving from wxWidgets to Qt
How does ROS community feel about Qt in light of recent Nokia-Microsoft partnership announcement?
Qt group did provide an update yesterday:
Update on Qt
PySide also seems to be unaffected:
Turmoil at Nokia -- no immediate effect on PySide

A:

If there is any affect on Qt, it would mostly seem related to the mobile space.  Qt already has a large userbase and demand in the desktop space, so I don't see much affect.  Relative to wxWindows, Qt still seems the better choice.

Alex is working on transitioning some of our existing tools (xdot, rxgraph, smach_viewer) to qt.  Future tools will be built in Qt.  There is no particular schedule for the overall transition, but we are soliciting help with 'handoff' tickets for those willing to assist.

The main question, "Is ROS still looking at using Qt?" still isn't really answered. What's the status of plans for this transition? E-turtle?
