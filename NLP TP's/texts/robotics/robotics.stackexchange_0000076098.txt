Q:

ResourceNotFound: sbpl on roslaunch

From : https://github.com/sbpl/sbpl
Installed SBPL at /usr/local
tried :
mudit@mudit:$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

`Then:
$ roslaunch sbpl_lattice_planner move_base_sbpl_fake_localization_2.5cm.launch

Shows the following error :
ResourceNotFound: sbpl
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/mudit/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/kinetic/stacks

Comment by ahendrix on 2016-09-02:
sbpl_lattice_planner probably expects sbpl to be installed in your catkin workspace as a ROS package so that it can find the motion primitives.

A:

The launch file of sbpl lattice planner was searching for sbpl by using find command which was further referencing the motion primitive file. By replacing the find command with absolute path for motion primitve file solved the problem.
