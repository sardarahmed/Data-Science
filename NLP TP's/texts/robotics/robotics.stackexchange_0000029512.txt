Q:

Which IDE(s) do ROS developers use?

While emacs and vi are great, there are also advantages in using IDEs, especially for code exploration and debugging.
Which IDE(s) do developers use for C++, Python and other languages?

A:

The IDEs page on ROS.org describes most of the non-Emacs/vi options.  To the best of my knowledge, Eclipse is the most popular.  There are scripts to help you integrate with the ROS build system, though it would definitely be wonderful if someone was willing to write an Eclipse plugin for ROS.

Hi, I'm very interested in this initiative. Eclipse is a full featured IDE for the languages used in ROS development. I'm contacting you for more info about.
