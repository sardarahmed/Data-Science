Q:

rosserial and std_msgs [solved]

Hi!
I'm looking for examples rosserial for Arduino and see that they use std_msgs/String.h but these files have no ros_lib and in the source package std_msgs String.h also not showed up. From the same header files messages?
Thanks!

do you mean this file? (ros-electric default installation path). or do you mean the message type ($rosmsg show std_msgs/String)? This message is defined in a file called String.msg

Which packages are you looking at?

A:

The std_msgs/String.h is generated in ros_lib on running the "rosmake" command as described here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
