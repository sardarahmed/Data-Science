Q:

Is there support the Yaskawa CSDA 10f (dual arm robot) with ROS?

The yaskawa CSDA 10F(dual arm robot)  looks very similar to the Motoman SDA 10F. They also use the same controller FS100. I would like to know if I can integrate ROS with it? If so can I use the motoman_driver for the integration. and how do I go about it ?

First thing to make sure is whether you have / can get 167352-1 on the controller. That is a hard requirement. Apart from the driver, it'd also need a proper URDF for the CSDA10. I haven't checked, but it could be that joint limits are different from the standard SDA10.

A:

Although we have never tested the clean room robots with the MotoROS driver, I don't know of any software changes from a standard FS100 controller.  I fully expect that the CSDA should be fully compatible.
As gvdhoorn mentioned, you will need part # 167352-1 installed on your controller to ensure the software is properly configured to support the MotoROS driver.  This is a Yaskawa America part number, so it can be ordered by contacting techsupport@motoman.com or +1 937 847 3200.  If you are outside of North/South America, your local office might have an equivalent part number (but you can still contact the US office).
Additionally, as gvdhoorn mentioned, you will need a proper URDF file for this robot.  Unfortunately, I am having trouble locating the data sheets for the CSDA10F, as I don't think we have sold this particular arm in the US.  I recommend that you compare the dimensions of your arm to the standard SDA10F datasheet here: https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/366775/Blog_Robots/SDA10F.pdf?t=1481054766982
If you require more detailed drawings, please request these from the Tech Support team.

Link to European page about the CSDA10F: here.

From what I have noticed apart from the difference in the coatings for the clean room application, there doesnt seem to be much of a difference. In that case can I just use the URDF and move it package form the SDA 10F?I have also contacted techsupport for the MotoROS software package. Thanks a ton
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-12-08:
You could perhaps use the URDF, but the link geometry seems to be rather different compared to the SDA10. You should probably at least re-do the meshes.
Comment by motoman on 2016-12-08:
Thank you, I will do that. I only see small 2cm changes in links of the arms, I will redo them. One last silly question, here I only have access to 32 bit Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS on a Virtual Machine. Is that acceptable or are there a few things i should be wary of? Thanks a lot for your quick responses

VMs are known not too work too well, especially not when doing visualisation-intensive things (RViz, Gazebo, etc). For simple robot models and tasks it may work, but you might run into issues. A dual-boot is highly recommended.

Thanks a ton guys .
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-12-13:
Please keep us informed of your progress.
Also: if you have an updated URDF for the CSDA10, I would appreciate it if you would consider contributing that to the ROS-Industrial motoman_experimental repository.
Comment by motoman on 2016-12-13:
Yes I will for sure. I will also add the URDF on the above mentioned repository when I am done with it.
Comment by motoman on 2016-12-14:
Just to double check, from what I see, I guess the indigo branch has the best support for the SDA10f. So I will go ahead using ROS Indigo?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-12-14:
For the SDA10 there shouldn't be too much difference between Jade and Indigo, but Indigo is probably a good idea, yes.
Comment by motoman on 2016-12-15:
I have decided to change the axis b and axis t stl files in the URDF of the motoman SDA10 f with meshes from the CSDA10F. Apart from them , I dont see much of a change that would affect kinematics of the robot . Suggestions?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-12-15:
We should probably move this discussion to the moveit_experimental repository issue tracker. But to answer your question: it's not just about kinematics. Robot geometry (shape, size) is also important. Not just for visualisation, but for collision avoidance as well.
Comment by motoman on 2017-01-06:
Understood:) I am working on URDF but havent been able to find technical drawings for the CSDA10F , i have also contacted techsupport and no reply yet. I have posted it as an issue in the motoman_experimental repository
