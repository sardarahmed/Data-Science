#include <tf/transform_broadcaster.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv){
ros::init(argc, argv, "urca_hokuyo_tf");
ros::NodeHandle n;
ros::Rate r(100);
tf::TransformBroadcaster broadcaster;
while(n.ok()){
broadcaster.sendTransform(
tf::StampedTransform(
tf::Transform(tf::Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1), tf::Vector3(0.1, 0.0, 0.2)),
ros::Time::now(),"base_link", "hokuyo_scan"));
r.sleep();
}
}

A:

First, make sure whether the bag file you have recorded has data or it is empty. This can be done by

rosbag play --clock data.bag

Then echo the topic to check whether the bag file is publishing data.
