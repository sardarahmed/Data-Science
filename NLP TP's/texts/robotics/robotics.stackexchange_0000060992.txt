Q:

load 3d model in qt using librviz

hi, i am trying to create a qt gui that display a 3d model from a 3d model file. (e.g .dae .stl)
is there anyway i could do it with librviz?
librviz_tutorial with the grid display provides something similar to what i need, but i have no idea how i could modify the code.
are there any examples or tutorials where i could refer to?

A:

librviz isn't really designed to be a model viewer; it's designed as a robotics data visualizer.
In theory, you could visualize a model by publishing it as a Marker, or by creating a URDF with your model and visualizing that, but both of those involve some additional overhead in addition to using the rviz qt widget.
A quick google search turns up a tutorial on Loading a 3D model in Qt, which is much closer to what you're asking for.
