Q:

No node publishing postion data

Hi
I have a small query about the vrpn_client_ros package on ROS indigo.
I have an Optitirack system with tracking tools installed and the VRPN server enabled. When I try to launch the node with:
$ roslaunch vrpn_client_ros sample.launch server:=<Comp with tracking tools ip>
However, when I launch it I do not see any nodes when I use rostopic list. Do you know how to resolve this?
Any help would be appreciated.

I install vrpn_client_ros, I can run the launch file (roslaunch vrpn_client_ros sample.launch server: = "239.255.42.99"), the terminal tells me: "connection established", my problem is when in a new terminal I am running rostopic list does not appear the published topics.

4.Run catkin_make 5. Launch using $roslaunch vrpn_client_ros sample.launch server:=239.255.42.99 when i ran it, it says the connection is established but when i tried to run $rostopic command it says that the topic didnt established yet. What did I get wrong? I really need your help.

Can you guide me through on how to create a connection between motive and ROS? I appreciate your help.

A:

To see running nodes, use rosnode list instead. If there are no topics/messages published (since none show up with rostopic list, try to debug your VRPN connection. Try using the vrpn_print_devices command to receive messages from your VRPN Tracker over CLI. When this works, specify the Tracker name manually to the node in the trackers parameter. When this works, try automatic tracker detection.

I debugged the connection. When IT were in solving other unrelated issues I got them to change the firewall setting on the computer running tracking tools. Enabling port 3883. Now it runs great.

I am having the same issue. Can you shed some more ligh on what I should do after I print vrpn_print_devices? I have already enabled port 3883 in my firewall

I have run
$ roslaunch vrpn_client_ros sample.launch server:=
and it says that the connection is established but I didnt get any data from the motive.

Is there any other code I should run? I tried to run
$ rostopic echo TrackerID/pose
on another terminal. When I use the comman rostopic list
I got /rosout and /rosout_agg
