Q:

Connect Lynxmotion AL5d arm to ROS

I am trying to connect with a Lynxmotion AL5d arm to ROS using an SSC32 servo controller (https://github.com/smd-ros-devel/lynxmotion_ssc32). I realize that I need to publish joint trajectories to do this, but am uncertain about how exactly to approach this. Any recommendations or links to tutorials that do something similar would be greatly appreciated.

A:

I used the SSC32 servo driver (my own fork) paired with the description and this script.

Thanks very much. I have found this very helpful. I was able to write a new joint command publisher that is working well. Now moving on to think about setting poses, which I can see from your code yo have done too.

I am wondering if you might know how to add the AL5d gripper to the URDF. I have had some success with altering the URDF to add a gripper, but I can't replicate the motion properly. In particular, the gripper seems to act like a prismatic joint, when it is fact revolute. Not sure how to model this.

I have not yet got to there.  I did get some new meshes for the arm but haven't got around to adding them to the URDF (They are on a remote offline machine).  Look at the phantom pincher, which has a similar mechanism.

Great, thank you. I will look into the Phantom Pincher.
