Q:

Why do we say a robotic arm have 2 dof even though the two joints rotates along the same axis?

Why do we say a robotic arm has 2 degrees of freedom even though the two joints rotate along the same axis? Why isn't it called a 1 dof robot?

A:

The degrees of freedom of a serial manipulator equals its number of joints. A more general definition can be found on Wikipedia. It is about being able to describe the state (configuration) of the robot (in terms of position) and the length of the vector required to describe the configuration. For a serial kinematic chain the length of the vector equals the number of joints. Even when the setup is redundant, the objective is not to express the pose of the final frame (tool center point or end effector), but the robot itself.
