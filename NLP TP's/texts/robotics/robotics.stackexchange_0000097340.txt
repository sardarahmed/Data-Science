Q:

Could NOT find dynamixel_controllers in ROS

I'am working in Ros melodic. I was trying to do 'catkin_make' in my workspace , but it showed me an error be like  :
-- Could NOT find dynamixel_controllers (missing: dynamixel_controllers_DIR)
-- Could not find the required component 'dynamixel_controllers'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"dynamixel_controllers" with any of the following names:

dynamixel_controllersConfig.cmake
dynamixel_controllers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dynamixel_controllers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
or set "dynamixel_controllers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
 above files.  If "dynamixel_controllers" provides a separate development
package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

I've already had the dynamixel directory in my workspace.
Does anyone know how to solve it ?
