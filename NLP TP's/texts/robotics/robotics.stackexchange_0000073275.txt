Q:

Turtlebot arm Catkin error

My ros version is Hydro, and I cannot find any tutorials for Hydro so I followed groove version on wiki, but when I get to the catkin make part, the terminal comes with these error, Can any one guide me how to fix it plz.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:159 (message):
  catkin_package() DEPENDS on 'moveit_core' which must be find_package()-ed
  before.  If it is a catkin package it can be declared as CATKIN_DEPENDS
  instead without find_package()-ing it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:98 (_catkin_package)
  turtlebot_arm/turtlebot_arm_block_manipulation/CMakeLists.txt:23 (catkin_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed

I found out that when I run git clone https://github.com/corot/turtlebot_arm
it was copied from github 'indigo' branch, I don't know. Plz some one help me.

Yeah, but I don't know if I need to install sth about MoveIt bcz of the error comments. Have you work with sth similar before? Plz guide me. Thank you so much!!

It is the Indigo version that says it should work on Hydro. Did you use rosdep to install all the dependencies?

Should I follow the Indigo version tutorials on wiki? or fuerte version?
