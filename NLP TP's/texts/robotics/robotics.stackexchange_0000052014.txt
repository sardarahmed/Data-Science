Q:

Compare Gmapping map with Ground Truth

I need to find a way of quantitatively comparing a map generated by SLAM_gmapping with the original map (.pgm) used for the stage simulation. I would use this to compare the accuracy of different mapping techniques. I have considered using an image comparison tool (I tried GraphicsMagick), but this comes with some problems. First, the scale of the saved map (rosrun map_server map_saver) is different from the one of the original map. Secondly, the positions of both maps are different. Hence, I would need to superimpose both images exactly using Gimp before comparing them, which is far from precise. Would anyone have any suggestions as to how to achieve my goal? I would either need a reliable way of rescaling the slam map or an independent algorithm to compare them... I have never studied image processing, so this is no easy task for me!
