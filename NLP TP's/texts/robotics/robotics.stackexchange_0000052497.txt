Q:

Accessing float/double list using rosparam

Hi All,
I am having a problem to access a float array using rosparam.
I have my parameters inside a lunch file as given below.

     
       max_height: 1
       min_height: 0.4
       debug_windows: false
       debug_messages: false
       camera_param: [543.848868, 0.0, 297.599352,297.599352, 0.0, 543.745831, 240.206525, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
     
  

I am able to access all my parameters by following way.
    ros::param::getCached("/target_follow/max_height", maxHeight);
    ros::param::getCached("/target_follow/min_height", minHeight);
    ros::param::getCached("/target_follow/debug_windows", showDebugWindows);
    ros::param::getCached("/target_follow/debug_messages", showDebugMessages);

can someone suggest me how can I access the list without a nodehandle object;
Regards,
Subhasis
