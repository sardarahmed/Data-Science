Q:

fovis odometry failed: NO_DATA

I'm trying to get 3D odometry data using fovis, but seems it does not work, because I face bunch of errors:
    [ERROR] [1383492092.322748950]: fovis odometry failed: NO_DATA
    [ERROR] [1383492112.108683377]: fovis odometry failed: REPROJECTION_ERROR
    [ERROR] [1383492112.464506236]: fovis odometry failed: INSUFFICIENT_INLIERS
    [ERROR] [1383492112.533878210]: TF_NAN_INPUT: Ignoring transform for child_frame_id "/camera_rgb_optical_frame" from authority "/mono_depth_odometer" because of a nan value in the transform (nan nan nan) (nan nan nan nan)

First of all, I run roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch, Then I run rosrun fovis_ros mono_depth_odometer _base_link_frame_id:=/camera_rgb_optical_frame.
How can I fix it?

A:

First try without giving any parameter. As far as I remember, it worked without any parameter for kinect.
