Q:

How many resources like shared_memory ROSCPP used?

I want to ask this question because of I found that if I don't care about resources,sometimes it will run into strange producure.
For example, when some code A run successfully.
I change to A' and failed.
So I change back to A but also failed.
Therefore, I think it maybe caused by system resources.
So my question is:
When I rebuild ROSCPP and want to run it, which resource I should remove first by tools similar to ipcs?
Thank you~

A:

When you change things you only need to recompile.  Make sure that you have recompiled all your libraries and their dependencies which connect to the changes you made.  In general a rosmake will cover everything.  There are a few packages, usually 3rd party packages that download external sources, where a make clean is necessary.

So what you mean is roscpp doesn't use any system resources like shared memory? Thank you~
