Q:

Rosserial stm32f4 unable to connect device

I am currently working to integrate an STM32F4 Discovery board with an IMU for use with ROS using rosserial_python. When trying to retrieve data from the STM32F4's on-board accelerometer (LIS3021 I believe) for testing, I encounter the following error:
Error: unable to connect with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python and groovy Arduino.
I am using the following command:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _baud:=9600
I have checked my baud rate and serial ports and verified they are correct. Even so, I ran the command with the most common baud rates from 1200 - 115200 with no success. My udev rules are correct and up-to-date for the USB-UART bride I am using with the STM32F4. I encounter this error with the board regardless of which program I have flashed to the board (hello world, blinky, accelerometer data retrieval). I have looked at nearly all the solutions posted for this problem and implemented them to no success (they are almost all for Arduino unfortunately). I am not sure what further steps to take to address this issue and would greatly appreciate any input.

A:

Because the STM32F4 is not officially supported by rosserial, can you post your *Hardware.h file and explain how did you add rosserrial support for your board.
