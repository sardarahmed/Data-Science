Q:

Using SDF 1.5 with Gazebo 2.22

Currently, I'm trying to use the world files found in here: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/commits/703385171b613f1cdaea925a61f2d93040478955#chg-worlds/sphere_atlas_demo.world". However, I noticed they are all in SDF 1.5. Can SDF 1.5 be used with Gazebo 2.22?

A:

I believe you will need to build gazebo 2.2 from source to use sdf 1.5
