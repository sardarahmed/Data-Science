Q:

spawning a robot from urdf with origin parameters through ros in gazebo 1.8

Hi
I tried to upgrade from Gazebo 1.5 from source to Gazebo 1.8  from .deb package. And everything seemed to work fine also the ROS integration worked fine by using the simulator_gazebo package.
The only thing which didn't seem to work was spawning the robot model with an initial pose:
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file robot.urdf -urdf -x 1 -y 1 -z 1 -R 3.1415 -P 0 -Y 0 -model robot

The robot got spawned in the world, but the initial position was ignored.
I think it has to do with the urdf parser (parser_urdf.cc) which doesn't come with the ParseRobotOrigin function anymore.
In gazebo_ros_api_plugin in the updateURDFModelPose function the origin_key gets both attributes xyz and rpy set correctly. so I assume that in gazebo this is not read correctly or it should be set differently now.
Does anyone have a solution for that, or should I file a bug?
Cheers Fadri

Hi everyone,
I noticed an issue that might be related with the one above. After setting the pose of a model (a box for example) in the .world file it is being spawned at the correct position but gazebo gui always says that it is at 0 0 0 0 0 0 pose. I tested with Gazebo 1.8, Gazebo 1.5 doesn't have this issue.
Should I also report it as a bug?
Thanks for help,
Karol
