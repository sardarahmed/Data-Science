Q:

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Widgets"

I am using indigo in ubuntu14.04.2 following this. I did like this:
$ mkdir -p ~/overlay_ws
$ cd ~/overlay_ws
$ mkdir -p ~/overlay_ws/src
$ cd ~/overlay_ws/src
$ wstool init

then added a ros package
$ wstool set ros_tutorials --git git://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git
$ wstool update

build it
$ source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
$ cd ~/overlay_ws/
$ catkin_make

error occured:
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;genlisp;genpy
CMake Error at ros_tutorials/turtlesim/CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt5Widgets.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Qt5Widgets", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Widgets" with
  any of the following names:

    Qt5WidgetsConfig.cmake
    qt5widgets-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Widgets" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Qt5Widgets_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Qt5Widgets" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

my questions is :
1 What's the relationship between ROS and the Qt5 ?
2 Should I install Qt5 in my PC ?
thanks.

A:

It is used to build GUIs, as the one for turtlesim (but also the whole rqt series, including rviz)

Yes. You might be fine just issuing rosdep install turtlesim. Otherwise check out the qt related packages in package.xml and install them via sudo apt-get install ...

thanks for replay. I have installed turtlesim and I can not find package.xml, I think it is created after catkin_create_pkg.
