Q:

use point to present laserscan data?

Hi,
I am new to opengl, and I have some questions about presenting laserscan data on android. In the tutorial code (android_tutorial_teleop), triangle fan shape is used to present laser scan data. Why triangle fan shape is chosen here to present the data? Can we use just point shape instead?

which tutorial code are you using? rviz is usually used to visualize data in ros. for laserscan, http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/DisplayTypes/LaserScan shows the available rendering styles.

Sorry, forgot to mention that. I am using android_tutorial_teleop to visualize laser scan data.

A:

It's visualization, so it's up to you. Choose whatever you like. Points are a common display for laser scans. One reason for choosing a triangle fan might be that it appears "filled out" and thus is better visible.
