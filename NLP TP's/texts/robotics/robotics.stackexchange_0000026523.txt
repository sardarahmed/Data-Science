Q:

my world is changed when i loaded it

Hi Dear All,
I create a world in Gazebo (Standalone Version 1.8) and I saved it, but when i load it, my world is changed?! any one know what is my fault?
for example i create this world but when i load it i have this world, I've marked the changed part.
i loaded my world with this command:
>gazebo name_of_saved_world

and i save the world from file menu (save world as).
I've attached a world with a box. test4.sdf

Can you add some code that shows the before and after differences? It will be hard for us to replicate the error just based on the images you attached. Thanks.

Model rotations don't get saved. To replicate: insert a box, rotate it, File -> Save World As. Load the saved world to see the model with zero rpy.

Dear Scpeters, There is just one code ( a SDF File), for example i put a box in world and then rotate it and in final i save it, but when i load it, the box is in original form! I've attached this SDF file to main question, you can test it and see the result.

A:

There are currently some problems with saving worlds. I've added yours to the existing ticket on the gazebo issue tracker:
