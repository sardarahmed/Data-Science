Q:

SDF files with Gazebo plugin for ROS?

Hello All,
I recently learned that URDF is being deprecated, being substituted by SDF. I have in the past used spawn_models node to introduce new models in my Gazebo environment. How do I spawn SDF models? I tried using the 'Open' option in the Gazebo world GUI but it gives me the following error:
Error [parser.cc:566] XML Element[static], child of element[model] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[model] Error [parser.cc:557] Error reading element Error [parser.cc:340] Unable to parse sdf element[gazebo] Error [parser.cc:263] parse as old deprecated model file failed. Error [Server.cc:396] Unable to read sdf file[/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_worlds/objects/first_robotv3.sdf]
The SDF file I am trying to load is exactly from the tutorials found here: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.2/build_robot/mobile_base
This should work with ROS as well right?
Please help. Thanks,
Ammar
EDIT: So after trying a few different configurations I observed that ROS has a gazebo node and a gazebo-1.0.2 node. Which one of these two supports SDF better? The default launch files I found in the simulator_gazebo stack were launching the "gazebo" node. When I try to launch the "gazebo-1.02" node I get the following error:
Error [SystemPaths.cc:262] cannot load file [sdf/gazebo.sdf]in GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH
I am really confused with which is a stable Gazebo version I should use.
Thanks

A:

Hello,
You can programmatically spawn an SDF model a couple ways:

Via a World or Model plugin:

Insert a Model from file
Insert a Model from SDF Pointer
Insert a Model from SDF string

Via a msgs::Factory message on the "~/factory" topic.
Use the gzfactory command line tool.

is this only for v1.2? I get errors when trying to insert by the last two methods in point 1.  I followed the tutorial for v1.0. error = class gazebo::physics::World’ has no member named ‘InsertModelSDF’  and same thing for 'InsertModelString'

I get errors in the last method as well: Error [SystemPaths.cc:262] cannot load file [sdf/gazebo.sdf]in GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH[/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo:]
ERROR: SDF parsing the xml failed

This is only for gazebo 1.2 and greater.

Is there a gazebo 1.2 plugin for ROS?
Comment by nkoenig on 2012-11-09:
It is being worked on as we speak.

These links all take me to the Gazebosim home page.

Unfortunately the links in this answer have gone stale.
