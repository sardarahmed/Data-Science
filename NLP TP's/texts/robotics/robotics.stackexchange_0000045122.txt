Q:

Unable to install gazebo 1.2

Hello to all
My actual gazebo-version (1.02) cant open any .urdf-file correctly.
The terminal shows following:

Warning [parser.cc:348] Gazebo SDF has
no gazebo element Warning
[parser.cc:291] DEPRECATED GAZEBO
MODEL FILE On July 1st, 2012, this
formate will no longer by supported
Convert your files using the gzsdf
command line tool You have been
warned!

And the urdf object is not visible.
So I guessed i have to install gazebo 1.2. By using

sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-simulator_gazebo

the terminal shows:

E: Unable to locate package
ros-fuerte-simulator_gazebo

How can I solve this problem?

What OS are you on? And what are your apt sources set to?

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04. But I'm a Rookie in Linux.

That warning has been present for a while, but it is a warning not an error.
There must be some other reason why your simulation is not working.
About Gazebo 1.2:

Work [has] been done to bring us
towards the more stable underlying
gazebo release (1.2.x), but there's
one more critical
task and some more testing before switching
over. @hsu

It can be installed from source, but I must highlight the strongly worded caution that "ROS Users: Never install Gazebo from here", so you probably shouldn't do so unless you really know what you're doing.
