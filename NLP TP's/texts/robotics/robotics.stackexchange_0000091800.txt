Sensor driver for Inertial Labs GPS-Aided INS-B, INS-P, INS-D

Hello, I am a user of INS-D (Dual Antenna) product. Now I want to use this product in ROS, but the driver connection (http://wiki.ros.org/Inertial%20Labs%20GPS-Aded%20INS-B%20INS-P%20INS-D) of this product has been unavailable. I want to know when to update?
