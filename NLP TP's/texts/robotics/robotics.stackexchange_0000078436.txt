Q:

Whether visual tranform can be implemented in windows machine?

My requirement is that, I need to run a tf listener in windows machine. either through Python script or cpp code.
I was able to run ,Simple Publisher and Subscriber (Python) on a Windows machine, successfully,
Also, I tried the following http://servicerobotics.eu/en/other-projects/ros-fuer-windows/
Please advise.

Hi Parvathy,
It is currently not possible to run ROS from Windows. There has been some experimentation with the Ubuntu Bash on Windows 10, but as you can read that is by no means fully functional. Another thing you could try is rosserial_windows, I haven't used it so don't know how/if it works, but perhaps that's worth a try.
If at all possible, running ROS on a supported platform is a much better option.
Good luck.
PS: I have closed your other question, as it was a duplicate of this one.

Did you mean on a Linux Machine? Like I said, it is currently not possible, bar some very experimental approaches that might not be able to do what you want even with a lot of work.

Not on Linux Machine .
I am trying on windows 7 machine.

@Parvathy: you could see whether codenotes/ros_cygwin is performant enough. Or uml-robotics/ROS.NET, rosjava or any of the Javascript based approaches. Or rosbridge_suite.
