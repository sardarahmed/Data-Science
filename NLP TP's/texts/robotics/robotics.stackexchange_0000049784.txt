A:

Yes, it's possible to run the roscore on the Android device.  You can start one programmatically using RosCore.newPublic() which will listen on the public interfaces.  (The MasterChoooser default implementation will start a Private server, not accessible by the outside world).
Once you start your RosCore, you can set the ROS_MASTER_URI environment variable on your Ubuntu laptop to your Android device: export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.10:11311
Once that is set (in all your shells), you should be able to see topics using rostopic and the other basic tools.
