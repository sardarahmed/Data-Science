Q:

why "map parameters and static map" warning occours and what are its effects?

Hello, I am setting up a navigation as explained in Navigation Stack Setup Tutorial stack for P3AT spawned. after making all the costmap files when i run the move_base.launch file the following warning appears:-
[WARN] [1413713361.087470432]: You have set map parameters, but also requested to use the static map.  Your parameters will be overwritten by those given by the map server

I just want to know why this error occurs and what are its effects on automated navigation??

A:

You probably specified something like a fixed width and height for the costmap. The message tells you that these parameters will be ignored, because width/height/resolution will be set from the static map.
Navigation with a static map will work fine. The warning mainly tells you to check that your setup is what you want.
