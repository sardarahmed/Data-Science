Q:

How to add a name to a Marker

I have searched extensively on all the tutorials but I cannot find out how to add a name to my Marker. I have a marker array and want to display different names on every marker in rviz. Does anyone have any idea how this can be done.

I think I have to use interactive markers in order to add names to all markers. Is there any other way to do it because I dont want to make an interactive marker server and interactive marker file in order to just add names.

A:

For each of your markers, you could publish another marker with type TEXT_VIEW_FACING at the same location as your original marker. As far as I know the TEXT_VIEW_FACING type displays the string in the marker.text field at the location specified in marker.pose.position.
