Q:

multiple ros release support in rosdep.yaml

The modular_cloud_matcher package requires yaml-cpp, which is installed in the ros-wide rosdep.yaml in electric but not in diamondback. For the latter, I had put an entry in our rosdep.yaml:
yaml-cpp:
ubuntu: yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev

This entry solves the problem for diamondback, but creates a conflict in electric:
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: QUITTING: due to conflicting rosdep definitions, please resolve this conflict.
Rules for yaml-cpp do not match:
{'apt': {'packages': ['yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev']}} [/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml]
yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev [/opt/ros_addons/electric/stacks/ethzasl_mapping/rosdep.yaml]

Is there a way to specify rules specific to different ros releases in rosdep.yaml?

A:

If the rules are identical, then the conflict will not arise.  However, rosdep does not process the raw rule, so the rules have to structurally the same (i.e. apt->packages-> yamlcpp0.2.26-dev vs. 'yamlcpp-0.2.6-dev').
There is no way to make the rules distro-specific.
