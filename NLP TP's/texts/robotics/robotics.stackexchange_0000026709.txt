Q:

Problem of Installing DRC from source (gzmath.hh)

Original Link : link text
Step7: There is a problem of no gzmath.hh library.
You need to change the source code in this file.
There is a typo in this file.
drcsim/ros/atlas_msgs/gz_model_teleport.cpp
Original code is
#include <math/gzmath.hh>

should change to
#include <gazebo/math/gzmath.hh>

This is a solution

A:

Due to gazebo pull request 691, all gazebo include statements require a leading gazebo/. This would explain the problem with drcsim not compiling for you, but I would suggest to hg pull and hg up, since this has already been fixed in the drcsim default branch by pull request 375.
