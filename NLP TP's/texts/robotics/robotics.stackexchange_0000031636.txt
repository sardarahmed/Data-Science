Q:

No rviz interface

Hi all,
I'm having trouble running rviz. I first start roscore in a terminal window, then open another terminal and execute 'rosrun rviz rviz.' The loading screen shows up, but the actual program interface never appears. No errors are reported. And if I run 'top' in another terminal, it looks like rviz is actually running, but it's just not visible. \
I should probably mention that I used to have cturtle and diamondback installed and I recently removed cturtle. I'm also running ubuntu 11.04.
Any help would be appreciated!

I checked and didn't see anything. I ended up just going back to using Ubuntu 10.10 and everything is fine again.

There should be printouts in the terminal or logfile. Is there anything about GLX missing or similar?

You can also add details by editing the original question btw.
