Q:

Turn off msg-generation for lisp

Hey!
I'm currently trying to speed up my build process and just notices the generation of lisp files for my msg/action-files.
Is there a simple way to turn that off? Or are they somehow used internally?

A:

This is fully documented on the wiki. See wiki/ROS/EnvironmentVariables - ROS_LANG_DISABLE:

A colon-separated list of package names for message generators / client libraries that should be disabled. Message-generation will not happen for languages in this list.

For packages build with catkin you need to list the names of the message generators which should be ignored, e.g.:

export ROS_LANG_DISABLE=genlisp

It then goes on to say:

Note that before disabling a language, you should first be very sure that none of the code you're using requires that language's bindings.

"This is fully documented on the wiki." If you know where you have to look ;) Thanks!

I found that using Google: "ros disable message generator", first hit ;)

okay, then I really should have tried longer..

still not informative enough. What need to be done to disable them?

If you're sure you're still using ROS 1, basically:
export ROS_LANG_DISABLE=genlisp

before building your workspace. That would disable Lisp.
Please refer to the wiki for the available information.
