Q:

Message order with multiple publishers to same latched topic

Scenario:

a node A publishes "hello" to a latched topic /x with queue size 1
then a node B publishes "world" to the same latched topic /x with queue size 1

Because of the latched topics, I assume a late subscriber will receive both "hello" and then "world", correct?
But is the order guaranteed, will he always receive "hello", then "world" ?

A:

According to the wiki :

latch [optional]
Enables "latching" on a connection.
When a connection is latched, the last
message published is saved and
automatically sent to any future
subscribers that connect. This is
useful for slow-changing to static
data like a map. Note that if there
are multiple publishers on the same
topic, instantiated in the same node,
then only the last published message
from that node will be sent, as
opposed to the last published message
from each publisher on that single
topic.

So with your scenario your assumption is correct. For the order, I tried your scenario and there wasn't any specific ordrer when subscribing to the topic so no the order isn't guaranteed.

I don't believe this answers @knxa's question: he asks about multiple nodes, while the wiki you quote discusses multiple publishers in the same node.

I understood the end of the quote as the case with multiples node but when reading it again I might have made a mistake. But anyway I tried his scenario using two different nodes and the messages weren't the same order each time.
