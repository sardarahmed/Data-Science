Q:

How Feasible is integrating ROS with a CAN Bus?

I am pretty new to ROS, but I am have troubles finding any useful info about the CAN Bus and ROS. Could someone point me in the right direction?
I would love to use a Raspberry Pi and a PiCAN to interact with my already existing J1939 CAN Bus network. I have it working for monitoring and such with a custom setup at the moment.

I'm not a CAN expert, but there are some packages targeting CAN, ros_canopen being one of them. Whether you can use that specific pkg I can't say, as it depends on what you are doing exactly and what you're constraints are.

Interesting that there is at least something out there. I don't need CAN Open and would be fine with just some frame level access. Perhaps just pulling out the Socket CAN Bridge/Interfaces could be useful for other CAN protocols as well... Thanks!

A:

No ROS integration (yet), but gitlab.com/lely_industries/can could also be interesting. It's event-based nature should make it relatively straightforward to map it into ROS.
