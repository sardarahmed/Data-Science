Q:

Running teleop in Safety Mode on Turtlebot

How can I use teleop in Safety Mode? Right now teleop switches the Create automatically to Full Mode.
(I would like to use Turtlebot for telepresence. It would be nice when the teleoperator couldn't drive the robot down the stairs, even when the connection drops or lags)

A:

I have filed a ticket here: https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/trac/ticket/122 to add a parameter to change the default

Thanks! Could you give me a rough estimate on where in the code I should look to change the default myself in the meantime? (Is it in turtlebot_key.cpp or somewhere in cmd_vel?)

you;ll need to edit the turtlebot_node and turtlebot_driver code to get it to run in safe mode
