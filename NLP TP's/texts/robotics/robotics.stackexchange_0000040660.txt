Q:

actionlib cancelGoal() error

Trying to cancelGoal() when no goal is
running. You are incorrectly using
SimpleActionClient

This is the error I get when I send a goal. I have subscribed to callbacks and I get a callback as soon as the goal goes active. So it surely does go active. Also, getStatus() fails similarly. But the state is described as LOST.
Please explain. I will provide additional information as necessary.
Thank You.

A:

I am creating another SimpleActionClient local variable in a member function. The Class already has a member. So, I send the goal using the local variable, where as I try to cancel it using the Class variable. It can never work. Now, I am able to Pre-empt the goal. Sorry for the trouble. Problem solved.
