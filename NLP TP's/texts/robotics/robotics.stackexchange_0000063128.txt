Q:

Rviz motion_planning Error: Failed to load library

Hi all,
I am following through the Moveit! Industrial Robot Tutorial and got stuck.
when I add motion planning or any from the moveit_ros_visualization folder, it will show the same error:

MotionPlanning
The class required for this display, 'moveit_rviz_plugin/MotionPlanning', could not be loaded.

Error:
Failed to load library /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libmoveit_motion_planning_rviz_plugin.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Could not load library (Poco exception = liborocos-kdl.so.1.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)

However, the libmoveit_motion_planning_rviz_plugin.so  is right in its place.
How can I solve this?

A:

It looks like the MoveIt plugin for Rviz depends on a particular version of the Orocos KDL library that isn't present.
I would start by making sure that all of your packages are up to date:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Do you have an alternate solution for this?

Nope. It looks like the plugin is compiled against packages that use OpenCV 2.4, and can't be used with a different version.
