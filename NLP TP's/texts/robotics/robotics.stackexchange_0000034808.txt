Q:

3d mesh model of robot based on joint states

I want to determine the projection of the robot arms (PR2) onto its cameras so that I can mask these regions out of the images. Has anyone done this before? I see some relevant code in the robot_self_filter package but it's not obvious how to proceed.

A:

You might take a look at the camera_self_filter or rgbd_self_filter packages.
