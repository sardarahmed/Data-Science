Q:

ROS Hydro Vs Indigo?

I am new in ROS. I have two queries.
Which is the difference between two Hydro or Indigo ?
Which version should I use ?
I observes most of the help and packages are available for Hydro. Does these packages also work for indigo ?

A:

Indigo is the latest version.  I recommend you use it unless you do have any specific package not available in Indigo. Go for Indigo.
Most of packages` documentation is ready for Indigo as well.
There will always be some leakages in documentation for latest versions.
For specific packages, you can always compile for source .
Look for change log on ros website for exact difference

Hi, may I ask one question about the indigo and hydro?
so what's the difference between hydro and indigo in ssh configuration? Because when I try to use ssh to remote control the robot, I'm able to control in hydro (same program and configuration) but in Indigo I cannot make it.
