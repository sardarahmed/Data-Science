Q:

`ROS_INFO_STREAM_NAMED(name, msg)` isn't streaming to the appropriate name

Lets say I have these names: "A", "B", "C"
There is a weird case where I use ROS_INFO_STREAM_NAMED(name, msg) and it streams the message to "A", even though the variable name is "B" or "C". However, when I hard code the name in: if (name == "B") ROS_INFO_STREAM_NAMED(name, msg) or ROS_INFO_STREAM_NAMED("B", msg) then it works.
I am callling ROS_INFO_STREAM_NAMED(name, msg) in my own log function which is located in a c++ interface. Classes A, B, and C all extends said interface and thus has access to log. Every ros spin cycle I would call on A's read function which calls on B's read function, which calls on C's read function. in each of these read functions, they would just log("reading"). But when I try to filter them out by name using rqt_logger_level, ros.<my package>.A would control the levels for what is suppose to be B and C's messages.
