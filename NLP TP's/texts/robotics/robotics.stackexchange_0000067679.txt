Q:

How to improve the speed of dwa in base_local_planner?

I am using base_local_planer as local planner. However, with same parameters,  the speed of robot from Dynamic Window Approach(DWA) is smaller than with Trajectory Rollout(TR). The "max_vel_x" is set to be 2.0( m/s) ( with non-holonomic mobile model).  It is easy to reach this maximum speed when controleld by Trajectory Rollout.
However, when paramer "dwa" is set to be true, the maximum value from topic /cmd_vel is about 0.25(m/s) . It is same situation when dwa_local_planner is used.
Could someone tell me how to solve this problem ? Thanks.

A:

Is your odometry correctly reporting the speed of the robot? If it isn't, the acceleration limit may be limiting the commanded speed.

Thank you for you attention! My project is implemented in a simulating way. Fake_localization is used for robot localization. I have checked out the source code of fake localization. It doesn't need the twist component in  nav_msgs/odometry msg. So twist information is not sent to fake localization

You should implement the twist component in the odometry message.
