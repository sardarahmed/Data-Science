Q:

How to get depth and IR data from realsense R200

Hi to all,
I've compiled with catkin_make the Intel Real Sense package: https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense with no errors and I'm able to display colored images by using:
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

and selecting the topic:
/camera/color/image_raw 

If I select other topics like
/camera/infrared1/image_raw
/camera/depth/image_raw

I only get a black screen.
If I try to follow this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/RealSense_R200 and I load the file realsenseRvizConfiguration1.rviz I get only the colored image and the other windows related to depth and infrared options are black.
Can you help me please?
I would like to capture both infrared and depth data coming from the R200 sensor.
I would like to show the same data as showed in this screenshot: http://wiki.ros.org/RealSense_R200?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=snapshot.png in order to get an environment map.
Thank you!!

no tips? :(

A:

Hey, try running the librealsense binaries first. If it's still black for IR views, make sure you run the patch for uvcvideo. Check out https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense/issues/12

The IR view works well if I run the librealsense binaries but only get a black screen under ROS. :(
