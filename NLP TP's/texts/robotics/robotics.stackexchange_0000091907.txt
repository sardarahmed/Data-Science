Q:

How can i use a pre loaded map in navigation stack?

I'm making a robot using RPi. I made a map using my hector_slam and rplidar on my laptop, so I have the pgm and yaml files (I was having some issue running hector_slam on RPi). How can I use it in the navigation stack. Do I need to create a map_server node and publish it? If yes, how should I do it.

This is all discussed in the Navigation Stack tutorials.

A:

You may use the map_server node at your launch file. Do not forget to upload  the.yaml file.
Something like this.
  <arg name="map_file" default="$(find robot_navigation)/maps/my_map.yaml"/>
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(arg map_file)" />
