Q:

How do I show that my project uses ROS?

I was wondering if there are any kinds of stickers or decals that I could put on my project to show that I use ROS as a platform.

If you e-mail me a shipping address, I will try to send you ROS vinyl stickers next time we get a batch in.

I feel stupid to ask but... where to get your email? :) your blog is not really giving it and I can't find a kind of PM mechanism on this forum.
