Q:

Using Turtlebot with basic DC motors

Im wondering if i can modify a Turtlebot3 burger to work with basic DC motors. Or at the very least i was wondering if i could use the HLS-LFCD2 lidar module with a standalone arduino board and DC motor shield

A:

You can make the DC motors work with Turtlebot3 Burger using a Driver like L293D or L298N on the Raspi on board. However, you will need to manually create your own driver packages and calibrate them to work well with the Turtlebot.
