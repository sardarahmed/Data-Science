Q:

Can't Install ROS Indigo on the Raspberry Pi 2 model B(jessie)

I'm installing ROS Indigo on the Raspberry Pi 2 model B(jessie). I'm following this tutorial .But I can't install ROS!!
On 3.2.1 Unavailable Dpendencies, libconsole-bridge-dev of the tutorials, I execute command "$ apt-get source -b console-bridge'".Then I get a following error message.
    Linking CXX static library libgtest.a

I have no idea how I can solve the error. Can you please give me information on that?

A:

Parse error.  Expected a command name, got unquoted argument with text "ick]r�
                                                                              ".

This looks like your CMake files have been corrupted. It's not clear why or how that happened during your build. I'd look for filesystem issues.
