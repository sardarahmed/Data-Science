Q:

Why can't ROS find this file?

#Error
error loading <rosparam> tag: 
    file does not exist [costmap_common_params.yaml]
XML is <rosparam command="load" file="costmap_common_params.yaml" ns="global_costmap"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I tried putting the files in the same folder as the launch file and that didn't work. Scanning around my hard drive I found the file located at ~/catkin_ws/src/rtabmap_ros/launch/azimut3/config/costmap_common_params.yaml
What's going on here?

A:

The file parameter to rosparam needs an absolute file name (technically it's relative to the working directory for roslaunch, but you shouldn't count on that).
You can give the file parameter an absolute path by using the $(find pkg) substitution to start with the absolute path to a package, and then use the path of the file within that package.
Since you're looking for the config/costmap_common_params.yaml file within the azimut3 package, you can refer to that file relative to the azimut3 package:
<rosparam command="load" file="$(find azimut3)/config/costmap_common_params.yaml" ns="global_costmap"/>

for more substitutions and examples, have a look at the roslaunch XML syntax documentation

ResourceNotFound: azimut3 so I found another copy of the file at ~/catkin_ws/install/share/rtabmap_ros/launch/config/costmap_common_params.yaml and changed the file reference to $(find rtabmap_ros) but ROS is looking in /home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/src/rtabmap_ros/launch/config/ instead. ??

If you want to use the install location ~/catkin_ws/install/ you should source that setup.bash file. i.e. source ~/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash

Can you find the azimut3 package with rospack find azimut3? If you can't, you should figure out why and fix that. Perhaps there isn't a package.xml in your azimut3 package, or it doesn't have the right package name in it?
