Q:

Using numpy with rospy tutorial - no module found

Hi,
I am following this tutorial. In Step 3, when I tried to run the listener, it threw following error:

~/catkin_ws/src/numpy_tutorial$ rosrun
numpy_tutorial numpy_listener.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
File
"/home/user/catkin_ws/src/numpy_tutorial/scripts/numpy_listener.py",
line 7, in 
from rospy.numpy_pkg import numpy_msg ImportError: No module named
numpy_pkg

I tried to get the module and provide it to ros but to vain. Can anyone help me fix this, please?
Thanks!

A:

There could be many reasons.

Make sure you have numpy installed.
But it should be already.
Make sure you did in your
catking_workspace catkin_make
Make sure you did source devel/setup.bash in every terminal
where you want to use rosrun or etc.
Make sure roscore is running

Thanks for the reply. Those possibilities had already been ruled out. The issue was that I kept my script file numpy_listener.py in numpy_tutorials/scripts directory. Till then I believed that all .py scripts go in /scripts while all .cpp files go in /src. My bad! Thanks again.
