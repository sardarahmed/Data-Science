Q:

ros fuerte rosdoc does not generate index.html

Hello everyone
I had a system running with multiple own ros packages using electric on ubuntu 10.04
I upgraded to ros fuerte and ubuntu 12.04
Now I have the problem when I run the command
rosrun rosdoc rosdoc camera1394 vision_msgs

which are own packages, then I get a bunch of warnings, but no errors, and inside the "doc" folder the two packages documentation are generated, but the main "index.html" is missing
The log can be found here
which contains a bunch of warnings about missing paths, but the the point is, even with missing paths, they are still warnings, and this shouldn't affect the generation of main index.html, right?
Edit1
Another interesting example is a project that uses actionlib package(defined int the manifest), and rosdoc is throwing the warning

warning: tag INCLUDE_PATH: include path `/opt/ros/fuerte/share/actionlib/include' does not exist

warning: source /opt/ros/fuerte/share/actionlib/include is not a readable file or directory... skipping.

this path is defined inside the local CMakeFiles, but in fuerte, the path

/opt/ros/fuerte/share/actionlib

exists while its /include directory is in

/opt/ros/fuerte/include/actionlib

Is that a bug?

A:

There's not a top level index.html expected, above the level of each package.  The others are just warnings and are due to providing robustness to different package layouts.
