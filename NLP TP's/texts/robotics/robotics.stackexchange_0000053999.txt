Q:

Installing perception_pcl_unstable in ROS Electric on Ubuntu 11.10

Hi everybody,
I need to install this stack for a university project: https://github.com/tum-vision/dvo/tree/electric#installation, and it is required to install perception_pcl_unstable. I googled it and found this link: http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_electric_unstable/ but it's no more active so I have really no idea on how to find and install this package. Pcl is already installed in my ROS environment but I guess it's an old version and it lacks some header files, for this reason "rosmake dvo_core" cannot commit. So I'd really appreciate if someone could point me out how to install that library or another version that might work seamlessly! Thanks for the attention!!

A:

The pcl staff is moved from svn to GitHub.
You are searching this: https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/electric-unstable-devel
This is really old and I'm sure, the newest pcl version will not work without modifications. If you get any problems, you should take a look in https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/fuerte-unstable-devel

Hi Michael, thanks for your reply! I'm quite new to ROS so I'm not familiar with the right procedure to get this software working. If I run:
dede@dede-TW9-SW9:~/check$ git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/electric-unstable-devel
I get this error:
Cloning into electric-unstable-devel...
fatal: https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/electric-unstable-devel/info/refs not found: did you run git update-server-info on the server?
I'd be very glad if you could tell me the right steps to install this library. Thanks in advance!
