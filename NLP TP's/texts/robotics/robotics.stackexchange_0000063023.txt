Q:

rostwitter consumer key

Dear Ros users,
I'm trying to user the hydro-rostwitter package (get using sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rostwitter), but when running get_access_token.py, it asks me a consumer key (not a twitter login).
But I wouldn't like to develop my own twitter app, I just would like to post a tweet from a rostopic :)
Thank you for your support!

A:

The rostwitter package use the python-twitter API (and for twitter this is considered as an app!). You have to make your personal registration to the twitter application manager to get all the security keys to put in the yaml configuration file. You have no choice ;-)
