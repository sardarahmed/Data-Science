Q:

howto: Eigen Installation

All,
This is just a brief how to on how to resolve Eigen compile time errors - which wasn't installed on my Raspberry Pi.
I kept getting the error:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package): 
By not providing "FindEigen3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has 
asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3", but 
CMake did not find one. 

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Eigen3" with any 
of the following names: 

Eigen3Config.cmake 
eigen3-config.cmake 

Add the installation prefix of "Eigen3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set 
"Eigen3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Eigen3" 
provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been 
installed.

And try as I might I couldn't find a conclusive answer. Anyway these steps should solve the issue

Download Eigen
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/

CD into the download dir
cd eigen

Create a build dir
mkdir build

Configure the build
cmake ..

Build the package
make

Install the package
sudo make install

And all being well that should be it!
Hope this helps
Mark

rosdep should have installed eigen for you (if you ran it). Did you try sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev? Is there something wrong with the system-supplied version of Eigen on your Pi?

Yep I tried installing that and had no joy. To be honest I am not quire sure what is wrong with the system supplied version - sufficed to say that a number of routes tried didn't work until i installed it from scratch

I have the same problem. could anyone solve it?

A:

Two options:

Install using - sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev

Or self build, in which case use these steps:

Download Eigen

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/

CD into the download dir

cd eigen

Create a build dir

mkdir build

Configure the build

cmake ..

Build the package

make

Install the package

sudo make install

Does it matter, if you download Eigen, in what directory you save it?

No shouldn't do. Step 6 will install it onto the system
