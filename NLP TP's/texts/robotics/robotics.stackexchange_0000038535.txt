Q:

transformLaserScanToPointCloud and pcl::fromROSMsgs?

i've taken a sensor_msgs/LaserScan and used transformLaserScanToPointCloud to get a new sensor_msgs/PointCloud.
originally my laserScan only had single values but after this, when i cout the ->points, there seems to be three values, (something, something, 0)
and since i want to be able to perform some pcl functions on my laser data i then use pcl::fromROSMsgs to take the sensor_msgs/PointCloud and transform it into a PointCloud of type PointXYZ.
and now using cout to view the ->points, there are now three values, (something, something, something).
what exaclty has happened to my original laser readings which were in meters?
i thought i could access the laser values in the PointXYZ form by using ->points._x as is shown on the struct page here... http://docs.pointclouds.org/1.3.1/structpcl_1_1_point_x_y_z.html

A:

I'm not really sure, what your problem is. What has happened is exactly what should have happened and as I read it also what you want.
The laser scan distances in meters have been converted into a point cloud with coordinates.
The (something, something, 0) is the point coordinates (x,y,z) and the z is 0 because there is no height information. They are still in meters.
Is this what you want?
