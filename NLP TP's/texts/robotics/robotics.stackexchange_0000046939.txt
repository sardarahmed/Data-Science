Q:

Does the latest version of gazebo work with ROS?

Is it possible to use the latest version of gazebo with ROS like the version that comes with the ROS installation? Because I have some problems and would like to try out the newer one.

A:

I just asked a similar question on the answers.gazebo site. From my current understanding it is not possible until the ros package maintainers decide to switch it over. There have been some plugin and api changes so I imagine that that is the hold up. Also, there is the desire to catkinize the ROS-Gazebo package before releasing the new version.

You say that you have version 1.2? I have fuerte and it says 1.0.2. Has groovy a newer version of gazebo?

Ah, I assumed you had the latest version of ROS. Groovy does have a newer version of Gazebo, but not the newest (1.3). With Groovy I can find it here:
