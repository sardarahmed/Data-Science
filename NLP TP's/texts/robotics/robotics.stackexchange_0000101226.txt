Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS packages

Hi all,
ROS provides open source packages for installation and those packages are found in "opt/ros/noetic/share" folder assuming noetic is the distro.
I might be confusing things but are there any packages that are being installed in catkin_ws/src folder? Or is it just packages created by us?
I am searching /reading around for awhile now and started on building a ROS LiDAR mobile robot with navigation stack + gmapping.
Can I confirm that after URDF is written with other parameters set (diff drive controller etc), I just have to create a package in "catkin_ws/src/launch" folder with a launch file launching the necessary packages (packages which is located "opt/ros/noetic/share")?
Thank you all.

Hi @1024son,
Please take a look at prior answer explains the difference between /opt/ros/.. and catkin_ws

Yes. If you use catkin_make for example is a convenience tool for building code in a catkin workspace.
Refer to the following documentation for more information why catkin was created and the different tools that can be used:
