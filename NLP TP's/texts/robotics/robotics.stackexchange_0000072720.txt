A:

If you have a Pi 2 Model B or newer then you can put Ubuntu 14.04 with ARM on it. Then it's as simple as using apt-get to download ROS.

The rpi3 has a new broadcom chip in it and is ARMv8 whereas the rpi2b is ARMv7. Even if you install everything on an SD card on rpi2b and move the SD card over it won't matter. I tried that same scenario just this morning with no success..
