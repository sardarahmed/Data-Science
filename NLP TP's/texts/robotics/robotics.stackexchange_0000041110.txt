Q:

How can a PIC18F4550 communicate with ROS?

Hello,
I am using a PIC18F4550 microcontroller for controlling a stepper motor and a regular dc motor through their drivers (H-bridges). I was wondering if anyone knows a simple way to make ROS communicate with the microcontroller.
I know that one way to do this is to buy an arduino chip and follow the tutorials on this website. Then write a simple code to make the arduino chip communicate with the PIC microcontroller. Unfortunately, due to budget limit and lack of time this is not possible.
I would be really greatfull if anyone could help me soon.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Two ways:

Implement the rosserial protocol on the PIC and use rosserial client to communicate with ROS. More generic and more work (you can probably reuse some code from rosserial_arduino).
Implement your own simple protocol and write a client nodes that maps this to ROS. Limited to what you implement, but quick to do.
