Q:

How to share some patches?

Hi!
I tried to use some packages with new Fuerte Beta 1, but in some reasons they did not work. I fixed this problems and made patches. What is appropriate way to share them? Some packages seems to be abandoned.

A:

If you already have patches, the best thing to do is to find the correct bug tracker for your package and create a bug report and attach your patch to the bug report.
If it is urgent, you can then email ros-users@code.ros.org with the bug id which helps make sure nothing gets lost.
Many package's bug trackers are on http://kforge.ros.org/projects/
For example if you have a TurtleBot related problem, bug reports can be submitted to http://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/trac
Also many packages and stack list the tracker in their documentation such as http://ros.org/wiki/ros_comm which has a bug tracker at https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/newticket?component=ros_comm&type=defect&&ros_comm
