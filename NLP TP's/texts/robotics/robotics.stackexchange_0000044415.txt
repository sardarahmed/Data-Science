Q:

Why does ROS_INFO_STREAM print two time stamps?

When I use ROS_INFO_STREAM, it prints two timestamps:
[ INFO] [1348651448.232151821, 1323877497.479939999]: Hello World!

What do they represent? I looked at the rosconsole docs, but I can't find an explanation.
I noticed this behaviour while running a bag with use_sim_time = true and --clock (if that makes any difference)

A:

The first time looks like your current local time while the second on looks like the time recorded within the bag-file
