Q:

Usage of sbpl_lattice_planner

Hi,
I was trying to use sbpl_lattice_planner path planning on a 4-wheeled car-like robot. I was testing it using the example simulation given in Sec 2.2.1 at this URL. I have a few questions regarding that.

It seems to me that the planner re-plans during the actual execution of motion from start to goal. Is that correct ? If it is, is there a way to switch off that feature and have it generate only one plan in the beginning ?
Is there a way to get the plan (in terms of (x,y,theta)) without actually having the robot move from start position to goal ?
Finally, I did not find a .mprim file (or a .m mprim generation file) for a 4 wheeled robot (Ackerman Steering/Bicycle model). Could someone point me to one that exists ?

Thanks,
Sagnik

Hi bro,I am working on a similar project. Where you successful in implementing the navigation stack?.

A:

Alternate answer to your second question:
Mike's method of retrieving the path is the way to go if you want to call the planner directly, but if you want to interact with any planner through move_base and still want to retrieve the path, then you can subscribe to the /path topic that gets published for the sake of visualizing it. I might be wrong about the name of the topic - it might be /display_path or /path...I don't remember. However - I believe that it only publishes the {x, y} coordinates without theta.
Long story short - look at the documentation for move_base to see how to retrieve the path, it's a move_base thing not a planner thing.
