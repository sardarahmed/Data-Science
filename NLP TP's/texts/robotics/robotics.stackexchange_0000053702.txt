Q:

I get an Assertion error when I run view_frames

I know there must be something wrong with my env but I do not know what..a lot of things started failing due to python type errors after I did a sudo apt-get upgrade
viki:~$ rosrun tf view_frames
Listening to /tf for 5.000000 seconds
Done Listening
python: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:418: T* boost::shared_ptr<T>::operator->() const [with T = tf2::TimeCacheInterface]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)

A:

Hi, the same happens to me. I've found in this question that now you can see the frames tree as a plugin in rqt. You have to install ros-hydro-rqt-tf-tree, assuming you are using hydro

Though this still fails when run as command line....I will open a bug report. Except I can not seem to find where to report a bug in view_frames?

I'm not sure if view_frames will be obsolete and rqt_tf_tree should be used instead... Maybe you can post the issue to tf repo because view_frames is part of tf and tf-tools
