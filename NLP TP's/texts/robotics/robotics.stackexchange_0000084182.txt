Q:

catkin_make works but catkin build fails

I am working with a complex software where I have to make some changes.
In order to build it, I was instructed to use catkin_make, which was (and is) working well.
Now I have to use MAVROS, and the guide says to use catkin build instead.
However, I am unable to do so, it keeps giving a lot of errors, most of them about not found header files.
Why is this happening? shouldn't both methods build fine? (or fail both)
Is it possible to work with MAVROS with catkin_make?
(I know you can't work with both at the same time, so before switching I am doing catkin clean --all)

A:

Well, it would be easier to help if you would post the error Output...
catkin build is more strict in some ways than catkin_make. E.g. it is more sensitive to having dependencies specified correctly. I guess (as there is no error output) this is your Problem.
About whether you can bild MAVROS with catkin_make, I'd like to cite the guide you linked to:

Note that while the package can be
built using catkin_make the prefered
method is using catkin_tools as it is
a more versatile and "friendly" build
tool.
