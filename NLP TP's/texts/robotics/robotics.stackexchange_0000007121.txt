Q:

iRobot Create 2: Angle Measurement

I have been working on trying to get the angle of the Create 2. I am trying to use this angle as a heading, which I will eventually use to control the robot. I will explain my procedure to highlight my problem.
I have the Create tethered to my computer. 

I reset the Create by sending Op code [7] using RealTerm.
The output is:

bl-start
  STR730
  bootloader id: #x47175347 4C636FFF
  bootloader info rev: #xF000
  bootloader rev: #x0001
  2007-05-14-1715-L
  Roomba by iRobot!
  str730
  2012-03-22-1549-L
  battery-current-zero 252

  (The firmware version is somewhere in here, but I have no clue what to look for--let me know if you see it!) 

I mark the robot so that I will know what the true angle change has been.
I then send the following codes [128 131 145 0x00 0x0B 0xFF 0xF5 142 6]. This code starts the robot spinning slowly in a circle and request the sensor data from the sensors in the group with Packet ID 2. The output from the Create seen in RealTerm is 0x000000000000, which makes sense.
I wait until the robot has rotated a known 360 degrees, then I send [142 2] to request the angle difference. The output is now 0x00000000005B.

The OI specs say that the angle measurement is in degrees turned since the last time the angle was sent; converting 0x5B to decimal is 91, which is certainly not 360 as expected. 
What am I doing wrong here? Is the iRobot Create 2 angle measurement that atrocious, or is there some scaling factor that I am unaware of? are there any better ways to get an angle measurement?

A:

There is a known bug in the angle command.  We are still working on a workaround.  In the meantime, please extract the angle yourself by using the left and right encoder counts.  See this question for detailed equations.
