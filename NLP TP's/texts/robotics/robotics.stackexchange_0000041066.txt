Q:

ros_master_uri - change it and save it

Hi,
Is there a simple way to store change of ROS_MASTER_URI? So when ever I boot up my machine (or start node) this would always be changed to for example:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ubuntu:11311

Now it changes always back to default
$ echo $ROS_MASTER_URI 
http://localhost:11311

A:

Yes - add a line to your ~/.bashrc  (assuming you're using bash)
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://ubuntu:11311

If it's in your ~/.bashrc, it'll be exported every time you open up a new terminal. If you want edits to this file to take effect in your current terminal, type:
source ~/.basrhc

Nitpicking: assuming you're using Bash, not Ubuntu ;) (type "echo $0" to know your shell, Bash by default under Ubuntu)
