Q:

using xbox 360 wireless controller in MoveIt/ rviz

I want to jog an industrial 6-axis robot in rviz via a xbox 360 wireless controller.
I have created a MoveIt package as described here and started the demo.launch. Next, I followed these instruction to start the joystick_control.launch.
Although I have installed the latest ros-indigo-moveit-full I get the error
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [moveit_ros_visualization/moveit_joy.py]: can't locate node [moveit_joy.py] in package [moveit_ros_visualization]

How can fix that error?
Thanks a lot,
kr

Your new error looks significantly different from the original problem. I'd suggest that you ask a new question instead of updating this one; that way, if someone comes along with a similar question, they'll find a simple answer.

ok, thanks :-)

Reverted back to the original question.

A:

It looks like moveit_joy.py isn't included in the Ubuntu binaries for MoveIt
There was a patch submitted to MoveIt to fix this about six months back, but there hasn't been a release since then, so that fix hasn't made it to binaries.
It looks like the MoveIt community is in the process of trying to release a new version: https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_core/issues/270
Until then, you should be able to get around your issue by using MoveIt from source.

Note though that moveit_joy.py does not allow you to jog the robot directly, but exposes a joystick interface to the interactive markers the MoveIt RViz plugin uses to configure the start and goal targets. This is rather different from how you'd normally jog an industrial robot.
