Q:

Error importing android library into android project using rosjava.jar

Hi,
There is a problem with importing
"import org.ros.rosjava.android.MessageCallable;"
"import org.ros.rosjava.android.views.RosTextView;"
which are part of the android library into the MainActivity.java inside the android project.
The project uses rosjava.jar which contains necessary java files to build; However, there is a difficulty with incorporating the android library into the project?
I am not that knowledgeable with using the android library together with rosjava. Can you advise on how to get this done?
Thank you!
Soe

A:

First, build the rosjava.jar by running ant dist in the rosjava directory. Currently, the directions to accomplish this are in flux, but it's something like this for the moment:
roscd rosjava
rosmake
ant dist
Then, you should be able to reference the Android library project by following the directions here:
