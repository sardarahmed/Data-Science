Q:

Controllability of a car with a single trailer

I'm studying the kinematic model of a car with a single trailer. This picture shows the system:

I started from the following statements:

With these constraints, I got the Pfaffian form:

And then the kinematic model:

I hope the calculations are good. Now I should use the Lie brackets to verify the system controllability, by checking the accessibility first. To do this, I need to write the system in the following form:

The question is: how do I do it? Is g the two column matrix showed in the model above? In this case, should f be a null vector/matrix? I think this should make sense, but - assuming it's all right - I wouldn't know how to proceed with the Lie brackets, because the iteration I studied leads to the calculation of this sequence: g, [f,g], [f,[f,g]], [f,[f,[f,g]]] and so on. Does it make sense with a null vector as f?
In short, the doubt is about how to choose the inputs.
Maybe it's a stupid question, but I didn't really understand the topic and I don't manage to get any concrete results.

A:

"A car with n trailers" is known to be a differentially flat system. Flatness implies that the Lie algebra generated by the system's vector fields (f and g_i's) is full. Therefore, the example you give is controllable. 
In the example, f is zero, but you have two vector fields g1 and g2 that are associated with u1, u2, respectively. You need to work on the Lie brackets that are generated by g1 and g2.
x = g1*u1 + g2*u2;
I'd like to point out some references on the subject. You can find more information how Lie algebra is used for your system.
