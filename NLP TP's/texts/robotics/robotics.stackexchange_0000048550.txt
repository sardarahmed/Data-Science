Q:

communication between winros and ubuntu didn't work

Hi there,
I was testing the ROS communication between a windows vista laptop running winros,
and a ubuntu desktop, based on instructions on this wiki page.
I run the talker.py node on one machine and listener.py node on the other. I can see the node and topic list on the listener side in command line. It seems fine. But the listener node is not picking up the message on /talker topic.
I tried the network communication tutorial on ubuntu machines and had no problems.
So I suspect that the problem is on the windows side.(It works if I run talker and listener nodes both on winros).
Does anyone know what went wrong here?
Thanks

A:

Check the network setup. I suspect, you'll need to set ROS_IP.
