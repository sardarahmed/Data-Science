@Jeremie thanks for the package again. I was able to create a 360 degree range image from my Lidar point cloud. Although you also said that some further work would be needed as well? Could you elaborate which features you think are missing for using the PCL method creating range images? I've wanted to attach a sample image, but got too few points on this board yet unfortunately.
