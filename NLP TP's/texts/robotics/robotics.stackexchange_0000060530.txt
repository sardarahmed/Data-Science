Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Rviz colorbar

I have a cloud of PointXYZI and I'm visualising them in Rviz. With the rainbow transform for intensities (you know, high values are "blue" and low values are "red"), is there a way to get a colorbar to know which colors match which values?

A:

It is standard HSV color palette cropped at 83.33% (or 5/6) of max hue value. This is because if it weren't cropped, then the color for the lowest and highest values would be the same.
You can plot it in matlab:
figure(1);
colorbar;
axis off;
map = hsv(100);
colormap(map(1:83,:));
set(gca, 'CLim', [min_value, max_value]);
