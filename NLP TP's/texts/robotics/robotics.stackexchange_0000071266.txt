A:

The page you link is pretty clear about it:

From groovy on:

sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-rviz

# or
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rviz
# or
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rviz 

You're installing for Jade, so I suggest:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-rviz

similar to all the other Jade packages that I assume you've already installed.
