Thanks 130s for formatting the code

A:

It appears that you are missing the package ros-indigo-simulators. This could be because of two things, either you
A) didn't properly set up your ROS installation environment. Or,
B) the package isn't normally installed but you still need it.
Based on the two above problems, here are two solutions.
First you could try installing ros-indigo-simulators through apt by running the command $sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-simulators. If that doesn't work you may need to go through the installation guide on the wiki again(http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/)
Hope that helps!
