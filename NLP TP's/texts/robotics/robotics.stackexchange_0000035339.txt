Q:

problem with skeleton markers in pi-robot-ros-pkg with kinect

Hi:
Has anyone used the above package with ROS? I ran roslaunch skeleton_markers markers_from_tf.launch which tracks using the openni_tracker and set my rviz config to markers_from_tf.vcg. If I use a fixed frame relative to one of the body points, say head or torso, I see the markers but not always all of them. It's like rviz shifted the image seen on the screen down or maybe its a zoom..
Anyway if I set fixed frame to the camera, ie. skeleton_openni_depth_frame, then I don't see the markers any-more. If I come real close to the camera I see the markers but they are all jumbled up and don't make any sense. Could there be a problem with the transform from the camera to the 2d representation?
Thanks in advance.

Hi,
I wrote the skeleton_markers package and just now found some issues in the markers_from_tf.vcg RViz config file that must have crept in when I went from Diamondback to Electric.  Can you try an "svn update" and see if that fixes the problem for you?  Also, are you using Diamondback or Electric?

Thank you for looking into this. I am running ros-electric. I don't have the kinect with me right now, but I'll try it as soon as I can and let you know.
