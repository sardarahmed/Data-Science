Q:

How to access Raspberry Pi over wifi?

I have to use Raspberry Pi with Arduino on a mobile robot and access Raspberry Pi on a PC through WiFi. Is it possible? Please explain how to do it?

A:

To access your RPi over the WiFi, you can use any SSH client like PuTTY. 
Once you have established a connection between your RPi and computer, then you can control  GPIOs through a TCP connection. Use Socket Library in Python for this. You have to set a static IP for your RPi though, and use it in your code. Hope it would help.
