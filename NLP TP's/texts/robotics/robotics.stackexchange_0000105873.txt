Q:

Unknown CMake command "add_service_files"

These are the code I include in my CMakeLists.txt
add_service_files(
  FILES
  AddTwoInts.srv
)

However, when I try to use catkin_make to build, the error says Unknown CMake command "add_service_files" and the error lies in the code above. However, I can't find anything wrong with these three lines of code.

A:

I forgot to include the message_generation in the find_package().
The complete section of code should be like below:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  rospy
  std_msgs
  message_generation
)
