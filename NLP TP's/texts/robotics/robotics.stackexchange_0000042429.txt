Take care in tagging, you misspelled rgbdslam

A:

In the gui that is brought up with that launch file, there is a save option in the file menu. If you want to view the model outside ros, I recommend you save it as a .ply file. It's a more common 3D model. It takes a while to save the data (It's a big file).
