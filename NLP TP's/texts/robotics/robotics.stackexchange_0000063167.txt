Q:

See a message in a message

Hello,
I'm wondering if there is any way to, from the command line only, see a message in a message ?
Here I'm using a message of the type :
ObjectData.msg:

Header header
sensor_msgs/Image image_rgb
sensor_msgs/Image image_depth
float32 constant
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped reference_board_pose
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped reference_camera_pose

Is there any way to visualize the depth image directly from the command line with something such as :
rosrun image_view image_view ...

Thanks a lot !
Best,

A:

I'm not aware of a way to do this with the current tools.
I would recommend that you write a node which splits off the depth image into its own topic, or write a custom visualizer if you want to view the rgb and depth images in the same viewer.

That's exactly what I'm working on but I was wondering if I could just avoid to do it :). Thanks for the answer.
