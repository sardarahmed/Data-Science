Q:

Communication between winros and ros on ubuntu

Hi,
I am trying to implement communication between win_ros and ros on ubuntu. I followed win_ros tutorials, but it seems a little bit confusing.
And when i create a node on win_ros, there are some errors. Someone has experience about it?

I install Fuerte both on ubuntu and windows. For win_ros, I just followed this page http://wiki.ros.org/win_ros/Msvc%20SDK%20Projects%20-%20Fuerte.  But now  I don't know how to create ros node on window, which can send messages to roscore on ubuntu.

A:

In case of Fuerte, a demo solution is installed with the sdk into C:\opt\rosws\fuerte\sdk-tutorials. Before run env.bat(or setup.bat), set ROS_MASTER_URI into setup.bat with IP address of ubuntu machine where roscore is running.
set ROS_MASTER_URI=http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:11311

Thanks! It works now. I changed that environment variable, then it runs.
