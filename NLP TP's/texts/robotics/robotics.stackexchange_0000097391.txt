Q:

realsense2_camera: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [librealsense2]

Hello.
I am trying to install the realsense2_camera package on ROS Noetic. I have installed the librealsense libraries following this tutorial, and the realsense viewer work for me.
The problem comes when I try to resolve the dependencies of the package realsense2_camera. The following error appears:
pi@raspberrypi:~/catkin_ws $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
realsense2_camera: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [librealsense2]
Continuing to install resolvable dependencies...
#All required rosdeps installed successfully

I saw that other user have the same problems but in other version of ROS, but the solutions didn't work for me. What can I do to solve the issue?
Best regards.
Alessandro

A:

First you have to install the librealsense libraries from repository: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense
Then installing apt-get install ros-noetic-realsense2_camera it works smoothly.
