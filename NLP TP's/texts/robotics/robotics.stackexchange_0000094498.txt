Q:

How can I get currently used rmw_implementation of running nodes?

I would like to check what rmw_implementation is used for running nodes. Anyone knows how to do it?
Thanks,

A:

Since the question was asking for "running nodes" you can check which shared libraries that process is using. On Linux you can run:
lsof -p <PID> | grep rmw
The list will contain one of the RMW libraries (e.g. librmw_fastrtps_cpp.so) beside generic ones like librmw.so and librmw_implementation.so.
