Q:

Drone Payload Potential

I am new to the art of building quadcopters and am looking to build a camera platform with a payload of 250g. With the following setup would that be possible or could someone point me in the direction of calculations to find out the answer.
I have a 450 frame that weighs 363g. My motors and escs are ~200g and my flight computer and transmitter are ~20 g. And my battery weighs in at 254g
I am using 2212 brushless motors at 1000 kv. My battery is a 3s lipo with a 30c discharge rate (4000mAh) and the props I am using are 1045 nylon carbon props.
Any and all help would be greatly appreciated, if you need any further Iâ€™d be happy to comply.

Perhaps this link would be of some help.
The key here is to have a payload to thrust ratio of 1:2. The thrust of your motors can be found on the datasheet and also based on the power produced, the battery and the props.
