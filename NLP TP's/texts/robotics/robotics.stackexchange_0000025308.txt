Q:

Error from launching pr2.launch

I'm using Ubuntu Precise with ROS fuerte. I tried to launch pr2 in gazebo but it seems the environment/installation is sort-of unstable. Sometimes it load pr2 properly and can be shown all sensors in Rviz, but not for other times.
Now, I'm having this kind of error when I launched pr2.launch:

Service call failed: transport error completing service call: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details

I might think that this is caused by gazebo_plugins?? Should I reinstall this package? or by other reasons??
Edit 01: I runs properly again??!!
It's so disappointing that after switching/restarting a few times from Ubuntu to Win7 (Dual OS). ROS successfully loads PR2.launch. I'm confused now!! ROS/gazebo is unstable or something else ??

sometimes orphaned ros nodes from previous run can cause instability too.  it helps to make sure everything is brought down properly before roslaunching again.
Comment by hsu on 2013-01-14:
I'd say there's a bit of instability during the transition from gazebo 0.9.x to gazebo 1.1.x because of a bunch of new features being introduced and code refactoring. Starting with 1.2, things're more stable again, and thanks to bitbucket pull request reviews :-)

A:

Unfortunately, fuerte is a bit more unstable, it's a struggle for trade off of new features and stability. I'd recommend going onto groovy for better (new feature)/(stability) ratio.
That said, out of the list of errors provided above, only this one stands out as abnormal:

Service call failed: transport error completing service call: unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details

This should have been fixed in latest release of fuerte (simulator_gazebo 1.6.16), please verify.
The other simulation warnings are fine, and python errors:

Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in  ignored
process[head_traj_controller/point_head_action-24]: started with pid [16290]

should not affect operation.
