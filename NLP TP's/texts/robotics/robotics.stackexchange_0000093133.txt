Q:

What global and local path planning algorithms do ros use?

What is ros default global path planning algorithm?
what is ros default local path planning algorithm?
Are other algorithm implemented in ros (such as D star, potential field) such that one can decide which one to use for either local and/or global path planning?
I assume the default global and local path panning are the one used in rViz when I do "2D Nav Goal" as well as in Gazebo when I send navigation goal request to the move_base server. Is this correct?

You should check out the navigation tutorials, and the specific wikis for the global and local planners. ROS is open-source so you can view the source code yourself and add any custom flavor

A:

Funny you should ask this, I am actually trying to write an evaluation paper at the moment. The default local planner presented to you in the navigation stack is the Dynamic Window Approach (and Trajectory Rollout). The default global planner can be specified as many (including D* as you wrote). Personally, for autonomous vehicles, I prefer using Timed Elastic Band as my local planner. There are a plethora of planners out there that you can search through and evaluate.
As for your comments on RVIZ and Gazebo, these are just tools. RVIZ is a visualization tool and Gazebo is a simulation tool. The 2D nav goal you mentioned is just a graphical way for you to publish a geometry_msgs/PoseStamped message on topic /move_base_simple/goal. Without an implementation of the aforementioned navigation stack, your robot won't move anywhere.
