Q:

List of ROS-enabled robots

Hi,
I know there is a list here http://robots.ros.org/. But it seems somehow short (for instance, I remember there was Parrot drone supported few years ago and it is not on the list) . Is this final list of ROS supported robots? I am particulary looking for robotic arms.
Thanks

A:

Short answer; That page isn't final list.
The long one; If you have created one robot which works with ROS, You can simply add new page on wiki.ros.org and add your new robot. I'm visiting that page's old version for years and it doesn't shows all the robots.
If you want to contribute; Search the robots which works with ROS and doesn't listed on that page, and add a new page, add new one(s). And clone and edit github page: ros-infrastructure/robots.ros.org, and request merge.
