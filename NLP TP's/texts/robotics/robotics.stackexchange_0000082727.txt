Q:

Activate move base recovery behaviors

Dear ROS users, I am writing a nav_core recovery plugin to use with move_base and the trajectory rollout planner. To effectively test my code, I would like to be able to trigger the recovery behavior in someway, or tell the planner to activate a recovery often. In fact, when the robot is stuck, recovery behaviors are not always activated. I tried to lower the value of controller_patience in move base, but it seems that does not work.
Is there a way to tell the planner to activate the recovery behaviors?

A:

move_base will invoke the recovery behaviors on three conditions: An oscillation was discovered, no global plan was received for some amount of time, or the local planner failed to find a valid velocity command for some amount of time. You can try forcing these conditions as test cases?

Thanks for the answer. In my case, tuning the oscillation_timeout parameter is enough to trigger recovery behaviour. The default value is 0, which means infinite time.

I'm sorry, but I'm confused by your comment. Did you mean that tuning the oscillation parameter fixed your problem?

yes, putting a small value (not zero) on the oscillation_timeout triggers the recovery behaviour very often, which was what I was looking for (only for testing my plugin).
