Assuming that you have installed the package beginner_tutorials, try going to your catkin workspace, for example ~/catkin_ws and running source devel/setup.bash from the command line.

Thanx for reply but i tried this solution and it is not work for me
ahmed@ahmed-HP-Casablanca-H510:~/catkin_ws$ source devel/setup.bash
ahmed@ahmed-HP-Casablanca-H510:~/catkin_ws$ roscd beginner_tutorials
roscd: No such package/stack 'beginner_tutorials'

Can I confirm that you have created the package and ran the commands to build the package as well before sourcing?
Comment by jayess on 2017-09-19:
Have you tried compiling first then sourceing the setup.bash?
Comment by ahmedadelhekal on 2017-09-19:
could you tell me the command to make compile

catkin_make

A:

Welcome! This question comes up quite often. A quick Google search will give you numerous results:

https://answers.ros.org/question/65003/roscd-no-such-packagestack-beginner_tutorials/
https://answers.ros.org/question/65950/roscd-returns-roscd-no-such-packagestack-package_name/
https://answers.ros.org/question/239650/roscd-not-woring/

This is just to name the first few results.

Edit:
I noticed that you're sourceing your setup.bash before you compile. Try doing it in this order:
~/catkin_ws/$ catkin_make
~/catkin_ws/$ source devel/setup.bash

Edit 2:
As @jarvisschultz pointed out in the comments:

rospack uses a cache of all available packages. This caches is, in turn, used by tools like roscd. This cache is supposed to be re-built every 60 seconds by default, but sometimes it seems like this fails.
You could force a re-build with rospack profile or you could try removing the cache files in ~/.ros/rospack_cache*. Both of these have helped me in the past when packages couldn't be picked up even though the environment vars were correct.

Do you have a package with that name? Did you catkin_make it from the root of your workspace? Did you source the setup.bash? What have you done and what was the result?

Can you please update your question with that information? It looks like it got cut off due to character count limitations.
