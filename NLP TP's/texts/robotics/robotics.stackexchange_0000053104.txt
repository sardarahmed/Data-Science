Q:

moveit benchmark log, where is it?

Hello!
I am trying to run some benchmarks with moveit and the rviz plugin, following this tutorial: http://moveit.ros.org/wiki/Benchmarking
The benchmark seems to run without problems, except that I am not able to find the log file to see the results.
In the tutorial it is stated this, about the configuration file parameters:

output (optional) Location for saving
computed data in *.log format. "1.log"
will automatically be appended to the
file name. The default output location
is in in your ~/.ros folder.

but I can't find the log file in that folder... Maybe it's a bug? Where do I have to search for it?
Thank you in advance!

It says optional. Did you enable this?

A:

The logs are written in a hidden folder under your home folder:
ls $HOME/.ros/log
