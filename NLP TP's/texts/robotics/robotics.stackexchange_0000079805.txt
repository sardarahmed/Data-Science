Q:

rqt_plot value vs other value instead of timestamp

Hi,
Is it possible to have rqt_plot to have just a static plot based on vector of values. So instead of having the timestamp on the x axis, could it have some other value.
For example, if you wanted to plot the position.x vs position.y in an array of geometry_msgs/Pose
Thank you.

A:

You can't with rqt_plot. But you can with rqt_multiplot. It's far superior to rqt_plot with many great features.

That's cool, I'm going to try it out now. I didn't know about this new package.
