Q:

multiple robots under one core?

Hi all!
I'm planning to use multiple turtlebots under the same core. The thing is that, for example, all the robots uses the same name for the topics. My question is:
Is it possible to modifying a little bit the code I get different names for each robot or do I need to manually go through all the code and change all the names of the nodes?
What I want is to get something like, instead of cmd_vel turtlebot1/cmd_vel, instead of joy turtlebot1/joy and so on.
Thanks!

A:

You should be able to push the TurtleBots into their own namespaces.. so when you launch the TurtleBots do something like this in your rolsaunch file
<launch>
  <group ns=turtlebot1>

    all your regular launch stuff.....

  </group>
</launch>

Maybe, also set tf_prefix to the robot name.
