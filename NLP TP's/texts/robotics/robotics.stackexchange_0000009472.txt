Q:

Does a controlling system need to be more complex than the system being controlled?

Is there any theoretical principle, or postulate, that states that the controlling system has to be more complex than the system being controlled, in any formal sense of the notion "complex"?

A:

Complexity is not a word that's used in control theory but I think I know what you mean. The short answer would be no.
Complexity in systems to be controlled is usually looked at in terms of how many state variables are needed to fully describe what's happening or, more often, how many Degrees of Freedom exist.
There is a theorem that says whether a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system is controllable, and if you look at it right it might fit what you are thinking, but LTI systems are a subset of the systems control theory works with.
As soon as you move from only math to the real world, a couple things become quickly apparent.
1) The whole point of most of control theory is to control a system that is more complex than the controller. If not for disturbances and non-linearities, we'd just write an equation for the perfect control input rather than use techniques like PID.
2) Underactuated control is a whole sub-field of control dedicated controlling systems that have not only disturbances, but also fewer controlled degrees of freedom than actuated degrees of freedom.
