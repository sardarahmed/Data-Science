but there is only one problem whenever i set static="false" my object runs into a corner of my world

Not sure about it but static prevents objects to move (another point of view required). If set to false and your object is colliding another one, force effects will throw your object away.

A:

hey i found a command that can convert .urdf  files to .model files for gazebo
rosrun gazebo urdf2model -f basic.urdf -o basic.model

??? Gazebo provides several tools that you can check there. I don't know what your application is, but you can use both urdf and models. I don't know if there're equivalent.

but in my gazebo i m not able to spawn urdf files my gazebo always crashes

so this is better option

The final solution is your choice, but maybe you could describe more the problem to understand why spawning urdf files make gazebo crash. Urdf files should spawn as well as models, so maybe there is a bug to be reported or a wrong practice to correct. But that's your choice.
