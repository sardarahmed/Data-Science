Q:

How to visualize contact forces?

Is there anything in API that can visualize the contact forces from contact sensor? If not then how it can be implemented? Basically all I need is to show an axis similar to the ones used with joints.
Also, would it be possible to extend context menu with system GUI plugin to toggle such visualization?
Thanks in advance,
Boris

A:

Well I don't know if the code below can help you, but maybe serves as a start point to solve your question.
myplugin.h
myplugin.cpp
contact.world
The code is a proof of concept about using contact visuals passing by messages. Probably you should collect information about contact using the sensor and fill correctly the message fields.
You may enable "Contacts" in menu "View". I am using Gazebo 1.4 (compiled from source).

I hope that it helps you.

That's it. I keep forgetting about existence of main menu in Ubuntu. Thanks!
