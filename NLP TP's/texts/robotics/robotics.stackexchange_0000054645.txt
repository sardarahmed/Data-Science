Q:

Why search field do an "OR" search, not an "AND" search

Hi,
I'm wondering why search bar do an "OR" search, not an "AND" search. Someone says that a part of specification and others say that is miss-configuration. Which is correct?
Askbot itself is able to perform AND search (see https://ask.fedoraproject.org/questions/).

I know this doesn't help with the actual problem, but I actually get better results by just using google (maybe adding a site:answers.ros.org).

A:

Not sure if there is a good answer to the "why?" question. I know the change from OR to AND is ticketed on the ROS Answers issue tracker though. ItÂ´s been 9 months since that ticket got created, so maybe an encouraging post there will get things moving :)
