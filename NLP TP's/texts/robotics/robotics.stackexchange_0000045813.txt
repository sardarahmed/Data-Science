Q:

Problems with ros instalation

Hello,
I am a beginner in linux and ros.
I am trying to install ros electric on a ubuntu 10.04 distribution and I am having an odd problem.
Following the instructions on the ros wiki installation page I get everything right until it is time to source the setup.bash. What happens is that the folder /opt/ros/electric only contains a subfolder called stacks and nothing else, so I can't find the setup.bash file.
Has anyone ever had a similar problem?
I have tried to uninstall it and installing it back again, but I get the same situation.
Please help.
