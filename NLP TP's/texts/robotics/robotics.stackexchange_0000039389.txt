Q:

Latest ROS doesn't install due to broken packages on Ubuntu 11.10

I am getting an error that there are broken packages when I try to install ROS on Ubuntu 11.10.  What should I do?  I followed all the directions and then it pulled out an error after I did the rosinstall command.

Could you please clarify? Are you trying to build Fuerte from source, or Electric using the Ubuntu package manager? If it's the former, please post your errors. If it's the latter, have you checked these instructions (http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu) out?

Yes, those are the instructions that I used to install Electric on Ubuntu 11.10.  I am unsure about what to do.

Please include more information, and include the actual errors you are seeing. http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support

A:

Please try again after running "sudo apt-get update".  You may have gotten an inconsistent view.
