Q:

How to get the room dimensions from a map build using gmapping?

I have a map build using gmapping. It contains the PGM image and a yml file. This map is built for the tuttlebot3 house environment. Now, I want to get the size or the dimensions of each room in the house using the map.

A:

Publish the map using map_server:
rosrun map_server map_server yourmap.yaml

Then use the "Measure" tool in rviz to measure the rooms.
