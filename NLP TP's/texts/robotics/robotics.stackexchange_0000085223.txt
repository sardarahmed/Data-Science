Q:

Display the gps topic in a bag file

Hello ROS Community
As is shown in the title, I have recorded some gps data using ublox device in a bag file, which can be seen by rostopic echo. However, I am wondering how can I be able to dispaly the gps data (probably on google map or somewhere else).
Regards.

Hi,
you have two solutions to do this:

use mapviz http://wiki.ros.org/mapviz , which has a plugin to visualize GPS messages and another got maps such as google (I use also https://github.com/danielsnider/MapViz-Tile-Map-Google-Maps-Satellite )

You can do something similar on RViz using this plugin https://github.com/gareth-cross/rviz_satellite
and http://wiki.ros.org/navsat_odometry
