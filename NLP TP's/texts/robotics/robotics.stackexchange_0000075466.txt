Q:

Path Planning using moveIt with a closed-loop chain

Hi everyone,
I am working on an robot arm which happens to be a closed-loop kinematic chain.
I achieved to have a somewhat accurate simulation with gazebo7.
Now I have installed ros Indigo and I want to do some path planning with moveIt, and view it with rViz.
So, I set up my robot to get the .sdrf file and everything works... except when I close my loop with the last joint..
The simulation doesnt take into account this joint.
When I check the shell it tells me that:
[ERROR] [1469600994.580670671]: Joint 'lely_arm__verin2/base' not found in model 'origins'

also:
[ERROR] [1469601613.254367292]: Kinematics solver N21srv_kinematics_plugin19SrvKinematicsPluginE does not support joint group g.  Error: This plugin only supports joint groups which are chains

Is it plain impossible to work on a closed loop or did i miss something?
Thank you very much

A:

moveIt and rViz rely on URDF which does not support closed kinematic chains. See this discussion:

People seem to work around this by opening the loop and then closing it using their own constraints.

I don't understand how sould I add these constraints
It seems you can bypass the problem with clever solution for parellel robots, however it is not one here..
