Q:

Using Orocos-BFL in ROS

Hi,
I've tried including BFL into catkin using both
find_package(BFL REQUIRED) and find_package(orocos_bfl) but ROS is unable to find them. I've even tried find_package(bfl REQUIRED) without success.
Any ideas? bfl, orocos-bfl are both installed on my system and I can roscd to bfl.

Hi,
I had to do something like that for compiling with bfl:
find_package(PkgConfig)
pkg_check_modules(BFL REQUIRED bfl)
include_directories(${BFL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
message("BFL include dirs:" ${BFL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
message("BFL library dirs:" ${BFL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
link_directories(${BFL_LIBRARY_DIRS})

Then don't forget the:
target_link_libraries(your_executable
  ${BFL_LIBRARIES}
)

Hope this helps.

Hi there, it works, thank you very much. I have also edited the documentation to reflect usage for others.

Hi guys, I don't know where to add above lines. To the CMakeLists.txt who uses orocos-bfl? Or to orocos-bfl's CMakeLists.txt? Thank you.

Hi. You should add it to the CMakeLists.txt who uses orocos-bfl. Cheers
