Q:

Displaying information in TF

I am working on ros and I am getting as output the parameters of satellite changing constantly. When I do
rostopic echo /topic_name
I get the output of sattelite parameters changing constantly. rostopic tells me that I have successfully published data to the my topic. How can I use this to display my sattelite in TF. Do i have to make a brodcaster/listener or can I do it with adding a node in my launch file like
  node pkg="tf" type="tf_echo" name="tf_whatever" args="0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 /topic_name" />

I am not sure whether this addition to launch file is correct. Any help would be appreciated.

A:

I believe in this case you will need to create a tf brocaster, which maps your satellite pose's into tf messages.
