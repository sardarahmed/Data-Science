Q:

how to find dependent packages in caktin

is there way to get list of the depend package as we used rospack depend, for catkin?
k-okada@kokada-t430s:/opt/ros/hydro/share/roslang$ rospack depends roslanag
[rospack] Error: no such package roslanag
k-okada@kokada-t430s:/opt/ros/hydro/share/roslang$ rospack depends-on roslanag
[rospack] Warning: no such package roslanag

UPDATE:
Original question is invalid, rospack depend should work.
$ rospack depends roslang
catkin
genmsg

A:

the roslanag package does not exist. There is roslang package without 'a' in /opt/ros/hydro/share/,is this the one you are  looking for?  if it is ,you can try "rospack depends roslang"

no, I'd like to find  roslang depends on these two package, (sorry that using roslang is not a good example)
<run_depend>catkin</run_depend>
<run_depend>genmsg</run_depend>

As the answer suggests rospack depends roslang will output the dependencies of the roslang package: catkin and genmsg

it works, I was confused when I pose original question. maybe forget to source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash or something. I'm very sorry to bother you.

No worries - that is what this platform is all about. And in the future someone else might find the question and answer helpful.
