Q:

What is the torque transmission efficiency using a bycicle chain/setup for robot?

For this robot the gear attached to the motor is linked to the gear attached to the wheels by a bicycle chain (I am using a bicycle wheel and transmission set as the parts for the robots movements).
How does using a bicycle chain affect the power transmission efficiency, how does this impact the torque?

A:

I agree with @Andy 's answer, that chain efficiency is over 90%. I'll point out that your terminology is not quite right - using bicycle chain (or any other transmission) affects power transmission efficiency. It's a subtle but significant difference between what you said (torque transmission efficiency). 
First, efficiency is defined as the ratio of output to input. With gearing, you could use a very inefficient transmission and still have a larger output torque than input torque. This would imply that your "torque transmission efficiency" is greater than one. 
Second, in the case of zero/stall speed on the drive, the torque output should be nearly the same as the input torque.
Both of these cases are covered when you talk about power transmission efficiency.
