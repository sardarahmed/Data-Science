Q:

Visualizing Trajectory with Moveit on RVIZ for ur10

Hi everyone,
I am using universal_robot and moveit packages to work on ur10 robot's rviz simulations. When I was following the tutorials for panda robot on moveit, i was able to move the robot to a desired pose by setting the position and orientation and visualizing the trajectory that it follows. I created my own node for the same purpose on ur10 and I I am able to plan the movement and see it on RVIZ, however I can't visualize the trajectory that it follows. I am not even sure if it's code related or activating some kind of check boxes on RVIZ.
Here is what my code for visualization part looks like
moveit_visual_tools::MoveItVisualTools visual_tools("base_link");
visual_tools.publishAxisLabeled(target_pose1, "pose1");
visual_tools.publishText(text_pose, "Pose Goal", rvt::WHITE, rvt::XLARGE);
visual_tools.publishTrajectoryLine(my_plan.trajectory_, joint_model_group);

I am using  ur10_moveit_config demo.launch file.

A:

I've just solved the problem. On Rviz Display menu I was trying to show /rviz_visual_tools topic by InteractiveMarkers but it should have been the MarkerArray.
