A:

Hi,
you have to add the path to the .world file
$ gzserver /<path>/share/gazebo-1.5/worlds/empty.world

Cheers, Andrei

I recreated the steps with gazebo 1.5 and for me it works. Do you get the same error when you run $ gazebo /<path>/share/gazebo-1.5/worlds/empty.world ? Or just simply $ gazebo ? Maybe you are loading something from your world file that gives a segfault.
