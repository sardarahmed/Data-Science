Q:

Running VSLAM on stereo data

I'm trying to run VSLAM on Stereo Data. When trying to roslaunch stereo_vslam.launch, I'm getting this error message
cannot launch node of type [vslam_system/stereo_vslam_node]
I suspect it has to do with files: find holidays.tree, holidays.weights, data/calonder.rtc
on the line
.....find vocabulary_tree)/holidays.tree $(find vocabulary_tree)/holidays.weights $(find vslam_system)/data/calonder.rtc ......
I don't find this file on the server ( holidays.tree, holidays.weights, data/calonder.rtc).
Do I need them? If yes, how do I get them? Where Do I start?
Thanks

A:

You actually need these files to launch stereo_vslam_node. They should be at /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/vslam/vocabulary_tree folder. If not, try to upgrade the vslam package.
Then, you can download the bag file mentioned in the tutorial:
roscd vslam_system
wget http://pr.willowgarage.com/data/vslam_system/vslam_tutorial.bag
but according to my experience you have to fix the bag file before using it:
rosbag fix vslam_tutorial.bag vslam_tutorial_fixed.bag
and then you can play it before launching the vslam node:
rosbag play --clock vslam_tutorial_fixed.bag
