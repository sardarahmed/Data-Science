Q:

Is planet.ros.org down?

When I access this site, I get a 404 "There isn't a Github pages site here". This has been happening for about a week now.
Is the site gone? If not, what's going on?

I closed this question as it is up now. Hard to tell if it has been down 8 hours ago. If you still experience issues, feel free to reopen, but please add additional details about your setup (system, proxy, ...)
Looking at the latest traffic on the repo, I guess this issue might have been fixed with https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/planet.ros.org/pull/36, though.
In general it is a good idea to check https://status.ros.org/ if anything ROS related is experiencing problems. Though planet.ros.org isn't shown there (opened an issue: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/planet.ros.org/issues/37)...

There could have been a problem with that host, but at least right now (ie: 10:23 CET) it's online for me.

A:

There was an issue https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/planet.ros.org/pull/34 resolved in https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/planet.ros.org/pull/36
