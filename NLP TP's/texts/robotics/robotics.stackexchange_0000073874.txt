Q:

visual odometry (rpg_svo vs viso2)

Does anyone have an experience between these two visual odometry packages?
(e.g. for a wide-angle camera attached to an end of robot arm)
The paper also does not seem talk about it.

Hi,
if you have chosen viso2_ros for visual odometry, could you offer me which guides/tutorials/readmes you used to set it up?

A:

Hi
Before comparison, I must mention that if you want to use one single camera, your localization would be up to a scale. Even the method that monocular viso2 uses for scale estimation holds for ground vehicles and tries to estimate ground plane. I don't think an arm robot convey such a condition!
BUT regardless of scale,
rpg_svo is much more newer and efficient than viso2. It also benefits from local bundle adjustment which makes it more accurate. The only limitation is that rpg_svo was designed for downward looking cameras. Fortunately, they have recently released SVO 2.0 that handles forward looking as well as stereo and multi-camera systems. But bear in mind that SVO is a direct method for visual odometry. All direct methods, like LSD SLAM and DSO, need global shutter cameras. Rolling shutters induce huge geometric distortions which can deteriorate accuracy. If you use a rolling shutter camera, increase the frame rate to reduce this effect.

Thanks for the insight -- very helpful. Do you have a recommendation for a stereo odometry package that tracks features?
