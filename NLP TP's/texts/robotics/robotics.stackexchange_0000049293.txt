Q:

catkin migration from rosbuild package does not mention Makefile

I don't think the Makefile in the package is needed any more, but neither of these pages mention it:

migrating from rosbuild

convert rosbuild to catkin

If I am correct that it is no longer needed, I'll add it to the documentation.

One reference point: I do not track a Makefile in my groovy branches and they work.

Thanks. Seems to work for me, too, but I wanted an "official" answer before updating the docs.

@joq: Gotcha.

A:

Yes you no longer should have a Makefile.  CMake will generate one for you in your build directory.
I've updated migrating from rosbuild to include that in the steps.
