Q:

How can i generate ROS2 .idl files?

I am not clear with my application. Maybe I am totally wrong.
Is it possible to create .idl files from the ROS2 talker-listener demo ?
They are using the standard message type as string. When I run this demo, are the .idl files generated or do i need to first write the custom messages and then convert it into .idl files ?

A:

Currently you just create .msg files (similar as in ROS 1 except that you can also define default values for primitive types). When you build your package the .idl file specific to the DDS vendor is being generated and also installed. You will find it in <install>/share/<pkgname>/msg/<dds-vendor>.

Basically yes, but there are e.g. differences in your CMake code. You might want to check the tutorials (https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Tutorials) and examples (https://github.com/ros2/examples/).

The build system section of the migration guide can be helpful as well https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Migration-Guide#build-system
