Q:

Does somebody know what the tracking method in people_tracking_filter is?

Hi, all. I am learning this people package by tracking legs. However, because there are no comments in the source code, I am confused about what kind of tracking method this package uses.
Is it a two-level tracking method? The low-level is by kalman filter, and the high-level is by particle filter. Each particle from particle filter is updated by kalman filter, i.e. a joint probablilistic data association filter(JPDAF)?
Thanks! @David lu

A:

The approach is in fact two levels. The "machine-learning" part outputs its best estimates for each time slice of where the legs are, and a kalman filter takes the successive readings and determines a smoothed estimate over time where the legs are.

Thank you！ I know that the "machine-learning" part is used for detecting the legs. The kalman fitler is used for tracking the detected legs, right？
However，  I think maybe JPDAF is a better method for tracking people for a mobile robot.

That's entirely possible.
