Q:

DC gearmotor stall current and battery capacity

I'm working on a self-balancing robot project and am in the process of motor sizing. I've read that with self-balancing robots the motors need to switch direction quickly, which can cause them to briefly draw more than twice the stall current if changing from full speed in one direction to full speed in the other direction. 
So I'm wondering if, when I find a motor with a suitable rated torque to drive the robot, would I need to work out if the battery can supply a current twice (or more) times the stall current of the motors/how long it would last before being drained?
e.g. 
Motor Stall Current: 5000mA = 5A
12v Ni-MH Battery: 3800mAh = 3.8Ah
$$I_{stall} = (5A*2) = 10A \,\,\,\,\,(2\, motors)$$
$$C_{battery} = 3.8Ah$$
$$$$
$$I_{stall} = \frac {C_{battery}}{t}$$
$$t = \frac {C_{battery}}{I_{stall}}$$
$$t = \frac {3.8Ah}{10A} = 0.38h$$
So the battery could supply twice the stall current for 0.19h.
Am I understanding this correctly?  

A:

You will almost never get the motors to sink their stall currents... But yes, your robot will last 0.38 hours.
Also, it's good to know that you should not reach the 80% of the battery's nominal voltage (at least not in LiPo or NiMh). So be careful!
