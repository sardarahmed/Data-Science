Q:

Cant install libgazebo8-dev header

Hello,
I was following the gazebo tutorials (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_i&tut=guided_i5) and needed to install the libgazebo8-dev header files. Everytime I run the command I get an error of "Unable to locate package libgazebo8-dev".
I then looked up the packages list of Ubuntu and on searching for it couldn't find it there too.
Google search for the header didn't help me either.
I guess the libgazebo8-dev has been removed from the Ubuntu library.
Can anyone help me with this? Or provide a link to download the library?
Thanks.

A:

This is not an official Ubuntu package, you need to add OSRF's packages first, like this:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
