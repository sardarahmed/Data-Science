Q:

How to change the end-effector position?

I made a moveit model of a manipulator and i want. I assign the end-effector as the last link. I want to change the end-effector tip position without editing the URDF file, like adding a new tool. Is it possible??

A:

As far as I know, endeffectors in moveit move groups can be defined only with links and joints that belong to the loaded URDF model.
