Q:

Octree to Quadtree from Octomap

Hi there,
I am using Octomapping in ROS to generate an occupancy grid but I want to use it for 2d Navigation so is there a possibility to convert the optimized Octree to a Quadtree ?

Well, it is not really converting it to a Quadtree.
But as you are using ROS for 2D navigation, you should be able to use the ocotmap_server_multilayer (LINK) which publishes multilayered nav_msgs::OccupancyGrids. Check out the 3d_navigation for a demo video.
Having a quick look at the source code, I'd say that you would have to adjust it a bit.
Maybe, using the downprojected map of the octomap_server is already enough for you, but I had problems with this (too much clutter)...
If there are better ways, I'd be happy to know as well ;-)

hi, i came across the same problem, but after i modify the octomap_server_multilayer.cpp(/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/octomap_mapping), how do i rebuild the file to make the system know that the file has been changed? I tried rosmake, but i didn't work?  Any suggestion? Thank you

Check out the source code into a catkin workspace. You should never manually change any files int /opt/....
FYI, the current ROS LTS release is indigo (two releases ahead of groovy), and the next release, kinetic (four ahead) just reached beta. You should probably change to a newer release..

I have worked it out. Thanks.
