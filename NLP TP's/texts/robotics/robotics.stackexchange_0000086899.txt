Q:

Razor_imu_9dof can't see my Sparkfun IMU (14001)?

I'm running kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 (x86).
I've followed the instructions for razor_imu_9dof, for the Razor SEN-14001 M0 board from Sparkfun. I flashed the AHRS firmware, and installed all the relevant ROS packages. I am able to see the IMU spewing data on /dev/ttyACM0, by running cat or screen.
However, when I run
roslaunch razor_imu_9dof razor-pub-and-display.launch

I just get the error:
[ERROR] [1525842655.072800]: IMU not found at port /dev/ttyACM0. Did you specify the correct port in the launch file?

What am I doing wrong? Is there a way to troubleshoot?

Just to check you're not trying to run the launch file at the same time as viewing the output using cat or screen are you?

No, I did that separately, add part of my naive attempt to troubleshoot. One thing I did notice though, the /dev/ttyACM0 device is owned by root/dialout. Maybe it's a permissions issue? I tried running sudo roslaunch, but it barfed with "unrecognized command".

if cat can read from the port then it should be fine. You can always use chmod to set the permissions of /dev/ttyACM0 . Note they will be reset every time to plug it in.

We've got a few of these in our lab, I can check what the output should look like tomorrow so you can check the firmware is correct.

I think I've figured it out. It WAS a permissions issue. I added my user account to the dialout group, and things seem to be working fine now. Thanks!

Turned out to be a permissions issue. I added my user account to the dialout group, and everything started working.

This is the answer, but I can't accept it, since I don't have enough karma.
