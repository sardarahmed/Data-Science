A:

@ramekabi this is a known issue with JDK7; it fails downloading the Gradle distribution. You can take a look here: https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core/issues/252; you should find some workarounds there.
The easiest one is using JDK 8 (from OpenJDK or from Oracle, it shouldn't make a difference). Don't forget to set JAVA_HOME environment variable properly. That should solve your problem.
