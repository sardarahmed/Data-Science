Q:

Grepping in specific ROS packages?

Hello, I want to quickly grep for keywords in a specific ROS package. I have installed and tried recoll as described in rosgrep wiki page but I am not satisfied as it does not follow standard grep syntax and does not provide context for the keywords.
I could not find an appropriate "Tools" component in trac to post a feature request, so I'll ask the question here what's the best way to grep when you're looking for context and a guaranteed synchronized search result?

 #!/bin/bash
 pkg=$(rospack find $1)
 shift
 grep --exclude-dir=\.svn --exclude-dir=bin --exclude-dir=build --exclude-dir=lib $* -r $pkg --color=always

Resulting in
