Q:

upgrade opencv version in melodic

Hello,
i want to upgrade opencv version to over 3.4 in Melodic.
Melodic installs opencv 3.2 originally,
so I tried to uninstall opencv 3.2, and re-install opencv 3.4
But some packages which are related to ROS have some problems.
Could you please give any suggestions for  tutorials about upgrade opencv version in Melodic?
my Environment are as below
Ubuntu 18.04, Melodic, in Docker Environment.
Thank you all.

A:

Trying to update opencv in ROS is a bad idea. In theory it can be done, but you must now locally build any ROS packages that rely on opencv from their source code, and you have to debug any library changes the opencv devs made. It is a non-trivial amount of work.
It is less work to upgrade to noetic if it is using a version of opencv that is acceptable to you.
