Q:

rviz not compiling mac osx

I was trying to install ROS on mac after having traded from ubuntu. I found some of these inconsistencies in the latest boost libraries.
1 . The latest boost library does not offer tr1/* hence rospack fails to compile which uses this library. Got around this by including the older boost version libraries.
2 . The rviz package does not build with the following errors. I tried including the older version for this but roscpp fails to build as there is some problem with that particular older version of boost. Any help is greatly appreciated.

A:

I managed to solve this particular issue by adding
#ifdef __APPLE__ 
#define __ASSERT_MACROS_DEFINE_VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UNDERSCORES 0
#endif

before the first include in rviz/src/image_view/main.cpp.
