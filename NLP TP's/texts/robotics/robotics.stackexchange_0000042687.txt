Q:

Gazebo initial view of world - my rendering:gui fltk tag is not working

Ubuntu 12.04
Fuerte
Gazebo 1.0.2
Hi
The following posts describe how to set the initial distance/orientation of the static camera view when your Gazebo .world file loads:
http://answers.ros.org/question/11178/initial-view-after-gazebo-starts/ http://answers.ros.org/question/12658/how-to-change-gazebo-gui-focal-lengthfov/
using a block in your .world file like this:
   <rendering:gui>
    <type>fltk</type>
    <size>480 320</size>
    <pos>0 0</pos>
    <frames>
      <row height="100%">
        <camera width="100%">
          <xyz>0.3 0 3</xyz>
          <rpy>0 90 90</rpy>
        </camera>
      </row>
    </frames>
  </rendering:gui>

but it seems like this code is being ignored by my Gazebo.  No matter what parameters I change, Gazebo always loads with the robot model at the same distance and orientation. Its annoying having to zoom-in, unlike Rviz.
Is anyone able to change their default Gazebo camera view?  @marcus-bader is this still working for you?
cheers.

Hi,
I am using electric, Ubuntu 11.10, and above code works w/o a glitch. It might be possible that while launching gazebo it is reading these parameters from somewhere else as well. I guess gazebo takes the first value, in case there are multiple tags.
Kindly post your entire .world file and also how u r launching it.
Just curious, any idea what does fltk stands for, in type tag?
