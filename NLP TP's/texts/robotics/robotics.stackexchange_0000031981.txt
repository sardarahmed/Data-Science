Q:

Why isn't there a deb package for rosinstall?

The install/setup instructions tell users to:
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install -U rosinstall

It seems like something that should be part of ros core, or at the very least have a deb package associated.
Is there any particular reason for this?
Is this something I should file a feature request ticket for?

A:

This would make a good ticket, though it something that is currently being worked on.
