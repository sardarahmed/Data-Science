Q:

creating metapackage

Is there any good reference for creating metapackage?
Or
Is there any command like catkin_create_pkg for creating normal package?

Is http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/package.xml#Metapackages enough?
As it states:

A metapackage is a normal package...

it is sufficient to use catkin_create_pkg <WHATEVER>, add the mentioned tag in the package.xml, add the respective dependencies and replace the CMakeLists.txt with the boilerplate one. Note that this needs to be exact that (whitespace!) except for the package name.

Might be a nice PR to extend catkin_create_pkg so it can generate metapackages.

A:

Actually, @gvdhoorn's recommendation is already implemented.
So now posting as answer:
catkin_create_pkg <MY_META_PACKAGE> --meta

will do what you want.
You still have to add the dependencies to the package.xml, though. But this is actually trivial...

Yes, indeed. Not sure how I missed that in the --help of catkin_create_pkg:
optional arguments:
  --meta                Creates meta-package files

I'm stumped how I missed that as well. This feature is actually four years old and I've been copying around files to achieve this :-D
