Q:

How to put urdf in parameter server?

Is it possible to use the urdf format robot in parameter server similarly like xacro format like below? :
<!-- Convert an xacro and put on parameter server -->
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py $(find pr2_description)/robots/pr2.urdf.xacro" />

<!-- Spawn a robot into Gazebo -->
<node name="spawn_urdf" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="-param robot_description -urdf -model pr2" />

I have downloaded a robot model in urdf, but its very large so it's little hard to convert it into xacro format. So i want to directly use it, but what to for this robot_description parameter?

A:

This is documented on the roslaunch/XML/param page:

textfile="$(find pkg-name)/path/file.txt"

The contents of the file will be read and stored as a string. The file must be locally accessible, though it is strongly recommended that you use the package-relative $(find)/file.txt syntax to specify the location.

So for robot_description, that would be:
<param name="robot_description" textfile="$(find pkg-name)/path/file.urdf"/>
