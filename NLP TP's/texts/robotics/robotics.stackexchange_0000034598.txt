Q:

Code completion problem with Eclipse Galileo

Hi,
I was trying 2 ROS packages which I created by myself. The strange thing is that one of them is having no problem with code completion while the other one cannot give any proposal. It just returns "ni default proposal" when I press "ctrl" and "spacebar". They are c++ anyway, both of them
Any idea?

A:

One could be missing the proper #include statements in the header, the manifest could be missing dependencies, or you could be using the wrong namespace.
Additionally, if you've changed your manifest.xml, you may need to remake the Eclipse project. I find that I occasionally need to do this. I just navigate to that package on the commandline and issue a make clean; make eclipse-project command and restart Eclipse.
