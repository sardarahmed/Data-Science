Q:

How to playback Rosbag pointcloud2 files

Hi, I'm currently trying to playback a rosbag file made with pointcloud2, and I can do it with the rviz software, but for my purposes, I need to be able to go back and forth in the video (like you would in a media player with a regular video) , not just in one direction. Is there any way to do this?

please check http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_bag as you may need rqt_bag_plugins as well.

I tired using that but since all I have access to is camera/depth_registered/points, it only gives me the option to view it as raw and as a plot. Is there some way I could make it show me the image/video too?

Alright so I got it working. In case anyone else has this same issue what I had to do was first run the convert_pointcloud_to_image command and then load /camera/depth/cloud_image into rqt_bag
