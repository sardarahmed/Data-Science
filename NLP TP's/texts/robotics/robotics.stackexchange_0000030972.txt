Q:

install openni_kinect failed

Hi, all,
When I install openni_kinect and run
rosinstall ~/openni_kinect PATH_TO_EXISTING_ROS_TREE 'http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=openni_kinect.rosinstall'

it shows:
rosinstall operating on /home/meka/openni_kinect from specifications in rosinstall files  PATH_TO_EXISTING_ROS_TREE, http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=openni_kinect.rosinstall
ahhhh error opening file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/meka/PATH_TO_EXISTING_ROS_TREE'
Usage: rosinstall PATH [<options> ...] [URI]... 

rosinstall: error: None

Can you help me?

A:

You need to replace PATH_TO_EXISTING_ROS_TREE with a path to an existing ROS tree.
This assumes you have completed a general ROS installation previously.
If you're using ubuntu and have installed from debians you should use something like /opt/ros/diamondback  or if you're checking out from source you should use ~/ros.

Thank you. I have completed the general ROS installation. I do not know what's wrong. But i did it again from the beginning, it worked....
