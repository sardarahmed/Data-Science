Q:

Running executables without using rosrun or roslaunch?

MY QUESTION :
Do ROS topics  still properly communicate (subscribe/publish) in the following situation, even though I DID NOT run executables by rosrun/roslaunch?
If not, is there way to run ROS executables without using rosrun/roslaunch?
SITUATION :
By running catkin biuld ,
executables are created as (~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/PROJECT_NAME/sample_node)
If I try to run the execuatble as follows, it prints seemingly okay results on screen.
./catkin_ws/devel/lib/<PROJECT_NAME>/sample_node

(roscore runs somewhere anyway.)
NECESSITY :
I want to add ROS publish function in my pre-developed code, which cannot be run by rosrun/roslaunch because it contains other pthreads.

I've done it with Python and didn't have any problems.

A:

I've executed the binary files of ROS c++ nodes directly (without using rosrun or roslaunch) without any problems in the past, as long as your environment variables are set correctly this should work without any problems.
