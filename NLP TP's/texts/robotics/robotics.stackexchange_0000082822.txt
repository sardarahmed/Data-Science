Q:

rostopic import error

I am following the Ros Nodes tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes and have come across an error at point 6 in the website above^^.
When I try to run the '$ rosnode list' command in the new terminal window, I receive the error below:
import rostopic
ImportError: No module named rostopic
and therefore cannot continue the tutorial.
Has anyone overcome this problem?

How did you install ROS? Are you sourceing your setup.bash file?
source /opt/ros/<ros-version>/setup.bash

Can you see rostopic in the list when you type python -m pip list? You should also see other ROS-related modules such as rosdep, rosbag, ...

Having same issue. any solution to this?
P.S, I install ROS as mentioned in DOCs. And I'm sourcing setup.bash (source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash). I also can see rostopic in the list when I run python -m pip list but some other ros stuff are there!

Have you installed conda? If so, you should comment or remove the line export PATH="/home/<user>/<anaconda-version>/bin:$PATH" in your .bashrc (source).

@Hug. No I did not install 'conda'. shall I? cuz there is noting about 'conda' in ROS documents as prerequisites as I know!!

I believe that @Hug asked because many people have problems similar to this when they use Conda. I'd say that you probably shouldn't install it if you don't know what it is.

A:

try sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosnode
