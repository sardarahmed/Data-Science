Q:

Client Service in different folder than Server Service

I've created node that has service in package (i.e. pk1). The associated headers files reside in devel/include/<pk1> folder. Now I need to create client service in another package (i.e. pk2) which needs to use the header files of service created in pk1. How can configure the project so that it can detect the location of service's headers automatically. I've added the full path of the header, I'm surprised this not working at all, which it should be from C++ perspective. Any suggestions? I'm using C++, kinetic, and Ubuntu 16.04.

Which headers are in the devel/include/<pk1> folder? Where is your service definition?
Comment by CroCo on 2021-11-02:
@Geoff headers generated automatically for .srv file. I do believe there are three header files (i.e. the request and response classes).

A:

In the package for your client, follow the steps in 3. Dependencies of this tutorial. This explains how to add a dependency from pk2 to pk1 so that your client can access the header and library files for the service.
