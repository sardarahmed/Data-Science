Q:

People tracking with fisheye camera

Hi all,
I'm working with some fisheye cameras mounted on the ceiling. What I want to do it them is to track people, get their position in the ground plane and an estimate on their speed. I've never worked with this kind of cameras before, does anyone have any idea on how to tackle this issue?
Thanks

A:

For working with the cameras, your first step will be to calibrate the camera, and obtain the rectified image stream using image_proc.
