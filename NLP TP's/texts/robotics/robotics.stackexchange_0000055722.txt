Q:

change source of octomap

Hello,
I want to customize the octomap_server with this scenario that just points with yellow color considered as occupied and all others considered as free, so what is the best way to do it ? my mean is i should get the source code of octomap_server and modify it and compile and use it, or is there a easiest way?
Thanks in advance
