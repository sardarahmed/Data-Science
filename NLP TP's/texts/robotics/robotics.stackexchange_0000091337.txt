A:

It looks like  you're using a version of geometry2 from ROS2 in Kinetic. Make sure you're uisng the right branch. To that end, if you'd like more help, please update your question with informatoin about how to reproduce your environment. All the binary packages you've installed from what source, as well as all the source code checkouts that are in your workspace and what versions you have present. If we can reproduce your problem it is easier to help you. Otherwise we'll just be guessing.
