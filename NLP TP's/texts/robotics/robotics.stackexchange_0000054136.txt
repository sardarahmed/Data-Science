Q:

To tag svn project during ROS release steps more easily

When releasing from our svn as a development repository, we first create tag on svn repo and then run bloom (if there's a way where this step is not needed then this question loses its necessity. I appreciate if you could share that!).
Is there a way to automate this tagging for svn ? Tagging itself can be done by a single command like:
svn copy https://%TRUNK_PACAKGE% https://%PATH_TAG_PACAKGE%-1.0.1 -m "Releasing 1.0.1"

But I think of catkin_prepare_release that tags for git project. Is it bad/inappropriate to add svn support to catkin_prepare_release?

A:

Have you actually tried to use "catkin_prepare_release"? It already supports svn and does the tagging of the repo for you.
