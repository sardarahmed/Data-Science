Hi,

The tutorial is just for Indigo. http://wiki.ros.org/innok_heros_gazebo/Tutorials/Simulating%20Innok%20Heros

Hi,
you can get the required packages from github using the branch 'kinetic':

https://github.com/innokrobotics/innok_heros_gazebo
https://github.com/innokrobotics/innok_heros_description
https://github.com/innokrobotics/innok_heros_control

Usage is just the same as described in the tutorial for Indigo.
Regards,
Sabrina
