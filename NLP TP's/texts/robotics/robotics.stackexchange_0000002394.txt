Q:

LIDAR solutions

I am surprised by the price range of Lidar applications considering the simplicity of the design. I try to make a simple project that requires lidar for object recognitions etc. I wouldn't like to use Visual Recognition such as OpenCV. 
Regardless of that I am trying to understand why Lidar solutions are so expensive you can see

Small lidar sensor goes for 20,000$. 
I strongly believe that Lidar is the next step in robotic applications but I am not sure why it is so EXCLUSIVE. 
I have seen few projects that go for around 200$ but their performance is very bad. 
I hope you can answer what makes a Lidar so expensive and what are some cheap systems a hobbyist can afford. 

A:

LIDAR are expensive because it normally relies on Time-of-Flight of the light for measuring each point distance. They are simple in theory of working, in practice it requires a good design in electronics and the sensors.
I don't think LIDAR is the next step, but stereo vision could be. This is not related to OpenCV, and most optical vision system designers forget the basics that is a good camera with good optics. This is your source of information, if you have a bad one, you difficultly get good results. This means at least ~$200,00 for camera and lenses, with RAW protocol for images, and goes on.
