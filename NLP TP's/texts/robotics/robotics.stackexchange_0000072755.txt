A:

The status page shows that rosbridge_suite is available in the repository.
Is your Pi 2 running Ubuntu 14.04? Is the rest of your ROS install on the Pi 2 from apt, according to the UbuntuARM instructions? Are you running ROS Indigo?

No, I am running pure raspbian wheezy. Isn't rosbridge available for raspbian ?

If you installed the rest of ROS from source, you'll have to install rosbridge from source too.

How do I do it ? Please guide me through the steps. And also the rosauth part. Sorry for being a complete newbie.

Which install guide did you use to install ROS?
Comment by nishthapa on 2016-03-16:
I installed Indigo version from the official tutorial on installing ROS on raspberry pi. [http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi]

I figured it out. It built rosbridge_server from source. Seems we also have to take care of the dependencies such as python-bson for rosauth. Thanks anyways.

Yes. the final step of the raspbian install guide discusses how to add additional packages from source.
