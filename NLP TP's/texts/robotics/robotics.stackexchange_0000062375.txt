Q:

Navigation Package Dependencies

Hello,
My question is a repeat of this question.
I'm trying to set up the navigation stack on a robot possessing only odometry sensors (wheel encoder, IMU published to /odom /imu). No camera/laser. The robot is also using robot_state_publisher to publish the transformations between robot coordinates.
I want to use only odometry sources (wheel encoder, IMU) to navigate the robot, so my plan is to use robot_localization to fuse the odometry data and use fake_localization to localize the robot on the known map.
The navigation tutorial says that we should create a package:
roscreate-pkg my_robot_name_2dnav move_base my_tf_configuration_dep my_odom_configuration_dep my_sensor_configuration_dep

So the question is what should I put instead of my_tf_configuration_dep my_odom_configuration_dep my_sensor_configuration_dep
Thanks
