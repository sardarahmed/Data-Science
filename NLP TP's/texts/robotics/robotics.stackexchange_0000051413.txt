ROSTopics: Only advertiser can publish?

This is a simple question about the ROS communication between nodes.
Only the  node that advertises a topic can publish to it?

A:

Yes and no :-)
A node needs to create a publisher, which advertises a topic, in order to send anything. So "yes": a node can't send anything on a topic if it doesn't advertise it.
However, multiple nodes can advertise the same topic and publish on it (as well as multiple subscribers can listen). So "no": not only the first node that advertises a topic is allowed to publish on a given topic name.

What that means is that multiple nodes may advertise the same ROS topic, is that right?

Correct! Updated my answer to explicitly state that.
