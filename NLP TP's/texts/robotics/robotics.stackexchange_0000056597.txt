Q:

image_geometry::PinholeCameraModel - operator= missing

Hi,
is it possible, that the operator=() is missing in the image_geometry::PinholeCameraModel? The following assertion is not true as expected.
void ClassA::setCameraModel( const image_geometry::PinholeCameraModel& cameraModel )
{
   mCameraModel = cameraModel; // fails, since no operator= implemented
   assert( mCameraModel.fx() == cameraModel.fx() );
}

a workaround would be to
void ClassA::setCameraModel( const image_geometry::PinholeCameraModel& cameraModel )
{
   mCameraModel.formCameraInfo( cameraModel.cameraInfo() );
   assert( mCameraModel.fx() == cameraModel.fx() );
}

Or is it not recommended to use the PinholeCameraModel that way?
