Q:

Cheap light fast industrial robot?

Why are there no simple industrial robots (mainly for simpler tasks like pick and place) that are:

Cheap (<=3000$), 
Lightweight (<=10kg),
Fast (600mm/s at end effector),

Most of the robots I have looked at cost more than 10K$. Many of cheap ones use 3D printed (plastic) components.  I'm not sure whether these robots can survive the continuous and long operating hours in factories.
What's the bottleneck developing such a system? 
Why haven't established companies not entered this market?
Could someone give some insight on this?

A:

High quality, low backlash gear reducers cost almost \$1,000 a piece. You need one on all 6 joints. High powered servo motors cost $500+ each. High quality bearings that allow for high pre-loading are a few hundred each. Add the electronics, aluminum body, labor, etc. and it adds up quickly.
