Q:

local_path not showing in rviz while robot navigates

Hi Folks,
I'm trying to show the local path when my robot is navigating, but the path only shows for about 1/4 of a second, disappears for about 10 seconds, then repeats.
I know I am subscribing to the right topic because, like I said, I can see the local path. But why is it behaving that way?
Any parameters I need to update (maybe through dynamic configuration while the robot runs), or is there a more appropriate topic I shall subscribe to?
The global path shows up fine, and it stays until the robot reaches the goal point.

A:

Not sure, you can try looking at the path being published using rostopic echo <topic_name> and see if there is anything fishy going on. The only thing I could think of is that zero length paths are being published on the same topic (maybe multiple nodes are publishing to the same topic). You could also do rostopic info <topic_name> to make sure only one process is publishing to it.

The teleop/joystick node does not seem to be publishing, so I did not see any conflict. I still can't figure out what is going on. I'll also make sure that the robot is not actually latching to the last command that teleop sent it.

Any updates on debugging this?
