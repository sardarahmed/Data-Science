Sick LMS100 Scan to Scan object filtering

Has anyone ever done scan to scan object filtering/comparing?  I want to use it to eliminate false positives.

Would this work for really small objects?  I kind of want to filter really small objects out and only react to bigger objects.  (Objects less than 2cm wide.)

It works with the persistence of objects, not their size. Maybe not good for your application.
