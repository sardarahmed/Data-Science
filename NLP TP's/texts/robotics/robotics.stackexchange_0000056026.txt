Q:

Is there a good tf2 tutorial?

Hi there,
Trying to use tf2 with hydro here, however I just can't get the tutorials to work. For the broadcaster, the C++ tutorial is missing. For the listener, there is a structure that seems to be inexistant : tf2_ros::PoseStamped; and the broadcaster uses another structure geometry_msgs::TransformStamped. The listener tells me there it doesn't have a lookupTransform method.
I think the existing tutorials are outdated, so any help in understanding how to use tf2 : listeners, broadcasters and data types, would be appreciated.
