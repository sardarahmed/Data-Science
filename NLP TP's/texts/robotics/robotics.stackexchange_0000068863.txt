ROS Answers SE migration: Quadrotor GUI

Hello all,
Is there a good open source GUI for piloting a quadrotor based on ROS ?
Thank you.

A:

I do not know about any special GUI. If I would need it, I'd create a perspective for it in rqt.
Well the big question is, what do you need to show there?
Camera? -> rqt_image_view
Battery? -> multiple rqt_plugins available (unfortunately no standard one)
You could also add RViz to it to Visualize a 3D Model of the copter.
I wondered a bit myself and found that one:

Looks pretty useful I think, but I do not see if you can get the code.
Maybe you can get it here, but I do not know if it is really the same one:

Hi, thank you for ground_station this is close to what I was looking for. As for your quesiton, all quadrotors are similar and data you want to see in UI is also similar. Image_View, battery, roll, pitch, etc. I want to make it as generic as possible.
