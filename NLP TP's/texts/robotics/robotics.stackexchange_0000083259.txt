A:

Afaik, Ubuntu Loki is not an actual Ubuntu release. It's a release of Elementary OS.
The ROS buildfarm does not build any packages for Elementary OS specifically, so that's why apt cannot download a Release file for it.
To install ROS on Elementary OS Loki (which is based on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)), you could try two things:

change loki to xenial in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
override OS detection in all ROS tools by setting the environment variable ROS_OS_OVERRIDE to ubuntu:16.04:xenial (see wiki/EnvironmentVariables - ROS_OS_OVERRIDE for more info).

After fixing point 1, you can try to apt-get update again and see whether your packages will install.
With 2, tools like rosdep should work.
Note that as Elementary OS is not an officially supported distribution, you could run into compatibility issues. But the only way to know is to try it.

See #q40081 for a related question btw.
