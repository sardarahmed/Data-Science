Q:

gazebo7 trying to load libgazebo.so.8

When I try to start gazebo 7, gzserver reports an error that it can't open libgazebo.so.8. I've installed from debs on ubuntu 16.04. I have checked ldconfig and the rest of my filesystem and I can't find any trace of libgazebo8.

A:

I imagine this is related to this question.
If you've mixed a lot of different source and deb install versions, I recommend you apt remove everything related to gazebo, ignition and sdformat, and make uninstall from the build directories. After that, dig around your /usr directory and delete anything related to gazebo, ignition and sdformat that you can find.
After all this you should be in a relatively clean state. But to be sure, when installing Gazebo 7 from debs, use the --reinstall flag:
sudo apt install gazebo7 --reinstall

I figured out that the busted source installs that I had done had created bad versions of gzclient and gzserver that were linked to libgazebo8. I had tried make uninstall, and it would probably have gotten rid of gzserver and friends, but the make commands were all broken because I had uninstalled libignition and some other dependencies already.

Glad you solved the problem. This kind of thing happens to me all the time.
