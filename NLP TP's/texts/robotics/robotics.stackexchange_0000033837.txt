Q:

topic /scan of hokuyo node can't link to the /base_scan of gmapping node

When I launch gmapping node and hokuyo node, the topic /scan of hokuyo node can't link to the /base_scan of gmapping node.
Do I miss something ?

A:

You just need to remap (rename) the topic.  It is explained on wiki in Remapping Arguments .
For you specific case, either:

Running from command-line, rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node scan:=base_scan
In launch script, <node pkg="hokuyo_node" type="hokuyo_node" name="hokuyo" > <remap from="scan" to="base_scan" /> </node>

You don't need to do it yourself. You do need to provide the transform between base_link and base_laser by publishing the appropriate transform. You can easily do this with a static_transform_publisher if your laser is fixed with respect to the base. Gmapping can transform the scan itself with tf.

Thank you ! Now it can link to the gmapping node. but I have one thing I don't understand, the /scan of hokuyo node is "base_laser" coordinate frame. Do I need to use tf to transform coordinate to robot's "base_link" coordinate frames, than input to the gmapping ?
