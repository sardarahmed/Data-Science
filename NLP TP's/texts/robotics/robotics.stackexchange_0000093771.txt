Q:

How to make a geometry_msgs/PoseArray and then visualise it using rviz?

Let's say I need to run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance between two points.
Can anyone tell me how to make a pose array and use it to store the shortest path and then visualise it?

If you construct a PoseArray message in your Dijkstra node and publish it, then there is a built-in Display type in rviz to visualize this data. Might I suggest you edit your question and be a bit more specific about what part of this process you are having trouble with.

A:

The easiest way to do this is using the nav_msgs/path message already available on ROS
http://docs.ros.org/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Path.html
It consists on an array of PoseStamped with a common header..

Plus the nav_msgs/Path it has a built-in display in rviz.
