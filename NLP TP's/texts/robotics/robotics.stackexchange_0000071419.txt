Q:

Identifying valid fields in JointTrajectoryPoint message

When interpreting the JointTrajectoryPoint[] array provided by a JointTrajectory message, what mechanism is used to determine if optional fields (like velocities and accelerations) are valid and should be used when interpolating the path or are invalid and should be ignored?
Is it required that any unused fields are set to zero?

A:

The JointTrajectoryPoint contains individual arrays for position, velocity, accelerations, and  effort.  Array types under CPP are vector types (see here).  If any of these arrays are empty (i.e. vector.empty()), then they can be considered invalid.

Thanks!  I missed the fact the variable length message arrays include a length prefix.
