Q:

Keep axis value in rqt_plot

Is it possible to keep axis value in rqt_plot for the next time (with either matplot or pyqtgraph) ?
When I reopen rqt_plot, it plot the last chosen topic but it does not keep the manual axis value that I have set previously.

This was not implemented when you asked. But Austin has been working on related issues and it might be working as you want it now. If not please file as feature request.

This shouldn't be hard to do, but it isn't implemented. You should file a feature request.

A:

I've submitted a pull request to rqt_plot which saves and restores the plot limits without breaking autoscaling: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/pull/292
