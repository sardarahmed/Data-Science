Q:

how to solve these errors :[ModelDatabase.cc:290]

when I run gazebo, the errors appear:
1\Error [ModelDatabase.cc:290] Unable to parse manifest.xml for model[http://gazebosim.org/models/double_pendulum_with_base]
2\ Error [ModelDatabase.cc:290] Unable to parse manifest.xml for model[http://gazebosim.org/models/kitchen_dining]
3\ gazebo: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:418: T* boost::shared_ptr::operator->() const [with T = gazebo::common::NumericAnimation]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.

I just filled a ticket for this issue: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/537/manifest-error-in-gazebosimorg-database

A:

manifest.xml files are being deprecated, and replaced with model.config. We are doing this to remove naming conflicts with ROS. New models in the database will not have manifest.xml files. So the solution to your problem is to upgrade Gazebo.

Am I assuming right that the update to 1.5 for ROS Groovy users will solve this issue?
