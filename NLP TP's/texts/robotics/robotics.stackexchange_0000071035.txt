Q:

max_vel_theta parameter?

Hi everyone,
In the source code "trajectory_planner_ros.cpp" of base_local-planner,
I didn't see it retrieve the value of the parameter max_vel_theta.
(You can confirm it with following command)
grep -R 'param("max_vel_theta"' *    // I got a empty response

But in my test, the parameter value DID control the in_place rotational velocity when the robot start to move to a goal.
Is there anybody can tell me how the parameter value work??
Thanks!

Seems that trajectory_planner.cpp fetches it from dynamic reconfigure. According to this answer dynreconf might get its value from the parameter server.

A:

It's retrieved from dynamic_reconfigure. The dynamic_reconfigure callback will be called once when the node is up.
