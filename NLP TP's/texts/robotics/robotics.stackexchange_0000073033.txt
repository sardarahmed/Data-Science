I have not heard any success stories yet. I'd suggest you start with an installation of Ubuntu 14.04 if possible and then follow the UbuntuARM instructions.

Ubuntu mate?
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-03-24:
Most of the Ubuntu MATE images that I see are based on Ubuntu 15.04, which isn't supported by the ARM builds of ROS.

Comment by ahendrix on 2016-03-25:
I can't find a version of Ubuntu 14.04 that is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 either.

I used an Ubuntu 15,04 image and compiled ROS (core) from sources. I didn't have any problems.

A:

I have just finished successfully installing ROS Indigo on my raspberry pi 3 with debian jessie. I installed from source using this guide:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
The guide is greatly detailed, but you have to remember to be patient for it will take a lot of time and energy to successfully install ROS from source. And remember to apply the patches for "collada-dom-dev" and "rviz" if you want to install the full-desktop version.

Hi. Could you please tell me where the patch for collada-dom-dev is? There is a link on the tutorials page but I couldn't find the patch on the link given. And how is it to be installed?
Thanks.

From there, there is an attached file that you can download.
then go to folder: cd ~/ros_catkin_ws/src/robot_model/collada_urdf/src
place the file there and rename it to fix.patch
then apply the patch: patch < fix.patch

It is also mentioned in the guide to change the name from "collada-dom" to "collada-dom-dev". That also did not work for me as rosdep still could not find collada-dom-dev. I changed the name from "collada-dom" to "libcollada-dom2.4-dp-dev" and that fixed the issue.
Comment by RohitM on 2016-05-26:
Thanks. But for me it seems the folder that you suggested is not/has not been installed. There's no robot_model folder. Do you know why that would be?
Comment by Clapton-Is-God on 2016-05-27:
are you installing ros command line or ros desktop version?
Comment by RohitM on 2016-05-27:
ros command line version
Comment by Clapton-Is-God on 2016-05-27:
For the ros comm you don't need to build collada, you only need libconsole-bridge-dev and liblz4-dev. You can skip to the next step of the installation: resolving dependencies.

Hello,
I am following the same for desktop version. All worked find but at last while building the catkin workspace I'm getting cmake error for rqt_topic. Can you help me? If you need any more information I can give you.
Comment by RohitM on 2016-06-29:
I'm sorry but I don't have my RPi with me so I can't really test out any solution. Moreover I'm not sure of the desktop installation. Hopefully someone else will be able to shed light on this, perhaps if add the error message people might be able to help better.
