Q:

move_base Get plan not working for real time data?

I am using P3dx bot and want to get a plan using move_base Get Plan service, so when I use data like tf and scan messages directly from robot I get the following warning :
[ WARN] [1359052907.140636231]: Could not get robot pose, cancelling reconfiguration
[ WARN] [1359052908.140937352]: Costmap2DROS transform timeout. Current time: 1359052908.1409, global_pose stamp: 1359052907.5267, tolerance: 0.2000 

and planning fails, but when i store the data in bag file and then run the code it works fine.
Can anyone please help..

A:

This is a typical problem in the navigation stack if you use a distributed navigation architecture. The time delays are a problem.
Your global costmap has a parameter "/transform_tolerance (double, default: 0.2)"
What that means? If your sensor data or your odometry data is too old they are not reliable information to build a costmap. Remember that a costmap is like a mapping method (but not slam). A very high cumulated odometry error could end up in an absolutley incoherent costmap.
In any case try to increase the transform_tolerance parameter and after that told us your results please!
