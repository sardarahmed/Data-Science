Q:

SolidWorks->urdf exporter strange behavior when click "Preview and Export..."

I have tried to export a milling machine from a SolidWorks assembly to urdf using the exporter plug-in developed by Stephen Brawner. There were no problem when completing the form "Configure and Organize Links" but in the next step when I clicked the button "Preview and Export..." the exporter just stopped without any error message.
The assembly can be downloaded from [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3366143/urdf/MillingMachine.zip
Does anyone know about this problem?

A:

Many bugs have been addressed through newer updates of the software. Download the latest version and see if there your problem still exists. If so, please report it to the issue tracker: https://bitbucket.org/brawner/sw2urdf/issues/new

Unfortunately the same problem happened to me even with the newest version (as of August 2017). It's already been raised as an issue (see the link) on Bitbucket so I'm not adding a new one.
