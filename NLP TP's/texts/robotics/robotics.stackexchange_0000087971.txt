Q:

Localhost vs. 0.0.0.0

I've had problems troubleshooting IP addresses with my setup and want to verify some questions, if you could help:

Should I use localhost or 0.0.0.0 when referring to myself, or does it have to be a real URI?

I have read that if you don't have a DNS name, you must use ROS_IP and not ROS_HOSTNAME, yet I see many examples where an ip address is used for ROS_HOSTNAME. For example, here: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_setup/#network-configuration near the end you will see ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.9.100

Can I omit both ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME usually - unless I have more than one network adapter. If I have more than one then by default ROS would use all of them. But by specifying ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME I can limit ROS to a specific one.

Followup

On the computer running ROSCORE, I understand that this is almost always sufficient.

export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
Under what special circumstances does that computer need a specific IP address of ROS_MASTER? And does it ever need ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME?
Thanks!

Do you have links for these examples?

You can use either ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME. If you have both set, ROS_HOSTNAME will take precedence. See https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_IP.2BAC8-ROS_HOSTNAME

Here's one example specifying an IP address with ROS_HOSTNAME: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_setup/#network-configuration (you have to look for it near the end of that page.)
Also what about localhost vs. 0.0.0.0?

That tutorial that you linked to is incorrect. ROS_HOSTNAME is for hostnames such as localhost, not IP addresses as that's what ROS_IP is for.

A:

I'll answer your question to best of my ability.

From this answer on superuser, you should stick with localhost:

127.0.0.1 is the loopback address (also known as localhost).
0.0.0.0 is a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown or non applicable target (a no particular address placeholder).

That tutorial that you linked to is incorrect. ROS_HOSTNAME is for hostnames such as localhost, not IP addresses as that's what ROS_IP is for.

You can use either ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME. If you have both set, ROS_HOSTNAME will take precedence.

As for the bottom line, it's a matter of preference as to which to use. I prefer ROS_HOSTNAME because I can use it in launch files in the <machine> tag and it's easier to remember hostnames vs. IP addresses.

I'll take a look at it if you post it as a new question. You can provide a link back to this question keep the continuity
