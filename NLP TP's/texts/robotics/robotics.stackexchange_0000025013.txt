Q:

ros2 launch file was not found in the share directory

Using python in ROS2 and launching with:
ros2 launch package_name launch_file_name.launch.py

I get

file 'launch_file_name.launch.py' was not found in the share directory of package 'package_name'

How to fix this?

A:

Make sure setup.py includes the correct launch files. Inside data_files in setup:
(os.path.join('share', package_name), glob('launch/*.launch.py')),

Also import:
import os  
from glob import glob
