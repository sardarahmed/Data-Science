Q:

rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials [Package not found]

Hello,
I'm really new at using ROS and I was doing some tutorials.
The tutorial I'm actually stuck on is the following:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
I have a problem when I do the following command :
`rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials` 

I have the following error :
[rospack] Error: no such package beginner_tutorials
So I'm wondering why since the command I ran previously to this one was :
$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
This command should create the package but it apparently doesn't. I'm wondering what I missed.
When I tried the command :
roswtf
This is what it return :
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
Package: beginner_tutorials
Cannot find dependencies for package [beginner_tutorials]: missing beginner_tutorials
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/anon/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
Does anybody understand my mistake ?

A:

Ok so I understood my problem.
The solution is before to do the command:
$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
We need to be located in :
~/catkin_ws/src
For some reason I was in ~/catkin_ws and thought it was the right place to create the Package.
