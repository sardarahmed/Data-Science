openni_ros vs openni_kinect

What is the difference between the ros-diamondback-openni-ros and ros-diamondback-openni-kinect ubuntu packages?

A:

The difference is that you want to install the -kinect one, not the -ros one (see this thread). I'm not sure why there are two or why the -ros one hasn't been removed from the package list, though.

Use openni_kinect  the stack openni_ros one was temporarily there and so as not to break people's checkouts it has not been removed.  It will be removed in the near future.
