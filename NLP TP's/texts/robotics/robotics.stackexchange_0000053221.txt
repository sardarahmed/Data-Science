Q:

Arguments in Setup.py

Can someone please explain the arguments to generate_distutils_setup (reference)?
I have two use cases that I have not been able to get working with my catkin releases.

Release a script so I can rosrun it

Release a library so I can import it in other rospy code.

The 'scripts' argument I've gathered actually means GLOBAL scripts that are run without rosrun. The relevant code  is actually not too helpful for this.

A:

The Installing Python scripts and modules how-to may be more helpful for your use cases.
You are correct that the scripts argument is not recommended (or needed) for normal rosrun scripts.

Thanks for your reply. I've updated the wiki to include a link to that page. One related followup question not addressed there is:
What is this mapping? package_dir={'': 'src'})
Comment by joq on 2013-07-31:
It makes the src/ subdirectory the root of your Python modules.

Okay, but why is it a dictionary?
Comment by joq on 2013-08-06:
ROS is simply using the standard Python interface. I suppose it allows multiple root directories for resolving module imports. I've never needed anything except the {'': 'src'}.
