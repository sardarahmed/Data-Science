Q:

MOVEIT+GAZEBO: joint_states namespace and move_group problem

Hi all,
I'm trying to configure moveit + gazebo, so far I managed to configure the setup assistant for a new robot as the tutorial shows.
My problem is that move_group node listen to "/joint_states" and the GAZEBO publish i with a namespace i.e /robot/joint_states.
(I figured it out by following the kinematics tutorial so as by typing "rostopic list -v").
So, my question is how do I configure move_group to listen to /robot/joint_states.
My github repository: https://github.com/nirlevi5/robo-service.git
Attached an Example rqt_graph photo.
Thanks
Nir

A:

A simple solution is add a remap entry on move_group.launch
<node name="move_group" ...
...
<remap from="/joint_states" to="/your_robot/joint_states" />
</node>

Great, It works now.
Now the Rviz plans based on the gazebo model configuration.
But still, when I'm following the kinematics tutorial I get joint values equals to zero, I thought it should take it from the /myrobot/joint_states topic?
