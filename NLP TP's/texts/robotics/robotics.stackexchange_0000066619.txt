Q:

rosinstall file location in repository

Hi,
Is there a default location where to put rosinstall files, such as, some_repo_minimal.rosinstall and some_repo_demos.rosinstall, within a git repo containing some packages (including a meta package).
For now, they are placed it in the meta package, as shown below:

some_repo

some_repo (meta_package)

package.xml
CMakeLists.txt
some_repo_minimal.rosinstall
some_repo_demos.rosinstall

package_one
package_two
...
.gitignore
README.md

But I am not sure if this is a good location.
Would it be better to place it in the root folder, or is there no convention for this.
Cheers

A:

Just my two cents: as far as I know there is no real convention for this. I always place them in the root of the repository (so as a sibling, next to the packages).
I've also seen projects where the .rosinstall files (and all other installation related materials) were placed in a separate repository, but that does not seem to be too common.
Personally I wouldn't place .rosinstall files in a metapackage, but there is no technical reason for that.
