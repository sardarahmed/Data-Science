Could you formulate better your question? Show us more data about the problem. It helps us to help you.

Laser values are not getting accurately, laser is kind of blinking so some values are missing  from left and and right

I tried here your laser settings on my robot. And the laser is working fine.

I just copy and paste what you post here. So the problem isn't in the code.

Then what could be the problem?
It's like the laser is flickering from left and right to some angle because of this laser values are missing

A:

I was checking here and increase the range tag
Try to increase <min>0.08</min>
The values are just an example, but it is a good start.

Isn't the clip tag used in camera plugin?
Comment by Teo Cardoso on 2020-04-06:
Sorry, I'm out of my mind. Try to increase 0.08
Comment by me_saw on 2020-04-06:
No problem
Thanks I'll try it out
Comment by me_saw on 2020-04-06:
Thank you:)   it solved the problem I increased the min to 0.28 and it's working perfectly. I guess the problem was the dimensions of my model
can you answer it separate so that I can mark it as correct.
