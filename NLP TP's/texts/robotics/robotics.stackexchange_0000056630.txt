Q:

Upload packages to respositories

Hi all!
Im working on a Pharo library for writing ROS nodes, also in some tools based on this technology and some commands for infraestructure.
I am wanting to start to use apt-get for installation because of facility. I was thinking in upload in ubuntu developer, but then im quite sure it will be better to have it here.
How do i get a space for uploading my work? I searched through site and google without cool results, there is any tutorial? there is any standar process?
Thank you very much!

A:

ROS has nice and powerful releasing envionment.
"Releasing" your package allows you to install your package via debian binary (ie. via apt-get on Ubuntu). You can start from looking at "Get Involved" wiki page and specifically at Release Binary Packages section, where its tutorial using bloom is linked from.
Before starting that tutorial, you have to have at least your package publicly accessible on a distributed revision control system such as github, code.google.com, bitbucket etc. Being comfortable with SCM tools (eg. git, svn, hg) would be very helpful (or almost required) if you're not yet.
