Q:

rosjava and eclipse projects

Hi all,
why do rosjava projects with generated eclipse files (./gradlew foo:eclipse) require a rosjava project and why does this require several "apache_xmlrpc_*" projects?
Is it possible to use a rojava eclipse project without these dependencies?
Best regards,
Andreas

A:

If you're not developing rosjava, then you can create an Eclipse project that will depend on the required jars instead of linked projects. Simply add an external dependency on ros.rosjava_core:rosjava:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT and the transitive dependencies (e.g. apache_xmlrpc) will be pulled in automatically.
Otherwise, AFAIK the answer is no. The eclipse plugin will generate dependencies as project dependencies.
