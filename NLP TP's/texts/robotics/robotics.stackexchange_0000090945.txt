Q:

move_base alternative

Dear all,
I was wondering if it exists an alternative(s) to the move_base ?
I have searched but I did not find anything.
Thanks,

Not sure whether it qualifies as an "alternative" for you (as it is more of a refactor), but: move_base_flex?
It might help board members suggest alternatives if you could describe what it is that you find lacking in move_base and/or prompted you to start looking for alternatives.

Thanks a lot for your reply. Yes, I have looked at it already. As you mentioned it can be helpful while searching what is lacking in move_base. But what I am searching now is an easy and simple architecture that could be much more optimized than move_base that I can freely add/remove other functionalities.

Yes, I have looked at it already.

Any reason you did not mention this in your post then? You literally wrote:

I have searched but I did not find anything.

if you found move_base_flex then that cannot be "nothing".

But what I am searching now is an easy and simple architecture that could be much more optimized than move_base that I can freely add/remove other functionalities.

What would "optimized" be? move_base_flex was specifically created to allow people to "freely add/remove other functionalities" by using Action and topic interfaces for everything, instead of compiling everything into a single node.
Could you update your original post with some more information on what you are looking for, what you've tried / already found, why that didn't work for you and what it is that you'd like to see specifically?

Thanks a lot for your reply. It is true that I did not explain very well the reason why I searched an alternative for move_base. I will update the question this evening in order to be more clear.

A:

locomotor is one option.
