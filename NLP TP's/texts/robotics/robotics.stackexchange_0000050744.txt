Q:

Localization just from IMU data?

I am looking for a solution to localize my robot just from IMU data.
The problem is, I have some Velodyne 3D scans and IMU data saved to a Bag file and I need to make an Octomap or some other 3D reconstruction method to visualize my data.
I tested the laser_scan_matcher and the pointcloud_to_laserscan package but the first throws an error Invalid number of rays: 62112 and the second one just outputs something like a straight line that doesn't change. So both are not capable of processing the huge amount of Velodyne data.

I got both the laser_scan_matcher and the pointcloud_to_laserscan package working with the VLP-16 LiDAR, you have to change some parameters for both to get them to work.

A:

I don't know what a Velodyne is, but I know you can't hope to use just the IMU unless it's a VERY precise one. For a more indepth discussion of this problem see my answer here.
You could try to augment the IMU by using a Kalman with both the IMU data and the odometry data.
And you could also give the Velodyne stack a try.

Thanks for your answer. Velodyne is a very precise 3D LIDAR Scanner with I think about 1million points per second. But there seems to be no package to use this point cloud for localization. The problem is I had a 2D Laser scanner mounted on my robot also, but the data was not recorded right...

And I need a way to get a 3D reconstruction of the Velodyne data, and I only have a thermal cam image, Kinect RGB Image ( depth image also got lost somehow) and an omnidirectional image...
