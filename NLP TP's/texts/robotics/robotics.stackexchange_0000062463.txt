Q:

Cannot find nav_core and costmap_2d on ros-indigo

Hello,
I am trying to run rosmake robotino for the robotino-ros-pkg in ros-indigo installed from the .torrent file for 64 bit.
I have set up my workspace with rosbuild according to this tutorial. My environment variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH looks like this:
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH = /home/viki/indigo_ws/sandbox/robotino-ros-pkg:/home/viki/indigo_ws/sandbox:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
When I run rosmake I get the following error:
[rospack] Error: package 'robotino_local_planner' depends on non-existent package 'nav_core' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update

I ran rosdep update but nothing happened. The same goes for the package costmap_2d. When I check the share directory in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, these packages are indeed not there. However, I managed to find them on ros-hydro.
What am I missing here? Where are these package on ros-indigo or how can these packages be installed?

A:

nav_core and costmap_2d are ROS packages and part of the navigation stack. It is available for indigo, so you should install ros-indigo-navigation.
