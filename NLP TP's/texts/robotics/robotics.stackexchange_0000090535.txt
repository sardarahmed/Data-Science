Q:

Can I launch rqt_console from a .launch file?

Just for convenience as I am deep into debugging and am constantly doing a multi step launch procedure. I looked through the wiki and googled, but cannot find a reference to it. Maybe its not possible?

A:

You should be able to add the following to one of your included launch files:
<node pkg="rqt_console" type="rqt_console" name="rqt_console"/>

The name field is arbitrary.
I don't use rqt_console but if there are arguments you are adding during your multi step launch procedure you can further customize by doing:
<node pkg="rqt_console" type="rqt_console" name="rqt_console" args="[custom commands]"/>

I do that with rqt_reconfigure sometimes. For example, if I start a node and name it my_node and my_node has a dynamic reconfigure server, then I can do:
<node pkg="rqt_reconfigure" type="rqt_reconfigure" name="my_rqt_reconfigure" args="my_node"/>

That causes an rqt_reconfigure GUI to open and it will pre-select my_node for me.
