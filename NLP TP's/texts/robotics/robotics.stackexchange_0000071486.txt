maybe plot full error logs for us to understand your issues. It seems like function declare problems.

A:

If you want to use the ipc_bridge functions, you must first add the path of the specific binary to Matlab:
addpath('Address to the /bin directory of specific message which includes all the mex-compiled binary files')
