Q:

I am getting an error: while running launch file

Error message:
roslaunch file contains multiple nodes named [/map_server]. Please check all <node> 'name' attributes to make sure they are unique. Also check that $(anon id) use different ids. The traceback for the exception was written to the log file 

Launch file:
<launch>
    <include file ="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/minimal.launch" />
    <arg name="map_file" default="/home/gab/catkin_ws/src/gabS/Desktop.yaml" />
    <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(arg map_file)" />
    <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/amcl_demo.launch" />
    <include file="$(find turtlebot_rviz_launchers)/launch/view_navigation.launch" />
</launch>

There's probably another node tag with the name map_server in the launch files you include here. In ROS every node must have unique name tag attribute (as the error message describes). You probably wanted to use only one of the map_server node, therefore delete the remaining ones.

A:

As @l4ncelot said you have another map_server node with the same name launched in amcl_demo.launch so just get rid of your node in your launch file (since you only need one map_server ) and put the map_file argument in the amcl node :
<launch>
    <include file ="$(find turtlebot_bringup)/launch/minimal.launch" />
    <arg name="map_file" default="/home/gab/catkin_ws/src/gabS/Desktop.yaml" />
  
    <include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/amcl_demo.launch">
         <arg name="map_file" value="$(arg map_file)"/>
    </include>
    <include file="$(find turtlebot_rviz_launchers)/launch/view_navigation.launch" />
</launch>
