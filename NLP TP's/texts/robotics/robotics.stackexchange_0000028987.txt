Q:

How to include a model which is not in default path

I have build a model by myself, it's a folder named "My_Model", it has correct .config and .sdf file. I can include it by moving the folder to default GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH, and write
"

model://My_Model

"
in the .world file. It works.
But what if I don't move this folder to the default path, and I don't want to modify the default GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH, how can I include it?
For example, its absolute path is /home/idontwan/Documents/My_Model, how should I write the script?

Hi Idontwan,
As Clement mentioned you only need to add to GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH the path of your model. There is no risk if you modify this variable. When you open a new terminal this variable is reseted. If you want to make this change permanent edit your ~/.bashrc.
You can check the current value of GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH typing:
echo $GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
/usr/share/gazebo-9/models

then you can add your model path with, you can add as much as paths as you want, you need to split them using :
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:<path to your model>

Regards
