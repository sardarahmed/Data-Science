Q:

Has anyone used April Tags with ROS?

My adviser had pointed me in the direction of these but it looks like they require their own OS/program.  Has anyone used these in conjunction with ROS and could speak to their performance or ease of use?
ROSHydro with 12.04, three Kinects I'm trying to combine into one universal frame and image.
Edit: http://wiki.ros.org/april_tk http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/april_tags_node.html looks like some tools have been developed.  Has anyone used these as well?

A:

Not sure about "AprilTags", but they look pretty much the same as AR tags. Check out this package by Scott Niekum -- http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar, it's a ROS wrapper for the Alvar AR tag library. It works really well and seems quite robust.

I've used both april tags and AR tags. As of this summer, the ar_track_alvar package was easier to get up and running, but I haven't tried it in Hydro.

But which is better (apriltags_ros vs ar-track-alvar) in terms of localisation accuracy ?
