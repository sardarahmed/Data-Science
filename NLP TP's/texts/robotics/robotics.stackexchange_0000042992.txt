Q:

Can I make the new rosjava project that send the message through existing node?

Hello.
I have a question.
When I enter the command 'roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch', I can see the node '/turtlebot_node, /turtlebot_teleop_keyboard'.
So I think,
If I make the new rosjava project that send the message through '/turtlebot_teleop_keyboard' node, I can actuate the TURTLEBOT using my rosjava project.
Is it possible?

A:

I believe you may need to start with the general ROS overview and tutorials here.
To answer your question, you would more likely want to communicate directly with the base_controller node. I imagine turtlebot_teleop_keyboard does not have a subscriber that would relay to base_controller. So no, you cannot send a message through it.
