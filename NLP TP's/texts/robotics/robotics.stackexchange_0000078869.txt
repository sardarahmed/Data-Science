Q:

problem installing orocos_toolchain from source

I am trying to use orocos_toolchain to control a multi link robot in real time, but when i try to install the orocos_toolchain package from source, i get the above error:Failed to process package 'utilrb'
, what is the problem?  I followed this link to install it.
I also tried this ros tutorial: but i get the error:
 Could not resolve host: git.gitorious.org

this same error was also coming when i followed first link but after i changed git wit http it worked, but in the second link, i dont know what is the problem. So how do i install orocos with ros ?

A:

Is there a reason why you want to build the orocos_toolchain from source, if you're using indigo on Ubuntu you can use the binary packages instead.
Otherwise, can you try this updated documentation instead: https://github.com/orocos-toolchain/orocos_toolchain/blob/installation-script/INSTALL.md
