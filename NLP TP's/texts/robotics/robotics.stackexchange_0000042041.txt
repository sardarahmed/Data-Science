Q:

How to solve 'boost/graph/boykov_kolmogorov_max_flow.hpp: No such file or directory'?

I download pcl for ros:
  svn co http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_electric_unstable

And I rosmake,it shows the error:
  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/sam_pcl/perception_pcl_electric_unstable$ rosmake

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

This is because PCL doesn't do a good job of keeping track of which version of boost you're using; it assumes you have the latest.
That particular thing was added to boost fairly recently, and your version of boost is too old.
You'll need a newer linux (say, Ubuntu Precise), or to install a newer boost.

How to update boost on an older version of ubuntu? Thank you~
Comment by Mac on 2012-08-09:
Build it from source; see boost.org.
Comment by sam on 2012-08-10:
Is there any way to build from apt? Thank you~
Comment by Mac on 2012-08-11:
You could look for a PPA; figuring that out is better-suited to an Ubuntu forum of some sort. (My machines run precise, so haven't had to figure this out for myself.)
