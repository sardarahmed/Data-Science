Q:

Node graph for multi-host ROS network

Assuming a situation where nodes are distributed on multiple hosts, is there a way to oversee at a single view which nodes are running on which hosts?
I imagine something like rqt_graph, with which has an option to show either ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME values on each node. I found this page in rocon tutorial but doesn't seem to provide what I'm looking for.
It can be a useful debug tool multiple hosts ROS network.
Here whether it's a single or multi ROS master network does not matter to me.

A:

I'm not sure, but does the multimaster_fkie/node_manager show this info?

Although I don't find exactly what I asked on multimaster_fkie/node_manager, I guess multimaster_fkie pkg might be the best practical solution in ROS1 for communication between ROS masters. (Cont'd)

multimaster_fkie requires running synchronization nodes per each ROS master (as in the tutorial) AFAIK, but I don't know any examples that dynamically discover masters.
