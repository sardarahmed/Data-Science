Q:

Unable to find the executable

I am trying a run  a node on the terminal using the command rosrun skeleton_listener skelCord.cpp (I got the code skelCord.cpp from this link http://answers.ros.org/question/230327/tf-listener-for-openni-tracker-solved/?comment=254098#post-id-254098, "skeleton_listener" is the name of the package). But when I try and run it I get the error
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named skelCord.cpp below /home/eric/catkin_ws/src/skeleton_listener
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/eric/catkin_ws/src/skeleton_listener/src/skelCord.cpp

If anyone knows why this error occurs their help would be greatly appreciated.

A:

You can't directly run .cpp files, you'll have to compile them first. Probably as part of a package, in a catkin workspace.

@gvdhoorn thank you for the answer, isn't compiling done using catkin_make, because I have already done catkin_make in the workspace.

Ok. So what did you add to CMakeLists.txt and package.xml in order to get the node to compile properly?
Comment by fundamentals on 2017-02-08:
@gvdhoorn I added this to the end of the Cmakelists.txt
1. find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS std_msgs tf )
2. add_executable(skelCord src/skelCord.cpp)
3. target_link_libraries(skelCord ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
I didn't add  to the package.xml  but its dependecies are std_msgs rospy roscpp

Ok. Then after sourceing the setup.bash, you should be able to run:
rosrun skeleton_listener skelCord

Note that I didn't include the .cpp extension, as that is not included in the binary name in your CMakeLists.txt either.
