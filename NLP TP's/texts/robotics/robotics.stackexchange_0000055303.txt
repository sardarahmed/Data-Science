Q:

catkin check runtime dependency

Does this exist?
The use case is packages which provide cmake/xxx-extras.cmake files. An obvious example is the message_generation macros throwing a warning/error if you didn't run_depend on message_runtime, but there are similar cases where a build_depend package provides a macro which does something in a dependent package that will then need some other run_depend.

A:

Are you referring to the following error message of catkin: https://github.com/ros/catkin/blob/groovy-devel/cmake/catkin_package.cmake#L214 ?
It uses the CMake variable ${PROJECT_NAME}_RUN_DEPENDS which is available after you invoked catkin_package() (or catkin_package_xml()). It provides all the keys for run_depend from the package.xml file.
