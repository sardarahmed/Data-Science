Q:

URDF Link Mesh File Locations

Is it true that the mesh files for URDF links must reside on each machine using the robot? For example, the mesh files for turtlebot must reside both on the netbook and the workstation running rviz. If this is true I think this fact should be added here http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/XML/Link under the mesh heading.

A:

I believe that is true. The mesh information is never communicated in any message (AFAIK), rather just the filename (using the package syntax) is communicated.

That would be very helpful.

Should I add it to the wiki because it's not completely clear?
