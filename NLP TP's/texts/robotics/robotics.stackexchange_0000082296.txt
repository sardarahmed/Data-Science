Q:

Get 403 Forbidden when downloading indigo packages from package.ros.org

Recently I got error '403 Forbidden' messages when I use '$ apt-get install' to install most indigo packages, when I visit the website http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r directly, I found that I get 403 forbidden only when I try to download indigo packages, packages for kinetic or jade or other distro are totally accessible.
I wonder if it is a server error or it's just my Internet doesn't works fine(I'm in China, BTW), I don't think I would blame it on the system's settings since I can't download those packages form Windows System, either. Error messages are listed below, Help me please!

A:

I'll try to find an earlier Q&A that I've seen about a similar question, but for now: it could well be that there is a proxy or firewall between you and packages.ros.org that is interfering with your network traffic. We've seen that before.
What you could perhaps try is to see whether any of the mirrors in China do work. See wiki/ROS/Installation/UbuntuMirrors for the global list of mirrors.

Thanks for quick reply! I managed to download the packages after I update the source.list! I have actually tried that in Software & Updates before, seems that not every mirror works properly, but I do have solved the problem this time! Thanks again!

If there really is a problem with one of the mirrors, you should tell us. Perhaps something can be done about it.
But as I wrote earlier, we've seen instances where proxies and / or firewalls interfere with network traffic, resulting in the sort of strange problems that you report.
