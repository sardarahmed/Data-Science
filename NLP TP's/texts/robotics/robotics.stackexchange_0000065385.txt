Q:

How can I install Hydro and Indigo alongside on Ubuntu 14.04

I installed indigo resourcefully.PR2 is supported only for Hydro.I tried installing hydro by following official doc  (http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu)
I get following error
$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-desktop-full

I have also run apt-get update cmd before running above command

A:

See some of the other answers: Hydro is not supported on Ubuntu 14.04, so you cannot apt-get it. See also REP-0003.
One way to get Hydro on Ubuntu Trusty is to build it from source. But I would only do this if you know what you are doing, as it is (can be) far from trivial. Another way could be to use a chroot. The ROS wiki has an example (see Installing ROS Indigo in a chroot): you could attempt that but with Precise and Hydro. But just as for the source install, if you don't know what you are doing, it is most likely easier to get a second machine and install Precise and Hydro on it directly.
