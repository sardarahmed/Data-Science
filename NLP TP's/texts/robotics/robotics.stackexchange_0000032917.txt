Q:

rviz crash after latest ros update?

Hi,
I am using ROS diamondback on lucid, after the latest pkg update I cannot start rviz on several machines (all using nvidia grahpics cards). I do get the follwing error:
$ rosrun rviz rviz
Failed to initialize Ogre: OGRE EXCEPTION(7:InternalErrorException): Could not load dynamic library Plugin_CgProgramManager.  System Error: Plugin_CgProgramManager.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in DynLib::load at /tmp/buildd/ros-diamondback-visualization-common-1.4.1/debian/ros-diamondback-visualization-common/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-1/OgreMain/src/OgreDynLib.cpp (line 91)
[ERROR] [1310418311.062274513]: Caught exception while loading: OGRE EXCEPTION(7:InternalErrorException): Could not load dynamic library Plugin_CgProgramManager.

Does anyone have an idea what's going on here?
Thanks in advance
Georg

When you say packages do you mean deb packages?

A:

after trying to install electric today, I found out that I was still using earlier days code.ros.org as deb source and not the packages.ros.org, this obviously lead to incomplete updates and therefore I did not get the rviz updates that solved the problem.
