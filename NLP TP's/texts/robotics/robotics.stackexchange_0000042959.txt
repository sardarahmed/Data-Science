Q:

ActionClient in Rosjava

Hi,
I read that actionlib isn't yet supported with the latest release of rosjava. Is there an alternative to specify, using code and not rviz, a target location to a base that is running tha navigation stack?
Thank you in advance!

A:

You could always write a small proxy in another language that supports actionlib. For example: https://code.google.com/p/parsec/source/browse/#hg%2Fnavigation_waypoints_server
