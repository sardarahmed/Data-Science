Q:

rosbag time slicing?

Is there a tool for slicing a bag file by time (e.g. cut out 30m of data from the middle of a bag)? Or does everyone just use a filter over the timestamps?

A:

I don't know about such a tool. With rxbag you can export parts of a bag file though. Another way would be to write a simple python script that uses the rosbag python API. Shouldn't be too much code and it should be pretty similar to the first example in the rosbag cookbook.

How do you export part of the bag with rxbag? That was my intuition as well, but I couldn't find the feature...

Mark a region on the timeline, above the marker for the current position, right-click and select 'copy region to bag'
