Q:

TF2 how to translate vector in Python?

Hi everyone,
I think I'm experiencing a severe blackout right now...
A short one: in Python, how do I translate a 3D vector (a numpy array) from one TF2 frame to another considering position and orientation of the reference frames?
Thanks

A:

Figured it out myself: by using tf2_geometry_msgs.do_transform_vector3 and its respective siblings for geometry_msgs/Point and so on.

lookup a transform for the desired coordinate transformation
create the point/vector you want to translate
do_transform_point/vector on the point/vector
returns the original point/vector in the new coordinate frame
...
profit!
