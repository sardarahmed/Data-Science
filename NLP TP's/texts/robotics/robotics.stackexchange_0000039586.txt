Q:

Error trying to install gazebo_worlds

Hello,
I'm trying to install gazebo on Fedora 15 following the instructions here:
Starting Gazebo
I've followed all the beginner tutorials and ROS worked fine, so I assume it's correctly installed.
When I try to install gazebo I get the following error:
[manu@manu simulator_gazebo]$ rosdep install gazebo_worlds
Failed to find rosdep eigen for package gazebo_worlds on OS:fedora version:15
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install eigen

I couldn't find an answer related to this... does somebody know how to solve this dependency?

A:

The rosdep rules for eigen are missing.  See the rosdep tutorial for adding one.

Many Thanks tfoote!
I added this lines to the rosdep.yaml file:
eigen:
fedora: eigen3-devel
And now the eigen package was successfully installed :)
