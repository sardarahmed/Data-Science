Q:

dynamic_reconfigure is not working with Diamondback

Hello,
I'm trying to put dynamic_reconfigure package to my node.
But when I create a new node with the following tutorial, http://www.ros.org/wiki/dynamic_reconfigure/Tutorials/SettingUpDynamicReconfigureForANode , It doesn't publish any topic.
For the example on the dynamic_reconfigure package(testserver) also doesn't work. It just stops then I should press "Ctrl+" to quit the process.
Is there anyone who encounter this problem?
Cheers.

A:

It works the different machine which has exact same version of ROS and Linux.
ROS is diamond back, version 1.4.6
Linux is Ubuntu 10.04, Kernel version 2.6.35-28
Is there anyone who knows about this problem?
Cheers.

PS it's better to update your question than to answer it, unless you consider it closed.

Can you look a little closer at the differences between the two machines?  There must be something.
