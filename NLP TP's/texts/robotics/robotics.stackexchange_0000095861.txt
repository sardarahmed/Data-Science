Q:

Why rclcpp_action create_client cannot choose qos options?

Hi everyone, I'm trying to understand the actionlib of ROS2. I have a question as title... (Hope this question not too stupid)
In rclcpp_action create_action, user can choose which qos they want but why in rclcpp_action create_client doesn't have this function?
Please kindly help me. Many thanks!!!

I don't think that's a stupid question, from a 3 minute glance to try to answer your question, I couldn't find a good answer to that either.

Thank you! I just afraid that I didn't read ROS2 Documents carefully.

A:

The action server and action client implementations were contributed independently, so I think this is just something that was overlooked. Feel free to open up an issue (or even better, a pull request) for adding the API.
Note, because it will involve changing API, it will have to target a release after Foxy.
