Q:

a global and local map question

In the image below there are two blue crest. If I toggle off the global map panel then the right one disappears.  If I toggle off the local map panel then the left one disappears. My global static map in the map server is blank so the image is real-time! Why are these not aligned?
rosmap.yaml  for map server

You should add how you configured your costmaps, especially their origins and staticness.

I updated question with this information,

A:

The local map should not be configured to use the static map.

please see http://answers.ros.org/question/93686/preplexing-local-cost-map-problem/
i will close this but it right now it is the only way I have of running. OK.just tested if I just keep DWA off the static map can be off also and it will move forward.
