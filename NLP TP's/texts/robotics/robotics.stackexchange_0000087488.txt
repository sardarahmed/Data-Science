Q:

How to migrate tf data types such as Quaternion, Vector3, Transform to tf2?

There is not much mentioned about tf2 datatypes on tf2_ros documentation at http://docs.ros.org/latest/api/tf2_ros/html/c++/.
While comparing to http://docs.ros.org/latest/api/tf/html/c++/, we don't have any data types mentioned. My C++ code has plenty of tf datatypes such as
 tf::Quaternion q(msg->pose[index].orientation.x,
                msg->pose[index].orientation.y,
                msg->pose[index].orientation.z,
                msg->pose[index].orientation.w);

 tf::Transform transform;
    

How will I migrate them to tf2_ros?

A:

Please see the Supported Datatypes section of the tf2 wiki.
The tf::Quaternion is a fork of the Bullet btQuaternion which will be your easiest conversion.
