Q:

Unable to locate package ros-lunar-desktop-full

I have this ubuntu:
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 17.10
Release:    17.10
Codename:   artful

I have followed everything from the page [Ubuntu install of ROS Lunar][1].
I did everything on this page, but when I do:

sudo apt-get install ros-lunar-desktop-full

I get the following message:
Unable to locate package ros-lunar-desktop-full

Is there something I can check to find why it isn't finding the package?
I have added mirrors from Ireland, Germany and Netherlands but it cannot locate the package.

The REP is explicit about this, but it's also stated on the wiki page @VansFannel linked to. Under Ubuntu install of ROS Lunar there is no mention of Artful anywhere.
