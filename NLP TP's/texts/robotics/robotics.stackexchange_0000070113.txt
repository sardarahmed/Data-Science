Q:

Possible software missmatch (Arduino Uno)

When trying to run the rosserial tutorials (blink for example: [http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Blink]) I receive the following error:
$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM1
[INFO] [WallTime: 1446076253.296082] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime: 1446076253.301507] Connecting to /dev/ttyACM1 at 57600 baud
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1446076270.407976] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

I have updated rosserial to the indigo version (which I run) using the zip file availible through github [https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/tree/indigo-devel], regenerated the libraries, and retested in accordance with this very similar problem's solution [http://answers.ros.org/question/196204/unable-to-sync-with-device-arduino-uno/]. However, the problem persists.
Any ideas as to what I should try next? Any suggestions are appreciated!

A:

We ran a full set of system updates for our ROS using laptop, and the problem disappeared.
