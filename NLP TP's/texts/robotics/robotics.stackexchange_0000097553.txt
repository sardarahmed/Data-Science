Q:

Unable to install ROS TurtleBOT - Unable to locate package

My OS :
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
Release: 20.04
Codename: focal
My ROS
/rosdistro: noetic
/rosversion: 1.15.8

When I try to intall turtlebot packages using this
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps ros-indigo-turtlebot-interactions ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator ros-indigo-kobuki-ftdi ros-indigo-rocon-remocon ros-indigo-rocon-qt-library ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar-msgs

I get this Error :
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot-interactions
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-kobuki-ftdi
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-rocon-remocon
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-rocon-qt-library
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar-msgs

Even if I change the distro to kinetic or noetic , that still produces the same error messages with given distro name.
Why is this happening? Kindly help ASAP.

A:

You are trying to install indigo packages when your ROS distro is noetic (as it should be under Ubuntu focal). You need to find and install the corresponding noetic packages instead. The turtlebot packages doesn't seem to exist anymore in noetic, so I think you will need to use http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot3 instead.
