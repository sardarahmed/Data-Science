Q:

is there anyway to fuse 2d lidar readings and camera reading in ros

Hi i am using a 2d lidar tilted at an angle such that it hits the ground and we are also using a mono-cam for detection of objects (static etc) . Is there any way that i can fuse these two reading i.e the lidar readings onto the camera readings so that i can measure the dist of object through this fuse data(width and x,y positions of the boundaries)
