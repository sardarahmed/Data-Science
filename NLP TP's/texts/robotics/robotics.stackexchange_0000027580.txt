Q:

Is there an existing model for a ball on beam system?

Hello everyone, I have a couple of hours next week that I was planning to spend with our favorite simulation framework.
Before I started though, I wanted to check if there already was an existing model of a ball on beam, or a ball on plate system.
If not, I was going to follow Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch assuming that still is how things are built in Gazebo these days.

Hey SL REmy, did you build up a ball on plate system in gazebo and would you like to share  it??! 2f4yor@gmail.com

A:

I don't know of an existing beam-on-ball system, or ball on plate system.
You can use URDF to create such a system, but I would recommend using SDF  (here is a relevant tutorial). With SDF you can contribute your model into Gazebo's database, and SDF is the default format for Gazebo.
