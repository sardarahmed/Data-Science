Q:

What microcontroller should be used for QuadCopter flight control and ESC?

I am working on building my own quadcopter from scratch. I noticed that many solutions available online use arduino, but I am not a fan of arduino. So my questions are: what microcontrollers should be used, what are the crucial features of those microcontrollers etc. I would like to build it from total scratch. I was thinking about PIC microcontrollers.
Also what should be used for ESC, since I would build that from scratch too.
Summing it all up:

4 ESCs

Gyro,acceloremeter,gps

transceiver
which is about 8 slaves and one master microcontroller.

A:

You're asking about microcontrollers, but I get the sense that you're asking it for the wrong reasons.  Since you don't list a technical reason for being "not a fan of arduino", I get the sense that you're trying to make a quadcopter that is different in every way from existing solution.  This decision sounds at best arbitrary and at worst misguided.  Why doesn't arduino fit your needs?  What are your needs?
If many quadcopter designs are using arduino, that's a good indication that arduino is a useful element of getting quadcopters to work.  There may be a better microcontroller to use, but how will you know what to look for until you experience firsthand a shortcoming in the arduino platform?
If your desire is to make a quadcopter from scratch, the best way to approach it is not to conceive the design from first principles.  Take an existing design, study it, and improve it once you understand how it works.  It will take a lot of prototypes, trial, and especially error.
