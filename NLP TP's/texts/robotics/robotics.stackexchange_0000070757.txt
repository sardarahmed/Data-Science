Q:

Bag file with Karto

Hi friend.
I have a bag file and I run this bag file with gMapping, without any problem. Now, I want to run(autonom) this same bag file with KartoMapping(nav2d_karto). So, how can I do this?
Thanks for your help...

A:

The same as with gmapping.
Create a launch file (take care about topic remappings), configure karto (take care about the frame ids), and go.
Afaik, the only thing karto needs is a laser scan and the tf from odom to base_link (or whatever you configure it to be)... So the exact same thing as  gmapping...

Hey mig! You are really good man.
I glanced /karto_out topic and MultiMapper.cpp. So MultiMapper.cpp so complex. I didn't understand methods :)
What did you mean "configure karto"? Add or remove some code to the MultiMapper.cpp? Or you mean only tf transform?

well, there are parameter/config files (yaml files). This is the configuration. Check out the example launch and config files here
