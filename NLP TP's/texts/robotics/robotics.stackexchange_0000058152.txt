Q:

Is possible to use Ros with pic32 microcontroller?

HI
I have a pic32 ethernet kit microcontroller, and i want connect it with another pic32 and  with the master in a pc using ROS and the protocol TCP/IP. Is it possible?
I read that there are the rosserial package and the rosc library, but i don't understand how they work, so if is possible  what 's the better solution?

I have used the rosserial with ardunino and it works great.  The code is written in C.  You can use tcp/ip with PIC perhaps ROS bridge.

Are you sure that with rosserial i can send using json?

A:

Rosserial is sending receiving and sending ros topics or messages.  The message will need a ros header on it but could be a string of some length that contains your json information you are trying to convey.  Ros serial is like ros bridge but connects to a serial line.  Ros bridge uses tcp/ip but once again it is I think a ros topic message and above applys to it.
