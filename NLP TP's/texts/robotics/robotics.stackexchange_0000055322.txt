Q:

rqt_reconfigure resets parameters on startup

Hi,
I had serious problems with saving and loading parameter while using rqt_reconfigure. To find my problem I broke the code down to the following:

Start the node with the dynamic_reconfigure server
rosparam set /node_name/myparam 42
rosparam get /node_name/myparam (returns 42 and everything works)
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
rosparam get /node_name/myparam (returns value saved in .cfg file)

I do not know why rqt_reconfigure does that. I also checked out its wiki page and as far as I see it should read the values from the parameter server and not set them back to the default from the .cfg file. I am lost.

A:

I was just trolling through and found this question, which is a little old. Hopefully this info will be useful to someone.
I found this issue when I took over maintenance a couple of months ago, and fixed it soon after. Please try pulling the latest version of rqt_reconfigure from rqt_common_plugins at https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins
The fix is not in the current release, but will certainly be in the next one.
