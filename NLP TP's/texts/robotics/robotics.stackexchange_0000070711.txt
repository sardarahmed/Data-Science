Q:

estimate covariance of a matrix

Hi, im implementing regularized particle filter. My particle has coordinate x,y,z. All particles would make up a matrix n by 3 matrix . i wonder is there any existing code to find covariance matrix of a matrix in c++ somewhere in ros . This is easily done by matlab but c++ is too complicated

A:

I'm unaware of a "ROS" way of doing this, but if you are using C++, I'd recommend using Eigen. It is easily installed and used extensively by many ROS packages. If you're using a ROS Indigo or Jade, you'll need to depend on the cmake_modules package to get catkin to build your code (see these instructions).
If you're using Eigen, there are easy ways to calculate covariance using built-in Eigen matrix functions. For a few examples, see this Stack Overflow post.

thanks so much, the library is good but it is still so slow as the matrix is big, is there anyway to speed it up

@dmngu9 so you want to say that it is much slower in Eigen than in Matlab? sounds suspicious
