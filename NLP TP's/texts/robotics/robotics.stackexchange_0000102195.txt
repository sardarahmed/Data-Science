Q:

where to suggest ideas

Hi, I started developing stuff using ROS2 about a month ago. If I have an idea for a ROS package, where would be the appropriate place be to discuss it and garner support? I am thinking of making a higher-level API over rclpy that is more beginner friendly.

A:

Hi, you can open a discussion on ROS Discourse. This will be the best way to gather attention about your package, and also to obtain feedback/input that might be helpful for you to continue improving it.
There is a category called ROS Projects, that you might particularly find interesting
