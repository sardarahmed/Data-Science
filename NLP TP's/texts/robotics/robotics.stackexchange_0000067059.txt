Q:

Why is the step to download the KinectSensor binaries needed?

Are these not available as Debian packages?
I see a few Debian ros-indigo packages relating to kinect, but I'm not sure which ones are needed.

A:

It depends on which Kinect you have. Some of the newer Kinects need these different drivers.
