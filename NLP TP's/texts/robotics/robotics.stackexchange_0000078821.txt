Q:

Gazebo: Could not load controller, JointTrajectoryController does not exist (Mastering ROS chapter 10)

Hi!
I am new in ROS, and I was reading a book "Mastering ROS".
But I am having an issue with loading controllers in Gazebo, from chapter 10. Working with perception using MoveIt! and Gazebo. Even though I just copied code from the repo. (Actually, the same issue appeared on chapter 3 or 4).
Logs are following:
[ERROR] [1486485132.488395779, 0.283000000]: Could not load controller 'seven_dof_arm_joint_controller' because controller type 'position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController' does not exist.
[ERROR] [1486485132.488718126, 0.283000000]: Use 'rosservice call controller_manager/list_controller_types' to get the available types

[ERROR] [1486485133.520919999, 0.566000000]: Could not load controller 'gripper_controller' because controller type 'position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController' does not exist.

[ERROR] [1486485134.523407, 1.095000]: Failed to load gripper_controller

I think, it is because I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 and Kinetic, whereas in the book the system was 14.04 and Indigo.
How can I resolve this issue? Any ideas?
EDIT1: I changed some urdf files because I had same issue as here
UPD: I've resolved it by installing all available controllers: sudo apt-get install ros*controller*
I know, it is not the right way, but somehow I couldn't find anywhere that I can install joint controller itself sudo apt-get ros-kinetic-joint-trajectory-controller. Maybe it was too obvious. I found it in the new packages list when I ran the command above.
The following NEW packages will be installed: ros-kinetic-bhand-controller ros-kinetic-diff-drive-controller ros-kinetic-dynamixel-controllers ros-kinetic-dynamixel-driver ros-kinetic-dynamixel-msgs ros-kinetic-dynamixel-sdk ros-kinetic-dynamixel-workbench-controllers ros-kinetic-dynamixel-workbench-msgs ros-kinetic-dynamixel-workbench-toolbox ros-kinetic-force-torque-sensor-controller ros-kinetic-gripper-action-controller ros-kinetic-imu-sensor-controller ros-kinetic-joint-trajectory-controller ros-kinetic-kobuki-controller-tutorial ros-kinetic-md49-base-controller ros-kinetic-md49-messages ros-kinetic-md49-serialport ros-kinetic-nav-pcontroller ros-kinetic-robot-controllers ros-kinetic-robot-controllers-interface ros-kinetic-robot-controllers-msgs ros-kinetic-robotis-controller-msgs ros-kinetic-ros-controllers ros-kinetic-rqt-controller-manager ros-kinetic-rqt-joint-trajectory-controller ros-kinetic-velocity-controllers ros-kinetic-view-controller-msgs ros-kinetic-yocs-diff-drive-pose-controller ros-kinetic-yocs-safety-controller
Thanks!

A:

Maybe, it is not the right way, because you don't really find a missing dependency in this way.
But somehow I couldn't find anywhere that I can just install joint controller itself:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joint-trajectory-controller

If this is really a problem with the way the package(s) list their dependencies (and thus make rosdep not work), it would be nice if you could report that on the issue tracker of the book.

I see, thanks!

It works, thank you.

This answer works but why do I install all these controllers?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-10-07:
You don't need to install all controllers. Just the ones that are used.
