Q:

Should one or multiple controller_manager nodes be used for modular robots (e.g. base + arm)? [ros2_control]

If you have a robot composed of several sub-robots (e.g. a mobile base platform with a manipulator attached), each of which has its own independent controllers defined, is there a preferred approach to managing the controllers for the combination?
Are there reasons for or against either:

aggregating the controllers for both the base and arm into a single controller_manager node, or
running separate controller_manager nodes for each sub-robot (e.g. base_controller_manager and arm_controller_manager)?

I'd imagine the former might have a bit less overhead, but the latter might make lifecycle management a bit more flexible?

A:

Here are some things to think about:

If everything is included in one controller_manager, then all controllers will spin at the same rate. That may or may not be OK. The spin rate is determined by the update_rate parameter.

If you have 2 controller_managers, then using the command line for querying controller stuff gets more tricky. You can't use ros2 control list_controllers, for example -- IIRC you have to specify which controller manager.
