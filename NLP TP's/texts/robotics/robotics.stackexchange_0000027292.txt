Q:

Gazebo5 ROS packages?

Are there plans to release gazebo5 packages for ROS Indigo (i.e. ros-indigo-gazebo5-*)?

A:

After speak with Steve, Nate and the rest of the team, we have released the ROS Wrappers for Gazebo5. Only for ROS Indigo. I've created a pull request to update the tutorial.
  # if you have the packages.osrfoundation.org repository:  
  sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo5-ros-pkgs

ROS Jade will bring support out-of-the-box for gazebo5 and gazebo_ros_pkgs.
