Q:

Include a rotation Axis to Turtlebot

Hi, I'm trying to modify the turtlebot model to add a rotation axis to the kinect camera to move it like a type of neck or something like that but I don't know exactly if I need to change the type of the joint of the kinect camera on turtlebot_description files

No worries Tully. I thought that this was a very good question to answer because it is very common to decide to add a rotating joint here or there in the robot, but it is not trivial how to do that in the simulation so the joint can be controlled properly.

A:

The question was closed while I was preparing a complete answer. Basically, what you need is to change the type of joint that ties the Kinect to the Turtlebot structure from fixed to continuous. Then you need to add the controller for the joint. Video showing how to: https://youtu.be/Y5K4gF2teIA
