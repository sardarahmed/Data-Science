Q:

Error using sound_play package

I am trying to learn something by using the ALICE code to let it able to speak. I follow the instruction given by the books "Learning robotic using python" in chapter 8. But I have problem on making it speak and also speech recognition.
To make it speak, I am using sound_play package in ROS. Due to the problem, I tested it with:
> roslaunch sound_play soundplay_node.launch

Then it come out with error as follow:

.. logging to

A:

You have the package cloned into your workspace. The error message is saying, that the message file for python cannot be found. This file is auto-generated once you compile your Workspace.
I guess you just have to call a catkin_make (or catkin build, whatever build command you use), and if this compiles successfully, you are good to go...
