Q:

how do i change topic name for ar_pose?

By default, ar_pose package looks for Image data published by usb_cam, but I would like it to look for Image data published by a different node (ar_drone).  Is there a way to change the topic source without hacking the source code for ar_pose?
I notice that ar_kinect must do something similar.
