Q:

urdf_to_collada undefined reference to vtable for Assimp::IOSystem

I'm working on getting ROS and the robot variant packages setup on an armhf port of Ubuntu. About 40 of the 100 robot variant packages have built just fine, however I'm having trouble with the collada_urdf package.
More specifically, when it is trying to link the urdf_to_collada executable the linker is complaining that collada_urdf.so has an unresolved dependency for IOSystem's vtable. With Assimp being a system package, I'm not sure how to go about resolving this problem.
I've tried reordering the libraries in urdf_to_collada's link.txt file to no avail.

This issue also appears while compiling indigo on an odroid-xu using the standard ubuntu 14.04 image, applying the patch from bit-pirate seems to fix this,  hopefully this saves someone else a couple hours

A:

I know this question is old, but I think I found the answer :)
The problem is that it does not detect the correct assimp version. vi into src/collada_urdf/src/collada_urdf.cpp and write #define IS_ASSIMP3 at the top of the file. Also make sure you actually have assimp3 installed. You can download the source here

I was able to compile collada_urdf from source without any changes (but had to assimp3 as suggested). Thanks for the tip!

I opened an new issue here: https://github.com/ros/collada_urdf/issues/9
The other issues are closed which makes them hard to find
