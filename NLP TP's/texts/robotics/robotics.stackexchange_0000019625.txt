Q:

Definition of robotics manipulator?

I'm new to robotics, I don't understand the way wikipedia defines robotics manipulator. If there is no any direct contact how could the robot move things within his work envelope.

In robotics a manipulator is a device used to manipulate materials
  without direct contact

source robotics manipulator

A:

The original manipulators referred to in that article were through-the-wall pantographs which moved radioactive materials without the human operator having direct contact with those materials.  The end effectors of those manipulators did have direct contact with the materials - just not the human.  Although the article is not specific about this, it seems they carry that concept forward for programmable manipulators - that the person doing (or supervising) the task does not engage the product directly.
