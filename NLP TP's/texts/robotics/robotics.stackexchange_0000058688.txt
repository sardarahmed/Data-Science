Q:

How can I simulate a laser sensor without hardware?

Hello everyone
I have downloaded hokuyo_node-hydro-devel in GitHub,and I want to simulate it in Gazebo or rviz. First I don't konw if Gazebo or rviz meet the requirements,which one should I choose? My Ubuntu is 12.04.Then,how to simulate the hokuyo sensor without hardware?Because Ijust want to see how the sensor works, make sure what I downloaded is what I need,then I can use the sensor somewhere else as a library.

A:

Gazebo is what you would use for simulation, rviz is only for displaying data.
However, this only simulates a laser with similar features. It will not simulate a physical hokuyo that you can virtually connect to. So you will not need the hokuyo_node at all. That is only for physical sensors. The interface for a laser is usually only messages.

What you mean is that if I want to run hokuyo_node,I must connect physical sensors.Is it right?              And now how can I simulate a laser with similar features?

You would use a plugin in gazebo that acts as a laser by sending the same message. See e.g. http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/ROS_Motor_and_Sensor_Plugins
