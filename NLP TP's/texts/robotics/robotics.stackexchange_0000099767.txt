Q:

Publish Float64MultiArray from command line - ROS2

I can't seem to figure this out:
ros2 topic pub /gripper_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray lay  [TAB COMPLETE]
Now the message is auto-populated like this. I just change the data field:
ros2 topic pub /gripper_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray layout:\
\ \ dim:\ []\
\ \ data_offset:\ 0\
data:\ [0.2]\

^ When I try that, the error is:

yaml.scanner.ScannerError: mapping
values are not allowed here   in
"", line 1, column 13:
layout:  dim: []  data_offset: 0data: [0.2]

Similar issues if I use the rqt message publisher.

Ah, found an example in ros2_control_demos:
ros2 topic pub /gripper_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "data:
- 0.1"
