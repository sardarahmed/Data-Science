Q:

changing point cloud color in rviz

Hi all,
I am using RVIZ to visualize the point clouds I have obtained after applying certain methods, I am trying to visualize it along with the original point cloud but in different color, but I am unable to get different color even if I set the color of different point clouds. I am using latest version of RVIZ, please help me in getting the solution so that I can set the color of clouds. The color of grid and axes can be visualize easily.
Thanking You.

I apologize, my fault. It was the ros-users list.

It was also posted to ros-users. As a question specific to rviz, it makes sense here. I'm not sure what it has to do with OpenCV...

This is a duplicate. The issue has been posted on the OpenCV mailing list as well.

A:

You should have the color transformer set to flat and then be able to choose a color for the pointcloud in rviz.
