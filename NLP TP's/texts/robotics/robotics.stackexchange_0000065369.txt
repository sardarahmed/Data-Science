How to transmit images from a camera?

Hi, I intend to public images from a wifi camera on a topic, i tried to use usb_cam but I think it does not support wifi, so i tried to download the gscam package but it is not available for indigo, what should I try? any ideas?

Isn't this a duplicate of How do I capture images from a wifi camera??

actually no, I found out that gscam was the right tool, but it is not available for indigo, i am asking if anyone knows a way to publish images from a wifi camera on a topic similar to gscam, or at least a package that allows me to do that, it can be so difficult but i do not get any answers

i am new at this, could you please explain my how to do that? thanks a lot

A:

Afaict, gscam just hasn't been released for Indigo, but that doesn't mean you can't build it yourself. According to gscam/issues/17, it should compile and work fine.

Edit: In general the process to build from source is something like:
mkdir -p $HOME/your/catkin_ws/src
cd $HOME/your/catkin_ws/src

git clone http://url/to/git/repository.git

cd $HOME/your/catkin_ws
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

# do what rosdep wants you to do (but use common sense, obviously)
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src

catkin_make

See also catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace. And replace $HOME/your/catkin_ws and http://url/to/git/repository.git with the real path and URL.
note: I have not tested this for gscam, but the process should be similar. It could be that gscam needs some tweaks/fixes to build under Indigo.
If you haven't, I recommend you follow the ROS tutorials, as that will familiarise you with much of the terminology and commands, and make things like follow up tutorials (and the Answers on this site) much easier to understand.

It seems to work properly thanks a lot, However still i get errors when i try to recieve images from a wifi camera [..]

Edit2: If the gscam pkg builds and runs, then you would probably need to figure out what the exact GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable is you need to access your phone's camera. See wiki.ros.org/gscam for more information. You should be able to use any tutorial on Gstreamer to figure out how to exactly configure it, and use that knowledge to configure gscam.

( i ve been trying with my phone connected as a cam)

If it is an Android device, you might be interested in the ROS Android Sensors Driver. You can just install that on your phone, and start streaming images. No need for gscam.

However still i get errors when i try to recieve images from a wifi camera( i ve been trying with my phone connected as a cam) maybe it would work with a normal wifi camera?
