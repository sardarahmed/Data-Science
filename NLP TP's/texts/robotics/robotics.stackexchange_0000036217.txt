Q:

Downloading a package

Hello,
I am new with ROS, so I think this question is easy to answer, but I haven't found it in FAQ.
I am trying to download the kinect_camera package, from this site:
http://ros.org/wiki/kinect_camera
The problem is that the source address is not like all other packages I've seen. The source address is:
bzr lp:cyphy   or   lp:cyphy
I usually type (to download a package):
svn co 
and this works with a normal address (eg. http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_unstable/pcl    for a pcl package)
What should I do to download the kinect_camera package? I use Ubuntu.
Thank you in advanced, if the question was already answer please forgive me, I didn't found it.
Dani

Hi,
There are different version controls like hg, svn, bzr etc. Bazaar is the version control you are talking about. The command for checking out from bzr is
bzr checkout <https://link> <local_directory_path>

you can google to know more about this version control.
Hope this helps,
Karthik
