Q:

Executing a 32bit ROS App in a 64bit uBuntu OS

I wanted to install ROS 32bit and ROS 64bit in the same machine. That it appears wont fly. I then compiled my 32bit App in a separate 32bit machine (with 32bit ROS under a 32bit uBuntu PC).
I'm now trying to run my 32bit App in the 64bit environment (that is, 64bit fuerte and 64bit uBuntu). Launching it from a launch file (this is the syntax: "")
I get this error:
"ERROR: cannot launch node of type [foo_bar/foo_bar]: can't locate node [foo_bar] in package [foo_bar]"
ROSCD foo_bar navigates to the correct path. So it is not that ROS can't see the binary file.
What am I missing?

I have added the set(ROS_BUILD_STATIC_LIBS, true) command on my CMakelist file, but still no change.

A:

This is at the moment not possible. I eventually installed the chroot environment and added i386 Precise and Fuerte on it. I then built and ran my application from there.
