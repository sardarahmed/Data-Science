Q:

This website does not know Turkish Language :(

Let's be honest! translate.google.com 's Turkish is not good.
I would like to translate the ROS Website and Documentation. But how will reach you with translations?

Your question is not clear. Do you mean, how you will give the turkish translated website for integration with English Version of ROS website??

A:

A Turkish translation would be a great contribution.  So far, there are partial Korean and Japanese translations.  Seems like a Turkish translation should live at http://www.ros.org/wiki/tr.

You need to create an account for the wiki first and log in.
