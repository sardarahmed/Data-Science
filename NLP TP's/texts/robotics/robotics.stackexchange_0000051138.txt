Q:

Driving the robot up a ramp

Hello
I wont to do some test with my platform. My platform is an electrical wheelchair and I wont to calculate some parameters during the driving. I wont to drive it up and down a ramp and I wont to know how to calculate when the platform is up or down the ramp. So I will start in some point (horizontal level) and drive up the rmp till the end. So how to calculate that??
Thanks

Very interesting !

So any help????

A:

Assuming you have an IMU, look at the pitch angle:

should be below a flat surface threshold, e.g. 5°
wait until above threshold for ramp angle, e.g. 20° -> on ramp
wait until below flat surface threshold, e.g. 5° -> off ramp

It's basically like a Schmitt-Trigger if you are familiar with that.

yeas, but IMU is very drifted, Only based on  IMU will not give such accurate results
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-05-15:
is it possible to use the pose from Hactor mapping or amcl that has a pitch component?
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-05-15:
I have a map of the environment so want to use the pose for that purspose

You have a very crappy IMU than I think. A simple accelerometer should be able to correctly measure the angle of the gravity vector.

The pitch angle of an IMU should not have drift.
