Q:

Simulate camera with stage + rviz?

Hi,
I was able to follow this tutorial successfully (simulating one robot with stage + rviz), so my next step would be, how could I simulate a camera in the robot?
I can add it in rviz, but there's no image source for it to be found. Is there any way I can include it somehow?
Thanks,

A:

Stage is a 2D simulator, so there is no way to simulate a camera. You should try Gazebo instead. There's a tutorial how to add a camera to your URDF here.
