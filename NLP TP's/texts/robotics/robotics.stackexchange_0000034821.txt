ROS Answers SE migration: cram_tutorials

I'm doing the cram_tutorial (EventsCoTeSys-ROS-School Day 4)
And when I do
CL-USER> (ros-load:load-system "cram_tutorials" :cram-pick-and-place)
I have this problem:
component #:APPROACH_TABLE_TOOLS-SRV not found, required by

[Condition of type ASDF:MISSING-DEPENDENCY]
What can I do?
Thanks.
