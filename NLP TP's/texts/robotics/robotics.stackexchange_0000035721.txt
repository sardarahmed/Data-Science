Q:

Can't Find My Include

Hello all,
I have two packages: OpenRAVEROSInterp and myTestROS.
OpenRAVEROSInterp is a little package I developed which connects OpenRAVE and ROS.  It works well and uses a file named ROSRobot.h which contains subscriptions/services to interact with robots in OpenRAVE.  It is stored in
rospackages/OpenRAVEROSInterp/include/OpenRAVEROSInterp/ROSRobot.h
My other package myTestROS is attempting to use ROSRobot.h (just for fun).  It's manifest.xml  has
  
When I run rosmake, I get...
 ...workspace/rospackages/myTestROS/src/TestClass.cpp:36:40: error: OpenRAVEROSInterp/ROSRobot.h: No such file or directory 
Where line 36 is:
#include <OpenRAVEROSInterp/ROSRobot.h>

Could anyone off any suggestions?  Thank you.

A:

You'll need to set some export tags in your package's manifest.xml. See the wikipage on manifests.

@joq Yes I can roscd to it.  @tfoote Interesting, I thought he meant I had to add export flags to myTestROS.  I am interested as to why this is so, I figured the rosmake system would be able to handle includes from other packages.  I will examine the wiki page.  Thank you all for your patience!

@Constantin S This works for tf because it uses the export tags like @Mac said.

Is OpenRAVEROSInterp in your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH? Can you roscd to it?
Comment by Constantin S on 2011-11-15:
How come when you , you can $include<tf/tflistener.h> .  What's the difference with my package?
