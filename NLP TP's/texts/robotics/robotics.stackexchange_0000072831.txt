Q:

Hi guys. I have built ROS from source on my PI 2 but I am unable to import libraries

I am not being able to import even the basic libraries such as with from std_msgs import Stringsin my python scripts.
Please help me fix this issue.
EDIT
This is my CMakeLists.txt  :
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(ior_internet)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
rospy
std_msgs
)

catkin_package
(
 ##INCLUDE_DIRS include
 ##LIBRARIES ior_internet
 ##CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp rospy std_msgs
 ##DEPENDS system_lib
)

And this is my package.xml  :
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package>
<name>ior_internet</name>
<version>0.0.0</version>
<description>The ior_internet package</description>

<license>TODO</license>

<buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
<build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
<build_depend>rospy</build_depend>
<build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
<run_depend>roscpp</run_depend>
<run_depend>rospy</run_depend>
<run_depend>std_msgs</run_depend>

</package>

This is not enough information
However, this could be a dependency issue, if you installed everything correctly.
Please post your CMakeLists.txt as well as the package.xml (and also remove any comments, please).

A:

I figured it out. It was because I was not doing #!/usr/bin/env python at the beginning of my scripts. It seems it is important. Now my scripts work as expected.
