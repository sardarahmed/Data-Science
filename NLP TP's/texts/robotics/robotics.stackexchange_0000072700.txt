Q:

Based on uwsim, is it possible to set the friction force of water for the auv? The auv would drift after the thruster was shut down. I want to set a friction force in order to make the auv stop drifting.

Hi,
The friction force with the water (drag) is already simulated. You can change the paremeters modifying the .yaml file. The parameters used are based on the Fossen dynamics model described in guidance and control of ocean vehicles. You can also check the UWSim paper where it is explained.
