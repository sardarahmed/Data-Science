Q:

ROS.org Instructions

Quoting from this page,
 ROS Users: Only install Gazebo from here, and only follow tutorials from this website. Never use the instructions on ros.org. 

Wouldn't it make sense to update the instructions on ros.org as well as on this site?

Just saw that the statement for installing version 1.2, which currently comes with ROS, has been changed as well. This doesn't make sense to me, too. Why should one install Gazebo again, if installation works fine "the ROS way" (apt-get install ros-*-gazebo-simulator)?!

A:

Gazebo is a standalone application that lives outside of ROS. Up to and including G-turtle, ROS has pulled in a specific version of Gazebo in order to maintain ABI and API compatibility with the rest of the ROS ecosystem.
Gazebo will be maintaining ABI and API compatibility, so ROS will transition to using the system install of Gazebo in H-Turtle.
We are telling people to use the standalone version of Gazebo because it is most actively maintained, updated, and tested version.
