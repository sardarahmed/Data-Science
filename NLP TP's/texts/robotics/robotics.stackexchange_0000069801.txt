Q:

hector_exploration_controller publishs twist really slowly

 Hello everyone,
    I try to use `hector_exploration_node` and `hector_exploration_controller` to let robot explore the unknown environment in the stage_ros.
    I simulate the environment by `stage_ros` and create the map by `gmapping` .

    The problem is that I can get the topic `/exploration_path` published by `hector_exploration_node` , but no goals topic . And  there is a trajectory from the robot to the unknown environment .
But the robot only rotate and cant move forward. And the  it costs `hector_exploration_node` 20 more seconds every cycle.

I also find similar problems here.
Here is the rviz.

So , please give me some advice.
Thanks first!

A:

The hector_exploration_controller is meant as a demo showcasing how the exploration approach can be used. It uses a slightly modified version of the path follower originally available in navigation_experimental. For demoing wih a simulated 6 wheel vehicle in Gazebo it worked fine for me, but you might have to play with the parameters a bit. See also this Q/A that seems to describe the same problem.

Stefan, thanks for your answer. My robot is not a wheeled robot but a tracked robot. My colleague wonder if that's the point? Now we try to change the type of twist published by hector_exploration_controller.

Another question is that the tracked robot that Team Hector used in 2015 Robocup Rescue is a automatically one or a half-auto one?
