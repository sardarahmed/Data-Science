Q:

help on install ROS in a MacBook with OSX 10.6.6

I am trying to install ROS in my MacBook OSX 10.6.6.
after doing the command:
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=ros-full&overlay=no"
that appears in "http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/OSX".
I got this output, can anyone give a hint how to solve this issue?

A:

This means that the YAML module for Python was not installed.  Are you sure you ran these steps:
{{{
sudo port install wget cmake python_select subversion mercurial
sudo python_select python26
sudo easy_install -U pyyaml
}}}

I had a similar problem http://answers.ros.org/question/385/problem-with-mac-os-installation-with-yaml. I think what I explained over there is pretty much what one needs to do, since I installed ROS on a fresh install of OS X.
Comment by kwc on 2011-03-16:
I've changed the instructions to use py26-yaml instead.  We probably need better instructions for getting easy_install itself.  My machine is too contaminated to validate proper instructions there.
Comment by tfoote on 2011-03-16:
Should this command be added to the wiki instructions?
Comment by paulo on 2011-03-16:
in the meanwhile I have written the command: sudo port install py26-yaml   . it is now moving :-)
Comment by paulo on 2011-03-16:
yes I have done the steps that you refer. I have done the steps again and not solved the problem. can you help further.
