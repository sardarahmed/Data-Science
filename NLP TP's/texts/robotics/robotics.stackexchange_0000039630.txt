Q:

How to solve 'Failed to find stack for package [pose_follower] & [sbpl_lattice_planner]?

I followed 3d_navigation.
After downloading, I run
  rosmake --rosdep-install 3d_navigation

It shows:
 sam@sam:~/code/ros/navigation/sam_3D_navigation$ rosmake      --rosdep-install 3d_navigation

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

For these particular errors, install the navigation_experimental stack containing the packages pose_follower and sbpl_lattice_planner. If you follow the instructions, just replace "diamondback" with "electric" in the ubuntu package list.
However, there will be more errors after that since there were significant changes in the arm_navigation parts used in 3d_navigation and the code linked in the Wiki is only compatible with diamondback. A version for electric or fuerte is currently worked on.

What you mean is I should wait until 3d_navigation could be installed in /opt? Thank you~
Comment by AHornung on 2012-04-17:
Yes, unless you want to invest much time in patching yourself.
Comment by sam on 2012-04-17:
Is there any schedule for this integration? Thank you~
Comment by AHornung on 2012-04-17:
It's being worked on. You could try what is available at https://kforge.ros.org/Sushi/trac but there is no official release (and no support) yet with the latest (and fastest) implementation.
