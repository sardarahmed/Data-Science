Q:

Lost admin password for geographicinfo_devel@kforge.ros.org

I am the administrator for the Geographic Info devel mailing list. I need to approve a message, but have forgotten the admin password. (I do know my subscription password, but that does not work for admin access.)
I can't figure out how to discover or reset this password.

A:

I somehow missed this post. The list password has been reset, turns out you need to ask an administrator to do that for you, and the ticket closed.

Thanks, Eitan. I did not know who ask about it.
