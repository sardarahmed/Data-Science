A:

Hi,
I'm not sure what the problem is. But I would say is not an issue totally related with UWSim and maybe something is wrong with ros installation. Have you checked the folders actually exist? ( /opt/ros/indigo/share/uwsim ). Have you tried other installed ROS packages?, for instance you can try osg interactive markers which is installed with uwsim.
