Q:

anybody have an unsetup.bash?

Would like to run the opposite of source devel/setup.bash, i.e., unsetup.bash.  Has anyone coded this up already?

A:

no but yes.
If you don't want the environment changes that ROS makes at all, I'd advise that you open a new terminal without sourcing setup.bash
Running the setup.bash from another workspace will unset the changes made by the previous setup.bash. If you really want it you may be able to extract the unset behavior from the setup scripts, but it is fairly complicated
