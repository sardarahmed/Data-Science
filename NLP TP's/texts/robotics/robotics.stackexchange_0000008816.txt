Create 2: Wheel interface board replacement

I'm trying to interface the Roomba's preloaded navigation system with a pair of motors not attached to the roomba itself- however, to do this I need an interface board of the same dimensions as the one pictured in the above document. It has 0.050" (1.27) contact centers, which don't seem to be commercially available. Can anyone provide any help locating PCBs of this size?

A:

Here are a few ideas:

Buy 0.050" spacing prototyping board. For example, here are some possible boards that could work on Digi-Key.
Use a PCB prototyping service and fabricate the board you're looking for; this would have the advantage that you could add other circuits to the panel that you may need for your project.
Remove the boards from the wheel modules and use those. iRobot sells new ones on their website; you might also be able to get them from broken robots on eBay, or perhaps someone at iRobot could help if you e-mail them.

Hope this helps!
