Q:

Tutorial on PR2 simulation in Electric or Fuerte?

Hi,
does someone have experience with running advanced PR2 simulation (pr2_simulator), i.e. door opening or pick and place, using Electric or Fuerte? The tutorials ends with Diamondback. What I am looking for is similar tutorial but for Electric or Fuerte.
Thanks

A:

The tutorial here works with Fuerte using the ros-fuerete-pr2 Ubuntu packages
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_simulator/Tutorials/BasicPR2Controls
Assuming you have set up the ROS environment, e.g.

  source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash

Then running the following commands should bring up a simulation in an
empty world.

  export ROBOT=sim
  roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch

Then you can start keyboard teleop to drive it around

  roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_keyboard.launch

Yeah, I know about this one, however I'm interested in more complicated systems i.e. door opening or pick and place tutorials. I also tried them on diamondback, but the packages which are used in the tutorial are not available.
