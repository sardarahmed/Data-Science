Q:

Pls, recommend me an affordable robot for undergraduage course

Hi,
Are there any small robot platform under USD 4,000 that is suitable to run Knowrob and Cram-System ?
We are going to open a couple of projects for senior undergradute students at my class to build some experience with Knowrob and Cram-System.
Robots in http://wiki.ros.org/Robots are candidates but anyone out there recommend me one or two robots that may fit for our educational goals ?
PR2 and some other systems are too expensive for us, so, I am looking for a small and affordable system that might fit for our students.
Any robots running ROS meets minimum requirements to run Knowrob and Cram-system but not sufficient, aren't they ?
Thanks
Dongho

A:

turtlebot is the first thing that comes to my mind. You can just by the kobuki base and then build the other parts off the shelf.
Another robot is the oculus prime. Its been recently announced and looks promising.
