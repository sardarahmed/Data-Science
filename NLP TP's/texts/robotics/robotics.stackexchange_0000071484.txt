Q:

How do i publish in a callback function?

Good evening,
my problem is that i want to subscribe and publish in the same node. I need to publish in a callback function but the nodehandle is initialized in the main(). How can i publish a messages in  callback function? Is it possible to use a pointer to a publisher? If yes how could i do that?
Please help!

A:

This is easily possible and you should be able to find many examples of this in existing ROS packages. Some examples: node (inside class), nodelet.
