Q:

Openni for groovy version

Hi!
My question is: for groovy version of ROS on linux which openni packages will give full openni installation?
I have openni_launch. Should I also install openni_kinect, openni_camera, etc.?
It seems that different packages are needed for different versions and I don't want to ruin something, since I'm very unsure linux user.
I tried to understand this through tutorials, but seem to have problems here.
