Q:

Error "bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'" during tutorial

Starting my training back up I arrived successfully at:
Using rqt_console and roslaunch
All previous lessons were achieved.
ROS' roscore command was entered into a separate terminal earlier.  Tests up to this point all work as directed by ROS wiki.
Now, at this point:
By entering "echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH" this command outputs to one of my Ubuntu terminals:
/home/ju78iklo9/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share

While in ju78iklo9@ju78iklo9-Lenovo-H50-00:~/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/launch$
I entered:
roslaunch beginner_tutorials turtlemimic.launch

Ubuntu terminal outputs:
roslaunch beginner_tutorials turtlemimic.launch

I get this response:
...  logging to /home/ju78iklo9/.ros/log/a29cb34c-e6b4-lle7-aa15-acb57d898fed/roslaunch-ju78iklo9-Lenovo-H50-00-6404.log

Don checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: syntax error: Line 1, column 3
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Meanwhile...my "launch" file is/was copied directly from ROS tutorials. A vim "less" command reproduces:
   1 <launch>
   2 
   3   <group ns="turtlesim1">
   4     <node pkg="turtlesim" name="sim" type="turtlesim_node"/>
   5   </group>
   6 
   7   <group ns="turtlesim2">
   8     <node pkg="turtlesim" name="sim" type="turtlesim_node"/>
   9   </group>
  10 
  11   <node pkg="turtlesim" name="mimic" type="mimic">
  12     <remap from="input" to="turtlesim1/turtle1"/>
  13     <remap from="output" to="turtlesim2/turtle1"/>
  14   </node>
  15 
  16 </launch>

Opening the log file in vim produces an amazing laundry list of errors.  For example:
1 <launch>
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
2
2: command not found
3 <group ns="turtlesim1"
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'

My questions is, "what is the problem? Why can't I proceed with ROS tutorials at this point?
Thank you in advance.

A:

If what you cited is the actual file content of yours, you copied the line number index that ROS wiki kindly shows for you. By clicking "Toggle line numbers" you can make those numbers disappear.
