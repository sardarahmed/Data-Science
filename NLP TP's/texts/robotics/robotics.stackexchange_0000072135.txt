Q:

Manifest's license tag for proprietary ROS packages

The license tag of package manifests (package.xml) seems to be mandatory. What should I set it to for a proprietary package that won't be open-sourced? (Assuming I'm not including or linking against "infectious" open-source licenses of course.)
I've been writing the following and then adding copyright headers to the actual source code.
<license>Proprietary</license>

I use Proprietary for the license on my private packages as well.

A:

Same here. REP-140 gives examples of OSS licenses (here), anything else is up to you.
What you shouldn't do though, is paste your license text in the license tag. I've seen ppl do that, and it's not what the tag is for.

Related, now license text file can be specified in package.xml format=3 after this PR.
