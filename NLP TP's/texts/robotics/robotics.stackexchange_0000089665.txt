Q:

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named serial_node.py below /opt/ros/kinetic/share/rosserial_python

When I tried to execute this, I got following error:
glv@VaraPrasad:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun rosserial_
rosserial_arduino  rosserial_client   rosserial_msgs     rosserial_python
glv@VaraPrasad:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun rosserial_python 
message_info_service.py  serial_node.py           
glv@VaraPrasad:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM1
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named serial_node.py below /opt/ros/kinetic/share/rosserial_python

In this Tutorial I encountered this rosrun statement, why we need to run this     glv@VaraPrasad:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM1
what is the use of it. And how to overcome this error??
Thanks In Advance

Please don't post link-only answers/comments to sites outside of ros.org.
Include the main parts of the answer/solution in your answer/comment itself.

I think it is also not right to take the solution from others an do not honor them.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-14:
It goes without saying that if/when you create an answer based on an external site, or quote large parts of it, you always include a link to the source.
Including a link != posting only a link.
