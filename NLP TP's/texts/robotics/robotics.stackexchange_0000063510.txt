Q:

Rviz Crashes (OGRE)

When running rviz I get the following error messages:
[ WARN] [1414015276.298139367]: OGRE EXCEPTION(7:InternalErrorException): Could not load dynamic library /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/OGRE-1.8.0/RenderSystem_GL.

Aborted (core dumped)

I'm running on Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo.
My graphics card info:
VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0102] (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])

UPDATE 1
Running rviz tries to compile against OGRE 1.8.1, and then gives the error messages above
[ INFO] [1414078694.030851551]: compiled against OGRE version 1.8.1 (Byatis)

and on this path
 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

I have three versions of OGRE
OGRE-1.8.0/ OGRE-1.8.1/ OGRE-1.9.0/ 

UPDATE 2
So I removed all versions of OGRE.
First installed libogre-1.9-dev. For some reason, rviz was also removed from my machine. I tried to install it again, and it says:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-indigo-rviz : Depends: libogre-1.8-dev but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

So I Installed  libogre-1.8-dev and then installed rviz , but again getting the error messages above while running rviz and it crashes
UPDATE 3
Ok I uninstalled OGRE (and rviz automatically)
  sudo apt-get remove libogre-1.8.0 libogre-1.8.0-dbg libogre-1.8-dev 

I tried to install rviz and this time didn't give any dependency error and automatically installed ogre too
  sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rviz

Just in case I also ran this command:
  sudo apt-get install libogre-1.8.0 libogre-1.8.0-dbg libogre-1.8-dev 

Currently in  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ I have only these ogre folders:
OGRE-1.8.0/ OGRE-1.8.1/

Do you have a custom version of OGRE installed? From the library path, it looks like it's trying to use a custom version of OGRE rather than the system default.

Not actually, it's default installation of ubuntu 14.04
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2014-10-23:
Are you sure? /home/stefania/software/ogre/OgreMain/src/OgreDynLib.cpp seems to suggest otherwise.

This is interesting! /home/Stefania is not on my machine!

A:

Webots Software was the reason that rviz was crashing on my machine. After I uninstalled webots, rviz again is working fine.
