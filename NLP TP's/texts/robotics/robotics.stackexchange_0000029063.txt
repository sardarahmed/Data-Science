Q:

How to set the pose of a box importing data

Hi there! I am using gazebo-11 to test the navigation algorithm based on visual odometry implemented on NASA's Curiosity rover.
In particular, I created a stereo camera model and I made it move along a line and take photos at a certain rate. In order to simulate osbtacles I introduced manually (it took me a great amount of time!!!) in the .world file a number of boxes (about 200) which are different from each other in terms of dimensions, position and orientation.
Is there a way to import from a .txt file (or other formats) the information about pose and size of each box so that a box of such size and pose is actually introduced in the Gazebo world (the GUI)?
Probably I have to write a plugin or something similar. Than you so much in advance!!

A:

Yes, you can write a world plugin and spawn the models dynamically at runtime.
You can prepare your input data as a yaml file (probably the easiest) and read it in with yaml-cpp. Then you can construct model messages based on that input and publish them so that gazebo can then spawn the models.
See the GUIExampleSpawnWidget example (ignore the gui part).
