Q:

robotic arm safety with proximity sensor

Hello
I am working on a robotic arm.
The issue I'm working on right now is security.
My aim is to slow down the speed of the robotic arm if a human enters the environment while the robotic arm is moving.
The closer the human gets to the robotic arm, the more I want to slow down the robotic arm.
I used setMaxVelocityScalingFactor and setMaxAccelerationScalingFactor for this, but these can be used before execution.
The speed of the robotic arm should slow down during execution.
that is, I want to reduce the speed of the robotic arm when a human enters the environment while the robotic arm is moving.
Thank you so much

A:

I am not aware of any standard ros package that has the behavior you ask for. I think you need to write custom code to implement this. If you are using ros_control, I'd investigate adding this new behavior to the FollowJointTrajectory Action Server.

The scaled_joint_trajectory_controller in UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_scaled_controllers implements a version of the JointTrajectoryController which can dynamically update the 'rate' at which it executes trajectories. That could be something the OP could use.
Provided the "robotic arm" mentioned is ros_control compatible.
But: it's certainly not safety rated, so depending on the requirements would not be sufficient for a truly safe environment. Especially with humans close by.
