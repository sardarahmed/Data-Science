Q:

Uploading a trained ANN to an ESP32 board

I am working on a project that requires training a neural network with humidity and temperature values. After spending a while googling on how to run a neural network on ESP32 (Wemos LOLIN D32 Pro), I came to the conclusion that off-board training and then uploading would be the best option. But I didn't get any resource on doing that.
How can I upload a trained neural network model(TensorFlow, scikit-learn ...) to an ESP32 board?

A:

You can printout your weights and bias value from your model in TensorFlow, PyTorch or other deep learning library. If you want to convert your model to ESP32, you must create your own code to define your feed forward network. It's very simple, like create a matrix multiplication program and also create your own activation function. Then, you take weights and bias value from your trained model and define manually in your code as variable or constant. It is should works.
