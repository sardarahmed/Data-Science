Q:

how to move to a specific postion

Hello All
I am using Ros to command Gazebo. I have already incorporated the DiffDrive Plugin and used it to drive it around; and I have also write a rosnode to send out cmd_vel topic command.
The next step I am looking for is to:
1) get the current position of my robot. 

this probably has something to do with     tf, I will investigate in it.
2) move to a specific position without worrying about obstacle, 

What I need help is number 2. Do you guys know any off-the-shelves package or tutorial I could use ?  Where should I start this?
Your help is much appreciated.

A:

For step 1: write a tf publisher
For step 2: a motion planning library with some way to detect obstacles.
