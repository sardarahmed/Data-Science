Q:

Migration from Fuerte to Hydro

I am working on some code that I haven't made.
The thing is that I have to work in Hydro and this code was made for Fuerte.
I tried to catkinize the packages changing the manifest.xml and CMakeLists.txt
I don't know if it is needed to change anything else but when I try to make the package I get an error.

A:

You know that you don't have to catkinize your code to try it with Hydro? May it is better to first get the packages building using rosbuild (adapting them to potential API changes of dependencies) and after that consider to catkinize them.
