Q:

Why is not created the install_aarch64/share directory? - cross compile tool

Hi, I want to compile a ROS2 foxy demo in my pc running a VM with Linux Ubuntu 18.04 and then run it in my 64 bits arm processor running Linux Ubuntu 20.04 arm64, I am using this tool, I install the prerequisites, when I install docker I use this method and then I use this steps to run containers as a non-root user as mentioned in the prerequisites part:
Prerequisites
This tool requires that you have already installed
Docker
Follow the instructions to add yourself to the docker group as well, so you can run containers as a non-root user
Python 3.6 or higher
then I install the ross cross compile and follow this tutorial, everything goes ok but I realize 2 things:
1.- the expected outputs are not the same
I don´t have the tutorial.repos
2.- the install_aarch64/share path is not created, I realize this when I try to run the build in my target, in this step:
rosdep install --from-paths install_aarch64/share --ignore-src --rosdistro foxy -y
I got an error that says that the install_aarch64/share directory does not exists and wen I enter In the install_aarch64 directory I can confirm that
what could be the problem?

Could you link to where it is fixed? A pull request perhaps?

That's a link to the repository. If the bug was fixed in that repository, could you link to where it was fixed?

I don´t know, I am not the repo owner or mantainer, you could search in the issues tab in the repo

so how did you notice it is now fixed?
You just updated it and it happened to work when you tried again?

I was trying to use it and I could not do it so I open an issue, read the issues
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2021-11-11:
Why not just link us to those issues? I'm not sure I understand what the problem was to do that in your initial answer.

You could check the issues in the repo, I shared the link before

There seems to be only a single issue opened by you: ros-tooling/cross_compile#342.
