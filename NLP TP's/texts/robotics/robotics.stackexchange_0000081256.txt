Q:

error: 'Point' does not name a type

Hi,
I'm trying to utilize the geometry_msgs 'Point' type and receiving this error:
/home/viki/catkin_ws/src/ibvs/src/visual_servoing.cpp:42:1: error: ‘Point’ does not name a type
Point CENTER = Point(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2);
^
I'm assuming its something to do with my Cmakelists.txt or package.xml, as I've specified the include.

I've also tried an alternate syntax, which still returns a similar error (see image link below).

A:

Looks like there are a few problems here:

The Point class is in the geometry_msgs namespace, so you should use the fully-namespaced class type: geometry_msgs::Point
ROS message types (such as point) only have default constructors, so you have to construct the object before you can fill in its fields.
You cannot have code outside of a function or class in C++ (as in your second try)

P.S. - for future questions please use the "preformatted text" button and paste your code and error messages directly into the question.
