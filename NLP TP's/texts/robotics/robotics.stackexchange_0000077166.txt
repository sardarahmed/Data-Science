A:

There is an example available within hector_quadrotor: https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor/blob/indigo-devel/hector_quadrotor_description/urdf/quadrotor_hokuyo_utm30lx.urdf.xacro
This model is using xacro scriptping to re-use different URDF model parts and adds the Gazebo plugin so the LIDAR is also available in simulation. Specifically, it uses a macro from the hokuyo_utm30lx.urdf.xacro file to add a Hokuyo LIDAR. This is different from the Turtlebot tutorial you linked, which only deals with updating the model without consideration of simulation.

I am basically planning to add 4 such Hokuyo LIDAR(or even sonar sensors. Could you suggest me how to do that?
