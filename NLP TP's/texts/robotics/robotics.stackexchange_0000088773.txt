The question is dewarp them to what? Both of the fisheye images have a FOV just over 180 degrees. Rectifying such images will necessarily crop off some of the images. What are you planning on using the dewarped images for? Would a skybox be more suitable?

I want to detect qr codes.So for that the image view should be straight i.e undistorted so for that I thought of dewraping the image and then use the footage for qr detection. So is there any way to do that qr detection. Is there any package to Detect qr or dewraping and republish the footage.

A:

I believe #q277153 has some useful information.
