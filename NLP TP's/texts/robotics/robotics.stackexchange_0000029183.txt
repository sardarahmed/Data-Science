Q:

Windows Installation Error: The C compiler is not able to compile a simple test program windows

Hello,
I'm trying to install Gazebo on my Windows 10 machine and I'm following the official tutorial (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_on_windows&cat=install). When I try to configure and build the dependencies I get the following error:

It's clear that it's caused by CMake, but I couldn't find out the problem
Any idea on how to fix it?
Many thanks in advance.

A:

Not sure if the real problems is the use of x86_x64instead of x86_amd64, is the only thing that catch my attention from that log.
As an alternative, I would recommend exploring the new options of installing Gazebo driven by different community members and detailed here https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/issues/2901. Particularly the conda-forge installation is most active one.

I followed the conda-forge installation and I executed the two commands successfully, but there are no instructions on how to run Gazebo after installation, simply typing "gazebo" on the cmd terminal does not run it
Comment by Jose Luis Rivero on 2021-04-21:
You probably need to call it from the "Anaconda prompt" see https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/
Comment by Abdo_Ameen on 2021-04-21:
it does not run using Anaconda prompt neither ("gazebo" is not recognized as internal or external command, operable program or batch file.)

Was the problem fixed in https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/issues/2976#event-4625876038?
Comment by Abdo_Ameen on 2021-04-22:
yes, in another way, simply by installing ROS, and I got Gazebo included by default.
Thank you for your help Mr. Rivero
