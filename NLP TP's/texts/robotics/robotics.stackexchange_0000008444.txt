Q:

Is there a way to turn the sound off of a Roomba?

I am working with an iRobot Create 2 and I work with others around me. Whenever I turn the robot on, send it an OI reset command, etc., it makes its various beeps and noises. I would like to not have this happen since I find it a little annoying and I'm sure those who have to work around me would like to have things quiet so they can concentrate on their work. Is there a way to accomplish turning off the beeps (while still being able to easily re-enable them), or am I out of luck?

A:

No, there is no software or hardware volume control on the Roomba.  
You could probably put a potentiometer inline with the speaker wire to manually change the volume.  However, getting to the speaker is a bit of work.  But I believe is totally doable.  You just have to disassemble (and reassemble) lots of the robot.  This would make a great project, be sure to submit it!
P.S. I just found this page (http://www.schneordesign.com/Avi/irobot/roomba_spk1.htm) on how to access the Roomba speaker.  The page is actually about how to fix a broken speaker, but there are step-by-step instructions on how to get to the speaker.  And once you are are there, you can cut a wire for no sound, or add in some resistance for a quieter sound.
