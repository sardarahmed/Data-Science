Q:

Any support for Motoman HC10?

Currently performing a benchmark for collaborative robots using ROS. I have been searching but I cannot find support for this robot. Anybody can confirm this?
Thanks.

A:

The Motoman HC10 and HC20 are now available in the Motoman repo with the motoman_drive v1.9.0.
However some of the collaborative robot feather have limitations under ROS.  You should carefully review the associated note: HC Robot Notes for ROS

I've made this the accepted answer, as, as of 1.9.0, HC robots are indeed supported by MotoROS.
