Q:

Can planning success be checked in the Python MoveGroupCommander?

The C++ MoveGroup's plan function returns an error code, but the Python MoveGroupCommander's plan function seems to return only the RobotTrajectory. Am I misunderstanding it? What is the best way to check in Python if a motion plan was successful?

A:

By checking if the trajectory contains points, in kinetic/melodic at least:
plan = move_group.plan()
if plan.joint_trajectory.points:  # True if trajectory contains points
  move_success = move_group.execute(plan)
else:
  rospy.logerr("Trajectory is empty. Planning was unsuccessful.")

Looks like this API might change, and success might be returned via a tuple in the future.
