Q:

Problem installing any package

Hello! I am a newbie to ROS. Please bear with me.
Edit 1: I am unable to install any package now. I tried installing Turtlebot Simulator and I am getting the same error. I think there is some problem with ROS itself.
I am unable to install jackal simulator from clearpathrobotics. I get the following error -
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-jackal-simulator
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-jackal-desktop
I am not sure why this is happening as I have ROS Indigo installed and running Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.
I tried the installation after sudo-apt-get-update, and still I get the same error.
Can anyone please tell why I am unable to install?
Thank you.

Did you install ROS through apt-get? Are you using ARM or x86?

Thru apt-get

Have you modified your /etc/apt/sources.list or any of the files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ since you installed ROS?

No. I have not modified the sources.list file. And there are no files in sources.list.d

A:

Using apt-get to install ROS packages assumes that you've installed ROS through apt.
Step 1.2 in the Jade for Ubuntu installation instructions should create a file called ros-latest.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d. This is the sources file which tells apt where to find and download the ROS packages.
If that file doesn't exist, you need to repeat steps 1.2 and 1.3, and then run sudo apt-get update

Thank you very much! This fixed my problem. I am not sure why this happened. I was able to install the beginner tutorials without any problem though. Anyway, thanks again.
