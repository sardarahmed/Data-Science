Q:

Palleting using ROS-I ur_modern_driver

( This may seem to be an uninformed question )
UR Script and the teach pendant have built-in functions for palleting operations. Does similar built-in functions exist in ur_modern_driver?
Using:

UR10
UR Sim 3.4.5-100
ROS Indigo
Ubuntu 14.04

No.
The driver you mention is meant to allow fine-grained / real-time motion control from ROS, it's not a remote application programming interface. It is not meant to expose every urscript statement so it can be used remotely.
Palletising is an application level coordination activity, so is not part of the driver.

Alright, how would I go about building a palletising application in ROS if I want to use the ur_modern_driver to communicate with the UR10?
