Q:

How do I update ROS?

I just received my Kinect.  I am in the process of installing ubuntu 11.04.  I had a prior version of ROS installed... Is there a simple way to upgrade the current installation?
Sorry, this is a very newbie question.  I've spent a little time searching for the answer but it hasn't jumped out at me.

Hi,
If you got ROS from package manager, try
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Simple: use Synaptic or aptitude or whatever to remove the ros-cturtle-* packages and install the ros-diamondback-* packages you need.

My last opinion maybe incorrect. I have tried on cturtle with dist-upgrade,it doesn't upgrade to diamondback, but only upgrade all the cturtle packages. So how to upgrade cturtle to diamondback?Thank you~

I figured out that dist-upgrade is not only for ROS. Why dist-upgrade can upgrade the ROS version not just upgrade all the packages of ROS?
Comment by Martin Günther on 2011-07-20:
No, 'dist-upgrade' will not upgrade ubuntu. You can also just do a normal 'apt-get upgrade' instead. (The difference between 'upgrade' and 'dist-upgrade' is that 'dist-upgrade' does some stuff to handle changed dependencies etc. correctly.)

Is 'apt-get dist-upgrade' only for upgrade ROS version or it will also upgrade ubuntu?  And how to only update ROS packages?

Also make sure they read packages.ros.org not code.ros.org.  The code.ros.org debian repo is deprecated.  http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu#diamondback.2BAC8-Installation.2BAC8-Sources.Setup_your_sources.list
Comment by Martin Günther on 2011-06-28:
Exactly. Before doing that however, you should have a look at the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list and uncomment the lines starting with "deb" (remove the #). They are commented out automatically during upgrade. (I am assuming you are upgrading from Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04?)
