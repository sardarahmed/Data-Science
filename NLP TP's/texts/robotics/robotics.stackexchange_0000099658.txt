Q:

Is there a way to subscribe to different topics at the same time in rospy?

I am subscribing to various topics and I wish to print them into a .csv log file, but I am not able to print any one of them outside their own callback function.
You can see the code at Click for Code and it will be great if you could let me know what I am doing wrong?
Thank you.

Isn't this something you'd want to do with rosbag? Especially because you want to convert the data to .csv?

Yes, I am trying to do that. But I was not successful in doing the conversion to csv, will you please tell me a working rosabg_to_csv convertor?

A:

You could just create the subscriber inside a class and use a member variable to save them in the correct order or use the time as a key and then create a table when you desire.
Or if the data is synchronized you could try to take a look at http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters.
In any case, take a look at the message filters package.
