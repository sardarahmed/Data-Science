Q:

how to disable batch-saving pointclouds

Hi,
Does anyone know how to disable batch-saving of point clouds? I found some relevant code on line 100 of node.cpp but don't really know what to do to disable it. I'm trying to slim down memory requirements so all I would require is the pose estimates.
Cheers,
Ken

A:

Have a look at the new snapshot and set its parameter "store_pointcloud" and "use_glwidget" to false.
