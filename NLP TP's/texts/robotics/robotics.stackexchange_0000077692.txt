Q:

nav2d toturial 3

Hello everybody,
i'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ROS Indigo
i'm trying to launch tutorial 3 for nav2d package. but it seems that there's error in the mapper.
all what i did is
first i launched the toturial3
roslaunch nav2d_tutorials tutorial3.launch

then  in a separate terminal i call these services as instructed since i don't have a joystick.
rosservice call /StartMapping 3
rosservice call /StartExploration 2

here is the screen shots of the errors.

Thank you in advance.

Looks like the mapper dies right on startup. Can you please send the log file that is mentioned in the error message? And please check your installed boost-version. It should be 1.54.0.1 from Ubuntu 14.04. Have you ever installed another boost version then the one from Ubuntu repositories?

PS: Do you have installed nav2d as binary package or is it a source build?

Regularly update all your ROS packages to avoid conflicts between packages that have different release versions.
