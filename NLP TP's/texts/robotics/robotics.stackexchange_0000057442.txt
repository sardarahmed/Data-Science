Q:

Is there a standard message type for waypoint in 3D space?

Going to add a control in the flight plan mavros.
Is there a standard message / ROS API for managing waypoint?

A:

Does nav_msgs/Path have what you want?

In APM we have several types of waypoints with additional parameters and in global or local frame (coordinates).
And it dosen't use orientation (only coordinates).

You could just ignore the orientation of the path? If you have special custom parameters you probably wont find them in a standard message? @dan-lazewatsky: that should be "Path", not "Plan" ;)

Thanks, I decided to use custom message type for waypoints.
And extra node for translation to geographic_msgs/WayPoint (if it really needed).
