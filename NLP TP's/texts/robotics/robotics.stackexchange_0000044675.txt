Q:

Install ROS on Arch Linux on Raspberry Pi

Has anyone successfully installed ROS Arch Linux on Raspberry Pi? I saw @MarkyMark2012 got ROS going on Debian and RPi here.
I tried following the Arch Linux instructions but they don't work. There appears to be no tool called "packer" either installed by default or found using pacman (their package installer). Also the work around for python didn't work at all for me ... I just got lots of errors.
Before I waste a lot of time figuring out my issues with python ... just wondering if anyone has already solved this and documented it somewhere? Or is there an SD Card image available I could just download?
Thanks.

A:

I gave up on ROS on Arch Linux because of the Python 3 issues. I ran into too many issues getting ROS to work with what it likes (python 2) and what Arch likes (python 3).
