Q:

turning turtlebot a set number of degrees

I'm looking for a way to turn my robot a certain angle in a cpp node. I have read through these questions:
http://answers.ros.org/question/12557/how-to-make-the-turtlebot-rotate-in-place-a-set-of/
The above made sense, so then I looked for a way to acquire the heading of the robot,
http://answers.ros.org/question/30926/getting-turtlebot-heading/
The user in the above question can already get their robot's quaternion data and I cannot making the answer not very helpful. Could someone explain an efficient way to acquire the robot's quaternion data and explain how the answer in the 2nd link works?
Thanks!

I think this could help.

A:

I don't have a turtlebot, but some node should be publishing nav_msgs/Odometry, probably as an /odom or /odom_combined topic.
The orientation field in that message contains a quaternion indicating your robot's 3-dimensional orientation. Converting that to a yaw angle should give your 2-dimensional heading, if that is what you want.

Don't feel bad. There is a lot going on in a full-sized ROS system.

I am even dumber, can figure out given these hints. Would be great to have some codes from you guys.
