A:

The problem you are seeing occurrs when the tf node is not generating the link transforms.  This occurs because this node is probably not started yet.  One reason can be that the warehouse planning configuration has not been accepted (the Rviz window sometimes hides the configuration dialogue when it starts up.

Select the planning scene warehouse viewer window (see below)

Accept the default configuration

The rest of the application should load correctly.

If this doesn't solve your problem, then you might not have the correct ROS libraries installed.  Please include the roslaunch output if this procedure doesn't work for you.

Yes,thank you~ I solve it! I found that I should click accept and "close warehouse_viewer again" to let warehouse_viewer show normal interface and RViz will become normal robot model.
