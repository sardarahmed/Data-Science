Q:

Waiting on transform from /base_footprint to /map to become available before running costmap, tf error:

I want to auto navigate my P3AT.
Using ROS-Fuertr (on PC1: UBUNTU 12.04 LTS) & USARSim (on PC2: windows7 ).
I have my launch file move_base.launch,
<launch>

  <master auto="start"/>
  <!-- Run the map server -->
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/map/map.pgm 0.05"/>

  <!--- You can see original move_base.launch -->
  <!--- Run AMCL -->
  <include file="$(find usarsim_inf)/launch/usarsim.launch"/>
  <include file="$(find amcl)/examples/amcl_omni.launch" />
  
  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/launch/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="global_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/launch/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="local_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/launch/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/launch/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/launch/move_base_params.yaml" command="load" />
    </node>
  
</launch>

but when i try,
$ roslaunch my_robot_name_2dnav move_base.launch

i am getting an warning message,
[ WARN] [1413488778.937642524]: Waiting on transform from /base_footprint to /map to become available before running costmap, tf error: 

see here the full terminal output
please help to improve this scenario.

how do you solved it?
Comment by Aarif on 2015-05-02:
hi @pexison, my simulator was publishing laser scan on lms200 topic instead of /scan , i remapped the the publishing from lms200 to /scan and that worked form me...
if your laser data is being published on /scan topic then you might look on  time on both the PCs, the should be synchronize

Hi @Aarif, Please tell how did you change the topic from lms200 to /scan?
