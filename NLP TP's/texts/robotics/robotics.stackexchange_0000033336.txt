Q:

Duplicate images using GSCAM

Hi,
I am trying to use GSCAM to capture video from a composite video input through a ViewCast Osprey 230 analogue video capture card.
I have set GSCAM_CONFIG to:
GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace"

And viewing the video through image_view
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/gscam/image_view

The problem is the image is duplicated. I only get this problem running when using gscam and the capture card, a USB webcam I have tested works fine. I presume that I need to alter GSCAM_CONFIG but I have not been able to find the correct configuration yet.
Screenshot of my problem: Duplicate images http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/%7Ecclw05/v4l2-20110727.png
Any help would be much appreciated!
Thanks

when i give rosrun image_view image_view image:=/gscam/image_view, i'm getting only empty window without video. how to proceed further?

A:

After some more searching, I believe I need to perform some kind of interlacing to alternate between the images from the top field and bottom field. Haven't figured out how to do that yet..
Meanwhile, I have resorted to cropping and resizing. I'm sure this is wrong, but I'm doing this until I figure out how to interlace the video.
GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! videocrop top=0 left=0 right=0 bottom=288 ! videoscale ! video/x-raw-yuv,width=720,height=576 ! ffmpegcolorspace"
