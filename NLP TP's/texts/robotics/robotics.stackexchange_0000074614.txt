Q:

libpcan.h not found

I have working code on an Ubuntu 14.04 VM that uses libpcan as a dependency. Everything runs great.
Now I am trying to build the same project on a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 partition. Suddenly libpcan is not recognized as a package.
I have tried to reinstall libpcan using rosdep
$ roscd libpcan
$ rosdep install libpcan
$ rosmake libpcan

However I cannot find the install_libpcan.sh setup file to run after installing. I've since checked the directory found with
$ roscd libpcan

on both my VM and my partition, and they have the exact same contents: a cmake directory, and a package.xml.
Has anyone come across this issue?

A:

This can be solved by downloading and installing the PeakCAN Linux drivers.
