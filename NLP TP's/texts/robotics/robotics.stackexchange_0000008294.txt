Q:

Need a mobile robot simulator that provides easier odometry funtions

I want a mobile robot to go from a starting position to a goal position. But, I don't want to calculate the pose from encoders. Instead I want to know if there exist such a simulator that provides pose function that makes the work easier, like go_to(x_coordinate, y_coordinate). That means, the robot will automatically calculate its current position and leads itself to the goal position. 

A:

This closed StackOverflow question has a long list of simulators and some discussion on them.  Some are simple and 2D only, some are 3D and include rigid body physics simulation.
