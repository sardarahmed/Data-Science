Q:

How to start contributing?

I'm currently a college junior student in computer engineering and really interested in robotics / hardware control via software and want to get into ROS. I have some experience with using Arduino, knowledge of some hardware design in logic level, and wrote some codes for a avionics control unit, yet I found jumping into ROS to be, a bit, overwhelming.
Can someone provide some starter help? Like, where to start with, how to start with, and when to consider contributing? I have configured environment and is going through tutorial.
Thanks a lot!

A:

There are some pointers for getting involved here: http://www.ros.org/contribute/ and some more detailed pointers here: http://wiki.ros.org/Get%20Involved
If you can find some ROS packages that you use, I'd suggest looking at open tickets for it, or consider identifying a new feature you'd like to see and submitting a pull request to make the change. If you start with small things you can get feedback during the review process and work your way up to larger changes.
