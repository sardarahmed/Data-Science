Hey! I'd like to update this question, as I'm also interested if working with Openni 2.0 and ROS will be soon possible?

A:

Under hydro, you can use the following:

openni2_camera and openni2_launch drivers support Primesense/Asus devices.
freenect_stack drivers support Kinect

Both packages end up using rgbd_launch for shared functionality (such as loading image_proc and depth_proc nodelets), so it is somewhat easier to switch between the two drivers as they support similar parameters and topic names.
