Q:

brown's irobot_create_2_1 driver unable to run

$ rosrun irobot_create_2_1 driver.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/brown_drivers/irobot_create_2_1/bin/driver.py", line 15, in 
from irobot_create_2_1.msg import SensorPacket
ImportError: No module named irobot_create_2_1.msg
Running Ubuntu 11.10 (fresh install).
Installed ROS using: sudo apt-get install ros-electric-desktop
Installed irobot_create_2_1 using: sudo apt-get install ros-electric-brown-drivers
I thought that was all I needed to do to get it working... or is there something extra?
Thanks.

If you're looking for a driver for the irobot create.  I suggest that you look at the turtlebot_driver package and turtlebot_node.  The turtlebot is based on the iRobot Create.  http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_driver  and http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_node

A:

Michael Ferguson (fergs) is right. I accidentally pulled both the Makefile and rosdep.yaml from the irobot_create_2_1 repo when doing some other maintenance work. This has been corrected both in the repo and in our package releases (though these of course take time to catch up). You can pull a fresh checkout via:
svn co https://brown-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/irobot_create_2_1 irobot_create_2_1

or you can download the individually missing files: Makefile and rosdep.yaml .
My sincere apologies. This was really bone-headed and I will spend the requisite time on the wheel.
