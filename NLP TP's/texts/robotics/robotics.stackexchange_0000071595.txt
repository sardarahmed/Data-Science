Q:

NAO with nao_path_follower?

Hi all,
New to ROS world.
How to launch the package nao_path_follower (nao_path_follower) ?
I've check the package github:
the package github , no launch file and config file.
Do I have to write the my launch file and config file to make this node been shown in the rosnode list?
Thanks!
