Q:

Beginner here: Need step-by-step help with amcl navigation through a pre-existing .pgm map

Hello. I am trying to navigate through a pre-existing map .pgm file using amcl. I am completely new to ROS and do not understand some of the coding jargon on the websites of ros.org. If someone would be kind enough to provide step by step instructions online, that would be great. Please help. Thank You.
