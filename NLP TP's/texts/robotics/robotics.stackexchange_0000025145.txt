Q:

ROS2 - Rviz2 connect to ros instance?

is it possible to rviz to the robot through network ?
I used to do this from a ubuntu VM to a rpi but I had to install a master and a slave
now I am really talking about installing Qt graphical tools and connect to the robot via network
how can I do that ? the only example I found is via ssh
thanks

A:

Yes! What you're describing is another example of a multi-machine setup, which is described in the official documentation here.
To provide more detail, you need to make sure that

Your robot and your laptop can communicate with each other over the network. The easiest way to confirm this is with the ping command.
Both the robot and the laptop have the ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment variable set to the same value.

To do this you'll need to be able to run commands on your robot, because that environment variable needs to be set on the robot in the same environment that you launch your ROS 2 configurations with. The ssh command is the most popular way to do that, but if you interact with your robot using a keyboard+monitor you could do it that way instead.
