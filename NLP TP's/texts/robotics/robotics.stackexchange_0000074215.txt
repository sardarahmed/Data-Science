A:

your question is about hectorslam,not gmapping.
rplidar has a default launch file with hectorslam that can run without any configuration,  it locate at here
download it  it your catkin_ws/src , and put hectorslam sourcefiles  there too.
catkin_make
roslaunch rplidar view_slam.launch

that would probably works.

Thanks for your help.
Now, it works well.
But, when the time is longer than somtimes, It will error.
I want to know that how can I scan more time
or the limit of the time or area.
