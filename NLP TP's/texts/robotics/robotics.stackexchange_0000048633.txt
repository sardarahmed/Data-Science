Q:

OpenNI devices and USB 3.0

None of our OpenNI devices (Kinect, Xtion, PrimeSense Carmine) work when attached to USB 3.0 ports on our computers running ROS Fuerte and Ubuntu 12.04. These computers all have either NEC/Renesas uPD720200 controllers or Intel Panther Point (integrated in the chipset) controllers.
Has anyone successfully used these sensors on USB 3.0 ports?

As far as I am aware, that is an OpenNI and/or Ubuntu issue, not a ROS issue. I haven't seen anyone get USB 3.0 to work with any of these sensors.

I believe there are recent Linux kernel updates in Precise to fix some USB 3.0 problems. Not sure exactly what problems.

A:

On Ubuntu 12.10, USB 3.0 issues have been solved in majority.I know it doesn't concern your case, but maybe you could think about updating to 12.10 and Groovy (for which all my USB 3.0 works).
Bests regards,
Steph
