Q:

Moving UR_Gazebo through test_move.py

I am not able to move the UR simulation with ur_gazebo using action client server like test_move.py. MoveIt with gazebo however works fine.
Note: Using ur_gazebo on Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo and gazebo 2.x.

I'm confused: you're asking about ur_gazebo, but then state that you're using ur_modern_driver. The driver is not used with Gazebo. Please clarify and carefully describe your setup.

So is there a way of sending joint commands to ur_gazebo directly using a python script? I don't want to use MoveIt to control the robot in ur_gazebo @gvdhoorn

A:

The setup in ur_gazebo uses gazebo_ros_control to load a joint_trajectory_controller. This exposes a standard FollowJointTrajectory action server, just like any of the available drivers.
test_move.py can make use of that, provided it can find the action topics.

Perfect, all I had to do was append "arm_controller/" to the subscriber.
