Q:

saving depth image into pcd

Hi,
I would like to save the depth images into pcd format files which I viewed in rviz through openni_kinect. Can someone gives some clues?
Thanks
Best,
Kang

Hey Kang,
There is a PCL tutorial on writing point cloud data to PCD files available here. Additionally, there is a simple tool called pointcloud_to_pcd which does this and is located in the pcl_ros folder. You would run something along the lines of:
rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd input:=/camera/depth/points2

if your depth data was being published on /camera/depth/points2. The node would then write a PCD file for each message it received.
Hope this helps,
Peter

Thanks Peter, I did not notice that we should mention the input. Now, it works.
