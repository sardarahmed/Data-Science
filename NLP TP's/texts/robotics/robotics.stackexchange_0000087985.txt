Q:

Generate srvs from directory using catkin build

For srv generation, I've taken to using add_service_files(DIRECTORY srv) instead of listing each file individually, since it's more compact and I don't ever put srvs in that directory that I don't want generated.
However, one downside is, since you don't have to edit the CMakeLists.txt file when you add a new srv to that directory, it doesn't generate them unless I do a catkin clean or I make some edit to CMakeLists.txt.
What I want to know, is there a way to force it to generate the srvs with a catkin build without having to do a clean, and without making bogus edits to CMakeLists.txt?

A:

With catkin build you can trigger an explicit CMake configure invocation by passing --force-cmake (see catkin build --help).
