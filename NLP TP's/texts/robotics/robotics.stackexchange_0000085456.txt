A:

Command must have printed some kind of output. Generally speaking when asking questions please provide system output as much as possible.
Make sure the bag file contains the right topics with non-zero count. In your case, inspect using rosbag's commandline tools by the following, the PCL topic you want to convert is contained (the following example is using a different message as you haven't provided enough info so that I have no idea what message it should be):
rosbag info run1_2013-05-28-10-41-40_0.bag
:
topics:      /velodyne_packets   119 msgs @ 100.0 Hz : geometry_msgs/Point

sorry that i didn't added any system output. I have used the command rosbag info run1_2013-05-28-10-41-40_0.bag already and the package which i want to convert to pcd is available. pointcloud folder is creating but couldn't find the pcd file in the folder.

Please update your original question post to add the command line output. You still haven't provided enough info so that it's difficult to help you in general.
