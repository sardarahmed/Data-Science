Q:

Undocumented planning_environment parameters

The PR2's environment server launch file sets some parameters that are undocumented in the planning_environment package wiki page, in particular:

object_padd
pointcloud_padd
joint_state_cache_allowed_difference

Of these, the first two appear in the API docs of the package. My intention is to edit the wiki and document them. My question is mostly concerned with the third (undocumented?) parameter. Does it refer to the maximum allowed (past/future) extrapolation time when querying the joint states cache?.

Yes, it does refer to the maximum allowed past/future time. It won't really extrapolate, it will just use the joint states at the cache limits if the timestamps are outside the cache timestamp limits.

A:

Added undocumented parameters to the wiki and submitted a trivial doc patch.
