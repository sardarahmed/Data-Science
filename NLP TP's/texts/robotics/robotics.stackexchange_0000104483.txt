Q:

Compile error in Moveit "Getting started" documentation

First, let me make an observation unrelated to my question:
After going through most of the getting started documentation (https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started.html), I think it'd be better to base the documentation off of pre-compiled packages, and then move to building your own binaries if it becomes necessary.  I'm pretty sure I already had most of the packages I needed installed before I started the MoveIt documentation, so the build errors I've been running into are probably unnecessary.  And most have probably been caused by using a WSL2 Ubuntu install on windows, which has a few minor differences (such as a shared PATH environment variable).
That said, I'm running through the MoveIt getting started documentation (in a Windows WSL2 instance) and can't get past the compile step:
colcon build --mixin release
There's the following error:
...

A:

This looks more like a g++ issue than a MoveIt issue. I base my statement on the error message, which says

c++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus

You can maybe try updating your compiler to the latest version: sudo apt install build-essential and then try to build again.
Also, can you try out a simple build? That would involve not using the --mixin release part of it. AFAIK, the default build type should be release, in order to be optimised for runtime. This would eliminate any extra sources of problems.
It might also be a memory issue, as pointed out in this particular thread. You can try running dmesg right after the build fails to see if it complains about being out of memory or something similar.
