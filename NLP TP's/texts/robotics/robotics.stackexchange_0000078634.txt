Q:

Unable to locate driver for the xv-11 Lidar on kinetic?

According to the tutorial here all I need to type in to install the driver on Kinetic is:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-xv-11-laser-driver

When I enter this to the command line it tells me:
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-xv-11-laser-driver

A:

For the average case, the tutorial is correct: using apt-get (or whatever the package manager is on the particular Linux distribution that you are using) is the preferred way to install (ROS) packages.
In this particular case however, it would appear that the xv_11_laser_driver package has not been released into Kinetic yet, so you cannot install the binaries and will have to build the package from source. See #q252478 for some help on how to do that correctly (the question title mentions Ubuntu Mate, but the instructions should work on all Linux distributions that ROS supports).
PS: you can deduce that the package hasn't been released for Kinetic yet by looking at its wiki page: wiki/xv_11_laser_driver. Note how the version rocker at the top of the page only has buttons for hydro and indigo, but not for Kinetic. Another way to find out what has been released for a particular release of ROS are the status pages. status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=xv_11 shows the status of xv_11_laser_driver in Kinetic. Note that no package is listed (while the same page for Indigo does show the package).
