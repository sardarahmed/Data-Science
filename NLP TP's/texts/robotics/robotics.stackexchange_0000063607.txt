Q:

Building indigo on 14.10

Is it possible to build indigo on Utopic.
I have to run Utopic due to several issues that were solved in 14.10.
I tried the build from source, but I get
gazebo_ros: No definition of [gazebo] for OS version [utopic]
gazebo_plugins: No definition of [gazebo] for OS version [utopic]

A:

There are two files you need to create to set up local rosdep rules on your machine:
/etc/ros/rosdep/local.yaml, with the contents (note that the formatting and indentation in this file are important):
gazebo_ros:
    ubuntu: []
gazebo_plugins:
    ubuntu: []

And /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/10-local.list with the contents:
yaml file:///etc/ros/rosdep/local.yaml

ahendrix- I too try to build from source on utopic and ran into the above error message on gazebo, e.g. "ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies: gazebo_ros: no def... gazebo_plugins..."  I tried your suggestion still the same error mesg

After you make these changes, you need to run rosdep update.

OK, I tried "rosdep update", even after wiping and starting over with source build, but still unable to move pass the gazebo error..  I copied the pasted above into respective files you indicated, with root:root permission and readable by all.. I'm using utopic w/ ROS utopic (not trusty) repository?

I am also getting the OPs error. I just installed gazebo from source because I couldn't find any pre-built packages on Ubuntu Utopic.
I created the local.yaml and the 10-local.list files as you described and the error is still not resolved.
How to fix this?

Using that trick dependency checking passed. Unfortunately gazebo is still missing for compilation hence it fails. I couldn't find a clean way to install gazebo using ubuntu tools (apt dependencies broken) so it was necessary to take it directly from http://gazebosim.org/ . Version 5 seems to work.
