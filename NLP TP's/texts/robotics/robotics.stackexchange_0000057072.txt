Q:

Conference Speakers

If a speaker for ROS were invited to a conference in US or Europe, would someone be able to give a presentation ?
Would the speaker be able to get themselves somewhere or would travel need to be provided ?

A:

To me it seems that this depends highly on the combination of: Who is the speaker + What conference + What funding is available. I personally have been on a conference as an invited speaker within our research area (i.e. not ROS itself) on our own funds, so it is not impossible in general.
