Q:

Take certain parts of multipe rosbags and merge these to one rosbag

Is it possible to take  different parts from a rosbag (multiple rosbags) and put them all together at the end to one final rosbag?
So for example:
take from 1.bag: 30s - 55s
take from 2.bag: 75s - 90s
take from 3.bag: 40s - 60s
merge these 3 parts to final.bag
all of these bags have the same topic

A:

I believe you will have to write your own tool. It should be quite easy with the rosbag python api. I have small scripts for time filtering and merging and of bag files and they are all quite straight forward.
Edit: Here are the scripts. The time filtering is actually just a hacky invocation of a rosbag filter, but the merge script is gerneral purpose and you can even select only wanted topics with wildcards.

hey Demmeln could you explain how to properly use rosbag_filter_subsequence.sh? This tool seems to be exactly what I need, but I can't seem to get time filtering to work and ended up with a 2.7 gb bag file spanning multiple days

It is not a general purpose tool, but just an example of how you might want to use "rosbag filter". You will have to adapt it to your use case.
