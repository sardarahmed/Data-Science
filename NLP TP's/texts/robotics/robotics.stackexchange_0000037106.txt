Q:

Turtlebot / Kinect - not publishing any images?

I've built a mostly-turtlebot. After running the turtlebotbringup minimal and kinect.launch, it seems to run fine. The topics are all created, but no image data or depth data is ever published.
The turtlebot dashboard doesn't show anything amiss.
The front of the kinect is flashing it's green light.
Any clue where to look?
I tried an alternate power supply, wall power, and an alternate kinect. So it's probably not those issues.

Well, here's my answer for posterity:
It was a bug in my USB drivers in the kernel.
Running the freenect demos gave a lot of:
"Failed to submit isochronous transfer x: -1"
And dmesg informed me that usb_submit_urb was returning -28 (ENOSPC).
Switching up my kernel versions and USB drivers made everything come to life.
Thanks for the help everyone that tried, I really appreciate it.
