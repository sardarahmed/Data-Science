Q:

Stereovslam error :: Assertion `left_.tfFrame() == right_.tfFrame()'

After i publish my two left and right videos from stereo camera and run stereo_synchronizer node and stereo_image_proc node everything seems to go file but i get this error from stereo_vslam_node and see no output:
stereo_vslam_node: /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/vision_opencv/image_geometry/src/stereo_camera_model.cpp:28: bool image_geometry::StereoCameraModel::fromCameraInfo(const sensor_msgs::CameraInfo&, const sensor_msgs::CameraInfo&): Assertion `left_.tfFrame() == right_.tfFrame()' failed.

You can zoom in the file by opening it in another window.
Here is how my system looks , does anybody has anyidea what might be going wrong ??

A:

the frame on each camera should be the same. You're likely using separate frames for each, which might make intuitive sense, but the transforms re camerainfo are all meant to be referencing the same frame, and so stereo_image_proc needs them to be the same.
