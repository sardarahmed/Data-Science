Q:

Using the Axis 214 PTZ camera in ROS

Hi guys, I want to use the Axis 214 PTZ camera with ROS and have found this Driver:
axis
After downloading this package I've seen that this package only consists of two files:
axis.ph;
manifest.xml
So I have create my own package with the dependencies written in the manifest and  included the axis.ph file. After building the package I started the node but nothing happened (node is not running, no erros). Is that the right method? I'm a total newbie in ROS and Ubuntu. Therefore it would be nice if someone could give me a brief instruction. Thanks!

A:

Try ours. It was based on the one you found, but the one you found is somewhat deprecated.
