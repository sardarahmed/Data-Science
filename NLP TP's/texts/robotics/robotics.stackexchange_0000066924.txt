Q:

tf2 convert transform to msg

This should be a simple task:
#include <tf2/transform_datatypes.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/PoseStamped.h>

...
geometry_msgs::TransformStamped transform = anything;
geometry_msgs::PoseStamped pose;
tf2::convert(transform, pose);
...

So this code should convert the TransformStamped to PoseStamped (similar to tf::poseTFtoMsg).
But the compiler complains that toMsg and fromMsg aren't defined. IMO there are some includes missing. Where are toMsg and fromMsg for PoseStamped defined?

A:

If you are getting errors with missing definitions that means that you have do not have the correct headers included.
There are tutorials here: http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Migration/DataConversions
However you'll find that PoseStamped and TransformStamped do not have conversions defined between them because they contain different data. The convert method is designed for converting homogeneous datatypes between representations in different libraries. Any conversion must be reversible for it to work in this framework.
