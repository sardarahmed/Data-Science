Q:

Which unit of measurement does SetForce() use?

Hello evryone, I have a model of a quadrotor in matlab and to stabilize it at a fixed height I need a thrust of 6,3 N. I also have a simple model of the same quadrotor in gazebo controlled through a PD and it appears that the force applyed to stabilize it is 62.7, is it possible that the force is computed in 100*mN ??

A:

There is a ROS standard for that. It should be Newtons.
Perhaps that model is not in compliance with REP-0103?

didn't know about ROS standard but it seems that the model is still compliant with REP-0103.
