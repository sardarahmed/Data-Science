Q:

How to change the frame(fixed/target) of hokuyo node?

I use the launch file
 <launch>
    <node pkg="hokuyo_node" type="hokuyo_node" name="hokuyo_node">
        <remap from="/laser" to="/base_laser" />
    </node>
 </launch>

I run the command :
 rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find hokuyo_node`/hokuyo_test.vcg

It shows the frame /laser not /base_laser.

How to change it when run the launch file? Because in other nodes use the other name.

What difference between fixed and target frame?

Thank you~

A:

Hi,
I am not sure you can change a parameter using remap, you could change the name of a topic for example, in hokuyo_node you can change the topic "scan". Click here for more information
This topic publishes LaserScan messages, which contain an element called "frame_id" which is also a parameter of the node and it is set to "laser" by default.

To change this you can use the dynamic reconfigure
rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui

or set the parameter in the launch file adding the line
<param name="frame_id" value="/base_laser"/>

Check the rviz Coordinate Frames out
I hope this will help you!

(edit) After seen mbj's reply
Also you can change the Fixed frame, clicking and editing the text.

because you have to change it in both places, reconfigure_gui changes the frame_id in the LaserScan messages published and also change the fixed_frame in rviz (or in the .vcg file, which is the rviz configuration) which tells the program which frame_id is the "base" or the "world"

Why I use reconfigure_gui to change /laser to /base_laser, it doesn't work when I opne rviz : rosrun rviz rviz -d rospack find hokuyo_node/hokuyo_test.vcg ?
