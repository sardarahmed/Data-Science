A:

Ha!  I just came across this a few minutes ago and see that it has already been answered in this forum elsewhere.  The short answer is that there was a ROS package change that now requires a different command line than what is shown in the tutorials.  Try the following and it should work:
check_urdf my_robot.urdf  

"rosrun" and the package name are not required.
