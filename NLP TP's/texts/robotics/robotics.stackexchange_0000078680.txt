Q:

bash: /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash: No such file or directory

when ever I open a new terminal this message appears on the top every time
" bash: /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash: No such file or directory "
I'me working on ROS INDIGO and it's working pretty fine.. Yet I've no concern with ros kinetic so this message annoys me!
Please help me if I can get rid of this..!!
Thanks :-)

bash: /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash: No such file or directory
so am the beginer of ROS i am trying to install ROS but i am continuesly finding this error even though i had deleted the route line in the directory so please provide a solution

A:

You probably have a source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash line somewhere in your .bashrc (assuming you use bash as your shell).
Open $HOME/.bashrc, remove the line, save.

I've installed ROS INDIGO and got the same error.
Tried your solution too.
But "HOME/.bashrc" command isn't working either.
gives the following error
bash: HOME/.bashrc: No such file or directory

It's $HOME, not HOME (note the dollar sign).
But in any case: Indigo and Kinetic don't install on the same system, so I'm curious to know what you have done exactly?

Thank you very much. Problem Solved.
Basically go to home directory then press ctrl+h then you can see hidden files then search for .bashrc and remove the lines.

i tried the same, but its showing Permission Denied. Please help
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-08-30:
@AnirudhTopiwala: your problem is most likely more a Linux problem than a ROS problem. But "permission denied" errors seem to suggest you are trying to edit another user's .bashrc. You probably don't have permission to do that.

Dear Users, I had a very similar problem, $HOME gave error. I found out this and it fixed the problem: execute gedit ~/.bashrc. On bottom in file, there is source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash . Just delete that code and save. (note: the ROS distro might differ in your case). reopen terminal.

I got the same error, I tried to use gedit ~/.bashrc, after I see the file empty. Currently, I installed the Melodic ubuntu17.

* vi /.bashrc
* at end of line i could find "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" along with "export DISPLAY" 5 times since i faced the error so reinstalled 5 times but could not solve the problem
