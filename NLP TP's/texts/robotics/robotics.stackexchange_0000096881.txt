Q:

Using simulator for turtlebot before actual robot testing

Hi All,
I am looking to carry out testing through simulation for my Turtlebot3 robot, before I run the packages for my actual robot, just to see if any issues arise etc. I have the packages ready to go (launch file, python files etc.).
I just have a few questions:

How do I bring up a simulator of my Turtlebot Waffle-pi version? (Do I use Rviz?). I should know this, but my training so far has just been with the Turtlebot and having the movement of the robot shown on Rviz, I have not actually simulated any movement as of yet.
If I have a map of my lab, can I upload that to the simulation to carry out the simulated testing? Or can I only use pre-constructed maps from ROS libraries? I only need a 2D map for now and I have multiple maps built using my Turtlebot3 and SLAM.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
I am using ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04LTS, along with the Turtlebot3 Waffle-pi version.

A:

I suggest working through:

Robotis e-manual on the Turtlebot 3.
ROS Navigation 2 tutorials

Questions you pose should be covered. If not, you can try to narrow the scope of your questions, so the community can help as appropriate.
