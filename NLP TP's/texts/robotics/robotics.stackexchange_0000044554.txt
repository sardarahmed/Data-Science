Q:

Are there useful utilities for visualizing rosgraphs?

--Just in case there are others, and for those who may have missed some of the tools that do exist--

Are there any useful tools to help visualize a ROS computation graph?
(Or to generate nice pictures for papers based on these graphs?)

A:

I've seen that people use rxgraph, but often don't realize they can also use xdot to generate images from a saved .dot file.
roslaunch somepkg somefilename.launch
rxgraph -o somefilename.dot
rosrun xdot xdot.py somefilename.dot

(And you can edit somefilename.dot in realtime which I think is a useful way to generate figures that fit the needs of a paper or a presentation.)
