Q:

Adding encoders to Nomad 4WD

i have a nomad 4wd rover kit but i saw that motors doesn't have encoders. But to use odometry with ros i need it. I cannot found any suggestion on google search, so i ask here if someone could route me to some solutions.
thanks

A:

This is the Actobotics Nomad chassis kit, I assume.
I did this with another Actobotics kit. Buy two extra motors of the same type with encoders, and use these for the rear motors. Get the ones with the same gearbox.
These are the motors that come with the kit.
Here are the original motors.
Here are the ones with encoders.
