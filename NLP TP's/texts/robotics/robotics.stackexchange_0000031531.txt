Q:

make eclipse-project in stack

Hi !
I'm a beginner in ros, and I'm trying to develop ROS code using Eclipse.
My question is, recently I have created a repository in github with a ros stack, and inside of this ros stack I have some packages. I would like to import all the stack like a single project, but I'm not able to do a "make eclipse-project" with the stack.
So I can import as a project all the packages and it work perfectly but I don't know if is possible to import all the stack in one eclipse project.
Any one have done this ?
How do you develop multiple packages using a IDE ? you open a project for each package and put dependencies between them ?

Btw, could you reword your title/headline into a question? It makes the issue clearer when browsing headlines, and fits the question answer model better.

The idea of packages is, that they are relatively independent of each other. Usually they only interface either by linking of libraries or by ros messages. What advantage would it be, to have a single eclipse project? See also: http://www.ros.org/wiki/Stacks

A:

I use Eclipse and to work on several packages at once, I simply make projects for each individually, and open them into my workspace. Eclipse will find and open all project under any directory you give it which works well for a stack if you've made Eclipse projects for each with make eclipse-project
AFAIK, neither Eclipse nor CMake can auto-detect other eclipse projects to link them automatically
