Q:

nao camera wrapper node

Hi all,
I'm trying to get a ROS node running, which should publish the images grabbed by the cameras of the Nao robot (latest generation, H25 with Intel ATOM CPU). Therefore I'm using the Aldebaran C++ API.
First, I tried to use the NAO-ROS camera driver from Brown Uni, but it didn't work in my case either. This link reports the problem:
http://answers.ros.org/question/1864/nao-teleop-and-camera-feed
So when writing an own wrapper node for the cameras, I tried to integrate the necessary Aldebaran API functions according to Aldebaran's API docu. The node should work remotely, so it is not loaded onto the robot.
My wrapper node compiles, but it crashes with segmentation fault immadiately at run time.
I'm using image_transport of ROS, and I'm sure the ROS part of the code works fine as I used the concept with a simple webcam before without problems. However, I think the problem lies within the Aldebaran API and libraries. As soon as they are included, the node still compiles, but crashes at run time.
Has anyone a solution or useful hints to this problem?
Thank you.

A:

I just wrote a small ROS python wrapper for Nao's camera. You can find it in our nao_driver package (see http://www.ros.org/wiki/nao_driver).
