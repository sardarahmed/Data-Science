Q:

How do you rotate the camera view around a model

Is there any way to rotate the camera around a model by dragging the mouse, especially when editing a model?
I can't find any documentation for Gazebo's mouse and keyboard shortcuts, and playing around with the mouse, I've found I can only pan the view by clicking the dragging, and zooming the view with the mouse scroll bar. I can't find any way to "orbit" around a point, which is a common feature in most CAD systems. Is this possible in Gazebo?
Also, most annoyingly, if I double-click any object, the view immediately switches to a high-up perspective that doesn't let me see any detail, and since I can't rotate the view at all, the only way I can fix it is by going to View->Reset Camera. Why does double clicking a model screw up the camera view?

A:

You can orbit the view dragging the mouse wheel pressed. You could also left-click drag while holding the Shift key.
Double-clicking a model to zoom in it is a useful feature in several occasions, for example if you have a world with several objects, maybe even moving, and you want to quickly move the view to one of them. But it's true that it might not be useful for every use case, so I created an issue to add an option to turn off this behaviour.

Thanks. I'm on a laptop, so I don't have a mouse wheel to press, so I never thought to try that, but the left-click+shift works perfectly.

It definitely works! Funny thing is that in the tutorial they did not cover such a basic operation for rotation :)
