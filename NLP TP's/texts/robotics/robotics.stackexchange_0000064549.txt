Could you plz state what is not working (error message, command you attempted to run, or something)...
Comment by mark_vision on 2014-12-10:
The error is just there's no executable. So if I run rosrun topic_tools transform <some parameters> it says could not find executable. The list of executables include : mux_<something>, relay, throttle and drop

Ok, just checked, the issue is valid for my system, too;) running hydro on Ubuntu 12.04; no "transform" executable in the anywhere ros installation folder /opt/ros/hydro while throttle, mux, relay etc. are there in /opt/ros/hydro/lib/topic_tools folder

It appears the transform tool was added in commit ede12dbb on the indigo-devel branch. You could try building the indigo-devel branch of ros_comm in your workspace to try and add this functionality to Hydro.

Ok, is it then correct that transform is still shown in the wiki, even if I switch to hydro doc (http://wiki.ros.org/topic_tools)?

A:

As @jarvisschultz stated in the comment transform tool was first added to the indigo-devel branch, therefore is not available under ROS hydro and previous versions....
