I don't know the visualization tool you are using, but did you try to simply zoom out? From the images you posted I see few spare points, maybe the cloud is too large to fit the screen.

No these spare points are boundry box points not cloud points

A:

It admittedly takes a bit of experience to find a working setup.
Take a look at these hints.
Seeing your picture, I suggest to make sure that the marker pattern is completely planar. If all fails, you can adjust the 'marker_dist_threshold' parameter as described in the page linked above.
