Q:

ARIAC Installation Instructions

Hello! I'm trying to install the ARIAC simulator on ROS Kinetic + Gazebo 7 + Ubuntu 16.04, both installed from apt. The installation instructions suggest binaries, but I didn't see any indication of where to obtain them, so I attempted to compile from source. I ran into a protobuf conflict between the protobuf version used to compile the Gazebo 7 apt package and the version required for tensorflow, and tried recompiling the Gazebo protobuf to match. Unfortunately, I think that introduced more problems:
[ 73%] Building CXX object ariac/gear_example/CMakeFiles/gear_example_node.dir/src/gear_example_node.cpp.o

       private: void OnPoseMsg(ConstPosePtr &_msg);

I assume that if I want to use a version of protobuf that supports tensorflow I'll have to recompile Gazebo from source. Does Gazebo support Protobuf 3.0?
Better still would be instructions on how to obtain to ARIAC binaries so I didn't have to try to sort out the protobuf mismatch.
Thanks

A:

I have updated the ARIAC tutorials including the command for installing the ariac package.
Gazebo 7 supports protobuf3, but you would have to recompile it from source.
An alternative solution would be to create a docker container for having two separate isolated environments. You then choose where to run what :)

Thank you very much. I switched to protobuf 2.6 for building ARIAC and put tensorflow inside nvidia-docker and everything worked just fine.

That was fast!
