How to uninstall ROS on Windows

The ROS on windows installation is giving an error on ros-catkin-tools. I want to uninstall and make a fresh install of ROS on windows, should i just delete the c:/opt/ros folder?

Anyone figure this out yet?

A:

I guess it is not the best way but worked for me.
choco uninstall ros-melodic-desktop_full

After this Chocolatey still said ROS is installed so I removed chocolatey too.
Then I deleted the Chocolatey Folder: (https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/Uninstallation)
You can find it under C:\ProgramData\chocolatey
After this steps I followed the (http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows) introduction but started at the Chocolatey installation.

I've uninstalled everything but there's still a lot of data in c:\opt\ros\melodic\x64. Do i delete this before re-installig or just leave it alone?

I think you can delete it and start a new installation.
Did it work?
