Q:

how to include custom libraries

Hi everyone,
I have a library(in C++) and I can compile and use it without ROS. It's a TCP/IP communication library. I want to listen those msgs and publish/use them in ROS. I know how to modify the cpp file to publish those msgs. But I don't know how to compile all together in ROS. So far, I found that I need to include target_link_libraries in CMakeList.txt file, but could not get it working. Let's say, my library sitting in home/ros_workspace/my_lib how should I modify the CMakeList.txt file?
Thanks

ADD_LIBRARY( yourlibrary_name STATIC your_file_hpp_and_cpp )
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES( yourlibrary_name libraries_needed_by_your_library )
create node with your library
rosbuild_add_executable(the_node_name src/file1.cpp ... src/filen.cpp )
target_link_libraries(the_node_name  yourlibrary_name)
or simply add everything in rosbuild_add_executable(.....
