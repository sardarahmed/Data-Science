how to convert my CAD files to .xml format so that ROS recognizes it?

I have modeled an environment using a CAD software. I would like to convert this CAD model into .xml format so that the ROS recognizes it. Suggestions would be helpful.

Thanks for your reply. But this exporter is not functioning well. When i export my file as an URDF , it shuts the entire solid works. Do you know/ have any other better Solid Works to URDF exporter file?  I am ok with exporting .xml files from other CAD softwares too like AutoCAD , Pro-E , CATIA and Inventor. Thanks in advance
