Q:

catkin_make_isolated: which has been found in [path] but it is not a catkin package

I am building from source with an isolated catkin workspace. I wonder why it throws "not a catkin package", although catkin_make_isolated is supposed to build plain cmake projects, too.

Which version of ROS are you using? Which version of eigen_conversions are you trying to build? I ask because it looks like orocos_kdl moved from a catkin package to a cmake package between Groovy and Hydro.

A:

catkin_make_isolated is fine to build packages which are not catkin packages.
Your problem is that you cannot use a CATKIN_DEPENDS on a non-catkin package. You have to use DEPENDS. catkin CMakeLists.txt documentation
