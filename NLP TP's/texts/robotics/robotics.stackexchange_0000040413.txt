Q:

Simple test if Ros was installed correctly?

hello,
warning I am a newbie. I followed the instructions on the ros website for installation on ubuntu. I believe everything worked but I was wondering if there is a command or easy tutorial to check if I installed everything correctly.
thanks

Great, everything is working thank you for the help (:

A:

Try typing
rosversion ros

in a terminal. If it gives you a version number, ROS is installed. :)

I was going to suggest running 'roscore', and seeing what happened. Same result.

@Mac Yeah ! good alternative, even rospack find  would do the job.

rosversion ros yields  <unversioned> for me. What does it mean?

For rosversion I get : Cannot locate.
roscore: command not found.
What should i do?

This does not work for new ROS versions, try using just
rosversion -d
