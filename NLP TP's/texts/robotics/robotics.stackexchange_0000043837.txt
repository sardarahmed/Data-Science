Q:

Could I execute smach in c++?

Hi,
I've made a state machine, but I need to compile it into c++, because I need to execute in the Nao.
Is there a way to execute Smach in Nao using python?.
Thanks.

Have you looked into http://www.aldebaran-robotics.com/documentation/dev/python/index.html ?

A:

@Loy's answer to just run Python on the NAO looks like the right solution. SMACH is a pure python library. Though there have been implementations of SMACH semantics in other languages, there is no native implementation that I know of in c/c++.
