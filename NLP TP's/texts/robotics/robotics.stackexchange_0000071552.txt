Q:

No definition of [procps] for OS [osx]

I'm trying to install ROS indigo from the website's instructions for my Mac. When I get to the section for resolving dependencies, I get the following error message:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
opencv_apps: No definition of [procps] for OS [osx]

Does anyone know how to fix this?

A:

procps is a linux-only package, and won't install on OSX.
That said, there shouldn't be anything in ROS that depends on it. You should do two things:

Put a file named CATKIN_IGNORE in the opencv_apps package, so that catkin doesn't try to build it. Obviously this doesn't get you a complete install, but you should be able to proceed.
You may also need to run rosdep with the --skip-keys=procps option to make it ignore the bad dependency.
File this as a bug against opencv_apps on their issue tracker. Any package which is included in the default installation of ROS should work on both OSX and Linux.

There is an existing issue for this: https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/issues/106

This has been fixed upstream, and the fix is released in version 1.11.11 of the opencv_apps package.
