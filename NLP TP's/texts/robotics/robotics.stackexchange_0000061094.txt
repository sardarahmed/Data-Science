Q:

Too fast circling during the localization

When with rviz i inform the estimate localization, the robot start by circling very fasly. It is too fast, and may be dangerous. So how can I decrease the speed?
I tried to reduce in the base_local_params_planner the acc_lim_th et the max_rotationnal_vel, but it doesn't work.

What exactly are you doing? The "2D Pose Estimate" button in rviz should not move the robot at all.

I'm doing 2D Pose Estimate and 2D Nav Goal in rviz

A:

Just some sanity checks: Set the rotational recovery to false and see if that rotation stops. Also, try to manually move the robot around to check if it localizes in the map properly.
PS - I have also noticed that in if you reduce the max x and theta velocities below a certain limit, the robot tends to rotate. I do not know what causes this behavior.
