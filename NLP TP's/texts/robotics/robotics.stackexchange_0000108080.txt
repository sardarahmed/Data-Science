Q:

I'm getting an error when trying to install ROS

I get the same error every time I follow the steps to install Ros. Even though I tried different codes and gpt's solutions, none of them worked. I even deleted Ubuntu and reinstalled it. I would be happy if you help.
~$ sudo apt update

A:

It seems you are trying to install ros-noetic (ROS 1) to Ubuntu-22 (jammy) Which is not supported. Try installing ros-humble (ROS 2) instead.
