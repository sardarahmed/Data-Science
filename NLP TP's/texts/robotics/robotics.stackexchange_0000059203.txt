Q:

Cannot move PTU46 on Fuerte

Hi,
my robot has a Flir PTU46 ( http://wiki.ros.org/ptu46 ).
I'm using this Ros node https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/wu_ptu in order to use it.
Unfortunately, when I try to public a /ptu/cmd the PTU never moves.
Has anybody used this PTU?
Thanks in advance

Solved with
rostopic pub -1 /ptu/cmd sensor_msgs/JointState '{ header: {frame_id: '' }, name: ['tilt,pan'], position: [-0,-0], velocity: [0.6,0.6], effort: [1,1]}'
