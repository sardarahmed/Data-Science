Q:

Will a 5200mAh 30C 22.2V 6S Lipo battery work with

I am building a Quadcopter and I was wondering if a 5200mAh 30C 22.2V 6S Lipo battery will work with a 40Amp Esc's, MT4108 370 KV Motors, and GEMFAN 1470 Carbon Fiber Props. The over all payload will be about 5-6 pounds.

A:

Your motors are rated for 466W max, which with a 6S battery gives about 20A max current draw per motor (This also tells you your ESC are a good choice, provided that they can handle the 6S voltage).
I'd estimate the hover voltage at about 10A, so you'd get a flight duration of t = Capacity(C) / Current(I) = 5.2/40 = 0.13h = 7.8mins.
This flight duration sounds a bit small. I'd try something that would get me to 10+minutes, depending on application.
That said, the correct way to approach this, would be to get some real data from your power system, either experimentally or online. The course of action is:
(1) Set a bench test with one propeller and motor fixed on a thrust bench or scale.
(2) Run your motor to the maximum and record the current $I_{max}$. This will verify the motor and ESC maximum specs.
(3) Run your motor to produce thrust equal to 1/4 of the estimated quadrotor weight. This will give you your hover current, $I_H$.
(4) Use $I_H$ and your required flight time to calculate the required battery capacity.
