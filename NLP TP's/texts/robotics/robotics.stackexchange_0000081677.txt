Q:

Unable build ABB YuMi Support

I am new to the ROS systems and have come to a dead stop, can someone with experience assist.
System so far:

Ubuntu VM 16.04.2 Kinetic
ROS installed and builds
ROS-I core builds
gazebo works
gazebo_ros_pkgs builds

cloned package from https://github.com/OrebroUniversity/yumi
When I build I get warnings and errors errors:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:166 (message):

  'gazebo_ros_INCLUDE_DIRS' nor 'gazebo_ros_LIBRARIES' is defined.

I am obviously missing something, can anyone help.

rosdep check --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic
System dependencies have not been satisified:
ERROR[yumi_hw]: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [abb_rws_interface]
OS name    : ubuntu
OS version : xenial

A:

The latest version of that package depends on unreleased software (abb_rws_interface). It appears that the changes that introduced that dependency were merged into master by accident.
21833bb1 reverts that, so master should build again.
See also OrebroUniversity/yumi#15 for a related issue.

Thanks for the feedback I can now build once the master was reverted.
