Is it a problem with my ROS installation? I tried rosdep install liblog4cxx, but it did not find anything.

Did this ever get solved? I'm having the same problem. Thanks.

A:

rosdep install liblog4cxx is not the correct syntax (confusing I know). You'd need to do rosdep install beginner_tutorials (this only works if beginner_tutorials is on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH) or rosdep install --from-paths /home/testros/catkin_ws/src to install all dependencies for all packages in your catkin workspace.

Doesn't seem to change anything. I tried:
rosdep check beginner_tutorials: All system dependencies have been satisified
rosdep resolve log4cxx: #apt liblog4cxx10-dev
rosdep what-needs log4cxx: rosconsole
rosdep where-defined log4cxx: raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/base.yaml

I don't know then, it seems something is suggesting the file /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblog4cxx.so should be linked against, but it doesn't seem to exist. You can check to see if that file exists and if it does not look at the files installed by the liblog4cxx10-dev deb.
