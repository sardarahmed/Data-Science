Good question! It's a shame nobody seems to know the answer... maybe it would help to figure out how the simulated Prosilica pattern projector on the PR2 works (it seems to be "kind of" a light source, right?)

There is a gazebo_plugin called gazebo_ros_projector that looks like it may perform this function.  It appears to add an extra rendering pass to the scene to aplly such a texture.

A:

See http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/4759/attach-spotlights-to-robot-links-in-gazebo-19-ros/ and https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/900/allow-attachment-of-lights-to-links
It looks like it has been recently added (updating this mid 2017), though I'm not sure which version of gazebo and ROS it will be available in (compiling gazebo from source could address that).
