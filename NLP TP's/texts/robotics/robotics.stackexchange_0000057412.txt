Q:

Can't receive topic in node

I am trying to use 3 prime sense sensor in both depth an image mode. Since one USB bus cannot handle the load I'm trying to use two computers. I have setup the network in a way that I think works, but my nodes on one computer can't receive message published on the other. I can see them in rostopic echo every thing is right but node never receives the message. Any ideas?
