Q:

Groovy and gazebo

Hello
I have groovy version installed on Ubuntu 12.04. Now, I will like to install and know which gazebo version is recomended with groovy or if I have to use other Ros version. Any sugestions?
Also, maybe I will like to add simbody engine later.
Thank you very much in advance.

A:

Gazebo 1.7.13 is packaged within ROS Groovy as the simulator_gazebo stack. You can install it on Ubuntu by running:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-simulator-gazebo

Groovy does not use the system-wide installation Gazebo.
