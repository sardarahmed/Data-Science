How to solve this problem

A:

I think this could be a relevant issue: https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/issues/1440

The main issue for me was the point
cloud fields. It doesn't work when I
have the intensity field. My map only
worked after I removed the intensity
field.
