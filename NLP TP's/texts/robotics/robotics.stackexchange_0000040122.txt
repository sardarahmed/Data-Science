Q:

rosjava_core tutorial error in source

Hi
I wanted to run rosjava_tutorial_pubsub and rosjava_tutorial_services in eclipse. These need the project rosjava. But there is an error in the source code. In the src/test/java, int the org.ros package in ParameterServerTestNode.java
At line number 112 it gives this error: The method setInt32Array(List) in the type TestArrays is not applicable for the arguments (int[])
Just to let you know.
