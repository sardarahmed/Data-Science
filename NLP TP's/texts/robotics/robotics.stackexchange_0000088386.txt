Q:

ROS_CanOpen Ixxat USB to can converter

Hello,
I want to use ros_canopen package to communicate via can. The communication should be done via a USB to can converter from the company Ixxat. Which steps are necessary to use the converter?
Thanks for your answer.

A:

Looks like Ixxat supports SocketCAN for some devices.
If you can use that, everything should work as usual.
If not, you could provide your own driver plugin for canopen_motor_node (for motor drives).
Unfortunately, there is still no support for these plugins in the bridge nodes (Issue).

Thanks for your answer. The SocketCan driver works. But if I want to compile the canopen package via catkin, then I get an error.
/usr/include/c++/5/bits/hashtable_policy.h: error: no match for call to '(const std::hashcanopen::motorbase::operationmode) ...
Followed by many other errors..

Are you sure you are compiling the kinetic-devel branch? Not the melodic-devel one?

where can i see this? and where can I get the right version?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-08-17:
If you've cloned the repository using git clone, then a git status or git branch should show you which particular branch is currently checked out.
If you've downloaded a zip from github, the branch name should be part of the filename.

Also: please make sure you actually have to build the packages yourself. Otherwise just use apt to install them.

Thanks for your answer. I downloaded it now as a correct zip file and then it works. When I clone it, it always downloads the melodic version.
Thanks!

When I clone it, it always downloads the melodic version.

No, it downloads all versions, but melodic-devel is the default branch, so that one is 'active'.
You'll need to checkout the correct branch.
But again: make sure you actually need to build things from source.
