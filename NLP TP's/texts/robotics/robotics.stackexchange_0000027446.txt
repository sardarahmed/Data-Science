Q:

getCoG() returns (0, 0, 0)

Hi
I am trying to find center of mass by doing the following

std::cout << this->model->GetLink("leg1")->GetInertial()->GetCoG() << std::endl;

but I only get 0,0,0. Is there any reason why it's happening? Maybe the reference frame is the link it self, instead of the world frame?

A:

Correct, the center of mass is expressed with respect to the link, and the link pose with respect to the parent model.
