Q:

Cluster recognition and identifying objects, trouble using SHOTColor, help?

I was using VFH for object detection, now I need some colour information about the point cloud that I will use, I don't know how to use SHOTColor properly, could you guys give me a light?
I used the following tutorial from the pointclouds.org:
http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/vfh_recognition.php
And I tried to make a adapted version for the SHOTColor, using only the descriptor, here it is the reference:
http://docs.pointclouds.org/1.7.1/structpcl_1_1_s_h_o_t1344.html
Hence, how can I make a comparison of the colour information and make a tree using the FLANN to compare and identify the objects?
Specifically, the rf[9] vector of pcl::SHOT1344, any help would be much appreciated
I'm trying to do it with real time recognition using rviz

A:

You can check this. Application may be similar with pcl::SHOT352 descriptor.
