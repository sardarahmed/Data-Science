Q:

how to save Vlp-16 results

Hi everyone I am new in Ros and Lidar.
My project is finding humans in VLP-16 lidar output.
To do that, I have a camera and vlp-16. I need to save images from camera and data from VLP-16. Then I will label corresponding pixels and train them with a ML algorithm.
I am saving images from camera with system time name (30 fps), and I want to save VLP-16 output with x,y,z and intensity.
But I could not find how to save VLP-16 output data into a file.
I would be thankful if you could help me about it.

Hi everyone
My project is similar to eneski's, it is necessary to synchronize the data of VLP-16 and image. However,I don't know how to save Synchronous data.I have successfully installed velodyne /ROS-drivers and it can work normally.
@eneski :Have you saved the data successfully?   Thanks

A:

The usual method for saving ROS messages for later processing is via the rosbag record command.
For velodyne data, it's better to record the /velodyne_packets topic published by the driver. Those messages contain all the data that are subsequently published as a point cloud, but in much more compact form.
For your camera images, you may want to consider saving their compressed format:

Thaks for your answer,
I have one more question:
Can I get only distance(z) for each frame? Do you know how to do that?
Comment by eneski on 2017-04-12:
I just want to write all z distance to a file and then I will process them. Because x and y are obviously known, I don't really need them.

I don't quite understand your subsequent question. Please open a new question for that, and try to explain it more clearly.
Comment by eneski on 2017-04-13:
my question is special for you, I'm thinking that you made or ( at least know ) this ( http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~piyushk/courses/spr12/slides/Week6b-print.pdf ) presentation. I just want to know how to run the subscriber.cc in the example. I would be very glad if you could help me.

@piyushk made that for a class lecture and assignment. His students were expected to write and run the subscriber based on the hints provided.
