Q:

Difference between odometry and localization wrt determining robot's pose?

AFAIK, localization is used to determine a robot's pose from a given a map and sensor data. I know of statistical localization approaches which use particle filters to determine a robot's location within a map.
But doesn't odometry also do the same thing using a different technique? That is, it just uses sensor data to estimate the position (and velocity) of a robot using geometric methods instead of statistical methods?
In other words, aren't both odometry and localization determining the pose of the robot? Is the difference that odometry doesn't need a map, but localization does?

A:

Odometry is the task of calculating where the robot has traveled w.r.t. the robot's previous pose using sensors that measure actuator output (motor encoders, for example.) Localization is the task of placing a robot inside of a pre-defined map. These tasks are often intertwined, but they don't require each other to complete robot positioning. The key here is that there is no map involved with odometry. The odometer on your car is doing odometry - the sensors keep track of how many miles have been driven. You can't reliably calculate the pose of a car using the odometer, but you are still doing odometry. Some cars use GPS to match the location of the car to a map. This does not need an odometer, but odometers do help in correcting errors in GPS sensors. The accelerometer can be used to detect if the car is still moving or not regardless of what the GPS says. I hope this helps clarify things for you.
