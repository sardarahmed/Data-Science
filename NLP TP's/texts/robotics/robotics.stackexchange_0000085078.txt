A question without a question, isn't really a question.

A:

See if /home/makerhan/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache/index already exists, or exists but permissions are incorrect on it (maybe wrongly running sudo rosdep update creates this problem?).
If it doesn't exist try:
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update

http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu#Initialize_rosdep
(if it does already exist, maybe delete it first then run rosdep steps again)
I'm just guessing, maybe later I'll try deleting my own and seeing if the same error comes up and update this.
https://answers.ros.org/question/175599/rosdep-update-permission-error/ looks related.

I had a similar problem (I'm pretty sure I did sudo rosdep update at somepoint last week). Doing rosdep update fixed it for me. Thanks
