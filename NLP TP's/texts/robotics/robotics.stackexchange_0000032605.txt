Q:

Passing Arugments to a Rosjava Node

How do you pass arguments to a rosjava node?
In the examples,  org.ros.RosRun is used to instantiate the node.  Only a NodeConfiguration is passed to this new node and the NodeConfiguration does not contain the command line arguments.

A:

There's a todo in NodeConfiguration for that. Please file an issue and star it if you'd like to track progress on this feature.
In the meantime, I suggest using rosparam.
