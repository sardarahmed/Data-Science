Q:

Unable to access the package in rosws

Hi,
Im running on Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS fuerte.
I want to calibrate 2 individual cameras as a stereocamera.
I created an overlay using rosws in my home folder and then added several packages like uvc_camera, usb_cam, camera_umd and the stack mage_pipleine using the command rosws set  --git
After that i resourced the new setup.bash within my workspace.
When i tried to access my package camera_calibration inside the image_pipeline stack using roscd camera_calibration command, it went to the one in my /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/image_pipeline/camera_calibration instead of the one in my workspace associated with rosws.
This problem is only for this package, while i am able to access the other packages in my rosws using roscd.
I also checked the .rosintall file in my local workspace, it listed down all these entries.
Also i tried to install the dependencies of the camera_calibration packages using rosdep install camera_calibration and I am getting the error
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
camera_calibration: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [sensor_msgs]
Could anyone kindly help me in resolving this.
Thanks in advance.

Thanks for your reply.
I did that too but in vain.
Please note that, it is working for all the other packages in the same workspace and does not work only for the camera_calibration.
My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set to
/home/hari/fuerte/image_pipeline:/home/hari/fuerte/camera_umd:/home/hari/fuerte/uvc_

Not sure why you name your own package with a same name as in the original stacks.. Could you pls try change your package name?

A:

overlaying in fuerte works by searching for packages in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. You can investigate it by typing:
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

The first thing to check when your overlaying package is not found where it should it the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. The second thing to check is the exact spelling of the name of the package. Often, '-' and '_' are mixed up.
Finally try running
rospack profile

rospack caches locations of packages, and this rebuilds the cache.
The rosdep problem is unrelated and may better be asked in a separate question, or a ticket on the camera_calibration package.
