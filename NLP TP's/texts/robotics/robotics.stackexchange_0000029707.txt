Q:

Orocos components can not be compiled

Hello,
I am getting an error while compiling rtt orocos-toolchain package. I tried to reinstall latest updates from repository but seems it is still not working.

A:

The 'official' installation instructions are available on orocos.org (http://www.orocos.org/wiki/orocos/toolchain/getting-started) and contains a link to the orocos_toolchain_ros stack. In order to solve the error message you have, a couple of questions:

are you sure you're working directory is clean? I see folder names like /tag/-0.1.5... That's definitely not the latest version of the stack. Ruben released the 0.2.1 version last week.
which ROS distribution are you using? As of diamondback, there are differences in the orocos_toolchain_ros stack between cturtle and diamondback. If you're using our git repository, use the cturtle branch for cturtle and the diamondback (or master) branch for diamondback.
What platform are you working on?
Which boost version are you using?

regards,
Steven
