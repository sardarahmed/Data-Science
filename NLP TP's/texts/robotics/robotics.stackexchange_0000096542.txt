Did it work for you at all? When I select the 'TF tree', I got:
service not available, waiting again...

Same as OP no TF Tree option
Foxy - "rqt --clear-config" did nothing

I had a similar issue on humble
It worked after I installed ros-humble-tf2-tools and ros-humble-rqt-tf-tree and executed rqt --clear-config
