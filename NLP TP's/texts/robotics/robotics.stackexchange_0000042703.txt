Q:

ROS RGBD SLAM Problem

Hi I am using ubuntu 11.10 with ROS electric and Kinect.
when i run the application, it works fine in pause state. Upon processing, it results in exit with following message.
bool g2o::HyperGraphActionLibrary::registerAction(g2o::HyperGraphElementAction*): creating collection for "writeGnuplot"
bool g2o::HyperGraphActionLibrary::registerAction(g2o::HyperGraphElementAction*): creating collection for "draw"

It works good with roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch

A:

The only relevant information is this:
[rgbdslam-1] process has died [pid 2800, exit code -11]. log files: /home/vision-lab/.ros/log/fb3c4690-d763-11e1-aad7-f80f4113f0b0/rgbdslam-1.log

Signal 11 roughly means that a memory segment is accessed that doesn't belong to the process. You probably need to run it in a debugger to get to the source of this error.
How do you start it? A standard launch file? A custom one?
