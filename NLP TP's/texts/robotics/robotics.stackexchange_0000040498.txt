Q:

dynamixel_motor debs in Fuerte

As far as I can tell, the dynamixel_motor stack is not being released as debs for fuerte. Is fuerte not going to release these stacks as debs anymore, and we should be checking them out ourselves, or is it just not packaged yet?

John, I haven't had a chance to test out dynamixel_motor stack with Fuerte yet, hence there are no debs yet. I should have some more time later this week, I will try and push a Fuerte release then. If anybody wants to do a source checkout and try it with Fuerte, that would be great. I don't really anticipate any major problems, since it has pretty minimal ROS dependencies.
Update: the trunk of dynamixel_motor stack is now Fuerte compatible, I also did a release into Fuerte, but it will take some time before it's built and the main repo is updated to include the debs.

Thanks, If I can get to it before you do I'll verify that it works. We are experiencing some other upgrade difficulties right now, so it may be a few days.

@John Hoare: dynamixel_motor stack should be Fuerte compatible now.
