Q:

Error: couldn't find dependency [gazebo_msgs] of [pr2_tabletop_manipulation_gazebo_demo]

Hi I tried to get the PR2 Pick and Place Demo working. In the compiling part after running "rosmake pr2_tabletop_manipulation_gazebo_demo" I got this out put:
root@reza2-laptop:~/Downloads# rosmake pr2_tabletop_manipulation_gazebo_demo

I have Cturtle installed on Ubuntu 10.04 and already installed arm-navigation for using ompl by:
 sudo apt-get install ros-cturtle-arm-navigation 

I have for example gazebo_msgs but it is under fuerte installation. So is there is any general package missing in my cturtle here or shall I get those missing dependencies one by one? Thanks in advance.

A:

Crossing cturtle and fuerte is likely going to get you into trouble.  It looks like you're missing gazebo_msgs from your environment.
