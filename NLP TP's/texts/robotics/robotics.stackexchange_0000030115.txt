Q:

How to compile opencv with camera

Hello, I try to compile my old projection with opencv. And about connecting camera, I try run code, and to run this node, I should open the camera stream. so I try rosrun usb_cam, which open the Logitech Quick-cam. But I have no idea about how to get this camera stream to link the my own node.
and this is my rxgraph:
C:\fakepath\Screenshot.png
and also my rostopic list as belows:
/image_topic
/image_topic_2
/image_topic_2/compressed
/image_topic_2/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/image_topic_2/compressed/parameter_updates
/image_topic_2/theora
/image_topic_2/theora/parameter_descriptions
/image_topic_2/theora/parameter_updates
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/usb_cam/camera_info
/usb_cam/image_raw
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates
Any one can help me? and I aim to build my own opecv-projection on ROS system.
Best wishes!

A:

Could you publish your rxgraph screenshot again with the show all topic marked? It seems that you need to remap the topic upon launching your node. More info here.
something like:
rosrun <your_package_name> <exec_name> image:=/usb_cam/image

Yeah, i got it. I should edit  my own subscriber, and most of image processes are in subscriber file. Thanks for raphael favier and KoenBuys.

Yongqiang, in your code, you want to subscribe to a topic named "image_topic". Your usb_cam node sends an image topic named "image". Following Koen's advice, you need to tell your node to subscribe to "image" in spite of "image_topic". Do this like this: $rosrun ros_opencv example image_topic:=image

As "http://www.ros.org/wiki/cv_bridge/Tutorials/UsingCvBridgeToConvertBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImages", should I input the command as :$rosrun ros_opencv example image:=/usb_cam/image_raw? I find that it doesn't connect between the node of "usb_cam" and the node of "image_converter", more advice?
