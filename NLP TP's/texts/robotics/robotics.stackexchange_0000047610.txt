Q:

Transform between /openni_depth_frame and /camera_link

Hi
I'm a bit confused since I'm new to ROS. I'm using the openni_tracker and ar_kinect packages together. Rviz complains that it can't transform from any of the skeleton topics (e.g. /head1) to /camera_depth_optical_frame (which is the fixed frame).
So I'm wondering how do I transform from /openni_depth_frame to /camera_link? /openni_depth_frame is the root of the tf tree for the skeleton produced by openni_tracker and /camera_link is the root of the tf tree for ar_kinect.
This is the output from "rosrun tf view_frames" so you can see the tf's that are running.
Any help would be much appreciated :)

A:

My guess is that camera_depth_frame and openni_depth_frame are the same. You could test that with a static transform broadcaster between the two set to identity.
I'm not sure if there are any configuration options that will give you consistent frames.

Cheers mate, you're right. I changed the root frame in openni_tracker from /openni_depth_frame to /camera_depth_frame and the transformations now work and look right in Rviz
