Q:

Gazebo Example(Template) Code and using Gazebo API

Can someone kindly give me some example codes using only Gazebo(without ROS) making advantage of the GAZEBO API?
I want to learn these API by examples because I really don't know how to make good use of Gazebo API and find out what I really want(any suggestions?). For example, how to apply joint force to a model using codes(NOT GAZEBO GUI)? How to place models in random places in Gazebo, etc.
I will appreciate any advice! :)

A:

I think it's a good way to download the gazebo source code and read it. This is a better way to learn to use GAZEBO API.
As for applying joint effort, I can use controller_manager provided by ROS and there is tutorial.
