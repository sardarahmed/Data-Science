Q:

data format of /scan

Hi all,
I'm using ROS INDIGO. I used depthimage_to_laserscan to obtain scan data. what does the values under /scan represent? is it the range from the obstacles(metres or centimetres).?

A:

That particular node is actually pretty well documented. From wiki/depthimage_to_laserscan - Node - depthimage_to_laserscan - Published topics:

2.1.2 Published Topics

scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan)

        The output laser scan. Follows REP 117, and will output range arrays that contain NaNs and +-Infs.

If you follow the link to the sensor_msgs/LaserScan documentation, it should be pretty clear.
