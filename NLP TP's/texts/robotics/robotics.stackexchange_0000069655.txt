Q:

CMake compiles executable before generating message libraries

Hello,
I face the problem that I get an compiling error while compiling something that is for example using a custom service. The error is that it can't find the headerfile or library that should be generated during catkin_make. If I compile it with one core (catkin_make -j1) it works fine. If it is compiled once the error does not occur again cause the library exists - till the next clean
I guess I defined something wrong in the CMakeList or is it a general problem?
Thanks in advance
Chris

A:

Please see the catkin documentation for instructions: http://docs.ros.org/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/cpp_msg_dependencies.html
You are missing a dependency between your executable target and the message generation step.

Thank you, I haven't had the dependency in one of my libraries, this line solved my problem:

add_dependencies(your_library
${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})
