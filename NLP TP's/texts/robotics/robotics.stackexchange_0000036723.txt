Q:

How to autonomous localization on TurtleBot?

Hi all,
I am very new on ROS and TurtleBot. I have done the tutorial on the TurtleBot where located on this link http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot . The thing is I would like to make a TurtleBot to autonomous localization which means the user have not to localize it by themselves. Moreover, I want TurtleBot can walk thought in a known map, and localize it.
I am working on this tutorial as well which is related to AMCL. http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation , but I don't know it will reach to my propose or not?
So, could you please suggest me what is the first thing I should do?
Best,
Mintra.

A:

You're on the right track. Tutorial #3 from the navigation page is your best bet.

@Mintra You'll know if you try the tutorial that dragging is just giving the starting & destination position and orientation. amcl_demo.launch contains both localizing and auto-navigation (as it's clear from its name = AMCL).

Thanks a lot Ryan. One thing I found on that page is I have to localize it by drag in the direction where TurtleBot is pointing, right? So, if I want TurtleBot to drive automatically and localize by itself llike this vdo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvLX6xmoAw , you have any idea how to do this?
