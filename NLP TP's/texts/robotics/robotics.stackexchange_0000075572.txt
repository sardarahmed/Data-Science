Q:

What global planners come with a ROS Indigo installation?

I am looking into writing simple global planners for a turtlebot 2.
I have looked up other questions and seen that switching out global planners is as easy as changing the value of a parameter in the move_base.launch.xml file.
What I would like to know before carrying on is what global planners already exist on the system? (Base Turtlebot Indigo ROS)
I'd like to know, so that I can examine how these other planner shave been written before going on to trying my hand at writing one.

A:

You can check using this command rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core
That will list all the plugins that use nav_core as the base. Some are local planners, and some are global.
I'm pretty sure the global planners that come with indigo are global_planner, navfn and carrot_planner. You can check all their details out on their wiki pages:

Thank you! I didn't realise rospack could be used to check plugins as well as package info
