Q:

Kinect on OSX Lion 10.7

Hi,
What is the best way to get Kinect working on OSX Lion with ROS Diamondback? I am holding off on Electric until it is ready for OSX.
I tried compiling the unstable openni driver from OpenNI.org, but none of the sample programs worked. Has anyone else gotten Kinect to work?
Thanks.

I still can't make this work ... even using the precompiled drivers from PCL, the programs don't work. The best option is to use libfreenect (http://openkinect.org -- they even have a homebrew formula). There are already a couple packages for it and it really isn't hard to write something yourself.

A:

I already answered my question in the comment ... use libfreenect.
Update: 5 May 2012
I have updated the old libfreenect kinect package and it appears to be working. I am trying to get pcl_ros to work now on OSX.
