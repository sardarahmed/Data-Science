Q:

automatic sorting with barcode identification inside a refrigerator

I'm endeavoring to prototype a challenging sorting mechanism inside a fridge and would appreciate any constructive tips on how to get from the specs to a plausible design.
Problem
The aim of the game is to identify and sort food items in the limited space of a fridge
-   such that a user would push their unsorted shopping into a chamber at the top of the enclosure
-   and the machine inside would then try to identify the contents with help of bar-codes (first big problem)
-   and then sort and move the items according to their identities into different chambers below (second big problem). 
Solution?
Are there any existing devices that already serve such functions (automatic bar-coding and sorting), the designs of which could perhaps inform the mechanics of the device I'm planning to construct?

I'm thinking maybe manufacturing plants
or packing factories with conveyor belts etc may use systems that already solve such problems? 
Or filtering mechanisms in candy dispensers,
mechanized lifting forks? 
Textbook engineering mechanisms?

A:

Moving it around requires, apart the mechanics, always a free and therefore unused space. Wouldn't you rather like to know, what is in which position? And for the barcode: it can become unreadable by ice. I'm thinking of using RFID for a similar project for about 10 fridges with each 30 boxes in it.
