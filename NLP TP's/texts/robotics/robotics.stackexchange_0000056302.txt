A:

Depending on the version of python-rosinstall you have installed, this might be related to rosinstall/issues/89.
Some of the classes / scripts rosws uses were moved to another module, but not all the references to those classes were updated. Version 0.7.2 should fix that.

Make sure you have the latest debian packages and are not using older ones installed via PIP.
