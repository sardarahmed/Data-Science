Q:

roscd to sandbox does not work

Perhaps a stupid question. But roscd sandbox does not work "roscd: No such package/stack 'sandbox'". While it is in the package path and rosws lists it as well..

A:

The directory sandbox is not a ROS package or stack, i.e. it neither contains a stack.xml nor a manifest.xml. roscd only knows about directories that contain these files.
Note that you cannot nest stacks in stacks or packages in packages.

That seems logical. Then there is a however a mistake on the following tutorial page, where they use roscd to get to the sandbox. http://www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Parse%20a%20urdf%20file

True. Unfortunately, the tutorials are not always correct. But feel free to fix it.
