Not that I know of, besides retraining pocketsphinx. I know next to nothing about its innards, but I can imagine that for a different accent, be it Indian, Dutch or whatever, you need a different language model, with different HMM-probabilities or something like that. This is just a guess though

A:

In my experience, PocketSphinx works best on an american accent. This makes sense as it was probably trained on such voices.
