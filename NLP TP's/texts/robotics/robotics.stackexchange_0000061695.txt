Q:

Relation between Services and Nodes

Hello,
I have a very simple question. What's the relation between services and nodes? Can we say services are functions/methods defined in a node. For example, according to this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams
when I'm running the turtlesim_node node, here is the list of active services:
/clear 
/kill 
/reset 
/rosout/get_loggers 
/rosout/set_logger_level 
/spawn 
/teleop_turtle/get_loggers 
/teleop_turtle/set_logger_level 
/turtle1/set_pen 
/turtle1/teleport_absolute 
/turtle1/teleport_relative 
/turtlesim/get_loggers 
/turtlesim/set_logger_level
The question is where are all these services defined? Where can I find their codes?
Thanks

A:

Yes, services are functions in a node that can be called remotely.
Therefore they are defined in the source code of the respective node.
You can find out which node is running a service by using rosservice info SERVICE_NAME
