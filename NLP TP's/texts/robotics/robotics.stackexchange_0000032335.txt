Q:

What does "message of over a gigabyte was predicted in tcpros" mean?

While streaming with theora image_transport, I receive the following error:
a message of over a gigabyte was predicted in tcpros. that seems highly unlikely, so I'll assume protocol synchronization is lost.
What might cause this error?

In my case, I think it's the compiler's bug or some bug in roscpp.
I created a very simple program, and the problem still exists. https://github.com/AutoxingTech/simple_publisher_crash

A:

As the error message indicates, it means that the connection some how became out-of-sync.  This could potentially happen if streaming between multiple computers and somehow the libraries are not the same, or something even more esoteric.

I have the same error. In my case, it happens when a node call a service and the server dies.
