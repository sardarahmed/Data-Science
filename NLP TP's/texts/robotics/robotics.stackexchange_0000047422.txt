Q:

rosmake tf2 osx fails

When I try to rosmake -a in osx Mountain Lion, it fails in tf2 package. I am following the installation tutorial ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source, with the exception that I am compiling rviz direclty from git devel version. I get the following output.

mkdir -p bin cd build && cmake -Wdev
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/Users/mllofriu/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/ros/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake
