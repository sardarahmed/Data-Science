Q:

X11 Forwarding and ROS Visualization Tools

Hi all,
I have a setup where I would prefer to be able to run my ROS setup remotely. When using X11 forwarding, on Rviz or the Turtlebot Gazebo simulator I get the following.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Ogre::RenderingAPIException'
  what():  OGRE EXCEPTION(3:RenderingAPIException): Couldn`t open X display localhost:10.0 in GLXGLSupport::getGLDisplay at /tmp/buildd/ros-electric-visualization-common-1.6.2/debian/ros-electric-visualization-common/opt/ros/electric/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-3/RenderSystems/GL/src/GLX/OgreGLXGLSupport.cpp (line 788)
[gazebo-1] process has died [pid 5289, exit code -6].

Can anyone explain what this error means, and suggest where I could start looking to fix it?
Thanks.

A:

Ogre and OpenGL in general doesn't play well with X forwarding. ROS is inherently network-aware, so you should instead set ROS_MASTER_URI appropriately on your workstation and run rviz locally.

That is really too bad. I am looking for a solution where rendering is done remotely.

wviz: http://ros.org/wiki/wviz might provide the solution you're looking for.
