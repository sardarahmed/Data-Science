Q:

Display x, y and z axis names next to each axis in rviz

Is there a way to display the names of the axis (of the TFs) next to each axis in rviz?
For example, if I remember correctly, the red axis should represent the x-axis, while the green axis should represent the y-axis. The problem is that I'm never sure about these conventions and having to look them up every time is a little bit tedious.

A:

That's currently not possible. It also took me a while but once I realized that XYZ maps to RGB, it got pretty natural rather quickly.
