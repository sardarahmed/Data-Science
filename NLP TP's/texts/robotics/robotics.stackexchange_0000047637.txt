Q:

Is simple action client deprecated?

On Groovy (Ubuntu Precise) I get a depreciated warning when I compile my code with the simple_action_client.h included. I get this message:
/opt/ros/groovy/include/actionlib/client/simple_action_client.h:51:0: warning: "DEPRECATED" redefined [enabled by default]
/opt/ros/groovy/include/octomap/octomap_deprecated.h:7:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition

In that file I find:
#if defined(__GNUC__)
#define DEPRECATED __attribute__((deprecated))
#else
#define DEPRECATED
#endif

Why is simple_action_client.h depreciated? And should I switch to just action_client.h?
Thanks!

A:

First, SimpleActionClient is NOT deprecated.
What you are seeing is a warning about re-defining the macro used to annotate a given function or class is deprecated. It looks like octomap is also defining a macro to use to deprecate code, and they are both called DEPRECATED.
Second, you can see here that the version in octomap checks if DEPRECATED is already defined. The version in simple_action_client.h should also define it in this way.

thanks. i tried to submit a bug report or patch myself just now, but had issues with the old Trac system. i can't wait for everyone to be on github. i emailed one of the maintainers, maybe they can fix this.
