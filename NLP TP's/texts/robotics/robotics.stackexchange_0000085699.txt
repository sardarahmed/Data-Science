Q:

How to change angle_min- angle_max and time_increment on laserscan message

Hi,
I use urg-04lx ug01 hokuyo lidar and its range 240 degree. but in LaserScan.msg shows like below:
angle_min: -2.35619449615
angle_max:2.09234976768
angle_increement: 0.00613592332229
time_increement: 9.76562732831e-05
is these parameters are normal?  -2.35619449615 radyan is  about -135 degree
2.09234976768 radyan  is about 120 degree     is there no mistake??
And how do I change these values? For example Ä± want to angle_min =0 angle_max=240

You have some tutorials available to dynamically reconfigure the parameters.
