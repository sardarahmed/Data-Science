Q:

rostango multiple dex files

Following the rostango wiki, continuing to run into problems, seems like a different error pops up with each reboot.  Right now the initial and the rostango files successfully build with catkin_make and the rostango project opens ok in android-studio 0.6.1.  However, when I try to run one of the samples, e.g. vio, I get this error:
com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Lorg/apache/commons/codec/Decoder;
Searching suggests that this indicates redundant jar files.  But which ones?
Here is the terminal output:
.......
:tango_vio:processDebugResources UP-TO-DATE
:tango_vio:generateDebugSources UP-TO-DATE
:tango_vio:compileDebugJava
:tango_vio:preDexDebug
:tango_vio:dexDebug

What went wrong:

A:

I removed all my JDK versions and replaced them with a single one (Oracle JDK 7), made sure all the paths and variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME in .bashrc, javaHome in android-studio) pointed to the JDK and this went away.
