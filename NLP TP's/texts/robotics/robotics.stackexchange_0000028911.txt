Q:

Problem with get.gazebosim.org

When I use the following command:
curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh
I get the following error:
sh: 2: Syntax error: newline unexpected
Is this a server issue, or is there a different way I should go about getting this package?
UPDATE: It works now, must have been a server issue

A:

The http://get.gazebosim.org endpoint was broken for a while, sorry about that. It should be working again now.
