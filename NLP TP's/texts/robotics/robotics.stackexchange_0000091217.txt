Q:

Will ROS 2 Dashing support RTI Connext 6.0.0?

Trying to install RTI Connext from the RTI website, the version available for download is the new 6.0.0. But I am unable to build ROS 2 master with that version.
The new version seems to have multiple fixes including in the security plugins (part that I'm interested in).
Will ROS 2 Dashing target Connext 6.0.0, or will it target version Connext 5.3.1 ?

We are still waiting for RTI to provide us with an updated Debian package. Once that is available we will be looking into supporting it.

Sounds good thanks!
Should I close this or keep it opened and you'll post an answer once the definitive answer is known?

Keeping it open until the answer is yes or no sounds like a good idea.

A:

ROS 2 Dashing has been officially released and is targeting RTI Connext 5.3.1
