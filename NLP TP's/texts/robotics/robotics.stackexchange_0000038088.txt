A:

There is a good overview of the Applications Platform here: Applications Platform Overview
You can check out the documentation here as well: Applications Platform Links
If you're developing on Linux there's a good description of how to set up your environment here: Clients/Android
And there's a step-by-step tutorial for how to write the simple Pr2 Props App here: How to Write Pr2 Props
If you just want to publish messages to a topic on your computer then a good app to use as a template would be the Teleop app. It publishes messages directly to topics. If you've set up your environment as described on the wiki then you can roscd to android_teleop to take a look at that code.
If you have any trouble finding anything or if there's anything missing from the documentation, please let me know.
Thanks!
