Q:

catkin_create_rosjava_pkg

Dear all,
I have installed ros-hydro and rosjava, but when I try to create a rosjava package I get.
$ catckin_create_rosjava_pkg rosjava_foo
[error] [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosjava_build_tools/templates/rosjava_package/CMakeLists.txt.in' : <type 'exceptions.IOError'>
I don't understand what is the problem.
Please give me a feedbak,
Roberta

A:

Seems like a bug:

Until it's fixed, maybe catkin_create_android_pkg can help you a bit, though you will have to manually change some lines of the result.
