Q:

Low-level differences between jointTrajectoryController and jointGroupPositionController

Hi everyone,
I'm having problem when running servoing of a robotic manipulator. I can't find adequate explanation which could
explain my difficulties. When running robotic arm with MoveIt!, e.g. when I use jointTrajectoryController, arm executes motion
perfectly (schunk lwa4p), which could imply that position commands sent to each joint arrive correctly. However,
when I use jointGroupPositionController (which works in Gazebo), real arm moves only some joints and not all of them.
I'm wondering how could I discover/figure out low-level differences between jointTrajectoryController and jointGroupPositionController?
Thank you for your time,
Have a nice weekend.

This question has very informative answers: https://answers.ros.org/question/356349/difference-between-arm_controller-and-joint_group_position_controller/.
Also, you can try using JointPositionController for each joint to verify that the joints are moving as expected.
