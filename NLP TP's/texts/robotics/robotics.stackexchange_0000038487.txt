Q:

CMake Error in Netbeans (double-check your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH)

I've installed Netbeans 7.1.1 as sudoer in Ubuntu 11.10. Just as it is described in the Wiki at http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs#Installing_NetBeans.
However, everytime I try to build my own package which is a identical copy of the tutorial from http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29, I get the output:
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
[rosbuild] Building package hha
CMake Error at /opt/ros/electric/ros/core/rosbuild/private.cmake:110 (message):
  [rosbuild] rospack found package "hha" at "", but the current directory is
  "/home/<***>/workspace/ros/hha".  You should double-check your
  ROS_PACKAGE_PATH to ensure that packages are found in the correct
  precedence order.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/electric/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:180 (_rosbuild_check_package_location)
  CMakeLists.txt:12 (rosbuild_init)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [all] Fehler 1

BUILD FAILED (exit value 2, total time: 157ms)

What is going on? If I execute 'make' in a terminal, everything works fine! :-/
Also, I get the following correctly identified path of 'rospack find hha'
/home/<***>/workspace/ros/hha

A:

The problem is due to the changes made to Netbeans configuration files' location from 6.x to 7.x. Please add source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash to netbeans.conf based on the information given here:
http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqNetbeansConf
