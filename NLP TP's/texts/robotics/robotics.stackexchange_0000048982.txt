Q:

static transform publisher - launch file

Hi.
I have different frames which I create with the static transform publisher in a launch file, for example:
I work with a kinect and get from the kinect_aux node the actuel angle from the tilted position from the kinect back. (cur_tilt_angle)
So my question is, is it possible that instead I write a fixed value like 1.57, I get this cur_tilt_angle in the launch file?
Thank you for help.
(I use ROS electric.)

A:

You will need to write a node that listens to that particular topic and publishes your required tf. With a static transform publisher only fixed transforms can be published.
If it is not a topic but a parameter stored in the parameter server, then yes, you can use that parameter and load it to the static transform publisher. Take a look here.

@Miquel Massot  @JaRu can you please refer to me an example code where "write a node that listens to that particular topic and publishes your required tf" is implemented.

@Gudjohnson I would take a look at the "Writing a tf broadcaster (C++)" tutorial example, here: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20broadcaster%20(C%2B%2B)
