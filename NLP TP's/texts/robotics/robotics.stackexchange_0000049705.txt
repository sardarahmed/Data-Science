A:

You better use overlays instead of trying to change installed packages in place.
EDIT: (presuming you are on clean ROS installation)
After making overlay workspace with sandbox directory (as described above) do:
$ roscd && cd sandbox

Now you should be in ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox or wherever you have made overlay.
Next, download exploration stack sources:
$ svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/bosch-ros-pkg/code/trunk/stacks/exploration

Update rosstack and rospack cache:
$ rosstack profile && rospack profile

Make sure that overlaying stack is visible to ROS:
$ roscd explore

This command should bring you to ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/exploration.
Now you can edit the sources.
To compile the whole stack:
$ rosmake exploration

And finally to run explore node:
$ rosrun explore explore

In general, it is not a good idea to run node executable directly. So always use rosrun.

Comment by Boris on 2013-03-25:
Did you add overlay after clean installation of ROS? If not, reinstall ROS and try again.
