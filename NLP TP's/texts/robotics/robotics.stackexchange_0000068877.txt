Q:

Failed to process package 'compressed_depth_image_transport'

Hi I'm trying to install ROS Indigo on OS X Yosemite, and executing
$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

I have come across the following error. How can I resolve it?
==> Processing catkin package: 'compressed_depth_image_transport'
==> Building with env: '/Users/Zoe/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh'
Makefile exists, skipping explicit cmake invocation...
==> make cmake_check_build_system in '/Users/Zoe/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/compressed_depth_image_transport'
==> make -j4 -l4 in '/Users/Zoe/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/compressed_depth_image_transport'

clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

<== Failed to process package 'compressed_depth_image_transport': 
  Command '['/Users/Zoe/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh', 'make', '-j4', '-l4']' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /Users/Zoe/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/compressed_depth_image_transport && /Users/Zoe/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4

I'm currently having the same issue on El Capitan.

A:

Looks like you're missing tbb, did you run rosdep to make sure you have all of your dependencies? The step is in the tutorial here:

Yep I have tbb installed.
When I ran brew install tbb, the output is Warning: tbb-4.3-20150611 already installed

Well, then I'm not sure. Sorry I can't help more, maybe someone else will be able to help you. I'm using the same OS and versions but I'm unable to reproduce this error.

Since tbb is installed, is the environment set up correctly to find it?
