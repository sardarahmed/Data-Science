Q:

What is the difference between geometry and tf quaternions?

I am trying to create a geometry_msgs::Quaternion from two other (to create an Odometry message).
I've found that tf::Quaternion is a btQuaternion but it is not a geometry_msgs one.
I would like to know which is the difference and how can I work if I only have geometry_msgs::Quaternion inputs and outputs. Thanks!

A:

They represent the same data.  There are different libraries which support native processing of each of them.
There are conversion methods such as to and from message datatypes for your convenience.

What's the method for the geometry classes in tf2? I found my way to tf2::convert, but that doesn't seem to do quite the right thing.
