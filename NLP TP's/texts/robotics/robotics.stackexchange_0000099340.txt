Q:

MoveIt create PlanningSceneInterface

I am trying to retrieve a collision object that is present in the moveit planning scene to then attach it to a robot link. To do this, I thought of getting the object by its ID using the getObjects method of the PlanningSceneInterface class. However, when I try to create an object of the PlanningSceneInterface class I get the following error:
error: ‘moveit::planning_interface’ has not been declared
 moveit::planning_interface::PlanningSceneInterface scene_interface;

I am including the class with the following line:
#include <moveit/planning_interface/planning_interface.h>

I am running ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04, with gcc 7.5.0.
Thanks in advance!

A:

The header is actually: moveit/planning_scene_interface/planning_scene_interface.h. It is part of the planning_scene_interface package, which is in the planning_interface folder of moveit_ros. That is probably where the namespace comes from.
See the header at the Github repository.
