Q:

Missing link to the package test_matlab

Hi,
I am trying to connect my ROS package to a MATLAB code. I am trying to test the package test_matlab_basic_ros. When I do a rosmake. I get the following error.
  /home/suraj/ROS_Packages/test_matlab_basic_ros/src/test_ros.cpp:44:33: fatal error: test_matlab/Vector3.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.
  make[3]: *** [CMakeFiles/test_ros.dir/src/test_ros.o] Error 1
  make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/suraj/ROS_Packages/test_matlab_basic_ros/build'
  make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/test_ros.dir/all] Error 2
  make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/suraj/ROS_Packages/test_matlab_basic_ros/build'
  make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
  make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/suraj/ROS_Packages/test_matlab_basic_ros/build'

I am aware that I do not have the package test_matlab on my PC. But I was not able to checkout that from the link. The link does not exist.
https://usc-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/usc-ros-pkg/trunk/sandbox/matlab/test_matlab
Please let me know if there is alternative link. Or I have to make changes in the code.
Thanks for the help.

A:

I guess you are using old and deprecated code that is not supported anymore. I'm not sure how the current state of matlab integration of ros is, but google was showing me this link. Maybe that's an alternative for you?
