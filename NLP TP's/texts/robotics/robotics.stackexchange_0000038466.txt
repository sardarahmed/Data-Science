Q:

Is it possible to set a custom template roscreate-pkg?

I'd like to customize the behavior of roscreate-pkg so that it follows company defaults, urls, etc and I'm wondering if there's a "right" way to do this.
I suppose the obvious answer is that I could just store a template somewhere and use that instead of roscreate-pkg, but I'm hoping to avoid deviating from the standard workflow and code paths as much as possible.
Are the defaults for roscreate-pkg parameterized somewhere such that they can be easily customized?

A:

No, they are not parameterized anywhere.  roscreate-pkg is a fairly simple tool right now.
