A:

I don't think the command you tried is currently possible -- I don't find a package called USARSim available in the list of the packages that are built on ROS build server in Indigo.
There are several questions on this forum about using USARSim with ROS. And this package by @makokal seems a good option since some people were able to get them working together.

Thank you very much for answering my question but here is one more questions: Which package should i use to connect to USARSim through ROS-Indigo.
in the list of the packages that are built on ROS build server in ROS Indigo i didn't find any package which can act as ROS-USARSim interface.
