Q:

svn check out problem

Dear Sir,
I use Ubuntu 16.04 and I want to check out the stack containing swissranger_camera using svn, but after running this code "svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/camera_drivers_experimental", I got this error:
"svn: E170013: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/camera_drivers_experimental'
svn: E000111: Error running context: Connection refused"
I appreciate you to help me to solve the problem.
Thanks,
Abbas

A:

code.ros.org has been taken offline a long time ago. You'll need to look somewhere else for this code.

Do you know the address of a website that corrects the codes which contains code.ros.org?
Thanks
