Q:

rqt_bag: cannot import name qInfo

Hi,
Today rqt_bag doesn't want to work. Giving me this error:
$ rqt_bag
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/bin/rqt_bag", line 5, in <module>
    from rqt_bag.bag import Bag
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_bag/bag.py", line 39, in <module>
    from .bag_widget import BagWidget
  File "/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_bag/bag_widget.py", line 40, in <module>
    from python_qt_binding.QtCore import Qt, qInfo, qWarning, Signal
ImportError: cannot import name qInfo

I am running ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ros just got updated today morning with apt upgrade.
Any idea how can I solve it?

A:

Please read the comments for more information about the resolution of this bug

Temporary fix
Edit the file:
sudo nano /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_bag/bag_widget.py

Modify the line producing the error from:
from python_qt_binding.QtCore import Qt, qInfo, qWarning, Signal

To
from python_qt_binding.QtCore import Qt, qWarning, Signal

Then comment every call to qInfo in the code, you can find them with:
grep -rn "qInfo" /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_bag/

Use nano or any other editor to comment the calls inside this python code.
You can then use rqt_bag again!

Works as a charm. Tks!

Note that as @VictorLamoine already writes: this is really a temporary fix. As soon as you receive an updated .deb (through apt-get update fi) the changes will be overwritten.

Bug where this is tracked: ros-visualization/rqt_bag#15.
And PR that (presumably) fixes it: ros-visualization/rqt_bag#16.

And a PR that fixes the previous PR: ros-visualization/rqt_bag#17.
To quote @Dirk Thomas:

rqt_bag version 0.4.11 will fix the problem. I have just released that version so it might be a bit until it is available from Debian packages.

For me, the temporary fix allows rqt_bag to start; however, attempting to load a bag file results in the same qInfo error.  (Ubuntu 16.04, Kinetic)
Comment by VictorLamoine on 2017-11-13:
@Marvin make sure you have done the last steps (grep + edit the file)
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-11-13:
Another option is to enable the Shadow Repository and install rqt and related pkgs from there. Don't forget to switch back to the default repository after doing that.

I tried @VictorLamoine temporary fix and it worked for me, thanks
