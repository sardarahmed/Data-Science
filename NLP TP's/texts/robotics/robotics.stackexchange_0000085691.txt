Q:

Mouse position to map coordinates in Rviz?

Hi,
I'm trying to find a way of clicking on the map in Rviz and obtaining the coordinates of the map itself at that point. Is there a way of going about this?

This is a duplicate of #q69019. See that question for a few options which may be used to get this sort of info. They're all not really meant for it, but it works well enough for some use-cases.
