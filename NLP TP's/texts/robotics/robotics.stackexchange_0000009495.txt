Q:

What iRobot products support the open interface besides the iRobot Create?

I have read that certain iRobot products support or can be hacked to support something close to the open interace. There is even a book about hacking Roomba. What Robots have this capability?

A:

Any iRobot product with a 7-pin mini-DIN connector has some subset of the Open Interface. Roomba 500 through 800 series robots without Wi-Fi should correspond to the set in the Create 2 manual while the 400 or Discovery series correspond to the original iRobot Create. However, based on the date of manufacture, it may be necessary to apply a software update to the robot in order to enable this functionality. Robots with Wi-Fi have a mode state machine that differs from the one in the Open Interface specification, but most of the commands are the same.
