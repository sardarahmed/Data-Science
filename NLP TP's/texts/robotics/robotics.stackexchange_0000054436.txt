Q:

Old versions of packages in ROS repository

The latest version of the ros-hydro-gazebo-plugins package (2.3.2-0precise-20130920-2002-+0000) is broken (this bug) and I want to downgrade it to the previous version. The ROS repository however seems to have only the latest version of the package. Where can I get older versions?

A:

You should be able to find the complete revision history on github, where you linked to.
If you are looking for older versions via apt, I think you're out of luck. There are no different versioned apt repositories.
The only thing you might be able to try, if this is newly introduced, is switch to a ROS mirror in the hope that this one hasn't updated yet.

Ok, thank you. I guess I will just compile from source in github.
