Q:

How does ROS Topic data transfer work with large data streams?

I am studying ROS and I have the following question. When a node wants to transfer a relatively big data stream, for example, an image, how many TCP/IP connections are created to do such a transfer. One for the whole image or one per data packet?
Thank you in advance

A:

Each topic connection will usually have a single connection which will carry many images.
