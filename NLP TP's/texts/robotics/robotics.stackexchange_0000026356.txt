I assume you're talking about Atlas in drcsim. l_clav and r_clav are links, that are connected by joints named [lr]_arm_usy and [lr]_arm_shx. Which joint are your curious about?

A:

Use the GUI to turn on joint visualization (View -> Joints). The axis of rotation for a joint is highlight with a circle.
