A:

What packages do you need to get the source code of? Usually their at http://wiki.ros.org/%PKG_NAME% (replace %PKG_NAME% with the actual name) contains links to their development repository. If there aren't then maybe google search the package name.
code.ros.org has been terminated years ago.

UPDATE: If you had web searched, it should have been easy to find a github repo for 3d_navigation... I've updated the wiki page with the latest repo location.
