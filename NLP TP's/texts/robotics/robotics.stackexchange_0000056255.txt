Q:

Where can I contact ROS developers for a collaboration project?

Hello
I want to integrate an Adroid app to a platform based on ROS.  I use freelancer and have not found anyone with the skillset.  Is there anyone here who could point me in the right direction to locate a pool of people (or person) who can offer consultancy and development services for ROS on a time and materials basis?
Many thanks in advance, Dataman.
