Q:

rosjava on Android device with local network address

I'm trying to use rosjava on Android devices with 3G network connection.
But some devices obtain local IP addresses.
I think we have to use VPN or SSH tunneling for communicating other nodes.

http://answers.ros.org/question/2124/ssh-tunnels-and-ros

But I think these ways are not good to force users to do.
Is there any other solution?

A:

Most mobile service providers (at least here in germany) are using network adress translation for the mobile clients. Since ROS needs bidirectional direct connectivity between alle nodes, i would guess that there is indeed no other option than using some sort of tunneling.
Maybe you can find a solution that doesn't need ROS-Nodes directly on the mobile clients, but have a server offering some of the functionality as a webservice, which is then called by the mobile clients.
In fact i would prefer the (web-)service approach, since ROS itself provides no sort of authentication and/or authorization, so any client would be able to publish and subscribe to any topic they want...

Thanks for your answer. Making a web service is a better approach, but developing web application with high transparency to ROS network is difficult for me. No authentication may become a problem in the future indeed. Tunneling seems to be a only way to use android.rosjava applications.
