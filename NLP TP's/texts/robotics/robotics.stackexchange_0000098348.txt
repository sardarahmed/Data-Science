Q:

ament_export_targets vs ament_export_interfaces

In reference to this on ROS Discourse: https://discourse.ros.org/t/ament-best-practice-for-sharing-libraries/3602
What is the difference practically between these two lines and when should I use one over the other?
ament_export_targets(export_${PROJECT_NAME} HAS_LIBRARY_TARGET)

and this one (as shown in the example at that link):
ament_export_interfaces(export_${PROJECT_NAME})

A:

Replying to my own question.  I found in the official documentation (here: https://index.ros.org//doc/ros2/Tutorials/Ament-CMake-Documentation/#building-a-library) this:

The ament_export_targets macro (ament_export_interfaces in Eloquent and older) exports the targets for CMake.

This seems to imply that ament_export_targets is a rename of ament_export_interfaces and should now be used instead.
