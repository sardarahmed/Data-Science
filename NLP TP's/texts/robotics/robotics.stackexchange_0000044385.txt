Q:

AMCL does not subscribe

I'm trying to get robot pose estimation using gmapping in conjunction with amcl. Gmapping correctly builds the map using laser scans and I have tf, laser and map topic that publish messages. When I run amcl it does not publish the pose estimation and when I type rostopic info amcl_pose the node has no subscriber. How can I make the amcl node working?
Thanks

A:

You either use gmapping or amcl. Both do particle-filtering based localization. While gmapping also builds a map, amcl requires an already built map on the map server. You cannot use amcl and gmapping at the same time.
After you built a map using gmapping and saved it to a file, you need to stop gmapping, start the map server to provide your map and run amcl.
