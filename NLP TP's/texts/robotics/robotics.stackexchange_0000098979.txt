Q:

Getting coordinates of robot positions from move_base

Hi, I'm playing around move_base , trying to find a way to get the coordinations of my robot each time it moves on the map ( x,y, rotation ).
Any idea how to get theses from the move_base?

A:

move_base uses a global costmap and a local costmap.
You can get the pose of the bot in the global_frame of the costmap using the costmap_2d::Costmap2DROS::getRobotPose() function.

thanks for the answer, but i need the return as a value not boolean.

Let's assume that move_base uses  costmap_2d::Costmap2DROS* global_costmap.
Then, we can use the following -
tf::Stamped< tf::Pose > global_pose;

bool flag = global_costmap->getRobotPose(global_pose);

Does that make sense?
