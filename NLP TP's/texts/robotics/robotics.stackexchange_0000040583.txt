Q:

"No devices connected..." error with Turtlebot

I am getting a no devices connected error when attempting to launch the kinect. I have turtlebot dashboard up and running in full mode with 0 breaker green. My Kinect is plugged in as well and it looks like the other components are coming on except for the camera. I have also tried "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch".
turtlebot@turtlebot:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch

Please post the solution as an "answer" and then accept it once you are able to (in perhaps a week or so I believe it might let you). This will let others easily see that the question has a solution and find the correct solution. Thanks for helping to keep ROS Answers organized and easy to use!

Eric - Thanks for notifying me! I am still getting used to the forum.
