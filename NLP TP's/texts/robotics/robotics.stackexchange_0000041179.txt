Q:

How do estimate AR drone height

I have a AR drone parrot and I use the drone package from Brown university, so is it possible to estimate altitude for drone using the available IMU data in navdata messages...

A:

The /ardrone/navdata message should contains a field for estimated height called altd (see here), which I believe is from the ultrasound sensor on the drone.
In general it is difficult to estimate position from an IMU, as you need to dead reckon over the acceleration values to estimate height, and this process accumulates error.

How would you suscribe to this topic in order to work with the values of altd?
