Q:

[build] Error: Unable to find source space `/home/usr/Desktop/src`

I am trying to build a workspace that is stored in: /home/usr/Desktop/ROS/workspace/, the workspace directory is clean and does not contain any hidden files hence .catkin_tools is not present. It only contains one directory src. I have tried catkin init with empty src directory and by putting a package in src. Here is the output:
Catkin workspace `/home/usr/Desktop` is already initialized. No action taken.

What I don't understand is why is catkin looking for workspace in /home/usr/Desktop and not the current directory? The same package is easily built with catkin_make though and I am able to run all the nodes. Also If I put src in /home/usr/Desktop I am able to build successfully.
I am using ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04. I am not sure about the catkin tools version but i installed it from here: https://jbohren-ct.readthedocs.io/en/pre-0.4.0-docs/installing.html

Please try to always use the main documentation when using any tools. In this case that would be here:
https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

The fact that the link you posted (eventually) leads to an account called: jbohren-forks seems to suggest it is not the main version of the documentation.

A:

the workspace directory is clean and does not contain any hidden files hence .catkin_tools is not present.

No, but:

Workspace:                   /home/usr/Desktop

it's likely there is a .catkin_tools directory in /home/usr/Desktop.
What is the output of ls -al $HOME/Desktop/.catkin_tools?
The rest of the warnings/errors you are getting follow from this. If $HOME/Desktop is the workspace according to catkin_tools, there is no src space (as that would be in $HOME/Desktop/workspace/src).

Edit:

I didn't knew i had it on my desktop, but why should that matter? I can have multiple workspaces, what if desktop is a workspace, I cannot have any other workspace inside it?

Having multiple workspaces is completely supported. But you just can't nest workspaces (ie: workspaces inside other workspaces).
If you want to have multiple workspaces, make them siblings or place them in entirely different directories.
It might also be informative to take a look at wiki/catkin/workspaces. Specifically: workspace overlaying.

Thanks for the answer. It worked, I didn't knew i had it on my desktop, but why should that matter? I can have multiple workspaces, what if desktop is a workspace, I cannot have any other workspace inside it?

Hello so i am a beginner and have a similar issue, how exactly did u work around it?
catkin build returns an error saying source at home/thimaya/src doesnt exist
while im in ~/ws_moveit/ .
My home directory contains catkin_ws  , ws_moveit  and .catkin_tools .
I probbed into profiles in .catkin_tools and it said  source : src
is it not possible to make a the folder in the home directory cuz of catkin_ws ? I tried making one in another partition of mine but i had the same error.
Thanks in advance !

@thimaya It has been a long time since I asked that question. From what I remember, I had made my desktop into a workspace and then deleted all files except the hidden .catkin_tools. When I tried to build my workspace nested inside Desktop it gave error.
You should not make your Home into a workspace. What you should do. Press Ctrl+H delete .catkin_tools. Also delete other files and folders created by ROS.
Now make one folder say catkin_ws then follow tutorials to build this workspace and create packages. Also, whenever you run build or make, make sure you are in catkin_ws folder.
