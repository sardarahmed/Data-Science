Q:

displaying camera on rviz

hi all,
i'm trying to display a camera on rviz, the source is a camera on Gazebo.
rviz shows me that:

CameraInfo                 -> No CameraInfo received on [/finger_tip_cam/camera_info].  Topic may not exist.

image                      -> No image received.

Transform [sender/=Gazebo] -> No CameraInfo received on [/finger_tip_cam/camera_info].  Topic may not exist.

What could the problem be?

Try running "rostopic list", and adding an (edited) list of the relevant topics to your question.

are you sure data is being published on those topics? how did you add the camera in gazebo? please provide something for us to work with

A:

Instead of adding a camera in rviz, try adding an image. If the publisher of this topic only updates the image and not all the information required for a ROS camera interface, rviz can not display the image.

What other information is required for a ROS camera interface?
