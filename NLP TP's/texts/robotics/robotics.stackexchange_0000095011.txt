Q:

After few hours of running the moveit program, the program is killed

Hello, I am trying to implement Reinforcement Learning within ROS for a KUKA manipulator. Therefore, I need to let run program for a day in order to learn the KUKA manipulator accomplish certain task. However, after few hours the program is killed with this error messages:
ERROR: Failed to fetch current robot state
INFO: Didn't received robot state (joint angles) with recent timestep within 1 second. Check clock synchronization if you are running ROS across multiple machines!
To provide more info: I am using Gazebo simulator with a small cube and the task is to push the object into the goal location. Regarding to Moveit, I am using TrackIK solver and I generate [x,y,z] coordinates from the neural network directly to trajectory_controller using setFromIK function.
I am using:

ros::AsyncSpinner spinner(2);
spinner.start();

so this should not be a problem. I have already tried increase number of threads but its not working. Could someone point me to the right direction? This is the problem why the learning process is failing.

A:

I solved it by using tf2 instead of tf library.
