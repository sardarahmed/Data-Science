A:

It seems like you are mixing kinetic and melodic sources.
The method
virtual void initialize(std::string name, tf2_ros::Buffer* tf, costmap_2d::Costmap2DROS* costmap_ros) = 0;

from nav_core (see here) is pure virtual and not implemented in teb_local_planner according to your build log.
The method indicates the tf2 dependency which was introduced to ROS navigation and teb_local_planner in melodic.
So it seems that you are trying to compile the kinetic version of teb_local_planner with the melodic version of the navigation stack.
Make sure to clone the correct branch, e.g. for melodic:
git clone -b melodic-devel https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git
git clone -b melodic-devel https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/teb_local_planner.git

Or use the correct ROS distribution for your APT repositories.
