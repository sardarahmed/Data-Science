Q:

ROS Installation on Red Hat7

Hello,
I'm trying to install ROS (Indigo) on Red Hat7 according to the this tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source).
When I try to install all the required dependencies using the following commands:
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

I get the following errors:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:

rqt_robot_steering: No definition of [python-rospkg] for OS [rhel]
catkin: No definition of [python-nose] for OS [rhel]
class_loader: No definition of [libpoco-dev] for OS [rhel]
urdf: No definition of [liburdfdom-headers-dev] for OS [rhel]
...

Is there any way to install all the required dependencies on Red Hat? Thank you!

Edit:
Hello,  thank you for this quick reply. I tried the following command instead
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo --os=fedora:2

Then, I received:
#All required rosdeps installed successfully

But, I got the following error messages when I go through the next step, step 2.1.3 to build the catkin workspace.
CMake Error at /u/leejang/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/cmake_modules/cmake/Modules/FindPoco.cmake:186 (MESSAGE): Poco was not found.  Set the Poco_INCLUDE_DIR cmake cache entry to the top-level directory containing the poco include directories.  E.g /usr/local/include/ or c:\poco\include\poco-1.3.2

Call Stack (most recent call first): CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package) -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! <== Failed to process package 'class_loader':

I think that it still has dependency problems.. Thank you.

Updated!
Yes, there was no error when I type the command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo --os=fedora:21

The failed package is 'class_loader':
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Thank you very much for your help!

Edit:
Now, I'm facing the following error message:

I tried to search solution here, but I couldn't find..

Edit:
Thank you gvdhoorn for your kindly reply.  Now, I've completed install with ROS-common packages (NO GUI tools). I think that it's enough for my current project. So, I close this question.
Thank you again I really appreciate your helps!

Can you check that the Poco library and headers are actually installed? What is the output of find /usr -name Poco.h?

Thank you! It wasn't there, so I installed it and the problem was solved. Now, I'm facing other problem about Eigen3, but it seems that it also wasn't my system.

Please see whether Compiling on centos7 helps.

[..]

Seems like some package depends on the Poco library, but either didn't declare it, or Poco is a transitive dependency of something on Fedora, but not on RHEL7. Can you please update your question with a bit more context? What package failed to configure?
As to a solution / work-around: you could try to see whether you can install poco-devel manually (at least, that's what I assume it is called on RHEL). A quick search did not turn up any RHEL7 package for that though. Are you sure there were no errors when you ran the rosdep install .. --os=fedora:2 command?
Also: remember: doing an install this way is really nothing more than a work-around. The proper way would be to contribute rosdep rules for RedHat.

Edit2:

  skipping gtest 'test_urdf' in project 'pr2_description'

and:

Cannot specify link libraries for target "test_urdf" which is not built by this project.

It would seem you don't have gtest installed, which causes this line to probably fail. The next line tries to then link the test_urdf target with some other library, but since the test_urdf target doesn't exist, it fails the entire build.
Please make sure you have gtest installed. If you can't install it, you might be able to skip all testing by appending -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=False to your catkin_make invocation. The pr2_description package will still fail though, as it hasn't been properly setup (see pr2_common/issues/241 and pr2_common/pull/238).
