Sorry for the spaces in the links, not enough karma.
I was able to install Indigo Desktop-full from source on Ubuntu 12.04. I basically followed the instructions posted at http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source, but needed to do a few extra steps.
First, install the prerequisites from the installation instructions. I already had ROS Hydro installed on my machine, and was able to install the dependencies from apt. Once the dependencies are installed the following should work.
Install lz4
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa: gezakovacs/lz4
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install liblz4-dev

Install OpenCV.
I initially tried using the opencv from the ubuntu repositories without success. Building and installing the latest version of OpenCV from source worked successfully. http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.zip/download
$ unzip opencv-2.4.9.zip 
$ cd opencv-2.4.9/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig

Perform the first steps of the installation process
$ mkdir ~/ros_catkin_ws
$ cd ~/ros_catkin_ws
$ rosinstall_generator desktop_full --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only --tar > indigo-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall
$ wstool init -j8 src indigo-desktop-full-wet.rosinstall 
$ rosdep update
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

This last command will give you errors. This is because the dependencies really are not defined. However, most of these should be opencv related due to the fact rosdep does not know we installed it from source.
Install console_bridge
$ cd src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ros/console_bridge.git
$ cd console_bridge/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake .. 
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd ../../..

Install urdfdom_headers
$ cd src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ros/urdfdom_headers.git
$ cd urdfdom_headers/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ sudo make install
$ cd ../../..

Install urdfdom
$ cd src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ros/urdfdom.git
$ cd urdfdom
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ sudo make install
$ cd ../../..

Finally, start the build. Make sure you have not sourced any ROS setup.bash files.
$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

You can resume building at the package you failed at using the following command.
$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --from-pkg=<package name>

Using console_bridge from the source repository as-is will give you a very different version then what is used in Indigo on Trusty from Ubuntu.
