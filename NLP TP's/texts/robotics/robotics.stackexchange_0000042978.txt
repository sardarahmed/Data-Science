Q:

camera_based localization

Hi all
I'm on this localization project and I'm required to do localization using a kinect camera. I did some research and all the resources I found are using laser scan instead of a camera, like the ACML package. So I'm wondering if anyone knows a good resource on camera_based localization. Lots of thanks !!!

thanks yay that's what I tried using but it's much nosier than laser scanner so in the end I just used laser scanner. Thanks anyway!
