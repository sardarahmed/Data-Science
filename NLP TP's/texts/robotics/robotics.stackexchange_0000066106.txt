Q:

ROS Matlab Compressed Image?

Node =
rosmatlab.node('Test','http://localhost:11311');
subscriber =
Node.addSubscriber('/sonar_image/compressed',
'sensor_msgs/CompressedImage', 10);
subscriber.addCustomMessageListener({@test_fun,
Node.Node});

Good day, I have code as such. It doesn't seem to get anything though. My function does callback test_fun, however, the message returned doesn't seem to have anything
