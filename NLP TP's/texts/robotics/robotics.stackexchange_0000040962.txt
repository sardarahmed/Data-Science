Q:

kinect failed openni_launch

Hello everyone,
I'm using ubuntu 11.04 and ros electric.
I'm trying to use my kinect to "play" with rviz with it, but when I run "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch", I have a lot of errors:

I have run rostopic and I can see some /camera/depth or camera/rgb topics so I tried to see something in running rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image but the window is empty.
I have run rviz and added a "image" and chosen the topic /camera/rgb/image_color but it says me "No image received".
I may do something wrong, I have started to read ros tuto 2 weeks ago.
Hope I'm saying anything crazy.
Cheers
Brioche

I had the same errors yesterday and now I fixed. I'm not a master, and I use fuerte and ubuntu 12.04 so I don't know  if it works also for you, but I noticed that for me works only kinect for xbox, kinect for pc tell me no devices connected.

then in my case I also see, don't know why, that works just once, then I have same errors more or less, and i have to restart ubuntu and works again.. try this, if not, somebody more expert than me maybe can help..
Comment by Brioche on 2012-06-03:
I have just upgraded my ubuntu and now it works fine ( rviz is lagging but it works!!)

A:

Hi,
Try openni_camera
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

It works for me.
Thanks,
Karthik
