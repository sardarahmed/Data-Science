Q:

rqt_graph not showing all active nodes

I've been following through the simple examples for actions and I'm not sure how to change the setting to get rqt_graph to show nodes a level "deeper".
The action is questions is an exact copy of the ones used in: link
The action node graph they get is: 
The graph I get instead is: 
and calling rostopic list -v returns:
morten@mortenThinkPad:~$ rostopic list
/fibonacci/cancel /fibonacci/feedback /fibonacci/goal /fibonacci/result /fibonacci/status /rosout /rosout_agg
I'm relatively new to ROS so I'm not quite sure what other information could be relevant. I'm running ubuntu 16.04LTS with ROS kinetic.
edit: adding picture now that I have enough karma

I would like to upload a picutre but I don't have enough karma.

Please attach the image directly to the question.

Thanks for the reminder, I've just done so.

A:

What you are seeing is the ROS nodes. They are shown in bubbles whereas the ROS topics are shown in rectangles. If you want to see both you need to select the drop-down menu from the top-left corner and change it from "Nodes only" to "Nodes/Topics (all)"

After selecting the "nodes/topics (all)" topic the graph doesn't change. Do I need to reload the image.
Comment by M@t on 2019-06-11:
Possibly yes - click the circular blue arrow in the top-left corner to reload the graph. If that doesn't work, add  a screen shot to your question (as gvdhoorn suggested) and add the output of rostopic list.
Comment by morten_nissov on 2019-06-11:
The formatting got a little weird but I've added the output from rostopic list as well.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-11:
@morten_nissov: you have "group namespaces" and "group actions" enabled. That is why your graph looks different from the one shown in the tutorial.
Comment by morten_nissov on 2019-06-11:
Ah okay, I'll try again without then.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-06-11:
You'll also want to uncheck all the options in the Hide section.
