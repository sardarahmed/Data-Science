Could you please be a litte more specific? What kind of dependencies? You are talking about rosdep, so I assume you mean system packages and nor ros packages? Which packages exactly? Are you using Ubuntu? Which version? Also, is it really an error message or just a warning?

A:

Short answer is in this Tutorial.
I recommend working through at least the Beginner Tutorials before trying to use ROS.

It sounds like your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is not set correctly.   I suggest that you review the other Tutorials linked by @joq
