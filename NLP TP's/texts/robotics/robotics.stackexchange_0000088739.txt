Q:

I have problem regarding the KUKA_experimental installation

Hello everyone,
I tried to install KUKA manipulators within ROS-Industrial. I followed the following procedure :

mkdir -p ~/moveit_ws_2/src  -->   cd /path/to/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/kuka_experimental.git  -->  cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src
catkin_make

PS I also did source the work space by :   echo 'source ~/ws_moveit/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
However by putting this command roslaunch kuka_experimental kuka_rsi_simulator.launch I dumped to the following error:
[kuka_rsi_simulator.launch] is neither a launch file in package [kuka_experimental] nor is [kuka_experimental] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Could anyone please kindly help me ?

It looks like there are multiple mistakes in the commands you listed. In (1) did you really run cd /path/to/catkin_ws/src or did you cd to ~/moveit_ws_2/src? Are you sourcing the setup.bash for ~/ws_moveit or ~/moveit_ws_2? What are your ROS environment variables (env |grep ROS)?

Most often the error that you are describing comes from people improperly sourcing the correct setup.bash file

Sorry for the typo. I did work in ~/moveit_ws/src. I followed the exact same way I have been asked on wiki.ros.org  in the same order. I did source it right I am think as roscd works fine.

A:

I also did source the work space by : echo 'source ~/ws_moveit/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc

That doesn't source the workspace.
Or at least: it will source the workspace only after you start a new bash shell, or after you source $HOME/.bashrc.
Also: the workspace you created was named moveit_ws_2, not ws_moveit.

However by putting this command roslaunch kuka_experimental kuka_rsi_simulator.launch I dumped to the following error:

[kuka_rsi_simulator.launch] is neither a launch file in package [kuka_experimental] nor is [kuka_experimental] a launch file name

And this makes sense, as kuka_experimental is a metapackage, it doesn't contain any launch files.
If you want to start the kuka_rsi_simulator.launch launch file, the command would be:
roslaunch kuka_rsi_simulator kuka_rsi_simulator.launch
