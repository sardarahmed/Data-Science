Q:

DRCSIM: drcsim-nightly can't roslaunch either

After

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install drcsim-nightly

roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch

dies with the messages

Msg Waiting for master

Interestingly,

gazebo

works, as does our code that does not use ROS:

gazebo world

A:

I'm unable to reproduce this problem.  Is it still happening?  If not, it was likely a temporary instability in the nightly packages.
