Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: roslaunch rqt

Hello,
Is it possible to perform a .launch with rqt?
I can use my puglin with rqt and I use two terminals, one for call rqt and the other to call a .launch. I want to include rqt in my .launch, is it possible?
<launch>

    <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="player" output="screen" args="--clock /home/user/bags/bag.bag"/>
    <node pkg="a_package" type="a_node" name="a_node"/>

</launch>

I tried this one but it is wrong:
<launch>

    <node pkg="rqt" type="rqt" name="rqt"/>

</launch>

Is this a copy and paste error or does is your opening launch tag really a closing one? I.e., change the first </launch> to <launch>.

Yes, it was a copy and paste error.

A:

Yes you can do that, you have to call the node rqt_gui from the package rqt_gui like that :
<node name="rqt_gui" pkg="rqt_gui" type="rqt_gui"/>
