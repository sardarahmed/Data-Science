Q:

tum_simulator on ROS Hydro

hi,
i'm trying to install tum_simulator on hydro.
wiki.ros.org/tum_simulator
However, cvg_sim_gazebo_plugins package depends on 'gazebo' package in ros. Ros hydro comes with a pre-installed gazebo but its package name is 'gazebo_ros' so tum_simulator cannot find 'gazebo' package because of its new name. How can i make tum_simulator to see 'gazebo_ros' package as 'gazebo' package?

no, i couldn't use that package with ROS Hydro. i'm using hector_quadrotor instead.

A:

Since its Hydro release, ROS does not have Gazebo inbuilt anymore. Gazebo is now a separate standalone platform for simulations, which can be integrated and used with ROS hydro using the package gazebo_ros_pkgs. For more information you should visit gazebosim.org.
