Q:

How to create/display a static voxel_grid map?

I've searched quite a bit, and to no avail, for a modern, minimal example of creating a static voxel map and displaying that map in rviz. Most tutorials have incomplete steps, or aim at map creation within the whole navigation environment. Without sensors or navigation infrastructure, I wish to load a pre-existing global voxel map and display that in rviz. Is 3D map creation and publication possible without providing sensor sources? I was able to do this through map_server in 2D by providing a BMP file.
This video is a nice example of what I'd like to display, but they're clearly using sensor input.

What tutorials are you referring to?

A:

You could do this using octomap, it's designed to update the map with point clouds from sensors but you could add a single point cloud containing your map at the start then keep this initial map for the duration of your experiment.
What format have you got the 3D map in that you want to display in rviz?
