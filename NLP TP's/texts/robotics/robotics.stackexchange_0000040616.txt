Q:

rosmake fails to find rosbuild.cmake on fuerte

after following the install instructions for Ubuntu 12.04 & ROS fuerte here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu
I'm unable to build any rosbuild-based packages.  I receive the following error during "rosmake":
  mkdir -p bin
  cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (include):
    include could not find load file:
  
      /opt/ros/fuerte/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake
  
  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (rosbuild_init):
    Unknown CMake command "rosbuild_init".

rospack find rosbuild returns:
/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild

so it looks like the /share/ros is missing from all my cmake files. A bug? or am I supposed to do something special with my old CMakeLists.txt files?
I've observed this behavior under both Ubuntu 12.04 (from official debs) and Mac OSX (from source)

A:

Maybe something is wrong with your environment configuration. What's the value of ROS_ROOT and how do you set it? For fuerte it should be /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros.

Ah ha! You nailed it. It was originally set by the setup.bash/sh scripts created by a rosws unit call added to my bashrc file. However I changed those scripts manually (even though I shouldnt)
