Did you start your pycharm from a terminal?

A:

you didn't install python3 in fully.
Does your code has this line on the top? Like this line:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
You aren't using any conda or ancoda, right?

I think i install python3 in fully,but maybe not use conda.I set up a pythonpath and  i added the path of 'rclpy' file.it workd, but why?

So, that was the path issue then! I'm glad things fixed on your end! Could you mark your answer as "green check"? So others can get some idea to update their work.
