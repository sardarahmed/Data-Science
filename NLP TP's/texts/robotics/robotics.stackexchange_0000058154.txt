Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS on fedora

Hello,
I was wondering since there is no "official" way to installing hydro on fedora, would it be possible to install it from source ?

A:

Yes, there seem to be a few people using it on Fedora. I would go with the generic from-source install instructions. rosdep does support Fedora to install system dependencies: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source
People are working on a binary installer for Fedora, so it might soon be even easier than that: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/bloom/pull/228
