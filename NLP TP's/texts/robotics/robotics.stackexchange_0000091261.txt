Q:

Use wstool but keep git directories organized under a custom structure

Imagine I have the following structure in my directory:
ros_ws
|__src
       |.rosinstall
       |__robots
                |__baxter
                     |__baxter.rosinstall
                     |__baxter_sdk
                     |__.git
                      ...
                |__sawyer
                     |__sawyer.rosinstall
                     |__sawyer_sdk
                     |__.git

Is there a way to call wstool update locally or globally to update git repos but keep them in my pre-established structure. Currently when I do wstool update it want to place updated git repo folders directly under ros_ws/src.

A:

I'm not sure I understand you correctly, but the .rosinstall format supports specifying a destination for clones/checkouts of repositories with the local-name property.
The documentation on the file format describes it as:

Inside every top level dictionary there is one required key, local-name this represents the path where to install files. It will support both workspace relative paths as well as absolute paths.

So if you want to keep things in a different directory than directly in your source space, you could do that by setting local-name to something like:
some_dir/other_dir/baxter/..

Each entry has its own local-name key, so each repository can be placed in a different directory.
