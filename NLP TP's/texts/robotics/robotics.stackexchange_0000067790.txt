Q:

error when I included PCL passthrough filter

Hi there,
I am using iai_kinect to use Kinect 2.0 under Ubuntu OS. I wanted to use the passthrough filter for point cloud. And always show the error of segmentation fault (core dumped).
And then I found out that even I just added #include <pcl/filters/passthrough.h> in the beginning, the program doesn't work anymore. The error message shows The program has unexpectedly finished. When I deleted this line, it just works.
I have no idea, why it doesn't work by just including a header file in the cpp. Does anyone have an idea.
Best regards
ZYJ

We need more information! What functions are you trying to implement? What is your application?
Generally speaking, I use nodelets wherever I can to implement PCL filters.

A:

I solved the problem by myself later on. The reason is that PCL does not support c++11 orginally. In my code, some c++11 functionalities are used. So I build the code from the their github repositary, and add SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11") to the CMakeList.txt. Then make and make install the PCL libaray. Then it will solve the problem.

How can it be PCL does not support C++11? C++11 is 100% compatible with previous C++ standards, so everything compiling under C++0x should compile under C++11. Am I wrong?
