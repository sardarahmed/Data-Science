Q:

time.sleep() in a node

I have a node where I need to wait for a specific amount of time. Can I just use time.sleep() in python or do I need something else?
Thanks,

A:

You should definitely NOT use time.sleep()
The ROS way of doing this is:
rate = rospy.Rate(1) # 1 Hz
# Do stuff, maybe in a while loop
rate.sleep() # Sleeps for 1/rate sec

Or the similar:
rospy.sleep(1) # Sleeps for 1 sec

In both cases, you'll ofc need to import rospy
Here's the API documentation: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/rospy/html/rospy.rostime-module.html

I only want to delay once, not repeatedly. How would I implement that?
Comment by spmaniato on 2016-04-30:
It's the second code snippet above: rospy.sleep(1) # Sleeps for 1 sec  Adapt it to how many seconds you want to delay.

What is the benefit of using rospy.sleep instead of time.sleep?  Is it just that it is interruptible?

+1 on @Rufus question comment. It's a very strong NOT, without any explanation.
