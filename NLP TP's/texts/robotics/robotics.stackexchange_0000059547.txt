Q:

err when using gscam

Hi Guys
I tried to run gscam to get image from my camera but when I typed
$ roslaunch gscam v4l.launch 

I got these errs:
[FATAL] [1400738699.774908523]: Failed to PAUSE stream, check your gstreamer configuration.
[FATAL] [1400738699.775082184]: Failed to initialize gscam stream!

and when I typed :
$rosrun gscam gscam

I got these errs:
[FATAL] [1400738785.074504579]: Problem getting GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable and 'gscam_config' rosparam is not set. This is needed to set up a gstreamer pipeline.
[FATAL] [1400738785.074717553]: Failed to configure gscam!

How can I fix these?
any suggestion about this?
thanks
hamid

A:

Section 2 on the gscam wiki page describes how to the set the GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable; that should fix the second error you encountered.
You'll also want to make sure that you're using the correct video device, something like /dev/video0 or /dev/video1, and that your user has read and write permissions on it.
I'm not sure why their v4l launch file doesn't work; it isn't documented on the wiki.
