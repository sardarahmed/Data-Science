Q:

Updating Costmap2D with a static map

Hello everyone,
I'm working on exploration of unknown maps with mobile robots. I would like to know if there is a way to update a costmap from a static map (e.g. the one created by gmapping) in place of using the observation_sources parameter, while also keeping the track_unknown_space parameter to true.
I need this because otherwise sometimes my exploration costmap gets noisy. As an alternative can the clear_costmap_recovery be used for a custom costmap in order to reinitialize the map from a static map?
Thank you in advance!

A:

Well observation_source could be used to use for example scan data to create a map. This might be used for the local costmap. As you use the static parameter, the costmap depends on NO other data then a published map(from gmapping for example).
So if you want to create a global_costmap set the static parameter to true. By increasing the update and publish frequency you can keep the costmap up to date more accurately.
The tracking of unknown_space is independent to an observation_source or whether you use static or a rolling_window approach.
Hope this helps.
