Q:

EffortJointInterface causes gazebo to segfault

I'm trying to use <hardwareInterface>hardware_interface/EffortJointInterface</hardwareInterface> in my  URDF but Gazebo crashes after starting the controllers. I thought i was doing something wrong, so i tried the RRBot demo and had the same issue: https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_demos

OS: Ubuntu 16.04
ROS Distro: Kinetic
ROS Version: 1.12.14
Gazebo Version: 7.14 (tried on 7.0 as well, same issue)

Error (with debug and verbose turned on):
Thread 37 "gzserver" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread 0x7fff4effd700 (LWP 12785)]
0x00007fff11c7773d in gazebo_ros_control::DefaultRobotHWSim::readSim(ros::Time, ros::Duration) () from /home/bob/workspace/devel/lib//libdefault_robot_hw_sim.so
(gdb) 

Is this a bug? I've noticed other people submitting issues on the repo with the same problem.
Thanks.

It's a long shot, but do you have any outstanding updates to ROS packages? If so, please make sure to update all packages.
Also: are you running this in a Docker container?

A:

@gvdhoorn, based on your suggestion, i removed my workspace, recreated it, reinstalled all the packages/libraries, and it's now working. Must have been a corrupt library or something. All good now. Thanks!
