Q:

Gazebo Illegal instruction

Hello
I'm new to ROS and I installed Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) 64bit. The normal examples work well, but gazebo crashes with an illegal instruction error. I get the error with an AMD Phenom II CPU and with an Intel Core 2 CPU as well.
Do you have any ideas?
Thanks
Matthias

been struggling with this for 3-4 days now
Comment by hsu on 2012-06-06:
are you running 1.6.10?  (check /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/CMakeLists.txt).
Comment by Kai Bublitz on 2012-09-04:
for me the same problem appeared after the last gazebo update.(package version 1.6.14-s1346200794~precise). Gazebo worked (kind of) in the previous version. I guess there's nothing I can do except waiting for the next update and hoping it works again in the next version.

A:

Update
Thanks again konradb3, [simulator_gazebo 1.6.15](http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/ChangeList/1.6) with SSE4 disabled on the way.  Please check [fuerte debbuild](http://www.ros.org/debbuild/fuerte.html) for updates.

[A regression in system path loading](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/15/systempaths-getogrepaths-systempaths) might be a possibility, but that should be fixed in 1.6.14.

Running them separately (rosrun gazebo gui) crashes for me as well (Gazebo 1.6.14 from deb) Dmesg has errors relating to libQtGui.so in the gzclient
Comment by Ugo on 2012-09-03:
Since upgrading to 1.6.14 gazebo crashes for me as well (http://pastebin.com/pGihq74c)
Comment by konradb3 on 2012-09-03:
The reason of crash (at least for me) is that gazebo is compiled using SSE4.1 instructions which are not supported on my cpu.
Comment by Erwan R. on 2013-05-14:
I got a similar issue when spawning PR2 in Gazebo (1.6.16) that wasn't present one week ago. I didn't use ROS last week but I did two updates yesterday and monday 6th that may be related. Is this SSE issue fixed ? I'm using fuerte on ubuntu 10.04.
