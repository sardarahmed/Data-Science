Did you create workspace before creating package ?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2014-11-13:
The error message indicates that you have multiple packages with the same name in your source space. Can you please post the recursive content under your workspace folder: /home/chhonkar/Desktop/imagews/src
Comment by ASHISH CHHONKAR on 2014-11-13:
@bvbdort yes i created the workspace of name imagews......

A:

The problem is that you have two copies of the package ardrone_autonomy in your system. Remove one of them.
If you don't need that package you can do:
sudo apt-get remove ros-indigo-ardrone-autonomy

Then try to run catkin_make again.

You will probably need to rebuild the workspace in /home/chhonkar/Desktop/imagews
