Q:

Kinect dynamic reconfigure does not work

Hi, I'm trying to follow the tutorial openni_launch for calibrating the Kinect, but when I launch the dynamic_reconfigure node and check the depth registration box it stops to publish images. When I uncheck the depth registration box it starts to publish again. Any idea to fix this? Are there some problem with the kinect driver?
Thanks

Same problem here. Is this a common bug because I see several people experiencing the same problem

Are there any update for the node available in the ros community to fix this problem?

Sweet! I finally got it working

A:

I don't know why but when I installed openni_launch stack from ubuntu repos using the command below,
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-openni-launch ros-fuerte-openni-camera

the result is the same. Hovewer, when I tried to download the stacks from the kforge, it works. (This might be a bug in the ros-fuerte-openni-launch package, I am not sure.)
I recommend you to remove packages ros-fuerte-openni-camera and ros-fuerte-openni-launch using
sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-openni-launch ros-fuerte-openni-camera

and download them back using
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_launch
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/openni_camera

These stacks are working for me.
