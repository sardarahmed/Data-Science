Q:

PCL dependencies on ROS electric

I was following a tutorial  on PCL. It seems that I have a lot of functionalities that cannot be used. There are also some warnings on the header files. The header files that got warning are:

pcl/point_types.h
pcl/filters/passthrough.h
sensor_msgs/PointCloud2.h
pcl/ros/conversions.h
pcl/point_cloud.h

Do I need to explicitly add/install extra packages like pcl_filter? I have also been trying to install in on my "ROS electric" but it seems that it is not compatible with it. The pcl_filter that I used is from this.

A:

The standalone PCL library is not compatible with ROS electric. This problem will be resolved in some future release.
To run PCL with ROS, install the perception_pcl stack, and perhaps perception_pcl_addons.

It seems to work but I did not manage to install perception_pcl_addons, but I guess that one is optional.
