Q:

ROS/Hydro installation error: library '-framework Cocoa' is neither a target nor built/installed properly

Hi,
I tried to install ROS/Hydro in OS X10.9 with homebrew following with ï¼šhttp://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
When I run $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y, I got
 CMake Error at /Users/Baifan/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/pcl_ros/cmake/pcl_rosConfig.cmake:141 (message):
  Project 'depth_image_proc' tried to find library '-framework Cocoa'.  The
  library is neither a target nor built/installed properly.  Did you compile
  project 'pcl_ros'? Did you find_package() it before the subdirectory
  containing its code is included?
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /Users/Baifan/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package)
CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package)

I installed pcl-ros. But I got error

 CMake Error at /usr/local/share/pcl-1.8/PCLConfig.cmake:47 (message):
  simulation is required but glew was not found, then in **CMakeCache.txt** of **pcl_ros**, I replaced the line ` GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND` to
GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/glew/1.11.0/include/GL and replaced the line GLEW_GLEW_LIBRARY:STRING=-framework GLEW  to
GLEW_GLEW_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/local/Cellar/glew/1.11.0/lib/libGLEW.dylib.
It seems pcl-ros installed successfully.
2)I found there is find_package(PCL) in CMakeLists.txt of depth_image_proc.
So I don't know how to fix '-framework Cocoa' library problem. Can you help me?

A:

I fixed the problem by replacing the line
GLEW_COCOA_LIBRARY:STRING=-framework Cocoa   to
GLEW_COCOA_LIBRARY:FILEPATH= /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Cocoa.framework  in CMakeCache.txt of pcl_ros.
