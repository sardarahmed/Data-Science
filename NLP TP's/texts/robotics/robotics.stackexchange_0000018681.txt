Q:

Electronic Speed Controller

What should be the specification of ESC that I should use for a 320KV 1820W brushless DC Motor?. Is it necessary to use an 80A ESC?, Basically, How can I choose the required ESC for a motor?

A:

It depends on the voltage. 
Say you are running 12V:
1820W / 12V = 151A

With a 24V system:
1820W / 24 = 75A
