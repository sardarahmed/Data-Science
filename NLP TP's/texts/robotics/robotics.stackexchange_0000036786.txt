Q:

How to create a Service with ROSJava

When you install latest release of ROSJava you have an example named: rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.
This example is really useful to understand how to publish topcs and how to subscribe, but in the release, I didn't have any example to create a service with rosjava.
Anybody can help me?

A:

Services are also created from nodes just as publishers and subscribers are. Have a look at the javadoc for Node.newServiceClient and Node.newServiceServer.
