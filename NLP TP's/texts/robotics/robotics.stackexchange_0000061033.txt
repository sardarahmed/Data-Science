Q:

robot web tools -> set fixed frame for camera

Hi all,
is it possible to rviz-like specify the fixed-frame for the camera in ros3d.js?

A:

You should have a global TFClient object that most ros3djs objects take in as a parameter. This object can be initialized with an alternative fixed frame, e.g., http://wiki.ros.org/ros3djs/Tutorials/VisualizingInteractiveMarkers#CA-3c28fc37578db0ccb1aa845adfa83e6d333d7fb3_35

That should do the trick thanks!! Only thing that stays on the fixed frame (not depending which) is the ROS3d.Grid but it can be connected to a frame via ROS3d.SceneNode and then also behaves properly....
