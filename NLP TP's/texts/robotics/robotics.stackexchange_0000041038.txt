Q:

openni_params missing

I'm in the process of upgrading a Turtlebot from Ubuntu 11.04/Electric to 12.04/Fuerte.  The first thing to do is to recalibrate, but when I run turtlebot_calibration I'm getting the following:
error loading <rosparam> tag: 
    file does not exist [/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/info/openni_params.yaml]
XML is <rosparam command="load" file="$(find openni_camera)/info/openni_params.yaml"/>

Indeed it does appear that the openni_params file is missing.  What happened to this?

A:

I just experienced the same problem migrating my robot setup to Fuerte. It looks like the old openni_camera package got split up and deprecated. There is a migration guide, and you should be able to modify the turtlebot_calibration source accordingly until an official Fuerte version is released.

I did not well understand the migration guide. should I obtain the deprecated version first and change my dependency names or depend upon the new openni package? I have the same problem as asked above.

I would recommend depending on the new openni package. It also seems a turtlebot stack has been released for Fuerte. You might want to try it out.
