Q:

Can't find the custom message....ImportError: No module named wam_node.msg

I have wasted my whole day figuring this thing out. I can rosrun both packages, but python just cant find that "wam_node" package. I have used c++ before to use the same message and it worked. I don't know what is wrong ?
Am I missing something ?
Any help/suggestion is appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
Error when I run the package (rosrun hand_control grasp_with_biotac.py):
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/rohit/catkin_ws/src/BMI-robot-arm-control/hand_control/src/grasp_with_biotac.py", line 12, in <module>
    from wam_node.msg import HandPosVel
ImportError: No module named wam_node.msg

Python code for import:
from std_msgs.msg import String
from biotac_sensors.msg import BioTacHand
from wam_node.msg import HandPosVel

"rosmsg list | grep Hand"output:
biotac_sensors/BioTacHand
wam_node/HandPos
wam_node/HandPosVel

manifest.xml of hand_control package :
<package>
  <description brief="hand_control">

     hand_control

A:

It looks like you're mixing catkin and rosbuild packages somehow. This is generally not a good idea.
Your hand_control package is in a catkin workspace, but it has an old-style rosbuild manifest.
Is the wam_node package a catkin package or a rosbuild package?
If wam_node is a rosbuild pacakge, you can't depend on it or use it from a catkin package.
If your hand_control package and wam_node are both rosbuild packages, you'll need the old import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('package') line at the beginning of your python node in order to set up your python path correctly.

Yeah, I do have packages all mixed up, so that can be a problem. But anyways, now I have built a new catkin package and replicated the messages from wam_node for this package and it works fine.
