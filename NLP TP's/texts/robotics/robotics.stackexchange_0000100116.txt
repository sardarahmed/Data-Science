Q:

MULTI-SESSION RTABMAP PROBLEM

Hello everyone, i am working with rtabmap, and I want to use multi-session feature of this package to merge local maps. I am following this tutorial multi-session tutorial. However, i figured out that besides .db files of maps, i need the multi-session1Hz.ini file as well (like in the tutorial).
The tutorial doesn't show how to generate the multi-session1Hz.ini file clearly. Can you tell me how to do that please?

Thanks in advance!

A:

With recent rtabmap versions, parameters are saved in the database, so you don't need the ini file. Anyway, the ini can be exported with Window->Preferences->Save settings (*.ini).
At the top of the page:

Update: While this tutorial should still work, it is slightly outdated as maps created with recent RTAB-Map versions don't require an INI file to be merged (parameters are saved in database for convenience). Follow this multi-session tutorial with RTAB-Map Tango instead.
