Q:

How to add a dynamic visual marker in gazebo?

I have a regular robot model in gazebo and i'd like to display some forces applied on a link for visualization and validation purposes. What would be the best way to do this?
I'm looking for something that would allow me to display a vector (coming from a ros topic) without interacting with the rest of the sim. Do I have to use a cylinder object? if so, how do I modify it dynamically?
I run gazebo 1.5 distributed with Ros-groovy in linux 12.04 lts.

A:

Visual markers have been added to gazebo8. Use gz marker -h for help.

Is there are way to update the markers efficiently? I need a marker that visualizes a vector every OnUpdate loop and it seems that node.Request("/marker", markerMsg); is super slow.

@nkoenig Is there a way to make these visual markers appear in camera images?
