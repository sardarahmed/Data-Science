Q:

ros noetic rviz motion planning fps drop, high cpu

I have a ros package called "robot_arm_v4" which works fine without rviz but after starting rviz and adding "MotionPlanning" a cpu issue occurs and fps starts to drop.
If I disable "MotionPlanning", this problem disappears.
this problem does not happen in melodic (xubuntu 18.04) only noetic (xubuntu 20.04).
