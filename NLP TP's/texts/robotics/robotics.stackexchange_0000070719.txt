Q:

dwa_local_planner penalize negative x velocities

Hi all,
I am using dwa_local_planner as my local planner and there is a parameter penalize_negative_x in the yaml file. In my case, it does not seem to have any effect, if I give my min_vel_x: -0.2, it prefers to go in the reverse direction for long duration although penalize_negative_x : true whereas it should just turn in place and go forward. Also, I was not able to find penalize_negative_x parameter anywhere in the source code of dwa_local_planner which makes me think if its really being used or not?
Any help will be appreciated. Let me know if you need more information from me.
Thanks in advance.

Did you find a solution for this? I want to my robot's preferring forward motion too.

A:

penalize_negative_x seems to be obsolete. Check this commit.

Can we edit the dwa_local_planner wiki to reflect these changes? It still says this is an option.
