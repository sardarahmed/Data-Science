Q:

error when installing rocon on turtlebot

Hello,
I'm trying installing turtlebot on my PC. And  actually I follow the tips on roswiki.
Unfortunately ,when I create a workspace for rocon and then I run command
$ wstool init -j5 src https://raw.github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon/indigo/rocon.rosinstall

Then i got an Error which said 404 Error.
Now im wondering if this web doesn't exist any more. If it does, how can I download rocon package. thx

Could I ask you to please spend some time formatting your text properly next time? As it was, it was rather unreadable. Thanks.

And could you please also include links to any tutorials you are following? Without those it's rather difficult to know what you have been trying to do.
Thanks.

above is the link that I followed to try to install turtlebot. The command that goes wrong is in the"0.0.2 Worksapce", thx!

A:

I have the same error as you. The path of rocon-indigo has changed on github. So you can use the following command:

wstool init -j4 src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon/release/indigo/rocon.rosinstall
