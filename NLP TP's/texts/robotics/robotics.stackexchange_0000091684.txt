Q:

Getting descriptive outcomes from ExePathAction

I am trying to design some recovery behaviors for a bot following a set of waypoints, with velocities issued by TEB. I am using ExePathAction to start the navigation with TEB.
I would like to know when the path is blocked (BLOCKED_PATH = 109) in order to trigger either a GetPathAction until the next waypoint, or maybe some other recovery behaviour.
Are the descriptive outcomes + messages already implemented in MBF? Or do these descriptive outcomes have to be implemented in the controller (in this case: TEBLocalPlannerROS)?
Or should it be implemented by extending some function of the controller_action or abstract_controller_execution?
Thank you for your time, any help will be appreciated! :)

A:

Hi, MBF just provides extended interfaces for the plugins, with error code and message. But it's up the the plugins to provide this information. If a plugin doesn't implement the extended MBF, we wrap the old nav_core interface and report SUCCESS / FAILURE depending on there it returns true / false.
For TEB, we have implemented MBF's extended interface in our fork. We report the following possible outcomes:

SUCCESS
NOT_INITIALIZED
INTERNAL_ERROR
INVALID_PATH
NO_VALID_CMD

To my understanding, TEB doesn't recognizes explicitly situations when BLOCKED_PATH outcome makes sense, but feel free to PR it if you have already implemented the code!

We don't have any code for the BLOCKED_PATH event yet, but this helps. Thank you!
