Q:

how to restart dynamixel after overload error?

Hi.
I'm using dynamixel_motor package to control my robot.
Often my dynamixel shows over load error because of tough usage. Once this error happans, I have to switch off my dynamixel and switch on again.
This way is not useful,so I would like to restart that dyanamixel through a program after over load error.
Could you tell me how to do this?

A:

It depends on the model of Dynamixel you are using. Some of the newer models (XM and Pro series) have reboot commands builtin. For the others it is a combination of toggling the torque enable register and setting the torque limit register http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/showthread.php?7289-How-to-clear-Dynamixel-Overload-error&p=66440#post66440.
Buggy behavior has also been noted in some AX-12 firmware releases, so the exact ordering of these steps may be different in some configurations http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/showthread.php?7289-How-to-clear-Dynamixel-Overload-error&p=66441#post66441.
Finally, if overload occurs it's usually a good idea to review your design and determine how it can be avoided. I've burnt up MOSFETs on several AX-12s by ignoring and resetting overload errors. At the very least be sure to let the motor cool down if the temperature is also high.
