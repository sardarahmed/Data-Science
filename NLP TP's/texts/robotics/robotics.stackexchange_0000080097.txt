Q:

Errors on catkin_make

Hello.
i'm trying to built some package in catkin_ws but the catkin_make gives me the following errors:
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'nao_writing_android_nodes'.

Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':classpath'.

A:

Hi there,
did you try to resolve your dependencies? The command
rosdep install --from-paths ~/your-workspace/src --ignore-src

will try to resolve the dependencies of your packages. Then try again with
catkin_make

I hope that it will work for you.

Hello.
thank you for your answer. I get the following error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies: ros_markers: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [OpenCV]
What is the problem now?
thank you

It seems like the package ros_markers does not provide the 'rosdep keys'. So rosdep can't resolve the dependencies for this package. Plz take a look at the rosdep command reference http://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rosdep/html/commands.html. You could try to exclude the package from rosdep.
