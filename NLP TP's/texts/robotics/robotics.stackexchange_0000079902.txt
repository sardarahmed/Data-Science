Q:

change Gazebo initial position of the arm

I don't know how to change the arm(Jaco2) starting position in Gazebo. Currently the only thing that I do is to execute the move_robot.py script (modified with my desired position), but this represent a problem in my case since the arm is integrated on the top of the Husky robot and the initial pre-imposted movement cause an overturning of this latter.

A:

You can set the initial joint positions like in this example: hector_tracker_gazebo_launch/launch/spawn_default.launch
