Q:

Missing resource hokuyo_node

I am trying to use a Hokuyo rangefinder, following the tutorial, but fail at the first step: rosdep install hokuyo_node rviz
It seems that hokuyo_node is not in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:
    ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
 Missing resource hokuyo_node ROS path 
    [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros ROS path 
    [1]=/home/dbarry/fuerte_workspace/sandbox ROS path 
    [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks ROS path 
    [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share ROS path 
    [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros

But hokuyo_node is in what seems an odd spot:
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_plugins/
and adding that path to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH does not help.
I must be missing something obvious, but need help figuring it out.
Using Ubuntu 12.04, ROS fuerte

A:

The hokoyu_node in gazebo_plugins is just an executable.  You are missing the package.  You can install it using

sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-laser-drivers

Or you can install it locally using

rosco hokuyo_node

This requires the rosinstall bundle:

sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
