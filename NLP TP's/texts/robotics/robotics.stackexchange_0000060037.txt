Q:

Problem with ardrone_driver

I'm trying to roslaunch ardrone_driver. I have installed the ardrone_autonomy and tum_ardrone packages. when i try to roslaunch ardrone_driver i get this message:

[ardrone_driver-1] process has died
[pid 19905, exit code -11, cmd
/opt/ros/hydro/ardrone_autonomy/bin/ardrone_driver
__name:=ardrone_driver __log:=/home/michael/.ros/log/1b4dd950-f22c-11e3-a388-d0df9a5bc38d/ardrone_driver-1.log].
log file:
/home/michael/.ros/log/1b4dd950-f22c-11e3-a388-d0df9a5bc38d/ardrone_driver-1*.log
all processes on machine have died,
roslaunch will exit shutting down
processing monitor... ... shutting
down processing monitor complete done

And if i leave it long enough it says:

Timeout when reading navdatas -
resending a navdata request on port
5554

If someone knows any solution to this problem i would appreciate the help.
I'm using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04. The ardrone is an AR Drone 2.0 firmware 2.3.3

A:

Which .launch file from ardone_autonomy did you try to launch?
Just to go over the basic, you start the driver with rosrun ardrone_autonomy ardrone_driver. Make sure your computer is connected to the drone's wi-fi.

open up the launch file you are trying to launch in a text editor. You'll see, that it will launch a couple of other nodes. To further investigate which node excactly is dying, you have to open up a couple of terminals and launch each node one after another. Post your findings in your question

The other option might be to just open up the log file described in your output ;) Usually there is more detailed information there too

The picture looks OK to me. Can you get data from the drone say, with rostopic echo ardrone/navdata? If you connect to the drone from your phone, disconnect your computer.
If you want an example for flying AR.Drone with ROS, there is this tutorial: http://robohub.org/tag/parrot-ar-drone-tutorial/

After you get those lines of [INFO], open another terminal, run: "rostopic list". You should see /ardrone/navdata among the output. If you do, the driver works. If you run "rostopic pub -1 /ardrone/reset std_msgs/Empty" you should see the drone LEDs change to red (green if you do it again).
