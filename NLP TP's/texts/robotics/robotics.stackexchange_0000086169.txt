Q:

Turtlebot_navigation issue:local_map drifts after a long-distance movement

I want to upload some pictures to show my problem, but I don't have enough points. Therefore, I can only explain it with my poor English. Sorry.
I am using a turtlebot2 to do my experiments. It worked well for a long time. But this Monday, after I built a new map or maybe after I decrease the max_vel_x, I found it can not locate itself well any more.
I usually start my turtlebot2 at the same position as the position that I start to gmapping. At first, the local_map can match the static map well. But if I send a goal that is a long-distance away, the local_map would drift. Then the local_map can not match the static map well with not only distance but also orientation. I have tried everthing I can think out to fix it, but none of them worked.
Need help~~
The map is a big rectangle, about 6m*6m.
I can upload now.

It looks like your sensor can't see the walls all the way around. Have you recently increased the size of your map?

No,the map is the same as it was at last week and it worked well. This problem appeared just yesterday.

Can you repost the images as screenshots instead of pictures taken with a phone/camera?

what if you set the goal  near your turtlebot?

A:

I did this and the turtlebot2 behaved better, but still not good enough.
