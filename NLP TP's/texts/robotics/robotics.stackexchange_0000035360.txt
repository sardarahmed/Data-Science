Q:

Openni problem in Debian. Kinect not detected

Hi,
I installed openni to work with a Kinect on a Debian Squeeze. I followed the instructions in http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect to build and install a package for debian, and after that I used the openni.launch to start working with kinect, but I get a message of "No devices detected".
The kinect seems to be detected by the system if I do lsusb (xbox NUI Motor?).
Can anybody help me? Thanks.

A:

Try launching:
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

This works for me in diamondback.
It seems that for electric your are launching the right one tough.
