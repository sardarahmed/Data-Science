In the example the bag file should be in a ros folder. Is it possible to locate the bag file in not ros folder and have the launch file in the same folder and find the bag file ?

Instead of $(find image_view)/test.bag you should be able to put a hard-coded absolute path to your bag file. I haven't tested that.

Is there an option for png images?
