Q:

Error integrating Gazebo 1.9 with Ros Hydro

I am unable to wrap gazebo to interface with the the ROS. Followed the stepwise instruction in the gazebo page, everything goes fine but when I try to run the simulator it says could not connect to the master. when I run the gzserver in another terminal it works despite the error. Isnt gazebo supposed to run with only
$ rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

command?
saroj@saroj:~$ rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

A:

The problem is solved.. had to use $killall gzserver because it was still running the previous instance because of error while closing.
