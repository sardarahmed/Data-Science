Q:

Keep altas robot from falling while turning in place

I've designed a python script that will allow the atlas robot in the drc simulator to walk by keyboard input.
However there is a flaw in turning on a point (input z/c), whenever it finishes it ends up leaning back and collapsing.
Any ideas on how to correct this? My first though is to lean forward, but I have no idea how to do that. The script is attached below to test.
qt1.py

A:

This script creates a set of steps for Atlas to follow. Maybe it can help you.
