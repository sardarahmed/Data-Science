A:

Make sure your ros workspace is correctly defined. You should not install the rgbdslam package in opt/ros folder.
The instructions on the page are very clear. Make sure your ROS environment and workspace is properly set.
See this page on how to set up your ros workspace ROS workspace tutorial

a good idea is if You have created a workspace to add these lines in .basrc file:

source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash

If You have created Your workspace and it worked and after some time reseted a computer then You "lose" path and You need to add it again (or bash it :) )
