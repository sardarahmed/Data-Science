Q:

Is the translational vector (positon) in transformation matrices in cm or another unit (MATLAB)?

My transformation matrix gives me, for example, x = 0.06, y = 0.27 and z = -0.04
It does not make a lot of sense to me if this is in cm.

A:

They are in whatever units the kinematic analysis uses.  It could be feet, inches, meters, millimeters, or whatever.  Your question is a bit like asking “what unit is the Pythagorean theorem written in?”  It just needs to be consistent with the analytic approach.
