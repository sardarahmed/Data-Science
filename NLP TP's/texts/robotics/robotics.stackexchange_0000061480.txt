Q:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException'

Tried the 3D Visualisation tutorial for the turtlebot. I'm having a hard time launching the kinect on my turtlebot laptop. Below are the terminal logs. (note that user@eko-gateway is my turtlebot laptop)
user@eko-gateway:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch

The 3rd step which is the start rviz on my workstation computer(running ROS indigo) also came out nothing after ticking Laserscan and DepthCloud. All I had was the default image of the turtlebot and grids.

A:

It says at the top that you launched this from user@eko-gateway. However,
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch

must be run on the Turtlebot. I know that the turtlebots by default have username "turtlebot", so I'm just curious if this was ran on the turtlebot or your workstation?

Ahh I'm sorry, I've edited my post to mention that the user@eko-gateway is my turtlebot laptop.
Anyways, I've just updated my depthimage_to_laserscan package. I'll post my progress after I try running this tutorial again later.
Thank you for your input btw!
Comment by charkoteow on 2014-08-06:
yes after updating the package, the process no longer being terminated after process[depthimage_to_laserscan-18].
I believe, this is now solved.
Comment by ahubers on 2014-08-06:
Sounds great. Let me know if this gives you any issues with depth registration; my depth_registered stream is all 0's at the moment.
Comment by charkoteow on 2014-08-07:
How do you check that?
Comment by ahubers on 2014-08-07:
turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch seems to run depth_registration by default. Running rostopic echo camera/depth_registered/image_raw should show you the values of the depth_registered image, and whether or not it works.
Comment by charkoteow on 2014-08-13:
sorry for the late reply, indeed my rostopic echo camera/depth_registered/image_raw also came out as nothing.
