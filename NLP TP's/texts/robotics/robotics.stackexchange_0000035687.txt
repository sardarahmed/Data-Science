Q:

ros electric gpsd_client error

Hi community,
currently gpsd_client did not work any more ;-
MockBot$ rosrun gpsd_client gpsd_client _port:=2947

netlib_connectsock() returns socket on fd 9
[ INFO] [1321344855.149877424]: GPSd opened
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::math::rounding_error> >'
  what():  Error in function boost::math::round<d>(d): Value nan can not be represented in the target integer type.
Abgebrochen

gpsd is running:
MockBot$ sudo lsof -i :2947
COMMAND  PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
gpsd    3466 nobody    4u  IPv4  93755      0t0  TCP localhost.localdomain:gpsd (LISTEN)
gpsd    3466 nobody    5u  IPv6  93756      0t0  TCP ros:gpsd (LISTEN)

I've updated ros-electric with apt-get to the last version...
Any idea ?
Cheers
Christian

A:

I got the same error when using an UBOX gps.. the problem was that the gps doesn't publish the time as requested by the gpsd_client.
To solve it you have to pass a parameter to disable the time from gps
here is the command line i use to start gpsd_client
$ rosrun gpsd_client gpsd_client _host:=localhost _port:=2947 _use_gps_time:=false
and it should work
Regards
Mario
