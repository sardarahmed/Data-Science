Q:

using JointState.position in transformations

Hi all,
Can I directly use the joinstate.position[i] for rotation or should there be some processing when rotating successive joints other than the first one?
This is with reference to forward kinematics on ROS indigo.
Thanks.

I'm not sure I completely understand what you are asking. Can you clarify what you mean with "some processing when rotating successive joints other than the first one"?

A:

Got an answer. My questions was if position[i] represented the angle of rotation or the difference in angle with respect to the previous rotation position[i - 1].
The answer is, position[i] refers to the actual rotation angle.
Thank you.
