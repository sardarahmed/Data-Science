Q:

updateGZ3D.sh fails silently if grunt CLI is not installed globally,

It should be added to the instructions for gzweb JavaScript development that the grunt CLI has to be installed globally, otherwise the gzweb/updateGZ3D.sh will fail silently. Just the npm install command alone is not enough.
This is how to install the grunt command line interface globally:

npm install -g grunt-cli

Afterwards, grunt will actually build the project.
