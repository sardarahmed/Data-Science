Q:

AMCL map->odom tf-transformation

Hi everybody
I have a question regarding the tf transformation which is published by amcl.
I'm working with a husky so i use the amcl_demo.launch file to start amcl.

I build an tf tree for my lasescanner and the odometry of the robot.

I'm using 2 static broadcaster for the transformations
base_footprint->base_link->laser
robot_pose is publishing the transform odom -> base_footprint
My problem is:
If i start amcl it is not publishing the transform from map->odom. I'm getting the warning
"Waiting on transform from /base_link to /map to become available before running costmap, tf error:"
So in my understanding amcl should provide the missing transform map->odom to finish the tf tree. So why is it waiting for a transform between base_link and map?
Hoping for some help

Hey Tirgo, i got the same problem. Would you like to tell how to solve the problem?

A:

It is not obvious from your description how you are loading the prior map into amcl. Are you running a map server in conjunction with it?
Also, could you post the output of amcl? You can modify your launch file to say
 <node pkg=... type=... node=... output="screen"> 

or find the appropriate log file.
