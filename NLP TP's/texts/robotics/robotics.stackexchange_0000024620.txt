Q:

How can I set the sample rate/frequency for a Webots GPS module?

I'm trying to simulate a GPS module I have on a real robot (using ROS 2) which has a position update rate of 1Hz. Is it possible to set this in a GPS device? I'm importing the device directly to Webots from a URDF (I had to modify the urdf2webots script to include the GPS() device), but I can't find a sample_rate option in Webots so I can change that too.
These are the only settings available (this one was imported from URDF):

None of these options seem to affect sample-rate for just the GPS.
Is my only option to write a ROS node that captures the 30Hz Webots sim rate and only republishes at the desired rate? Or can this be set in Webots somehow?
Thanks all

A:

In Webots the sensor update rate is defined in the controller side when enabling the device by specifying the sampling period in ms (1Hz = 1000ms) and not in the model definition.
For the GPS device, here is the documentation of the enable function:
https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps#wb_gps_enable
If you are using ROS, then the update rate is specified using the sampling period value using the webots_ros::set_int argument of the /<device_name>/enable service.
