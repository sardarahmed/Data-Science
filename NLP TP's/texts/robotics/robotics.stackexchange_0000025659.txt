Q:

Bullet Physics Engine no longer on DRC Roadmap?

It appears the Bullet Physics Engine is no longer mentioned on the
DRC Roadmap.
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/DRC/Roadmap
Is this an oversight, or is Bullet out of the picture for the VRC?
Knowing the answer would be tremendously helpful, in guiding us as to whether to tune our controllers to work well in ODE, or hold off in hopes of a better physics engine.
Thanks,
Chris

A:

I think it's still in the Gazebo roadmap.  They keep DRC specific things in the roadmap you linked.

Indeed; Bullet integration is planned for Gazebo 1.5.  You can follow along with the pull requests that are adding Bullet support (e.g., most recently: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-request/217/bullet-integration-spawn-and-drop-simple/).
