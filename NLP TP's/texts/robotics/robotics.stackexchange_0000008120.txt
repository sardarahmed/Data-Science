Q:

Device to generate screen tap response

I have extremely limited knowledge in the general topic of robotics and therefore this question is a shot in the dark. Please let me know if the topic is unsuitable for the site.
I am interested in creating a device that would generate a touchscreen tap. In a nutshell, I would like to replicate on a touchscreen the automated mouse functionality you can obtain with software like AutoHotKey in Windows. Since, without jailbreaking the phone, a software solution is basically impossible, it occurs that one of the first components would be a physical device that simulates a tap. Do any options for such a component exist?
I recognize that there are philosophical implications with creating such a device. I am assuming the entire conversation to be theoretical and solely related to the hardware design.
Thanks,
Alex

A:

As I mentioned in this other question on the same topic, it should be easy to put a stylus on a small robot arm.  Note that since you don't need a lot of elevation difference, a gantry, Delta, or SCARA style robot is probably better than a "traditional" robot arm.
