Q:

leg_detector only publish on visualization_marker and only legs, no people

Im running the leg_detector in a simulated enviroment using the rbkairos. The leg detector does publish in the topics but does not detect any person or legs (in the topis /leg_tracker_measurements and /people_tracker_measurements) but it does publish in the topic /visualization_marker so i can see that its detecting the legs of the person. Does anyone have any idea why is happening that?
Thank you very much

A:

Try lowering the leg_reliability_limit parameter. It will publish all legs detected as markers (with varying colors of blue depending on the reliability, but only legs above the limit will be published as messages.

I tried and it works but only with a very low reliability, i thing its because the simulation enviroment. Thank you very much for your help.
(At first i tried but i did it wrong)
