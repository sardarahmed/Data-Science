A:

There's a wiki page with an overview of ways to contribute.  http://www.ros.org/wiki/Get%20Involved
I highly recommend running through a good number of the tutorials to start.  We've worked hard to try to give coverage of the core of the system.  You can get started at http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/StartGuide
