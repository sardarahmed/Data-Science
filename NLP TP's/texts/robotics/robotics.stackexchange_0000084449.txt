A:

Step 1: If you plan to use a specific ROS package, can check its compatibility with a specific ROS distribution from its ROS wiki or github page.
Step 2: After deciding on a ROS distro, from the distribution's wiki page, find out which Ubuntu version it targets. For   example, ROS kinetic is targeted at Ubuntu 16.04.
From my experience, most packages support Indigo and Kinetic

Indigo and Kinetic are also the LTS versions of ROS. http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions#List_of_Distributions
