Q:

Pointcloud to pcd file with Timestamp in name

Hello Guys,
i use Ubuntu 16.04 with ros kinetic and gazebo 7.0. I have a Gazebo world with  turtlebot in it.
I get some Pointcloud data from /camera/depth/points. Now i want to save this data in pcd files.
I use:
rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd input:=/camera/depth/points

That works well i get some pcd files. Now i want to add the timestamp to the file name is this somehow possible? Or is there something in pcl_ros that support this?
I know that most of the ros topics have a timestamp.

A:

I'm confused. By default pointcloud_to_pcd should already use the timestamp of the msg as the filename.
See wiki/pcl_ros - pointcloud_to_pcd.

Well, it is a timestamp. It's not necessarily in a format you'd like though. There is no support for any other timestamp than the unix stamp it uses now.
Note btw that it does support a prefix parameter.
