Q:

rgbdslam build error

Hello!
I tried installing rgbdslam, but got this error:
{-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rm -rf lib include bin
mkdir -p build/g2o/build
cd build/g2o/build && cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/sunilsulania/ros/g2o && make install
CMake Error: The source directory "/home/sunilsulania/ros/g2o/build/g2o" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI.
[
I have Ubuntu 11.04 and ros-electric version on my laptop. I was successful in doing same on workstation with same Ubuntu and ros versions.
The only difference here in laptop is that I dont have root, and someone had already worked on this lappy with rgbdslam and g20 etc.
I am new to ROS, will appreciate any help!
Thanks in advance!

A:

I think the error is only with g2o. Have you built g2o before rgbdslam? If not do,
$rosmake g2o
$rosmake rgbdslam
otherwise (if g2o is already built)
$rosmake --pre-clean rgbdslam.
