Q:

Robot performing soldering functions using Soldering iron

Is it possible to design and construct a Robot which can solder components using a Soldering iron on printed circuit boards?
If No, What are the limitations?

A:

Yes.  There are many soldering robots in existence today.  Unfortunately, they don't look very humanoid.  They are usually simply gantry style robot arms.  They are common on manufacturing lines.
Remember that a robot is just a machine.  And machines are designed to do a specific task, usually as efficiently as possible.  And this usually means simple, straightforward, and with the fewest extra degrees of freedom.  So a humanoid robot doesn't really make sense for this task.
Some quick google searches turn up many examples:
