Q:

Do constant fields in ROS2 topics affect serialized message size?

If I define a ROS2 field as constant, does the on-the-wire size of a serialized message change? In other words, do constant fields affect the serialized representation of ROS2 messages?
PS I am using the default middleware.

A:

No.
Looking at the binary data for a visualization_msgs/msg/Marker message saved with ros2 bag, the values of the constants don't appear in the message data. If you inspect the generated code for an interface, you may also notice that only fields are part of the message structure, constants are only defined in the api/header files.
