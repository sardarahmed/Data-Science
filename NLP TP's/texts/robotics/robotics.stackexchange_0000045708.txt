Q:

Unknown CMake command "add_action_files" during ROS install

I'm installing ROS on Mountain Lion (see possible related problems here), and I've hit a wall with the following error while using cmake:
CMake Error at actionlib/CMakeLists.txt:22 (add_action_files):
Unknown CMake command "add_action_files".

In actionlib/CMakeLists.txt, the offending line is:
add_action_files(DIRECTORY action FILES Test.action TestRequest.action TwoInts.action)

This exists both in the release version of the code both on github and on mercurial.
I haven't been able to find the add_action_files command in any of the cmake documentation – I assume it's valid, but I don't know why it's not working! Any ideas?

To clarify – I cloned actionlib manually, because the link that gitinstall used was broken. When I go into ros-underlay/common_msgs/actionlib_msgs/cmake/ I have two files – actionbuild.cmake and actionlib_msgs-extras.cmake.in . This last file contains the right macro, but apparently it's not found!

A:

Fixed it!
If you experience this error like I did, simply edit your ~/ros-underlay/.rosinstall file and change the actionlib source to git://github.com/ros-gbp/actionlib-release.git then rerun rosinstall.
