Q:

Is it possible to allow some ROS command lines to be executed automatically when a Raspberry Pi is turned on?

Hello,
For example if I want to make the roscore and some launch programs (such as Crazyflie activation launch file or VICON camera launch file....) to automatically executed whenever I turn on the Raspberry Pi. Is it possible? How can I do that?
This is because I have to do this all the time I work on my project, so I want it to be automatic.
Thanks.
