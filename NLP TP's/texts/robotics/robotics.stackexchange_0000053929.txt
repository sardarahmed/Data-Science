Q:

robot_state_publisher segfault on PR2

We have run into a problem during the uprgade of our PR2 from Ludic/Electric to Precise/Groovy.
When running robot start, the robot_state_publisher segfaults immediately. From looking at the log file it appears to successfully parse the URDF, successfully adding r_forearm_cam_optical_frame_joint, which is the last joint in the file.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to proceed?

A:

This appears to be fixed in the newest ROS Groovy packages and was resolved by upgrading all packages on both the basestation and pr2 machines.
