Q:

An error of "ERROR PYTHONPATH"

Hi,
I want to make my ROS system clean by not having this one error. The error as I pasted below after
invoking the command "roswtf". How should I go about this?
Output:
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
No package or stack in context
================================================================================
Static checks summary:

Found 1 error(s).

ERROR PYTHONPATH [/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib/src:/opt/ros/unstable/ros/core/roslib/src:/opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/roslib/src:] 
is invalid: Multiple roslib directories in PYTHONPATH (there should only be one)
================================================================================

ROS Master does not appear to be running.
Online graph checks will not be run.
ROS_MASTER_URI is [http://localhost:11311]

Thanks in advance..

Please don't put [SOLVED] in the title.  Also, don't mark every question as a community wiki, there is no reason for that.

A:

Your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is not set correctly. It should never mix multiple distributions.
When you follow the environment setup instructions, make sure you only source one version of setup.bash in your ~/.bashrc.

The first 2 lines are commented, no effect at all.

In my ~/.bashrc file, they are correct I think as the related lines are like this:
#source /opt/ros/cturtle/setup.sh
#source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash
source /home/shah/ni/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash
