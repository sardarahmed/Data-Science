welcome to ROS answers! Please consider formatting the error message (Ctrl-K) and specifying which version of ROS2 Humble you're running + how you installed (from source, debian package) and what platform you're one (e.g. Ubuntu Jammy). That way you can get faster and more specific help.

A:

This might be an open bug as per this issue.
Try:
ros2 daemon stop
ros2 daemon start
ros2 daemon status
