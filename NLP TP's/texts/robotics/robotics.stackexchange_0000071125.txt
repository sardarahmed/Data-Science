Q:

How to communicate between multiple ROS master?

I have two PCs in one robot. The PCs are connected using one router. PC1 is selected as ROS master.
I have another two PCs in another robot. The PCs are connected using another router. PC3 is selected as ROS master.
How to communicate between the ROS sub-networks? How to avoid name conflict?

I think...the idea behind networking is that you have only ONE master and so many slaves as you desire.
But to let many masters to communicate each other is not a function of ROS. I think you cannot. Or you must create some communications packets on your own.

A:

You will need to use something like multimaster_fkie or rocon_multimaster and namespace each of your robots. You can take a look at this answer about the namespacing.
