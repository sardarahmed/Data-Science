Q:

using pcl_to_laserscan

hi everybody,
i'm trying to use pointcloud_to_laserscan, for trasform the pointcloud that i obtain by the camera of a parrot, using ptam, and converting it for be able to visualize in Rviz.
i'd seen that pcl_to_laserscan use a launcher that depend from the node used etc... but i cannot find a decent tutorial for learn how to write this launchfile.
do someone had try to do that? or could help me understanding how to write the launchfile??

Thank you very much!
but now i've another missing point, this openni2.launch, that give me an error if i run the linked launchfile, what is exactly??
i'd downloaded the percetion-pcl package and catkinized it, and it does not contain any openni named file.
could you link me wich packages i need for?

openni2.launch is the driver wrapper for kinect/xtion. You don't need it, the launch represents a sample pointcloud source.
