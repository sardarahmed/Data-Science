Q:

Graphical tool to check controller performance (MoveIt, ros_control)?

Hi,
is there a graphical tool to plot current joint_states vs desired joint states which are output by moveit?
I want to visually evaluate the performance of the hardware controller / check if my velocity or acceleration params are reasonable.
Is rqt_plot the best choice? And what would be the topic for the desired joint states?
Thanks,
Chris

A:

PlotJuggler is probably easier.

And what would be the topic for the desired joint states?

For the OotB set of controllers from ros_control, you could check the state topic.
Those typically carry messages from control_msgs, which include JointControllerState, JointTrajectoryControllerState and PidState.

Thanks, when i use Gazebo, i can check the state from my position controllers (desired vs acutal), when i do plain moveit and use the fake_controller, there is no such state, is there a way to check in vanilla moveit?

Afaik, fake_controller doesn't lead to anything actually controlling anything. It's just kinematic play-out with a 'perfect robot' model. There are no dynamics.
You could check the JointState messages published by it (IIRC it does that), but that would not really tell you anything I believe. Just what the state of the play-out is.
