Q:

How to create /ardrone/takeoff topic manually?

/ardrone/takeoff topic is missing in my rostopic list command
So how do I create takeoff node manually such that my drone can fly ?

Th presence (or absence) of this topic is a symptom that you're not running the node which provides it. You should figure out which node that is for your drone, configure it correctly and run it.

It would help to know which drone you have and which commands, nodes or launch files you're already running.

I just noticed that your other question (#q286063) says that you're using the a simulator, is that still true?

Yes I'm still using the a simulator

@ahendrix you are suggesting that I should configure the node correctly, well there are only 3 nodes and none of them is having access to the /takeoff topic

@ahendrix how do I configure the node?
Comment by ahendrix on 2018-03-28:
I have no idea. You still haven't completed the first step of identifying the correct software for your drone.

A:

I'd say that you shouldn't create this topic manually as @ahendrix says in the comments of your question. As your question #q286063 shows, you're getting
Getting AR.Drone version ...

repeated which may mean that you're not connected to the drone. Manually creating the /ardrone/takeoff topic won't do anything useful.
