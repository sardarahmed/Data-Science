Q:

Building PCL with Kinfu

I am installing Point Cloud Library (PCL), without installing ROS. Now, I would like to use the open source version of Kinect Fusion (http://pointclouds.org/news/2011/12/08/kinectfusion-open-source/). So, I downloaded the latest PCL source from https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl, and then followed the compilation and installation instructions at http://pointclouds.org/downloads/source.html.
But how do I now run the Kinect Fusion implementation? I cannot seem to find any reference to Kinfu in the build files. I notice that there is a directory at /PCL/src/gpu/kinfu_large_scale, but in /PCL/build/gpu there are just some cmake files, and a makefile.
Perhaps this is something to do with the configuration, where I have not indicated that I want Kinfu to be built? I remember that when I originally ran cmake, it told me that it could not find OpenNI, so could this be the issue? I do have OpenNI2, because my camera (ASUS Xtion) does not work with the original OpenNI), but will Kinfu build with this?

A:

My apologies for not seeing this earlier but I wasn't working with ROS at all for a few years..
Looking back at my own notes, I think you are right about pcl-kinfu depending on OpenNI. From memory the OpenNI code is only necessary for capturing the data, and not the underlying algorithm, but unfortunately it is considered a core dependency by the build process. Many checkboxes only appear conditionally if certain libraries are found, therefore, if OpenNI isn't found, the kinfu-related checkboxes won't appear.
Here are my old notes if anyone finds them useful:
In CMake, make sure the following checkboxes are selected:

BUILD_CUDA
BUILD_GPU
BUILD_apps
BUILD_examples

Select Configuration Manager - the following Build checkboxes at a minimum are necessary for kinfu:

pcl_core
pcl_gpu_kinfu
pcl_gpu_containers
pcl_io
pcl_io_ply
pcl_kdtree
pcl_visualization

I have selected all four BUILD options but where is the Configuration Manager you mentioned? #ubuntu1404 #armv7 #ccmake

I think I was using Visual Studio, in which the Configuration Manager gives you the option to select/deselect a subset of libraries to build. I think all of the available ones are selected by default so you probably don't have to worry about that step - although it can speed up the compile time.

Ah, okay I thought yours might have been a situation like that. I'm on ubuntu / using a terminal program called ccmake. So far no luck building kinfu but I did found another project called Kintinuous which must be based on kinfu's initial work.
