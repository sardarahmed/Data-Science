Q:

Set log level for non-ROS nodes (my own nodes)

In rosconsole.config one can configure ROS to report not only log messages with levels INFO and higher but e.g. for DEBUG and higher:
log4j.logger.ros=DEBUG
log4j.logger.ros.roscpp.superdebug=WARN

Unfortunately this really spams the log with all the debug messages coming from ROS nodes. How do I configure ROS to use the log level >=INFO for ROS' own nodes and >=DEBUG for my own nodes?
Also what is the meaning of
log4j.logger.ros.roscpp.superdebug

Thanks in advance!

A:

Just set the logger for you nodes only, but not ros in general, e.g.:
log4j.logger.ros.trajectory_planner=DEBUG
superdebug is afaik basically a super-spammy debug. Something you'll probably never need, unless you are a core developer or have problems with the middleware/roscpp itself.
