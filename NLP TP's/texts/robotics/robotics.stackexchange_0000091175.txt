Q:

Connect camera TF tree and robot TF tree

Hello, I'm a newer of ROS.
I want to add the kinect camera to my Industrial robot working environment.
So, I follow this tutorials to set up all of confirgure.
When I launch the moveit demo.laucnch file, it shows error messages below.
[ WARN] [1553832710.822016764]: No transform available between frame 'kinect2_rgb_optical_frame' and planning frame '/world' (Could not find a connection between 'world' and 'kinect2_rgb_optical_frame' because they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnected trees.) [ WARN] [1553832710.822063875]: No transform available between frame 'kinect2_link' and planning frame '/world' (Could not find a connection between 'world' and 'kinect2_link' because they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnected trees.) [ WARN] [1553832710.822099052]: No transform available between frame 'kinect2_ir_optical_frame' and planning frame '/world' (Could not find a connection between 'world' and 'kinect2_ir_optical_frame' because they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnected trees.)

And this is the situation of TF tress.

Anyone can help me?
Thanks a lot.

A:

Your tf tree is looking for camera_link however your kinect broadcasting sensor msgs in kinect2_link frame. A simple way is that use a static transform publisher to link kinect2_link and camera_link, you could execute the following command line
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 camera_link kinect2_link 10

check this for reference
