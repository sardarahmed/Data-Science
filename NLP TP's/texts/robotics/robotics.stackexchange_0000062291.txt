Q:

Satisfying build dependencies of a stack

Say I want to build from source a collection of packages united into a stack (like navigation or image_pipline). Such stacks contain multiple packages plus a meta-package named after the stack. In order to build the whole thing, it's sufficient to type e.g. catkin_make --pkg navigation. However, the compilation will fail if some of the packages in the stack have unsatisfied dependencies.
I would expect rosdep install navigation to resolve these dependencies for me (as soon as they are properly stated in package manifests), however in reality it does not do anything because the manifest of navigation meta-package does not contain build_depend tags. I wonder why it is so, and what is the right way to satisfy the dependencies of a stack without going through each package individually.

A:

rosdep can be used to satisfy the build dependencies for your workspace, assuming your packages and stacks are in the src directory:
rosdep install --from-paths src -i

This should install the build and run dependencies for all of the packages in your workspace.
