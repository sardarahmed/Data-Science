Q:

using keyboard to control the robot in gazebo

I want to use keyboard to control my robot in gazebo. And I don't know which package should I use.
I install the "ros-indigo-key-teleop" but I don't find which node can I use.
Somebody can help? Thank you very much!

A:

You can run
rosrun key_teleop key_teleop.py key_vel:=cmd_vel
I assum your robot alrd listened to cmd_vel topic to move. The key-teleop node is publising to key_vel topic by default so you need to remap to cmd_vel.
By the way, the value published by key-teleop is 0.8 when pressing up button, -0.5 when pressing down button, 1.0 rotation speed when pressing left/right button. So the motion might not be very smooth. You can take a look at another option which is turtle teleop (http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_teleop), some remapping is still needed though.
