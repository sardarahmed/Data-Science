Q:

To get stage catkinized in Groovy

Looks like stage is still dry in Groovy and one of our packages that we recently catkinized depends on it so that we can't release the package into ROS using bloom.
All of stage's dependency looks wet (see attached snapshots of rqt_dep). Because of possible simplicity, we're thinking that we might want to catkinize it. However, I can't seem to find so far its ROS package source repository. Where is it located? Or is stage_ros what we might want to backport into Groovy?
Please tell me what's the best option for us to get wet version of stage in Groovy. Thanks.
Result of rqt_dep. Wet and dry:

Dry only:

A:

At this point for your internal processes you could backport the version of stage from hydro, but for stability we should not switch the released version of stage in groovy.
We've had several attempts to do this sort of thing on released packages which have caused signifincant regressions and interruptions to users, which is why we have the development cycle with beta testing and only should do patch releases in the middle of a cycle.
