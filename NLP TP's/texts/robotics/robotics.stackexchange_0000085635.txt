Q:

catkin_make error using rgbdsalm_v2 kinect ONE (v2)

Hello, I am running ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 on an Intel NUC and I am trying to use a kinect one (kinect v2) to generate 3D point clouds. I have soldered 12V and ground leads to pin 10 and ground and am using a 3.0 USB cable to the NUC. I have verified that the Kinect V2 is working by installing the driver libfreenect2 and executed bash ./bin/Protonect which gave me four feeds of the different sensors.
I installed rgbdslam_v2 from here using the install.sh which seemed to work and installed g2ofork too. I then exported the environment variable export G2O_DIR=home/astrobotics/ros_code/src/g2ofork, and attempted to catkin_make
the error I am getting is at the bottom of the catkin_make output
-- The imported target "vtk" references the file
   "/usr/bin/vtk"
but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:
* The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.
* An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.
* The installation package was faulty and contained
   "/usr/lib/cmake/vtk-6.2/VTKTargets.cmake"
but not all the files it references.

It seems like it cannot find libg2o. does anyone have any suggestions?

Something to consider for the future: about 90% of the log shows warnings, and only the last 10 lines had an error (which is also the only error directly mentioning g2o). It might be best to post excerpts in the beginning, and only relevant parts. Forum members will ask for more if needed.

A:

export G2O_DIR=home/astrobotics/ros_code/src/g2ofork

This is a guess, but you're probably missing a forward slash (/) here at the beginning of the path. It should be /home/astrobotics/...
Right now it's relative to whatever the CWD is, which is probably not what you want./intended.

@gvdhoorn thank you for the advice; I updated the question and the / before the directory was the issue.
