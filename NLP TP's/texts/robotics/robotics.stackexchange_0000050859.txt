Q:

Does pointcloud_to_laserscan work for ASUS Xtion Pro Live

An inquiry, wish to know of any first hand experiences where pointcloud_to_laser has been successfully used with ASUS Xtion Pro Live ? Since Xtion and Kinect are both OpenNI devices hence in principle it should work out, however a first hand account may help my efforts.

A:

Yes, pointcloud_to_laserscan and depthimage_to_laserscan work with Xtions and Kinects.  They also work with the new standalone Primesense devices.
