Q:

driver for Cloud Cap Christa IMU

I've searched in vain for a driver for the Cloudcap Crista IMU, so it looks like I will have to write/modify a driver to convert to ROS message format.  I have a specific example driver in C++ that came with the unit along with several other source files as dependencies.
I have not been able to find specifics regarding the creation of the ROS wrapper that implements this driver.  I can post the example code if need be.
Thanks in advance

Thank you Kleinma.  I did find your driver about a month ago and am in the process of putting it all together with robot_localization.  At first I had little luck, but after a late night AHA!, I discovered that it was timing-out due to the latency of my setup.  It is working fine now after making that adjustment.  Thank you so much, I thought I was the only one in the universe using this accelerometer.  Also great work on the agricultural applications!
Thanks also goes to the ROS community at large.  Such a gold mine of knowledge!  I did not think I could mix cpp and python in ROS, but the answer was here within the community.  I still have a long way to go, but now I have access to your wealth of resources and experience.   Many thanks to all.

If you do start writing a wrapper/driver, please pay attention to standards / best practices for IMUs in ROS. See ros-infrastructure/rep#95 for some recent discussion on this.

A:

You can find a ROS driver here. "Crista" is mispelled (as "Christa"). However, it should work just fine.
