Q:

planning_scene_warehouse_viewer crash

Hello all,
I've been working with the planning_scene_warehouse_viewer for a while now without any problems. However today it started to crash on start-up and has remained this way with Real Robot Data, with simulated data, and even after remaking the files from the Planning Description Configuration Wizard. Is there a way to reinstall the planning_scene_warehouse_viewer or rollback whatever I did to break it?
Kind Regards,
Martin

A:

I have found that deleting database files in the HOME/.ros/ directory can help fix some issues (I would copy them somewhere just in case you really need them).
