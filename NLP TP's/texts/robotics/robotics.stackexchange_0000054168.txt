Q:

How to visualize gmapping progress on rviz?

Hi everyone,
I managed to run gmapping to build a map from logged data. progress is going on for an hour. sequences i followed
$roscore
$rosparam set use_sim_time true
$rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan
$rosbag play 
Is there any way I can visualize progressing map real time?
best regards
Hossain

A:

In rviz, you should be able to add a map display on the left of the screen. Then set the topic to /map which is the default from gmapping. YOu might then need to set the 'fixed frame' to /map as well at the top left of rviz.
rviz shouldn't care that you are using a bagfile vs realtime topic data stream. :)
