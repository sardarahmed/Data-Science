Q:

[Kinect]About camera calibration

Hello,
I just want to calibrate the camera, but i get this message:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 5x4 --square 0.0245 image:=/camera/image_raw camera:=/camera
('Waiting for service', '/camera/set_camera_info', '...')
Service not found

Already ran:
roscore
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 

What generates this error?
Thanks beforehand!

A:

You have weird topics names for openni_launch. Shouldn't you have something like image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw and camera:=/camera/rgb (replace rgb by ir if you want to calibrate the deptch camera).
When you run rosservice list do you have services beginning by /camera/ ?
