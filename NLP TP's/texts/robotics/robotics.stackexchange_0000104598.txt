Q:

How to put ArUco markers in Gazebo Classic

The title says it all. I would like to test my robot's ArUco recognition and processing abilities by putting some markers around environments in classic Gazebo.
All the tutorials I see online seem to be for older versions of Gazebo and (frankly) use some very elaborate tricks.
What is the canonical way of adding a marker to Gazebo?
EDIT: My version of Gazebo is 11.10.2, by "older versions of Gazebo" I mean older versions of Gazebo classic specifically. Sorry for any confusion.

A:

To generate the objects themselves what I found the easiest was to use this repo which takes in a bunch of images and outputs models that Gazebo1 can understand. There is a brief tutorial video for the repo on Youtube as well.
You then have to put those models in a folder that makes sense for your project and, here's the key thing:
Wherever those models are stored, you have to put the folder they are in into the environment variable GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH.

EXAMPLE:
Say my workspace is in ~/my_ws/ and inside there I have a folder called mymodels.
Then I would run this whenever I activate my ROS2 environment:
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:mymodels
Along with other things like source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash etc.

One last thing: I had to go into the model.sdf file for each of the markers I generated and reduce its size. I don't know how the sizing in that repo is supposed to work but the marker objects it generated for me were enormous. Thankfully it's pretty easy to do in the scale tag.

1: Gazebo Classic, in my case 11.10 on Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2 Humble
