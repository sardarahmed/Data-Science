Q:

How regular users should deal with a spam?

Sometimes there is a spam on Answers, e.g. like today. So, how regular users should deal with it? I mean those ones who have insufficient karma to delete the entire question/answer/comment.
For example, my karma is enough to Close a question, but not to delete it. However, for the answers and comments there is only Delete option which I cannot use.
I tried to downvote some of the spam answers today, but got negative points for this. Probably because it was several answers from the same user.
So should it be left for moderators (are there any?) or we have to take some action too?
Thanks

That tommox is annoying. We cannot do anything but wait for administrator to block his account.

A:

If you click the "flag offensive" button (above comments, below the post), it will put the message into a queue for moderators (and remove it from visibility).

Is it easy to find all the comments made from spammers account? Because this time spambot(?) not just created the questions, but also answers.  And the only option for answers and comments is Delete, it is not possible to flag it. I was thinking that downvoting can help moderators to identify spam

So I see a "flag offensive" next to this answer (although not on comments). Do you not have that option? Perhaps there is some other setting that is wrong which is requiring a high karma level for flagging answers.
Comment by Boris on 2013-03-26:
Yeah, I don't have this option, only 'delete' and 'link'.
Comment by Chik on 2013-03-26:
Haha! I only have 'link'. Not even have 'delete'.
Comment by Boris on 2013-03-26:
That is actually weird, I have 'delete', but I can't use it -- it says that over 1000 karma is required.

very funny :-D

I have edit, delete and link on this answer and edit, retag, close, delete on the question. No flag offensive. (But since i got >1000 karma, i probably dont need it anymore) Is there a possibility to see the moderators? And all my flagged posts remained visible in the past. (at least to me...)

Nice to see I'm not the only one. Askbot upstream post done.

@Boris the "delete" button issue is a bug indeed, I will try to fix it asap on this site.
Comment by Evgeny on 2013-03-27:
@felix k thank you for bringing these up, I will fix these within 3 days (possibly need to do some work to update the theme to the current version of Askbot as well).
