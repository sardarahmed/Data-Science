Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Rviz crashes

I changed the transport hint in Image tab at rviz from 'raw' to 'tf' and it crashed. Now I am facing this error while opening it. Re-installation and recompilation did not work. How to pass through it? Thanks
[ERROR] [1338181335.401547975]: Caught exception while loading: Unable to load plugin for transport 'tf', error string:
According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class image_transport/tf_sub with base class type image_transport::SubscriberPlugin does not exist. Declared types are  image_transport/compressed_sub image_transport/raw_sub image_transport/theora_sub

A:

rviz saves it's config in the '.rviz' subfolder of your home folder. The easiest option is to just delete the entire 'rviz' folder (it will be re-created on the next rviz startup). You could also look into the config files and try to edit them as to fix the error.
