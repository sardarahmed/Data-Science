Q:

Husky Simulator in kinetic

I've simulated Husky in Ubuntu 16. But there is something seems to be wrong.
The Husky packages  for Kinetic are downloaded from here.
When I execute
 $ roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch

Gazebo will start. The interface of it and all models seem to be normal. However, error messages will come up in Terminal, like this :
[ERROR] [1500815218.577764934, 1298.710000000]: Could not load class joint_state_controller/JointStateController: Could not find library corresponding to plugin joint_state_controller/JointStateController. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists. 
[ERROR] [1500815218.577845132, 1298.710000000]: Could not load controller 'husky_joint_publisher' because controller type 'joint_state_controller/JointStateController' does not exist.

Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists. 
[ERROR] [1500815219.617082514, 1299.750000000]: Could not load controller 'husky_velocity_controller' because controller type 'diff_drive_controller/DiffDriveController' does not exist.

 [ERROR] [1500815220.618012, 1300.740000]: Failed to load husky_velocity_controller

Then execute
 $ roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch

There will be something wrong in rviz  with the model's all four wheels :
Display--RobotModel--StateError--front_left_wheel_link--No transform from [front_left_wheel_link] to [odm]
Are  there anyway to solve this problem???

@JohnBT: please use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) for console copy-pastes (including code, xml, errors, urdf) next time. Without it, error msgs are filtered (and thus invisible) and other text with formatting will not render correctly.
Thanks.

I get the impression that you don't have the ros_controllers package(s) installed.

The Husky packages for Kinetic are downloaded from here.

Have you made sure to install all required dependencies?
Simply cloning that repository is not enough.
Please run
rosdep update
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src/ --ignore-src

That will most likely install packages like ros-kinetic-diff-drive-controller and ros-kinetic-joint-state-controller.
Then try again.

Note btw that the husky packages have not been released yet into Kinetic, so even if things build correctly, it may still not work due to changes in some of the dependencies (Gazebo is v2 on Indigo fi, but v7 on Kinetic, and there have been many changes between those two versions).
