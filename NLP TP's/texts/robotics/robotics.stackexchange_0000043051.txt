Q:

SSH into Turtlebot?

So my workstation and computer are finally connected, and now it tells me to ssh into the laptop from the workstation. When I type in "ssh turtlebot@192.168.1.101" (the ip of the laptop being 192.168.1.101), I am prompted to enter a password. The password is not the normal password of the computer, and when I guess incorrectly three times, it tells me "Permission denied (publickey,password)". what does this mean? how do I find the publickey?
**Here is the info of the laptop**
hyness@turtlebot:~$ ifconfig

**From Workstation**
ssh turtlebot@192.168.1.101
turtlebot@192.168.1.101's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
turtlebot@192.168.1.101's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
turtlebot@192.168.1.101's password: 
Permission denied (publickey,password)'

WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

Normal password of which computer? It should be the password of the turtlebot user on the laptop. Did you try that?
Comment by buma676 on 2012-08-08:
yes, I tried that multiple times... why does it mention publickey?
Comment by bit-pirate on 2012-08-08:
did you copy your workstations public ssh key to the turtlebot laptop? If so, you might have entered a passphrase for that specific key. Try that one.

Hi, I am completely new to turtlebot and linux, i am facing the same problem too, I am just using one laptop connected to the turtlebot. When i type in turtlebot@10.23.0.37's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
I have tried the root password but it didnt work.
How to find the password?

A:

The way you are using ssh, you are ssh-ing the turtlebot acount on turtlebot. If you entered "turtlebot", the default password for the turtlebot account, it should log you in. So, to log into your account, run this instead:
ssh hyness@192.168.1.101
