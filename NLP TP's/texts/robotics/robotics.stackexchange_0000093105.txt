Q:

Communication occurs only one way between devices

Hello,
I am using the talker and listener nodes to check that the communication occurs between my raspberry pi and my system. I am running Kinetic in the system and using ubiquity robotics image in the RPi which has ROS pre-installed. I am only able to send data from the RPi to the system but not vice-versa.
Here are the setup lines in my .bashrc files:
In System
export ROS_IP=172.20.10.8
export ROS_HOSTNAME=172.20.10.8
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://172.20.10.9:11311/

In RPi (Master)
export ROS_IP=172.20.10.9
export ROS_HOSTNAME=172.20.10.9
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://172.20.10.9:11311/

Here are my etc/hosts files
In System
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   01HW822483
172.20.10.9     172.20.10.9
172.20.10.8     172.20.10.8

::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
172.20.10.9 172.20.10.9

In RPi
127.0.0.1         localhost
::1                  localhost ip6-localhost ip6-lookback
ff02::1            ip6-allnodes
ff02::2            ip6-allrouters

172.20.10.9   172.20.10.9
172.20.10.8   172.20.10.8

I have also included the rqt_graphs.
When i run talker on the Pi and listener on the system, i can echo the /chatter topic. But when I do the reverse, i cannot observe anything in the topic.

This are the errors I get when i run roswtf

When trying to communicate from the system to your raspberry, do you have a roscore running on the raspberry ?

Yes, I do have a roscore running on the raspberry

It was a firewall problem.
Thanks guys.
