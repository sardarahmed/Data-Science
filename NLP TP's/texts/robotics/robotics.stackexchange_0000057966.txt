Q:

Groovy and Hydro with same catkin workspace

Hello folks,
Easy question. I know that I can install Groovy and Hydro at the same time on my computer since they are going to be installed on different folder in /opt. I know I need to source differently depending on which distribution I'm using but can I use the same catkin_ws for Hydro and Groovy at the same time or do I need to have two different workspace  like catkin_ws_groovy and catkin_ws_hydro for example ?
Thanks

A:

Since a catkin workspace captures the workspace that it was built on top of as part of the build process, you'll need to have two separate workspaces.

Just as a note: You might want to use symlinks in your src folder to only have one common checkout of your code for both workspaces.
