A:

it seems you might have a corrupted gazebo tarball, try
roscd gazebo
make clean

and rebuild.   If that fails, you can download the tarball first using wget:
wget https://code.ros.org/svn/release/download/thirdparty/gazebo/groovy/gazebo-r3c730325a4dd.tgz

then move the downloaded file into gazebo package
mv gazebo-r3c730325a4dd.tgz `rospack find gazebo`/build

and then remake.
