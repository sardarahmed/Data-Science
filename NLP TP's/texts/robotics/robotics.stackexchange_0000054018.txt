Q:

Linking error -lplanning_models not found while building rgbslam

I was presented with the following linking error -lplanning_models not found while building rgbslam. Does anyone know which package this lib belongs to or which package is depending on this lib?
Thanks

A:

planning_models seems to be in the arm_navigation stack. It is unclear to me where this dependency should come from. Please don't use hashes (#) for the tags.
