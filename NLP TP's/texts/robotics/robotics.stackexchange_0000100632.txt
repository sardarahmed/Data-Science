Q:

rqt_error_messages

Hello
I have a problem to call the rqt. I followed the guide from e-Manual (Link:https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/basic_operation/#teleoperation) and would like to see the topic list from rqt. After I typed
rqt
it showed following error messages:
" Traceback (most recent call last):

raise UserWarning('icon "%s" not found' % str(path))
UserWarning: icon "/opt/ros/melodic/share/rqt_virtual_joy/resource/input-gaming.png" not found"
Can anybody help me to solve this problem?

A:

To fix this error, need to install the missing package rqt_virtual_joystick:
https://github.com/aquahika/rqt_virtual_joystick
Suggested installation:
mkdir -p joystick_ws/src
cd joystick_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/aquahika/rqt_virtual_joystick
cd ..
catkin_make
echo 'source ~/joystick_ws/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

To test: rosrun rqt_virtual_joy rqt_virtual_joy
Notice that the package is rqt_virtual_joy
