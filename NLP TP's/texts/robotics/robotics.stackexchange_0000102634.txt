Q:

How to fuse maps constructed by two different sensorsï¼Ÿ

I saw in the paper that the Bayesian filtering method can be used to fuse the two maps. For example, I used a depth camera and a lidar to build their own maps. I don't quite understand how Bayesian filters fuse maps, because I only know that Bayesian filters can be used to estimate the pose of robots.

A:

You can certainly combine maps using Bayes methods if they are transformed into OccupancyGrid maps, here is an example package:

and a paper "Occupancy Grid Map Merging for Multiple Robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping":

Some software helps with working with different sensor maps, e.g.

https://github.com/awesomebytes/occupancy_grid_python

https://github.com/ANYbotics/grid_map

Could you please link the paper you read? Then we could maybe help you more.

@ljaniec  The article I read is here  https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2203/1/012029/pdf chapter 4.3
