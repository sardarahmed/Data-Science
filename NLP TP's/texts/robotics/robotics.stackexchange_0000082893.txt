Q:

simple Q about where to install packages

let's say I want to download ros-kinetic-ros-tutorials through
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials

where do I need to be cd'd into at that time or does it matter?
I am currently in catkin_ws/devel, is that going to be fine?
also, in general, when installing packages, does the same answer apply?

A:

You can run
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials

from anywhere. You don't need to be in a certain directory to use that command. apt should install this into your /opt/ros/<distro>/share/ directory without you having to be in that directory yourself.

also, in general, when installing packages, does the same answer apply?

Depends on how you're installing them. If you're using apt, like above, then you let it deal with that. If you're installing the source (such as cloning from a git repo for example) then you would compile and install it from the root of your catkin workspace.
