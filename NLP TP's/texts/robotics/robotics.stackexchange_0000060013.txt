Q:

Focus camera on origin of moving frame in rviz

Hey all,
Im quite new to ROS, did a lot of tutorial stuff lately and didn't find an answer in the answers database.
My program has 2 frames. A fixed "world" frame and a "ego" frame, that is moving within the fixed one. Rviz is set up with a .rviz config file. Now I wonna know, if it's possible to focus the camera on the moving frame and update camera every time the moving frame changes relatively to the fixed frame.
If yes, do I have to modify my .rviz config file or my program?
I think these are the important lines of my .rviz config file:
Views:
Current:
  Class: rviz/Orbit
  Distance: 139.139
  Focal Point:
    X: -1.5004
    Y: 59.5032
    Z: -26.4407
  Name: Current View
  Near Clip Distance: 0.01
  Pitch: 0.839797
  Target Frame: <Fixed Frame>
  Value: Orbit (rviz)
  Yaw: 5.10348

edit Thanks for your answers so far. But It turned out i meant something different to what I explained ^^  I dont want to move things relative to the ego frame. I still want to target the world frame, but tell rviz to set the focal point according to the ego frame that is moving within the world frame.
I found the documentation of the rviz::VisualizationManager that controls the visualization of rviz:
For example, there's rviz::ViewController with a method lookAt(float x, float y, float z) or
rviz::OrbitViewController with a method move(float x, float y, float z) that might work in this case, but I don't quite find a way to use these in my program.
Got any ideas on that?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I think that what you want can be done setting the Target Frame to the "ego" frame, because now it's fixed.
