Q:

roscore giving error on WSL machine

I have WSL (windows subsystem for linux) on my windows  PC and I've been trying to follow the instructions given in the tutorial here - ROS wiki page - I'm using ROS indigo version. As per the instruction in the tutorial when I try typing

$ roscore

I get the following traceback error

What could be the possible solution for this?

A:

Please see #q238646.
You're likely not running a recent Win10 (Insider) build.
Btw: running ROS on WSL is really very experimental at the moment. Personally I would not use it for anything apart from some experimenting perhaps.
