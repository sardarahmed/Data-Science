Q:

Installing Gazebo from source on Ubuntu 14.04 : Unable to locate package libqwt-qt5-dev

Hi,
I am trying to install Gazebo from source on Ubuntu 14.04 (would wish to be on 16.04 but I unfortunately need another library for my project which is only supported on 14.04...).
So I followed the procedure found here : http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install&tut=install_from_source&ver=default
and while installing the dependencies, at step 3 "Install prerequisites", got this message error :
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package libqwt-qt5-dev

I understand I don't have libqwt-qt5-dev, but when trying to install it :
sudo apt-get install libqwt-qt5-dev

I get :
E: Unable to locate package libqwt-qt5-dev

Not sure, but looking at this, it seems that the library has no package for 14.04 : http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libqwt-qt5-dev
So... my question would be what is the most recent version of Gazebo to use in 14.04 and how to install it from source? Even when I change the Gazebo version in the tutorial, I get the same procedure (or maybe I do not see the difference).
Thanks in advance, any help is really appreciated.
Regards,
David

A:

Finally, I found out what was my problem. In this Gazebo tutorial (this links to the Gazebo 7 version of the tutorial as Gazebo 7 is the last version available on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty), the first steps are the following :
wget https://bitbucket.org/osrf/release-tools/raw/default/jenkins-scripts/lib/dependencies_archive.sh -O /tmp/dependencies.sh
ROS_DISTRO=dummy . /tmp/dependencies.sh
sudo apt-get install $(sed 's:\\ ::g' <<< $GAZEBO_BASE_DEPENDENCIES) $(sed 's:\\ ::g' <<< $BASE_DEPENDENCIES)

So I looked at the file /tmp/dependencies.sh in gedit and found out that I need to specify GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION=7 prior to running the script so that it does not look for libqwt-qt5-dev. So here is what I suggest to those trying to build Gazebo from source on Ubuntu 14.04. When installing the dependencies at the begining of the procedure in the tutorial, do the following instead :
wget https://bitbucket.org/osrf/release-tools/raw/default/jenkins-scripts/lib/dependencies_archive.sh -O /tmp/dependencies.sh
ROS_DISTRO=dummy GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DISTRO=trusty . /tmp/dependencies.sh
sudo apt-get install $(sed 's:\\ ::g' <<< $GAZEBO_BASE_DEPENDENCIES) $(sed 's:\\ ::g' <<< $BASE_DEPENDENCIES)

Just added GAZEBO_MAJOR_VERSION=7 DISTRO=trusty to the second command line.
Then, building Gazebo from source (using gazebo7 branch) worked fine.
