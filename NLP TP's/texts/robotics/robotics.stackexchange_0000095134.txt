Q:

can't run graph with command rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot

hello! I'm new to this site and ROS
I just finished installing ros and wanted to get some graph...
so I just typed the command
rqt_plot rqt_plot

this logs got showed up
$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/matplotlib/axis.py:1015: UserWarning: Unable to find pixel distance along axis for interval padding of ticks; assuming no interval padding needed.
  warnings.warn("Unable to find pixel distance along axis "

    raise LinAlgError("Singular matrix")

I don't know why I get this error... I think I installed ROS properly...
Could someone please give me a hand to solve this error..
and just nevermind that tags.. I am the first time in here so I don't know how to include tags properly..
My OS is Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS is kinetic and 1.12.14
Thank you for your hand in advance...

so you don't know which ROS version you are using?

I also have such an error.  Did you solve it?

I didn't solve this problem yet....

I was running the same tutorial and got that error. Looking at the documentation for rqt_plot, it uses pyqtgraph first (preferable), then resorts to matplotlib if pyqtgraph is not installed. Try pip installing pyqtgraph, it worked for me! Not sure what the issue is with matplotlib though...

one of my friend told me that I can run plot
type "rqt" and "plugins-visualization-plot" then you can use the plot graph and someone just answered my question XD

A:

you can just invoke the rqt_plot by running

rqt

which will open the Standard GUI
and then traverse through plugins->Visualization->Plot  to get the MatPlot
FYI : this is kinda workaround !!! works for this tutorial, I think one should give a more concrete solution
