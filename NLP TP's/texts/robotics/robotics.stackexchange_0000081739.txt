A:

I have already a Metapackage and have indexed all my packages at rosdistro.

if you have already done that -- and all the jobs for it have run -- then you should get the additional links under the version rocker automatically.
Just make sure you have all your packages listed as run_depends (manifest v1) or exec_depends (manifest v2) of your metapackage.
