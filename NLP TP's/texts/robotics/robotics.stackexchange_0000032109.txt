Q:

Documentation on writing hardware drivers

Good evening, I am working in the Biorobotics Lab at the National University of Mexico, my workmates and me are working with mobile domestic services robots made of custom hardware. I am getting interested in ROS as a tool to speed up robotics research, but our robots have hardware which is not covered in ROS. So I would like to know if there is any documentation on writing hardware drivers for ROS.

A:

There are quite a number of tutorials available for specific hardware (lasers, imu, Dynamixel servos) and general ROS message handling at http://www.ros.org/wiki/AllTutorials.
Some of the stacks supplied by other organizations include complete examples of working ROS code including hardware drivers (PR2, wubble, erratic, turtlebot, Pioneer P2OS), http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots.
There is a partially completed tutorial on writing a serial I/O hardware driver at http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/Creating%20a%20Simple%20Hardware%20Driver, but that won't help.
If you provide some more information regarding what particular devices you are interfacing to, then others can likely point you to the particular ROS stacks that are applicable.
Additional information:
Chad Rocky presented a guide to writing Hardware Drivers at ROSCon 2012 program, slides, video
Melonee Wise presented a guide to ROSifying a robot at ROSCon 2013: program,  slides,  video
