Q:

Documentation/references on how ROS works internally?

Hey,
I am doing a project for my Uni involving ROS and in one of the chapters of the thesis I should talk about the state-of-the-art of ROS (i.e. how it really works internally).
Are there any documents that describe this? In the papers section I can only find information about specific experiments, not the ROS system itself.
Cheers,

A:

You have this information in the ROS wiki http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Introduction also there is the paper ROS: an open-source Robot Operating System.
I hope this is what you need!

Yes! That's great. In the introduction part I found the parts for Technical overview and High level concepts highly useful.
Thanks!
