Q:

How to install robotnik Summit-xl stack?

Hi all. As stated in the title, I am trying to install Summit-xl from robotnik. First I downloaded the tar.gz file from its website. Then I extracted it out to my sandbox and try to rosmake it. However, rosmake have been unsuccessful,

Does anyone here install Summit-xl before? In addition, how do you do install stacks from ROS, in general?  Thanks you.

rosws set --svn summit-xl-ros-stack http://summit-xl-ros-stack.googlecode.com

A:

Your directory structure suggests that you may have seen these instructions already, but just in case, you should refer to this answer.
From the looks of the error message it seems that the provided zip file assumes that users will unzip it in the /opt/ros/fue.. I hope not though..
Quickly browsing the current versions of the code doesn't show anything strange.. so I'd suggested that you try checking out http://summit-xl-ros-stack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/trunk/summit_xl_sim_fuerte.

Hi Trinighost, I tried checking out the URL you provided, but it doesn't seems to exist.Please see update 1.
Comment by SL Remy on 2012-12-03:
updated... sorry about that.. I just "knew" that ...trunk/trunk... had to have been a mistake on my part.. oh well
Comment by ChengXiang on 2012-12-04:
It's alright. Well even after checking out from source,the error still exist.(Please see update 2) Does that mean I need to unzip the stack in opt/ros/fuerte/stacks? I tried that once, rosmake still fail though.
Comment by SL Remy on 2012-12-04:
./summit_xl_ctrl/Makefile sets the CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR to /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/summit_xl_sim/summit_xl_ctrl... but this is autogenerated so this should be set in one of the parent folders
