Q:

Gazebo 1.4: model.config vs manifest.xml

In the tutorial Make a Mobile Robot for version 1.4 instead of creating manifest.xml for a model it is suggested to make model.config. However Gazebo 1.4.0 (built from source) does not see the model in this case. Everything works fine when I use manifest.xml.
Do I have an odd build or there is a mistake in tutorial?
Thanks,
Boris

A:

Gazebo 1.4 will first attempt to find a model.config file. If a model.config doesn't exist, then Gazebo will attempt to find and use manifest.xml.
This is the behavior in the released version of Gazebo 1.4.
manifest.xml is being deprecated because it can be confounded with manifest.xml from ROS.
