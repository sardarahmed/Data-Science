Q:

Where is catkin_add_nosetests() documented?

Apparently, that is the catkin way to run Python unit tests.
I can't find any documentation for it via Google.
UPDATE: For future reference: Dirk found it under Development Documentation.

+1. For Hydro it might be http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/catkin/html/dev_guide/generated_cmake_api.html#catkin-add-nosetests

A:

All of the CMake macros were self documented, at some point there were docs generated for them:
http://ros.org/doc/fuerte/api/catkin/html/macros.html
But now they seem to have gone missing. You can see the documentation for that particular macro here:
https://github.com/ros-shredder/catkin-release/blob/master/cmake/test/nosetests.cmake
I am not sure why we are not generating documentation for CMake macros anymore. Perhaps @Dirk Thomas can comment on that.

Thanks for the pointer William. I opened a bug ticket on the missing docs: https://github.com/ros/catkin/issues/384

The link to CMake source code should be changed to https://github.com/ros/catkin/blob/noetic-devel/cmake/test/nosetests.cmake

Similarly the link to ROS documentation should be changed to https://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/python_nose_configuration.html
