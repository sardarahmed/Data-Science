Q:

Joints velocity units

Hi!
This is quite a simple question. What are the units that Gazebo uses for joints velocity? what do we get with GetVelocity? or what do we set with SetVelocity?
I checked the Joints class reference, but I couldn't find anything.
Thanks!

All units in Gazebo standard SI (meters, seconds, radians, etc).
