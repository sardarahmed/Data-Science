Q:

roslaunch command line args

Read through all the tutorials, but couldn't find the answer to this one. I have a ROS node executable, which I can run like this:
./my_node -arg1 -arg2

I can also start it using roslaunch and a my_launch.launch file:
roslaunch my_launch.launch

How do I specify arg1 and arg2 when starting using roslaunch? I.e. how do I get arg1 and arg2 to show up in argc and argv?

A:

If you using raw command line arguments then you'll need to use the args attribute of the node tag in your launch file are described in the node tag documentation.
The example below will work in your case:
<launch>
  <node pkg="my_package" type="my_node" name="node_instance" args="-arg1 -arg2" />
</launch>
