Q:

turtlebot_bringup error - invalid  tag

I installed turtlebot packages from debs. When I run minimal.launch I get the following error
while processing /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/turtlebot/turtlebot_bringup/launch/includes/_robot.launch:
Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: no such command [/opt/ros/groovy/share/xacro/xacro.py '/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/turtlebot/turtlebot_description/robots/kobuki_hexagons_kinect.urdf.xacro']. 

Param xml is <param command="$(arg urdf_file)" name="robot_description"/>

I am getting this error after running ubuntu updates this afternoon. I did not get it before the update. Is anyone else getting the same error ?
Thanks,
Prasanna

I never update Ubuntu. This helps a lot ;-)

New version of xacro has been released yesterday (now version 1.7.3). Download and test it to see if it solves your problem.

I downloaded a new version of xacro doing : "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-xacro" and it works fine for me now, even with the roslaunch command.

A:

You are probably hitting the bug in the new version of xacro, which has been introduced when catkinizing it.
Have a look at this ticket for more details: https://github.com/ros/xacro/issues/1
The bug fix should soon be pushed to public.
Please report back, if you are still having issues after the update.

Guys, I'm sorry to inform you that you need to wait a bit longer for a bug fix. The bug fix in xacro release 1.7.3 only solves the problem of 'rosrun xacro xacro.py ...', but not the roslaunch issue. Follow this ticket for more details: https://github.com/ros/xacro/issues/2

@bit-pirate I installed the new xacro release and now the roslaunch works fine except for the laptop battery warning which I have described here - http://answers.ros.org/question/56704/turtlebot-2-errors/?comment=57279#comment-57279
