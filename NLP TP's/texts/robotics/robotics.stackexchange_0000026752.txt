Q:

How to simulate Temperature and create an office room

1)i want to create a room from a greyscale image, i have seen two methods using gazebo:
with the tag  but with this i can't apply a texture to the side of the wall,
but only from the hight, and with the tag  but this doesn't work, and i don't undertand why,
the sdf file is:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

  
    
    
    
      model://sun
      0 0 20
    
   
   
      model://ground_plane
    
  
      
    
      0 0 1 0 0 0
      
        
            2 2 2  
        
        
            2 2 2  
          
            1 0 0 1
            1 0 0 1

        </image> 
      </geometry>
    </visual>

</model>

i want to simulate a physics element like the temperature in environment and to relevate it
with a sensor, is this thing possible to do? are there any projects available?

thank you for your answer

A:

The  geometry model is broken in Gazebo, see this issue.
Temperature is currently no implemented in Gazebo. The easiest solution is to write a WorldPlugin that outputs temperature data. Example world plugin. Every update cycle, your world plugin could get the position of you robot, and then output a temperature value to a topic.

You can create a subscriber to a topic. From the command line, you can use the gztopic -h command.
