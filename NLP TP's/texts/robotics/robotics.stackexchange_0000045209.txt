Q:

Build and Move a simple human character model in rViz

Hi Guys!
I'd like to build a simple human model in rViz and be able to move it.
Actually, something pretty similar to this little app which I've developed using Ogre and Qt:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0WP0kd4sOU&feature=youtu.be
Here I could basically map the output from each inertial sensor,to the corresponding character body segment.
Is it possible to achieve the same in rViz?
Do you have any suggestion or sample code to share?
By the way,  even a simple "stickman" model could be enough :)
Thanks everybody!
Luca

Does the video this page (http://www.ros.org/wiki/skeleton_markers) count as a simple stickman model?

A:

I also think RVIZ might not be the best choice for this purpose. You can take a look at the MORSE simulator. It's a simulator based on Blender and comes with a human model that can be controlled using Kinect (also via ROS) like in this video:

It's open-source, so you can also take a look at the code. You find more information here:
