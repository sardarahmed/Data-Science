Q:

Invoking "make -j8 -l8" failed

Hi I get this error while building Object Recognition Kitchen and have no idea what to do:

The actual error is most likely somewhere earlier. Please try catkin_make -j1 and copy/paste the actual error message in your question (use the edit button/link for that).
Comment by sykatch on 2015-10-20:
@gvdhoorn I just edited my question
Comment by mrslvgg on 2015-10-20:
it seems you don't have access to SDL/SDL.h. Can you post the complete path of this header?
Comment by johnny zhou on 2017-06-10:
catkin_make -j1  helped me. thank you

Hi I get this error while building Object Recognition Kitchen [..]

Have you ran rosdep check --from-paths /home/tomas/ork/src --ignore-src to make sure you have all required dependencies installed on your system (such as SDL)?

I got this. What does it means? I'm a total newbie to these problematics.
System dependencies have not been satisified:
apt libosmesa6-dev
apt meshlab
apt libsdl1.2-dev

Comment by joq on 2015-10-23:
It means you forgot to install your dependencies before building. Try a similar rosdep command, but substitute install for check.
Comment by William on 2015-10-23:
Substitute check for install?
Comment by joq on 2015-10-23:
No, run rosdep install --from-paths /home/tomas/ork/src --ignore-src
Comment by sykatch on 2015-10-24:
It helped thanks.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-10-24:
Thanks @joq. Reason I asked to run check first is because I don't like to give ppl commands that could potentially break their system. Running rosdep install .. would've been in a follow-up edit.
Comment by joq on 2015-10-24:
@gvdhoorn: I quite agree, but was concerned that @sykatch still didn't seem to understand the problem.
Comment by addext on 2019-09-03:
hi, I ran rosdep check --from-paths /my/path/to/workspace --ignore-src and got All system dependencies have been satisfied. Any ideas?
Comment by Paul Sebastian on 2019-10-15:
@addext. Even I got the same thing. Did you solve it?
Comment by addext on 2019-10-28:
@Paul Sebastian I did not solve it "the clean way". After struggling with it for days, I ended up reinstalling ubuntu and ROS.
