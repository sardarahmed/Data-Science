Q:

Model Plugin does not load

Hey guys,
I am trying to do the following:
run a world with a world plugin -> world plugin creates a model (also with plugin).
If I create a sensor with a sensor plugin (dynamically with the world plugin) then the sensor plugin is loaded. The model plugin is not...
I tried multiple versions of gazebo (1.4, 1.6, 1.9). Can you give me a hint?
Here are some code snippets:

Does it give any hint why? error / warning msg? I used to do this as well and I think it worked.

First very embarrassing error: I forgot to set the plugin path for the model plugin lib... but this is not the solution.... I will upload some more code and the output (there are no error / warning msg -> its just not loaded)

Second error: after the _parent->InsertModelSDF(sphereSDF); in the load method of the world-plugin there was a " node->WaitForConnection();" that waited for a message from the model plugin.... very stupid errors... sorry

Looks like @Chris answered his own question in the comments.
