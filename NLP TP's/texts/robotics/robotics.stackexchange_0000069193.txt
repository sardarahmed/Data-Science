Q:

How to correctly reset time

I am using a bag in a loop because it is just convenient to keep the bag running and testing different algorithms.
The problem is that once the bag starts from the beginning, my nodes using tf start printing out a lot of warnings about TF_OLD_DATA. To solve this, an empty message should be published to /reset_time.
I tried pushing the reset button in RVIZ but nothing happens and for example amcl complains about old tf data. Is there any solution to that problem?

A:

You can use the --clock parameter in rosbag (e.g rosbag play --clock wg-cafe.bag). This way the TF buffer clears automatically on negative time.

i am running this command only and nothing happens instead.i start gmapping slam_gmapping in one termonal and in other i start the rosbag play --clock file.bag. And nothing happen in the gmapping terminal, And error comes 100% messages dropped. I am using to record bag file of tf and scan in p3dx.
