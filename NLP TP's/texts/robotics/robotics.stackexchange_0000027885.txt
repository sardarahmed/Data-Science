Q:

Gzweb not load well my world

I have create the following world C:\fakepath\road_drone_textures.world.
with gzclient Works perfectly but in Gzweb, when load the second lamp shows the following error:

I has tried to solved it and I have edited gz3d.js adding a "if" to comprobate that link[0] exists (line 1613).
if (link[0])
        {        
        if (link[0].self_collide)
            {
                link[0].self_collide = this.trueOrFalse(stats.link[0].self_collide);
            }
            if (link[0].gravity)
            {
               link[0].gravity = this.trueOrFalse(stats.link[0].gravity);
            }
            if (link[0].kinematic)
            {
              link[0].kinematic = this.trueOrFalse(stats.link[0].kinematic);
            }
        }
      }

This is part of the function:  GZ3D.Gui.prototype.setModelStats = function(stats, action)
I don't know how this will affect to gzweb consistency but solved part of my problem:

the problem now is that gzweb not shows the road. Any idea's as solve it?
