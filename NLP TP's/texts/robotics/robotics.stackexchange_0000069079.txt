Q:

Fetch & Freight robot: sudo service robot stop

Hi Everyone.
I am newbie to ROS and my lab just have a fetch-freight robot. I was playing around with it, but get the error with rviz, so I tried to uninstall/reinstall ROS.
But now, I can not use the remote control to control the robot, as well as I tried to run the command:
"sudo service robot stop"
(http://docs.fetchrobotics.com/care_and_feeding.html)
But I got the following error.
robot: unrecognized service
Please help. Thank you very much.

This seems like a robot specific problem. The manufacturer might help with this.
