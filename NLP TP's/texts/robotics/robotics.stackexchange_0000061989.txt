Q:

raspian - installing ros from source

Hi,
I tried to install ROS on a raspbian image (supporting collada and rviz) following the Wiki: http://mediabox.grasp.upenn.edu/roswiki/groovy%282f%29Installation%282f%29Raspbian%282f%29Source.html
Collada naking and insatllaing worked. According to the tutorial I created a ros_catkin_ws and got the sources from git. The make command is using catkin_make_isolated, which should be in
$ sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install --install-space /opt/ros/groovy
as a source, but it isn't.
The Get command I used (according to the wiki) was:
$ rosinstall_generator --rosdistro groovy desktop > /tmp/groovy_desktop.ri
$ sudo wstool init src -j1 /tmp/groovy_desktop.ri
Does anyone have an idea, why the catkin sources aren't in ./src and how can i git the catkin sources additionally?
Thanks in advance

A:

You probably want to pass --deps to the rosinstall_generator.
If that works you can update the documentation here: http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Raspbian/Source
