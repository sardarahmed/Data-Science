Q:

Uwsim how to add Mass to terrain cirs_trident

Hi I am using UWSIM package.
I loaded the CIRS scene. Everything is working fine. My problem is that the AUV passes through the wall of the terrain. I tried adding some mass to my terrain, but it sank when I gave it mass. Is there a particular way to do it? I jut want my AUV to collide with the walls of the terrain and not pass through it.

Hi,
In order to have collision responses you need to launch the dynamic module and use a force sensor as input for external forces on it. You can directly launch it using the launchfile in underwater_vehicle_dynamics using "roslaunch underwater_vehicle_dynamics UWSim_g500_dynamics.launch", The results should be the same as in this video.
Hope it helps!
Edited: As you experimented in your comment I forgot to say you will need to send messages to the thrusters input ("/g500/thrusters_input" by default) it's a Float64Multiarray setting the effort to vehicle's thrusters from -1 to 1. In the case of girona 500 model it uses 5 thrusters first two forward/backward, the second pair up/down and the last one for lateral movements, this can be configured through a yaml on the underwater_vehicle_dynamics package although is not straight forward. SetVehiclePose and setVehiclePosition won't work in this mode of work as dynamics module is controlling positions and velocities.

Hello, Yes it helped me.
But I still have some questions. I am trying to use the functions setVehicleVelocity and setVehiclePose now. But the movement of the AUV doesn't seem correct now. Is it supposed to be different with this dynamic module?

True, I edited the previous answer ;)
