Q:

Can't change minimum laser range with asus xtion pro

I'm using an asus xtion pro camera with a turtlebot 2 and I noticed that it only registers scans that are at least 0.45 meters away even though the edge of the robot is around 0.3 meters.  I changed the parameter value for "/depthimage_to_laserscan/range_min" to 0.2 but this has no effect on how close it detects obstacles.
How can I change the minimum laser range?

A:

In my experience, the Asus Xtion Pro itself has a minimum range of 0.5 meters (actually the official specifications say the minimum range is 0.8 meters) so it is not a problem with the depth_image_to_laserscan parameters.
If you need to see obstacles closer than 0.5 meters away you will need a different sensor.

Okay, I just verified this, thanks!  This is a huge hardware limitation especially for autonomous gmapping.
