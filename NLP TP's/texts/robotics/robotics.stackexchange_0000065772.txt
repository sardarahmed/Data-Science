Q:

Error connecting Staubli CS8 robot to ROS

Hi there !
I have a robot Staubli tx60 and I want to connect it with ROS, I have a package for that but it doesn't work:
I get this message:
[ERROR] [1423580378.785944834]: Failed to connect to Staubli CS8 Controller.

This message comes from the package not from ROS.
in the other side I have my CS8 emulator in other machine in windows7:

The objectif is to connect CS8 Emulator that has an IP address with ROS using a package
Anyone worked with CS8 emulator in ROS ?
This is the package that I use.

There is probably more output on the console than just this single error? Could you update your post with some more context as well?

@gvdhoorn I just edit my question and add more information

A:

I did some modification in main function:
instead of:
if ( argc<2 || (strstr(argv[1],"http://")!=argv[1]) || !strstr(argv[1],":800/") )

I use
if ( argc<2 || (strstr(argv[1],"http://")!=argv[1]) )

And it works !

Yes that first line doesn't really make sense. Nice to hear that it works now. You should accept your own answer, to mark it answered.
