Q:

executable '[]' not found on the PATH

I am trying to launch the first example from the ros2 control demo package: https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos/tree/humble.
I am using ROS2 humble on ubuntu 22.04. First I built every package successfully, then sourced the install/setup.bash and started the launchfile with:
ros2 launch ros2_control_demo_example_1 view_robot.launch.py

But I received the following Error.
[ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): executable '[<launch.substitutions.text_substitution.TextSubstitution object at 0x7f6a81793cd0>]' not found on the PATH

I did not change any code from the example. It would be nice if somebody could help me or tell me what the problem is?
Here is my Traceback:

A:

The solution was that I had to install all the dependencies with rosdep. I forgot this step. Thank you @ChristophFroehlich
