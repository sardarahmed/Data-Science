Q:

Boost python not found when building cv_bridge under OSX

I am having the problem that cv_bridge can't find my boost libraries although it must have found them for the packages before when installing hydro on OSX.
When I look into /usr/local/include I can see all the boost files and folders, also python.
What's the problem here?
When I print the output of my boost libraries it says none.
CMAkeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project(cv_bridge)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS rosconsole sensor_msgs)

find_package(Boost REQUIRED python)
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
message("Include dirs of boost: " ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS} )
message("Libs of boost: " ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ) 

Output:
CMake Error at /usr/local/Cellar/cmake/2.8.12.2/share/cmake/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:1111 (message):
  Unable to find the requested Boost libraries.

  Boost version: 1.55.0

  Boost include path: /usr/local/include

  Could not find the following Boost libraries:

          boost_python

  No Boost libraries were found.  You may need to set BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the
  directory containing Boost libraries or BOOST_ROOT to the location of
  Boost.

  CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package)

That cmakelists.txt works as expected over here. What version of OS X are you on? Also, I would start by  brew update, brew remove boost cmake, brew install boost cmake to make sure nothing funky is going on with your installs.

Did you manage to solve this? I currently have the same problem. Thanks

A:

Recent changes with the homebrew boost formula removed python from being built by default. You will have to manually  brew install boost --with-python or brew reinstall boost --with-python. See https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/issues/330

I just updated the rosdep rule for boost to include boost-python.
