Q:

launch scripts for gazebo

I am moving from Player/Stage/Gazebo to ROS. Working with Gazebo, in Player/Stage/Gazebo used to be with world files (viz. gazebo pioneer2dx.world) however in ROS it is with launch files. So, my first question - how to make launch file for the corresponding world file ?

@Arkapravo: If your issue has been sorted out, I would rather you didn't post -- it will distract from questions that still need answering.

@kwc @hsu : Hi Ken, Hi John - the second question has been sorted out. But for the community - I probably should post it as a separate question. Okay with both of you ?

Please do not send personal e-mails, and please do not ask separate questions in the same post.  All information must be posted here if you wish for your questions to be answered. I am removing your second question -- please repost with all relevant info if you wish for it to be answered.

regarding the second question, please clarify "doesn't work"

A:

If you want to launch Gazebo using an empty world and then put your_robot (URDF) model into that world you can use:
  <!-- Start Gazebo. -->
  <param name="/use_sim_time" value="false"/>
  <node
    pkg="gazebo" type="gazebo" name="gazebo"
    args="$(find gazebo_worlds)/worlds/empty.world">
  </node>
  <node
    pkg="gazebo" type="spawn_model" name="spawn_your_robot"
    args="-urdf -file $(find your_robot_model)/your_robot.xml -model your_robot">
  </node>

Further, you can create a node called your_robot that broadcasts a transform for your robot. If you want to see your robot move in Gazebo, then the your_robot node also needs to publish the state of your robot on the topic gazebo/set_model_state. See this page for more details about what ROS Gazebo publishes and subscribes to.
Alternatively, you can use the Gazebo services to make your_robot URDF model move in Gazebo.
