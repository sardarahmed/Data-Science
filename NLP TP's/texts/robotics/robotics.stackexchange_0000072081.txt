Q:

Does gmapping resize the map if required?

I'm using gmapping. The default map-size is a 4000x4000 cells (200m x 200m) occupancy grid map stored in a 1x16,000,000 1D array.
What happens if I make the default map-size a 200x200 cells map (10m x 10m) and the map has to be extended in action?
Does gmapping do this itself or would this be a problem?
Thanks for your help.

A:

Yes, Gmapping allows for map growth. I also believe it uses a tiled map representation behind the scenes (see HierarchicalArray2D), so it should be multiple 1D arrays instead of one (with additional ones being added when the map grows).

Thanks for the quick answer.
Your answer brings up another question to me:
The published topic "map" is of type "occupancy grid" which uses int8[] for data.
Is the HierarchicalArray2D also used there? Or only for internal calculation?

The hierarchical grid is only used internally. It is converted to a standard ROS occupancy grid message.
