Q:

Communicate between my python library and ros

I have a python class called primitive_surfaces that uses the script called primitive_shapes.py to find waypoints. Initially, I had a main that would instantiate an object of primitive_surfaces with required arguments and print out the waypoints.
I'm now planning to use this code and publish the variable waypoints using ROS. How can I communicate between non-ROS Python scripts and ROS?
Apologies if this question has been repeated many times, I'm fairly new to ROS and couldn't seem to find anything relevant.
Thanks :)

A:

You can use rospy inside of any python script as long as you have setup your ROS environment first.
