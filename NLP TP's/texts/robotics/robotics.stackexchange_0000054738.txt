Q:

seesaw macros not working with chrome

With Chrome Version 30.0.1599.66 (the current), the seesaw macros at http://wiki.ros.org/seesawexample don't seem to work.  Specifically, if I click on "Bash" then on "Compiled" nothing is shown.  Confused me for a while before I tried Firefox, where this works logically.
Actually, I noticed this while trying to follow http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/TurtleBot%20Bringup, where I couldn't see/find the Deb Installiation Instructions, but the example also doesn't work for me.
ps. sorry for the broken links, answers.ros.org says I need more karma to publish links :(
