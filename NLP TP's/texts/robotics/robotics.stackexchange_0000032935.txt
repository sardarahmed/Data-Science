Q:

rviz drawing with the mouse: 3D shapes

Is there a package for letting the USER draw 3D shapes in rviz?  For instance, I would like the user to draw a sphere in rviz to select a subset of point cloud data.  Or maybe have the user draw a 3D vector on 3D sensor data.
Thanks so much.
Mike

The only interactive interface we have in RViz is interactive markers:

It is available in ROS Electric.
