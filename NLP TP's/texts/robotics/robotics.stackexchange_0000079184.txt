Q:

Is there is trajectory planner for quadrotor / holonomic robot in ROS?

Hi All,
I wan to control a quadrotor with move_base package, this quadrotor is stable controlled by it's on-board processer, so I just need to move it.
But the problem is this quadrotor can not accept velocity_yaw command, or if I send rotation command it will become very unstable.
So, I want to know is there a path planner for only translation without rotation?
Thanks..

A:

you can use the teb_local_planner package and set the parameters max_vel_theta: 0 and min_vel_theta: 0.
In that case, the planner generates only translations. You need to set the yaw_goal_tolerance: 6.28 as well in order to prevent that the planner desperately tries to rotate towards the final orientation.
