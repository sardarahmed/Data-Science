Q:

Depending on bullet in a catkin package (Groovy)

Dear all,
I was wondering how to find bullet header in a catkin package (Groovy).
As far as I can tell, I should not use rospack to do so but as no CMake macro is provided by ros-groovy-bullet, I don't quite see how to achieve this... Any suggestion?
Also, bullet seems a candidate of choice for the new buildsystem, is there a switch planned from rosbuild to bloom?

The switch would be from rosbuild to catkin (bloom is not a buildsystemin a strict sense).

A:

It is not possible to depend on a rosbuild package from a catkin package. So until the bullet package has been migrated, this will not be possible, and dependent ROS packages cannot be migrated neither.
An alternative (that might not be good for your use-case) can be to use cmake conventions to use a system install of bullet.
