Q:

How to publish a ROS msg on Linux terminal

I have a ros msg as follows
int32 x
int32 y
char type
I want to give values to them on linux terminal. Something like this:

rostopic pub /topic message -- 2 3 'x'

But it doesn't work. I am using ROS Diamond.

A:

The ROS wiki gives this as an answer example.
$ rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  '{linear:  {x: 0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}'

Depending on your message type you can simply follow the pattern given above; in which case you won't need -- in your command. Instead wrap the message data in single quotation marks and use the YAML map syntax. For example:
$ rostopic pub /topic package/msg_type '{x: 1, y: 2, c: a, type: string}'

Im trying to publish this exact same msg using unity3d via RosBridge. But its not publishing. When i try publishing in ros ,it works. But doesnt publish using unity(which sends a JSON string)...
PS using ROS Kinetic along with unity 4.6.

Thanks for the answer. For the command...
$ rostopic pub /topic package/msg_type '{x: 1, y: 2, c: a, type: string}'

it's worth mentioning that pay close attention to space(s)!!
e.g. x: 1 will work but x:1 won't.
