Q:

goal status in Callback in actionserver in C++

Hi all,
My client sends the goal but gets status ABORTED instead of SUCCEEDED and server gives following error:
[ WARN] [1337607518.317686823]: Your executeCallback did not set the goal to a terminal status. This is a bug in your ActionServer implementation. Fix your code! For now, the ActionServer will set this goal to aborted

My callback is
void startnode(const my_msgs::myGoalConstPtr& goal, Server* as)
{ 
  my_msgs::myResult result_;
  result_.result = 1;
  as->setSucceeded(result_);
}

Can anyone help me fix this problem??
Thanks in advance.
Regards

This unanswered thread was closed due to 'off-topic or outdated', but I find the same error can still happen today and no other threads discuss this error. So I reopened it.

A:

As pointed out by the error message, fix the termination state in your Action Server. In rospy sample, not calling set_succeeded can lead to the error in this question. OP asks for C++ but I haven't tried, so I can only assume that the equivalent is setSucceeded.
