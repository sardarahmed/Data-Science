Q:

Compilation Wall of Errors Seemingly Unrelated to .cpp

Hi guys,
I've been writing a ROS publisher/subscriber node in C++ on ROS kinetic using a Navio2 board. When I attempt to compile, I don't get any syntax errors, but instead get a wall of errors involving dependencies, serializations, and whatnot:

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/8c11d52bb03cfe8c9aa576086f57c2e2

Can anyone tell me what's going on? I'm new to ROS. Thanks

A:

In my CMakeLists.txt file, I added target_link_libraries(roscomm ${catkin_LIBRARIES}) and everything's working now

I should have asked you for your CMakeLists.txt before making assumptions about C++11.
I was under the impression you already had everything setup for linking, but checking #q300573 we see that you link against catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS there, which won't work.
