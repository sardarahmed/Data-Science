Q:

Add elements (obstacles, walls, etc.) in a URDF file

I've just started to learn how to implement an URDF. To do it, I'm following the tutorials about URDF in ROS Wiki.
But, those tutorials only talk about how to define a robot, but If I want to add obstacles or walls to show them in Gazebo. How can I do it?
Maybe I can add those things inside the world definition.

A:

You can use the exact same primitive geometry elements box, cylinder and sphereto define obstacles.
A flat box is a wall fi.
Then use a fixed joint to attach them to your world.
Although if you're going for Gazebo, then using SDF might be better.
Treat Gazebo as providing you "virtual hardware". Use RViz to visualise your robot's sensor data. Not the world directly.

Thanks. Do I have to put them inside the robot tag?

Yes.
The robot tag is not special, it's just the root of the file.
You can model entire worlds "in" it.
