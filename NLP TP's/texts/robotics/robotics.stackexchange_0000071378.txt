Q:

Trouble installing rgbdslam_freiburg

This is an easy one but I'm very new to ros and am having a bit of trouble. I'm trying to install rgbdslam for rosdep.
The trouble starts here:
~/rosbuild_ws$ rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg

ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query Missing resource rgbdslam_freiburg

So I check to make sure I downloaded the code to the right place with:
~/rosbuild_ws$ printenv | grep ROS

ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/jade/share/ros 
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/jade/share:/opt/ros/jade/stacks 
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311     
ROS_WORKSPACE=/home/jackson/rosbuild_ws 
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES= 
ROS_DISTRO=jade 
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/jade/etc/ros

Here is the contents of /home/jackson/rosbuild_ws
~/rosbuild_ws$ ls -la
total 32
drwxrwxr-x  3 jackson jackson 4096 Jan 15 17:44 .
drwxr-xr-x 21 jackson jackson 4096 Jan 15 17:43 ..
drwxrwxr-x  4 jackson jackson 4096 Jan 15 17:44 rgbdslam_freiburg
-rw-rw-r--  1 jackson jackson  290 Jan 15 17:42 .rosinstall
-rw-rw-r--  1 jackson jackson 1697 Jan 15 17:42 setup.bash
-rw-rw-r--  1 jackson jackson 6756 Jan 15 17:42 setup.sh
-rw-rw-r--  1 jackson jackson 1474 Jan 15 17:42 setup.zsh

I've also tried moving the directory rgbdslam_freiburg to /opt/ros/jade/share and /opt/ros/jade/share/ros with no success.
What else do I need to be doing?

A:

I installed Ubuntu 12.04 instead of 14.04 performed the RGB-D SLAM for "Not-yet" ROS Users (it's at the bottom of the page)
NOTE you have to make sure you have ros mirrors setup or you won't be able to set everything up:
