Q:

No /camera/rgb/points, Natty

Hi!
I install ROS-electric on fresh Natty(2.6.38-11-generic) with updates using this tutorial. Next, I try to launch openni_camera with this sample.
Everything is normal, but in rviz there is no /camera/rgb/points topic. Where can be problem?
So, there are some details:

Logs from roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch - http://pastebin.com/z4YVUgEn
rviz's sreenshot - http://imageshack.us/f/51/screenshot0906201102235.png 
Thanks for help!

Does /camera/rgb/points show up when you do rostopic list?

A:

I'm guessing that you followed the Diamondback instructions at openni_camera. I see that I somehow introduced a mistake there (wrong launch file) when updating the docs for Electric, sorry! That's fixed now.
Note that wiki pages may have different versions for different ROS releases (C Turtle, Diamondback, Electric) which you select by clicking the button for your release at the top of the page. Be careful you use the right docs.
To add confusion, there are actually two versions of the OpenNI ROS driver in Electric. The old version is the one from Diamondback, which we've preserved for backwards compatibility. So you can actually still follow the Diamondback instructions.
The new driver is a tad experimental, but much more modular and introduces new features. It has a couple of breaking API changes; in particular /camera/rgb/points no longer exists, use /camera/depth_registered/points instead. See the Quick Start instructions at openni_launch.
