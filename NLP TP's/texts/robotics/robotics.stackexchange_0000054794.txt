http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node/Tutorials/UsingTheHokuyoNode
Hi guys,
I am currently doing the tutorial above and I know this is quite stupid to ask but do you guys know how do I get to know my orientation of my robot(current just a sensor)?
What kind of ros command?
PS: using ROS fuerte

There is not simple command to get the orientation as that must be defined first. Orientation relative to what? Are you looking at pitch/roll angles only or do you care about orientation in some fixed world frame? In the latter case you need an algorithm like SLAM or localization.

I need to know the yaw pitch roll and the angle of the robot.

Do you only have the laser as a sensor? Do you have a map that you localize in?
Comment by FuerteNewbie on 2013-10-13:
Yes I have a hokuyo laser as my sensor, as I am doing amcl I not yet have a map, just trying to figure out how can I display all those data in prompt or whatever to show it is functioning well.

Without a map and other input, you need a SLAM approach like hector_mapping.

How am I suppose to do?
