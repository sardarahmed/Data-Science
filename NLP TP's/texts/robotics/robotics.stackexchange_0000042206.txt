Ok. So I have a installed and build a group of packages , between them the amcl packages. But would like to run the amcl node only. So I have only one lauch file for the whole package system. So dont have a launch file for the amcl package. Can I use the lauch file for the whole system?

where is placed this package turtlebot_navigation/config/amcl_turtlebot??? I can not find it.

A:

Please have a look at the amcl wiki page and some sample configuration files. For instance, the amcl configuration for the Turtlebot can be found in the package turtlebot_navigation/config/amcl_turtlebot.launch. You probably won't be able to use that amcl launch file out of the box because some topics might not match, i.e. you'll maybe need to fix the topic remapping.
