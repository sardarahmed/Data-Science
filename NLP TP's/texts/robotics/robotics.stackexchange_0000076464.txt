Q:

Having problems with velodyne VLP-16 and ros

Hi, I'm new to ROS and Linux so my question may be very stupid. Sorry for that.
I want to connect VLP-16 and laptop (in fact i need to connect it with raspberry pi, but i first wanna try it on laptop). I tryed to use tutorial "Getting Started with the Velodyne HDL-32E". I wasn't surprise that I fail with it. So I tryed to solve problems in different ways but i didn't succeed. So i decide to write post here.
Maybe i should solve problems step by step.
So. Could someone explain how should I work with velodyne driver and VLP-16 and how can I find out my VPL-16 ip on Ubuntu?
I use Ubuntu 12 and ros "fuerte". On raspberry I would use "indigo" instead.
Thanks and sorry for my bad english.

Hi again. Ty for your help. Now i build velodyne_driver from source but I still don't scceed.
First in tutorial "Getting Started with the Velodyne HDL-32E" I need to do that steps:

Power the LIDAR via the included
adapter
Connect the LIDAR to an Ethernet port on your computer.
Statically assign an IP to this port in the 192.168.3.x range.
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.3.100

Add a static route to the LIDAR's IP address. The IP address can be
found on the CD case which was
included with the LIDAR.
 sudo route add 192.168.XX.YY eth0

How could I find what XX and YY should be? I don't have any CD included.
And after that. How could I know are my ip settings set correctly (look any data on my laptop recived by VLP-16)?
Thanks.

A:

As far as I know the standard address of the VLP-16 is 192.168.1.201.
So what I'd do is:
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.200 dev eth0
sudo route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0
Afterwards you should have access to the vlps webinterface via your browser. Then run the vlp driver, and make sure the rpms set in driver and webinterface match.

I did all as you recommend. After that I tryed to enter in my browser 192.168.1.200 or 192.168.1.201 and it said that it "Unable to connect".

saw in your other topic that you are using a vm. That would have been valueable information ;).
