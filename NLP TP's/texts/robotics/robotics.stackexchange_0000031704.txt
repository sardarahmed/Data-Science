Q:

Turtlebot Purchasing Options

For those of us who already have a few Roombas and Kinects lying around, is there going to be an option to buy some of the hardware from Turtlebot independently from the whole kit?
I am mainly interested in purchasing the IMU and the shelving "stack" that comes with the Turtlebot kit.

A:

We decided to make the TurtleBot hardware open source.  We're working on posting the docs and linking to suppliers for all the parts, including the shelving stack and gyro/power board.  So you will be able to buy them separately.  Check back soon at turtlebot.com.
