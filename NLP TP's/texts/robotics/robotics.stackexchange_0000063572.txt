hi, this is my first time here.

does anyone solved this problem?
thanks ,
Ryo.
ps
ros_controllers package cause other catkin_make problem, so i tried this
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-control ros-indigo-ros-controllers

but another error occurs

[ERROR] [1414652580.407543556, 4.281000000]: Exception thrown while initializing controller joint1_position_controller.

[ERROR] [1414652581.462662991, 5.332000000]: Initializing controller 'joint2_position_controller' failed

I checked  rrbot_control.yamland rrbot.xacro, but of course there was a state about joint1 and joint2.
could you tell me where to check for?
thanks

A:

I think i solved the problem.
the problem was rrbot.xacro
in the state
replace
<joint name="joint1"/>
with
 <joint name="joint1">
  <hardwareInterface>EffortJointInterface</hardwareInterface>
</joint>

and all error was cleared
thanks for your help.
