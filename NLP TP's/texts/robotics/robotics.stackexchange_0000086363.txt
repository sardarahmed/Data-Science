Please see @fivef's answer in #q54178. This is the first result when I perform a search with Google using your title as the search term:
https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+compile+single+package+in+catkin_ws
catkin_make --pkg <package-name>

For example, building a package named turtlebot
catkin_make --pkg turtlebot
