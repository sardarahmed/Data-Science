Q:

nao bringup error

I'm just getting started with a nao, and i'm getting an error when I try and run the bringup launch. I've been following the nao tutorials for ros and the install went fine. When I got to the getting started tutorial the code, the following line produces an error :
roslaunch nao_bringup nao_full.launch

error:

This is with roscore running. I've also tried this with and without running naoqi first.
Both my computer and the nao are on the same network.
In the Choregraphe program, the nao is also not visible.
EDIT JULY 6, 2015
I got Choregraphe to connect to my Nao by downloading a different version, version 1.14.5 instead of the latest build.

A:

For me, this seems as if you try to connect to the wrong IP.
Can you verify that your NAO_IP is set to the correct IP of your robot?
when in doubt, start your program like this:
NAO_IP=<ip_of_your_robot> roslaunch nao_bringup nao_full.launch

Then further, please check that naoqi is running successfully on your robot. If not, the bridge can't connect to it. You can check also by opening choregraphe and see if the camera is working fine.
