Q:

update the map_server

Does anyone know a way to update the map that map_server uses? AFAIK, the map is set to the contents of an image file as soon as the node is launched, then remains static for the life of the node.
My situation is as follows: I have two nodes this job mapper and map_server. Mapper records ultrasonic range measurements into a png file, and has a service for saving updated versions of the map. How can I push updates of the map to my map_server node??
Will I have to relaunch the map_server node every time? Thanks

A:

I think you're doing it too complicated. If your Mapper node already has a map there is no need to send that to the map server. Just publish it from the Mapper node at the /map topic.

You're right. I changed the Mapper node to publish its own OccupancyGrid, and this was a lot simpler. It's working quite well now.

But what if I need to publish an occupancy grid only after some editing, can I have map_server continuously publishing?

Yes...............

In fact, it just publish the same occupancygrid without updating it even if the grid has changed
