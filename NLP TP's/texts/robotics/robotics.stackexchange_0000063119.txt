Q:

Is there a difference between Ubuntu versions

Hi community
I have currently developed all packages I need using Ubuntu precise and ROS hydro. 
I know that it could be some hassle to move to ROS indigo. 
But can there be any problems involved to move to another Ubuntu version? 
Or in other words: How do I choose the right version of Ubuntu to use for my robot?
Thanks for your help

A:

If you're developing with Hydro, your best (and only) choice for ROS distribution is 12.04. All other distributions supported by hydro have been EOLed (end-of-life) and are no longer receiving updates. Since precise is LTS, it will be receiving support and updates on the important bits (i.e. libraries, kernel) until 2017.
If you want to take advantage of a newer distribution - 14.04 (supported until 2019), the migration to indigo for most code is extremely painless.

This means ... if I want to use 14.04,  have to move to indigo - otherwise I stick with 12.04?

Yes, that's the case.
