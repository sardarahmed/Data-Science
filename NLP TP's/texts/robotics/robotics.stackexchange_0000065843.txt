Q:

Add mysql library to ROS package

Hi, I would like connect ros node with a Mysql DB but I can't do it. I don't know how use mysql lib client in Ros node because when compiled it appears error as undefined reference to `mysql_get_client_info'. I'm try use cpp cflags export in package.xml but I can't found the correct way to do it.
Thanks in advanced.

A:

If this is a catkin package, treat the CMakeLists.txt as you would any ordinary CMake package.
Use find_package(..) and friends to look for the MySQL headers, libraries and other files. Then add those to your include path (include_directories(..)). Make sure to link your node executable to the libraries (target_link_libraries(target_name ${mysql_LIBRARIES})). Make sure to check the names of those Find script variables for yourself, as I did not check them.

I'm try use cpp cflags export in package.xml but I can't found the correct way to do it.

cpp flags is something from rosbuild, which isn't used/supported anymore under catkin.
