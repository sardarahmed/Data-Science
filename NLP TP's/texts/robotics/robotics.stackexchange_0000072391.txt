Q:

Install ROS on Linux Mint 17.3?

Hi,
I'm setting up a new computer for running ROS, and I want to use Linux Mint 17.3 as the base.
I've found one thread (http://answers.ros.org/question/118151/install-ros-on-linux-mint-16/) that refers to Linux Mint, but haven't gotten as far as beginning the installation process yet.
Have anyone tried installing ROS on Linux Mint 17.3? Anything different I should be aware of compared to Linux Mint 16?

Did you try to install? I think that there is not problem because LM 17.3 still based on Ubuntu 14.04. Just follow the tutorial on the Wiki for Indigo version

Hey FrodeL,
did you got an workaround to install ROS (Jade Turtle) on Linux Mint 17.3?
I would like to do the same. Because i got Mint on my PC and won't set it up again with Ubuntu.
Thanks

No, I ended up with Ubuntu instead.
