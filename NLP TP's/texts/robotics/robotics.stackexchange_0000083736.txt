Q:

How to choose different robot footprint type for DWA_local_planner

Hi folks,
I wanted to know how the DWA_local_planner computes (or chooses) the foorprint of the robot? is it a dot (or a circle based on the inflation added to the robot)? If yes, my question is that is it possible to give another type of the robot's foot print to the DWA_local_planner? (for example by line or two circle, something like the TEB_local_planner?
Thanks in advance,

A:

in your costmap config
if it is a circle you can set
robot_radius: 0.35
if it has a more complex shape, then represent is as a polygon:
footprint: [[0.1, 0.0], [0.0, 0.1], [0.0, -0.1], [-0.1, 0.0]]
