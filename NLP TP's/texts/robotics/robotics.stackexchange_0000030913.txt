Q:

AddTwoInts example with minus

Probably very simple and dumb question. I have code similar to AddTwoInts example. How to enter negative values there?
tonu@hp:~/tyros/phippi/ros/phippi$ rosservice call phippi_motors -0.2 0.2
Usage: rosservice call /service [args...]

rosservice: error: no such option: -0
tonu@hp:~/tyros/phippi/ros/phippi$

A:

This tool uses the YAML commandline syntax described here.
To fix this particular problem, you would separate your arguments from the command's options using --. For example, rosservice call phippi_motors -- -0.2 0.2 should work.
