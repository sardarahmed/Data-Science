Q:

How can I send JSON data to and from ROS?

I am currently working on a task that involves constant intercommunication between a web browser (using roslibjs) and the ROS system through the rosbridge server. Is there a way to send JSON-formatted data from the browser to a ROS node? I realize there is no JSON among the ROS system's standard data types.

I'm confused: if you are already using roslibjs and rosbridge_suite, you are sending (and receiving) JSON data to (and from) ROS.
Can you clarify what it is you actually want to do?

A:

(follow up to my comment)
If you want to send JSON encoded data as part of a message to a ROS node, then I don't believe there are any special provisions for that.
Most straightforward would probably be to define a new message that stores the JSON string in a field. Any receiving node will have to know it's JSON though.
