Q:

Is ROSARIA going to be made available in Groovy?

http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA
The instructions located on the wiki page appear to be for ROS-F, and the ROSARIA packages do not appear to be available for ROS-G.
Also, the p2os driver is missing from ROS-G. (Understandable since it hasn't been maintained for well over a year.)
Suggestions?

Keeping track of progress, I think I found the repo ROSARIA is from: https://code.google.com/p/amor-ros-pkg/

A:

I have updated the wiki page with a solution. Use rosws to grab the packages directly from the upstream repo and build per the existing instructions on the wiki.
