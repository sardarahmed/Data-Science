Q:

Travis CI with 14.04/Indigo and/or alternatives

Looking into continuous integration options, the obvious one is Travis CI. To my dismay I quickly discovered that it is really easy to use, but unfortunately the offered servers only run Ubuntu 12.04, so builds requiring Indigo/14.04 are not easily possible. There is a new Docker-based build environment in place (description here), but the limitation of not allowing running sudo makes things very complicated.
My questions thus are: Are there any solutions out there that make it possible to run 14.04/Indigo with Travis? How do other current options for CI compare to Travis? What I especially like about Travis is the fact that no (server) infrastructure has to be maintained by the user.
/edit: Just came across this question: drone.io instead of travis. Certainly sounds like an alternative, but no instructions for use with 14.04 so far either.

A:

As of mid-October Travis supports Ubuntu 14.04 trusty! I've been running travis with ROS indigo without any problems.
To get running in a trusty build environment, you simply have to add the following to your .travis.yml file:
sudo: required
dist: trusty
