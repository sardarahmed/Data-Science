Q:

Will cartographer ignore parts of robot that is scanned?

Hi,
Just a quick question,
Will cartographer automatically detect and ignore parts of the robot that is scanned by the LIDAR or do I have to somehow set it in the urdf file or somewhere else in the config?
Thanks.

Not quite sure what you mean. The LIDAR will scan the environment not the robot. If you mean will it ignore the environment it's already scanned then it'll recognise an area of the map it's see before

Depending on the position of the LIDAR in the robot, it's possible that it sees part of the robot (e.g. some mounting parts)

This is typically called self filtering, and as far as I know (but do prove me wrong please), cartographer does not do this.

Is there any guide/tutorial on how to do self filtering? Do I do it before passing lidar data to cartographer?

A:

Check out this package. http://wiki.ros.org/laser_filters You need to filter the current scan topic and publish the filtered scan into a new topic.
