Q:

How do I find out a topics data type?

I'm using rosbridge to get camera data from a ros to a non-ros device
I can see the topic /camera/depth/points but I'm not sure what "type" it is. For now I'm using std_msgs/String but I'm not sure if that's it. How can I find out for sure what the "type" is?

You've got to be kidding me..
Regardless, thanks.

Also, it helps to use rqt for stuff like this so you don't have to memorize command line stuff. The Topic Monitor plugin shows all the topics, their types, and you can monitor their values.

[..] so you don't have to memorize command line stuff.

I guess it's a matter of opinion, but personally I do prefer to "memorize command line stuff", as I don't need to start UIs for something as simple as this. Works across SSH sessions as well, and platforms without X.
