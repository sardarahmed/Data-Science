Q:

how to add package to source install

I am building ROS Indigo from source for a BeagleBoneBlack running U13.10 via these instructions:
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source
I was able to build ros-comm without any problems! YAY!
Now, what is the best way to also build urg_node and all it's dependencies? I hope the anwser is not to make an overlay work-space, manually git clone the source, look in package.xml for more deps, and then git clone those... I imagine that there's some way to use ws tool to automaticly pull urg_node, and it's dependancies such as sensor_msgs for building into either the existing src folder created in the above tutorial, or in an overlay on the install_isolated?
Sorry for being long winded, I just wasn't sure how to phrase the question, but I hope you get what I'm asking... ;)

A:

For released packages you can use the rosinstall_generator: http://wiki.ros.org/rosinstall_generator
It looks like urg_node isn't released, so I think you'll have to do some manual work. Basically, if something isn't released, there isn't any meta-info about where to get the source, or what branch to use for indigo. I'd suggest starting at urg_node, working backwards to add dependencies, but as soon as you reach released packages use the rosinstall_generator. I tried running the rosinstall_generator on all build dependencies of urg_node, and got:
rosinstall_generator  --rosdistro indigo --deps roscpp rosconsole sensor_msgs nodelet dynamic_reconfigure tf laser_proc diagnostic_updater urg_c
The following not released packages/stacks will be ignored: diagnostic_updater, laser_proc, urg_c
... <lots of rosinstall stuff for the other deps>

Since urg_node isn't released for indigo (and doesn't even have an indigo-devel branch), i wouldn't expect it to compile right away - you'll probably have to do some hacking.
