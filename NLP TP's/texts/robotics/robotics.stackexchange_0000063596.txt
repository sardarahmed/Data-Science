Q:

No devices connected... Waiting for devices to be connected

Hi,
When I start 3dsensor.launch I get:
[ INFO] [1414430559.252574176]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

When I rosrun openni_camera openni_node by itself I get the same error.
I've trawled rosanswers looking for a solution, but nothing's worked yet. : C
lsusb lists the kinect; I've followed the suggestions here, and the suggestions here, and the suggestions here, and the suggestions here, and here to no avail.
This is being run on a turtlebot2, and both the turtlebot and the workstation are on 14.04 trusty and indigo igloo. The kinect is plugged into the usb 2.0 port.
lsusb yields:

Turtlebot specs are:
Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty
Memory 1.8 G
Processor Intel Celeron @ 1.50Ghz
Graphics intel ivybridge mobile
OS type 64 bit
I'm at a loss. does anyone have suggestions?
I'm not entirely certain if it's related, but when I start up my minimal launch I get this:

What do you get from lsusb? and how did you start kinect? what's your pc spec?
Comment by Kongaloosh on 2014-10-28:\

I've updated the question with the contents of lsusb.

The kinect is listed there, as it should. I started the kinect by making sure everything is connected. All the lights are green.

Which computer do you want the specs for, the workstation or the turtlebot?

Comment by jihoonl on 2014-10-29:
turtlebot's spec would be helpful

A:

It turned out the solution was to get an openni patch. This resolved the connection error.
However, I now have a minor issue with RVIZ.
From the 3d Launch I get:
[ WARN] [1414934636.270421799]: Camera calibration file /home/turtlebot/.ros/camera_info/depth_0000000000000000.yaml not found. 
[ WARN] [1414934636.270594235]: Using default parameters for IR camera calibration. 

rostopic echo camera/depth_registered/image_raw produces numbers, and I get a point-cloud visualization.

Comment by lokus on 2014-11-26:
i've the same problem but im getting the openni drivers from apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-camera and ..-launch and executing roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch. What do you mean with "getting an openni patch"? Are you installing those drivers from git before indigo's openni packages?
Comment by Kongaloosh on 2014-11-29:
@lokus, That's where you should be getting them. As far as I know, openni actually doesn't support the Kinect. The patch which I linked to fixes this. I didn't have to remove and re-install anything, I just downloaded it alongside my existing stack.
Comment by kaygudo on 2015-12-16:
hey can you plz tell me how can i download and use "https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect" or openni patch" on ros? i am new to linux and ros and i am facing the same above mentioned problem for kinect.
