As mentioned by @mwise_wg and @Stefan Kohlbrecher the 3D data is downsampled to 2D data.  Please don't ask follow up questions in "answers" to this question.  This is a directed question and answer not a forum.  If you have a new follow up question, please pose it as it's own question.

But it is most likely 2D navigation , so why TurtleBot uses kinect which is RGB-D scanner??
