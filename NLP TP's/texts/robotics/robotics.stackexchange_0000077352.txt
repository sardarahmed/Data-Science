Q:

MoveIt visualization of planned trajectories with attached objects

I have an application where being able to visualize the trajectory before executing is beneficial for a number of reasons.  I recently added attached collision objects to the robot but they don't seem to show up in the trajectories visualized using move_group's /move_group/display_planned_path topic.  Is this the intended behavior?  If so, does anyone have suggestions on how to elegantly achieve what I am trying to get?

A:

There exists an issue for this in the moveit repository: https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/190
Although this is talking about the visualized trail, the underlying issue is the same.
So, currently the attached objects are not visualized there, but a patch to change that is welcome upstream!

Thanks for the pointer v4hn.  I'll see if I can't find some time to implement this...
