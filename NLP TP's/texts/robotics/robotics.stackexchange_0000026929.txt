Q:

Problem when to try to load to Atlas using Gazebo 2.0

When to try to insert Atlas from Gazebo get this error:
Error [parser_urdf.cc:2608] Unable to call parseURDF on robot model
Error [parser.cc:273] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
Error [ModelMaker.cc:126] Unable to load file[/opt/ros/groovy/share/drcsim_model_resources/gazebo_models/environments/atlas_description/dummy.urdf]

And have problems when try to load from terminal using:
VRC_CHEATS_ENABLED=1 roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch

getting this error:
 [atlas.launch] is neither a launch file in package [atlas_utils] nor is [atlas_utils] a launch file name

A:

The roslaunch command changed in the latest versions and now is:

roslaunch drcsim_gazebo atlas.launch

Probably you have read an outdated documentation, could you please point me to it?
Thanks.

You are right, they should be updated to version 3.3.1, thanks for the information.
