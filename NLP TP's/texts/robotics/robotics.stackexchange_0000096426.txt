Q:

How to find the number of Occupied grids in RTAB-Map global map?

Is there a way to get the total number of grids and the number of occupied grids from the final global map in RTAB-Map?
In the RTAB-Map code there are variables that can list these numbers for each local map, however I need these numbers for the final global map.
PS: I am using ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 VM. RTAB-Map version: 0.19.6
Best regards,
Malar.

A:

If you subscribe to /rtabmap/grid message, you could count each cell of each type directly.
