Q:

hydro's desktop-full

Heya,
I'm trying to build the full ros-hydro system according to the instructions in the wiki.
When I try to run the rosinstall_generator for desktop-full:
$ rosinstall_generator desktop-full --rosdistro hydro --deps

this only tells me:

The following not released packages/stacks will be ignored: desktop-full
No packages/stacks left after ignoring not released

Why is desktop-full not released (yet?)?

A:

All variants have been replaced with metapackages in Hydro. Therefore they now do follow the ROS naming conventions which uses underscores instead of hyphen.
The following command works for me:
$ rosinstall_generator desktop_full --rosdistro hydro --deps

This solved my problem when I was trying to upgrade to hydra, thank you.  Could someone possibly edit the install page of the wiki to reflect this?

I have updated the wiki page. Please feel free to make changes to the wiki yourself in the future if you are sure about the modifications.
