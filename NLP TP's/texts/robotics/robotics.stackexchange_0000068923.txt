Q:

Export URDF from STL

Hi,
Id like to know if its possible to export a working URDF of a ground vehicle from a complete STL file. ??
Can i know How?. I do not have the individual parts of the complete robot.Just a complete stl file.
Thanks,

A:

Working? Sure.
Have it (I assume the Solidworks to URDF exporter plugni) automagically add joints and separate your STL into different parts: no.
You'll have to either find a proper model of your vehicle and use that as a base, or cut up the mesh you have now and manually add the mates/joints. After that, you can export it to a URDF.
