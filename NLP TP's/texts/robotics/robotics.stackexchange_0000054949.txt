Q:

create 3D map with octomap

Hi all,
I want to create a 3d map from environment with simulated kinect. i know that i should use from octomap, i want to get data of kinect and every where that yellow color is available,  set probability for it +1 and other places -1, any one can give me some hints or explain for me what should i do?
Thank you.

I am not able to understand much of your question, but one thing that seems strange is that you set probabilities to 1 and -1. First, a probability can never be negative and second, an octomap cell can never have probability 1 as far as I know. Try the defaults of 0.85 for occupied and 0.4 for free

Yes, you are right, i didn't consider this fact about probability. you know now i got data from simulated kinect and i can find yellow color, but i can't understand how can i use from octomap to create a 3d occupency grid map, in simple word i have technical problem and also i couldn't find any example in internet, i read this link http://octomap.sourceforge.net/doxygen/index.html, but i need a example or some hints to do next part, if you have any experience about it please give me some hints.

have you seen that there is an octomap rospackage:
http://wiki.ros.org/octomap_server
i think you should start with this. if you need to customize the code, this could be helpful:

Thank you, yes i should customize the code. but i can't find a step by step tutorial about this. by the way now i am starting to reading code. also my ros is hydro but i don't have octomap_server package, also i checked in computer of one of my friends also he didn't have this package.

Check here for octomap_server in hydro: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/octomap/kag-AqV6fYs/Jq3SG9cq32EJ
