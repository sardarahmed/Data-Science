Q:

trac-ik lib is not loding

I try to install trac-ik to moveit by using apt-get in ubuntu 16.04, kinetic version. However I don't know why when I start the demo of the moveit, it keeps give me the error of:
The kinematics plugin (arm) failed to load. Error: Failed to load library /opt/ros/kinetic/lib//libtrac_ik_kinematics_plugin.so. Make sure that you are calling the PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro in the library code, and that names are consistent between this macro and your XML. Error string: Could not load library (Poco exception = libmoveit_kinematics_base.so.0.9.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)

when I look at the path /opt/ros/kinetic/lib//libtrac_ik_kinematics_plugin.so. has an addition / in  lib//libtrac_ik_kinematics_plugin.so.
I tried to delete trac_ik and install again but it still the same. It's really wired, It's all install automatically. Could someone tell me where I can modify to make this path correct? Thanks so much.

My colleague doing the same installation of trac-ik but not any problems... I do believe if I reinstall the system may fix this but there was a lot thing in my computer at the moment, I won't be able to that. How can fix this issues without reinstall the system?

A:

I had the same error after installing trac_ik, solved it by:

Upgrade

sudo apt-get upgrade

Delete devel and build
Rebuild your workspace

catkin_make
