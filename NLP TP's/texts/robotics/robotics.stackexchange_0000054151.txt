but when i run this command given in the totorial. http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch it gives error:
$rosdep install joint_state_publisher

please find link of my tutorial in above comment

A:

The issue is that you need joint_state_publisher downloaded already. From the paragraph preceeding the command you ran:
In these tutorials, weâ€™re going to rely on some tools and launch files from the urdf_tools package. Most notably, joint_state_publisher needs to be downloaded from the Washington University repository, linked to on the joint_state_publisher wiki page. All of the robot models mentioned in this tutorial can be found in the urdf_tutorial package.

Thanks for your reply. Actually I am new to ROS. I read this line but could not understand how to install joint_space_publicher.  Could you please guide me how to do that?

You can find that in the 8th ROS tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_a_workspace  I suggest you go through all these tutorials before moving onto specific package tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials
