Q:

No devices connected

Hello!
I'm trying to connect my laptop to Kinect. After running roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch I get the following message: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected.
I know this question has been asked many times, but I've tried all of the advice I found here and am running out of ideas. When I run killall  XnSensorServer I get no such process found and when I run XnSensorServer I get XnSensorServer: error while loading shared libraries: libOpenNI.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64. Could this be the issue? How can I fix it?
Best regards, Elizaveta

The error about ELF class could certainly be contributing to your problem. It looks like you have a 64 bit version of libOpenNI.so, but your computer is a 32 bit machine. Did you install the libopenni0 package from apt-get? If so, it could be that your sources are setup wrong.
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2015-02-10:
Please edit your question and add the output of apt-cache policy libopenni0 and ldd /usr/lib/libopenni-sensor-primesense0/XnSensorServer and uname -a
Comment by Elizaveta.Elagina on 2015-02-12:
I guess I have installed it from apt-get. If this is the problem, how do I change my sources setup? Thanks in advance!
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2015-02-17:
Interestingly, the output of uname -a suggests you have a 64-bit machine, and your apt-cache policy command suggests that your sources are setup correctly. Let's try re-installing all of your openni packages from apt-get in case you've accidently installed some conflicting files without apt-get
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2015-02-17:
I just used the following command to accomplish this reinstall dpkg-query --list |grep openni |awk '{print $2}' | xargs -d "\n" sudo apt-get install --reinstall -y
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2015-02-17:
As another option, you could try using freenect_launch to run your Kinect instead of openni_launch
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2015-02-23:
Those errors would be better presented by editing your original question. You have some conflicting packages; this could mean that you have installed openni packages from multiple places. You could also be running into issues that are documented: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/issues/171
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2015-02-23:
When I run into package conflicts, I often turn towards aptitude instead of apt-get it is better at presenting solutions to these types of conflicts. Did you ever try freenect_launch?
Comment by destogl on 2015-02-26:
How did you install packages? You should not install libopenni0 with apt-get but just ros-indigo-openni-launch and you will automatically get all dependencies...
Comment by Elizaveta.Elagina on 2015-02-27:
freenect_launch works and I can get image from the camera, so that's great, thank you, Jarvis. But I would like to use kinect for building a map and I was hoping to use gmapping. When I run roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch I get the same error about no devices connected.
Comment by destogl on 2015-02-27:
Than you have to change/write your own launch file where you will start freenect_launch and remap topics properly...
Comment by Elizaveta.Elagina on 2015-03-02:
Do you mean that I should change slam_gmapping_pr2.launch in gmapping package? Sorry, I'm a novice in this. How do I start freenect_launch in the launch file?
Comment by destogl on 2015-03-02:
The best is to create your own package with lunch files. Everything about that is here: http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch
Comment by Elizaveta.Elagina on 2015-03-04:
Thnak you, I will try this.

A:

For anyone else that has this issue...
Go to: http://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/01/8/
Scroll down to "Troubleshooting".  From there make sure you following the instructions on:

Installing the driver
Disable USB 3.0 via the BIOS (a little farther down the page)

This will fix most of the problems related to Kinect not working.

She definitely has package conflicts, and errors related to system architecture. The posted resource is excellent, but I'd be surprised if disabling USB 3.0 would fix any issues.
Comment by Mark Silliman on 2015-03-05:
Thanks Jarvis.  We had a newer laptop with the identical error msg.  BIOS fixed it because the Kinect is incompatible with most 3.0 USBs as well as many newer 2.0 USBs which are compatible with 3.0.   The trick that the BIOS does is it effectively downgrades them all so the Kinect can work.
