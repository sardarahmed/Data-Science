Q:

What is a depth image?

What is a depth image? Does it require a special hardware? Can I get depth image from an inbuilt webcam?

A:

In the depth image each pixel value indicates a distance from the sensor. You cannot obtain this from an ordinary Webcam. Special Hardware is required, e.g. Kinect, Laser scanner or Stereo camera.

Thank you for your answer. So, you're saying in here I make no sense? So can I draw your attention to the question in the link? Where should I start and what would I need to make it?
