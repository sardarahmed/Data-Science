Q:

Gazebo9 - ROS Kinetic - packages?

Hey there,
since 25.01.2018 Gazebo9 is available. Anyone of you installed it yet and used it with ROS-Kinetic?
Currently I am not able to use it.... I get this error: Ressource not found gazebo_ros
It seems like the ROS-Kinetic packages for gazebo9 are not available yet:

Greetings
Markus

A:

Update 2018-02-15: packages for Gazebo 9 are now available (discourse announcement).

The default version of Gazebo will always remain 7 for ROS Kinetic, as per REP-3.
If you want to install a different version of Gazebo, you may follow the Which combination of ROS/Gazebo versions to use tutorial on the gazebosim.org site. It's a bit hidden, but the procedure is basically:

add packages.osrfoundation.org repository
install ros-kinetic-gazebo9-ros-pkgs

I'm not sure the OSRF repository already contains packages for Gazebo 9 though.
Note that you may run into issues with packages that expect/require Gazebo 7 (ie: Kinetics default version).

An alternative could be to use one of the available docker images.

Well I guess: the current problem is: ros-kinetic-gazebo9-ros-pkgs are not available yet!
