Q:

How to make ReIn with Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick)?

Hello,
the Recognition Infrastructure does not compile with Maverick (see its ROS_BUILD_BLACKLIST file).
The problem is that soci.h is (strangely) not found by cmake.
Is there any action going on to solve this issue at the moment?
I see some people are actively using some of the packages contained in the object_recognition stack. Could they explain how to do so using maverick?
I feel I am asking something stupid here, but I really can't figure out how to solve that cmake problem and use this stack. Any hint is welcome.
Thanks in advance
Raph
