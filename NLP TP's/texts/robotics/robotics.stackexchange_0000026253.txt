A:

I don't know what the optirun command does to set the DISPLAY env variable.. but on my machine, when I don't set the DISPLAY variable to something useful I get the message
X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  146 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  5 (X_GLXMakeCurrent)
  Serial number of failed request:  22
  Current serial number in output stream:  22
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

for reference, your error messages was slightly different from mine..
X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  72 (X_PutImage)
  Serial number of failed request:  38
  Current serial number in output stream:  40
Error [Transport.cc:102] Unable to get topic namespaces in [50] tries.
Error [Node.cc:68] No namespace found

To fix my problem, I run xvfb (can be run in the background or in another terminal)

Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24

and then run gazebo

DISPLAY=:1 rosrun gazebo gazebo
my.world

If there was a display already open on the machine that I had access to (e.g. if I was physically logged in through a GUI or something), I could have also set the variable to that value as well.

Hello, what type of graphics card are you using and what driver are you using for the card?
Comment by lian on 2013-05-21:
Due to  optimus tech doesn't have linux driver, so I use bumblebee(each execution has to add key word:optirun).

Maybe you could post a question here http://whoochee.blogspot.com/2012/12/optimus-and-discrete-nvidia-gpu-under.html (they claim that "everything works")
