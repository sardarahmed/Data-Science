Q:

Location of move_group_interface for UR5

Hi!
I'm trying to control an UR5 via MoveIt! in Indigo on a Linux Ubuntu 14.04 system.
I did all the tutorials of ROS and Getting-Started with an UR5. And I do find the tutorial for Move Group Interface/C++ API. And there I understand the single points described.
But I do not understand which file exactly I have to change here. Where can I find or where do I have to build this file? Is it somewhere in the catkin-workspace or somewhere in opt/ros/...
Did I miss a tutorial at some point where this is described?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I think, I understand it now. I just can build this file anywhere in the catkin-workspace and just have catkin_make the workspace after changing it.
It's really well explained what's in the file, but in my opinion it misses the information, where this file should be.

Glad you resolved the issue by yourself. Suggestion should be the most welcomed at the repository of the package you used.
