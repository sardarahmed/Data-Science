Q:

interactive marker - processFeedback()

Hi,
I want to have an interactive marker as part of a class that I'm making, but am running into trouble with the processFeedback() as a member function.
I can define it as static void processFeedback() which works but then I need to pass an instance to the function (which I can't seem to figure out how to do).
When I don't make the function static I get a bunch of boost errors and no match for call to .... error.
How do I either pass the static function an instance or how do I define the function so that I don't have to use static?

A:

Guess I should learn boost... although I only found this in a random post. Not sure what's really going on.
menu_handler.insert("menu item", boost::bind(&MyClass::processFeedback, this, _1));
