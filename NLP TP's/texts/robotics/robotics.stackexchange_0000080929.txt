Q:

How to change different topics pace in rosbag?

I have 2 topics (A and B) in rosbag. but they are not synchrinized, A is 10s ahead of B. So I want to create a new rosbag and make A 10s delay to synchronize with B.
How should I do that ?
should I change the header.stamp to make it?

You can use the rosbag API to recreate your bag file with new stamps.
