Q:

slam_gmapping tutorial

I am working through the Robot Setup of the Navigation Tutorial and the slam_gmapping tutorial.
I have downloaded the bagfile and ran slam_gmapping.  I did not run the whole bagfile, because it was so long.
When I run map_saver, I get the following:
Waiting for the map

How do I get around this?
Thanks.

slam_gmapping must still be running when you run the map_saver.
