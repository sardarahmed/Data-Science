Did you intend to check out the Groovy version of gazebo to build on Fuerte?

What version of ogre do you have? Did you run rosdep install simulator_gazebo?

A:

You did not mention what OS you are running.
On Ubuntu Precise, I have OGRE 1.7.4-3, which seems to work fine:
$ dpkg -s libogre-dev
Package: libogre-dev
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: libdevel
Installed-Size: 6044
Maintainer: Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>
Architecture: amd64
Source: ogre
Version: 1.7.4-3
Depends: libogre-1.7.4 (= 1.7.4-3), libboost-date-time-dev, libboost-thread-dev, libfreeimage-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libzzip-dev, libxaw7-dev
Suggests: ogre-doc
Description: 3D Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine (development files)
 OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible
 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for
 developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D
 graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying
 system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on
 world objects and other intuitive classes.
 .
 This package contains the headers needed to develop with OGRE.
Original-Maintainer: Debian Games Team <pkg-games-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>

Perhaps you just need to install that package.
