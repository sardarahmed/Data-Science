A:

The development of some new functionality is done in an internal repository of the IAS group. Once the code has reached a certain level of maturity, it is synchronized with the public repositories. Since the code in the development repository is not as stable as that in the public one, it is recommended to use the public code repository at http://code.in.tum.de/pubsvn/knowrob/tags/latest (as described at http://www.ros.org/wiki/knowrob)
