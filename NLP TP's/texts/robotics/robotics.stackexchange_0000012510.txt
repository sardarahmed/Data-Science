Q:

Robots with less than 6 degrees of freedom

Is there any possibility to have a robot with less than six degrees of freedom & still be able to achieve any position & orientation around end effector?

A:

Short answer: No.
Long answer: In how many dimensions you are defining 'any'?
The best way to understand it is actually through math.
Let's say you have a desired position $$p=\left[\begin{matrix}x\\y\\z\end{matrix}\right]$$ and an orientation $$\omega=\left[\begin{matrix}\chi\\\psi\\\zeta\end{matrix}\right]$$ in three dimensions. 
Now let's say we have a robot with six degrees of freedom $$Q=\left[\begin{matrix}q1\\q2\\q3\\q4\\q5\\q6\end{matrix}\right]$$.
Assuming you know your position and orientation you are trying to find your joint angles. This can be written in matrix form.
$$\left[\begin{matrix}q1\\q2\\q3\\q4\\q5\\q6\end{matrix}\right]= F\left[\begin{matrix}x\\y\\z\\\chi\\\psi\\\zeta\end{matrix}\right]$$.
Where F a 6x6 matrix with your inverse kinematics functions. 
Notice how you have 6 knowns (your position and orientation) and six unknown (your joint angles). 
Basically you have a 6-by-6 system to solve. If you have fewer degrees of freedom then you have fewer unknowns which means that you can't solve independently. Meaning your position and orientation are linearly dependent.
For example changing your position $x$, will change your $\chi$ or your $\psi$ or even your $y$. Imagine trying to move a glass of water in a straight line and suddenly the glass turns over and then back again. 
So think a robot with less than six degrees of freedom as a robot that you can't control its behavior at any time rather than a robot that can't reach a certain position at any time.
Now if you have a task that does not require to move along and rotate around an axis (e.g. $z$ & $\zeta$) then you can ignore them and now you have a 4-by-4 system to worry about. Therefore, for this 2D task, a robot with four degrees of freedom can achieve 'any' position and orientation. Similarly, if you put a constraint on the force along the $x$ direction, you now have an $F_x$ variable that entered your system making it a 7-by-7 system that requires seven degrees of freedom to achieve 'any' position and orientation.
Generally, 6 degrees of freedom is the standard robot because it can control its end effector along each dimension independently. Any fewer degrees of freedom can still be useful in some more limited tasks. Higher degrees of freedom can tackle more complicated tasks, though in those case there is a selection whether all parameters will be satisfied independently or no. 
The bottom line is, for general cases in a 3D environment you need 6 degrees of freedom. 
I tried to keep my answer short without using too much math but let me know if you are still unsure about the effect the number of degrees of freedom have on the position and orientation of the end effector.
