Q:

FlexBe Unable to import temporary behavior file

I'm trying to follow this tutorial link text
when i run the behaviour i get this error

Unable to import temporary behavior file:
No module named src.flexbe_states.log_state

I have set up a home directory as per the instructions, when i compared the file i created following the tutorial  to the installed example
this is my result
from flexbe_states.src.flexbe_states.log_state import LogState
from flexbe_states.src.flexbe_states.wait_state import WaitState

this is from the installed example
from flexbe_states.log_state import LogState
from flexbe_states.wait_state import WaitState

when edit my file it this it works but as soon as i edit my behaviour it goes back.
i have configured states to
~/catkin_ws/src/flexbe_behavior_engine/flexbe_states
Im running
Ubuntu 14.4 64 bit
ROS indigo installed from debs
on a ASUS k53s I7  with 8 gis of ram
on a fresh install and update

A:

Hey,
this results from the FlexBE App configuration. As you wrote, you added ~/catkin_ws/src/flexbe_behavior_engine/flexbe_states to the "State Library" panel.
Correct would be in this case: ~/catkin_ws/src/flexbe_behavior_engine/flexbe_states/src/flexbe_states
(see installation guidelines on the homepage: "Make sure to add the folder which contains the states, not the ROS package itself (i.e. ... /flexbe_behavior_engine/flexbe_states/src/flexbe_states)".
I guess I need to make it more obvious, sorry! Or just make it also work this way. Just ask if there are further problems and thank you for trying FlexBE. :)

Thank you for the quick response it works now

I just pushed an update. Your first configuration would now work as well and even simply passing ~/catkin_ws/src in order to use all states inside your workspace is possible.
