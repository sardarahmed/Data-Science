Q:

Creating Second Workspace

I have a workspace called "catkin_ws" in my home directory. I built the workspace with the command catkin_make and  I added two extra lines to .bashrc file:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Then, I created second workspace called "catkin_ws2" in my home directory and built it by using the command catkin_make. Finally, I decided to delete second workspace by using the command catkin clean. However, when I try to delete it with that command, the message current or desired workspace could not be determined is displayed.
Why cannot I delete it ? (Note: I execute catkin clean in the directory ~/catkin_ws2)
My opinion: Since I did not source setup.bash file of second workspace, catkin build tool does not know such a workspace exists.Hence, the command does not work.
