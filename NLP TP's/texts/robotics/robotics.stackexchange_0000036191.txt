Q:

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'main'

I installed ROS via the instructions on installing on Mac OSX with no errors during installation. I need ROS to work with Python 3.2.2 (it needs to integrate with MORSE and therefore with Blender, and they both use 3.2.2), so I fixed all of the generic print statements needing parentheses, but then I get to this error. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, as well as the ever typical rebooting, and it is still not fixed.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/Users/o2wtf2o/ros/ros/bin/roscore", line 36, in 
roslaunch.main(['roscore', '--core']+sys.argv[1:])
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'main'

FYI: you still need to run the ROS command-line tools with Python 2.  The MORSE/Blender fixes only apply the the underlying communication libraries.  Thus, run MORSE with Py3k, run ROS with Python 2.
