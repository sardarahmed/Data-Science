A:

Instead of getting the source code and building it by yourself, you can download the binaries i.e. hector_slam package itself for your ROS distribution. You can use command

sudo apt-get install ros-your_ros_dist_name-hector-slam

for eg. in case of ros indigo you can use command

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-hector-slam

this will download and install all the necessary packages for hector slam.

then follow this tutorial setting your robot. For example you can check this project hector_slam_example. In hector_hokuyo.launch file, replace hokuyo part by kinect.

If you just want to check hector slam you can follow this tutorial. After installing binaries you don't need to modify anything. You can straightaway use it.
