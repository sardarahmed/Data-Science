Q:

Can't visualize RaySensor in Gazebo 1.5

Hi all,
I'm working through the tutorials with the aim of learning to write my own ROS plugins to control models.
In the Control Model tutorial, the example has true for the ray sensor. However, I can't see the ray when I load the world file. Does this happen for everyone?
Also: part 2 of my question on the tutorial is here.

A:

Make sure you use the correct tutorials. Your link goes to a Gazebo 1.3 tutorial, but the title of this question is for Gazebo 1.5.
Also, make sure that <always_on> is set to true. Otherwise the laser will be disabled until someone, such as ROS, subscribes to the laser data.

I'm not sure what's changed -- but I've gone through, copied from the 1.5 tutorial, and it seems to work.  I think I was using the 1.3 tutorial because the 1.3 set had some stuff the 1.5 set didn't yet have.

Also, thanks for the inspiration -- in checking out the <always_on> tags in the sdf documentation, I found out about the <update_rate> tags which allowed me to solve this: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/2086/has-anybody-gotten-the-contact-sensor-example-to/?answer=2303#post-id-2303 problem.
