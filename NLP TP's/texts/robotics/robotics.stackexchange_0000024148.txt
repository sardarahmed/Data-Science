Q:

robotic arm controlled by mouse

I want to create a webot simulation for robotic arm. The entire arm should be controlled by the mouse. Is it possible to implement in webots?

A:

In Webots there is the mouse node, with this you can capture the mouse events, but only the events that happen in the 3D window.
