Q:

Is it possible to perform inverse kinematics using MoveIt! plugin without defining dynamic parameters at urdf file?

Given that (in theory) kinematics (forward o inverse) doesn't care about dynamic parameters such as mass or inertial matrix /Ixx, Izxy, etc.( related to links and so on. Can I perform inverse kinematics using move it! plugin in Rviz without defining dynamic parameters in the URDF file?

A:

The URDF format doesn't require the dynamic parameters to be specified (see here).  If you already have a moveit_config package created with the moveit setup assistant from the URDF then you can run the "move_group.launch" file there which provides a number of services.  One such service is the "/compute_ik" which returns a joint solution for your robot.
