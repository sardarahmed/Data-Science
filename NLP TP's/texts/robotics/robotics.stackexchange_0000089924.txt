Q:

[rospack] Error: package 'turtlebot3_description' not found

I'm following the steps from the Robotis e-Manual website
http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/
Currently:

I'm running roscore on remote pc.
I'm running roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch  on turtlebot pc.

But every time I run the command below on the remote pc:
 rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_description`/rviz/model.rviz  

I get is error:
[rospack] Error: package 'turtlebot3_description' not found
[ INFO] [1545426118.806539706]: rviz version 1.13.1

libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile

After I get this message,a window with the title model.rivz* -VZiz and it's suppose to display the robot and it doesn't. Also I get a global status error.
How do I fix this??

A:

I've found a solution for this. After you have installed ROS, you need to create a ROS workspace and setup a bash.
Immediately you need to make sure your workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script, make sure ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable includes the directory you're in.
Follow this website, step 3 for instruction--  http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
