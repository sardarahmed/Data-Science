Q:

running image_view with pointgrey flea3 camera

Hello,
I installed the driver for two Flea3 Pointgrey cameras whose accessibility are (successfully) verified via:

rosrun pointgrey_camera_driver list_cameras

12062824
12062828
Now "starting" one of those cameras with

roslaunch pointgrey_camera_driver camera.launch camera_serial:=12062824

I would like to display my images with

rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image

but I receive the following error code:

[ERROR] [1404221648.972130708]: Client
[/image_view_1404220593387350082]
wants topic /camera/image to have
datatype/md5sum
[sensor_msgs/Image/060021388200f6f0f447d0fcd9c64743],
but our version has
[wfov_camera_msgs/WFOVImage/807d0db423ab5e1561cfeba09a10bc88].
Dropping connection. [ERROR]
[1404221696.898906591]: Client

wants topic /camera/image to have

[sensor_msgs/Image/060021388200f6f0f447d0fcd9c64743],
but our version has
[wfov_camera_msgs/WFOVImage/807d0db423ab5e1561cfeba09a10bc88].
Dropping connection.

It seems like the camera.launch script publishes the images in a message format which is not known to
image_view.
As I am a beginner to Linux as well as ROS I would like to ask for some tips how to publish
my images (or edit camera.launch) in a certain way, eg. under the topic "left_camera/image".
Also how would I take a first step in displaying my images from the camera?
Thank you!

Can I Know how did you resolve this issue ?

A:

When you go to run image_view, you have to view the "raw" image format using rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw.
Let me know if this works and if you are able to view both at once. I'm having issues attempting to view both streams simultaneously at the moment.

Hi, when I run the above command, a blank window opens up. I am able to get some data when I run 'rostopic echo /camera/image' but not able to view it using image_view. What could it be that am doing wrong?
