Q:

rosjava CallerID in MessageListener

Is there a simple way to get a publisher's callerID within a Subscriber/Message Listener in rosjava? I see that it gets stored in the publisher while in TcpServerHandshakeHandler.java:handleSubscriberHandshake() but do not see the subscriber having access to this.
Thanks,
Steve
