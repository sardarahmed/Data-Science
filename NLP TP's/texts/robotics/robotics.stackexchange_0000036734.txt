Q:

Download a package with rosmake

Hi,
I created a stack which includes one teleop package. this package uses the library Qt and depends on the stack eros to build it.
In the current state, before building my package, I need to install the eros stack by following the installation instruction: http://www.ros.org/wiki/eros/Installation
I included the necessary eros_build package as a depend in my manifest.xml, but that doesn't download and install this package or even the eros stack.
My question would be, is there a way to automatize the download of the eros stack while executing rosmake in my package, if the stack wasn't found?
Thank you for your help.

A:

rosmake is not designed to download and build packages.  It only does the building part.
I suggest that you look at using rosinstall to install your packages.
