Q:

rqt_ on a remote machine?

I am running roscore and a couple of nodes and dynamic parameter servers on machine A.
I want to modify the parameters from machine B by rqt_reconfigure (ROS and rqt packages are installed on this machine) . How can I do this?

A:

1- On both machines: connect to the same network.
2- On machine B: set the environment variable
export ROS_MASTER_URI = http://machineA-hostname:11311

3- Run the rqt_stuff as usual.

Glad you got it solved. Note that connecting remote ROS Masters can be problematic, so you might want to go through Networking in addition.

Thanks! It's working fine for now but I think using ROS on a network with multiple machines could use more tutorials on wiki.

You're welcomed to contribute to making such a tutorial then!
