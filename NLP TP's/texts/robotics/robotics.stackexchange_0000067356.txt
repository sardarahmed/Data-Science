It did work after opening the terminal again. Maybe because the environment variable wasn't loaded.

A:

It asks for a world file, so give it a world file. Something like
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch world_file:=/opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds/playground.world

This MAY work for now, but you should really stick to the way the package developers support. See the link in my answer.
