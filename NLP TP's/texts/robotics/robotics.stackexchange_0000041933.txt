Q:

Remove/rename package Wiki page

Hello everyone,
last week I published some ROS packages into an indexed repo and started working on the Wiki pages.
After I finished with all the package documentation it turned out that I have to rename the package and do some refactoring (not my idea of course) so I did all the necessary software modifications but what about the wiki pages and tutorials I created?
My primary solution was to create new pages and add the sources from the old ones after a bit of refactoring.
The question is: is there a more appropriate way to do this?
Also how can I remove the "deprecated" wiki pages?
Thanks in advance.
