Q:

Does create_autonomy roomba driver package support ROS_Hydro?

Does create_autonomy driver package support ROS_Hydro?
I'm pleased to see the lasted driver for iRobot_ROOMBA, does this support ROS_Hydro?
If so, Do I need to modify/configure something before compile it for my ROS hydro distribution?

A:

create_autonomy does not officially support Hydro. That being said, nothing comes to mind that should stop you from building and running the driver. I believe all of the dependencies have Hydro equivalents. I'd be interested to know what (if any) problems you have if you try to build the driver for Hydro.
