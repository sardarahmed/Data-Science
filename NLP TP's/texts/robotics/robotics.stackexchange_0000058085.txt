Q:

Webots to URDF Model Converter

Is there any existing work out there on a converter that allows generating URDF from Webots models? IÂ´d be interested in anything useful for that task (also partial implementations, hints, etc.).

A:

Webots now can export URDF files. You can right-click on a robot, click Export, and save it as your_robot_name.urdf. Or, you can use the wb_robot_get_urdf API function:
