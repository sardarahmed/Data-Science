Q:

unable to install ros kinetic in ubuntu 16.04

I am trying to install ros kinetic kame in ubuntu 16.04 , but after trying the first step setup your sources. list. 
I am getting  cannot create /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list: Permission denied what to do now

A:

I understand that the problem was when running this command in the terminal:

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

Could it be you forgot to run it with sudo?
