Q:

ros-jade-desktop-full and ros-kinetic-desktop-full are out of reach

I installed those packages dozen of times.... Yesterday, I had to install a new machine and got:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-desktop-full

Is there a problem somewhere?

A:

Well .. which OS are you running, and more specifically, which version?
ROS Jade packages are basically only available for Ubuntu Trusty (14.04), not for Xenial (16.04) or anything later.
ROS Kinetic is available only on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) .
See also REP-003 (the REP still states that 14.10, 15.04 and 15.10 are also supported, but afaik no packages are being built for those distributions any more.
