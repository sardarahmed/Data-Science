Q:

Tools bar missing from rviz on Mac OS X

Hi everyone!
I've just noticed that my rviz is not showing the Tools bar, this is the bar on the top that has buttons for moving the camera, selecting, setting goals, etc.
I installed ros electric using the homebrew tutorial. My Mac OS X version is 10.7.3. Rviz compiled just fine, though I do get some warnings at the rviz startup.
Does anyone else have this problem? Any ideas on how to get the Tools bar?

A:

Not really an answer, more of an alternative, I still cannot see the Toolbar with the buttons on my rviz on Mac OS X, however I did find out that the keyboard shortcuts work!!!
So if I want to set a goal I can just press g on the keyboard, if I want to set the robot pose I can press p, etc...
