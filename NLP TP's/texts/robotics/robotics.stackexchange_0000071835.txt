Q:

RGBDSLAM alternatives for Indigo

Hello everyone,
I've been assigned a project in which the robot has to generate the environment map and locate itself in it, all with a Kinect.
The problem is that I've found only solutions involving the Fuerte-based rgbdslam library (for instance, this one) while I'm using Indigo.
Is there any alternative I can use with Indigo?
I know there's a rgbdslam_v2 for Hydro which seems can be used in Indigo, but I was wondering if are there more reliable solutions.
TIA

Hello,
RGBDSLAM works now with indigo. I used it a little (I don't know if all works) but it works for what I have done.
You can go to https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2 and select Branch indigo.
Hope this helps

Thanks for your reply. In the meantime, I found out rtabmap_ros, what do you think about it as alternative?

Actually I'm using RTAB-Map, and it works really fine out of the box. It's very configurable according your needs.
