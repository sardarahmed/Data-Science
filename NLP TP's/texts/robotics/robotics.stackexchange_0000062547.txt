A:

The topic you are looking for is the depth/image_rect topic published by the openni stack, which you start via openni_launch (if you're using the kinect). This will be a rectified 2D image, with the intensity of the pixel representing the depth at that point.
As for displaying the image, try taking a look at the image_view node.

If you're having issues installing openni, I'd suggest you open a new question, with some debug output to boot.
