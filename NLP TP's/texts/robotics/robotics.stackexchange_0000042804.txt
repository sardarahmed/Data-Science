Q:

Installing rosjava_messages fails missing class CircularBlockingDeque

Hi everyone,
I was trying to set up a new rosjava environment on Ubuntu 11.04 and ROS electric following the build guide. Building rosjava_messages fails as org.ros.concurrent.EventDispatcher.java (and others are missing) class org.ros.concurrent.CircularBlockingDequeue.
> Building > :rosjava_messages:compileJava > Resolving dependencies     
':rosjava_me:rosjava_messages:compileJava
:rosjava_messages:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:rosjava_messages:classes
:rosjava_messages:jar
:rosjava:compileJava       
/home/andreas/workspace/rosjava_core/rosjava/src/main/java/org/ros/concurrent/EventDispatcher.java:29: cannot find symbol
symbol  : class CircularBlockingDeque
location: class org.ros.concurrent.EventDispatcher<T> private final CircularBlockingDeque<SignalRunnable<T>> events;

Interestingly org.ros.concurrent.CircularBlockingQueue is there.
Could somebody please deploy CircularBlockingDequeue?
Thank you!
Best regards,
Andreas

Damons answer  - which I can't comment on Chrome 20.0.1132.47 right now - was correct. Updating rosjava ("rosws remove rosjava_core" etc.) fixed this.

A:

I believe your clone is out of date. Pull and update.
