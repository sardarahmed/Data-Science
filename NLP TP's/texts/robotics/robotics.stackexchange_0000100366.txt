Q:

Is there a ros1 package like demo_nodes_cpp from ros2?

I just need a simple talker/listener pair to use for demo purposes. Yes I could roll my own, but for testing connectivity a standard package is a little easier.

For future readers: you can install it using apt install ros-noetic-roscpp-tutorials.
Similar for rospy: ros-noetic-rospy-tutorials.
And you could even opt to just use rostopic pub and rostopic echo.
