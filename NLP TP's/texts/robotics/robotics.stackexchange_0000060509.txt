Q:

Should we add r_upper_arm_joint and r_forearm_joint on planning group?

I follow Moveit Setup_Assistant tutorial.
In doc has this picture:

But the below it also say that r_upper_arm_joint and r_forearm_joint are fixed joint and will not be used for planning or kinematics.
So, should we add these two joint on right arm planning group?
If not, when I added what problem I will met?
Thank you~

A:

In theory, it shouldn't cause any difference. In practice, in the past there have been issues/bugs when dealing with different group representations. When defining a group with a set of joints, it is probably best to use only the active joints, and skip the fixed joints.
The alternative is to define the group as a chain, by selecting a starting link ( say torso_lift_link) and an ending link (ex: l_wrist_roll_link), however, there have definitely been issues in the past with the kinematic chain representation, and I think the recommendation at this point in time is to use the active joint representation you are already using.
