when doing
wstool init -j4 ~/android/src https://raw.github.com/rosjava/rosjava/hydro/android_core.rosinstall

i get the error

A:

It could be that you're just hitting a transient network error. Try again and see if it works now.
Alternatively, there could be something wrong with your network configuration (although unlikely). Try to see whether this succeeds:
$ nslookup raw.github.com

Also make sure you have no http(s) proxy configured anywhere. It might be interfering.

So what was it in the end? Transient error? Proxy?
