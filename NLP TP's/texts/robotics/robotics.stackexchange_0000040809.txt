Q:

make install fails for openni-drivers

Hello
I use Ubuntu 11.04 and I try to communicate to a Kinect sensor (the kinect
is not connected). I followed the instruction  from http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect and  get some problems.
In 1. Install the Openni drivers onto your system
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers
cd drivers
make
make install
after make install  I have got :
sd@sd:~/drivers$ make install
cd openni && make
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/sd/drivers/openni'
cd build/openni/Platform/Linux/CreateRedist && bash RedistMaker && cd -

A:

Does installing the binary package (apt-get install ros-fuerte-openni-kinect) work?
