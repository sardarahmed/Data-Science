Q:

Pixhawk not publishing the local position of my Quadrotor

I am on Ubuntu 14.04 (ROS Indigo). I run "roslaunch mavros px4.launch" and am able to successfully connect to my quadrotor. I have a working GPS signal and also could see the data being published on "/mavros/global_position/local". However, no data is being published on "/mavros/local_position/pose". When I run the gazebo simulation, data is being published on "/mavros/local_position/pose". What could be the possible solution to this?
Thanks in advance

A:

hi! In order to start the internal ekf2 estimator to see any activity on mavros/local_position/pose, you need to thick  the box on the EKF2_AID_MASK (use vision / use yaw fusion)!
hope it can help
