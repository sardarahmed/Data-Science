Q:

How to create an ellipsoid

I would like to create an ellipsoid in Gazebo (and use it as static, and only visual, no collision). Reason for that is that I want to show an object and the minimum-volume ellipsoid enclosing the object. I have the algorithm to calculate the ellipsoid, but I don't know how to spawn it in Gazebo (no problem for a sphere, but I can't find any ellipsoid model). Is there any way to do so ?
I'm using Gazebo7 and ROS Kinetic.

A:

Unfortunately, there isn't yet an ellipsoid primitive in Gazebo. The only way to use one right now would be to create one with a CAD program and export it to a mesh format supported by Gazebo 7 (COLLADA, STL or OBJ).
Here's a tutorial explaining how to import meshes using SDF:

And here's an issue tracking the feature request for ellipsoid support. You could vote for that issue:
