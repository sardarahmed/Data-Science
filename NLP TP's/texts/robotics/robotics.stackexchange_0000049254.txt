Q:

I follow the instruction :
Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise)
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

Set up your keys
   wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-get update

then ,that is this :

Ign http://packages.ros.org precise/main TranslationIndex

A:

Try to remove the lists directory under /var/lib and then creat it again:
cd /var/lib/apt
sudo rm -fr lists
sudo mkdir lists
sudo mkdir lists/partial

And try updating again
sudo apt-get update

After that, follow the instructions under the installation guide again (Configuring repositories, set up the keys updating apt-get and installing)
