Q:

rviz2 dll conflic with zlib1.dll (Windows 10)

I installed ROS 2 humble on Windows and followed all the dependency steps, and tested packages like turtlesim without any problems. However, when I try to use rviz2 by using the command "rviz2" or "ros2 run rviz2 rviz2", it gives me an error message that I need zlib.dll. I downloaded and moved it to the ROS 2 bin folder, but then it prompted me that I also need zlib1.dll. I downloaded it as well and moved it to the same folder, but then it gave me an error message saying that it could not initialize (0xc000007b).
I believe this error occurs due to DLL conflicts, but I am unsure which DLLs are conflicting with rviz2. Has anyone else encountered this error before? And if so, how can it be resolved?

A:

Accidentally, I used the wrong Version of zlib1.dll. Maybe this was the same issue for you @Proxeus.
Extracting zlib-1.2.8-win32-x86_64.7z and adding its location to my PTAH variable fixed it for me.
