Q:

Understanding Parameters - Changing & Using New Value On The Fly

I am new to ROS.  I am using Python 3 and ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04.  I need help understanding parameters.
Currently, I use a launch file to set parameters and in the C++ publisher code I do a getParam
to get the value of the parameter from the Parameter Server.  This works fine.
Now, I want to create a rqt GUI and from the GUI change the value of a parameter, get the new value in the publisher code and act on it, without restarting the Parameter server or publisher.
Can I do this with setParam() and getParam()?  I've read some about dynamic_reconfigure.  Is that what I need to use rather than setParam()/getParam()?
Any help getting me started in the right direction is appreciated!

A:

If you want to change parameters values during the node execution then yes dynamic_reconfigure is what you are looking for. Moreover you have the package rqt_reconfigure creating the GUI for you.
You should check #q175010 comparing server parameters and dynamic reconfigure.

Thanks for the feedback. That is a helpful link to the question comparing server parameters and dynamic reconfigure as I hadn't found that question in my searches.
