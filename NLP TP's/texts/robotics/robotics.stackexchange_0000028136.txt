Q:

How to include uri relatively?

I have built a model to be placed within my project, other than placing it in ~/.gazebo/models (then later be used like model://my_model) in my .world file, could I include like the following or similar: (p.s. the following one seems doesn't work)
<include>
  <uri>model://$(find my_package)/models/my_model.sdf</uri>
</include>

A:

Your .world files are in SDF, and unfortunately SDF doesn't support the kind of substitution you're trying to do. I believe the syntax you're using is supported on ROS launch files.
Gazebo will find your model as long as its parent path is listed on the environment variable GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH. So you can place it on a directory other than ~/.gazebo/models and append that path to the environment variable.

Hooray! After setting GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH as my model path within /etc/environment, Gazebo did find customized models. Although I expect relative uri's are supported built-in. :-P
