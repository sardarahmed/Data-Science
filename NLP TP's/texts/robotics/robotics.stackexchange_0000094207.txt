Q:

TF update slow, Sychronize laptop request time with ROS update time

Currently My TF package update extremely slow.
Error pops up for "Lookup would require extrapolation into the future. Requested time xxxxx but the latest data is at time yyyyyyy."           WaitforTransform does not work.
How should I sychronize my laptop time with the ROS time on the robot?
