Q:

Pose on global_costmap

I set the parameters /move_base/global_costmap/origin_x and /move_base/global_costmap/origin_y -50.0 and -50.0 (width is 100.0), becouse the robot was in angle of global map (parameters were 0.0 and 0.0). But it still have been in angle (the static map from map_server is on picture).
In local costmap the parameters are same. And the robot is in the centre of it.

It is near with odom and base_link frame. There isn't any coordinate system in the centre of offset static map

What I'm saying is that it is displaying in its default pose since the global frame in rviz is not /map. If you change the global frame to map, does it change where the map is displayed?
