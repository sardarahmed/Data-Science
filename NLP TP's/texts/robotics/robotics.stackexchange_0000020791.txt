Q:

Name of imitating motion technique in Robotics

This is my first question here and I'm not into this thing at all.
I recently saw a movie named Pacific Rim and in that I saw a technique in which a robotic arm imitates human arm(in the beginning of the movie). I was wondering what is that technique called and is it ever possible to build giant robots like the ones shown in the movie( Considering we've no shortage of budget).
I'm not into robotics at all so I just thought about asking it here.
Thank You!

A:

This is reference tracking. It's basically the sole point of the entire field of control theory.
Provide a reference input (like the encoder position from a device attached to your arm) and drive the system until the actual output matches the reference input. 
Voltage regulation, cruise control, rocket guidance, autopilot, self-driving cars... nearly everything that has a "behavior" has a target they're trying to achieve.
And for giant robot arms specifically, there is the Hand of Man.
