Q:

How do I start a .launch file from Eclipse IDE

Hi,
I use Eclipse to develop ROS applications and the "cmake eclipse-project" is very helpful for this purpose. But how do I start a .launch file out of this IDE? I made some experiments to define new "External tool configurations" but it does not work :-(
Is there anywhere a guideline or a tutorial for this topic?
Thanks for your help !

No, I haven't figured out how to use launch files in Eclipse. I activate a launch file for all of the external nodes from the command line and just launch the node I am debugging in Eclipse.

I can't answer your question, but perhaps this person can: http://answers.ros.org/question/930/how-to-configure-eclipse-to-properly-load-a-plugin

A:

I take some minutes to find a solution for the problem :

Add a new file association for .launch files

General -> Editors -> File Association ... add a new file type with the suffix *.launch assign the XML Editor to the new file type
General -> Appearance -> Content Types ... roll off entry for TEXT in the menu go to XML and add *.launch

Now a .launch file will be opened by the XML Editor, if you have installed it.

In a second step you have to define a new external tool launch.

Run -> External Tools -> External Tools Configurations
choose PROGRAM and add a new lauch configuration by clicking the left button
write a name like “Launch_ROS” to NAME
integrate the path of roslaunch into LOCATION (usually something like ../ros/ros_comm/tools/roslaunch/bin/roslaunch)
add as ARGUMENTS your ROS package name and .launch file name (for a more general use you can take ${project_name} ${resource_name}, but in this case your focus has to be on your launch file while starting !!!)
then you can start the ROS application by Run -> External Tools -> Launch ROS

Anyone feels free to improve the chain !

I'm trying to run roslaunch or roscore as an External Tool following this guide, but I get an error.
Looks like you probably need to define for eclipse the ROS environment variables, I think I've done so, but then I get this error when running:
/usr/bin/env: python: No such file or directory
Comment by Poseidonius on 2012-09-18:
Eclipse looks for a python interpreter in /usr/bin/env/ ... please check this outside Eclipse. Probably you add a wrong path.
Comment by chcorbato on 2012-09-20:
Outside Eclipse everything works. Could it be that Eclipse overwrites the path to the python interpreter? Maybe because of a default configuration for the PyDev plugin? Do you know which is the variable in Eclipse that defines the path?
Comment by Poseidonius on 2012-09-21:
Take a view on Window > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreter Python ... You can use "Auto Config" or declare the path manually.

Thank you, @Poseidonius! This is really helpful.

Thanks  @Poseidonius,  I am able to run my launch file in eclipse.  I was wondering is there a way I can debug it as well. That will be debugging in eclipse while running an external tool.

I figured out a way of debugging nodes started with a launch config, see my blog post http://www.ceh-photo.de/blog/?p=899

Just had the following error, but found a solution:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/indigo/bin/roslaunch", line 34, in 
import roslaunch
ImportError: No module named roslaunch
Solution: Eclipse has to be launched from command line to have all environment variables.

I'm new with eclipse and was really confused about what should I type in "Working Directory" and "Arguments". Can anyone give me some hints?

I followed the instructions above and got the following error:
31m[demo_backpack_2d.launch] is neither a launch file in package [cartographer_ros] nor is [cartographer_ros] a launch file name[0m
from the shell it launches fine.
what am i missing?
