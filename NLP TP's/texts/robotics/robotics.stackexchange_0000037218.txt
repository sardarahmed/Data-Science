Q:

Does the simulated turtlebot in gazebo require calibration?

Hi,
I would like to know if turtlebot which is simulated in gazebo requires calibration of Odometry and Gyro.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

Calibration is not required, but note in simulation there's numerical errors associated with physics calculation causing the robot odometry to drift a bit as the robot drives around.  The numerical error is associated with the time step size and the inner iteration steps setting if quickstep is used.
