Q:

Queueing positions for the robot to move to

Hi,
I would like to have the robot move to point a->b->c in order and am not sure how to do this using a simple action client. I'm using movebase for this. When I add a second position for the robot to move to then it overwrites the first position. Thus, it looks like I need a way to check what the robot's current position is and if it point a then the robot should move to b and so on. Is this correct? How would I go about implementing this?
Thanks

A:

You can listen /move_base/status for the status of the current goal. Here is the related document. You can go on with your second goal only if the first one is successful, for example.
Moreover, if you want to try a systematic approach you can use smach to create a state machine with states and transitions etc.
