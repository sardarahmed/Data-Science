Q:

Saving grid map in crsm_slam, how to?

Hi,
I have been using the crsm_slam package so far nicely. I am however unable to save the grid map using the command :
rosrun map_server map_saver -f map

The node gives the message : Waiting for the map
and nothing happens. I had to ctrl-c to kill the map_server, but the map is not saved.
Can someone suggest a way to save the map or what could be the problem?
Thanks
Alex

A:

By default ros map_saver subscribes to topic name "map" to save grid map.
And by default crsm_slam publishes map on topic   "/slam/occupancyGridMap" .    check here
So, to save map
 rosrun map_server map_saver map:=/slam/occupancyGridMap -f map
