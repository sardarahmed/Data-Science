Q:

ubuntu/ros error

I have installed ros hydro and have been using it correctly. BUt after some days, I got a problem. Now whenever I open a terminal, it says:
bash: /home/mudassar/ros/setup.sh: No such file or directory
bash: /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash: No such file or directory
bash: /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash: No such file or directory
Could anyone help to resolve my issue? Is there some problem in my .bashrc file? Please be detailed as I am very new to ubuntu and ros.
Thanks!

A:

You are sourcing /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash in your bashrc, but you have hydro installed. Change electric for hydro.

I have again run
"source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash"
but for the next time when I start terminal, the same message appears as before.

You should update this in your .bashrc, where you originally put the electric entry.

Please guide how can I update it? I am very new to ubuntu or ros. Which commands should I execute in terminal to update my bashrc for hydro?

Just edit the .bashrc in your home with any text editor that you like. You should find a line in there containing electric.
