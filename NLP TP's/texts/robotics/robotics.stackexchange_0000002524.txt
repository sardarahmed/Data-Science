Q:

How to calculate the power required to drive a fan

I need to specify a fan motor combination and wondered if there are formulas that can work this out? The fan we are using is a crossflow fan:

So I'm assuming the power required to drive it is derived from the number of blades, dimensions of blades (including angle of attack), dimension of barrel/wheel and the speed in RPM.
Is this possible or does it need to be worked out practically with experimental measurements etc?
Hopefully this is the correct stack for this question, if not then mods please feel free to edit/close. 

A:

This is very rough, might or might not help you....
Treating it as a macroscopic perspective: 
Kinetic Energy
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
For working energy in a flow, substitute volume with Area*Velocity and mass with density $\rho$
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}\rho Av^3$$
With that, you should be able to estimate (after efficiency corrections) the power required. 
Otherwise, a search for impeller equations might yield something. Most aerospace formulas are directed towards normal propellers with aerofoils.
