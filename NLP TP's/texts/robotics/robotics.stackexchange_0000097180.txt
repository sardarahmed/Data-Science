Q:

Ros diagnostics aggregator, faster stale

Hello,
I have noticed that ros diagnostics aggregator report that a node is "stale" after 5s without any diagnostics messages. Is there a way to reduce it to 2 or 3 seconds ?
I think this value should not be hard coded anyway !
Thanks !

A:

Answering my own question, Using the timeout parameter in the configuration of the analyzer works fine :
Example :
  sensors:
    type: AnalyzerGroup
    path: Sensors
    analyzers:
      base_hk:
        type: GenericAnalyzer
        path: Base Hokuyo
        timeout: 5.0
        find_and_remove_prefix: base_hokuyo_node
        num_items: 3
      tilt_hk:
        type: GenericAnalyzer
        path: Tilt Hokuyo
        timeout: 5.0
        find_and_remove_prefix: tilt_hokuyo_node
        num_items: 3
      imu:
        type: GenericAnalyzer
        path: IMU
        timeout: 5.0
        find_and_remove_prefix: imu_node
        num_items: 3
