Q:

Tutorial 1.2.1 Using rosmake

I just started the Tutorials and the 'rosmake beginner_tutorials' command gives me this output:
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['beginner_tutorials']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/ryan/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120314-092824
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['beginner_tutorials'] to:
[]
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['beginner_tutorials']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
According to the tutorial I should have something like this:
[ rosmake ] No package specified.  Building ['beginner_tutorials']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory
[ rosmake ] /home/dbking/.ros/rosmake_output-2009-09-22-03-17-14
[ rosmake ] [ 0 of 18  Completed ]
[rosmake-0] >>> genmsg_cpp >>> [ make ]
[rosmake-0] <<< genmsg_cpp <<< [PASS] [ 0.39 seconds ]
[ rosmake ] [ 1 of 18  Completed ]
[rosmake-0] >>> roslib >>> [ make ]
...
...
...
[ rosmake ] [ 17 of 18  Completed ]
[rosmake-0] >>> beginner_tutorials >>> [ make ]
[rosmake-0] <<< beginner_tutorials <<< [PASS] [ 0.79 seconds ]
I thought I had followed everything up to this point successfully, but I can't seem to find the problem.  Any thoughts?

A:

You don't seem to have beginner_tutorials in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
You should probably add this line to your ~/.bashrc (after the line which sources the ros setup.bash):
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/beginner_tutorials:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}
