How did you build your map gmapping or hector mapping ? Better share your map build so far, for better info.

i used gmapping demo

A:

It all depends on the computational power of your computer. If you have a fast computer, you can set your mapping parameters to lets say, higher resolution, larger map area, as well as update rate. If you are working on a arduino or a embedded system, you wont be able to set those parameters high because it will slow down the rest of your system.
