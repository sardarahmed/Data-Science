Q:

Naive object recognition based on laser sensor

Hello, I want to use the RaySensor plugin to get the id of the nearest object each ray intersect (instead of the range). I saw the GetFiducial() function, but don't know if it provides this information, could anybody tell me?.
If not, I've seen that the RayShape class has a GetIntersection() function, which I think that returns the information I need. But it would be grand not to have to build a new RaySensor based of RayShape.
Before I discovered this Gazebo forum I posed this same question in the ros answers forum:

, but I think that it fix better here, that's why I'm repetting it.
Thanks in advance!

A:

The laser fiducial interface needs to be fixed. I have create a ticket for it

You can set the retro value for a collision object, and read that back from the laser data.
