Q:

package collada_parser: dae.h not found

Hello,
I'm trying to build ROS from source. The system I am using is:
Ubuntu 13.10
ROS groovy desktop-full
I used this guide to build the system: [I have no karma to post the link]
Ubuntu is a fresh install from disk.
Compiling went well, except that the dependency on the libyaml parser was not solved, I installed those packages and it worked, however when trying to build the collada_parser packages, I get the following error:
kempenaarjj@ce011:~/ros/catkin_ws$ cd /home/kempenaarjj/ros/catkin_ws/build_isolated/collada_parser && 

/home/kempenaarjj/ros/catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j2 -l2
[100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/collada_parser.dir/src/collada_parser.cpp.o
/home/kempenaarjj/ros/catkin_ws/src/robot_model/collada_parser/src/collada_parser.cpp:45:17: fatal error: dae.h: No such file or directory
 #include <dae.h>
                 ^
compilation terminated.
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/collada_parser.dir/src/collada_parser.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/collada_parser.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

The collada packages I got installed on the system(either via the rosdep dependency command or by manually using apt-get:
kempenaarjj@ce011:~/ros/catkin_ws/build_isolated/collada_parser$ dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall | grep coll
collada-dom-dev                 install
collada-dom2.4-dp               install
collada-dom2.4-dp-base              install
collada-dom2.4-dp-dev               install

Also a dae.h is present on the system:
kempenaarjj@ce011:/$ find -name dae.h
./usr/include/collada-dom2.4/dae.h

I already found that there were tickets regarding this in the bug tracker, however they do not state a fix.
Which dependency do I need to install here in order to make this package work?
Regards,
Jan Jaap

I have a similar problem on OSX 10.8. dae.h is installed by homebrew in /usr/local/include/collada-dom2.4 [EDIT] never mind, it looks like I just add to re-run CMake for it to find the collada-dom-config.cmake

A:

My solution was to edit CMakeLists for that package and change the version from 2.3 to 2.4 and then it worked

It worked for me too. I edited the src/robot_model/collada_parser/CMakeLists.txt.
