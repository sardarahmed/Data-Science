Q:

Removing pinning from the hip joint

(Forwarded from DRC Forum)
Hi,
I understand that balancing is still not implemented, but if I'd wish to implement it, how could I remove the pinning so that the robot would actually fall to the ground. I remember there should be some static tag in the urdf file of the robot (/usr/share/drcsim-1.0/ros/drc_robot_utils ?) but was not able to locate it.
Thanks.

A:

I was able to unpin the hip following the settings for DRCRobotPlugin.cc which I found on bitbucket here:
https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim/pull-request/24/pull-request-21-with-minor-fix-branched/diff#chg-plugins/ros/DRCRobotPlugin.cc
To unpin, run the DRC simulator per the tutorial, and in a separate console publish a topic to /mode:
rostopic pub /mode std_msgs/String "unpinned"
Looks like you've got 4 options for the time being.
