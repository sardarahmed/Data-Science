Q:

Problem arising when make ROSARIA

The rosaria installation is successful, but when type catkin_make, the command line shows that:
~/src/rosaria/RosAria.cpp:6:25: fatal error: Aria/Aria.h: could not find such file or directory : Aria/Aria.h
compilation terminated.
make[2]: *** [rosaria/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/RosAria.cpp.o] error 1
make[1]: *** [rosaria/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/all] error 2
How to solve it? Thanks a lot!

The ARIA library should have been downloaded and installed when you used rosdep update and rosdep install rosaria (http://wiki.ros.org/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA).   What was the output of those commands, any errors?

Note that rosdep install rosaria builds and installs ARIA differently than the normal package from Adept MobileRobots.   You can skip that if you want, in which case RosAria should when built use the normal Adept install location /usr/local/Aria instead... but either way ARIA needs to be installed

A:

Provide more details about the system and ROS distro you are using. It seems you do not have your ros workspace properly configured or you are not installing in the ros workspace. Are you sourcing the setup.bash file in your catkin_ws/devel folder properly?
