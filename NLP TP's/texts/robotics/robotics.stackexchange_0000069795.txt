Q:

lidar not publishing /scan data

Hello everyone,
I am currently working on robopeak rplidar,
I used github to setup everything,now everything is running good .but when i launched view_rplidar.launch it launched everything including RVIZ As expected ,but RVIZ didn't show lidar data in its GUI.
When i checked " rostopic echo /scan " it was not publishing anything .
I asked samething on support@robopeak.com they asked to check ros is having the access of rplidar or not
I checked that also by overwriting "sudo chmode a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0"
Yet problem is same .... Rplidar is not publishing/scan data
What can be the other problems
I have configured  tf also .

A:

Disconnect the sensor type in a terminal dmesg and memorise the last lines. Connect the sensor and enter the dmesg command, look for the memorised lines and some lines later you can see something like /dec/acm... Or /dev/ttyU...  the you need the permision for this device chmod or chown and you have to configure the device in the configs your prlaser node
