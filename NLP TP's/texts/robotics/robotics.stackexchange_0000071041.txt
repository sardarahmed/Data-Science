Q:

Gmapping can't run

Hello all of ROS users,
I want to use the gmapping to get the X,Y location data and track path data I followed the the website as follows to install it:http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping
But when I type the command "rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan" in the terminal, it shows
[rospack] Error: package 'gmapping' not found
Does anyone knows how to solve it? Thank you very much for your kindly help.

A:

i think the problem is ros is not able to find the gmapping package . So, first build the gmapping package into your ros workspace.

or first check if it is available by the command $rospack find gmapping

I use the command $rospack find gmapping in the terminal, the error is same as"[rospack] Error: package 'gmapping' not found", but I really have installed it.

where did u install the package. If its in your own workspace then source the setup.bash file
Comment by Terry Su on 2015-12-24:
I installed the package in the "home" folder which is default, and I resource the setup.bash by this command $ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash , but it is not working,too.

here's the problem..
first of all the packages need to be built inside a ros workspace.. like /op/ros/indigo/share. This folder is the defualt workspace of ros. so u clone the git repo into the share folder and then build that . then u will be able to run the node.

I have changed the directory and use "git clone" to installed the file in the rosworkspace successfully.
But when I use the command "rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan", it shows "Couldn't find executable name slam_gmapping below /opt/ros/jade/share/slam_gmapping/gmapping"
