Q:

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'?

Hello !
I am trying to install asctec_drivers so that I can control the quadrotor through ros in morse simulator.
When I try to run the
rosdep install asctec_drivers
i get the following error
ERROR: Rosdep experienced an error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip' Please go to the rosdep page [1] and file a bug report with the stack trace below. [1] :

This look like an old rosdep install. What do you get rosdep --version?

That seems to be a recent version. It looks like a bug to me. Maybe due to a misconfiguration, but it still shouldn't crash.
