Q:

How start the nao_camera node?

$ I am able to use the Python Nodes with the robot NAO using:
$ export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/path/to/pynaoqi/"

and
$ roslaunch nao_driver nao_driver.launch force_python:=true nao_ip:=192.168.1.206

if I want to check which nodes are running:
$ rosnode list

and I obtained the next list:
/nao_behaviors
/nao_controller
/nao_leds
/nao_sensors
/nao_speech
/nao_tactile
/nao_walker

How can I start or launch the nao_camera, because I going to need the image since i work in Computer Vision? I tried with:
$ roslaunch nao_driver nao_camera.launch nao_ip:=192.168.1.206

but I got the next error:  (copy-paste of the terminal)
pablo@pabloNao:~$ roslaunch nao_driver nao_camera.launch force_python:=true nao_ip:=192.168.1.206

Well, what's the error?
Comment by PabloM on 2014-03-26:
"No module named camera_info_manager". Is it correct the way I'm launching the nao_camera node? or I need to past some extra parameters?
Comment by AHornung on 2014-03-26:
Install the camera_info_manager_py package, e.g. "sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-camera-info-manager-py" for ROS Hydro. Did you manually check out the Nao packages or used the released pre-compiled versions (which should already install the dependency)?
Comment by PabloM on 2014-03-26:
I'm using the pre-compiled packages (sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-nao-robot) and not was installed the "camera-info-manager-py just the "camera-info-manager". And now with the image_view I can watch the retrieved image. Thank you so much Armin!

A:

To summarize the answer from the comments (in case someone runs into the same problem): The Python camera driver node in nao_driver requires the package camera_info_manager_py. You can install it in ROS hydro with sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-camera-info-manager-py
The dependency was missing in the package.xml, I'll fix that for the next release.
