Q:

Setting the grid size in costmap

Where can I set the cell size or grid size in costmap 2d? This is the size of the cells into which the map is divided. I am not sure whether this has to be done in costmap or map_server ? I can't find this in the documentation as well.

A:

See the Map Management Parameters of the costmap_2d docs. Specifically, the resolution parameter is what you are looking for - it specifies the meters/cell for the costmap.
Note that that parameter (as well as the other size related parameters like width and height) only apply to rolling maps - if you are using a static_map, these parameters are pulled from the metadata of the static map. See the OccupancyGrid message for details on the information that comes along with the static_map from the map_server.
