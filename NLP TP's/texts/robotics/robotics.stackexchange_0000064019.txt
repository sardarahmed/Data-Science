Q:

/rosout not built mac brew

Hey,
I installed ROS Indigo through homebrew on Mac Mavericks, when I run 'roscore' I get the following error
ERROR: rosout is not built. Please run 'rosmake rosout'

failed to start core service [/rosout]
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

running 'rosmake rosout' gives me
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

After that, when I run 'roscore' I get the same error again, which says rosout isn't built. With 'rosmaster' everything works fine... What am I doing wrong? Thx for Help
Update (moved by William):
Jepp, I followed the tutorial and sourced
source ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash

Is 'rosout' located in ros_catkin_ws/src?

Please update your question with more information instead of using an answer to do so.

Please post the output of export after sourcing your setup.bash file.

A:

roscore is built by the catkin_make_isolated command you ran before and no longer by rosmake. That is why it reports being built already when you run rosmake rosout.
It seems more likely that you forgot to source the setup.bash file? The other thing to check is that you actually have rosout in your workspace and that you built it. But if you are following the from source instructions then you should have it.
You said "I installed ROS Indigo through homebrew on Mac Mavericks". Does that mean you are following this tutorial?:
