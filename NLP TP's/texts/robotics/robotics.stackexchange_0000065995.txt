A:

I don't know of anyone using it, but expect that it should work fine as long as you use the same version of python as was originally installed when running ROS programs.

ROS Indigo and releases before indigo used python 2.7. Conda ships with python 3.5. I have had issues with conda (python 3.5)  messing up the rospy environment; installing anaconda and python ros that ships with python version 2.7 is a big no-no for me.
