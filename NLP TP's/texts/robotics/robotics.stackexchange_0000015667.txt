Q:

Finding relative location of Raspberry Pi robot indoors

I would like to have a Raspberry Pi robot that can find its location in a room relative to an origin point. 

What methods would be cheapest? 
What would the most accurate be?
Are there any others that might be in a sweet spot between the two that I should look into?

A:

For high cost and high accuracy, you can use motion capture systems such as https://www.vicon.com/, https://optitrack.com/, or http://phasespace.com/.  These systems will typically have a dedicated (Windows) computer driving the cameras.  You will have some code to write to pull this data out and transmit to the robot (if that is where you want it).  On the plus side, the hardware on the robot is minimal, just a few retro-reflector spheres or LEDs.
For even higher cost and higher accuracy, you can use a laser based metrology system such as: https://www.nikonmetrology.com/en-us/product/igps or http://www.hexagonmi.com/products/laser-tracker-systems.
A camera and known-location fiducials like ARTags is another option.  Accuracy depends on the number and size of fiducials, and how much effort you put into to calibrating your camera and locations of landmarks.
UWB radios which can measure the time of flight between endpoints is another option. There are two main players here: https://www.decawave.com/ and http://bespoon.com/.  Accuracy will depend on number and placement of beacons.
