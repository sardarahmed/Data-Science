Q:

Transmit a ROS Video topic via video stream

Hi everyone,
I receive a Video stream from my Android device using gcam, process the ros video stream with ar_toolkit and opencv amen want to stream it back.
How can I transfer a ros video topic to a Video stream? Gscam works in one direction only.
Thanks, enjoy the weekend

Ok, more detailed: I plan to do the following chain:
   1                      2           3            4         5                 6  
Android  -- video --> gstreamer ---> ROS   ---> ROS     ---> ? -- video ---> Android
device      stream     server        gscam      ar_pose           stream    
                                                opencv2

Steps 1 to 4 works fine. I integrate some texts and augmented stuff in the video, but I have no idea how to transfer a ROS video msg into a video stream.
Any suggestions?
Best wishes

How are you streaming from android?  I assume its an ip cam app and if so could you post your GSCAM config line from your launch file so I could see how you got the image into gscam..

Where are you attempting to publish this video stream back to?

I wonder how difficult would it be to make gscam also work as a video sink.

A:

Isn't Android Java only or can you use Python/C++ too? If so, try looking at the simple subscriber/publisher code (python/c++).
