Q:

rosbridge how to subscribe from multi rostopic

I know that use such function I can use msg subscribe from the topic called /sensorPacket:
connection.callService('/rosjs/subscribe','["/sensorPacket",0]',function(rsp) {
alert('subscribed to /sensorPacket');
});
But I want information from 2 topics, for example /a and /b .
How can I realize? can I just use in such way:
connection.callService('/rosjs/subscribe','["/a,/b",0]',function(rsp) {
alert('subscribed to /sensorPacket');
});

A:

You can reuse callbacks for multiple subscription requests and as the handler for incoming messages.
subscription_ok_callback = function(rsp) {
    alert("subscribed to /sensorPacket");
}

connection.callService("/rosjs/subscribe", '["/a", 0]', subscription_ok_callback);
connection.callService("/rosjs/subscribe", '["/b", 0]', subscription_ok_callback);

message_received_callback = function(msg) {
    alert("received a message: " + msg);
}

connection.addHandler("/a", message_received_callback);
connection.addHandler("/b", message_received_callback);
