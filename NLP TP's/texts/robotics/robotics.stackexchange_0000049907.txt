Q:

Rectification matrix clarification in stereo vision calibration

I have a Point Grey Bumblebee2 that I am trying to integrate into ROS and I am using the camera1394stereo node to read raw images from both cameras.
I have calibrated both cameras by hand and am currently trying to figure out how to configure the yaml files as specified in the StereoCalibration tutorial
So far, I have successfully undistorted the images.  However, I am very unclear about what values I should put down in the rectification matrix.  What is contained in this matrix?  Is it a rotation matrix of the two cameras orientations with respect to each other?
I have been trying to insert rotations matrices into these values, only to encounter segfaults.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

A:

From the CameraInfo message declaration:

Rectification matrix (stereo cameras
only) A rotation matrix aligning the
camera coordinate system to the ideal
stereo image plane so that epipolar
lines in both stereo images are
parallel.

Alternatively, ROS has a tool built in to do stereo calibration and write it out in the correct format: http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration/Tutorials/StereoCalibration

Perfect!  Thanks for the link

Actually the reason why I tried to calibrate the cameras by hand is because I've had so much trouble using the built in ROS stereo calibration software. http://answers.ros.org/question/60177/cameracalibratorpy-crashes-during-calibration/ .  Have you ever had this problem?
