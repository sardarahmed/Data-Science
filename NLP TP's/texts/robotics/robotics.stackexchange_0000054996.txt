Q:

Select published topics

Hello,
I'm using the  openni_camera and openni_launch stacks with ROS fuerte on a platform with low processing power.
I only need two topics: /rgb/image_rect and /depth_registered/image_rect. Is there a way to only publish those topics in order to speed up the processing time?
Thanks,

A:

You do not have to do that in ROS. Data will (should) be computed only if there is at least one subscriber listening to your topic.
The whole goal here is to reduce the configuration burden of each node. Think of the topic list as a list of capabilities and not a list of produced data.

Is there a way to get topics from more than one Kinect?
Comment by Thomas on 2013-11-01:
I guess if you launch the nodes twice in different namespaces it should work. You may need to connect your two kinects on two different USB controllers though.

Well as I explained in my question here: http://answers.ros.org/question/96071/accessing-multiple-kinects-in-ros-hydro/ I'm not sure exactly how to modify the launch file to launch separate nodes. Any ideas?
Edit: Thanks for the suggestion Thomas, it helped me figure it out.
