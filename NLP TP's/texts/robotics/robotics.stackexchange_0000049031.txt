Q:

TurtleBot Kinect Problem

I am following the tutorial "Visualizing TurtleBot Kinect Data", but I cannot see the data from camera...
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch
it gives:
[ INFO] [1362547950.940390473]: [/openni_camera] Number devices connected: 1
[ INFO] [1362547950.940926034]: [/openni_camera] 1. device on bus 001:10 is a Xbox NUI Camera (2ae) from Microsoft (45e) with serial id 'A00367910023104A'
[ WARN] [1362547950.950968862]: [/openni_camera] device_id is not set! Using first device.
[ INFO] [1362547951.051461572]: [/openni_camera] Opened 'Xbox NUI Camera' on bus 1:10 with serial number 'A00367910023104A'

[ INFO] [1362547951.127139480]: depth_frame_id = 'camera_depth_optical_frame' 

Then on the Workstation, I type:
rosrun rviz rviz
Add camera -> Image Topic -> whatever...
The rviz window shows No Image
And the terminal shows Dropped 100% of messages
Closing rviz, now on the Laptop, I try:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image
It just shows a gray window.
Anyone has any idea what is wrong?
TurtleBot (Kinect, iRobot Create); Ubuntu 10.04; ROS Electric
Please help me!! Thank you very much.
More information: (1) the Kinect shows a flashing green light (not solid light); (2) in rviz, under camera, it says Global Status: Error. Inside it says ... No Transform.

A:

This problem is solved.
The solution is a bit mysterious... In Rviz, the default setting is Global Options -> Fixed Frame -> base_link and Target Frame -> < Fixed Frame >
This setting is correct, but in order to make it work, I need to click them and select them again, and then reboot the workstation and the laptop. I don't know why but it works after then.
In addition, the distributor told me that the flashing (not solid) green light on Kinect is normal.
