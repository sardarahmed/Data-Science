great, but why r the read and write functions empty? it would be more helpful if they were also present. what single board computer were u using to run ros and how did u connect sensors and motors? through gpio, ethercat or serial port?

so sir, basically the only part needed to interfaced with orocos is the hardware interface part right?
Comment by Stefan Kohlbrecher on 2018-05-17:
The read and write functions depend on the hardware you use and how it can be interfaced (perhaps via a driver/library provided by the vendor).
