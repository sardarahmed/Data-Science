Q:

How to programatically set the 2D pose on a map?

How do I programatically set the the initial 2D pose estimate on a map when running acml and move_base - equivalent to the "2D pose estimate" button within Rviz ?

A:

Just to add a little more information. You can set the inital pose of the robot by publishing to the "initialpose" topic used by AMCL and documented here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/amcl#Subscribed_Topics. This is, in fact, what RVIZ does when you use the "2D Pose Estimate" button. You can always user "rostopic echo initialpose" to see exactly what it's sending.
Hope this helps.
