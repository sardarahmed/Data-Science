Q:

Force base_link to stay at 0

My robot has a disc with a radius of 1.25m in contact with the ground. Apparently this is not handled very well by the simulator and the robots drifts slowly with time. How to force base_link to stay at zero position? Is there a way to define as static a link only and not the whole robot?
I am using URDF and world frame doesn't seem to be usable there as parent frame.

A:

Following chapulina's answer, my URDF joint looks like this:
<link name="world"/>
<joint name="joint_base_world" type="fixed">
  <child link="base_link" />
  <parent link="world" />
  <origin xyz="0 0 0" />
</joint>

An explicit definition of the world frame is necessary when using URDF's. This joint stabilizes my robot and makes it fixed at zero position.
