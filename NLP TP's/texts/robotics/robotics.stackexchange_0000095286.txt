Q:

Error launching Rplidar node

Hello everyone.
I am using a RPLidar A1M8 to generate obstacles using move_base and costmap_2d. The problem arrives when I launch rplidar node with the whole system .launch; you can see the include where I call the .launch file of rplidar:
  <include file="$(find rplidar_ros)/launch/rplidar.launch" />

The next error appears on terminal when I launch it:
 [ERROR] [1585914589.956502460]: Error, operation time out. RESULT_OPERATION_TIMEOUT! 
[rplidarNode-20] process has died [pid 14017, exit code 255, cmd /home/sara/catkin_ws/devel/lib/rplidar_ros/rplidarNode __name:=rplidarNode __log:=/home/sara/.ros/log/35a653a0-75a1-11ea-83b0-701ce7079383/rplidarNode-20.log].
log file: /home/sara/.ros/log/35a653a0-75a1-11ea-83b0-701ce7079383/rplidarNode-20*.log

I tried to read the .log file, but it doesn't appear on that directory.
By the way, if I launch first the whole system in one terminal and then I launch the rplidar node using other terminal, it works and I can see rplidar working and generating obstacles on rviz.
What can I do to solve the problem and launch rplidar whit the system together?
Thanks in advance.
Best regrets.
Alessandro
EDIT: I solve the problem not launching other node that uses the same usb port of the rplidar, so it was my fault. Thank you.

Please post your last edit as an answer instead.
And then accept your own answer.
This would convey the fact that your issue was resolved much better than closing a question.
