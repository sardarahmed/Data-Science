Q:

pluginlib build fails: Unknown CMake command "catkin_add_gtest"

What am I missing that would cause this error? For background, I'm attempting to build the velodyne stack from source, because I may need to run the debugger in the future. I have built ros-fuerte from source and installed in /opt/ros/fuerte. I use rosws, roslocate, and rosmake to build stuff from source.
Update:
Here's how I built ros-fuerte:

sudo pip install -U rosinstall
rosinstall --catkin ~/ros-underlay http://ros.org/rosinstalls/fuerte-ros-full.rosinstall
cd ~/ros-underlay
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF
cd ..
make -j8
sudo make install

That's pretty much what the ros wiki describes. I've left out installing necessary dependencies, of course. Running rosversion ros gives me 1.8.9.

What versions of things have you installed where? Did you get the devel or release branches?

A:

Alright. I have an answer. When I run

roslocate info pluginlib

it returns

- hg:
    local-name: pluginlib
    meta:
      repo-name: wg-kforge
    uri: https://kforge.ros.org/common/pluginlib

Notice there's no version information. So when I use this to update using rosws, I get latest, whereas I really want the one tagged as "fuerte". Once I got the matching version, I was able to build using rosmake. To my dismay, this procedure has failed for geometry, however, but that's a different question.

Thanks. For geometry I noticed that I had to set the branch to "fuerte_devel" and the branch for bullet to "default". I posted a question about this.http://answers.ros.org/question/48328/error-class-btmatrix3x3-has-no-member-named-getrpy-when-building-tf/
