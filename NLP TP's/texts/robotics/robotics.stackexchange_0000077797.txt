Q:

rviz high dpi issue

Hi,
I'm having issues on high dpi screen using rviz.
It seemes that the 3d rendering object doesn't scale properly, and each dimension is half the dimension he should be.

I'm using ubuntu (kubuntu) 16.04. Rviz is updated to the lst version
ros-kinetic-rviz:
Installato: 1.12.4-0xenial-20161027-160750-0700
The screen is using a scaling of 2x
Maybe is related to this?
