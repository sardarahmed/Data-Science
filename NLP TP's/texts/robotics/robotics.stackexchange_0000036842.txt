Q:

rxplot is not plotting as it is supposed to be

I've tried to utilize rxplot for visualizing 2 variable values, however, one of them is not plotting. It seems to be disappeared. No color at all. Another one is just plotting out of the box. I run the command like below, for instance:
rxplot /pose_1/pose/position/x, /pose_2/pose/position/x

One could assume that problematic variable value is because of its values is always zero. But, this is not my case.
What could be the culprit or there is any bug with the rxplot?

Yes, it is publsihed, and I even can "rostopic echo /topic" there, and see its values.

Have you confirmed that the message is being properly published?

A:

Finally, the problem is resolved. The culprit is because of the variable is having a constant timestamp. And now I know, it is time-dependent.
