Q:

ROSSerial Msg.h equivalent in ROS

Is their a equivalent in the main ROS structure for the Msg.h contained in rosserial. I have need for the ability to use a single call to serialize and serialize a range of different message types. Any thoughts?

A:

If you're not using Python, I believe the only way to do that would be to use the ShapeShifter (and perhaps in combination with facontidavide/ros_type_introspection).
For ShapeShifter there are some good posts on this board on how to use it / find references. It's not really documented, as it's not really meant as a public API.

what is the shapeshifter meant to do, from what I could tell it looks to be a type of publisher?

As far as I can tell it would seem to allow you to do exactly what you asked for: use a single subscriber to subscribe to multiple topics, each of a different type.

What function would be used for subscribing? All I can see is advertise which would create a publisher.

The ros_type_introspection has some tutorials that will probably help you.
The answer to #q50375 also contains some hints.

Ok, I was looking at the class in the wrong way that is exactly what I need. Thank you.
