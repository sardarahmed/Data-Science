Q:

Where does "catkin run_tests" get tests from?

catkin config --install
catkin build --limit-status-rate 0.1 --no-notify -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin build --limit-status-rate 0.1 --no-notify --make-args tests
catkin run_tests
catkin_test_results build

After doing above for my package, it seems tests are run, even though they are not installed and only available in source space. Is it an expected behavior?
$ dpkg -p python-catkin-tools |grep Ver
Version: 0.3.0-1

A:

Yes, tests are built into the build space and executed there.
