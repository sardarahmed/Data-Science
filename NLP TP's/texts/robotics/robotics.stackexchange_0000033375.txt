Q:

Required tf Transforms in gmapping

In gmapping documents http://www.ros.org/wiki/gmapping,
and in 5.1.5,5.1.6
says that base_link → odom, and map → odom.
I have try to use map → odom → base_link → base_laser.

I don't know "base_link → odom" is right or "odom → base_link" is right? Why?

What's the transform formula between odom and base_link?

Can I output the transform data(map→odom) from gmapping?

Thank you~

A:

odom -> base_link. You are building a tree starting from a fixed frame and going down the attached things.

What do you mean with formula? It should be the robot's motion estimation.

Do you mean output for debugging or generate? For the former use tf_echo (or display in rviz), for the latter: Yes, that's what it's supposed to do.

I haven't written the package, but I would say that it gets the data from  the odom->base_link transform and the motion model is "hardcoded" as gmapping params (instead of using the covariance).

Why my gmapping node doesn't require /odom? Doesn't Gmapping need to know the position of robot or laser range finder?

What could be the reasons of empty map.pgm although it's size is 15.3 MB. Now laser messages are properly published and the tf tree looks ok. But no transform from [/GrndTruth] to frame[/map] and no transform from [/base_GrndTruth to frame[/map].
