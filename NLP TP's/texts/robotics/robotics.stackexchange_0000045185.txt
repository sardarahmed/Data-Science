Q:

Implementation of VFH in ROS

Hello, I would like to know, is there the implementation of the Vector Field Histogram(VFH) method for 2D mobile robot navigation in ROS?
I know ROS has implemented the Dynamic Window Approach(DWA) in the "navigation" stack, but it seems that this is not very suitable for the holonomic robot. Although the "Player" has the implementation of VFH, it cannot be used directly in ROS, so is there the ROS version of it? Or is there the implementation of other state of the art for local motion plan especially for holonomic robot in ROS? I would appreciate for any clues or suggestions, thanks!

A:

Note that the DWA local planner is used on the PR2 (holonomic base), though it was written to drive mostly forward because of 3d sensor coverage in front of the robot (tilting laser).
With suitable parameters / customisation the DWA approach works well for holonomic bases.
