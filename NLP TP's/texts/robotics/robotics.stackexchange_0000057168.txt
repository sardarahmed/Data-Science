Q:

How to run two cameras in ROS at different times?

I am trying to run two cameras on one single board computer with ROS and OpenCV, but I do not want to run the cameras at the same time. I want to run camera A until a specific moment then turn camera A off and turn camera B on; then B off and A on, and so on...
I am not sure how to do this effectively or at all really. I understand how to start up both cameras with a launch file or turn them off and on manually, but I want to do this automatically as certain parameters are met. Any ideas or advice?
Thanks

A:

This is probably a good use case for the capabilities server: http://wiki.ros.org/capabilities ( tutorial )
The capabilities server allows you to declare launch files as capabilities, and then bring them up and down using ROS service calls.

Thanks. I will read up on capabilities to see if that will work.
By the way, one reason I do not want to run two cameras simultaneously is that I receive an error for exceeding the bus capacity. It also seems more efficient to only run the camera that is being used.

I was never able to get the capabilities server working, but I found a way to control two cameras by writing a program to kill and restart the nodes using fork. This wasn't the cleanest method for doing this, but it worked fine for my application.
