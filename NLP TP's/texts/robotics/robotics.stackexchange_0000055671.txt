Q:

How to publish a navigation goal to turtlebot running the amcl_demo.launch navigation with a map file

I want to publish navigation goals to the turtlebot running the amcl_demo.launch with a specific map file.
In general when amcl_demo.launch file is launched with the mapfile, we can send the navigation goals to the turtlebot using the Rviz GUI tool. But i want to send the navigation goals to the turtlebot form a pyhton script that i have written the Navigation Goal parameters in it.
I could figure out that, the Rviz sends the navigation goals to the topic /move_base_simple/goal. I want to know the correct message format of the navigation goal that should be sent to the turtlebot.
How do i get this task done??
Anyone who knows the answer, please help me.
Thank You
