Q:

[ROS + Gazebo + SLAM] How to get specific goal from map?

Hi everybody,
I have set up navigation stack for my mobile robot. Now I want to get specific goal from map (or LaserScan data) based on the shape of scan (let's say I have model of rack with multiple channel sections as it's legs and I want the robot to move near one of this legs). Anybody has idea how to approach this topic?
Thank you for your help!

A:

PCL + RANSAC mentioned there could be a good start:

https://discourse.ros.org/t/how-to-identify-3d-shapes-rectangle-circle-and-square-using-ros-laser-scan-data/4790

https://pointclouds.org/ (PCL)

https://pcl.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/random_sample_consensus.html (RANSAC)

https://answers.ros.org/question/229784/detecting-spheres-using-ransac-in-pcl/ (Sphere detection using RANSAC)

You would detect the configuration and position of the spheres/lines/planes and then use this info to move the robot where you wanted.
