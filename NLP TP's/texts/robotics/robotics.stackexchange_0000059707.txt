Q:

RVIZ Interactive Markers - color change runtime

Hi,
I was wondering if it was possible to change the color of an Interactive Markers during run time?
I tried to change the color of the mesh embedded in the Interactive Markers but nothing occurs when I update the Server:
server.get()->applyChanges();

The architecture of my Interactive Markers is :
visualization_msgs::Marker robot_mesh;
visualization_msgs::InteractiveMarkerControl robot_control; //contain robot_mesh
visualization_msgs::InteractiveMarker robot_marker; //contain robot_control

Thanks

A solution that worked for me was to just clear all interactive markers and reinsert them all with the new colors. Surprisingly, this works even while a marker is being dragged in rviz
