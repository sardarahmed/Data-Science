Q:

Help with people, people_experimental stacks

Hi,
I am trying to do leg detection with LIDAR, and the leg_detector node from people_experimental looks perfect for the job.  The only problem is that I cannot find any documentation on how to use it, and so far my attempts have failed.
Here is a wiki page introducing the leg_detector node.  This page has a broken link, http://home.willowgarage.com/wgwiki/Leg_Detection which supposedly has documentation.
I would greatly appreciate if anyone could share their experiences with the stack, or point me to the the right documentation :)

I am currently working on a forked version that may be able to help. I'll post a full version later in the week.

That would be great, please post a link here once you release it!

A:

An unstable/undocumented version of the people_experimental stack is available here. It has the benefit of doing leg detection without needing facial input in order to recognize people.
I am currently in the process of getting this integrated into Willow's people stack with the help of Caroline Pantofaru. Any suggestions are welcome.
