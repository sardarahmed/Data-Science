Q:

Objects spawning and falling down immediately in Gazebo

I am trying to simulate a table with many objects on it. But some of objects get spawned quicker than the table, and they simply fall down on the floor. Each time different ones randomly.
I am looking for way to stop physics simulation, till all the objects are spawned. Is it possible to write it somehow into launch file? "Pause physics" is a service, not a node, so it gets compicated...

A:

Could you call the pause physics service first, and then spawn each of your objects with the SpawnModel service?

Well, now I do almost like that: in one launch file I spawn only world and table, then I call another launch file which spawns all remaining objects. But it's a kind of workaround. I was looking for a convenient way to do this.
