Q:

How to visualize the trajectory of the robot arm in Rviz, when the Cartesian velocity command is passed?

What should I do to visualise it in Rviz?  geometry_msgs/TwistStamped is used

Hi @pmuthu2s,
I've seen that you've tried to see it using  Markers in RViz in your another question.
By checking the answer in that question we can see that the Markers work, but you have to select the right frame_id when publishing it.
Also, you have to make sure you are really receiving the messages of type geometry_msgs/TwistStamped. You can do that with rostopic echo /TOPIC_THAT_PUBLISHES_TWISTSTAMPED_MESSAGE
Please, that a look in the answer of that your another question.
