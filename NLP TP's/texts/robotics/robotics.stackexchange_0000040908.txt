Q:

move_arm_warehouse package

I've rebuilt ros from sources completely and I don't think it's my installation, but the python script in the move_arm_warehouse package
<move_arm_warehouse>./scripts/create_launch_files.py

uses the following code
directoryName = roslib.packages.is_pkg_dir(robotName + "_arm_navigation")

which gives the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./scripts/create_launch_files.py", line 16, in <module>
    if(not roslib.packages.is_pkg_dir(directoryName)):
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'is_pkg_dir'

anyone else had this problem? is the stack arm_navigation_experimental depreciated to something or not yet updated... or have I don't something wrong?

A:

It seems ROS is planning on phasing out roslib, and leaning toward rospkg, must have missed this one. Anyway the fix is is_pkg_dir has been depreciated to get_pkg_dir - I just edited the script
