Q:

3D model sharing

Hello everyone
I was looking for 3D CAD files of sensors and hardware used with the ROS framework, but not many manufactures have 3D models for download.
So I started trying to search for each sensor:
http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors
But I'm interested in getting everything for designing robots - so motor controllers, motors, sensors, etc used with ROS and has ROS packages available for use.
And Some I find, some I don't when going through google, grabcad etc
So I wanted to know if people would like to share 3D models for robotics?

A:

So I tried to find all 1D,2D,3D sensors and collect them, I found some of them
from:  http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors
If someone is interested it is available for download from my google drive:

I hope someone will share other files.
