Q:

Port to connect to rostest rosmaster after Indigo

Connecting to rosmater with specific port number used to be possible. I see this pull request against Indigo that randomizes the rosmaster port for rostest.
Does this mean that there is now no way to connect to rosmater during rostest?
(I'm seeing an issue that only occurs to me during rostest. I want to see values set in Parameter Server for debug purpose.)
$ dpkg -p ros-indigo-ros-comm | grep Ver

A:

https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/pull/637 replaced the earlier pr and was merged and now rostest --reuse-master pkg foo.test will use the standard ROS_MASTER_URI port.
