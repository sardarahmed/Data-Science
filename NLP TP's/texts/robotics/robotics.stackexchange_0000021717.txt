Q:

Finding the DH parameters from Transformation Matrices

My questions is the following: How do I find the DH values of a given transformation matrix? Or a set of transformation matrices if one is not enough?
I can assume that the angle theta is known for each of them and all other DH parameters are the same accross transformation matrices.
thank you guys,
Alex

A:

Consider the expression at the bottom as the transformation between one system and the next.
If you have the numeric values of this transformation (from coordinate system $i$, to coordinate system $i+1$) you could use the elements of the matrix in equation 3.10 as follows:
$$\theta_i = \arctan \left(\frac{A_{2,1}}{A_{1,1}} \right)$$
$$\alpha_i = \arctan \left(\frac{A_{3,2}}{A_{3,3}} \right)$$
Knowing $\theta_i$, you can then find $a_i$ easily as:
$$a_i=\frac{A_{1,4}}{\cos(\theta_i)}$$
Finally, $d_i=A_{3,4}$
