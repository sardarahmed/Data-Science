A:

Here are some problems I spotted:

The config file cannot have an arbitrary name, it must be called model.config, you're calling it camera.config

The root element of the .sdf file must be <model>, you currently have <world>

When you launch gazebo, run it in verbose mode so you can see error messages that should give you more clues:
gazebo --verbose
