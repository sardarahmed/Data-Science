Q:

Rviz not loading model

Hi,
I'm new to ROS and was having a go at a tutorial for using the Clearthpath Husky simulator.
Gazebo works fine, but Rviz for the husky reports an error finding the model. I get this output in the terminal:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/joint_state_publisher/joint_state_publisher", line 327, in <module>
    jsp = JointStatePublisher()
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/joint_state_publisher/joint_state_publisher", line 25, in __init__
    robot = xml.dom.minidom.parseString(description).getElementsByTagName('robot')[0]
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xml/dom/minidom.py", line 1931, in parseString
    return expatbuilder.parseString(string)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xml/dom/expatbuilder.py", line 940, in parseString
    return builder.parseString(string)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xml/dom/expatbuilder.py", line 223, in parseString
    parser.Parse(string, True)
TypeError: must be string or read-only buffer, not None

I'm using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 13.04. Haven't been able to find a solution for this, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

Running rviz using the command roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch

Hi there,
Are you using the right URDF model of the robot?. It seems that the joint state publisher has difficulty parsing the URDF file. Could you please post the launch file for working with rviz?. Thank you.

Hi,
I was just running this:
roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch
Which I believe is from ros-hydro-husky-desktop.
