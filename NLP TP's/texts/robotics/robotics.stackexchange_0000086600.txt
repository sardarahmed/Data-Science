Q:

ROS Julius error on Kinetic install

I’ve been getting some error about ros-kinetic-julius for a very long time, and wasn’t able to solve it. So I uninstalled ros kinetic and am now trying to re-install it - but the problem is still there. Here is the output, I would appreciate any help!
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
Reading package lists… Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information… Done
You might want to run ‘apt-get -f install’ to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-kinetic-desktop-full : Depends: ros-kinetic-desktop but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-kinetic-perception but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-kinetic-simulators but it is not going to be installed
Depends: ros-kinetic-urdf-tutorial but it is not going to be installed
ros-kinetic-jsk-3rdparty : Depends: ros-kinetic-julius but it is not going to be installed
ros-kinetic-julius-ros : Depends: ros-kinetic-julius but it is not going to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try ‘apt-get -f install’ with no packages (or specify a solution).

After running: sudo apt-get install -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes ros-kinetic-julius
These were the errors I was getting:
----A bunch of logs---
Done
rsync: mkdir "/opt/ros/indigo/share/julius" failed: No such file or directory (2)
rsync error: error in file IO (code 11) at main.c(674) [Receiver=3.1.1]

Errors were encountered while processing:

E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

So this does seem like something very similar to https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty/issues/133.
I'm just new with ROS and need to know how to fix it.
Thanks!

Welcome! Did you try doing what the output tells you?
You might want to run ‘apt-get -f install’

@ZGee as I mentioned in the other post. Please add more details for us to be able to help you more. This doesn't have any more information than your original post, and since it doesn't reference my reply others can't leverage the effort that I already spent cross referencing related issues.

@jayess I have run apt-get -f install on each of the packages listed,a and still have errors

@tfoote right sorry, updated the question. Thanks!
Also it seems like I'm having a very similar problem to https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_3rdparty/issues/133

A:

rsync: mkdir "/opt/ros/indigo/share/julius" failed: No such file or directory (2)

this seems strange to me: you're installing a Kinetic package and it's looking for /opt/ros/indigo. Something is wrong with that package.
