Q:

How to use Benewake CE-30C Solid State 3D Lidar with ROS for getting point cloud?

I have a benewake CE-30C Lidar. Link
I can see how to interface Rp-lidar or Velodyne Lidars, but I can't find much support for this. Can somebody guide me as to how to get the point cloud data that is readable by ROS.

A:

Unless someone else already did the work for you, you'll probably have to write a ROS driver for this device.
Luckily the manual you linked has this to say about the SDK:

SDK is mainly used to develop applications of this LiDAR on Linux system by using C/C++, [..]

so Linux support seems to be ok (or at least: the SDK is usable on Linux).
If the device is more like a Laser Scanner (ie: outputs something akin to scans), you could perhaps use the Velodyne drivers as inspiration.
If it's more like a "traditional" 3D depth camera (ie: outputs point clouds directly), then it might perhaps make more sense to look at the ROS drivers for various depth cameras.

I have found a driver on Github Zlite/benewake
There are no tutorials, could you explain how to view this data in Rviz and use it for generating a map?

I'm afraid I won't have time for that.
I can only suggest to ask the original author how to use his nodes, and to look up the tutorials on how to visualise things in RViz.
