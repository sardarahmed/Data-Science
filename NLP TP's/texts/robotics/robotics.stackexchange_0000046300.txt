Q:

angles::normalize_angle_positive not resolved

I'd like to use the function angles::normalize_angle_positive in a callback function. Unfortunately I constantly recieve the message 'could not be resolved'. I can't find this function in this namespace.

A:

Did you include  angles in the manifest?
Other than that: Copy the exact error and code + commands where this error happens. Do no retype anything.

Hi. Thanks for your answer. Nope I didn't include it in the manifest. I thought i was part of the ros package (I am quite new to ros). I included it and included the correct heade "angles/angels.h" and now it works. Thanks for you hint!

There is a typo: angles/angles.h. Thanks anyway!
