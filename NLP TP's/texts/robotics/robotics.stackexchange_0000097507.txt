Q:

Ros SSH not working

Hi,
I have followed Ros SSH tutorial and is working perfectly.
However, I have change both 'talker' and 'listener' files into a launch file receptively.
The talker.launch is in the client and the listener.launch is at the server.
In the server I have launch an empty world gazebo as well.
When I launch the following in sequence, the talker.launch does transmit data over to the server:

roscore on the server
Set rosclient to the rosserver
launch talker.launch on client
launch empty world gazebo
launch listener.launch

However when I change the sequence by launching gazebo 1st. The talker.launch does not transmit data over. "Topic is there but inside is empty". The following is the sequence.

roscore on server

Set rosclient to rosserver

launch empty world gazebo

launch talker.launch on client

launch listener.launch

Did not work so I tried rostopic echo/"Talker_topic"
output: no message receive and simulated time active.

May I know is this an SSH bug?

Update:
Seems like changing
rate.sleep()
to
time.sleep()
did the trick. I still don't know why tho.
