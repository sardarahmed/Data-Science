Q:

gaussian noise param for gazebo_ros_imu

what are the units of gaussianNoise here:
  <plugin filename="libgazebo_ros_imu_sensor.so" name="imu_plugin">
        <topicName>imu</topicName>
        <bodyName>imu_link</bodyName>
        <updateRateHZ>10.0</updateRateHZ>
        <gaussianNoise>0.0</gaussianNoise>
        <xyzOffset>0 0 0</xyzOffset>
        <rpyOffset>0 0 0</rpyOffset>
        <frameName>base_link</frameName>
      </plugin>

my imu doc tells me it has a Noise Density:< 0.14 mg/âˆšHz, how do I translate that to this plugin?

A:

The answer is its the sigma (standard deviation) so its the same units as the inputs.
