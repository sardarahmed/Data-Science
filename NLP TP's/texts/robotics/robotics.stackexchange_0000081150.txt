Q:

Global frame of local costmap and goal accuracy

Hi all,
I'm confused about global frame of local costmap. I'm trying with sbpl and pose follower. Since I want to follow the global plan as close as possible, I tried to change global frame of local costmap to map. It follows path reasonably however it jumps and sometimes collides due to jump. On the other hand to get rid of jumps when I switch to odom frame in local costmap, this time a considerable offset is seen especially when robot reaches the goal. End of global plan and the robot pose are apart 5-10 cm.
How can I get rid of this error at goal but follow the global path as close as possible? Is there a problem with my interpretation of global frames of costmaps?
Thanks

A:

The pose_follower has two parameters that control the goal tolerance:
tolerance_trans (default 0.02) and
tolerance_rot (default 0.04).
So if you have not changed these parameters, it is normal that your robot is 5-10 cm apart from a goal when it "reaches" it.
Anyway, keep in mind that an error of 10cm is quite small and acceptable in many applications.

However when I use map as global frame of my local costmap, it always end up with a smaller error than the configuration with odom. Is there a relation between goal error and local costmap global frame?
