Q:

Error installing Ros Melodic

I'm trying to install ROS Melodic on Linux Mint (based on Ubuntu bionic). I have configured my Ubuntu repositories and I have followed the installation guide. Should I install any package before ros melodic?
The error is the following, I am dealing with unmet dependencies:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

A:

Well, the standard output is not very informative, so to see what is wrong sometimes is useful to trace the installation process(it depends on what are used: apt-get or aptitude):
apt-get -s -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes install ros-melodic-desktop
or
echo q | aptitude -s install ros-melodic-desktop
