how to remove the ros? sorry, I am a beginner

A:

You are running a very old version of rospkg. The last verion released is 1.0.35 your traceback indicates 1.0.2 which was released in April 2012.
Also from your trackback I can see it's located in /usr/local/lib which is indicative of a pip/easy_install based installation. You should make sure to uninstall that copy which will mask out the newer version from the debian packages. To see how to uninstall via pip you can get instructions here
To see what version you're running check that you get something like the following.
$ dpkg -l | grep rospkg
ii  python-rospkg                                         1.0.35-1                                            all          ROS package library
$ pip freeze | grep rospkg
rospkg==1.0.35
