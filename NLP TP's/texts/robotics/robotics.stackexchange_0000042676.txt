Q:

doxygen: not found

Hi,
I came across with problems when installing openni_kinect following this website:http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect,

Creating Doxygen...
sh: 1: doxygen: not found
failed to execute: doxygen Doxyfile > /home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/drivers/openni/build/openni/Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/Output/EngineDoxy.txt
Creating Documentation Failed!
make[1]: *** [installed] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/drivers/openni'
make: *** [openni_lib] Error 2

How to fix it?
