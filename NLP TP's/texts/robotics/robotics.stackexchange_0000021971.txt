Q:

Attaching electronics to a very bad chassis

I had a misfortune to buy this very poorly made tracked chassis.
I now have some Arduino-based controller to attach to it. I see three posts with what seems to be holes for screws, and two of them even appear level :). Nothig I find on the internet matches the layout. In fact, there is no documentation on that chassis that would describe the layout.
Is there some generic part I could customize to cover this situation? Any tips and tricks for attaching PCBs to chassis would be appreciated.

A:

If you need to use a chassis so poorly made, its manufacturer has pushed you out of the realm of engineering and into tinkering.
I would suggest that you release yourself from the desire for precision, elegance, and beauty. Instead, embrace the embarrassment of cardboard, foamcore, X-acto knives, hot glue, and toothpicks.
Especially when it's necessary, such tinkering can actually be freeing. Commenter jsotola might agree.
