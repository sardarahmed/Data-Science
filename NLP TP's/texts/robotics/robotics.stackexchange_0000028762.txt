Q:

MoveIt setup assistant crashes during collision matrix building

I am trying to use MoveIt! with a custom robot. I have buit a simple one arm robot that can rotate around 2 axes.
I have installed the MoveIt!, built the robot and now I want to generate the moveit files using the MoveIt setup assistant. When I load the model description into the assistant, the whole robot is red.

When I click the Create Collision Matrix button in the Self-Collisions tab, the assistant crashes. Closes itself and prints on the terminal only, that the process has died. The terminal outputs speaks about a log, but this log was not created. So I don't even know what error I got.

the full terminal output:

Do you have any idea? What can cause it? What else can I check? I am trying to understand the MoveIt!, so far without much success. So I will be glad for any explanations. Thank you.

You may have better luck asking this at https://answers.ros.org/, since the question is not Gazebo-related.

A:

The collision matrix was successfully generated once I modified the revolute joint velocity and effort limits to a specific number instead of -1. The robot, however, stays all red.
