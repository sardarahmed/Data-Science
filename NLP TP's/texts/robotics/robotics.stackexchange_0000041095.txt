Q:

Problem compiling face_recognition (procrob_functional)

Hi Ros users,
I would like to use face_recognition (procrob_functional) but I have got an error while compiling :
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/Fclient.dir/src/face_rec_client.o: undefined reference to symbol 'vtable for boost::detail::thread_data_base'
/usr/bin/ld: note: 'vtable for boost::detail::thread_data_base' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libboost_thread.so.1.46.1 so try adding it to the linker command line
/usr/lib/libboost_thread.so.1.46.1: could not read symbols: Invalid operation
collect2: ld a retourné 1 code d'état d'exécution
make[3]: *** [../bin/Fclient] Erreur 1
Any help welcome.
Thanks in advance
Christophe

A:

I encountered the same problem today and just followed the answer tor proposed. I want to clarify the answer for newbies like me

rosbuild_link_boost(Fserver thread)

rosbuild_link_boost(Fclient thread)

add these two lines after this one

rosbuild_add_executable(Fclient
src/face_rec_client.cpp)
