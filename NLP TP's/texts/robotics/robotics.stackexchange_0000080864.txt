Q:

How to show multiple LINE_STRIPs?

I want to show the boundaries of the road.
The boundary has many points, I use LINE_STIP to do this. But as the road has two boundaries, although I give them different id, RViz still connect the end point of boundary1 to the start point of boundary2.
Is there any method to make boundary1 and boundary2 not connect with each other?

A:

The easiest way to do so is by creating two separate LINE_STRIP markers, inserting them both in a MarkerArray and publishing that. There are a few sentences about the MarkerArray in the rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker page, but there doesn't seem to be a specific tutorial. Anyhow, it's identical to how you deal with Markers, but you have to publish a MarkerArray now and load the corresponding plugin in RVIZ.

In my previous code, I just use one marker and give it different id every time. It seems it doesn't work. I tried to create two markers, and each publishes a line_strip. Now they are not connected in RViz. Thanks for your suggestion.
