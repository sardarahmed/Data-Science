Q:

Trouble with building 'rviz' in hydro [Possible cause shiboken]

Hi there!
I am new to ROS community and currently building hydro from source on ubuntu 12.04. I have been following the wiki and am having trouble with building rviz package. I am on this step:
user@ubuntu12.04:~/ros_catkin_ws/$./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Until now, my errors were mainly due to the absence of some C++ header files, but in this case, I am not sure what the error is. Here is my log:
-- Found PythonInterp: /usr/bin/python (found version "2.7.3")
-- Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE: /usr/bin/python
-- Python version: 2.7
-- Using Debian Python package layout

user@ubuntu12.04:~/ros_catkin_ws/$

I tried removing the shiboken as suggested, but then it showed an error of "Shiboken binding generator NOT available." Can anyone point out what I am missing? Or just point me to the right page? Tell me if you require some other info:)

A:

This doesn't look like a problem with shiboken.
It looks like it's failing to find yaml-cpp:
--   package 'yaml-cpp>=0.5' not found

Have you tried using rosdep to install the required dependencies?
rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
