Q:

StereoCalibration GUI doesn't start

This is the message displayed in the console:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 right:=/optris/thermal_binary left:=/camera/rgb/image_rect_color left_camera:=/camera/rgb right_camera:=/optris
('Waiting for service', '/camera/rgb/set_camera_info', '...')
OK
('Waiting for service', '/optris/set_camera_info', '...')
OK
And nothig happens.
Mono calibration worked well for both camera
camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/optris/thermal_binary camera:=/optris
camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.108 image:=/camera/rgb/image_rect_color camera:=/camera/rgb

Stereo calibration for separate cameras requires that the two cameras are synchronised. Are the timestamps of the messages from each camera the same?

They are synchronised.

A:

I was also getting a blank gui until I tried with the --approximate argument.  Try using
--approximate=0.1 or 0.3
along with your command.
