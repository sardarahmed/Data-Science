Q:

can ros communicate between different versions via WIFI?

Hi,
Can two different versions of ros1 communicate between two different distributions or do all computers have to be the same?
Example between melodic on Raspberry PI (arm) and Noetic on Ubuntu (intel).
ta!

Wifi doesn't change anything here. It's a plain "can two different ROS versions communicate" type of question.

A:

I'll point to an answer left by @Dirk Thomas.

As long as the specific messages have not been changed between the two ROS distributions (which is only rarely the case) it should be work fine...
