Q:

no such option: --rosdep-install

Hello,
I have been trying to build pi_vision package with no success. I have been following the steps explained on: 3w.ros.org/wiki/pi_face_tracker
I have downloaded the source to one of the folders which is specified on the environment variable $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
The problem is whenever I run the command:
rosmake --rosdep-install pi_vision
An error message is output to console as follows:
"
Usage: rosmake [options] [PACKAGE]...
rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install
".
How can I solve this problem?
Best regards

A:

The instructions lag a bit behind the development of tools, making it difficult ( I have lots of problems with it as well).
But rosdep is now a standalone tool. So I think you should use rosdep install pi_vision or rosdep install uvc_cam
Edit: Both do not seem to work...
rosdep install uvc_cam
failed to load symbols, rosdep will not function properly
Cannot import rospkg, rosdep will not function properly
Traceback (most recent call last):
