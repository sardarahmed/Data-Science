Q:

rplidar_node on ros2 / Autoware drops message for ‚Unknown‘ reason

I‘m using Autoware and the rplidar_node showing correct messages (ros2 topic echo scan) but it fails to get them shown on rviz2 with this error message

[INFO] [1625892725.336256970] [rviz]: Message Filter dropping message: frame 'laser_frame' at time 1625892723.515 for reason 'Unknown'

When I use ros melodic everything works fine.

A:

This is likely because the global frame that you have set in rviz2 is not laser_frame and you haven't defined a transform between laser_frame (the frame in which the laser scans are being published) and the global frame that you are using in rviz2. In order to visualize the scan data while using a global frame other than the sensor's frame, you must define and publish (either with a URDF file and robot_state_publisher or tf2_static_transform_publisher) the frame transform between the laser's frame and at least one other frame in your transform tree (usually base_link). Hope this helps.
