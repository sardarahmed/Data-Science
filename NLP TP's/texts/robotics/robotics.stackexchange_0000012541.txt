Q:

Do robots usually have databases?

I am a junior web developer working mainly with Bash, Javascript, and Drupal. I'm more fascinated writing scripts and programs that do certain concrete actions instead of querying and manipulating databases.
I do desire to step into robotics in the future (after completions) and had the following question in my mind:
Do robots usually have databases (similar to these of websites in quality and quantity) and if so, please give a practical example what are they using for? Maybe in the context of machine vision or machine motion.
Update (13/11/19):
All the answers here are good in my opinion. If I could I would accept all of them, I suggest to start by reading the answer of user16549 which makes an introduction to DBs in robots, then continue to the answer by FooTheBar, and then read other answers.

A:

Databases are important for robots to store information...
...about itself:

Where was I when I was turned off
How is my hardware configuration (e.g. intrinsic calibration for cameras)
How warm was my motor when I used it last time for 10 minutes (important to detect defects)
How did I move my arm the last time to grasp (caching of planned movements)
How far did I drive with this set of wheels?

...about the environment:

a map
important positions in the map (a table, a door, a CNC machine)
where am I not allowed to drive to

...about objects:

how does this coke-bottle look like that I have to bring to my owner

...about jobs:

What was I doint when I had to stop for a recharge
How fast did I finish this task the last 500 Times

Persistent storage is very important for robots. Some information (like calibration) is only important for a single robot, other infos like maps or object descriptions should be shared between robots and have to be synced. 
So databases are very important for modern robots.
