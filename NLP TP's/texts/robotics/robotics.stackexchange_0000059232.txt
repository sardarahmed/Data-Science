Q:

How do I check if a ROS message has changed?

Hi,
I'm trying to write a unit test that tests converting between some messages types and one of the things I'd like to do is have a test that fails if the message's .msg file has changed at all (this is because it's important that the conversion functions be updated with the changed message and I want a reminder to do so).  I'd be happy to just hard code the current message MD5 sum into my test, but how do I check the MD5 sum of the message to make sure it matches?
Thanks,
Jenny

I'm pretty sure are ways to retrieve a message's MD5 sum through the C++ and python APIs. I'm not sure how well it's documented, so you may want to inspect the generated python or C++ files.

A:

In rospy:
import roslib
roslib.load_manifest('std_msgs')
import rospy
import std_msgs.msg

print std_msgs.msg.Header._md5sum
