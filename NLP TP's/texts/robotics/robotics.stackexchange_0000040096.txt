Q:

rosjava actionclient and roscpp actionserver

Hi all,
I can send msg from rosjava based actionclient to roscpp based actionserve. I have found that only first time waitForResult() in actionclient works:
finished_before_timeout = sac.waitForResult(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
If I code sends goals many times then server gets the msga but client does not wait after first time at the above statement. Has someone else faced the same problem. Is there any solution how to send a goal again and wait for that in rosjava client?
I get follwing excepiton:
java.lang.NullPointerException
at plannerC.main_planner(Unknown Source)
at plannerC.onStart(Unknown Source)
at org.ros.internal.node.DefaultNode$1.run(DefaultNode.java:495)
at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1110)
at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:603)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:636)
Thanks and regards

A:

actionlib isn't yet supported with the latest release of rosjava. I will remove it from the repository for clarity.
