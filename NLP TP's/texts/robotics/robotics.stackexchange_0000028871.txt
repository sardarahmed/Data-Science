Q:

Can i share variable within instances of model plugin?

I am spawning objects that fall into virtual bin. I created model plugin for objects, that reads their positions. From what i understand each plugin is running separately for each model a they don't share any variables.
My goal is to delete last XY spawned objects if one of them is outside of the bin. Is there any way that i can share for example boolean within all instances of plugin, so when one object is out, other objects are also aware of this?
thanks

A:

For this kind of functionality, I recommend you use a WorldPlugin, which has access to all objects at once.
