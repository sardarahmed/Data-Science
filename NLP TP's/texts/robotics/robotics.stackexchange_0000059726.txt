Q:

‘class octomap::ColorOcTree’ has no member named ‘genKey’ (hydro)

Hi guys,
I have to make fuerte code runable under hydro. By compiling one package i get the following error:
‘class octomap::ColorOcTree’ has no member named ‘genKey’

I read in this log entry https://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/browse/trunk/otherlibs/octomap/CHANGELOG.txt?r=3081, that genKey is deprecated. The author seems to use coordToKey instead. I tried that, but the problem is, that this function doesn't return a boolean value like genKey. But in the code this boolen is needed for an if clause. Does someone know, which function does the same like genKey and returns a boolean.
Thanks

A:

Please refer to the official API documentation of OctoMap online: http://octomap.github.io/octomap/doc/
If you need the bool return value there is a function coordToKeyChecked as replacement.
