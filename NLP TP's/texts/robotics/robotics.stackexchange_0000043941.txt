Q:

port or not to port

Hi,
I'm new to ROS and seems there is a fundamental thing I can't understand please help:
If on a system, say Android, I'm running the 'core' of ROS, could I write a node on another system?
To me the answer seems to be 'yes', as I runned the ubuntu-arduino hello world tutorial, well, the cor is on ubuntu and node handler is being executed on arduino independently.
If this is right, then I could port a minimum software to any other processor (wish for Broadcom, for a router with OpenWRT), right?
What is the degree of complexity there, more than 10 files needed to be implemented, so that I run 1 node on anther system, yes, no, comments?
Thank you,

A:

The "roscore" is mostly just an XML-RPC server that helps ROS nodes on the network establish connections between each-other. It doesn't matter what platform a ROS node is running on as long as it can communicate over the network.
