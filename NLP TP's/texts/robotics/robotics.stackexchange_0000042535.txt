Q:

How to Update Documentation of ROSJava PubSub Example?

The example ROSJava publish/subscribe programs given here are outdated.  Specifically the constructor for org.ros.namespace.GraphName is private and replaced with factory method GraphName.of(...).
How does one go about updating the docs?

A:

If it is just one thing, just create a ticket.
https://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/list

If it is many things, checkout the rosjava source, change the docs, create a ticket and submit the patch.
See
https://code.google.com/p/rosjava/source/checkout

and

I'm glad I found this post, because the example still hasn't been changed.
For others in this situation, that example would be 'return GraphName.of("rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/talker");'
