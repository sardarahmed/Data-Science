Q:

Edit existing building in Gazebo?

I've created and exported a building using the building editor*. Is it possible to open that building up in the editor to change it?
*Awesome tool by the way. Thanks guys!

A:

Unfortunately, currently it is not possible to edit it back with the building editor (issue #1634).
You can edit some aspects of it in the model editor, but all the information about what is a wall, a door and so on is lost.
