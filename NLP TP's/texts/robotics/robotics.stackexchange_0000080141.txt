Q:

[rtabmap_ros] Cannot mapping by RVIZ

I try to use hand-held kinectv2 to record map and follow the steps in tutorials(RGB-D Hand-Held Mapping With a Kinect). Then I can record map by following steps in rtabmapviz, but fail in rviz. There is an error in "Global Status". It show "Fix Frame [map] is not exist". How do I setup?
Below are my steps:
$ roslaunch kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge.launch publish_tf:=true

$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 -1.5707963267948966 0 -1.5707963267948966 camera_link kinect2_link 100

$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" rviz:=true rtabmapviz:=false

A:

Following the tutorial for kinect2_bridge, you should use this for the third step:
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" rgb_topic:=/kinect2/qhd/image_color_rect depth_topic:=/kinect2/qhd/image_depth_rect camera_info_topic:=/kinect2/qhd/camera_info rviz:=true rtabmapviz:=false

cheers
