Q:

Having trouble recompiling ROS Source / What to do when you have two versions of ROS installed?

Good morning,
I have successfully installed ROS Indigo from source following the instructions at:
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source
Everything works great as far as I can tell, the installation succeed without errors. I am trying to verify that I am running off of the source install rather than the installation I had on my computer previously(regular indigo v. source indigo). I attempted to test this by editing a std:cout in rosout.cpp so that I would see a change at the beginning of a log after I recompiled. It did not change though.
This is how I recompiled after making the changes to rosout.cpp:
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --pkg rosout --force-cmake

Then I ran:
roscore
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

to regenerate some log files. The log files did not change though which leads me to believe that I didn't compile the source code correctly, or I a not running my turtlesim example off of the source installation.
Some Info:
dev@dev-VirtualBox:/opt$ printenv | grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=indigo
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros

I am not sure how to confirm / solve those issues. Does anyone know if I should be adding something to my bashrc?
Thanks!

At the bottom of my bashrc file, I found this line:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

and replaced it with
source ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash

Everything works great now. Thank you so much for taking your time to answer this.

Cool, I converted my comment to an answer. Please mark it as accepted when you get a chance.

A:

Make sure you are not sourcing the /opt/ros/.../setup.bash file in your ~/.bashrc. Then make sure you source the result of your workspace, like source /path/to/catkin_ws/install_isolated/setup.bash.
