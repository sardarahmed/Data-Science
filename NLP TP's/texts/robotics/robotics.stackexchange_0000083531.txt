Can you update your question to tell us what you've already found yourself? Searching (with Google fi) for ros dynamixel returns plenty of results.

A:

Actually, I am also a beginner however currently we are trying a few things related to ROS with Dynamixel. The things you can try are as follows:-

Using Dynamixel_SDK which has official support from ROBOTIS  https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK

Using FTDI driver https://github.com/HumaRobotics/dynamixel_hr   #This link has installation for FTDI

dynamixel_motor- This ROS package was used widely till the official SDK came out. However, it still may be useful. https://github.com/arebgun/dynamixel_motor    #This has ROS documentation as well.

Hope this helps.
Note:-

The header file called dynamixel.h which we used in MATLAB does not work with Linux. So don't waste your time with that for Linux.
We are trying on the EX-106+ model but mostly it should work for your model as well.
