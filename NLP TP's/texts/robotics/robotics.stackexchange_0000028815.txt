Q:

Programming in Gazebo using source code

Hello, I am writing a comparison between V-REP and Gazebo simulators. I have used V-REP in simulation, but I have not used Gazebo. I want to know if I can simulate a robot without coding in ROS?.. I mean can I write my program using source code in Gazebo? if the answer is No, why? thanks for help.

A:

Yes, you can write plugins in C++ which are independent of ROS. See this tutorial.
