A:

Which ROS version/distribution do you want to use ? As far as I know there is no ROS version supported for ubuntu 21.04 yet.
See reps for more details:
For ROS1: https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html
For ROS2: https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html
You can also check distributions link:

For ROS2: https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Releases.html

Hi @Youssef_lah, thanks for your answer, I've installed fresh copy of Ubuntu 21.04 on my desktop computer just to work with ROS. I wonder when would there be a release of ROS for this version of Ubuntu.. I wanna get into learning more about ROS, unfortunately it is not possible at this point of time :(

You can simply delete ubuntu 21.04 and install 20.04 then install ROS1 noetic or ros2 (foxy or galactic), then start learning/practicing, you don't have to wait for a new version for 21.04.

thank you @Youssef_Lah for the advice.. I'll install Ubuntu 20.04 on my machine, I'm also new to Robotics. Could you please suggest me a good book on Robotics.. I'm a software engineer who is also interested in Robotics. Currently I'm taking Stanford's(Oussama Khatib sir's) "Introduction to Robotics". I would be grateful if you could suggest a book :)
