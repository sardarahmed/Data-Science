Q:

Unable to run cameracalibration: module cv2 not found

I am trying to run the camera calibration for my videre stereo camera's.I built the camera calibration package and it did nt give any errors.But when i am trying the camera calibrator node it is givving erors like "no module cv2 found".I tried to find find cv2.so but i found only cv.so.So i commented out import cv2 and just used import cv.Also i changed everywhere in the code where there is cv2 to cv.Now when i am trying to run the node i am getting the following errors.
Exception in thread Thread-4:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/lib/python2.6/threading.py", line 532, in __bootstrap_inner

File "/home/srik/ros/image_pipeline/camera_calibration/nodes/cameracalibrator.py", line 73,

292, in redraw_stereo
if len(drawable.params) != 0:

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
I am stuck at this point.I dont know how to proceed from here.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Thanking you

Are you running against Diamondback or E-Turtle beta or trunk?

A:

This looks like you have mismatched versions of code. The Diamondback version of camera_calibration does an import cv, not an import cv2 (source is here). However, trunk (i.e. E-Turtle development) does do an import cv2 (source is here). So if you were running all Diamondback code, there shouldn't have been an import cv2 in the first place. The rest of your errors likely follow from E-Turtle using a newer version of OpenCV than Diamondback.
Make sure that all of your code is checked out from Diamondback tags or branches and not image_pipeline trunk.
