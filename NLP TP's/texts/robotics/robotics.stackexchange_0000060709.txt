Q:

rqt_graph colors and arrows

What is the color code for rqt_graph?
And do the bi-directional arrows mean a service between two nodes or just that the node subscribes to AND publishes to the other node or both?
Is there some sort legend for colors, shapes, arrows etc. ?
Thank you

A:

As far as i know, every publish/subscribe has its own arrow, even if nodes are forming a pub/sub loop.
for color code :

Red box : Topic
blue circle : node publishing under the topic
Green circle : node subscribing to that topic

Anything you hover on becomes red. With stuff before that blue and after green. If there's bi-directional arrows, it shows up blue-green. So that can't be right ^.
I have seen orange / yellow too. The only thing I know for certain is topics are in boxes and nodes in ellipses.
