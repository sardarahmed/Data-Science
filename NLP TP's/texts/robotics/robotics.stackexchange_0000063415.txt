Q:

pick replanning

how do i set the number of planning attempts for when i do a pick. i am using a single grasp.
group_->setNumPlanningAttempts(25); doesn't seem to do it for me.
my terminal currently shows me :
[ INFO] [1413790159.614425456]: Starting scene monitor

A:

In C++ you have:
moveit_msgs::PlanningOptions options;
options.replan = true;
options.replan_attempts = y;

moveit_msgs::PickupGoal goal;
goal.planning_options = options;

Or in you case:
group_->allowReplanning(true);

In python you have:
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander(blablabla)
group.allow_replanning(True)

There is no attribute in the Python API for the number of attempts but if you need to change it you can implement it yourself in move_group.py
