Q:

How to dynamically update mass/center of mass/inertia during Gazebo sim

Hi,
Components in the URDF files can be assigned static mass, center of mass, and inertial matrix.
Is there a way to update those values dynamically once the Gazebo simulation environment has started up?
For example, say I had a fuel tank on a robot and I wanted to decrease the weight and center of mass of the tank as a function of engine power output over time. Or maybe I have a robot expelling a liquid from a holding tank or sucking up a liquid into a holding tank.
I can't seem to find a solution to this in the ROS docs.
Thank you,
Randy

A:

Yep...just needed to look a little longer. The GetMass() and SetMass functions in the Gazebo inertial physics library had what I wanted.
Thanks!
