Q:

actionlib fibonacci_server doesn't move at all

Hi, I am a beginner to use ROS.
(ubuntu 12.04, and ROS distribution is hydro. but I have installed both groovy and hydro.)
Now, I finished Beginner Level of Core ROS Tutorials and then tried to do actionlib_tutorials.
I only followed the instructions in this URL
(http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/SimpleActionServer%28ExecuteCallbackMethod%29),

Start a roscore in a new terminal

$ roscore

Until the section above, I did well.
But in the next section below, I failed.

And then run the action server:

$ rosrun learning_actionlib

fibonacci_server You will see something similar to:

[ INFO] 1250790662.410962000: Started node [/fibonacci], pid [29267], bound on [aqy], xmlrpc port [39746], tcprosport [49573], logging to [~/ros/ros/log/fibonacci_29267.log], using [real] time To check that your action is running properly list topics being published:

If I command the sentence below,

$ rosrun learning_actionlib fibonacci_server

there was no response.
I would like to know why.
If I run the command

$rostopic list -v
,I got these messages.

A:

Might be that it is just some logger settings.
To check if the node is running, run the following command rosnode list and see if your actionserver pops up. In that casse, you can try to continue with the tutorial and check if the server answers.

Thank you for answering my question and I am sorry for my late reply.
If I run the command "rosnode list",
/fibonacci
/rosout
only these words were displayed.
It seems that actionserver doesn't work well....

Just after fibonacci_server and fibonaccci_client are started, I run that command then I could get these messages"
/fibonacci
/rosout
/test_fibonacci"
