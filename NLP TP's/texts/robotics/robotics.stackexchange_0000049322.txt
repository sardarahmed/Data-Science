Q:

2D Navigation Stack Global Path Planning Method?

With reference to the ROS Navigation Stack: I was wondering which:
a) global path planning method is implemented &
b) which local navigation method is implemented?
Thanks!

A:

The navigation stack uses plugins for the local and global planners.
The RobotSetup Tutorial describes the basics of how to set up the navigation stack, including how to select which path planners to use.
base_local_planner and dwa_local_planner can both be used as local planners. They both work similarly, but the code for the dwa_local_planner is much cleaner.
carrot_planner, navfn and sbpl_lattice_planner can all be used as global planners.
navfn is fast, but it produces paths with a lot of entropy, which are harder for non-holonomic robots to follow. When configured properly, the SBPL planner can plan for very constrained bases, including non-holonomic and ackermann-type bases.
