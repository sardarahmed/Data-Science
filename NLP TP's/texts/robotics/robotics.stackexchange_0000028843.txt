Q:

Gazebo Static Map Plugin not loading

I am trying to use the Gazebo static map plugin following the tutorial at http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=static_map_plugin&cat=build_world. However, when I launch Gazebo, with the command gazebo --verbose static_map_plugin.world, the world appears white, and an error shows in the console.
[Err] [Plugin.hh:180] Failed to load plugin libStaticMapPlugin.so: libStaticMapPlugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I've looked throughout my computer, but I can't find this file, and as far as I can tell, it should come with Gazebo. What do I need to do to fix this?
This is on Gazebo 9.0.0 with ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.

the link appears to be broken. Can you fix it? I never heard of Static Map Plugin and was not able to find any reference on google search.

I've fixed the link. I made a mistake copying it over from ROS answers.

I found this plugin in folder /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-7/plugins.

I looked in that location, and the libStaticMapPlugin.so file isn't there. I have installed Gazebo through the ros-melodic-desktop-full package. Did you install Gazebo another way, or with extra packages?

I have definitely used one of those  approaches to install Gazebo.

A:

After a lot of searching and building from source, I discovered that the static map plugin is for Gazebo 10, not Gazebo 9.
