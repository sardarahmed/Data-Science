Q:

Qt Creator cannot find moveit headers

My computer's OS is Ubuntu 12.04 with Groovy and I am working with the source installation of ros moveit. To modify one of the moveit packages I tried to open a package in qtcreator (execute qt creator from console --> 'open project' --> op Cmakelists) to benefit from code completion etc. However, I am facing two issues:

running cmake on package pr2_moveit_tutorials fails and I am receiving the following errors:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:3 (install):
install TARGETS given no RUNTIME DESTINATION for executable target
"planning_scene_tutorial".
So far I circumvent this issue commenting out the 'target_link_library' lines in the Cmakelists. Perhaps cmake fails due to the catkin_make build system?

some headers cannot be found. The file 'motion_planning_interface_tutorial.cpp' contains the following headers:

include moveit/robot_model_loader/robot_model_loader.h
include moveit/planning_pipeline/planning_pipeline.h
include moveit/planning_interface/planning_interface.h
include moveit/kinematic_constraints/utils.h
include moveit_msgs/DisplayTrajectory.h
include moveit_msgs/PlanningScene.h
QT creator only finds the last two headers. In contrast to  moveit_msgs, 'moveit', is not really a package and that is probably the reason why QT creator cannot find the headers. Adding the following line to Cmakelists does not solve the issue...
include_directories(~/ros/workspace/moveit/src)
Any idea how to point QT Creator to the headers?
Thanks!

Did you use qt_ros to create your package ?

A:

If you can move to ubunut 14.04 or 16.04 and to ros-indigo or kinect you can use the folowing ros_qtc_pluggin  to use qtcreator for ros developpement. It's quite simple to install and use
