Q:

turtlebot simulator for fuerte

I have a newly-acquired turtlebot.  I have installed ROS fuerte on the turtlebot netbook and an ubuntu base computer, both running Ubuntu 10.04.  All has been going well so far with the actual robot. I would like to experiment with the turtlebot simulator, as well, but the installation instructions are all for ROS electric.  Is there a working simulator version for fuerte yet?
Thanks!

A:

yes there is a working simulator for fuerte you should be able to use all the same commands. I've filed a ticket to get those instructions updated here: http://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/trac/ticket/145
