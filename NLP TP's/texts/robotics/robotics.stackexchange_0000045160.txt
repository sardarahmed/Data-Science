What's the output of roslaunch state_publisher.launch? Does it throw any errors? Also, please format shell output and code (mark it and press Ctrl-k).
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-10-23:
The output of roslaunch looks ok. What exactly is the error message you get? What's the problem with rviz? Also please provide a link to the tutorial.

A:

From the tutorial:

Run rviz, choosing odom as your fixed frame. Add a Robot Model and TF.

According to the global status error in rviz, it seems like you didn't select odom as fixed frame in rviz.
