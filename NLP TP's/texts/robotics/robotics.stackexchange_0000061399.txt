Q:

ResourceNotFound when launching [robot]_moveit_config launch_file

Hi,
This is a test I created for a customized robot, say DENSO vp6242, which is not available in the original ROS package. This package I create is vp6242_config (according to tutorial, this should be vp6242_moveit_config) with some configurations and Moveit Setup Assistant packge
I'm not certain about how to register this customized package but I used .bashrc and double checked with roscd, rospack find and both recognized vp6242_config package.
However, when I run
roslaunch moveit_planning_execution.launch 

the error is returned

ResourceNotFound: [vp6242_config]

Does ResourceNotFound  mean any other error?
Thanks!

A:

However, when I run
roslaunch moveit_planning_execution.launch

Is this an actual copy/paste of the command you run? What happens when you execute:
roslaunch vp6242_config moveit_planning_execution.launch
