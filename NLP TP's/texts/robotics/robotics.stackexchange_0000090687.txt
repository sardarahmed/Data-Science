Q:

Can TransformListener get the transformation of an indirect child

I am using a tf::TransformListener listener to get the transformation between two frame in my c++ program.
My tf Tree is as follow Parent -> Child1 ->Child2  .
I am using the following line to get the transformation between Parent  to Child1:
listener.lookupTransform(frame_parent, frame_child1, ros::Time(0), transform);

When I am displaying the /tf topic with rostopic echo /tf, I can see a transformation for Parent -> Child1 and a transformation from Child1 -> Child2.
My question is, can I get the transformation from Parent -> Child2 ?  Can the TransformListener return a combination  of transformations ?
I wrote something like this:
listener.lookupTransform(frame_parent, frame_child2, ros::Time(0), transform);

A:

In short: yes, it can.
In fact: you can lookup transforms from any frame in your tree to any other frame in the tree, both forward and inverse. Doesn't matter how many intermediate frames there are.
This is one of the things that makes TF such a useful library (if it couldn't, it would essentially be just a very convoluted transformation matrix hashmap).
