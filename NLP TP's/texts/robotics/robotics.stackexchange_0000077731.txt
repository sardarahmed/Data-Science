Q:

'rosdep update' sporadically working (Ubuntu 14.04, indigo, ARM)

Installing indigo arm on jetson tegra tk1 using these instructions: (http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu).
I am at 'rosdep update' and it fails sporadically at different points.
I have tried reinstalling indigo.
I can resolve DNS/IP fine, and almost every file has both succeeded or failed.
I have tried to purge, update, reinstall rosdep (yes rosdep --version and apt-cache policy are the same).
Here is an example 2 runs:
RUN 1:
Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.10.40-gdacac96 armv7l)

I did this as an example while I was running this and it was the furthest it has ever gotten.
Should I just wait for sunny days in the future where I will get lucky and everything will work? I would also like to note that the views on forum items with "rosdep update" all have >300 views so I am seeing an issue with this delivery method.
I also successfully dual-booted ubuntu 14.04 and installed indigo on a Mac last night at ~2 am so maybe I will wait for 2 am to come around.

A:

Github had a fairly substantial outage today that may have contributed to this: https://status.github.com/messages/2016-12-07
