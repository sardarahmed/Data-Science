Q:

Illegal instruction (core dumped)

Hello all, I'm fairly unskilled when it comes to installing software on linux and I usually struggle with it. So I got excited when I finally got gazebo installed. However when I attempt to run it I get an illegal instruction error. By running gdb I was able to see that this is caused by code in gazebo::common::Time::Set(double) () from /usr/lib/libgazebo_common.so.1. Does anybody have an idea on how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Additional info
I am running Ubuntu.
Description:    Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS
Release:    12.04
Codename:   precise
I had to manually build OGRE due to a missing Cg plugin. However I don't think this is related. It appears to load OGRE okay.
Here is the gdb session.
user@Azul:~$ gdb gzserver

Would you be able to compile gazebo in debug mode, and then post a back trace? Instructions for compiling gazebo in debug mode can be found here: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/help.

A:

Version 1.2 of gazebo should have this problem fixed.
