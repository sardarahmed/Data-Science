Q:

install dependencies on raspberry pi

Hi
I installed ros fuerte in my raspberry pi in which there is raspbian wheezy and all work fine.
Now i must use the raspberry to receive a stream video from a webcam and publish the images, but when i create the package, doesn't find the dependecies image_transport opencv and cv_bridge.
How can install its without reinstall ros?
thanks
