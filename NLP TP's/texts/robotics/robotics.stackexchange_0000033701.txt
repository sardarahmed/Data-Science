Q:

Compiling Rosrecord fails, Boost path problem

I followed these instructions by davids. Essentially symlinking and exporting new path to get around python3 troubles, and then rosinstall ...desktop(tried using gcc45 also). I have boost 1.47 in /usr/lib. The problem is filesystem-mt not being in 1.47, Rosrecord fails with:
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

A:

Symlinking libboost_filesystem.so.1.47.0 to libboost_filesystem-mt.so worked.
