Q:

Is there a way to visualize variables in real time?

I am looking for a way to plot or graph variables so I can visually see how the robot is interpreting data such as range finders.

Are you using just gazebo, or ROS based gazebo?
Comment by Erik Stoltenborg on 2012-11-21:
If so, broadcast the data to a topic, listin to it using something like matlab and plot it.

Maybe you can try rxplot or rviz on ROS.

A:

In the short term, rxplot is the best approach.
Alternatively, you can write a plugin that outputs data for use with gnuplot.
Gazebo will eventually get a plotting utility, but that will not happen for a few more months.
