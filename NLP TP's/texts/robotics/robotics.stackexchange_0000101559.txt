Q:

Move_base action doesn't come up while Sending Goals to the Navigation Stack!

Hi everyone!
I'm trying to use the code that sends goals to the navigation stack from this Link:
https://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/SendingSimpleGoals, while using Turtlebot3 simuliation, but without any success! i only get this response: Waiting for the move_base action to come up. I tried changing the move_base action name to move_base_simple but still nothing!
the thing is it worked as i tried it with a real Turtlebot3. I would be so grateful for any suggestion.

Hi again!
It was just a very NOOB mistake on my part, I didn't start the navigation stack, I started SLAM and wondered why it is not working!! in the end everything just fell into place.
