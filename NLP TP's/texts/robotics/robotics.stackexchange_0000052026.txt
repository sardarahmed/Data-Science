Q:

Raspberry Pi Desktop Build Error QT

I'm building the full desktop version of ROS on a raspberry pi following these instructions: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Raspbian/Source
Currently I am at step 6
I'm not sure what is causing the error, here is the build log:
[ 84%] Running SIP generator for qt_gui_cpp_sip Python bindings...
roovy/share/python_qt_binding/cmake/shiboken_helper.cmake:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGeneratorRunner.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "GeneratorRunner", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GeneratorRunner"
  with any of the following names:

    GeneratorRunnerConfig.cmake
    generatorrunner-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GeneratorRunner" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "GeneratorRunner_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "GeneratorRunner" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.

I did manage to find one thread on this, but it was left unanswered. Does anyone recognize the error, and know how to fix it? Thanks!
UPDATE:
I managed to get a slightly different error after I ran
sudo apt-get install qt-sdk

This is what I got:

A:

This might not be exactly what you are looking for, but qt_gui_cpp has been built for RPi on ROS Groovy, it is available in a repository, you will find details about it on the following page: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Raspbian
I would only advise you to build from source what you can not find in this binary repository, e.g. dry packages, especially since it takes a lot of time and is more error-prone.

Sounds like a better idea. For the time being I've moved over to an ubuntu VM so I can learn how to use ROS. Once I go to deploy it I'll take this approach to getting it running on the RPi. Thanks!
