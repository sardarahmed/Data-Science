Q:

Not able to install ROS on ubuntu 14.04.3

I tried following the regular procedure but stuck at :-
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-dev-lts-utopic mesa-common-dev-lts-utopic libxatracker-dev-lts-utopic libopenvg1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgles1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgbm-dev-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic

A:

Your question needs a bit more explanation. Did you experience dependency issues while installing ROS?
The regular procedure is to skip sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-dev-lts-utopic mesa-common-dev-lts-utopic libxatracker-dev-lts-utopic libopenvg1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgles1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgbm-dev-lts-utopic libegl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic if you do not have dependency issues while ROS installation. There is a clear warning on the installation page which says "If you are using Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.2 and experience dependency issues during the ROS installation, you may have to install some additional system dependencies. Do not install these packages if you are using 14.04, it will destroy your X server "
After sudo apt-get update you can proceed to sudo apt-get install ros-xxx-desktop-full (replace xxx with indigo or jade depending on what distro you want to install) and if you have any dependency issues during this stage, you can go back to fixing the dependencies.
