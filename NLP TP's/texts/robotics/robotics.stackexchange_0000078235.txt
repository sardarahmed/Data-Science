Q:

Import error: no module named Num.msg

Hi,
I want to use my own msg, and try this:
from Num.msg import *
and get the import error. Num.msg is in /msg/ and is found by "rosmsg show". When I don't import, codeline "a = Num()" gets error "Global name 'Num' is not defined". What do I miss?
Thanks,
hvn

A:

The python package for messages is named after the ROS package name, not the message name.
This means that the import syntax for a single message is:
from my_package.msg import MyMessage

Or for all messages in a package:
from my_package.msg import *

It looks like you should change Num to your package name. (note that package and message names are case-sensitive)

Based on your other question ; the import should be from robot_pi.msg import Num or from robot_pi.msg import *

Ok, I've changed its name to robot_pi.msg, leaving its content intact: [code]int32[] data[/code]
Now I want to this for publishing: pub=rospy.Publisher('speaker', int32, queue_size=10)  a=robot_pi()  a.data=[1,2,3] and still get the errors. Where do I go wrong?

The message name is Num, so use that when you create the publisher.

I changed Num.msg into robot_pi.msg and changed CMakelists.txt accordingly. New robot_pi.msg doesn't contain Num but "int32[] data". So how is the message name Num? I assume create the publisher is pub = rospy... so int32 should be replaced by the message name?

Ok, if you're renamed your message file (that wasn't clear from your previous post), then the message name is now robot_pi.
