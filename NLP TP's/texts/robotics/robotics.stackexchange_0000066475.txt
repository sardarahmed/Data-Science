Q:

Package location after catkin_make install

Hi,
I am working with my version of the ros_arduino_bridge package and I am having some problems with the install. I forked it from github into my ~/catkin_ws/src folder and then ran catkin_make install from ~/catkin_ws/ . When I run roslaunch ros_arduino_python arduino.launch
lukas@lukas-Inspiron-N7010:~$ roslaunch ros_arduino_python arduino.launch

... logging to /home/lukas/.ros/log/0853208e-ce73-11e4-8f0d-1c659d0cfa61/roslaunch-lukas-Inspiron-N7010-6050.log

Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.

Press Ctrl-C to interrupt

Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

error loading <rosparam> tag:
        file does not exist [/home/lukas/catkin_ws/src/ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_python/config/my_arduino_params.yaml]
XML is <rosparam command="load" file="$(find ros_arduino_python)/config/my_arduino_params.yaml"/>
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Now I know from previous testing that the problem is that I haven't specified the full path to the .yaml file. So I need to modify the my_arduino_params.yaml file. Here is my problem: When I roscd to the package there is nothing in the folder except for a CMakeLists.txt and a package.xml file. Now I may just be a noob but could some knowledgable sage enlighten me as to where catkin stores these files?
Thanks,
luketheduke

Did you write install rules for your yaml file?

What do you mean by "install rules"

A:

I forked it from github into my ~/catkin_ws/src folder and then ran catkin_make install from ~/catkin_ws/.

And then you did source ~/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash?

Now I know from previous testing that the problem is that I haven't specified the full path to the .yaml file.

No, you don't and you shouldn't. If you sourced the correct workspace, the ros_arduino_python pkg should be on the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and roslaunch / rospack should be able to resolve the $(find ros_arduino_python) to the proper location.

When I roscd to the package there is nothing in the folder except for a CMakeLists.txt and a package.xml file.

That is probably in ~/catkin_ws/install/share/PKG_NAME?
Also:

file does not exist [/home/lukas/catkin_ws/src/ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_python/config/my_arduino_params.yaml]

Is there actually a my_arduino_params.yaml in /home/lukas/catkin_ws/src/ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_python/config/?

My bad I was roscding into the wrong package ros_arduino_bridge instead of ros_arduino_python. Thanks for your help!
