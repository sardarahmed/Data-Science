Q:

What node can do CMVision blob tracking?

I got CMVision blob tracking to work (Ubuntu 10.04 & Diamond ROS), now I could really use a node to read subscribe to the published blobs, and publish R/C servo camera tracking.
I've started to write a node, and I've studied the headers, but it's not clear to me what structure I need for the blobs.  If I can subscribe to the blobs, I can work out the centroid of the biggest blob or two, and then probably publish a servo command to the ros_arduino_bridge.
Surely there is already a node to read the blobs that I can use or study!
Thanks,

A:

Do you mean CMVision was running locally, or in ROS already?  There is a node here:
http://wiki.ros.org/cmvision
And a tutorial here:

I'm not sure if that is what you are asking though.
