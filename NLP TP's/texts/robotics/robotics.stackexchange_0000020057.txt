Q:

Problem defining rotation matrix

I am studying robotic kinematics , and given the following manipulator with its D-H frames assigned:

I have to find the rotation matrix $R_{e}^{2}$, which is the rotation matrix of frame $e$ with respect to frame $2$.
I know that this matrix is :
$\begin{pmatrix}
0 &sin\beta   & cos\beta \\ 
 0& cos\beta & -sin\beta\\ 
-1 &0  &0 
\end{pmatrix}$
but I cannot understand why.
Can somebody please help me understand how does this reotation matrix comes out?

A:

It looks like both frames are attached to the end effector at point P, and are offset by a constant angle $\beta$. So you don't really have to consider the D-H parameters to answer this question - just do a simple rotation matrix evaluation.
So how are the frames, $F_2$ = $[\hat{x_2} \; \hat{y_2} \; \hat{z_2}]^T$ and $F_e$ = $[\hat{x_e} \; \hat{y_e} \; \hat{z_e}]^T$, related? Well, from the diagram you have above, we have the following relationships:
$$\hat{x_2} = \cos\beta \hat{y_e} + sin\beta \hat{z_e}$$
$$\hat{y_2} = \cos\beta \hat{y_e} - sin\beta \hat{z_e}$$
$$\hat{z_2} = -\hat{x_e}$$
Note that $\hat{x_e}$ points into the page and $\hat{z_2}$ points out of the page.
Then do you see how your rotation matrix above falls out of that? Clearly,
$$F_2 = R_e^2F_e$$
