Q:

Problem in rosnode

In rgbdslam package, I wrote a '--.cpp' file and built a node from that file. I often used to edited the cpp file and rebuilt the package. But later on I changed the name of the node to be built and deleted the old node manually (from the bin folder). Building the package was successful. When I run new node, and check it using
$ rosnode list
It shows the name of old node which I deleted and cannot find the name of the new node in the list.
When I tried,
$ rosnode info (name of the new node)
It reports as unknown node.
Any suggestions how to solve this problem?
And thanks in advance for your suggestions

A:

A node's name is set by using the __name:=my_node_name parameter or, if the parameter is not specified by the name you pass in the call to ros::init. Note that roslaunch always wants a node name specified in launch files and uses the __name parameter internally.

I mentioned the node name in cmakelists.txt as
rosbuild_add_executable(newnode src/new.cpp).
I run the node from $ rosrun pkg_name newnode.
The problem is I cannot find the newnode in the list of running nodes. When I tried info about the newnode it reports as unknown node.

The binary name has nothing to do with the node name as it appears in rosnode list. As i said, it's only determined by the name passed to ros::init or the __name parameter.
