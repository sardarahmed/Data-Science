Q:

Baby Child Following Robot

I am Planning to make a crawling bot which will follow a baby,having a pillow on the board.The Problem with the project is:
Suppose a case when the baby falls, the bot should come exactly at the place where the baby's head will hit the ground?
Any idea of how i can make the bot move to that point before the baby's head hit the ground ?

A:

Start first with a robot that can "come exactly at the place" where you throw a ball.
Once you have that, you will gain experience necessary to create the other phase of the project (going towards the baby).
Start simple, then make it more complicated.
Start with a four-wheeled robot (or maybe three-wheeled).
