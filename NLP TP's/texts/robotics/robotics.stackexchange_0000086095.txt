Q:

when should I create a new workspace

I just finished beginner tutorials. In the tutorial, we create a catkin_ws. Now I am trying to do some further projects, but I have no idea that do I need to create a new workspace for new project or just create new package in old workspace.

A:

I don't believe there is a single "best" answer to this: some people like to keep all of their packages in a single workspace, others like to group packages that they use for particular projects into separate workspaces.
Neither is necessarily better than the other.
Personally I keep separate workspaces for just about everything, and use workspace overlaying whenever I need certain packages in other workspaces.

Edit:

Thank you for answering. So if I keep all packages in one workspace, whenever I use catkin_make to build packages, it will build all my packages, but usually I don't really need other packages.

That could be one reason to have multiple workspaces, yes.
On the other hand, catkin_tools supports profiles that allow you to configure black and whitelists. If you'd want, you could have a workspace with 1000 packages, while still only building 3 of them (for instance).

That's been my reason for using catkin_tools. I have that one repo with a lot of packages some broken that I don't need. Catkin build only build the ones I need :)
