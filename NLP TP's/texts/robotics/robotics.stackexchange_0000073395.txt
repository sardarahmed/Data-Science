A:

You can't publish multiple data types to a single topic. What you need to do is publish multiple topics from a single node.

Thanks Nicholas for replying, I am reading an arduino mega board by ros. I have string, integer and float data coming from arduino and I want to print all data in one terminal. But I can see only one type of data in one terminal by rostopic echo. How can I do this ? I am new to ROS.

You could make a custom message that holds a string, integer, and float. Populate that message type in your node and publish it.

Hi Nicholas I made header file for string and integer data type as you said. Now I am having another issue I posted here :link text
