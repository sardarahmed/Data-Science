Q:

"No source available for main()" while debugging in Eclipse IDE

Hi,
I'm new to ros groovy and using catkin. I created a workspace, a catkin package with catkin_create_pkg and an eclipse project with catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles". Now in my workspace I have the src, devel and build folder and I can run the program in eclipse IDE. Therefore I need to choose "Run configurations" -> Created new Launch and browsed the binary. But if I try to debug it, eclipse doesn't show the source code, if it stops at a breakpoint and I just get No source available for main().
Does anyone have a solution?

A:

Ok, found the solution. Would be nice if this maybe could be a hint in the tutorial for beginners like me ;)
Just cd to build directory and then use
cmake ../src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Now in Eclipse degugging should work.

I'm not familiar with using Eclipse, but it would be nice if you added a note for eclipse users on what ever tutorial you were following.

Hi joq and William, I followed the catkin tutorials http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/Tutorials and http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs .Here in section "2.2 Catkin-y Approach" is a link to http://answers.ros.org/question/52013/catkin-and-eclipse/ but didn't realized thats also the solution for my problem.

@Sonne I have looked everywhere for this answer.  THANK YOU!!!!!  I am new to CMake and I'm trying to debug a project in Eclipse that is build with CMake.  Your command did the trick.  :-)
