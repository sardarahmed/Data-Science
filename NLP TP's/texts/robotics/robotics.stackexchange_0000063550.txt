Q:

How to use the keyboard teleop for programs written in C

I am trying to add keyboard support to some programs written in C++. How would I subscribe to that topic and listen for certain keys?

A:

Most of the existing teleop nodes don't publish key events; they interpret the keybaord events and publish some sort of command - usually velocity commands for moving a mobile base.
If you want to add keyboard support for an existing program, you'll probably have to do it the old-fashioned way - by reading  stdin.
