Q:

GPG error on Debian

Hi
I followed below link
http://wiki.ros.org/lunar/Installation/Debian
But when I run below command:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

Error comes:
mucip@debian-ev:~$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
Executing: /tmp/apt-key-gpghome.YxA1unHkRT/gpg.1.sh --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
gpg: connecting dirmngr at '/tmp/apt-key-gpghome.YxA1unHkRT/S.dirmngr' failed: IPC connect call failed
gpg: keyserver receive failed: No dirmngr
mucip@debian-ev:~$

What is the problem?...
Regards,

Please use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) to format console copy-pastes. That makes them much easier to read.
Thanks.

Hi,
After than Gvdhoorn's answer. I googled little bitr more. I installed below packets;
su
sudo apt-get install gnupg
sudo apt-get install dirmngr

Than redo below code,
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key s421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

Than now everything fine again... ;-)
