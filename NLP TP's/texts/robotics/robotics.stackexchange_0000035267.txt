Q:

RVIZ Message Filter Queue Size

I have a setup where my pose information is greatly delayed ~0.5s from my PointCloud data.  Because of this, my TF timestamps lag behind by about the same 0.5s.
When I attempt to visualize this in RVIZ, the queue size is only 10 messages.  Since my laser data publishes much faster than that, I drop 100% of message since I would need a queue of ~40 messages to receive enough messages to transform them successfully.
Does RVIZ have a parameter. config, or setting for changing the MessageFilters queue size?
Also, if I use topic tools throttle, I can reduce the rate of incoming messages, prevent the queue from filling up, and then display around 5 to 10 messages per second.  This isn't an ideal work around though.

Hmmm, I got luckier with Googling, and I found this response:
http://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20100726.173011.b343a0f5.gl.html
And there's the hardcoded value of 10 in PointCloud2 display on line 51.

Is there a way to change this dynamically or should I recompile RVIZ/make my own plugin?
If there isn't a way to change this, let me know, and I'll file a ticket.

This definitely looks like a good enhancement ticket for rviz.
