Q:

slam and virtual environment?

I wanna know if this feasible. In the client side, I have a virtual environment where the slave is considered as a point that populates the virtual environment. In this environment, there are some fixed obstacles, so the slave will send the current position of the point as well as the positions of the obstacles. Based on the aforementioned data, I will visualize a map in the master side. Where should I start if this possible?

A:

The short answer is "yes, this is possible."
It's hard to give a better answer without knowing more details of your system. What do you already have working? Are you starting from scratch? Have you worked through the basic ROS tutorials?

@lindzey,
Thanks for the quick reply. I'm really struggling with ROS and to set up Phantom Omni in Ubuntu. It is really pain in the neck. At least now I want to acquaint my self with SLAM in general. I came across MRPT library. My question is how can I fake the positions of virtual obstacles?

I will be more than happy if I implement simple SLAM whether by using ROS or MRPT. I'm reading probabilistic robotics book, however there is nothing about the practical stuff.
