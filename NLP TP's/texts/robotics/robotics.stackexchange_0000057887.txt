Q:

Motorized midi fader BCF2000 driver

Does anyone know where I can get a copy of the bcf2000_driver?
This was originally mentioned in the question here "answers.ros.org/question/33234/looking-for-a-usb-mixer-ros-interface/?answer=33304#post-id-33304", that points to the now deprecated "kforge.ros.org/sandbox/bcf2000_driver".
Thanks,
ioannis

A:

As kforge is no more, I quickly cooked up a new bcf2000 driver as I could not find the old one anywhere...
You can get a copy of the driver here: github.com/ihavoutis/bcf2000.git
cheers
