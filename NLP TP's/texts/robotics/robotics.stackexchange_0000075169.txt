I remember having some issues with openCV 3 dependencies when I first got the Zed camera working in my setup. I can't remember exactly how I got around them, but the cv_bridge package sticks in my memory. I'll see if I can find how I fixed it.

Hello Safaa,
I am using the ZED with my Jetson TX1 since a while now. When you follow the tutorial, make sure you install the dependencies listed:

roscpp
rosconsole
sensor_msgs
opencv2
cv_bridge
image_transport

If these are ROS packages these can be installed via your systems package manager. EG on ubuntu you can run:
sudo apt-get install ros-DISTRO-roscpp ros-DISTRO-rosconsole ros-DISTRO-sensor-msgs ros-DISTRO-cv-bridge ros-DISTRO-image-transport

Be sure to replace DISTRO with your ROS distribution, eg indigo or kinetic. By the looks of it you are missing:
sudo apt-get install ros-DISTRO-image-transport
