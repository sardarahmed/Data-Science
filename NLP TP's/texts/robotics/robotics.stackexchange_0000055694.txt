Q:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [footstep_planner/footstep_planner_node] (updated)

hi,
i want to run "footstep_planner_complete.launch" node in humanoid_navigation stack, but this error appears into my terminal:
"ERROR: cannot launch node of type [footstep_planner/footstep_planner_node]: can't locate node [footstep_planner_node] in package [footstep_planner]"
rviz window opens but the planner does not work due to that error.
besides my ros version is Groovy!.

A:

it seems that Some Dependencies were missing and those packages were not install by default!
this is My Solution:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-octomap*
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-geometr*
sudo apt-get install pkg*
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-sbpl
after all, because installing libcul4-gnutls-dev automatically remove rviz !!!(WHY ON EARTH??):
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-desktop-full
now :
roslaunch footstep_planner footstep_planner_complete.launch
