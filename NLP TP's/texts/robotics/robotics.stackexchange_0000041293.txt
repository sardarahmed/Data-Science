Q:

ros as root - common bug, when workspace is in /home/user/ros_workspace

Hey guys,
I tried to run some ROS-Packages as root and got this:

Warning: error while crawling
/home/username:
boost::filesystem::status: Permission
denied: "/home/username/.gvfs"

According to some google research, this is a common bug - somehow .gvfs denies any access for anyone who is not the user.
My setup of shell&environment was absolutly fine, once I copied the workspace to another path(/home/ros_workspace) there was no problem :-)
This is no real question, but I thought it might be helpful to mention this problem.

Probably best to file a bug instead: http://www.ros.org/wiki/Tickets

A:

Why are you running ROS packages as root from the workspace of another user?
That is likely that actual problem.

Because I thought it would be useful in that situation ;-) and the system has one user(me) and root...usually root should have access to everything which it has not, so I reported this.

Good to be aware of. The message is "don't run as root", and especially "don't build anything as root".
