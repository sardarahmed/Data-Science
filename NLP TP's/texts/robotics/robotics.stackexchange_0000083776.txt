Q:

rospy equivalent of ROS_*_NAMED

I came across a blog post about modifying the settings for logging. In the post, the ROS_WARN_NAMED function was mentioned. I hadn't seen that before and thought that it would be useful if there's a rospy equivalent. I tried searching for it, but didn't find anything (which makes me believe that this doesn't exist for rospy).
Is there a rospy equivalent of the ROS_*_NAMED family of logging functions? Any release of ROS will do.

A:

There are no convenience wrappers for this afaik (so no rospy.loginfo_named(..) or similar), but rospy does support named loggers since ros/ros_comm#948.
They would be used like so (taken from the unit test):
rospy.loginfo("test child logger 1", logger_name="log1")

Note: this is only available on Lunar and Kinetic (backported in ros/ros_comm#1205) not on Kinetic ("new feature, not backported").
