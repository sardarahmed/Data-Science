Q:

How can I change the robot's max velocity programmatically?

Hello,
I would like to change the max_vel_x parameter programmatically, at runtime to increase or decrease the speed of the robot, based on environmental conditions.  Is this possible with the TrajectoryPlannerROS base local planner?
I am using the SimpleActionClient API to send goal locations to the robot.  For some of these goals, I would like to be able to also decrease the maximum speed.
Thanks in advance,
Charles

After some more investigation, I learned that I can use the dynamic_reconfigure tool, and that it has a command line.  While not an elegant solution, I could execute a system command from my code, i.e. rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam set /robot_0/move_base/TrajectoryPlannerROS max_vel_x 0.1

A:

I asked something similar about a C++ API for a dynamic reconfigure client here and Pablo gave a good answer for how to get around the lack of such an API. He suggested using the service
/my_node/set_parameters

with topics
/my_node/parameter_descriptions-
/my_node/parameter_updates-

That service and those topics are provided by the dynamic reconfigure server.
