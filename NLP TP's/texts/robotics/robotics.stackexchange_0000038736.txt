Q:

installation of perception_pcl_electric_unstable

Recently I am dealing with surface reconstruction using pcl, and I need the OctreePointCloudSearch class under pcl::octree. But the default pcl version under perception_pcl is only 1.1, and classes like OctreePointCloudSearch are missing in this version.
So following the discussion from this thread,
http://answers.ros.org/question/11622/how-do-you-upgrade-pcl-to-the-current-release
I download perception_pcl_electric_unstable from
http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_electric_unstable/
and rosmake it. Unfortunately I have no idea how to get rid of the following error,
"......
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpcl_range_image_border_extractor
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[3]: *** [../bin/convert_pcd_to_image] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/robot/ros/perception_pcl/pcl_ros/build'
......"
My current setting: ubuntu 11.04 + ros electric
You advice is greatly appreciated.

Hey i noticed that you haven't set your ros path for this unstable version before compiling it. I see "/home/robot/ros/perception_pcl/pcl_ros/build" in your error which is not unstable version. I have recently updated my unstable version in similar environment and it works fine

I even had a bug in flann and reported the solution to the developer which was updated instantaneously.  Could you do "svn info" and tell the version you checked out.

Karthik, the reason that the folder name is shown as perception_pcl rather than "perception_pcl_electric_unstable" just because I changed the folder name after svn the source. BTW, svn info gives "Revision: 241"

Clark: I have answered your question. I tried it on other system n was able to recreate your issue, I was able to solve it in the explained fashion.

A:

Hello!
A colleague of mine had the same problem some days ago. You need to
remove the compiler libary flag "-lpcl_range_image_border_extractor" in the manifest.xml.  That library doesnt exist anymore because it was merged with another one. :) Then it should compile properly.
Greets,
