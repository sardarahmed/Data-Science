Q:

How to scale the window in plan visualization?

I followed PlanVis.
I run:
  svn co http://code.in.tum.de/pubsvn/knowrob/tags/latest knowrob
  rosmake
  rosrun rosprolog rosprolog mod_vis
  register_ros_package(knowrob_actions).
  owl_parse('/opt/ros/electric/stacks/knowrob/knowrob_actions/owl/serve_drink.owl', false, false, true).
  planvis_create(Pv).
  planvis_load('http://www.roboearth.org/kb/serve_drink.owl#ServeADrink',$Pv).
  

And it shows:

How to scale the window (in this example is serve a drink) which my cursor pointed?
It's too big to show in one screen.
Thank you~

Sorry, but how to scale windows is no ROS-related problem. The visualization window can be scaled using whatever mechanism your window manager supports (maximize to screen, drag the border with the mouse to resize, ...)

What I mean is not the Java program's window. I means the inside 'serve a drink' window. Can I scale it? I can't find any way to scale. Thank you~

You can't scale it, but you can shift it around holding the right mouse button pressed.

Yeah, I found I only can move it. Is there any way to scale it or how to patch it? Thank you~
