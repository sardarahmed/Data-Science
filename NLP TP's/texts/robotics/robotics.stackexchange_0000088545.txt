Q:

How to read ros log file?

Recently, I write a .launch file. But when I roslaunch it, I get the info as is shown below.
roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation multiple_navigation.launch 
... logging to /home/ise-admin/.ros/log/e4e33fd6-a16d-11e8-841a-509a4c311940/roslaunch-ise-linux-1-5449.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 29, column 83
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

In order to find out where are the errors, I hope to open the log file.
cd `roslaunch-logs`
ls
first_tb3-amcl-4-stdout.log         roslaunch-ise-linux-1-3015.log
map_server-2-stdout.log             roslaunch-ise-linux-1-32614.log

roslaunch-ise-linux-1-27793.log     third_tb3-amcl-8-stdout.log

It seems that the log file is temporary, right?

A:

Maybe it is in ~/.ros/log.
For seeing more information with roslaunch you can try roslaunch -v <package-name> <launch-name> to request verbosity output.
However, when I had the same error, the problem was a non-printing character in the file.
You can try to confirm by looking at a binary dump of the file with hexdump -C mylaunch.launch.
Delete these characters works for me.
