Q:

roslaunch python

Hello,
I'm trying to write a launch file for my python program. My program is named search.py and is located in searching_tobot/src. Here is my launch file so far :
<launch>

<group ns="robot0">
<node name="search" pkg="searching_tobot" type="search" output="screen">
  </node>
</group>

<group ns="robot1">
<node name="search" pkg="searching_tobot" type="search" output="screen">
  </node>
</group>

</launch>

However I have this error :
core service [/rosout] found
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [searching_tobot/search]: can't locate node [search] in package [searching_tobot]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [searching_tobot/search]: can't locate node [search] in package [searching_tobot]

And I can't find what I'm doing wrong. I tried replacing search by search.py with no luck
I'm used to do launch file with C++ executable and I'm a bit of a newbie with python on ROS and I couldn't find the answer and the wiki :S. Thanks a lot !

A:

I am not sure if who have to use search or search.py (I believe the latter or both work) but one should work. My guess is your script file is not executable. Go to your searching_tobot/src and run
chmod +x search.py

You need to use whatever the file is called, so probably search.py.
