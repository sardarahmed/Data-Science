Please provide some details -- installation method (binary/source), output of locate libgazebo_common.so and env | grep -i gazebo. Though, it may be sufficient to run sudo ldconfig in some cases...

A:

Looks like some environment variables are missing/wrong. In case you didn't change the CMAKE_INSTALLATION_PREFIX you have to source the setup.sh file from /usr/local/share/gazebo-1.4/. If gazebo is installed in another folder, then you need to add the following lines to your .bashrc:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<install_path>/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=&lt;install_path&gt;/local/bin:$PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<install_path>/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
source <install_path>/share/gazebo-1.4/setup.sh

where <install_path> is the same with CMAKE_INSTALLATION_PREFIX specified during build configuration (see Step 10 in Wiki). After that reopen the terminal or manualy source the .bashrc with
$ source .bashrc

But when I close the terminal and try to launch gazebo again I get the same error message. So each time I have to source it. Since I am using the default directory /usr/local , I use the 2nd command given in Step 10 in wiki. How can I get this solved ?

Simply add source /usr/local/share/gazebo-1.4/setup.sh to the end of your ~/.bashrc file.

I also have the same problem, this the location of my instalation files LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gazebo-1.8/plugins:/usr/local/lib/gazebo-1.8/plugins:
GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/local/share/gazebo-1.8:/usr/local/share/gazebo_models
GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11345
GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gazebo-1.8/plugins
GAZEBO_MODEL_DATABASE_URI=http://gazebosim.org/models I have followed the answer but I still get the error: gazebo: error while loading shared libraries: libgazebo_com
