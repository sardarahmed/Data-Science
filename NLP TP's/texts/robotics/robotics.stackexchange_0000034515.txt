Q:

Stereoscopic camera with RGBDSLAM

I used stereoscopic camera (calibrated) produce pointcloud images.
Can I mimic these messages as Kinect output messages so I can use RGBDSLAM to generate 3D model?

A:

Yes. RGBDSLAM requires the point cloud, and (IIRC) the grayscale camera image; all you'll need to do is get the topic names right, and you should be good to go.
