Q:

tracked robot Gazebo-ROS

hello, I'm trying to create a simulator in gazebo under ROS, for a robot base. This robot base has tracked wheels. I would like to ask you how to implement them in ros and Gazebo, in particular:

is there any kind of specific transmission ?
do I have to build the urdf xacro in a particular way ?
is there any kind of example (I didn't find it from my own)?

thanks in advance

A:

Now there is official support for tracked robots in Gazebo 9 and 11 using ODE. Check out https://github.com/osrf/gazebo/blob/gazebo11/worlds/tracked_vehicle_simple.world for usage example.

As this is now the answer, I've marked it as the answer instead of my earlier one.

@gvdhoorn @peci1 Thank you for this solution. I was able to run the demo. But i am unable to implement the plugin on my robot design. Could anyone of you help me do it? I added the keyboardGUI and simple tracked vehicle plugin. But its not working in my case. My robot isn't moving. For a note, my robot design is in urdf xacro format

@pranshu It'd be best if you created a new question here where you post your whole Xacro file and the process you make an SDF from it.
