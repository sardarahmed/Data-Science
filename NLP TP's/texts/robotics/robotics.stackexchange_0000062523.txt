Q:

Function of "gazebo_ros_camera"?

Related to the answer to this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/192057/grab-single-frame-from-gazebo-camera/.
I'm trying to write a C++ program that will allow me to capture a single frame from a camera in Gazebo and will be basing it on gazebo_ros_camera based on advice from that answer. Can someone explain to me what exactly is gazebo_ros_camera supposed to do? The source code documentation didn't really explain it, and the ROS wiki page only mentions it in passing in various places.

A:

In a nutshell, it generates a simulated camera image by rendering the Gazebo world from the simulated cameraÂ´s viewpoint (using methods provided by the core gazebo code) and publishes the data according to standard ROS conventions to ROS topics (as described in REP 135).

I see, thanks. Is it possible to write a modified version that generates an image from an actual camera in the environment, then?

Yes, you could make a version that publishes only single images. Not sure how easy it is to only generate single images via the Gazebo API, but I expect that is possible.
