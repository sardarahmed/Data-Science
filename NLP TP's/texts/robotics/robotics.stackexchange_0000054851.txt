Q:

rqt plugin not listed/found in list returned by "rqt --list-plugins"

I am writing a rqt plugin (ROS Hydro, Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS, x86_64) at moment following the rqt tutorial: Create your new plugin.
Unfortunately, my plugin is not in the list returned by "rqt --list-plugins". rosrun also fails.
$ cd ~/rqt_ws/
$ catkin_make
$ rosrun rqt_mypkg rqt_mypkg
qt_gui_main() found no plugin matching "rqt_mypkg"

I'm having the same issue using ROS Groovy.  Everything builds and installs properly, but I can't run the plug-in. I can even open and build it without issue in QT Creator.  I'm currently running off of the binary packages.  Any advice?

A:

Appears to be a problem with rqt caching the locations of plugins in its config and not updating that info. A workaround that works for me is delete that cache and restart rqt:
$ rm ~/.config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini
$ rqt

A 2nd workaround: this appears to work using the latest rqt source (groovy-devel branch, which is also used to build the hydro packages), so this looks like a bug in the released packages as opposed to a problem with the tutorial. I added the following to my hydro workspace:
- git: {local-name: qt_gui_core, uri: 'git@github.com:ros-visualization/qt_gui_core.git'}
- git: {local-name: rqt, uri: 'git@github.com:ros-visualization/rqt.git'}
- git: {local-name: rqt_common_plugins, uri: 'git@github.com:ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins.git'}

and a new plugin was found and ran.

I have the same setup as the initiator (ROS Hydro, Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS, x86_64) and face exactly the same problem.
Also overlaying the proposed meta-packages did not solve the problem.

This might be a bug. Follow this issue for details: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt/issues/90 .

I am having the same problem. When you say you've added this to your hydro workspace, how exactly is that done. I am working in ROS Groovy.

If you follow the bug in question, the fix for this is to add the --force-discover option when running rqt.

Just want to say thank you ! I even tried to reinstall ros but doesn't work. Because the config file never been removed....
