A:

You can use catkin_create_qt_pkg. But it will probably generate some project which is not compileable (or at least in was like it my case). It depends on version of your ROS, qt etc.
Here is a great tutorial on how to do that. But in my case I had to modify it's CMakeLists.txt to be able to build it. I also had to rename QtGui include in main_window.hpp.
From this #include <QtGui/QMainWindow>
to this #include <QtWidgets/QMainWindow>.
I've added my example package here on github so take look.

For some reason its not working for Kinetic

I've tried this on kinetic so it should work imo. Have you followed the guide to make sure your qt is installed properly?

Hey l4ncelot, when trying to open your github example I can run catkin_make succesfully but when opening it in Qt I get:CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roscpp" ...
Can you help me?

Hey Valveware,
I used this package I found :
https://github.com/stonier/qt_ros
add it to your workspace. If you have questions let me know.
Thanks!

Does that work for Kinetic? I now did the following steps:

followed the installguide
cloned l4's example and qt_rosinto my source folder
ran catkin_make on my workspace ( no errors)
Qt -> open project -> catkin_ws/src/qtros_example/ CMakeLists.txt with the standard kit

Now the last step gives an error in Qt: CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "roscpp". What am I still doing wrong? Qt Creator 4.5.0 based on Qt 5.10.0. Thanks in advance!

Is this perhaps a better solution for me? https://answers.ros.org/question/275578/ros-kinetic-gui-help/ I also which to create a GUI to interact with a Turtlebot running on ROS. EDIT: Solved it with this thread thanks!
