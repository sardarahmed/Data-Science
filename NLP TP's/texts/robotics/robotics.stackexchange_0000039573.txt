Q:

How to solve 'unused args [old_kinect_frame]' problem?

I follow pr2_tabletop_manipulation_apps.
I run
 export ROBOT=sim
 roslaunch pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch      pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch

And I got:
 sam@sam:~$ export ROBOT=sim
 sam@sam:~$ roslaunch pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch      pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch
 ... logging to      /home/sam/.ros/log/d05d8cd2-8785-11e1-bf50-20cf30a23845/roslaunch-sam-1     6487.log
 Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.

How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

Sorry!  That bug has been fixed in Electric-branch, but not in our released version yet.  I'll do a release today to fix it in debians.  In the meantime, you can get the updated launch file by doing
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_object_manipulation/branches/0.5-branch/applications/pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch/launch
and then just replace the one you're using.
