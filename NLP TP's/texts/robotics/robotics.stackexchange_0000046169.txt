The binary doesn't seem to be present. Are you sure you built it using rosmake?
Comment by joseescobar60 on 2012-11-29:
no, i'm making it... Thank you!
Comment by joseescobar60 on 2012-11-29:
i get this error:
-- BUILD ERRORS: These must be resolved before compiling.
--    Missing: Google Protobuf (libprotobuf-dev)
--    Missing: Google Protobuf Compiler Library (libprotoc-dev)
--    Missing: libtar
-- END BUILD ERRORS
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-29:
The error tells you that it could not find some libraries. Just install them: sudo apt-get install libprotoc-dev libtar-dev libprotobuf-dev libcegui-mk2-dev

i have to do the rosmake again???
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-29:
Sure. If the build failed you need to fix the problem and rebuild.

A:

First you'll have to check out the ROS stack for gazebo and put it into your ros workspace (instructions for setting up a workspace):
rosws set --svn simulator_gazebo https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_gazebo/trunk
rosws update

Then just build the stack with rosmake:
rosmake simulator_gazebo

If I'm reading the Gazebo CMakeLists.txt file correctly, it will use the development version from mercurial by default.

hello, i did what you say but how can i know which version of gazebo i have installed o where is installed this nwe version
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-29:
The new version is installed right in the ros package. roscd gazebo will jump to the gazebo package that is used and rospack find gazebo will show you the path. Note that you might need to re-compile gazebo plugins if there were ABI changes in the dev version of gazebo.
Comment by joseescobar60 on 2012-11-29:
i run gazebo but is the same version in the cmakelist file i have this: rosbuild_make_distribution(1.6.16), and the problem with the contact sensors is not fixed
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-29:
Sorry. I had a little mistake in my rosws command. Please edit the file $ROS_WORKSPACE/.rosinstall and fix the url of the gazebo repository. It should be the last line in that file. Then run rosws update and open a new terminal or re-source the setup.bash file in your overlay.

hello, i have a question, can i install any gazebo version for my ros fuerte?, because the version that i installed yesterday don't works very well and is too heavy for my hardware especifications...
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-30:
You can install whatever version you want. You just need to change the CMakeLists.txt file and the makefile that is used for downloading gazebo's source code manually.
Comment by joseescobar60 on 2012-11-30:
what version is the most estable??
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-11-30:
That I don't know. For me the default ROS gazebo in fuerte always worked perfectly fine.
Comment by joseescobar60 on 2012-11-30:
yes, but has problems with the contacsensor, thank you for everything...
Comment by Andrei Haidu on 2012-12-04:
after rosmake I get the following error:
Linking CXX shared library libgazebo_sdf_interface.so
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -l/usr/lib/libboost_thread-mt.so
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
And I have this library in usr/lib
