Q:

URDF limits differential robot

I'm creating a differential robot and for the wheels I'm using revolute joints. I don't understand the  property I have to add. More specifically the lower and upper fields, the effort and velocity are somewhat understandable. Should I just go yolo and add this to my robot?

A:

revolute joints are rotating joints with limits. You'll want to use a continuous joint, which is a rotating joint without limits (i.e. allowing continuous rotation). See also URDF joint wiki
