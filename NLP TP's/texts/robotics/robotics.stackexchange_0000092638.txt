Q:

Different between private node handler and not private

I'm using ROS melodic and Gazebo 9.9.0 on an Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.
I've been reading this: http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/NodeHandles, but I don't understand what is (or are) the different between this two declarations:
ros::NodeHandle n;

And
ros::NodeHandle n("~");

What are the different between a private and a not private node handler?

A:

The first will look for your parameter in the global namespace (ei it will find /my_param) the second will look under the nested namespaces of the node itself (ei it will find /namespace/my_node_name/my_param).
You can still find the local namespace copy of that parameter with the global nodehandle, but you will need to type in alot more information.
