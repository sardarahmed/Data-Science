Q:

command to return version of ur5

Simple question. How do I know which version of UR5 am I running? I am currently attempting to launch a moveit package for a UR5 arm but am running into issues launching the package because depending on the ur version that I am running I need to determine whether to be using the ur_driver or ur_modern_driver.
Some other forum explained:
For system versions ranging from v1.5.7849 to v1.8.23117 I can use the ur_driver.
Beyond v3.x you need to use the ur_modern_driver.
I don't quite now which version I am running however and need to know if there is a command to figure out which ur version my arm is running?

A:

simply open the UI and the top left corner returns a small window about the system settings.
