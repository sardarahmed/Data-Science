Q:

sicktoolbox installation

Hi,
I have tried to install sicktoolbox on ROS, but I really do not know how to do it?!!!
First I have installed the sicktoolbox as described on the   "The Sick Lidar Matlab/C++ Toolbox - A Quick Start Guide". It works in all examples.
After that my intention was to install the toolbox on ROS.
A can´t make the rosmake step, because it nevers found the sicktoolbox package.
May I put the sicktoolbox in a proper directory?
Like (my_installation_dir)/ros/diamondback/stacks/sicktoolbox   !!!
Where is rosmake searching for the packages? OR how can I do it?
And the sicktoolbox_wrapper, is it created by rosmake?
All that can be stupid question, but I cann´t overcome this...
Can anyone give me all the steps.
Thanks for you help.
Daniel

When I tried to install Sick Lidar Matlab/C++ toolbox I got errors, lot of them. Probably something is missing.

A:

First, check that your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set up correctly.
If it is, you should be able to roscd to sicktoolbox.
