A:

I have no experience with the package you link to, but from a cursory glance at the code, I don't think it uses ros_control or exposes any of the infrastructure the controller_manager would use to list controllers.
Are you sure that this is supposed to work that way? Have you asked the authors?

I have no experience with UAVs, so I'm afraid I wouldn't be the best person to assist you.
