Hi, I got the same problem on Ubuntu 16.04.1. I tried to remove the bad file but useless.
Hope someone can solve this.

A:

It looks like you did not execute step 1.2 correctly. Did the command prompt you for additional input or give you some other sort of strange prompt after you tried to execute:  sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list' (Note that the entire command should be entered on a single line)
You should remove the bad file with: sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.listsudo and execute step 1.2 again.

it asks me to enter the password and then the terminal allows me to enter a new line immediately

It sounds like the bad file has been removed somehow. "execute the deb packages" is not a thing I understand. Please be more specific or list the exact command you're running.

If sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list' works correctly, it should not print anything and should return you to the shell prompt.

You should then continue with the rest of the install steps, starting with step 1.3
