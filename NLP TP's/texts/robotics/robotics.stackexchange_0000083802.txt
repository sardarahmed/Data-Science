Q:

how prevent rotation with teb_local_planner

Hi, I'm using navigation stack and using teb_local_planner for path planning.
I change this parameter  "max_vel_x_backwards: 0.0" so the robot will not move backwards.
But I also want the robot not to rotate on itself.
how can I do?

Hello,
I am facing the same problem. I have a robot that rotates with a 1.4m radius and that is not able to perform backwards movements (or lets say that I truly prefer it doesn't due to security reasons). Did you manage to find a solution?
Thank you

have you tried adjusting the turning radius parameter?

I have. And that part seems to be working. The problem is the backward movement. My robot cannot perform backward movement. I'd be comfortable with a message from the planner saying it is impossible to find a path...

@JohnMdz i tried what you said, it looks like I am also facing the same issue. I am also getting the same warning about control loop missing its desired refresh rate. I would like to know if @pietrocolombo has figured this out or not ...

@JohnMdz we have not solved the issue.
on the other hand we are developing another local planner

@JohnMdz did you ever find a way to handle the backwards movement issue?

unfortunately not

A:

As I can understand you want your robot to avoid in-place rotations and moving backwards.
Avoiding both backing up and in-place rotations can get your robot stuck if there is an obstacle in front of it. In this case the recovery-behavior will take place to get the robot unstuck (NOTE that the default recovery behavior rotates in place). That is set by the recovery_behaviors and clearing_rotation_allowed parameters from move_base. This means that in order to avoid in-place rotations when stuck you will need a custom recovery behavior plugin in this case. 
Please post your teb_local_planner parameters (.yaml) and move_base.launch files so we can see your current configuration.

I don't fully agree. I understand that the robot may be stuck if it unable to perform backwards or in place movements/rotations. My main issue is that the planner always consider the backwards movement and not only in obstacle avoidance situations.
