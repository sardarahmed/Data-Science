Q:

Fedora stageros rosmake - undefined reference

Hello, trying to install stage on a working ROS (fuerte) install (verified through all tutorials), but at some point when I try to rosmake:

/usr/bin/ld:
CMakeFiles/bin/stageros.dir/src/stageros.o:
undefined reference to symbol
'_ZN2Fl4waitEd'   /usr/bin/ld: note:
'_ZN2Fl4waitEd' is defined in DSO
/lib/libfltk.so.1.3 so try adding it
to the linker command line
/lib/libfltk.so.1.3: could not read
symbols: Invalid operation   collect2:
error: ld returned 1 exit status
make[4]: *** [../bin/stageros] Error 1

No problems with rosdep either.
I thought this was related to this ticket, but shouldn't this be fixed? https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4441
Thanks so much for any help!

I don't know the answer, but what version of ROS you're working with will be important to answering the question.

A:

On Fedora, that reference is supposed to be satisfied by installing fltk-devel.
What does this do?
$ rosdep install stage

UPDATE: try this, then check to see if the fltk package named is actually installed:
$ rosdep resolve fltk

UPDATE2: that #4441 fix was to an older version of stage (3.2.2). Fuerte has stage 4.1.1.
I can't tell whether or not that fix was ever applied upstream. It may have gotten lost in the version upgrade.
I recommend opening a new ticket for Fuerte, referring back to #4441 and to this question.

When I do "rosdep install stage" I get the message: "#All required rosdeps installed successfully" then when I retry rosmake I get the exact same error.

When I do "rosdep resolve fltk" I get the message: "#yum" followed by the message "fltk-devel" , when I retry rosmake I get the exact same error.

Does yum say fltk-devel is actually installed?
