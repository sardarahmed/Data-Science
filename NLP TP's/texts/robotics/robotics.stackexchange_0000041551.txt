Q:

Anyone have succeed to compile vslam package in electric?

Hi.
I'm trying to use vslam packge in electric, however, it shows an error about "pcl" and "opencv" all the time.
I even have installed all the dependencies that the vslam pkg needs.
Have anyone succeed to compile vslam pkg recently?

A:

That part of the vslam wikipage where it says it's "experimental, unsupported, research code", and that it doesn't work anymore?
That's all true.
