Q:

Ompl ros calling the joint space planner

Hi,
I am trying to call the joint space planner based on this tutorial :http://www.ros.org/wiki/ompl_ros_interface/Tutorials/Calling%20the%20joint%20space%20planner. But I found error message.  I am testing on Ros Fuerte Ubuntu Precise 12.04. Thank you in  advance.

I can execute that example without error. Copy the error message to help you better. Because as you put, just say you have a mistake, nothing more

Thanks for the respond. the error is saying :[ERROR] [1368147736.105421840]: Motion planning failed, and the pr2 simulation on rviz does'nt move. when I try execute another example : rosrun rviz_display_trajectory_tutorial rviz_display_trajectory, the robot moves successfully. any idea?

I managed to execute it, but first I need to execute another code from pr2 package, move_arm_joint_goal and then execute the ompl_joint_goal. Thanks.
