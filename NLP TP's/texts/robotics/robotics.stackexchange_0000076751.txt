Q:

Getting started with Gazebo for ROS?

Hello fellow ROS users,
I just started on a project using the ROS navigation stack. I am using Ubuntu Trusty and ROS Indigo. I already have a ROS project that I have worked on and I am able to simulate the same using Rviz. Now, I would like to use Gazebo for the simulation?
Anybody with pointers on how to get started? Is there a way to directly connect my ROS project to Gazebo?
