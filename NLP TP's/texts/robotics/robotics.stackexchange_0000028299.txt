Q:

Prevent spawned robot model from moving

Hi,
I want to control the robot model that I spawned using spawn_model script, but after spawning it starts to rotate slightly, and I think this causes problems with Moveit package, because when I try to execute planned path I get this error:
[ERROR] [1507023800.853643333, 2796.811000000]: 
Invalid Trajectory: start point deviates from current robot state more than 0.01
joint 'Kuka_kr3__base_revolute': expected: -0.441804, current: -0.420193

How can I stop such movement?

It might be a problem with the controller you are using in the simulation. I had a similar problem with the controller of a robot gripper that caused the gripper to move without giving any commands. Which controller are you using? Can you post the code of the UpdateChild() function?

A:

The answer is to set damping and friction properties in URDF correctly
