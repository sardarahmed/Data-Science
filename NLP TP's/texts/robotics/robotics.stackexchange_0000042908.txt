Q:

How to use a gazebo plugin

Hi,
I have written a simple gazebo world plugin and compiled it (following the tutorial).
Now I am not sure how to use this plugin. I am using ROS fuerte on Ubuntu 12.0.4.
Is there a tutorial to explain it? Can I simply add a plugin tag into the .world file?
Thanks,

I thought this tutorial can be used for standalone gazebo not gazebo with ROS. Am I right?

yes this is for standalone gazebo....but the part of using a plugin can be used for both standalone and for  gazebo with ros.
