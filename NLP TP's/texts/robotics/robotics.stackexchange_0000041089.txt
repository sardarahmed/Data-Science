Q:

Who is allowed to fix bugs in ros_comm (and other WG) stacks?

I noticed that help of rossrv erroneously refers to rosmsg.
It should say:
rossrv is a command-line tool for displaying information about ROS Service types.
instead of:
rosmsg is a command-line tool for displaying information about ROS Message types.
Also all references in fullhelp to message should be changed to service:
  rossrv show Show message description
  rossrv list List all messages
  rossrv md5  Display message md5sum
  rossrv package    List messages in a package
  rossrv packages   List packages that contain messages

The simple fix is to make a change in this file: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/changeset/16304/stacks/ros_comm/trunk/tools/rosmsg/src/rosmsg/init.py
Instead of this:
def fullusage(cmd):
"""
:param cmd: command name, ``str``
:returns: usage text for cmd, ``str``
"""
return """rosmsg is a command-line tool for displaying information about ROS Message types.
Commands:
\t%(cmd)s show\tShow message description
\t%(cmd)s list\tList all messages
\t%(cmd)s md5\tDisplay message md5sum
\t%(cmd)s package\tList messages in a package
\t%(cmd)s packages\tList packages that contain messages

Do something like this:
def fullusage(cmd):
"""
:param cmd: command name, ``str``
:returns: usage text for cmd, ``str``
"""
if cmd == "rosmsg":
    type_string = "Message"
else:
    type_string = "Service"   

    return """%(cmd)s is a command-line tool for displaying information about ROS %(type_string)s types.

Commands:
\t%(cmd)s show\tShow %(type_string)s description
\t%(cmd)s list\tList all %(type_string)ss
\t%(cmd)s md5\tDisplay %(type_string)s md5sum
\t%(cmd)s package\tList %(type_string)ss in a package
\t%(cmd)s packages\tList packages that contain %(type_string)ss

My question is what is the way to proceed:
a) I need to create bug, submit apatch, get it reviewed, etc. or
b) Ask A Willow Garage employee to commit this fix, or
c) I should leave things as is as not important.

A:

a) If you create a bug ticket and attach the patch, someone will almost certainly fix it fairly quickly.

The question remains does it have to be "someone to fix it" or can it be me?

By "fix it" I just meant apply your patch. If you want commit access to the repository, go to https://code.ros.org/gf/project/ros/ and click on "Request to join project".
