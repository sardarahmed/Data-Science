Q:

Are time-of-flight cameras like the swissranger affected by outdoor fog?

I'm looking to build an outdoor robot and I need to know if time-of-flight cameras like the SwissRangerâ„¢ SR4500 work in fog, does anybody have some experiences on that?

A:

The swissranger is a RF-modulated light sources with phase detectors which is one type of time of flight camera. The other type is Range Gated Imager. The Wiki Page for time-of-flight cameras http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_camera  states this for the Range Gated imagers: 
"Range gated imagers can also be used in 2D imaging to suppress anything outside a specified distance range, such as to see through fog. A pulsed laser provides illumination, and an optical gate allows light to reach the imager only during the desired time period."
It also states that:
"The ZCam by 3DV Systems is a range-gated system."
