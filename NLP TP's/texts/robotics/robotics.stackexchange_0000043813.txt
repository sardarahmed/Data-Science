Q:

ROS Communication Protocol

Hello,
Is there a complete documentation for the ROS communication protocol anywhere?
(especially explaining the buildup of the XMLrpc messages)
I want to write a very slim ROS independent node in C for it, which does not use any ROS library.
Do I need XML for the Master or is there another simpler possibility of publishing or subscribing topics?
Regards,
Cyborg-X1

A:

I guess the conceptual overview wiki page is a good starting point. The master xmlrpc API and slave xmlrpc API and parameter xmlrpc API pages should provide a hopefully complete list of xmlrpc functions that are implemented by the core and that must be implemented (slave api) by a node.
For setting up subscriptions and publications and accessing parameters, xmlrpc will be required. The actual communication on the topics then uses a different binary format. Have a look at the msg wiki page for at least some information. For a really generic implementation of ros in C, you will have to implement a message generator that translates msg files to c files that contain code for serializing and deserializing that message. The serialized message format is actually pretty simple. Best if you have a look at the generated files for C++ or Python to find out more information.

Is there a documentation for the direct XML format like below (captured by wireshark):

Well, that's just normal xmlrpc. Google shows this as first hit.

Oh, ok, thought that is done by ros, because somewhere in the text it says it was "heavily" changed.
