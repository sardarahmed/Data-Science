Q:

Problem with turtlebot bringup minimal on Fuerte

I'm following the Turtlebot tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/groovy/TurtleBot%20Bringup. I am attempting to run the command:
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

However, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Param xml is <param command="$(arg urdf_file)" name="robot_description"/>

Note that I am simply using a Create base and not an actual Turtlebot. The thing is that I was able to run the above command without problem before I upgrated Ubuntu (12.04) with:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

I tried the following (http://answers.ros.org/question/57161/turtlebot_bringup-error-invalid-param-tag/) to fix my problem, but it didn't work. Any suggestions? Thanks!

Alright, so I fixed my problem by reinstalling all Turtlebot packages. I didn't think it would be as simple as that. I won't update my packages anymore!
