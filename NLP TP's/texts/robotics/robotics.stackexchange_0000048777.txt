Q:

Is cmvision a working package?

Hello all, I've noticed that cmvision is a package listed on the ROS wiki, but there seems to be no "current" instructions on how to install the code.
I did come across an older clone of the wiki which lists the package, but that code didn't build:

  In file included from /.../ros-stacks/cmvision/src/color_gui.cpp:34:0:
  /.../ros-stacks/cmvision/src/cmvision_color_blob_finder.h:31:32: fatal error: cv_bridge/CvBridge.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.
  In file included from /.../ros-stacks/cmvision/src/main.cpp:24:0:
  /home/ubuntu/ros-stacks/cmvision/src/cmvision_color_blob_finder.h:31:32: fatal error: cv_bridge/CvBridge.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.
  In file included from /.../ros-stacks/cmvision/src/color_gui.cpp:34:0:
  /.../ros-stacks/cmvision/src/color_gui.h:34:32: fatal error: cv_bridge/CvBridge.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.

It looks like opencv has changed a smidge since this package was written so it would need to be updated... Is there an updated repo somewhere else? Has the package been made obsolete by something else? Any pointers?
(And yes I did see the homebrew post, but the instructions aren't current either.

I think cmvision has been unmaintained for quite some time. I got it working with fuerte a while back, but I don't remember what that required.

I can confirm I am getting the same error when writing an image subscriber like in this tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_transport/Tutorials/SubscribingToImages

A:

Yes, I've been working with it to track blobs.

I'm tracking blobs, now I need to write a node to generate camera tracking, and then on to sending twist messages to the platform.
$ cd <some ros workspace directory>
$ svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/vision/cmvision
$ rospack profile
$ roscd cmvision
$ rosmake --rosdep-install

Hi Alan, the sources that you suggested were the ones that resulted in the posted error message. What version of ROS were/are you successfully using this package with?

@trinighost I am working in groovy, it seems like CvBridge.h is deprecated in this version and I was able to get rid of the error by using cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h. Of course, now I have other errors, but perhaps you will have more luck!
