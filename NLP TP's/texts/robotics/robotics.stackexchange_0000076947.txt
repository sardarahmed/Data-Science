Q:

ROS-Indigo installation on Raspberry-Pi failes on "rosmake" package

Hello ROS community,
I'm installing ROS on a Raspberry-Pi 2, I've followed this guide closely to install ROS on Jessie.
On Section 3.3 - "Building the catkin workspace":
Running the first command - "Invoke catkin_make_isolated":

sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/indigo

The building process begins installing the packages (48 of them), but on package 21 - which is the 'rosmake' package, it fails, providing the following error message:

==> Processing catkin package: 'rosmake'
==> Building with env: '/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh'
Makefile exists, skipping explicit cmake invocation...
==> make cmake_check_build_system in '/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/rosmake'
make: *** No rule to make target 'cmake_check_build_system'.  Stop.
<== Failed to process package 'rosmake':
Command '['/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh', 'make', 'cmake_check_build_system']' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/rosmake && /opt/ros/indigo/env.sh make cmake_check_build_system

Command failed, exiting.
I've tried building with the -j2 option, just in case, although most likely it's not related to my problem.
What can I do about it ? There don't seem to be any records of this problem on any forums etc., from what I've seen through a quick search..
Thanks in advance for any suggestions and feedback.

Did you ever find the solution because I am currently struggling with Rospack aswell
Comment by bogo on 2017-08-30:
@Toasted_Tiger Unfortunately no. Eventually I didn't use ROS at all for what I was doing, so had no need to fix the problem.. However, William's suggestion seems worth trying, although IIRC it fixed my specific issue but the installation got stuck on a later stage... Good luck !

A:

It looks like your generated Makefile is messed up. Use --force-cmake or remove the build folder for the package that's not building (in this case build_isolated/rosmake) and try again.
