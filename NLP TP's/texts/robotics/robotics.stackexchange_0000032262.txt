Q:

Service Call in ROSJava?

hi everybody!
I'm trying to call a Service in ROSJava. The Service itself is running on ROS/Cpp.
What i'm looking for, is the command "rosservice call /EnableFreeSpaceOrientation true" in Java.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava
The "Calling a Service" part seems to be the solution?
Have i missed something? Maybe i'm to stupid to see it or find it! :D
Hope for help! Thanks!

A:

Are you using the new, pure-Java rosjava or the old JNI-based rosjava?
FYI: we've just moved the JNI docs here:

As for the new rosjava, it's still in an alpha state and service calls are not easy-to-use right now.
