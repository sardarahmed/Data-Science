Q:

opening data file or image in specific folder in package

Is there a way to access a specific folder to open a data file or image in an ROS package? I suppose I could find the environmental variable HOME then write the full path by adding the strings, but it seems like there would be a more simple way.

A:

The more portable way to do this is to use getPath. This gets the addresyo of the specified package, then you can drill down to the specific directory. Note that this requires that the package is findable on the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.

Note that apparently the roslib Python library is deprecated (from roslib.packages is deprecated, what's its successor?).

rospkg was the 2nd generation, and catkin_pkg is the catkin aware library
