Q:

nao.rviz config file not found in the repo

Hello,
I'm following the tutorial on http://wiki.ros.org/nao/Tutorials/Getting-Started and in the Step 1.1. where I'm supposed to select a nao.rviz
src/nao_robot/nao_description/config/nao.rviz

I cannot find in the specified directory and as a result not able to load nao onto rviz.
You quick response would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

A:

This tutorial seems outdated as it starts with "Note: WARNING: This tutorial may be outdated and specific to the Nao ROS packages v0.1.". Maybe there is another tutorial that is more recent/up-to-date?
Looking at the nao_robot repository, there are 2 RViz config files:

urdf.rviz file in src/nao_robot/nao_description/config/urdf.rviz that displays the robot model and it's transforms
nao_full.rviz at nao_bringup/config/nao_full.rviz. It seems to display the sensor data as well and not only the model of the robot.

As the screenshot in the tutorial shows camera images and sonar data, I think you want to use the second one.
Hope this helps,

Thanks for your reply. I already tried the config file you specified. As soon as I select this config file rviz crashes with this error:
[ERROR] [1520245896.720572456]: Error getting latest time from frame 'base_footprint' to frame 'base_footprint':  (Error code: 1)

Thanks and sorry about that, I'm rather new to this forum.

This still doesn't give use the commands you ran before starting RViz. Did you run any launchfile from nao_bringup before starting RViz (cf 1.0 of tutorial) ?
robot description is set in nao_description/upload_nao.launch, that is launched automatically when you start nao_bringup/nao_full_py.launch
