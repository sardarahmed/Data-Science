Q:

Possible to communicate with new master without process restart?

Often when debugging, a launch which was responsible for the original Master goes down. When this happens things that were connected that stay up are unable to communicate with the new Master when it comes up.

Is there a way around this?
Is it perhaps possible to reinitialize the node so that it connects to a new Master?

A:

In rospython it seems it's possible (if dangerous?) to do the following:
rospy.client._init_node_args = None
rospy.init_node( "node_name" )

I'm not sure if it's wise but it seems to work.

That is not a valid workaround.
