What does We enter environment variables. We can get the vars, if we run "env > /tmp/out", then source the ROS 2 local_setup.bash, then "env > /tmp/out1" and "diff /tmp/out /tmp/out1".  means ? where to run env>/tmp/out

Now while building the project i get an error : OSError: Cannot call rmtree on a symbolic link. Could it be because it set the path variables not correctly ?

A:

You run these commands like "env>/tmp/out" on a bash console. If you only run "env" on bash console you will see the environment of this bash console, If you then source the local_setup.bash on the same bash console and then run "env" on this bash console again, you will see that new environment vars are added and others are manipulated. You need to add these environment vars to eclipse.
"cannot resolve ros2 related commands" does mean , cannot resolve functions and methods and so on. You need to check https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Eclipse-Oxygen-with-ROS-2-and-rviz2#Debugging_with_eclipse   "eclipse indexer" section
