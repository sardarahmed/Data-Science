Q:

Openni registration problem

Hi,
I'm having a problem with the openni registration on a kinect.
As many people around here when i enable the depth_registration option i only receive NaN's.
This is on a fresh install of booth ubuntu 12.04 and ros groovy from yesterday.
I allready tried to follow this "tutorial" here and here because it's the same problem, but i still can't get the thing to work, and running the OpenNi samples every thing is great.
This is a problem that exists for a long time and no solution yet...
It's very annoying because i need it for my thesis
What can i try to solve this?
Thanks

I am having the same problem on my laptop: HP Mini 210 w/ Intel Atom, Ubuntu Precise-Fuerte.  Depth registration set to true in openni.launch causes all NAN values.  I am betting this is system dependent because my other laptop with an AMD processor and graphics card works well with openni depth registration (same software).

I also think it is hardware dependent. working on my room there is another studend  with a different pc and everything works fine (just by instaling openni-camera and launch).
For me the strange thing is that the OpenNi binaries works flawless on every pc, but the ROS (and PCL?) library doesn't

If you have this problem please say it on the github page.
here is my issue ticket: https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_camera/issues/13
They didn't seem to find that important (it seams they didn't even read thing right), maybe if more users put the same issue...

Hi ! I am struggling with the same problem. Did you find a solution ?
Comment by jcc on 2013-05-23:
My "solution" was to switch to a 64bits ubuntu.
Comment by Lucile on 2013-05-23:
Ok. Thank you. My Turtlebot was delivered with a 32 bits computer, so I'll have to deal with it.

A:

This is a bug in Libopenni-dev. It does not work proper with 32 bit OS. You may work with an older version or install a 64 bit OS.
