Q:

Callback function to a Class member function

Hi all, this question might have just a trivial answer, but because i'm new to ROS and might be looking at the wrong places, I still can't figure it out. So, I want to create a service where the callback function would call a function of an Object (e.g. Board.executeCommand() ) . First, is it even possible? If it is, how do you do it? Thank you all..
EDIT: By the way, i'm using C++ as the language.

You should specify which language -- in Python it is as simple as using class_instance.method_name, in C++, you will have to use Boost::Bind.

Uh, i forgot to mention that. I'm using C++. I'll edit my question. Could help explaining a little bit how to use Boost::Bind ? cause i'm originally a Java programmer, and still learning C++ as well. Thanks..
