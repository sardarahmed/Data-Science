Q:

Slam and Vision (good resources)?

I would like to know if there is a good source that combines Slam problem with vision. From mathematical perspective, there are numerous resources that handle SLAM ,however, I didn't find a good source that focuses on slam and vision.  

A:

Someuseful resources
Video lecture : Monocular SLAM and Real-Time Scene Perception
Lecture slides from TU-Dresden Vision-based SLAM lecture 
Lecture from Bristol University (some links dead) : Visual SLAM tutorial
