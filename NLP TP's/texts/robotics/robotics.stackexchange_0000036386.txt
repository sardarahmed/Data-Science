Q:

Starting p3dx using p2os

Hi,
I am following the tutorials in http://www.ros.org/wiki/p2os/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20p2os
I have only one laptop mounted on the robot (p3dx) hence i am not following the 7th and 8th section of the above mentioned tutorial.
When i run the
rosrun p2os_dashboard p2os_dashboard

i see the dashboard getting displayed but except the Rosout (in green) ui others are not colored (red/green) and the battery is 0% even though the robot is fully charged. I am not able to enable or disable the motors.
I see the problem is here itself.
And when i run the
rosrun p2os_drivers p2os

i get the following errors.
[ INFO] [1323459143.327099680]: using serial port: [/dev/ttyS0]
[ INFO] [1323459143.360479690]: P2OS connection opening serial port /dev/ttyS0...
[ERROR] [1323459143.360617485]: P2OS::Setup():tcgetattr():
[ERROR] [1323459143.360707540]: p2os setup failed...

I have given the read and write permissions to ttyS* and ttyUSB*.
I am able to use ROSARIA and get the robot moving using keyboard operations.
I am sure something is being missed. Pls let me know
Thanks,
Karthik

Ok found the issue.
Had to remap the param name port to /dev/ttyUSB0
Its working now
Thanks,
Karthik

You may update the param at ./p2os_driver/include/p2os_driver/robot_params.h but beware that the sick laser usage might have a conflict at this port. You may have it as a param in the launch file.
