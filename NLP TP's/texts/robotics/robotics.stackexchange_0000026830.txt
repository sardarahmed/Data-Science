Q:

Skid Steer Drive Plugin unable to find joints when it is included in a sdf

Hi,
I am creating a new robot model, to do so I include the mobile platform and the sensors in the robot's sdf.
When I add this robot an SkidSteerDrivePlugin error[1] appears saying it is unable to find the joints.
If instead of the robot's sdf[2] I launch only the platform's sdf[3] then it works.
I tried unsuccessfuly to:

move the plugin tag up to the robot's model
change the joints to segway_rmp400::the_joint
both at same time
find the patched plugin mentioned in "question/3311/skidsteerdriveplugin"

In the "question/3311/skidsteerdriveplugin" something similar happens because the plugin has the joint names hard coded. I suppose the problem is there
Should I have to create a world with all the sdf inside without using includes?
Thanks in advance!
[1] The error
Error [SkidSteerDrivePlugin.cc:51] Unable to find the right_front joint in model teo.
Error [SkidSteerDrivePlugin.cc:51] Unable to find the right_rear joint in model teo.
Error [SkidSteerDrivePlugin.cc:51] Unable to find the left_front joint in model teo.
Error [SkidSteerDrivePlugin.cc:51] Unable to find the left_rear joint in model teo.

[2] The robot's SDF
 <model name="teo">
   <include>
     <uri>model://segway_rmp400</uri>
     <name>segway_rmp400</name>
     <pose>0 0 0 0 0 0</pose>
   </include>
   ...

[3] The platform's SDF
<model name="segway_rmp400">
  <link name="chassis">..</link>
  ...
  <plugin name="SkidSteerDrivePlugin" filename="libSkidSteerDrivePlugin.so">
    <right_front>right_front</right_front>
    <right_rear>right_rear</right_rear>
    <left_front>left_front</left_front>
    <left_rear>left_rear</left_rear>
    <max_force>100.0</max_force>
  </plugin>
</model>

A:

You can try plugin from gazebo_ros_pkgs documented here: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/ROS_Motor_and_Sensor_Plugins#Skid_Steering_Drive. Let me know in case of any problems with this plugin.
