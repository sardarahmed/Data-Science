Q:

Why rosdep install doesn't work?

Hello, I am trying to install the rosaria package trough rosdep but when I run the command rosdep install rosaria along this tutorial this is what I obtain :
robotics@robotics-MacBookAir:~/catkin_ws/src$ rosdep install rosaria
Executing script below with cwd=/tmp
{{{
#!/bin/bash
if test "x`dpkg-query -W -f='${Package} ${Status} ${Version}\n' libaria-sourcedep`" != 'xlibaria-sourcedep install ok installed 2.8.0-1'; then
 echo "libaria-sourcedep not installed"
  exit 1
else
  exit 0
fi

}}}

#All required rosdeps installed successfully
robotics@robotics-MacBookAir:~/catkin_ws/src$

And then if I try to run: rosrun rosaria RosAria, nothing happen and it crashes.
UPDATE:
This is what I obtain when I run :
roscd && cd ../src
cd ..
catkin_make

git clone https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria.git
robotics@robotics-MacBookAir:~/catkin_ws/src$ roscd && cd ../src
robotics@robotics-MacBookAir:~/catkin_ws/src$ git clone https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria.git
fatal: destination path 'rosaria' already exists and is not an empty directory.

Do you have an idea about what would be the cause of this problem?

A:

That's not actually installing ROSAria. You need to compile the source. Run the following.
$ roscd && cd ../src
$ git https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria.git
$ cd ../ && catkin_make

But, as a side note, you can use p2os to work with Pioneer robots by using apt-get.
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-p2os-*

Thank you for the reply, I've already try git clone https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosar... then catkin_make but when I do rosrun rosaria RosAria nothing at all happens. I wonder it was because of rosdep.
Comment by vince on 2015-07-08:
I also tried sudo apt-get install ros-jade-p2os-*, it seems working but I get errors. I need to fix that but I would prefer working with RosAria since I use to.
Comment by allenh1 on 2015-07-09:
Could you update your question with the output of the relevant commands? I also might suggest you run source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash and try ROSAria again. But if you're getting errors with p2os, please let me know, as I'm the p2os maintainer.
Comment by vince on 2015-07-09:
I have already source after catkin_make, in that case it does not find the package but here, it finds it but nothing about even that it cannot find the master.
For p2os I have already fix it, but I am wondering if I need p2os_dashboard package because it does not exist.
Comment by allenh1 on 2015-07-09:
You do not need p2os_dashboard. I'm actually planning to completely redo that program. But it is not anywhere close to a necessity. Unfortunately, I cannot help much with ROSAria.
