Q:

cannot install ros electric source (Checkout problem, after uninstalling)

Hi!
I had a mess because I installed the source and binary electric ros versions. I tried to take everything out and install the source version again, but it does not work. It says there is a problem with the version checkout. What can it be? (I removed everythin ros-el* in apt-get and the source folder ~/ros).
I tried to install the full version. This is what I get:

:~$ rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=electric&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no"
rosinstall operating on /home/dlr/ros from specifications in rosinstall files  http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=electric&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no

A:

I moved to ubuntu 11.10, and althought this has nothing to do with the problem, I installed ROS from source on a clean ubuntu installation. I am sorry not to post the anwer to your question, but I needed ROS working ASAP. I'll keep an eze on vcstools whenever I'm having this problem again.
