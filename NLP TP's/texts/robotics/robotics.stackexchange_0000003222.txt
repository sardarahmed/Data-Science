Q:

Predicting the impact point of a moving object

Suppose we have a moving object (a horizontal projectile motion as one of the most basic examples). Is there any way to predict where it will hit finally? Please note that I'm looking for a machine learning method not a closed form solution.
Although we can track the motion, using Kalman filter, That is only applicable when we want to predict the new future(As far as I'm considered). But I need to predict the ultimate goal of a moving object.
To better express the problem let see the following example:
Suppose a goalkeeper robot that of course uses filtering methods to smooth the ball motion. It needs to predict if the ball is going to enter the goal or not, before it decide to catch the ball or neglect it to go out.
Input data is a time series of location and velocity [x,y,z,v].

A:

Unless you are talking about something higher-order (like learning the behavior of an autonomous agent and predicting how it will move in the future), what you are looking for is to create a simple physics simulator.  
It will be closed-form, unless you are asking how to build a system that can "learn" the laws of physics.
