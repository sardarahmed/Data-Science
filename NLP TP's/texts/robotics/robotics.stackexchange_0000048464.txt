A:

I'd say you forget to run some node in your second try. But it's impossible to diagnose from a far what that might have been... I'd have a look at the output of the mapping node and check if there is data flowing on all the topics it subscribed to.
Driving around a bit also is a good idea, because the map usually only get's updated, if it changes and most mapping algorithms won't update the map without robot movement... depending on the launch order the first map can sometimes get missing, even though the topic is latched. Try to drive a few meters in one direction, if that happens.
