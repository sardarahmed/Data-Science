Q:

ROS (Jade) using anaconda python on OS X

I see from the install instructions that I should use the system Python, not the homebrew Python. I'm not interested in using homebrew Python. However, I'd very much like to use a conda python environment for ROS.
Is it advisable to then do echo "$(brew --prefix)/lib/python2.7/site-packages" >> ~/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth, analogous to what the install document suggest for the system python? The site-package of brew contain a bunch of modules that conflict with conda's modules (e.g. numpy).
It looks like homebrew is largely calling pip to install Python modules. If it calls the anaconda pip, then the modules should be installed under the anaconda environment's site-package folder, and not homebrew's, right? Is there any other mechanism that homebrew is using?

A:

I'm by no means an OSX expert, but I do know that ROS doesn't seem to like Anaconda very much (or the other way around). I've seen multiple Q&A's where all sorts of strange problems were in the end 'solved' by not using Anaconda anymore. You could run into those kind of issues here as well.
