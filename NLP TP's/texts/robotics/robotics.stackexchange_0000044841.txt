Q:

openni_camera operation mode 7

Dear community,
I am fooling around with the operation mode parameters for rgb and depth images on the openni_camera driver
When I set image_mode and depth_mode to 8 (160x120 @ 30FPS) everything works OK, but if I set mode 7 (160x120 @ 25FPS) the following warning pops out:
[ WARN] [1350026804.389463555]: Could not find any compatible image output mode for 160 x 120 @ 25. Falling back to default image output mode 640 x 480 @ 30.
[ WARN] [1350026804.389502213]: Could not find any compatible depth output mode for 160 x 120 @ 25. Falling back to default depth output mode 640 x 480 @ 30.

Is mode 7 (160x120 @ 25FPS) not really present on Kinect? Or is there any other reason for this behavior?
Thanks in advance for any hint.

A:

Mode 7 (160x120 @ 25FPS) is just not present on Kinect.
