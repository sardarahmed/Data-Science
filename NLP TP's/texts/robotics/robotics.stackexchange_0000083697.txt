Q:

two RGBD sensors in the same USB controller

Hi all;
I m experiencing problems when connecting two RGB-D sensors to the same PC, using the same USB controller (two Asus Xtion, 1 Xtion and one Orbbec astra, etc).
Both are attached to the same USB controller (see arrows):

tekniker@tekniker-mountain-2:~$ 

When I launch one (openni2_launch, astra_launch) the other that is already running automatically dies (I launch both of them specifying their camera ID):

Does anyone have a clue of what is happening?. It seems both of them are trying to access to the same nodelet... is there a way to solve this?
Thank you in advance,
Best,
Alberto

A:

The reason for the shutdown:

Reason given for shutdown: [new node
registered with same name]

You could create a new launch file that includes the two launch files, but puts them in different namespaces (check ns-argument in the include statement.
