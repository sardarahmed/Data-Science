Q:

How to solve 'pcl/features/board.h' not found?

I follow pcl recognition.
My src.
When I rosmake (full msg),it shows:
  [100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/correspondence_grouping.dir/src/correspondence_grouping.o
    /home/sam/code/ros/pcl/pcl_3d_recognition/src/correspondence_grouping.cpp:6:32: 嚴重錯誤： pcl/features/board.h：沒有此一檔案或目錄
    編譯插斷。
    make[3]: *** [CMakeFiles/correspondence_grouping.dir/src/correspondence_grouping.o] Error 1
    make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/sam/code/ros/pcl/pcl_3d_recognition/build'
    make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/correspondence_grouping.dir/all] Error 2

    make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/sam/code/ros/pcl/pcl_3d_recognition/build'

                

Sorry for my chinese output.
I failed to change to english version output by locale.
I try to run:
  export LANG=en_US
  export LC_MESSAGE=en_US.UTF-8 

How to fix the pcl header not found?
Thank you~
=============================================
I try to download perception_pcl_fuerte_unstable.
And I passed the rosmake.
If my manifest change to :
  <package>
    <description brief="pcl_3d_recognition">
  
       pcl_3d_recognition
  
    </description>
    <author>ROSfuerte</author>
    <license>BSD</license>
    <review status="unreviewed" notes=""/>
    <url>http://ros.org/wiki/pcl_3d_recognition</url>
    <depend package="roscpp"/>
    <depend package="pcl16"/>
    <depend package="pcl16_ros"/>
  
  </package>       

It will show the different error,but seems become very strange. Because even the basic header of first line(pcl/io/pcd_io.h) that also couldn't find.
The rosmake msg is (full msg):
    [100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/correspondence_grouping.dir/src/correspondence_grouping.o
    /home/sam/code/ros/pcl/pcl_3d_recognition/src/correspondence_grouping.cpp:1:27: 嚴重錯誤： pcl/io/pcd_io.h：沒有此一檔案或目錄

If I change manifest to
  <package>
    <description brief="pcl_3d_recognition">
  
       pcl_3d_recognition
  
    </description>
    <author>ROSfuerte</author>

    <depend package="pcl"/>
    <depend package="pcl_ros"/>
    <depend package="pcl16"/>
    <depend package="pcl16_ros"/>
  
  </package> 

It just show the first sitation of my problem I post in the beginning.
How to fix it?
Thank you~
==========================================
I only change the header to
  #include <pcl16/io/pcd_io.h>
  #include <pcl16/point_cloud.h>
  #include <pcl16/correspondence.h>
  #include <pcl16/features/normal_3d_omp.h>
  #include <pcl16/features/shot_omp.h>
  #include <pcl16/features/board.h>
  #include <pcl16/keypoints/uniform_sampling.h>
  #include <pcl16/recognition/cg/hough_3d.h>
  #include <pcl16/recognition/cg/geometric_consistency.h>
  #include <pcl16/visualization/pcl_visualizer.h>
  #include <pcl16/kdtree/kdtree_flann.h>
  #include <pcl16/kdtree/impl/kdtree_flann.hpp>
  #include <pcl16/common/transforms.h>
  #include <pcl16/console/parse.h>

But when I rosmake, it shows (full msg):

How to solve it?
Should I post this on another thread?
And does it means that the original problem (pcl/features/board.h) is solved?
Thank you~

According to this: http://www.pcl-users.org/3d-Object-Recognition-td3974058.html you need experimental version of pcl. So see also http://answers.ros.org/question/36837/how-to-use-current-experimental-pcl-together-with-ros-fuerte/
Comment by sam on 2012-09-20:
I have rosmake it success. But when I add dependency pcl16 and pcl16_ros, it still say the same problem. What to do next? Thank you~
Comment by Boris on 2012-09-20:
Please either remove all non-erroneous output from your question or use such services as pastebin for providing full log and source files. The text of you question is a way too long now, which makes it very difficult to read.
Comment by Boris on 2012-09-23:
Yes, I believe it is another problem. Most probably you need to install development version of VTK, if under Ubuntu try something like sudo apt-get vtk-dev. However it is not ROS-related question, so you have to ask it on PCL forums.

A:

According to this post you need experimental version of pcl. So see also http://answers.ros.org/question/36837/how-to-use-current-experimental-pcl-together-with-ros-fuerte/

EDIT #1 (THIS ONE IS NOT NECESSARY)
I think you have to use this repository. Once you check the code out replace SVN_URL variable in perception_pcl_unstable/pcl16/Makefile like:
SVN_URL = http://svn.pointclouds.org/pcl/trunk
This will checkout experimental pcl version (see relevant section here) during rosmake and the mentioned Makefile will put it in pcl16 namespace.
Hope it helps.

EDIT#2 (modified)
Everything of experimental pcl not only in a different namespace, but also all the headers in different root folder, i.e. pcl17. That is to make both versions of pcl (standard and experimental) available to user.
Thus, you should change all includes in you example code from
#include <pcl/io/pcd_io.h>

to
#include <pcl17/io/pcd_io.h>

as stated in section Integration with ROS.
Sorry for confusion, I should have given you this one at the beginning.

EDIT #3
Checkout code from same repository and do everything you did before, but for pcl17 instead of pcl16. pcl17 already has a correct SVN_URL in the Makefile to checkout experimental code.

Is that equal to perception_pcl_fuerte_unstable?
Comment by Boris on 2012-09-20:
I'm not sure, but if pcl16/Makefile is similar to this one, then probably yes.
Comment by sam on 2012-09-20:
I have edit my original post. What can I do next? Thank you~

It is not necessary to post comments here as all interested users will receive notification and will answer if they can.

I found I linked but it seems eigen lib is missing at compilaton.
