Q:

SLAM - detect initial position

Hello there,
I just performed SLAM with navigation_stack and V-REP simulator. As I know for know, we should give initial position of the robot so that AMCL performs localization and costmaps are generated properly.
My question is: Is there a way to skip the procedure of the user giving the initial position?

You can set the initial pose estimate in your AMCL launch file. It's still the "user" that provides it, but at least you don't have to do it in RViz. What I usually do is set the initial pose to [0 0 0] and then start the robot roughly at the origin of the SLAM-generated map. It quickly converges.

Hi,
you could try the global_localization service of amcl, this spreads the particles all over the map. Then you have to drive around and maybe you get the correct position after the particles converged.

Hi.. I used global_localization but I think it needs a lot driving over the map to work. It would be nicer if it needed only a 360 degrees relative to its own frame (for example)..

In addition, in my simulation this initial localization is happening by driving into the 'room' without calling /global_localization service...  It seems like this service is needless or there is something I am doing wrong..

I suggest you visualize the filter particles in rviz and compare their distribution when you initialize the node against using the /global_localization service.
