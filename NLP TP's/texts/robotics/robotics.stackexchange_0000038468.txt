Q:

Merge two OccupancyGridMaps

Hi there,
as the topic says: I want to merge/combine two OccupancyGridMaps.
The conditions:
I recieve two messages (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid) by two services. These two maps have the same resolution, but different postions and size (orientation can be omitted).
My question:
Is there an easy way to combine/overlay these maps and build a new map out of these? Or do I have to do this the hard way?
Kind regards, tiko

A:

The occupancy_grid_utils package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/occupancy_grid_utils) provides a "union of grids" operation.
