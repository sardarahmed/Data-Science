Q:

Installing packages and other client libraries

Hi,
Sorry for the repeated query, but someone pointed out that my question was very vague. My question is basically how do I go about installing all the wonderful software and packages available on ros.org into ROS on my system. I am using the latest version of ROS Diamondback on Mac OS X 10.5. Furthermore, I would like to know how to install the various client libraries that are available for ROS (is it a different procedure to install them, if so how?)
Thanks,
S.

I would like to install and use
roslua.
I've read through some of the
documentation (not all, so I might've
not come across it yet), but I am not
sure how to install roslua in my ros
system. That actually goes for any
client library or package that I like
to install.to install.

Thanks,
S.to install.

how about https://github.com/timn/roslua/blob/master/README ?

A:

On Ubuntu, some packages are installable via Ubuntu packages (i.e., apt-get, synaptic), so you could try that first.  If no Ubuntu package is available, you can download the source from the repository, put it in a subdirectory of your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and compile with with rosmake.  That's generally all you need to do.

Yes all packages work this way, including client libraries.

I suppose so, but I'm guessing at least roscpp and rospy will be installed by default if you install in any typical way.

Does this go for client libraries as well?
