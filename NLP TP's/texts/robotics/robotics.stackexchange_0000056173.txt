Q:

Re-scaling dimensions of STL files

Hello
I need to put a motor for my robot. I got the mesh from besttechnology.co.jp/modules/knowledge/?BTX050%20Dynamixel%20EX-106%2B ,
but it is on STP format. I opened it with 3D tool and i realiced that his long measure was 65m, when it should be 65mm. Then i scaled it into mm (on 3dtool-> moretools -> rescaling), and convert it into a stl file. I can open this new 3d file with all viewers (3dtool, freecad, meshlab...) but when i load it on my URDF file, the Rviz dont show the figure, and no error appears.. The color material is ok, couse i use it on another link. Some idea?
THX
