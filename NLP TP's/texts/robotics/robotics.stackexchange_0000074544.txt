Q:

Turtlebot never moves during "Sending goal" with frontier_exploration

Different issue from http://answers.ros.org/question/196189/frontier_exploration-with-turtlebot/
Using a package I just made, which launches Gazebo, gmapping, and nodes from frontier_exploration by the following command:
roslaunch turtlebot_samples exploration_all.launch

Turtlebot stands still while I believe I give a goal point successfully (BTW I've added a step-by-step instruction for running a demo).

I'm guessing something in my config for frontier_exploration maybe specific to Turtlebot, but not sure. I'm looking at frontier_exploration/launch/global_map.launch and husky_navigation/launch/exploration.launch in particular.
Thanks.

A:

move_base was not running. I fixed it in this PR.
