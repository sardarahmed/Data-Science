Q:

CMake: PCL and Ros Hydro

I'm trying to follow this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Tutorials
However, I'm not sure what the CMake file needs to look like. I'm getting the following error when compiling:
Could not find a configuration file for package pcl.
Set pcl_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for pcl.
The file will have one of the following names:
pclConfig.cmake
pcl-config.cmake

A:

It looks like this tutorial is outdated. In hydro, pcl is no more available as a package dependency, but now as a system dependency, meaning the default CMake mechanism described here at the end of the section has to be used.
The moveit_ros_perception package can serve as an example (pretty sure you could find others, but that one was the first that crossed my mind).
