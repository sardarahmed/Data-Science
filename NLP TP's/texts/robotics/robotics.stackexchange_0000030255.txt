Q:

Publishing a xform from /map to /base_link?

Hey all -
Trying to get up to speed on the NavStack. Presently, when I run the launch file, I get the following error:

Waiting on transform from base_link to /map to become available before running costmap, tf error: Frame id /map does not exist!

Presently, my tf tree looks like this odom->base_link->base_laser. It makes sense that the tree should look like this: /map->odom->base_link->base_laser, however, I'm not sure A) who's responsibility it is to broadcast that transform and B) how to compute said transform. Any and all assistance would be greatly appreciated.

A:

If I am not wrong, that would be the responsibility of your positioning system to do that. (amcl, gmapping...).
It all depends what positioning solution you decide to use.
Have a look at the navigation tutorials, and in particular the robotsetup one. It is all explained there.

Raph - Thanks very much. I had read the tutorial, and it was helpful but the gmapping documentation was more illuminating: http://www.ros.org/wiki/gmapping#Provided_tf_Transforms
