Q:

Invoking "cmake" failed

i have created a workspace and inside the src, i cloned the following
https://github.com/viirya/ros-driver-techman-robot.git
and sourced the workspace and tried making catkin_make. and i am getting the following error

A:

there are missing dependencies. usb_cam is released for melodic so install it using apt. there is nothing released starting with tm_, so you need the tm_hardware_interface package from source (wherever you can get that from).
Note that the repo you clone is quite stale (~2years old). You could ask for help there. Especially as tm_hardware_interface is declared as a system dependency. This is probably a mistake or you'll get some proprietary library with your techman robot.
Anyways, I suggest to use the official Techman Repos, as long as there is no very specific need to use the other. This is also officially supported on Melodic and up-to-date...
