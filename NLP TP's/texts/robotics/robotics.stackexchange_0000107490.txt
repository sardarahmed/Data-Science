Q:

ROS Debug Clion - Controller

I have following problem. I am using clion and ROS (1). I use franka_ros to develop a controller.
Hear I want to mention, that I followed all the steps provided by clion - documentation website, to set up ROS in clion. Everything works fine. I can debug simple executables. I could also attach to a simple running executable node.
Now, I want to debug my written controller, based on franka_ros. I use a launch file and the "controller_manager"-package to launch the complete world. Everything works fine.
But my problem is, that I cannot attach to the process and debug the controller. First thing I notice, that the executable of the controller spawner process is "python3" and available debuggers are "Python/Native". When I attach to the process with the debuggers I cannot stop at breakpoints or get any information of my controller at all. I think it might be a problem of having the "controller_manager"-package in between.
Does anybody has some ideas or experiences with that ? Any hint or recommendation would be nice!
Thanks!

A:

As a general resource you'll likely want to look at the documentation for IDE integration on the ROS wiki at: https://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#CLion
What I think that you're running into however is that controllers are often run as injected components in a separate main loop and are loaded and unloaded dynamically. This means that if you want to debug them at runtime you need to attach your debugger to the main that the controller is going to run inside, and not the small launcher script which I speculate is what you're seeing as a python script, that's only sending a request to the controller manager.
Without more details in the question I think that's about as complete an answer as can be provided.
