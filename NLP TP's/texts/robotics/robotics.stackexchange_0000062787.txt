Q:

I keep getting:[rospack] Error: stack/package tum_ardrone not found

Hello,
I am quite new to ROS and ubuntu but whatever i try i am keep getting the error so i hope someone can help me out!
I need to install 2 packages:

ardrone_autonomy
tum_ardrone

i followed these steps for both packages:
# cd into ros root dir
roscd
# clone repository
git clone git://github.com/tum-vision/tum_ardrone.git tum_ardrone
# add to ros path (if required)
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:pwd/tum_ardrone
# build package (may take up to 10 minutes)
rosmake tum_ardrone
even though they are both in opt/ros/hydro i can only run ardrone_autonomy
whenever i try to run tum_ardrone i am getting the error.
leroy@leroy-pc:~$ env |grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=hydro
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros
In my .bashrc file the source is: source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
i am using ROS hydro and ubuntu 12.04.
thank you in advance!

A:

You need to extend your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH when you want to use it.
You mentioned that you added the tum_ardrone folder to it (add to ros path).
But later your environment does not contain that anymore.
You have to prepend / append that folder everytime you want to use rosbuild packages from that location.
