Q:

Could someone please provide a ROS-ready raspberry pi filesystem?

I've spent countless days trying to get ROS installed in my raspberry pi (running raspbian) so I could use it as an embedded system, and after so many dependency problems and manual system links, I sort of gave up.
There is a VM with ROS-indigo readily available for download, so couldn't someone provide a copy-paste filesystem for raspberry pi with ROS installed?

Which ROS distro are you looking to use? I have hydro running on my pi, and I suppose I could create an image from it.

That sounds great!
Would you please?

I'll post an answer here with a link once I create the image, but that might not be until next week.

Dan did you get a chance to create that image? or if you have the instruction on how to build ROS on a raspberry PI would really appreciate it thanks

I don't think I'm going to have a chance to get an image put together anytime soon, but I can definitely get you a rosinstall file along with some instructions.

that would be great when do you think you can get me that?
thanks

A:

Here is a rosinstall file I created from the install on my pi. I was essentially able to follow the hydro instructions.
Note that rosdep will complain about not being able to install python-rospkg, python-catkin-pkg, sbcl, and python-rosdep. Other than sbcl, which the instructions tell you how to deal with, the rest are installed with pip instead of apt.
You will also see
image_geometry: No definition of [opencv2] for OS [debian]
cv_bridge: No definition of [opencv2] for OS [debian]

Install opencv with apt-get install libopencv-dev
To silence the errors, add --skip-keys "python-rospkg python-catkin-pkg python-rosdep opencv2" to the rosdep call.
If you have any trouble, post a comment and I'll try to help.

Here is a script I used to install indigo on a few pis which is more or less the instructions stated above.
