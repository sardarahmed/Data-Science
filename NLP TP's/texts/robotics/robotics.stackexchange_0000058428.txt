Q:

Repeated rosmake failure

I'm trying to install ardrone_autonomy and tum_ardrone, both of which I have downloaded. However, whenever I use rosmake with these packages I get the error
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:11 (message):
  execute_process(/usr/bin/python
  "/opt/ros/hydro/ardrone_autonomy/build/catkin_generated/generate_cached_setup.py")
  returned error code 1
Call Stack (most recent call first):

  /opt/ros/hydro/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:249 (find_package)
  CMakeLists.txt:12 (rosbuild_init)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [all] Error 1

It's consistently the same error for both packages. Any ideas as to what is causing this?

A:

You should not use rosmake with catkin packages, but rather catkin_make. I advise to read up on catkin in the wiki if you have not used it before: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials
