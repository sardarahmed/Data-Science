Q:

3 way check valve

I am working on a micro dispensing system, using syringe pump. The design involves a syringe on top to be moved by stepper motor. There would be one liquid reservoir form which the syringe would pull liquid from, and push it to eject liquid from other end. 
When we pull the syringe, the liquid is sucked into the syringe, while the other opening is shut. When the syringe is pushed, the liquid is ejected from the other end.
The quantity of liquid to be dispensed would be very small (400mg) so i am using small syringe of 1 or 2 ml .. as per my measurement, after every 100 dispensing operations, 1 ml syringe would be empty and we would need to pull liquid from the reservoir into the syringe, and do the dispensing again. 
My question is, I am unsure about the check valve here. Is there a 'Single' check valve available which would allow this kind of flow to happen ?

Two comments:
One, you don't need a double/dual check valve; one on the inlet line and one on the outlet would work. See the image below. You haven't explained why two distinct check valves are less desirable than an all-in-one solution, so I'm suggesting it in the event it was overlooked. 
Two, I'm not sure how your measurements add up. You state, 

"The quantity of liquid to be dispensed would be very small (400mg)" 

and then later you state

after every 100 dispensing operations, 1 ml syringe would be empty.

Assuming the dispensing liquid is anywhere close to water, it will have a density of approximately 1g/cm3, or 1g/mL. So, a 400mg dispensing quantity means your 1mL syringe is empty after 2.5 doses. If you're going to get 100 doses of 400mg in a 1mL syringe, then that means that you've got 100*400 = 40,000mg, or 40g, in the 1mL syringe. That's 40g/mL, or about four times the density of lead.
