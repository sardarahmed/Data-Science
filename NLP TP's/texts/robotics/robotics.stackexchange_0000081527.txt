The package was successfully created.Then i went to catkin_ws and executed the command
catkin_make

CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "opencv2" with any
of the following names:
opencv2Config.cmake
opencv2-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "opencv2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"opencv2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"opencv2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
been installed.

A:

Well, it could not detect OpenCV2 package in ROS Kinetic version because kinetic has an OpenCV3 package in their Debain package as default.
First of all, you need to install (if you haven't install opencv before)
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-opencv3
Secondly, change the dependency to opencv3 from opencv2 in that concerned package and then catkin_make.
Hope it helps!
