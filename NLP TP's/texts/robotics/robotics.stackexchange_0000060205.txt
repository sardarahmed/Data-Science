Q:

tf_prefix for Fixed Frame in RViz

Hi,
I am using ROS Groovy and have just implemented using tf_prefix for the /tf joint states. However, while RViz correctly interprets the transform data, it does not apply the tf_prefix argument to the Fixed Frame. Is there any way to do this? I've had a search but nothing jumps out at me.
Kind Regards
Bart

A:

The fixed frame is just a parameter, you can set it with the full value of the frame_id including the prefix if you want.

That is exactly what I'm trying to avoid. I don't wish to hard code the transform prefix. However, at this time it's still possible to set the frame while RViz is running, so it's annoying but not fatal.
