Q:

cv_bridge and OpenCV 2.3.2

Hi!
im using ROS Electric installed from sources and OpenCV from svn and its has version 2.3.2
but if im trying to make cv_bridge
rosmake cv_bridge

it want to use 2.3.1:
Package opencv-2.3.1 was not found in the pkg-config search path.

How could i use OpenCV 2.3.2 instead of 2.3.1?
Thanks!

A:

One way that works for me consists in:

Copying the ROS OpenCV package somewhere. You may renamed this new package to something like opencv232.
Changing the Makefile so it downloads the last svn version.
Then rosmake -i (remove ROS_NOBUILD fisrt).

For cv_bridge:

Copy cv_bridge
Rename (opcional)
Change manifest dependency to opencv232
rosmake -i

Maybe not so clean, but it works.
