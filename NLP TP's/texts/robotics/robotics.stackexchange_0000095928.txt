Q:

Segfault in pluginlib-tutorial whenever adding Plugins-Description-File between  tags

Hi all,
Have anyone experienced a weird behavior below when working with pluginlib? Could you please help me understand the problem?
I trying to work with pluginlib by following the wiki-tutorial. By installing pluginlib-tutorials using sudo apt install ros-kinematic-pluginlib-tutorials, the main node works fine and normal.
But to build the same package from source, the error Segmentation fault (core dumped) keep appearing everytime adding <pluginlib_tutorials_ plugin="${prefix}/polygon_plugins.xml" /> in the package.xml file.
I can successfully initialize the pluginlib::ClassLoader object, but without "Plugin Description File" in the package.xml, I can not create plugin-instances.
My workspace setting:
test_ws/
└── src
    ├── pluginlib_tutorials_
    │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
    │   ├── include
    │   │   └── pluginlib_tutorials_
    │   │       ├── polygon_base.h
    │   │       └── polygon_plugins.h
    │   ├── package.xml
    │   ├── polygon_plugins.xml
    │   └── src
    │       ├── polygon_loader.cpp
    │       └── polygon_plugins.cpp

package.xml:
<buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
  <build_depend>pluginlib</build_depend>
  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
  <exec_depend>pluginlib</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>roscpp</exec_depend>
  <export>
    <pluginlib_tutorials_ plugin="${prefix}/polygon_plugins.xml" /> 
  </export>

Could anyone please help me?

A:

I finally understand the problem and fixed it successfully: The main reason is ros::package::xxx() compatible with boost-1.58 (installed by sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev) while I was using boost-1.70(from source) link. Return everything back to boost-1.58, everything's fine.
