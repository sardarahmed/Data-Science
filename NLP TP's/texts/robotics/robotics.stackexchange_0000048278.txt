Q:

ROS Groovy Turtlebot Install from Debs Path error

Hello!
I am following the instructions from here:
ros.org/wiki/turtlebot/Tutorials/groovy/Installation
Doing the debs installation to create my turtlebot computer.
I got all the way down to:
One last step if you have a kobuki base, you'll need to add kobuki's udev rules (you'll need your sudo password):

. /opt/turtlebot/groovy/setup.bash
rosrun kobuki_ftdi create_udev_rules

And encountered a small problem:
/opt/turtlebot/ does not exist.
Suggestions?

A:

I had the same problem. My directory is
. /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash rosrun kobuki_ftdi create_udev_rules
instead of
. /opt/turtlebot/groovy/setup.bash rosrun kobuki_ftdi create_udev_rules

Yes, there was a typo on the tutorial that's been fixed since. Thanks.
