Q:

topological navigation slam problem

Hi,
I am trying to run  topological navigation stack as mentioned in
http://ros.org/wiki/topological_navigation
on Ubuntu 10.04, ROS Diamondback (installed from repository using debs).
On launch, NO errors are reported but Stage GUI do not come up. No other GUI are present as well. The log files do not show termination of stage node or anyother node.
How shall i go forward?
I had tried the fresh installation on second machine as well. I recieve same behaviour from launch file.
Log file can be found at link.
Terminal output can be found at link.
