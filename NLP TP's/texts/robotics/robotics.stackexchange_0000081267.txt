Q:

ROS camera Sensor Gazebo

Hello, I have a camera (default gazebo model) in my world.
I launch gazebo using roslaunch.
On trying rostopic list, I do not see any topic published by the camera?
This is the output of rostopic list.
/clock
/gazebo/link_states
/gazebo/model_states
/gazebo/parameter_descriptions
/gazebo/parameter_updates
/gazebo/set_link_state
/gazebo/set_model_state
/rosout
/rosout_agg

How do i use the camera data from my simulation?

A:

I was making a mistake as I did not add a camera sensor plugin to my world file. Simply copy past the camera plugin lines from the ros plugin tutorials into your .world files, or your robot file, and launch gazebo by roslaunch [packagename] [launchfile].
After adding, rostopic list gives the published image topic. This can be visualized using rviz!
