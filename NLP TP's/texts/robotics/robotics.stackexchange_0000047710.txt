Q:

Kinect with turtlebot

I am running kinect with turtle bot. The value of pointcloud(/camera/rgb/points) and value of("/scan")remains constant. I am not unable to visualize both laser scan and poincloud in rviz. In rviz it shows transformation is correct, it shows the number of messages received which keeps on increasing but in poincloud side panel it says [0] points displayed from [0] messages. The hardware is fine because i have used with different machine and it works fine.
