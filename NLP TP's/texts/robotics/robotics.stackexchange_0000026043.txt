Q:

Multilple plugin loading

Hi
I've noticed that it is not possible to load more than one time a plugin
e.g., if I want to use the "rubble plugin" to generate rubble in two different areas, I can't load it two times, even if I change the "name" attribute
possible workaround are:

copy the library.so with a different name
write my own plugin and manage multiple zones

If it is not so complicated I think that multiple loading of plugins may be an interesting feature
what do you think?

Late summer at the earliest. Of course this is an open-source project so you are highly encouraged to tackle this problem yourself.
