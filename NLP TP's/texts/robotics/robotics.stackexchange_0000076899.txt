Q:

Unable to locate package ros-indigo-roscpp

I am on ubuntu 16.04, trying to install tum_simulator using the tutorial here: https://github.com/dougvk/tum_simulator
I first got stuck here:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

but used the solution found here: Can't resolve package dependencies when building ros for Ubuntu 16.04 by typing --os=ubuntu:trusty with the rosdep command.
however with this command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y --os=ubuntu:trusty

I get this error
E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-roscpp
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y ros-indigo-roscpp] failed

I can't find how to install the package roscpp manually or how to continue the installation.
Thanks for your help

The README.md in the repository you linked also explicitly state that those instructions are for Indigo:

tum_simulator on Indigo

To use them on Kinetic, you'll have to adapt them as you follow along.

You might run into some problems with Gazebo versions > 2.2 and the tum_* packages on Kinetic, even if you get the rosdep step to finish successfully.

A:

I am on ubuntu 16.04 [..]

and:

however with this command:

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y --os=ubuntu:trusty

I get this error

E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-roscpp

ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo -H apt-get install -y ros-indigo-roscpp] failed

Indigo is not supported / released on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04), which means that ros-indigo-roscpp doesn't exist there. Forcing rosdep to use the ubuntu:trusty defintions isn't going to change that.
You could try and see whether
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src

after having sourced the correct (Kinetic) setup.bash works.
PS: this is exactly why I never really use --rosdistro $DISTRO in command line examples: the instructions will get copy/pasted by someone in the future on a different OS/ROS release and no longer work. --rosdistro $DISTRO is only needed if you don't have a setup.bash sourced anyway.

Edit:

I'm not sure what you mean by sourcing the correct setup.bash..

That would be source /opt/ros/$DISTRO/setup.bash. That will set the relevant environment variables, making --rosdistro .. unnecessary.

I decided to try to follow the instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/tum_simulator#Installation
but to no avail, probably because I also have a different os version

Yes, those instructions are even older than the ones you found on dougvk/tum_simulator. Especially rosmake and friends are deprecated.

Is there a newer version of tum_simulator?

Not that I know of, but I'm really not into UAVs / quadrotors. You should probably spend some time searching for some, and / or try to contact a community. See Any quadrotor simulation package in ROS Kinetic? for a similar question.
But to get back to your original problem: can you show us the commands you've used and what their output was?

@frenchie007 AFAIK, the newest version is only Indigo.The indigo version itself is still not official ( not merged to the main repo).
I use the indigo version from dougvk github. It works fine! Just that the demo is not as complete as the official one,  But that's not a problem for me
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-10-25:
@alienmon: does it also work on ROS Kinetic? Because that is what the OP seems to be having problems with.
Comment by alienmon on 2016-10-25:
That one I'm not so sure, cause I only tried with indigo. I don't think it will work,  Buy maybe you can just try out @frenchie007
Comment by frenchie007 on 2016-10-25:
okay actually the simulator opens up but I can't control the drone.. I think it might be similar to here

I think I will just use a vm to have ubuntu precise and use the old instructions. thanks for you help

I would, if you can, use at least the Indigo version, which according to @alienmon, should work under Trusty.

I use Ubuntu 14.04 , and ROS indigo
