Q:

spawn world after gzserver start

Hello,
I would like to know if it's possible to spawn a world (sdf .world file) once gazebo is launched.
I tried to use the service /gazebo/spawn_sdf_model but I got this error: GazeboRosApiPlugin SpawnModel Failure: input xml format not recognized (I was loading the default willowgarage.world).
Did someone has already succed to spawn a world after gzserver startup?
thanks

A:

If you don't give Gazebo a world on startup, it will load empty.world. Unfortunately, "closing" a world and opening a new one is not supported yet. So the answer is no, but that doesn't mean someone can't have found a hacky way of doing it.
