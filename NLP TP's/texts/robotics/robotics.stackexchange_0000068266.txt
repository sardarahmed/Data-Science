Q:

Make nodes without making a package

Simple question. Can I create a node (in C++ or Python) without the need to make a whole package? It may be a really dumb question but was really curious.

A:

You can do it, but it is very impractical.
Take a look at this tutorial for a cpp example. Also, for python you can just create a .py file, import rospy, do your ROS stuff and run it. But watch out for dependency issues.
