Q:

what is inside your $PYTHONPATH?

Hello all,
I am trying to find a solution for the problem I have with this error message:
import rospkg
ImportError: No module named rospkg
Can somebody tell me what it should be inside the $PYTHONPATH exactly?
For me it is only : /opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
Thanks,

A:

You didn't provide any information about the platform you are using,how you installed ROS and which version you are using (see the support guidelines) so I assume you installed from Debian packages and you use Fuerte.
The debian package that contains rospkg is python-rospkg and the corresponding files are put into /usr/share/pyshared which is a system directory. That means that you don't need to add it to the python path since that's one of the default locations python searches for modules.
Did you install python-rospkg:
sudo apt-get install python-rospkg

Normally, the package should be installed automatically since it is a dependency of ROS. If it's not there, I'm sure something went wrong with your ROS installation.

I checked that one too. Finally I erased my Ubuntu 12.0.4 and re-installed Ubuntu 12.0.4 and ROS again. Everything works fine now. Knocking the wood!!
