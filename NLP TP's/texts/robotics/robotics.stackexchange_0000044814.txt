Q:

any example codes for rosbridge 2.0?

The good example codes at
http://code.google.com/p/brown-ros-pkg/wiki
are all based on rosbridge 1.0; and the example at
http://rosbridge.org/doku.php?id=rosbridge_protocol_v2.0
is relatively simple.
Am struggling to write client for rosbridge 2.0 based on the protocol itself...
So really appreciate if anybody can give links to example codes for 2.0, such as in C++/Javascript.

I would also love an example as a I have a complete Javascript application in rosbridge 1.0 and for the life of me I can't figure out from the existing docs how to translate it into rosbridge 2.0.

A:

I would recommend looking at Russell Toris' nav2Djs as an example:
https://github.com/RobotWebTools/nav2djs
Also, rosbridge_suite is temporarily moving to github under robotwebtools.  Please feel free to post issues and pull requests.

This link really helps. Under the RobotWebTools folder,  I also find quite a few other nice packages based on rosjs, all of which are written by Toris.
