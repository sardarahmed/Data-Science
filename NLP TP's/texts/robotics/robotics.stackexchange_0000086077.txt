Q:

NodeHandle class working

In the tutorials, I read that creating an object of NodeHandle registers my program as a node with ROS master.
Where I find the code that helps me understand this in depth?

A:

The sources for roscpp can be found in ros/ros_comm. NodeHandle itself: ros/ros_comm/clients/roscpp/src/libros/node_handle.cpp.
