Q:

navigation without a map?

Hi
I am trying to implement the navigation stack on a custom robot without a priori static map.
Can anyone give me a guideline to do this?
I have set the static_map field to false in the Global Costmap Configuration file.
If I understand the tutorial correctly, I have to include a map node in my launch file, but I don't have one...
I am new to ROS and would appreciate any help I can get :)

I have tried to create an empty *.pgm file and pointing the launchfile to it, but this results in my map-server-1 process dying...

Do you also have the corresponding *.yaml ? (that might be the reason for it dying)
But I want to know what is the use of having a separate map if it is empty ?

A:

A map is not necessary for running the navigation stack. All you need is a costmap, which can be created by costmap_2d. You can take a look at erratic_2dnav_local for an example configuration.
