Q:

Removing collisions from a link using parameter passing

I am trying to load some static models into a world. I would like them to not cause any collisions, so I am trying to remove them using the tutorial here: http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=param_passing_tutorial&cat=specification&
Has this been implemented in sdf 1.7 and the Gazebo release for ROS Noetic?
The models are showing up with the collision elements present.
I am running the latest release of ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04.5
My code is attached.C:\fakepath\test.world
Thanks!

A:

Parameter passing is only implemented in libsdformat 10 and later. I assume you're using Gazebo 11 (from the tag on the question), and that uses libsdformat9. However, I believe you can install libsdformat10 or later, run ign sdf -p on the input file and get an output that has the param-passing changes applied.

Correct. Where is the documentation connecting ROS, Gazebo, SDFormat version number and libsdformat version number? I couldn't find any definitive resource that would contain the kind of information you provided in this answer. Thanks!
