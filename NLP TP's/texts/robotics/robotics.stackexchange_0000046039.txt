Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: AttributeError

hi i am trying to use the split command so that i can split the voice input but getting an error
" AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split' "
code snippet is
def talkback(self, msg):

command = self.get_command(msg.data)

# Print the recognized words on the screen
rospy.loginfo("Command: " + msg.data)
#rospy.loginfo(msg.data)

#some_str = command
#some_wrd = 'time'

if 'time' in command.split():
    msg.data = strftime("%H:%M:%S ")
    self.soundhandle.say(msg.data, self.voice)
elif 'name' in command.split():
    self.soundhandle.say("my name is atom", self.voice) 
else:
        return

A:

The variable command is probably empty, i.e. set to None.
