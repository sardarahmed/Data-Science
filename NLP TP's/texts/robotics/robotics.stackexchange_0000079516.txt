Q:

which arm board is best for real time purpose

Hello, i want to connect some motors and sensors with one arm board and than connect it with pc. Here the pc will be doing all the heavy processing tasks while arm board will be just subscribing the joint trajectory values and than sending it to motors connected to its pins. In the same way it will be also reading the sensors and after calculating the encoder positions, it will be subscribing it to the main pc which will use that position for motion planning purpose.
