Q:

Export a CMake project into Catkin(ROS)

Hi,
i had a library compiled with cMake , and a .cpp executable that use this library. The building and running is made without the use of catkin or ros architecture.
I would like to import this project in a ros package in order to use it to take data and publish them through a node.

A:

Could you pose a specific question?
As for how to create package, try http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
You should be able to make additions to your existing CMakeLists.txt file to add support for building with ROS.
Consult http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt
If you want to provide the capability to build with and without ROS in the same CMakeLists.txt, try switching based on the definition of CATKIN_ENV, e.g.,
if (CATKIN_ENV)
  message (STATUS "Building for ROS")
  # ...
else (CATKIN_ENV)
  message (STATUS "Building without catkin")
  # ...
endif (CATKIN_ENV)
