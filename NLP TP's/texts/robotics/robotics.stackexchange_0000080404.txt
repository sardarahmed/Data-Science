Q:

How to run actual robot code in Gazebo Simulation?

I am working on Guardian mobile robot. It has 2 ROS packages, one for real robot and other for Gazebo simulation.
Mapping and navigation code is available in real robot package and not in Gazebo simulation package. Please tell, how can I run mapping and navigation code in Gazebo package. Thanks

A:

If you are using the packages from here (you didn't say, so I had to guess), then there are launch files available for starting the navigation stack in the guardian_sim packages. For example, guardian_ros_pkg/guardian_sim/guardian_nav/launch/move_base_sim.launch.

Thanks for your answer, I am using ROS Indigo and for Indigo version guardian_sim folder downloaded from https://github.com/RobotnikAutomation/guardian_sim does not contain guardian_nav package. The Guardian packages link you shared also supports ROS Hydro.

Error is:
