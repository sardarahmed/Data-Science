Q:

Does Docker provide a full Ubuntu GUI development environment like VirtualBox for ROS Noetic

I can't seem to find a proper answer to this question by reading through Docker documentation.
If Docker is touted as a lighter alternative to VMs installed via tools like VirtualBox, does it provide the full Ubuntu GUI development environment for ROS Noetic (for example)?
There's an older question on this, but the answers given don't make it seem like Docker provides a GUI dev environment natively. But rather through a bunch of different add-ons.
I'm not an advanced ROS developer, so I don't want the hassle of not having the "vanilla" ROS dev environment of a "vanilla" Ubuntu OS with full GUI.
If someone can confirm that Docker can't support GUI dev environment natively, then I'd rather stick to using VirtualBox.

A:

No GUI environment exists that I know of. Assuming your on a Linux based system you can just mount your x11 directory and set your display variable.
For example:
First step enter the console command
xhost +

Start a basic ubuntu docker container with the x11 volume mounted and the env variable set.
docker run -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --env DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} ubuntu bash

Now in the container install xapps (since base image has no gui based tools)
apt update && apt install -y x11-apps

and test using
xeyes

You can even do this with GPU support using the Nvidia container toolkit.  For Mac and Windows this I believe you just use XQuartz or VcXsrv Windows X Server
Typically I prefer using docker compose for settings these variables and launching/building my containers.
