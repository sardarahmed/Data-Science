Q:

Unable to set up keys while installing ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

I follow the instructions from here: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu but in the "set up your keys" step
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

i get this:
Executing: /tmp/tmp.uIulXAU9Vn/gpg.1.sh --keyserver
hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80
--recv-key
421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
gpg: requesting key B01FA116 from hkp server ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net
?: ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net: Host not found
gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: Success
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: keyserver communications error: keyserver unreachable
gpg: keyserver communications error: public key not found
gpg: keyserver receive failed: public key not found

I searched and found many answers but i think none of them solve this problem.

A:

Maybe it is because you're behind an http proxy. So other ports aren't working and some http tools are unaware of it.

So are you behind a proxy server?
Comment by moshimojo on 2017-04-17:
i'm sorry for the delay. In the network settings it says i am not.
Comment by eugene.katsevman on 2017-04-17:
can you try sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116 instead?
Comment by moshimojo on 2017-04-17:
Oh it says "imported". But in the next step sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
Comment by moshimojo on 2017-04-17:
it gives me an error. It says i have held broken packages and non of the packages has been installed
Comment by eugene.katsevman on 2017-04-17:

Comment by moshimojo on 2017-04-17:

it's the same
Comment by eugene.katsevman on 2017-04-17:
Since the key is imported, it seems you have a different problem now and I think it is unrelated to ros. Please, open new question with the exact description of the current problem.
Comment by eugene.katsevman on 2017-04-17:
btw, what's your linux distribution ?
Comment by moshimojo on 2017-04-18:
