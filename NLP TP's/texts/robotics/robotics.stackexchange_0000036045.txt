Q:

Cant get data from Create robot - Error reading from SCI port ttyUSB0

Hi all,
in the turtlebot-dashboard all the sensors are Stale apart from the Laptop battery one, and when I do roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch I get the code below. Weird thing is it worked perfectly yesterday; then I played with Kinect drivers and then it stopped working. So I did a fresh ubuntu install on the turtlebot laptop but I still get the same!
Turtlebot is on and light is green by the way so there is plenty of power. I've also checked /etc/udev/rules.d/52-turtlebot.conf and it has read and write rules (666). I also checked dmesg and the turtlebot is on ttyUSB0. I can also see the leds on the irobot cable light up in both directions so there is traffic.
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

I did sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0 but still no luck :-(
Comment by karthik on 2011-11-28:
Try setting the permissions to ttyUSB* and check it this works.
Comment by karthik on 2011-11-28:
I presume It should be either the permissions or the hardware. If not lets wait for some one to share their thoughts.

Comment by chopchop on 2011-11-28:
I ran dmesg and it confirmed that the turtlebot is connected to ttyUSB0, which is the one the minimal.launch is looking for it; so I reckon it should be ok 'usb 2-1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0'

Thanks I've edited the question

Could you post the information in the log file mentioned in the error.

turned out my cable was faulty...
