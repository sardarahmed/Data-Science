Q:

Interprete PointCloud2 messages of Kinect

Hi everyone,
how do I get the distance values out of the PointCloud2 message produced by a Kinect sensor efficiently? At the moment I use a loop iterating all points and writing the z-value to a file.
Thanks for your help
Sebastian

A:

Take a look at the pcl_ros tutorials; this will get you a PCL point cloud, rather than a ROS PointCloud2; the PCL version comes with all kinds of useful gadgetry.
