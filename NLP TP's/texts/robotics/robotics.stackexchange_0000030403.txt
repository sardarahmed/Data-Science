Q:

ROS install Yaml error on OSX

Ive been trying to install ROS and have been given this error at the end of running:
rosinstall ~/ros "http://packages.ros.org/cgi-bin/gen_rosinstall.py?rosdistro=diamondback&variant=desktop-full&overlay=no"
ERROR:
import yaml
ImportError: No module named yaml

I already run the sudo easy_install -U pyyaml command and that seemed fine but i still end up with this error any ideas?
Thanks

A:

Make sure you have pyyaml installed against your active version of python.
There was a thread on ros-users here which is similar.
I believe that you might need to make sure you're using the right version of easy_install as mentioned here
