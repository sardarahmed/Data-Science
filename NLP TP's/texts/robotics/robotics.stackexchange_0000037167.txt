Q:

Using multiple arduinos / running multiple nodes

Hi, I have two arduinos (Uno and Duemilanove) and I want to use the two of them in parallel on one machine. However, rosserial_python does not accept multiple /dev files as parameters, so I cannot give the addresses of both arduinos to one rosserial_python node.
The other option is running multiple rosserial_python nodes with each having different parameters, but ROS does not allow that since there are multiple nodes with the same name. It should be possible to run multiple nodes on one machine, but I don't know how. Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!

A:

Renaming the nodes should work, but you may find it more convenient to run each robot in a separate namespace.
That can be done in roslaunch using the ns attribute of the <node> or <group> tags. Or, directly with rosrun using the ROS_NAMESPACE environment variable.
