Q:

Gazebo not loading moving joints

Hi! I am trying to spawn a urdf file on gazebo but it looks like gazebo is only reading fixed joints. If I change all my moving joints to fixed I can see a tf tree published on the tf topic but if I change back to moving joints it only publishes fixed ones. The spawned model just vibrates while moving the moving joints around randomly. Please help!

Thanks hsu it really helps a lot. I got another problem though, when I run my launch file which launches a whole lot of stuff I get these errors: 1. Could not initialize chain object, 2. Could not load models. Any ideas? Thanks

A:

Non-fixed joints are not published to tf-tree by default.  One way to do this is to rely on the gazebo_ros_controller_manager plugin.  To make this work you have to provide <transmission> elements to your model for each non-fixed joints.
Or you can write a gazebo plugin to publish tf transforms for non-fixed joints, which might be a handy plugin to have around (or ticket this as a feature request).
