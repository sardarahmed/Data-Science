Q:

books / examples / tutorials for Kinetic Kame

Hello,
As a new learner to ROS I haven't seen literature such as books for Kinetic Kame, I'm interested in the Ros by Example book specifically but it is for Indigo.  Is it ok to use it for Kinetic Kame?
Thanks

A:

There are some small changes between distributions. Each rosdistro has a Migration guide. Like kinetic/Migration so you can know about big things that changed.
