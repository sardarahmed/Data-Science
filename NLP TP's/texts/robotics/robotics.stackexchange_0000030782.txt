Q:

Loading 2D raw data

Hello,
I've obtained a 2D map from another development environment, how could I load/display/manipulate (in gazebo/rviz) this set of 2D points.
Thank you.

What format is your map in ?

A:

I think the simplest way is to write your map to a .pgm file. I guess a simple program can do it. It has to map the occupied points to black pixels (value=0), the free points to white pixels (254) and unknown points to gray pixels (205).
Then you can use the map_server package to publish it to rviz with the command:
rosrun map_server map_server mymap.pgm
If you set the fixed frame as "/map" in rviz, you should see your map.
Hope this helps,
Guido

I've plot my map in Matlab, saved it in .tif and convert it into .pgm. The map is successfully loaded into RViz . Thank you!

I know this is an old thread, but I cant get this method to work. I have the pgm file on my desktop, and I run  rosrun map_server map_server mymap.pgm, but it cant open the file. Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks!

I used rosrun map_server map_server rospack find <my_map_package>/mymap.yaml.
Be sure you have the correct file_path within the argument for your mymap.yaml

The command is rosrun map_server map_server mymap.yaml not rosrun map_server map_server mymap.pgm
