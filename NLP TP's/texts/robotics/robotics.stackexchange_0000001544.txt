Q:

Arduino C/C++ progamming tutorials

I have no problem in reading circuit schemes, connecting wires, resistors etc. (basing on for example instructables.com), but I've only tried to learn Java (a while ago) and it's difficult to me to find out what's going on with all this C-code-stuff.
Are there any tutorials that are focused on the programming part?
thanks

A:

 A great way to learn C/C++ for arduino is by going to the website: ardx.org/CIRC01

This website is completely and gives great mini projects that involve electronics and then gives an example code and a great explanation of how the code works. This site consists of 11 projects and explains the basics of C/C++ for arduino, it also teaches you how to read schematics and data sheets. After you are done with project #1 change the CIRC01 at the end of url to CIRC02, and each time you complete a project continue to go to the next one by changing the # on the end of the CIRC to a higher # until you get to 11. By the time you get to project #11 you should have a good understanding of programming for arduino and a better understanding of electronics as well. Another way that I learned C++ is by reading the book "C++ for Dummies by Stephen R. Davis". This book teaches C++ in a simple yet affective fashion, however it is quite tedious to completely read this book, if it were me I would start by using the projects on ardx.org and then once I have finished all the projects and if I wanted even more knowledge on programming c/C++ then read the book. Good luck!
