Q:

hector_quadrotor: how does quadrotor_simple_controller runs?

Hi Everyone:
In the link http://wiki.ros.org/hector_quadrotor_controller?distro=fuerte, it says Simple Quadrotor Controller plugin implements the controller of the quadrotor. But I do not understand how it runs as a plugin. It seems that it is not compiled and linked into a node, but Gazebo automatically starts it because quadrotor_simple_controller.urdf.xacro was included somewhere in a launch file.
I wonder if some one can give me an idea of how it runs?
Thank you in advance
Kind Regards
Yucong

A:

The wiki pages of the hector_quadrotor stack were a bit outdated, as we moved some plugins from one package to another during the transition from fuerte to groovy to hydro. I am sorry. I updated the wiki a couple of minutes ago.
You will find the simple controller plugin for Gazebo in the hector_quadrotor_gazebo_plugins package now. The plugin does not invoke a real controller that outputs motor voltages, but only generates pseudo forces and torques that make the simulated quadrotor look and behave like a real one.
The hector_quadrotor_controller package was originally meant for our more fancy real-time controller also running on the real vehicle, but I have not found the time yet to integrate it in gazebo properly.
Please add comments here if there are further questions.

How do I use the packages to autonomously control the hector_quadrotor? Suppose I want it to take off an autonomously explore an unknown map? @[Johannes Meyer}
