Q:

How to define goal in RVIZ through python script

Hello,
I am working on turtlebot 3 and i am trying to derive goal for robot through python script so user dont need to direct navigation goal over again n again. I tried to view move_base topic it only retrieves result once, for instance i want to direct navigation goal once and should look for msg itself based on script.
Any help ?

A:

You can send navigation goals as follows:
from geometry_msgs.msg import Pose, Point, Quaternion

goal = MoveBaseGoal()
goal.target_pose.pose = Pose(Point(1.5, -4.85, 0), Quaternion(0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.77))
goal.target_pose.header.frame_id = "map" 
goal.target_pose.header.stamp = rospy.Time() 
self.sac.send_goal(goal, active_cb=self.active_callback, done_cb=self.done_callback, feedback_cb=self.feedback_callback)

You can define the callback functions, which you provide while sending the goal, as follows:
def done_callback(self):
     rospy.loginfo("done callback")

The rest is up to you.
