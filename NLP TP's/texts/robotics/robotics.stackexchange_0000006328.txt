Q:

language to code Beaglebone

I'm trying to build a hexapod with beaglebone in the linux environment (Im thinking of using Ubuntu). What is the best language to use for coding purpose to make robot controls, camera and wifi integration etc.

A:

As one user has said, ROS is a very good framework for robotics platforms that supports python and c++. I highly recommend downloading the VirtualBox image of ROS and giving it a try, it takes about 5 minutes excluding download.
ROS will give you a communication framework between machines on a network, and also between subsystems on the robot (mobility, state estimation, vision, etc). Included in ROS is the Computer Vision library OpenCV which may interest you if you are using a camera to sense some state or parameter. 
In addition to ROS, I can recommend Simulink for your algorithmic development. Simulink is a simulation environment with very useful pre-validated libraries. After simulating and validating your module, you can compile it into C/C++, then put that into ROS so that your I/O is handled by ROS.
I use this for almost all kinematic or dynamic systems because it speeds up development significantly, although I avoid doing any I/O directly in Simulink.
