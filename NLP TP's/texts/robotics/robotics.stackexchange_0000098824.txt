Q:

Publishing the data from BAG file

I am trying to learn ROS and filtering of point cloud.
I performed some tutorials on the same. However now I am stuck that the data from node for bag file is not getting published. Please refer to the data from rostopic list -v

I have used kitti2bag to convert to bag file.
Below the commands used by me to run the package
roscore
rosrun nodelet nodelet standalone velodyne_pointcloud/TransformNodelet
rosrun beginner_tutorials all_velo input:=/velodyne_points
rosbag play -l kitti_2011_09_26_drive_0002_synced.bag

In rqt_graph I cannot see a topic from the node corresponding to rosbag
I believe this is why I cannot convert the pointcloud.
I am not sure where I am making mistake.

Hi,
Can you write in a more understandable way what exactly you are trying to do?
Can you write again your steps? (e.g. "roscore" "roslaunch.." "rosbag play..")

A:

I got it fixed. I was not subscribing correct topic on all_velo. After changing the
rosrun beginner_tutorials all_velo input:=/kitti/velo/pointcloud. It started working.
