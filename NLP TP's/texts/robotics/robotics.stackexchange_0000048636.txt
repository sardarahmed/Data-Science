Q:

How can I use ROS data to create a GUI?

Dear All,
My robot is a quad walker with Kinect and controlled by Arduino. The ROS will read the data from Kinect and then record the related x, y ordinate. But I have no idea for how can I use those data to create a node in graphic user interface. Should I use TCP/IP method send those data to client and build the GUI in that computer. Or I should use Matlab or Labview to build the GUI in Ubuntu directly. Which method should be easier.
Thank you very much.

I want to understand what is behind this goal " But I have no idea for how can I use those data to create a node in graphic user interface."
Thanks

A:

ROS already provides a GUI for that: rviz

Also, http://ros.org/wiki/rqt is nice, if you want to add your own custom information.
