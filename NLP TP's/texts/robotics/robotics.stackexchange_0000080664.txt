Q:

How to configure communication with arduino

Hi,
I'm trying to configure the communication using rosserial to arduino and to install everything.
I followed this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
and am trying to finish this one http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World
Here is the error I am getting, I just cannot locate serial_node.py anywhere on my computer!

rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named serial_node.py below /opt/ros/indigo/share/rosserial_python

I couldn't find anyone having the same issue, any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you very much!

A:

I solved this issue, but now I cannot run helloworld for another reason:
sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/Esp8266Hardware.h:36:25: fatal error: ESP8266WiFi.h: No such file or directory
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
