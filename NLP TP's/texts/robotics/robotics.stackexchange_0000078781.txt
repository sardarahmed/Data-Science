A:

ROS uses SI units for everything, so also in URDF (for link lengths) and for meshes. See REP-003, section Units.
You'll have to make sure your meshes use metres as scale. Meshes exported by CAD tools often use millimetres, so they will be a 1000 times too large.

If you don't want to or can't scale your meshes, you could use the scale attribute on the mesh element in your urdf. See wiki/urdf/XML/link - Elements for more information.
