Q:

Are Darpa Robotic Challenge Simulator and DRC-based Gazebo a part of ROS Fuerte?

Are the DRC Simulator and DRCGazebo updates a part of ROS Fuerte?
When updates to DRC Gazebo and the DRC Simulator occur, are both DRC Gazebo and the DRC simulator also updated for ROS Fuerte?
If so, how do I update the latest Gazebo and simulator in Fuerte?
It would be nice to use the latest Gazebo and simulator advances in the ROS environment.

A:

There is a question on the gazebosim site that seems to be similar.  I would suggest taking a look at it here: http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/246/drcsim-which-ros-versions-will-be-supported/
