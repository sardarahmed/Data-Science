Q:

Building hector_quadrotor failed

Hi, I have installed ROS and Gazebo and I tried to build this project:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/hector_quadrotor/Tutorials/Quadrotor%20indoor%20SLAM%20demo

After I executing

rosmake hector_quadrotor_demo

All things work well unless I meet these errors:

If I continue executing

roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo
indoor_slam_gazebo.launch

I will get this error:

[hector_quadrotor_demo]

Can somebody help me? Thank you very much.

Comment by Alex Buyval on 2013-02-04:
Which version of ROS have you installed?  Have you done initialize rosdep?

A:

Hi, @Alex Buyval, I have got the answer from ROS Q&A Forum. Anyway, thank you for your quick response.
The respondent on ROS Q&A Forum said that information about required stacks was indeed incomplete in the tutorials. And he has added the missing stacks in the prerequisites section.
Hope this can help guys who meet the same problem. For more details, please see:
