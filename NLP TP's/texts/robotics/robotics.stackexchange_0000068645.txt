Q:

Basic Int32 and std_msgs question

I'm very new to working in Ros.  I am trying to figure out how to read from a bag file and so I'm interested in making a small bag file for testing purposes.  I have wrapped the code for writing the integer 42 inside a main function and attempted to run it within a catkin package using catkin_make.  I get the following error:
[ 81%] Building CXX object test/CMakeFiles/test_write_bag.dir/src/test_write_bag.cpp.o
/home/ryan/catkin_ws/src/test/src/test_write_bag.cpp: In function ‘int main(int, char**)’:

make[1]: *** [test/CMakeFiles/test_write_bag.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make -j1 -l1" failed

Does anyone know what I've done wrong or forgotten to set up within the project?

A:

Did you #include <std_msgs/Int32.h> along with your other headers?
