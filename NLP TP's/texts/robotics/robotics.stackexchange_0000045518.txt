Q:

functions to modify an octomap

Now I have an octomap in the form of .bt file, and I am able to read and translate it as an OcTree. I hope to rotate or move this octomap with respect to global frame and write it out as .bt file. Are there any functions or examples I can look into?  I was reading the documentation of Pose6D and Vector3 but had no idea how to connect these two classes with OcTree.
Thanks!

A:

The Pose6D defines a transformation. What you'd basically have to do:

Create a new empty OcTree
Iterate over your OcTree's cells
For each cell:

Transform its coordinates using your transform
Insert this cell at the transformed coordinates into the empty OcTree

However, this is very inefficient and at the same time the only way of doing that in principle. You'll need to identify your use case for that to decide if you really need to do this, otherwise, follow @jj56's advice.
