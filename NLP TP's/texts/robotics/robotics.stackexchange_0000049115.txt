Q:

defining serial ports

For all my current drivers it seems they use 'ttyUSB#' for reading inputs (see example below)
def init(self, default_port='/dev/ttyUSB0'):
What are the definitions for reading other port types (especially UART)?
or, a link to a reference?

A:

It obviously depends on the device.
UARTs you'll usually find at /dev/ttyS*
Some devices as Hokuyos or newer Arduinos also show up at /dev/ttyACM*.

This is good information. Are these and other different port address schemes documented somewhere? It would be good to know the reference.

AFAIK not in general as it depends on the driver what devices that one brings up. There might be some official overview, though.

In most cases it's also quite simple to figure out: Check dmesg output before and after plugging a device. There should be some message with the /dev/... if there is one. This doesn't work with anything that is already connected to the system like a COM port.
