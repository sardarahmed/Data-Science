Q:

I copied a workspace and now catkin_make doesn't work

I created a workspace catkin_ws_01 and created some packages inside it.
Then I duplicated that same workspace folder to create catkin_ws_02 and made some changes to the packages inside. Then I deleted the original workspace folder catkin_ws_01.
Now when I try to run catkin_make from inside catkin_ws_02, it gives me the following error message:
CMake Error: The source directory "/home/blabla/catkin_ws_01/src" does not exist.
This means that catkin_make still refers to catkin_ws_01 even though I am executing the command from within catkin_ws_02.
What is going on and how can I fix this?

Have you copied the compiled folders (build and devel)?
I would remove these folders and try to compile again
I don't think the compilation problem is related to that, but it's also important to check your .bashrc file and remove any sourcing command of your old catkin_ws_01 workspace.

@ahendrix I'm sorry, when I deleted the question I didn't even realize that there had already been an answer.

A:

I'm using ROS Indigo distribution, I have tried to do the same in my computer and I got the following error:
CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/marcoarruda/catkin_02/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/marcoarruda/catkin_01/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt

Then, I have removed the folders build and devel from catkin_02 and tried to compile again. It worked!
I don't think the compilation problem is related to that, but it's also important to remove any source catkin_01/devel/setup.bash instruction (maybe you have added to your .bashrc file)
I've created a video showing the steps to reproduce and solve it (https://youtu.be/Lg_oM4vFIEs).

Thanks, the build and devel folders were exactly the issue! After deleting them, building worked as expected :)
