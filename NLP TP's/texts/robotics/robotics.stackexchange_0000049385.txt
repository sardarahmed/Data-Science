Hi,
You can have different distributions installed and make them work.
It depends on the setup.bash which your .bashrc calls
In the link below, in section 1.5 Environment setup, you can find instructions on how you can have multiple distributions ans set them up for use.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu
Basically whenever a new terminal pops up, .basrc file is called. So if you source the setup of electric or fuerte in .bashrc file, the corresponding distribution is used.

To open the .bashrc file, type sudo gedit  .bashrc then add the following line at the end   source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash . Remember to close the terminal and open new one so that the .bashrc file is called. This will setup the termina to fuerte distribution

I already have source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash... Is this cause any problem ?

i am not sure, but if want to use fuerte, better thing would be to comment the groovy and add fuerte
