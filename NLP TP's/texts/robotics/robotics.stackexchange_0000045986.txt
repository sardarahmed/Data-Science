Q:

HMD suggestions for usage with ROS software

Hello all,
I'm searching for an HMD (head-mounted display) to use for stereoscopic vision and pan&tilt camera control using IMU readings.
As such, the requirements are:

Good resolution and stereocopic view;
Compatibility with ubuntu;
IMU incorporated.

Also, if you have any experience with some HMD and you use ROS, can you point how you use sterescopic view from 2 different image sources in ROS? There are many methods and I'd like to know which ones you use.
Thank you in advance,
Filipe Jesus
