Q:

indoor positioning system: which is better?

Which method is better, in term of accuracy, for detection of indoor localization of a drone. Camera based system or wireless techniques like WLAN or Bluetooth?

A:

Definitely camera based options, however, I would go with IR sensors or some even some sound-based sensors if you want a really specific measurement.
