Q:

can't find linkage dependency

Hi,
I am trying to compile my package but I am getting the following error:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgripper_click_ui
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

In my manifest I have the following two dependencies which possibly give me the hard time but it should be including the missing library:
<depend package="pr2_gripper_click"/>
<depend package="pr2_pick_and_place_demos"/>

This error occurs when I run make or rosmake. I am using diamondback.
Any clues?
Many thanks.

How have you installed the pr2_object_manipulation stack? Which version of linux are you using?

A:

The gripper_click_ui library should be in the pr2_gripper_click package.
Try running 'rosmake pr2_gripper_click'
