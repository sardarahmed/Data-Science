Q:

turtlebot navigation using uwb

Hello everyone. I am using turtlebot 3 burger with kinetic and ubuntu 16.04. I am using ultra wide band sensor for positioning of robot. I have transmitters and a receiver. The receiver in connected with raspberry pi via usb. I am able make a python code which will calculate the distance from each anchor and give me two readings, i-e x and y. The code runs in pi and not in my PC where i have ros master. Now i want to access this data in ros and use it for naavigation. How can i do that? I am not very experienced in ros, so any help/tutorial will be of great help.
