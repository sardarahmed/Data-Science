Q:

Error while running MIT demos

Dear ROS gurus,
I've been working on the MIT demo examples for quite a while now. I'm trying to run the hand interaction demo. When I do the following:
roslaunch hand_interaction hand_detector.launch

I get the following errors in the console:

I am using ubuntu 10.10, Maverick, i am testing the MIT demo on the DIAMOND version of ROS. I dont know what is libusb version, I am considering that this libusb is installed during the installation of the ROS. I think ....this might be the error, how do i install libusb
Comment by Murph on 2011-04-18:
What operating system are you using? Which distribution and version? Also, the version of libusb might be helpful.

A:

No idea what makes openni_node crash, but the skel_tracker node crashes because it cannot find the OpenNI configuration XML file that it's trying to load (see line 397 in skeletal_tracker/src/main.cpp).
This probably should be reported to the package maintainer.
Edit: I just found this other answer that proposes a solution: http://answers.ros.org/question/688/skeletal_tracker-crashes
