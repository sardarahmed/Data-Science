A:

Edit (2019-11-12): rosserial has long since been released for Kinetic (and Melodic). If possible try to use apt to install it (but make sure to be using a supported OS+platform combination (ie: amd64,  arm64 or armhf with Debian or Ubuntu), check the status pages):
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rosserial

(replace $ROS_DISTRO with your version of ROS, ie: kinetic or melodic)

Original answer: it will be eventually on the repositories so you can install it using apt-get install
according to:  https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/223
In any case you can download the code to any of your catkin workspaces and build it:
 mkdir -p rosserial_ws/src 
 cd rosserial_ws/src  
 git pull https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial
 cd .. 
 catkin_make
