Q:

reconfigure parameters for uvc_camera or uvc_cam2

Hi all,
I would like to use the uvc_camera driver but the image has some weird coloring. It seems that the parameters are not right. Therefore, I found would like to adjust them.
I found a post here were someone says that he uses the dynamic_reconfigure tool. But when i tried to use it were just the jpg quality an adjustable parameter and nothing more.
So I used ucvdynctrl (which is kind of awkward to use) and I after an hour of trail and error I still don't have a good setting. I would be glad if someone could?would share their parameter for a Logitech c920.
Additionally: I saw the option of different pixelformats when I launch the package. But how can I select them. There is no pixelformat parameter.
Would be great to get your help.

thank you! that is excellently what I was looking for. Do you know how I set the mjpeg compression for the uvc_driver? Its easily done in guvcview but I coundn't find a solution for the uvc_camera package...

A:

You may try guvcview - GUI for UVC cameras. It is possible that something wrong with White Balance options. Mine WB Temperature is set automatically to 5300, just to give you the reference.
