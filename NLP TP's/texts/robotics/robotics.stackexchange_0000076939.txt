Q:

I have errors trying to catkinize MIDG II package

I am trying to catkinize a package I found on Github to run my "Microrobotics MIDG II INS/GPS" sensor on ROS.
I used "catkinize" and follwed the instructions to edit my CMakeList and package files.
After finishing all steps I am getting this error messge and I couldn't find any help to fix it.
...
midgPacket.cpp:(.text+0xa15): undefined reference to `ros::console::setLogLocationLevel(ros::console::LogLocation*, ros::console::levels::Level)'
midgPacket.cpp:(.text+0xa1f): undefined reference to `ros::console::checkLogLocationEnabled(ros::console::LogLocation*)'
midgPacket.cpp:(.text+0xa6a): undefined reference to `ros::console::print(ros::console::FilterBase*, void*, ros::console::levels::Level, char const*, int, char const*, char const*, ...)'

My CMakeList file:

include_directories(include ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIR} ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${GSTREAMER_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(Midg src/Midg_II.cpp src/drivers/midgPacket.cpp)
add_dependencies(Midg ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

There are many of the "undefined reference to..." messages showing up before the error message
Any help?

Please use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) to format things like console text, contents of CMakeLists.txt, compiler errors and code snippets.
Please use the edit button/link (below your question) to fix the formatting.
Thanks.

Also: when posting CMakeLists.txt (thanks for that btw, always a good idea when posting compiler and/or linker errors), please remove all the boilerplate comments from them (lines starting with #).

A:

Solved, I created a new driver for MIDG II INS/GPS sensor that works on any platform that supports ROS.
