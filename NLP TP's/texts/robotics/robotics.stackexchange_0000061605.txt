Q:

MoveIt: get current desired end effector pose

Hello there,
I am trying to get access to the current desired end effector's transform output by MoveIt (actually my goal is to compute the tracking error). My feeling is that I need to do the following steps:

Get the desired joint angles from MoveIt
Parse the urdf (to build a direct geometric model), or is there a package which computes the direct geometric model of the robot out of its urdf?
Compute the end effector's desired transform from the geometric model and the desired joint angles

Am I right?
Now a question more related to code:
I guess the desired joint angles are provided by moveit in topic /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal, no? This topic is of type control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectoryActionGoal (api in ROS Kinetic). I also guess the trajectory is in field goal.trajectory.points.positions. fields points and positions are arrays: do you know how I should interpret them? Also does the fact that these are arrays mean that the whole desired trajectory is sent at one and not per small time steps?
Thansk!
Antoine.

A:

Could be just English wording, but I guess by "desired" you mean "commanded", or the order MoveIt! sends to ROS network. If I'm right, then you basically get things right I think.

If 'commanded', then yes (although this would be at the level MoveIt<->controller, not controller<->hw). If 'current', then no.
