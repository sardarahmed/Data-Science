Q:

Remove slider bar from dynamic_reconfigure

For doubles and Ints I'd like to remove slider bar from the dynamic reconfigure to only be able to change values via the text  box. For long lists of values I find myself often accidentally bumping the slider (when scrolling with mouse).
Would this difficult to do? I haven't looked too deep into the dyn_reconf code to see whats possible. Any recommendations?

A:

You can try create an issue here but it seems the maintainer rather busy at a time so maybe you can change the GUI source code yourself, do pull request so other can use that feature. Try use USB mouse rather than laptop's touch mouse.
