A:

The cmvision package looks like it's set up to do this fairly well.
It's documented on the ROS Wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/cmvision
And they also have a nice tutorial
Note that, because ROS nodes communicate over standardized messages, you should be able to use any of the vision processing nodes with any of the camera drivers.
