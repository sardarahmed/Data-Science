Q:

Gazebo/Boost 'Host not found' error

Hi,
I installed Gazebo 1.0.1 (from May 15, 2012) with all required dependencies on Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric, 64-bit).
I get the following error when launching gzserver:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::exception_detail::clone_implboost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::system::system_error >'
what(): Host not found (authoritative)
Aborted
The same error was reported on ArchLinux but didn't find a clear answer (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=20839)
I changed the environment variable GAZEBO_MASTER_URI to 'http://127.0.0.1:12345' as advised and could successfully launch gazebo but the Plugin_CgProgramManager.so file was reported missing. I then quit gazebo and try to install the ogre-plugins-cgprogrammanager package, which contains the missing plugin file, after installing the nvidia-cg-toolkit package. It failed as the only available version of ogre-plugins-cgprogrammanager (1.6.4) is older than libogre-1.7.3 that is already installed.
Since then, I tried to launch gzserver or gazebo again and I get the error mentioned above, again, whether GAZEBO_MASTER_URI is set to the default 'http://localhost:11345' or to the recommended 'http://127.0.0.1:12345'.
I have two problems:

The 'Host not found error' when using Boost (1.46.1)
The missing Plugin_CgProgramManager.so in /usr/lib/OGRE/.

There is one possible solution I haven't investigated yet: installing Gazebo from the source files posted on ArchLinux and that are more up-to-date than the Debian binary on the Gazebo website (May 18 v. May 15).
If anyone has faced the same problem, thank you for your help.

A:

Everything was solved after updating the whole system with apt-get and installing missing packages from the PPA of Ogre as described in this other thread:
