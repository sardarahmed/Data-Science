Q:

No rule to make target

I'm trying to create my own package. But until to catkin_make step it shows that:
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/home/leddar/catkin_ws/src/leddar/readleddar/Readleddar.cpp', needed by `leddar/CMakeFiles/Readleddar.dir/readleddar/Readleddar.cpp.o'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [leddar/CMakeFiles/Readleddar.dir/all] Error 2
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

it's this due to I'm missing some of the important step during roscreate-pkg? Or something else?
Thank you so much.

does the file /home/leddar/catkin_ws/src/leddar/readleddar/Readleddar.cpp exist? This will be easier to debug if you edit your question to include your CMakeLists.txt and the list of files in your package.

A:

I found out my problem. it's too stupid. I just simply forget to add the executable and target to CMakeLists.txt. After I add them add in, and the problem solved.
thank you.
