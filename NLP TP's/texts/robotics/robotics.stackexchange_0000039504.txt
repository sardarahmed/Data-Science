Q:

Is it possible to remap topics at runtime?

I'm wondering if mappings are dynamic or handled centrally enough that it would be possible to remap a nodes topics at runtime without requiring specific support within the node.
I've seen a post on the old mailing list that suggested it was not supported, but I'm wondering more specifically if it's even feasible if one's inclined to dig below supplied tools.
Implicit question: how does remapping work under the hood?

A:

The current implementation is not capable of dynamically remapping.  I don't think that there's anything technically blocking this capability, though it will take a bunch of effort to do the book keeping and subscribe and unsubscribe and everything in a thread safe manner.  Also there's not really an API designed for it, but it definitely sounds like it might be a good enhancement to consider for future releases.
