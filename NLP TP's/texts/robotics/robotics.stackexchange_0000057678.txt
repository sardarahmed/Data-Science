Q:

rosls and roscd still missing

I just installed ros-hydro on Ubuntu 12.10 following the tutorial. But when I try to use the command rosls and roscd, it just says command not found. I tried source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash a lot of times and there is "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" in the ~/.bashrc. But rosls and roscd still can't use.

Stupid question: Do you use bash as your shell?
Comment by Thomaswang on 2014-03-06:
echo $SHELL returns "/bin/bash"
Comment by BennyRe on 2014-03-06:
What is the output of echo $SHELL
Comment by BennyRe on 2014-03-06:
From the information you kindly provided in your other question about the same topic what happens if you do sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rosbash?
Comment by Thomaswang on 2014-03-06:
Oh, yes, I works. I did installed the ros-hydro-desktop-full, I can't believe that it is not include rosbash. Thank you very much!!!
Comment by BennyRe on 2014-03-06:
Usually, this includes rosbash. Strange. I'll post it as an answer so you can mark the question as answered.

A:

Strangely rosbash hasn't been installed.
Run sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rosbash

I have closed the other question. It seems that I didn't install the full version or the install process was interrupted. I wonder if you can give me a list of the packages that I have to install to make my ROS to become a full version.
