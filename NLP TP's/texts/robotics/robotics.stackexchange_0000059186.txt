Q:

Where is wstool documented?

Taking .rosinstall file's format as an example, until I saw this ticket, I didn't know that it can specify branch to sync by version attribute. wstool --help didn't tell me (no wonder). I could find info about it neither on its ros wiki nor on the document page linked from wiki.
Thanks!

A:

I'm pretty sure it is not separately documented from rosinstall/rosws.
Most of the options for rosws apply, but unfortunately the -h option for it on the command line is probably the best documentation available for it.
