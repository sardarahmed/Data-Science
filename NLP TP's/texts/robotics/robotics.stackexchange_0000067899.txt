Q:

hector quadrotor catkin_make error

Hi
I was trying to build "hector_quadrotor_tutorial" by "catkin_make". Under worksapce directory, I enterned

catkin_make

it shows
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by"gazebo_ros_control" with any of the following names:

gazebo_ros_controlConfig.cmake
gazebo_ros_control-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros_control" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
set "gazebo_ros_control_DIR" to a directory containing one of the abovefiles.  If "gazebo_ros_control" provides a separate development package orSDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1

I already tried

source /devel/setup.bash

A:

its been solved in two steps,

reinstall libsdformat1.Because I removed "libsdformat" when I was trying to install sdformat.
$ sudo apt-get install libsdformat1

install unmet packages
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-control
