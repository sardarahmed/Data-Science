A:

For gmapping, you can check http://openslam.org/gmapping.html,
Giorgio Grisetti, Cyrill Stachniss, and Wolfram Burgard: Improved Techniques for Grid Mapping with Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, Volume 23, pages 34-46, 2007 (link)
and
Giorgio Grisetti, Cyrill Stachniss, and Wolfram Burgard: Improving Grid-based SLAM with Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters by Adaptive Proposals and Selective Resampling, In Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2005 (link)
For depthimage_to_laserscan you can visit its wiki and check the source code.
