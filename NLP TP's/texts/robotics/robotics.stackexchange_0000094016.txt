Q:

[ROS2] How to enable spdlog logger?

I know how to edit the logging format and logging level, but how to change the logger itself?
I was  searching and trying with rclcpp::InitOptions options = rclcpp::InitOptions(); and  rclcpp::init() but I couldn't find anything regarding changing the logger itself.
I think this would be a good addition to the ros2 tutorials also.
