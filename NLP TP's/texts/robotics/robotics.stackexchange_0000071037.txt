Q:

Pusblishing to topic problem (Mavros)

I'm trying to push to the override RC for mavros.
I checked the message type first
rostopic type mavros/rc/override
giving
mavros_msgs/OverrideRCIn
I then check the parameters for this message type
rosmsg show mavros_msgs/OverrideRCIn
giving
uint16 CHAN_RELEASE=0
uint16 CHAN_NOCHANGE=65535
uint16[8] channels
however, when I try to publish with
rostopic pub /mavros/rc/override mavros/OverrideRCIn "channels:[1500, 1500, 1500, 1500, 1325, 1560, 2000, 1500]"
it gives the following error
ERROR: invalid message type: mavros/OverrideRCIn.
If this is a valid message type, perhaps you need to type 'rosmake mavros'
am I passing the arguments wrong?

A:

mavros/ != mavros_msgs/!
Also check rc_io docs.
