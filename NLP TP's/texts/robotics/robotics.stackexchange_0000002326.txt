Q:

problem with simulated sensor in Matlab?

I'm simulating a sensor in 3D. The sensor should determine ($p, \theta, \phi$) from the origin  where $\theta$ is the rotation about z-axis and $\phi$ is the rotation about x-axis. The sensor is given position of a point($x, y, z$). This is what I did
    p = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2);
theta = acos(z/p);   <---- I'm guessing the problem here
  phi = atan2(y,x);

Now I need to get the Cartesian coordinates ($x',y',z'$). This is what I did
    [p theta phi] = getmeasurement(x, y, z);
    x' = p*cos(theta)*sin(phi);
    y' = p*sin(theta)*sin(phi);
    z' = p*cos(phi); 

The sensor is working fine at the beginning but at a particular point it behaves strangely. I have the state vector to compare it with the measurement. I'm guessing that $\theta$ might be the problem. 

Edit: 
I'm sorry for this mistake. The aforementioned calculations based on the following picture

So, the point will rotate first about z-axis ($\theta$) and then rotate about x-axis ($\phi$)

A:

I found the problem by switching the following
    p = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2);
  Phi = acos(z/p);   <---- Phi not Theta
Theta = atan2(y,x);  <---- Theta not Phi
