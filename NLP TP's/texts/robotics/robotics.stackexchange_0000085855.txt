Q:

roslaunch: [ ] is neither a launch file in package [ ] nor is [ ] a launch file name

Hi everyone,
I know a lot of answers to this kind of problem are lurking around, but I swear everything I tried isn't working. I've sourced the environment multiple times manually, or adding source/home/alexis/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash inside the ~./bashrc file. I am positive the folder and files do exist. I've also built it multiple times via catkin build or catkin_make.
But still, whenever I run the command:
roslaunch catkin_ws map_navigation_stage_psu.launch

the error that is in the title shows up. I honestly don't know what to do anymore.
The content of "map_navigation_stage_psu.launch" is as follow:
<launch>
      <include file="$(find catkin_ws)/src/turtlebot/navigation/map_navigation/launch/turtlebot_stage_psu.launch"/>
     <node name="map_navigation" pkg="catkin_ws" type="map_navigation_node" output="screen">
     </node>
</launch>

Thank you for bearing with me

A:

But still, whenever I run the command:

roslaunch catkin_ws map_navigation_stage_psu.launch

catkin_ws is the name of the directory that contains your Catkin workspace. It is not a package.
roslaunch can only find (and $(find ..)) packages, not workspaces.
Try replacing catkin_ws with the actual package name and see if that works any better.
Also:

source/home/alexis/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash inside the ~./bashrc file.

If this is not a typo, this line is missing a space between source and /home/alexis/...
