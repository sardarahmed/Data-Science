Q:

Will Collision monitor be backported to Humble?

Hi,
I just saw a pull request of Collision monitor on Nav2. It seems from docs that it will be supported from next ROS release (Iron).
I was wondering if it will be backported to Humble. This feature looks very attractive and will be very helpful.
Thanks!
