Q:

How to get laser data of Hokuyo UST-20LX

Hokuyo UST-20LX 's data interface is Ethernet 100base-TX. I have installed Hokuyo node, but Ethernet interface is not a serial port device, so the /dev/ttyACM0 didn't show up. Is there any drivers for that device under ROS? How can I get the data of UST-20LX?

Can you try urg_node?

A:

urg_node is the correct option.  Should be as simple as installing it (apt-get or what have you), and then running it, specifying an IP address.
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:=192.168.0.10  (the ip address is the factory default).
