Q:

Microstrain 3DM-GX3 and imu_drivers

This question is a follow-on to the question previously answered in the thread Any microstrain imu driver supporting 3DM-GX3 protocol?.
I have a Microstrain 3DM-GX3-25 AHRS and I'm hoping to use it with ROS Diamondback on Natty.  According to the closed thread, there is a patch under imu_drivers 1.2.4.  I just added the stack using apt three days ago but I can't verify the release version.  Looking at the stack, I can see the microstrain_3dmgx2_imu package.  Is this supposed to work for the 3DM-GX3?

You can determine the version of a stack easily by using the rosversion tool, rosversion imu_drivers 1.2.4 is the version released into diamondback see http://www.ros.org/wiki/imu_drivers/Releases

Okay, so I have it working so I guess that answers my question.  I was able to use the microstrain_3dmgx2_imu package directly following the tutorial.
I did verify the stack version was 1.2.4 using rosversion (thanks tfoote).
