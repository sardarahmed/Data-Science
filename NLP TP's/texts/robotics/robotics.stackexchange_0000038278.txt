Q:

ar_pose message subscriber

Hi, I am trying to write a simple subscriber in order to read the messages published by ar_pose (as in the example 4.4 of http://www.ros.org/wiki/ar_pose) but I am having some trouble in finding how to import in my c++ code the definition of the message used. In particular I can't find a way to import the definition of ar_pose::ARMarker.

Hi,
You can include these headers:
#include <ar_pose/ARMarker.h>

or
#include <ar_pose/ARMarkers.h>

depending if you want to work with a single or multiple markers.
The bag files in the ar_pose page are old, and have to be fixed with a command rosbag fix, there is also a problem with the frame transformations (check ar_pose track), therefore I would recommend you to print a marker and test it with an USB camera or other. I think it will be easier.
regards.
