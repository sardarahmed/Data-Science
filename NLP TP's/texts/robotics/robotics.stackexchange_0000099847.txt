You need to install the driver first.

Take a look at this package:   Drivers

https://github.com/ZiqiChai/k4a-ros or https://github.com/microsoft/Azure_Kinect_ROS_Driver

Is there any way to do it by using python ??

In your python subscribe to point cloud Topics.
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
import pcl
from sensor_msgs.msg import PointCloud2
import sensor_msgs.point_cloud2 as pc2
import ros_numpy

def callback(data):
    print(data)
    # Enter your code here

rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)
rospy.Subscriber("/<Your topic name>", PointCloud2, callback)
rospy.spin()
