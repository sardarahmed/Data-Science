Q:

p2os serial connection error

I am trying to connect to a Amigobot (similar to Pioneer) using the p2os stack. I am using an USB to Serial Converter in Ubuntu 10.11. I used rosparam set p2os/port /dev/ttyUSB0 to set the port to USB0. Unfortunatetly when I try to connect I get this error:
roslaunch p2os_launch p2os_driver.launch
... logging to /home/mario/.ros/log/cdf4ba1a-0bb0-11e2-8b6f-37e053dcb6c9/roslaunch-mario-Satellite-C660-12071.log

The output of the log file looks like this
^[[0m[ INFO] [1349093885.560391832]: using serial port: [/dev/ttyUSB0]^[[0m
^[[0m[ INFO] [1349093885.637932732]: P2OS connection opening serial port /dev/ttyUSB0...^[[0m

Maybe the baud rate is not correct? Do I have to set it manually?

Mario, I suspect that this is the same problem that we're trying to debug in this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/43375/p2os-connection/ Would you mind if I closed this as a duplicate so that we can combine efforts in one place?

A:

Yes you can close this post. Besides I was using a wrong port...
