Q:

RPLIDAR A2M8- Laser intensity values

Hi. I am subscribing to the Slamtech RPLIDAR'S intensity values but the values are either 0 or 47...I looked into the driver's code of the RPLIDAR in which the values of 0 and 47 are hard coded. I want real time intensity values instead of hardcoded values. Is there any way to do this?

A:

as i see in the protokoll spec of the scanner has no intensity output

I see..any other way i can get the intensity values by writing some piece of code in the driver part of the RPLIDAR? Or any other version of Slamtech RPLIDAR which has intensity value function?

I think, as this is the Protokoll between the sensors and Host , you are not able to change this behavior.

Do you know any other LIDAR which can output intensity values as well and is in the range of 400 -600 dollars?

you may try this
LDS-01 360 Laser Distance Sensor
if you look at the driver you see the data is read out from the sensor stream

Thanks a lot...any lidar with brushless motors? This one has a band attached

you may look at he
Sweep V1 360 it hast in the data stream 1byte for SignalStrenght

i fond the G4 from EAI YDLIDAR, it has an brushless motor and deliver the intensity values

and there is also a G6 http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/nezGEejW

Hi, sorry for the late reply..are you sure G4 from EAI provides intensity values because I just checked the datasheet and it says that intensity values are fixed to false
