Q:

How can Local_planner handle a Lidar blind spot

The lidar on my robot is on the front of the robot so the robot creates a blind spot behind the lidar. How can i get objects to not disappear on the local costmap when they go into the blind spot?
The lidar is reporting "inf" values in the blind spot.
I have track_unknown_space: true for the local_costmap

A:

you can try to set the parameter inf_is_valid: false . in this way the local costmap (or global) will not treat scans with "inf" values.
this is a quick fix, and you may have problems with not clearing the costmaps in front of the robot if your sensor outputs "inf" for scans farther than max_range, for example. in that case you might want to use a filter to correct that kind of measurements from your data as in here.
