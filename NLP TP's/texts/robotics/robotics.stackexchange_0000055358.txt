Q:

rospack can't find package created with catkin_create_package

I'm working through the beginner tutorials using ROS Hydro and I attempted to create my first package by running:
$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp

This produced no errors and appears to have created the associated files and folders.  However, using rospack to find the newly created package doesn't work:
$ rospack find beginner_tutorials 
[rospack] Error: stack/package beginner_tutorials not found

What am I missing?

A:

Did you create the package in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH? Try also to run 'rospack profile' before running the rospack find command.

What do you mean by " did you create the package in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"?
