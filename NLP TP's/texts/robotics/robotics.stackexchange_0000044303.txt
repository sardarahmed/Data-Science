A:

After having finished processing some kinect data, you can select "Save node wide" under the Graph menu to save all the point clouds making up the model as separate pcd files.  You can then obtain the transformations between the pointclouds by selecting "Save Trajectory Estimate" under Processing.  This will save a text file containing the transformations between camera poses.
