Q:

How to write a node to communicate with USB?

Using ROS I want to communicate with robot base which receives data through USB. So I want to write a ROS node that can write data on USB port.
Please help me.
can some one provide me python or C++ code for opening USB port, initializing it and to send the data on the port?

It is FTDI device. means the base is having a microcontroller based circuit for motor control. the microcontroller can actually handle RS-232 and the FTDI device converts RS-232 data in to packets of USB to support the communication.
I just need to send specific data to USB port.
