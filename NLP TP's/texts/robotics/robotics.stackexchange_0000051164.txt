Q:

How to get the graph resource name for a node?

Hi,
After launching a node, I can get its graph resource name using the rosnode info /node_name command line.
Is there a way to get this information Before launching the node?
As an example, suppose that I want info about turtlesim_node.  Currently, I have first to run it
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
Then I have to find out some how what is the name of the node I'm interested in, for example by using:
rosnode list
This will show me all running nodes. Knowing the previous list of running nodes, I can deduce that the new node is named /turtlesim. This way of doing it already annoys me. Is there a simpler way?
And once I have found the node name, I have still to use the rosnode command to have topics published and subscribed by my node
rosnode info /turtlesim
Again, this is heavy.
I wonder if I can have the names directly from the  turtlesim package without launching turtlesim_node?
Thanks

Can you clarify what information you want? It seems that you already have the node name.

I updated the question and provided an example. I can sum up the question as: Is there a way to find out the default node name and topic names before launching the node?

A:

There is not a way to statically determine what the name of a node is programmed to be.  However, you can set the node name on the command line using the command line remapping arguments.
