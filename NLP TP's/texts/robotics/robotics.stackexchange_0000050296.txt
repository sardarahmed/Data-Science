Q:

uvc_camera applies max values for brightness and contrast

I have been using uvc_camera to capture image streams in ROS before. It has changed its behavior recently and I can't figure out why or how to revert it.
When opening my capture device, rosrun uvc_camera camera_node _device:=/dev/video1, it will print out its parameters as usual. The parameters of interest are:
  int (Brightness, 0, id = 980900): -16 to 16 (1)
  int (Contrast, 0, id = 980901): 1 to 32 (1)
Looking at the stream with rosrun image_view image_view image:=image_raw shows an image that is by far too white, contradicting the zero values for both brightness and contrast. Looking at the camera device, after turning of the uvc_camera node, with guvcview shows that the Brightness and Contrast parameters are set to their max values, 16 and 32, respectively.
Using the same application, guvcview, I can revert the parameters to their default values. However, when turning on the uvc_camera node again, the image will again be too white.
As I mentioned, I have used uvc_camera before on the same and other webcams. The faulty behavior does not change when changing webcams.
I am stuck here, any suggestions on how to get a proper image stream are more than welcome.

A:

My current workaround is to use gscam: "http://ros.org/wiki/gscam". It does not provide an easy configuration of device and settings, but it at least doesn't apply incorrect settings.
