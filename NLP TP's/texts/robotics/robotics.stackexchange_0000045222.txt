Q:

Order of published/subscribed messages

Hi!
I have a single publisher and a single subscriber. The publisher is publishing at short intervals.
Is there ensured that the messages arrive in order or do i have to care about it myself?
Is there an option to force sending in order?
Thanks!
Jonas

A:

For a single publisher single subscriber system they should all be ordered, but not guaranteed to all be there depending on your queue size.  If you have multiple publishers the should be relative ordering from the individual publisher, but no guarantees between two publishers on ordering.
