Q:

reverse kinetic

Hi,
I would like to know in which way I could do the next things with ros :
I have generated an xyz robot trajectory dependant on a time chart I would like  the robot will do. (for each ms an xyz point is provided)
1/ how to make reverse kinematic and know the position of each axis of the robot ?
2/ I want being able to simulate it. how ?
Regarding 1/ : in real world there are some parameters like inertie, speeds .... can I be sure the simulated computed axis positions will be the same at the same time in real world ?
Regards
Steph

This shows how to describe your robot so that it may be simulated in Gazebo and operate better with ROS
