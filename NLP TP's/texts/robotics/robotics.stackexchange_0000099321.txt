You can try Youtube videos if the tutorials are insufficient, but working through the tutorials and suggesting improvements may be more beneficial for you and the community.

No, but googling "moveit tutorial video" turns up a 2-hour video called "MoveIt training for beginners", so I don't think they're hard to find.

A:

First, install moveit on your computer
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-noetic-moveit

Then you need to have a .urdf.xacro file for the manipulator you are trying to setup. This is the most important part, so make sure you have the correct file.
You can launch the assistant with
 roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

These are the tabs that you need to setup for the most basic setup:

Start: Create New MoveIt Configuration Package
Load your robot URDF file
Self-Collisions: Generate Collision Matrix
Virtual Joint: Create a virtual joint between your robot's base link and the world frame
Planning Groups: select KDLKinematicsPlugin and add the necessary joints to the group
Robot Poses: add desired robot poses that Moveit will have
ROS Control: setup Joint Trajectory Controller
Finally, generate the package in your workspace.

You can then test your MoveIt setup by launching the file
roslaunch [your_moveit_config_pkg] demo.launch

If you need a video describing these steps, you can watch this video that takes you through the process above:
