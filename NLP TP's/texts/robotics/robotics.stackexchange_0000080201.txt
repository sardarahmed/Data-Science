Q:

It is possible to use VLP-16-lite on ROS indigo & kinetic?

I'm planning to buy VLP-16 or VLP-16-lite. So I want to know that there is a driver for VLP-16 & VLP-16-lite on ROS.
I found that I can get the driver for VLP-16 on indigo & kinetic from here.
And I found that the site which says there is the driver for VLP-16-lite(Puck lite). But I'm wondering if the site says truth or not...
So if someone know there is a driver for VLP-16-lite, could you inform me?

Hi, I have a VLP-16 in my university lab and I'm currently using the lidar with the standard velodyne_driver ros package (and the calibration yaml file). Since the only difference should be the weight, I suppose it's going to work with the lite version too..

I think so, but I want the evidence. VLP-16 and VLP-16-LITE is very expensive. And I want to skip to develop driver for the LITE on ROS. That is why I want to confirm if there is a drive for the LITE or not.

Have you checked it? Does VLP-16 work in ROS kinetic?

Yes, I checked. VLP-16 works well in ROS Kinetic.

Does VLP-16-LITE work in ROS kinetic? Or does the driver come from the regular version?

I have not tried VLP-16 LITE on any distribution.
Now I cannot confirm which driver I used. But maybe you can use this.

A:

The VLP-16 has been tested on Indigo and Kinetic with velodyne_driver version 1.3.0, which must currently be built from source on both those repositories.
I have no reports of testing with the VLP-16-lite. If you try it, please report back whether it works or not, or edit the wiki page to add the additional model.

OK. If I test the LITE with velodyne_driver, I'll update the wiki.
