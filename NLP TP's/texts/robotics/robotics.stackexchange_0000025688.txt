Q:

Getting angle of 2 DoF joint

Is it possible to get the angle of at least one axis of a 2 DoF (in SDF type "revolute2") joint? Gazebo 1.2.5. Currently I always get zero for joint->GetAngle(0) and same for joint->GetState().GetAngle(0).
If this is the right method for it in the source code, then it seems that it is not possible, due to a bug or by design.
According to this issue, the current implementation does not support returning angle of axis other than 0, but I can't get angle of axis 0 neither.

It is indeed a bug. I've fixed it in this pull request:

The change will be released in Gazebo 1.4 (Feb. 1st)
