Q:

stageroscam, using stage, and rviz

received the folowing error using command roslaunch IGVC2013_AutoNavBasic.launch which is supposed to launch roscore, stage environment and rviz. instead only rviz opens and the following error is displayed.
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [stage_ros/stageros]: stage_ros
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/amrl/ros/stageroscam
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
e
I am new at using ros, and need to know what files might not be included in the installation, and how to add them or edit them to clear up this error.
Thanks

Try to change stage_ros by just stage. The name stage_ros is for hydro
