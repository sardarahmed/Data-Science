Q:

Problem with roslaunch after upgrading to Gazebo-1.8 & DRCSim-2.6

Hello,
Today I upgraded to Gazebo-1.8 and DRCSim-2.6 and now I encounter a problem after running
"roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch".
Gazebo fails to start properly and freezes in a gray screen then dies. This the message I get:
  [ WARN] [1369173843.179656077]: The input topic '/multisense_sl/camera/left/image_raw' is not yet advertised
  [ WARN] [1369173843.179814558]: The input topic '/multisense_sl/camera/left/camera_info' is not yet advertised
  [ WARN] [1369173843.179845859]: The input topic '/multisense_sl/camera/right/image_raw' is not yet advertised
  [ WARN] [1369173843.179875473]: The input topic '/multisense_sl/camera/right/camera_info' is not yet advertised
  [gazebo-1] process has finished cleanly

Thanks for any help,

A:

My first guess is that you're using a non-NVIDIA GPU.  There are reports that the change in drcsim 2.6 to using the GPU for laser scan generation causes gazebo to crash immediately on Intel GPUs.
There's a proposed patch that adds launch files to let you bring up simulation using the CPU-based laser.  You might try that.

I have two laptops with Intel GPUs and they both show same issue with launching atlas. I will try to use that patch. Thanks. By the way, how can downgrade to DRCSim-2.5?

All previous releases are archived.  You can download the .deb files for specific versions and install them manually with dpkg, instead of apt-get.  If you go back to drcsim 2.5.x, also go back to gazebo 1.7.x and sandia-hand 5.1.13.
