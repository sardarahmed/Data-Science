Q:

Is it possible in ROS2 to concurrently RW a bag file?

Is it possible in ROS2 to concurrently write-to and read-from the same bag file using two different processes, kind of  like using the bag file as a pipe? To my knowledge, this is not possible in ROS1, but I am curious if this is possible in ROS2.

A:

I tried this and at least with the built-in storage plugin sqlite3, it is not possible. If one tries to open a ros2 bag that is already open, one gets the following error:
[ERROR] [1642869934.723092322] [rosbag2_storage]: Could not open '/tmp/a.bag' with 'sqlite3'. Error: Failed to setup storage. Error: Could not read-only open database. SQLite error (10): disk I/O error
[ERROR] [1642869934.723146073] [rosbag2_storage]: Could not load/open plugin with storage id 'sqlite3'.
