Q:

Stewart platform as robotic wrist joint

I'm planning the design of a wrist for a humanoid robot. I would like to choose a design that is sturdy while allowing for dexterity comparable to a human wrist.
One option that was presented to me was to use a Stewart platform. This setup appears to correctly recreate all possible movements of the human hand. My immediate concern is that this platform will use a total of six actuators which will require additional power and computational requirements. I don't want to commit to this design until I am certain that there isn't a better alternative.
Is a Stewart platform a good choice for replicating the dexterousness of the human wrist? If not, what is a better solution?

A:

The "best" robot wrist in terms of human analog is probably the omni-wrist by Mark Rosheim.  It has a large range of motion, and does not have singularities or gimbal lock that plague other more conventional wrists.  However, it is fairly complicated mechanically, and thoroughly patented i believe.
The book Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics by the same author has a good discussion of human analog robotics design.
