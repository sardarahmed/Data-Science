Q:

simple proximity sensor msg

Hi,
I'm trying to connect a simple driver for a proximity sensor that only returns a Boolean answer for a preset range.
It seems that all the messages under sensor_msgs require a more complex answer like: "what is the range".
Well, I don't have that answer, I only have "yes/no".
Am I missing something?
Thanks,
Moshe

Create your own custom message with bool data  type.

Well, I guess that this is what I should do then.
I thought that maybe I'm missing something.
Thanks,
