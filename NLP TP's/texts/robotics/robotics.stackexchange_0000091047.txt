Q:

minimum memory footprint for Linux and ROS melodic (cameras, lidar)

Looking at "Jetson Nano " Quad Core ARM64 @1.47GHz with max 4GByte RAM and max 16GByte eMMC.
It comes with a Ubuntu install, so seems like a good match,
Is this memory footprint enough for an autonomus droid with cameras and Lidar ?

may be me, but wow, we're creating droids now? ;)

A:

This is plenty enough. You can run ROS with GUIs on a Raspberry Pi 3 (with 1 GByte of RAM) using the desktop environment with no problem.
With the desktop environment disabled on my Raspberry Pi 3 I have a 70 Mbyte RAM footprint.
If you are going to compile big projects (using multiple jobs with gcc/g++) make sure to create a swap file in case you fill the RAM!
