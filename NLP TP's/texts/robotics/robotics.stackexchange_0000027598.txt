Q:

Error Param.cc inf value

Hello everybody,
I am trying to spawn a robot made in URDF in Gazebo 6 but I have  the following problem.
At the beginning the robot seems ok but after a few seconds all the links seems to be placed at the origin of the world and I have the following message :

Error [Param.cc:462] Unable to set value [-inf -inf -inf 1.44116 -0.993549 1.9651] for key[pose]

Is there a problem with the way I use to set link's positions of my robot ?
I am using origin tag in my joints to place the several links of the robots :
<joint name="body_arch_fixed" type="revolute">
    <parent link="body"/>
    <child link="arch"/>
    <origin xyz="0.11105 0 1.4498" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 0 1"/>
    <limit upper="0" lower="0" effort="10" velocity="10"/>
</joint>

Thanks in advance

A:

Problem solved : PID in controller_manager had too important values
