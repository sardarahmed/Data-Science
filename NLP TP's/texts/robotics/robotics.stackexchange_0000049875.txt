Q:

android_core tutorials: no communication to roscore

I successfully installed and builder android_core. I encountered some problems but could fix them. I installed the android_tutorial_camera and android_tutorial_pubsub on the android device. Allthough both apps can run, there is no connection to the computer where the roscore runs. rosnode/rostopic list doesn't show any marks of the android device.
I tried it with 2 computers and 2 android devices with all possible combinations:

Laptop Ubuntu 10.04 with ROS electric
Desktop Ubuntu 11.10 with ROS fuerte
Samsung galaxy ace with android 2.3.3
Samsung galaxy tab 2 with android 4.0.4

None of the following URI's worked:

http: //< my_IP >:11311
http: //localhost:11311
http: //noe-laptop:11311

For the pubsub tutorial I also adapted the network adapter (link in comment).
Please help me!
Thank you, NoÃ«

A:

Just wanted to make sure that (1) your Android device can communicate roscore machines (eg. by ping, http etc)? (2) Is my_IP your roscore machine not your Android right? (3) No space b/w "http" and "//" ok?

Update) For (1), if 2 computers can communicate over IP, there's no way that a node on a computer connects to roscore that's running on another machine.
In general, it's worthwhile to check NetworkSetup, although some of the checkups there might not work for Android.
I'm not 100% sure if pinging in LAN succeeds in any situation, but at least http should go through. Easiest (not the most optimal though) way to check connection b/w 2 machines if roscore runs on Ubuntu might be running http server on it and access from Android. Can be done as:
On_Ubuntu$ sudo apt-get install apache2  

Then on Android, open http://IP_Ubuntu.

(1): no I do not manage to make them communicate (2) my_IP is from my laptop on which I run the roscore (3) I put the space there because I'm not allowed to post links already since I'm a new user of this website. Thanks already !

Update for (1):  The master is my Linux machine and the android app generates its own roscore.
I made a web server with apache2 but, although both computer and tablet are connected to the same wifi AND with a USB cable, I cannot connect to the web server from my tablet.

Do I have to setup a separate network or so?
Thank you!

Ok your issue is most likely in network, not in ROS. Make sure Android can establish IP connection to your Ubuntu. Btw running roscoreon both ends shouldn't be a problem.
