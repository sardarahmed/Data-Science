Q:

a problem with launching the MoveIt! Setup Assistant

I have followed the instructions to install the MoveIt!. Now I meet an unknown error when launching the MoveIt! Setup Assistant with roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch.
REQUIRED process [moveit_setup_assistant-1] has died!</p>

but I meet a warning when installing dependencies with rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

WARNING: Package "ompl" does not follow the version conventions. It should not contain leading zeros (unless the number is 0).

I must install correctly the ROS by debian. where can be the problem ?
Comment by Handwerker on 2015-09-07:
I install the Movelt! by the first choice. Actually I haven't followed the third step ( install the ros-hydro-moveit-full-pr2 )as I don't use it.

oh! I install the moveit! also by the second choice, now I have removed the moveit file and reinstalled the moveit! by the debian packge.but the error still happens

no SEGFAULT with the apt-get moveit. 
what's the meaning of rm -rf /path/to/catkin_ws/{build,devel}?

A:

unexpectedly I launched normally the moveit! setup assistant with the help of gvdhoorn. The total process was as follows:
According to the answer in the http://answers.ros.org/question/193137/problems-with-moveit-exit-code-11/
I guess I had also a problem with my graphic driver. 

I followed the http://askubuntu.com/questions/475972/error-couldnt-find-rgb-glx-visual-or-fbconfig-ubuntu-12-04 to install the xserver-xorg. 

sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg

sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

sudo reboot

but after rebooting I met the same error .And the touchpad also became invalid . then I tried to check the system Settings, but the settings crashed(could not be opened). 
2. I  installed the ubuntu-desktop
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
In this way the system Settings could be opened ,then I tried to launch the movit! and succeeded unexpectedly .
So I think the "Exit Code -11" is probably related to both the xserver-xorg and the ubuntu-desktop.

Good to hear that you got it to work. One approach that I'd have suggested would be to run the setup assistant in GDB, so we could get a stacktrace. That would've likely showed some issue with OpenGL initialisation and / or interaction.

thanks, this approach is also worth trying,

Hello, I tried this solution but am still getting the same error as you along with "process[moveit_setup_assistant-2]: started with pid [5132]
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/moveit_setup_assistant/moveit_setup_assistant: error while loading shared libraries: libmoveit_robot_state_rviz_plugin_core.so.0.7.3: "
