Q:

Building android_core. android_acm_serial:debug failed

Hello,
I have some problems building android_core.
I execute:
roscd android_core
./gradlew debug

And I have this:
:android_acm_serial:debug
Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
Build failed

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':android_acm_serial:debug'.
> Command 'ant' finished with (non-zero) exit value 1.

I have executed this before, but it does not work.
 roscd google
./gradlew install

Can anyone help me?
Thank you so much!

Hi!
I got the same error and I resolved it using the answer from this Question:
http://answers.ros.org/question/33104/error-building-android-core2/
Basically what you need to do is tell android to make a build.xml for the project that is missing the file.
cd into the Folder that is missing the build.xml and then
android list targets

pick one that is recent enough, for me it was target 4 (Android 4.0), so i ran the following command then:
android update project --target 4 --path .

if you build the whole android_core then you might need to do it again for each project that is missing the build.xml.
Hope that helped.
