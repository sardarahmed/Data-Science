Q:

Properly Bring Down Active Node?

I'm currently using ros::shutdown() to bring down a node that I need to kill in c++.  I'm fairly certain this is bad as the node fails ungracefully and does not seem to release all of its resources. Is there a better method?

A:

Likely what you want to do is create a custom SIGINT handler that releases whatever resources are not properly being released. This function will then get called whenever your node receives the SIGINT signal (e.g. when someone presses Ctrl+C) or when you call ros::shutdown(). A simple example is on the roscpp Initialization and Shutdown page. Also check out this question/answer.
