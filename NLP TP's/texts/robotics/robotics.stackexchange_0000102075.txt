Q:

ros2 unit testing

Hi there,
I am new to automated testing and I find it quite difficult to find a resource to write my first unit test for CPP files. Is there a tutorial with the general procedure (What commands?: just colcon test??, How should the Cmakelists.txt and the test.cpp look like?) or a minimal framework I can have a look at?
I would really appreciate the help.
Thanks a lot.

A:

You can try to base your tests on the nav2_system_tests like there, they use gtests.
E.g. planning folder has a nice example here:
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_system_tests/src/planning/test_planner_costmaps_node.cpp
