Q:

adding a message at the end of a bag file

Hello, everyone
Is it possible to add a message at the end of a bag file (the messages is of the same kind of the ones already in the bag)?
thanks for support.

A:

You can modify bag files using the rosbag code API including appending messages.

thanks. my further question is: when a bag, containing messages about more that one topic, is played, how are messages sent? are they sent simply in the order they were recorded or topic by topic?

will my added messages be sent as the last one, anyway, since i recorded it at the end?
