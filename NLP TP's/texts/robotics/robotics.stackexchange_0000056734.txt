Q:

winros: can't find tf/tfMessage type?

I have successfully built the WinROS sdk and samples using VS2010.
I have created a simple program that writes messages to a bag file.
My ultimate goal is to write tf/tfMessage type messages to the /tf topic in a bag, then to play that bag on Ubuntu for other existing nodes listening on that topic, but I don't see the tf/tfMessage type defined anywhere (thought it would be in "geometry_msgs").
I can write geometry_msgs/TransformStamped type messages which seem to have the same data, but are not compatible with the /tf topic.
Any suggestions?

Can someone confirm that tf is not ported to winros?  I just want to know that I'm not missing something.  Seems like a very important library so I thought it was, but maybe not.

Also, upon further inspection it appears that the tf/tfMessage is just an array of geometry_msgs/TransfromStamped type messages.
Can someone confirm that for me?   I'm thinking it might not be that hard to mock-up one of these in that namespace and copy the MD5 from the real one and make it work?

A:

Indeed, tf has not yet been ported to windows. We were backing off from doing that because of the move from tf to tf2 and we also didn't have a use case for it ourselves.
Be great if someone stepped in and did it. Certainly would be useful for alot of folk.

Hi there, I am now looking for tf/transform_broadcaster.h win winros and I cannot find it too in the new version (sdk-hydro-x86-vs10-0.3.1). Has it still not ported into the winros after almost 7 months?
