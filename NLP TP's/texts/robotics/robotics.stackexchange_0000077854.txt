Q:

Ask about the usage of the tilde '~'sign

Ask about the usage of the tilde '~'sign
what's the difference between :
pub = rospy.Publisher('~cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=5)

and:
pub = rospy.Publisher('cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=5)

By the way, what's the queue_size in the bracket mean?
Thank you!!

A:

The tilde is due to namespacing. a ~ puts a topic or a parameter in the nodes private namespace (i.e. /some_ns/node_ns/private_topic), whereas without the tilde, it resides in the nodes namespace (i.e. /some_ns/topic). If you add a / instead of the tilde, you'll end up in the global namespace (/topic).
Python does not have the concept of a NodeHandle as C++, but in essence this is the same as ros::NodeHandle nh("~"), ros::NodeHandle nh("") and ros::NodeHandle nh("/").
About the queue_size, there is a good explanation on the wiki.
