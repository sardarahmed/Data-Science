Q:

When should I use catkin workspace?

I dont undestand why should I use catkin worksapce. When I export a package from Moveit Setup Assistant I move it on opt/ros/indigo/share and I launch it with roslaunch di/rec/tory/demo.launch. But the name of the exported package  must be the same as the urdf package.
If  I move the exported file from Moveit Setup Assistant to home/name/catkin_ws/src and run cakin_make and launch it with roslaunch home/name/catkin_ws/src/<package_name>/launch/demo.launch it gives many errors.
The question: Am I doing the right way or should I use catkin workspace?
Upadate 1: The error was because I was not running this command source devel/setup.bash before catkin_make . Now it works. But if I import urdf file to Moveit Setup Assistant it will load only if it is on opt/ros/indigo/share if i load the urdf file from local work-space the urdf package with meshes is not found.
The question 2: What should I install to local work-space catkin_ws/src (if this is the right path)?
Update 2: catkin_make fails when I install rviz_visual_tools and  moveit_tutorials on catkin_ws/src

A:

Until you are more comfortable with ROS and Catkin, I'd always create a Catkin workspace in your home directory and do all your development in/from there.
Never (*) move packages to /opt/ros/$distro: it's certainly possible to store whatever you want there, but it's likely that you'll do it incorrectly, leading to all sorts of weird and hard to debug problems. Besides: you must have had to either use sudo .. to get the files there, or have run the Setup Assistant as root. It's typically a red flag if you ever need super user rights to do anything in ROS (it's almost a second never (*)).
Treat /opt/ros/$distro as a no-go area, create a workspace and put your own packages in that workspace. Know btw that you'll only have to source your own devel/setup.bash: no need to source the one in /opt/ros/$distro every time as well (do it once, before you catkin_make / catkin build your workspace).

If  I [..] run cakin_make and launch [..] roslaunch home/name/catkin_ws/src/<package_name>/launch/demo.launch it gives many errors.

And another tip: please include examples of any errors you get when you ask us questions. We can't know what is going wrong for you, and this makes it very hard for us to help you.
*) well, 'never'. But for now, no, never.

Look on my update please

I don't have time to answer everything right now, but your missing packages are caused by the fact that you didn't install all prerequisites.
Run a rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths /home/student/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src, then try building again.
