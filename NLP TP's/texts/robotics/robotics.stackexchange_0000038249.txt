Q:

rosserial arduino

It seems like I can interface a ROS runtime graph with an arduino using rosserial. But I am not sure which Arduino to get. I wouldn't want to get an arduino that rosserial couldn't support... I am mostly worried about the memory requirements. Because running rosserial could be memory intensive in certain cases.
So my question is..should I go with the cheapest available arduino or should I go with the one that has the most RAM? My ultimate goal is to interface ROS with an arduino so that I can send and recieve signals or message between a ROS runtime graph and the arduino..

A:

It depends on how much you want to do.
The UNO and Nano do work with rosserial and they are quite cheap.
You should get the versions with the 328 ship.

Is there  a particular reason that you recommend the arduino's with the 328 chip?

The 168 have less memory. Usually all new ones have the 328.

thanks for the clarification. I'll go with the UNO R3 > )
