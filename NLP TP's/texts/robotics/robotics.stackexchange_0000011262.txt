Q:

Parallel axis theorem to determine the moment of inertia

I need to use the parallel axis theorem to determine the moment of inertia of each robotic arm link referred to the joints of the 3 DOF manipulator. The moments of each link's centre of mass are:

The link joints are located according to the following coordinates from each link's centre of mass and the link masses are specified as:

I know that solve Izz, Iyy and Ixx to use the following equations:
Ixx = Ixx + m(ry^2 + rz^2)
Izz = Izz + m(rx^2 + ry^2)
Iyy = Iyy + m(rx^2 + rz^2)
But I'm not sure how to solve this particular problem, I was thinking since y1 and z1 both equal 0, to solve the question for that link I need to solve I1yy and I1zz is that right?

A:

If the distance between the axes is zero, then there is no change in the inertia for that specific axis. 
You can verify your calculations with a CAD software. Most of them (Solid Works, Inventor, Catia, etc.) can calculate the intertia of solid bodies in any defined reference frame (coordiante system).
