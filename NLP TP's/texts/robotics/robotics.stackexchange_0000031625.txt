Are you asking how to get the transformation matrix of the camera that rviz is using to view from a specific location? Also I think you have a typo in your title. I think you meant to have a "get the" before "orientation", and a '?'

A:

Rviz does not expose the pose of the viewpoint camera.  If you're interested in this feature, you can file a feature request in trac. You find a link on the bottom of the wiki http://www.ros.org/wiki/visualization
