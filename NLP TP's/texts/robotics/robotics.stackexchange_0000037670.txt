Q:

How to use arm_kinematics package?

As i am new to ROS platform i need some guidance to use arm_kinematics package for solving FK and IK for basic 5 DOF. In order to understand this package i followed the pr2_kinematics tutorials. But i am getting message while executing the command "rosrun pr2_arm_navigation_tutorials get_fk"
waitForService: Service [/pr2_right_arm_kinematics/get_fk_solver_info] has not been advertised, waiting...
after this there nothing is displaying.Previous to this i got error message
cannot launch node of type [pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware/pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware]: Cannot locate node of type [pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware] in package [pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware]
but pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware.cpp is available in pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware package and it has been added in CmakeList.txt file and also this package path is available in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable.I confirmed it by using rospack find command.
Please help me to solve this.
Regards,
Rajeswari

You might have already done this, but have you made the pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware a dependence in the manifest of your package and used rosmake to build the pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware binary?
Comment by Rajeswari on 2012-02-16:
yes i have added pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware as a dependence in the manifest.xml file...

A:

Cannot locate node of type [foo] ... means it can't find the "foo" binary. Are you sure you compiled this package ? Is the foo binary where is it supposed to be ? (in /pr2_arm_kinematics_constraint_aware/bin)
