Q:

Robot_pose_ekf with wheelodometry and IMU

Hello
I would like to use the robot_pose_ekf package fusing the IMU sensor data and the odometry coming from encoders. Is there any documentation or tutorials of settings launch parameters and some nodes examples. Some code examples ?Any helps would be good.
Thanks

A:

The following link has an example launch file configuration:

www.ros.org/wiki/robot_pose_ekf

The navigation tutorials are a great place to start:

www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials

This tutorial describes how to publish odometry information:

But why I need to publish the odometry?? I need to subscribe to odom (nav_msgs/Odometry) . Thats the robot_pose_ekf subscribed topic.

If you have odometry information being published by your robot as a nav_msgs::Odometry, then you do not have to publish it.The robot_pose_ekf node reads odometry messages published as "odom" topic.

Yes. I already have odometry information published by my robot as nav_msgs::Odometry,
