Q:

Running usb_cam across VNC and getting Cannot identify '/dev/video0'

Hello guys, I was running a docker container that contains the normal ros packages and usb_cam. I visualized the ubuntu interface through a VNC (localhost:5900) and tried roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch in the VNC viewer. However, I got:
[ERROR] [1559585420.922861365]: Cannot identify '/dev/video0': 2, No such file or directory

When I tried ls -ltrh /dev/video*, I got ls: cannot access '/dev/video*': No such file or directory.
Everything works when I tried the aboves on my local computer, are there any additional steps I need to make so I can use my webcam in a docker image?

yes: mount the device file into your Docker container (using -v or --volume), similar to how you would do that with other files and directories.
This is not really a ROS issue btw: I would suggest you try to search for how to make Linux device files available to/in Docker containers.
