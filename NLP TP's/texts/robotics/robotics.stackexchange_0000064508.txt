Q:

rosmake arbotix built 0 packages

I'm setting up a robot arm with my turtlebot, and I am following this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/mini_max_defs/Tutorials/Wiring%20Mini%20Maxwell
When I get to the section where I need to use rosmake on the stack, none of the packages build. Here is what the console spews when I use rosmake:
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

Any help is appreciated, thanks.

A:

It looks like that tutorial is pretty outdated; it was written for the old build system (rosbuild) and last updated in 2011...
The arbotix stack has since been migrated to catkin, and is released and available through the package manager.
If you're on Ubuntu and you're using Indigo, you can install it with:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-arbotix

I've updated the stack documentation and remove the reference to rosmake in the tutorial
