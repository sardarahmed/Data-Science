Q:

An alternative package of opende for indigo

Dear all
I have a ros-project which works nicely for all the previous distributions of ROS. I updated my ros and I've found out that opende is not supported anymore. Do you have any suggestions?
Best

A:

ODE is available from Ubuntu as a system package. We've transitioned to using that from upstream. You should be able to do the same. You can use the rosdep key 'opende' to reference it.
