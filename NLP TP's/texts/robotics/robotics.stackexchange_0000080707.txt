Q:

Why ros-kinetic-desktop package depends on gazebo?

As ros-kinetic-desktop depends on ros-kinetic-urdf-tutorial, and ros-kinetic-urdf-tutorial depends on ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros, installing ros-kinetic-desktop installs gazebo.
I think that something is wrong with that, because gazebo should be installed with ros-kinetic-desktop-full (and its dependency ros-kinetic-simulators).
Was this bug/feature introduced intentionally?

A:

This was a 'mistake' and has been addressed.
See ros-infrastructure/rep#130 and the other linked tickets (such as ros/metapackages#13).
