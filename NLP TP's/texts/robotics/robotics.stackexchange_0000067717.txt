Q:

Saving geotiff map in Hector_slam

Hello,
I am new to ROS. I have been trying to save my lidar data as a geotiff map using Hector _Slam . The tutorial says to run :
rostopic pub syscommand std_msgs/String "savegeotiff"

Running this command does not show any error. The tutorial says that it will then automatically save the map to  the 'hector_slam/hector_geotiff/maps' folder . However I find no hector_geotiff folder within the Hector_SLAM folder. I was wondering if I need to create some listener node for this purpose. Please guide as I am a beginner in ROS.

Please check logs of hector_geotiff node. Also, could you please share your output for rostopic list.

A:

You will need to run this command to save the map either while the mapping process is ongoing (then you will get a partial map) or once you are satisfied by the produced map as shown by RVIZ (then you will get a full map).
Note that hector_slam should be active for hector_map_server to be able to export the generated map.
Please refer to this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam/Tutorials/MappingUsingLoggedData for detailed steps.
hector_slam package has hector_geotiff with a folder called "maps".
Download hector_slam full version from: https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam.
catkin_make it and run:
roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch

with
rosbag play Team_Hector_MappingBox_RoboCup_2011_Rescue_Arena.bag  --clock

as described in the mentioned tutorial, then save the map using:
rostopic pub syscommand std_msgs/String "savegeotiff"
