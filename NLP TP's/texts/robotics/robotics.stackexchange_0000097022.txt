Q:

dynamic_reconfigure: Why don't many ROS Navigation Plugins have add_dependencies() for gencfg in CMakeLists.txt

I was following this tutorial to get dynamic_reconfigure to work on my own nav_stack plugin.
However, I notice that in ros navigation stack plugins, for example the global planners, in theirCMakeLists.txt, they do not declare
add_dependencies(plugin_name ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${PROJECT_NAME}_gencfg)

Is there a reason why?
Thanks, Rico

That target is included in ${planner_EXPORTED_TARGETS}, so there is no need to list it separately.

Nice! Can I ask is ${PROJECT_NAME}_gencfg target automatically included in ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS}? If not, where is it included? Thanks,Rico

${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS} does indeed contain the _gencfg target.

Awesome, Thanks!
