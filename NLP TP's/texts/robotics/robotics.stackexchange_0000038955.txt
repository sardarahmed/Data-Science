Q:

hector_localization

Hi,
if anyone could help i'd be grateful.
I chose that topic, but if anyone knows about any other package/stack that could solve my problem, shoot!. :D
I am looking for a package that estimates a robot's position over time, using only the information of an IMU.(if there is one...)
I probably found one(hector_localization) that can solve my problem, however
I cant make it work. It compiled without any problem, I changed the subscribed topic to have the same name as the one published by my lse_xsens. I can get the orientations but not the position. I dont know if it needs the information of gps or any other sensor to work.
I found no information explaining how to use, so I'd appreciate any help I can get.
Thanks.

Does only IMU mean: no laser or similar?
Comment by PedroS. on 2012-03-24:
yes I only have the information that comes from the imu. I know it's not the best way to do things but that's what i got.

Hi. I would like to use hector_localization too, but I can make it run. It compiles but I dont know how to run and what parameters it need. Any help?

If you have a new question open one instead of commenting on other question. You will also need to describe your actual problem.

A:

In the case of IMU only hector_localization and in fact all localization algorithms aren't applicable. The only thing you can do is integrate information from the IMU depending on what kind of information you get.
For the xsens that means integrating the xyz accelerations and gyros. Expect high drift, very quickly, though.
