Q:

Saving jpeg depth image from /camera/depth/image on Kinect

Hello. When I try right clicking the image window, from image:=/camera/depth/image,
to save the image on jpeg format I get on my folder a totally black picture. I know it works on RGB images and on image:=/camera/depth/image_rect_raw.
So any idea to get the image on jpeg format from image:=/camera/depth/image cuz it's way better than image:=/camera/depth/image_rect_raw.

A:

Neither of those is an image in the JPEG sense. They are depth images.
If you want the RGB camera image, use one of these topics (or the rectified versions):

camera/rgb/image_mono
camera/rgb/image_color

See REP-0118 for details.
