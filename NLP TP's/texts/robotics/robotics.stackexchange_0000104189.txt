Q:

Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros2 (404 not found)

I am trying to upgrade my packages but when I run apt upgrade I am getting the following error:
E: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-humble-rviz2/ros-humble-rviz2_11.2.7-1jammy.20230814.171234_amd64.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 2605:bc80:3010::134 80]

Did the gpg keys expired or got changed? I checked the github repo and the last change was 2 years ago, so I am not sure what is happening.
Any ideas?
BTW: I am using ubuntu 22.04 + ROS Humble

Solution
I had to manually delete the apt cache. I tried running apt clean but it didn't work.
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/*

A:

I think you just need to run a "sudo apt update" to get the latest versions of available Debians.
The file name you referenced does not currently exist on the server - but a version with the later build date code of 20230822 does exist - so I think your apt cache is out of date.
