Q:

Documenting parameters and nodes

Is there any standard way to generate documentation for nodes and parameters in a ros wiki like form?
I tried with rosdoc but I'm getting only the doxygen documentation.

Actually a little step has been made with http://ros.org/wiki/rosdoc_lite.. still not enough..

A:

Unfortunately, there's no automatic way of doing this at the moment.
That being said, it'd be great to have a standard (like XML or YAML-based) way of documenting a node's ROS interface. Then a file like that could be parsed by the wiki.

Probably some documentation should be easy to generate.. the list of nodes can be taken from the CMakeLists.txt file, and for simple nodes also the list of topics can be extracted with some greps... harder if the topic subscription/publication is done not in the main function..
