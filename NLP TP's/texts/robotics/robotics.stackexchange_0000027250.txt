Q:

Adding obstacles programmatically to Gazebo

I want to add a number of random obstacles (boxes in particular) to Gazebo programmatically. In particular, given n boxes to add, I'd like to add a box of random dimensions to a random pose (constrained to, say, lie on the ground plane). What is the easiest way to do this?
Thanks!

Hi,
take a look at this tutorial, it shows you how to add models to the world from a world plugin.
Cheers,
Andrei
