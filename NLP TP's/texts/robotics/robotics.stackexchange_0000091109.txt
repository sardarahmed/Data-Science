Q:

Ros 2 import tf2 Python

Hello,
I started having a look at Ros 2 (crystal) two weeks ago and really had a hard time creating a package that produces some executables.
As I managed to do that I tried to migrate some old code to Ros 2 code. It was just a tiny project which moved a frame in a circel around the world-frame's center in rviz. To do that I used the TransformBroadcaster imported from tf. I saw that there is now tf2 in my rosdistro/share, so I tried to import that with import tf2, but this threw a
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tf2'

The weird thing is, I can import TFMessage from tf2_msgs and publish TFMessages to tf 'by hand'.
This really feels like  I overlooked something trivial but as I didn't find anything so far I wanted to ask here.

A:

It appears that the package tf2_py is not ported to ROS 2 yet (it doesn't appear here).
There seem to be ongoing work for porting it https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/99
HTH,
