Q:

Should the therotical parameters match the physical setup constraints when modeling a robot?

I'm working on modeling and simulation of robotic arm, after I obtained the mathematical model of the robot, I used that to implement some control techniques, to control the motion of the robot. The dimensions and masses of each links are taken from available kit, basically, it's RA02 robot with servo at each joint. After the modeling, different parameters, can be plotted: like the joint angles\speeds\torques ... etc. The point now is that, the value obtained for the joint toque is much more higher that the torque limit of the servo, does it mean my design\modeling is not realizable? Is it necessarily to get close (torque)  value for servo's torque? 
Any suggestion?

A:

If your computed torques are out of the range for your robot, then you are no longer modelling your robot but a different one. You can ignore the torque limits as good as the joint angle limits of your robot (i.e. not at all). 
If the required torque is to high, your robot will either be much slower (if you are lucky) or won't be able to reach its goal positions (e.g. if it's just not able to overcome gravity).
