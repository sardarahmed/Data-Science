Q:

To understand the concept of Origin field from map_server

Hello.
I'm trying to run some tutorial which have a ROS Navigation Stack sample.
On doing, I couldn't understand the concept of ORIGIN field from yaml which the map_server create after mapping.
Here is a description by ROS wiki.

origin : The 2-D pose of the lower-left pixel in the map, as (x, y, yaw), with yaw as counterclockwise rotation (yaw=0 means no rotation). Many parts of the system currently ignore yaw.

What this, "the lower-left pixel in the map", mean??

A:

The red arrow in the image shows the position of the lower-left pixel. Assign a coordinate to that pixel using origin field. The coordinates of other pixels are calculated relative to the value that you had assigned to lower-left pixel.
