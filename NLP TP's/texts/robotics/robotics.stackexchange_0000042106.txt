Q:

Can the camera position be specified in an SDF file?

I am converting a Gazebo 0.x world file into Gazebo 1.x SDF format. In the original file, I was able to specify the initial camera position like this:
<rendering:gui>
  <frames>
    <row height="100%">
      <camera width="100%">
        <xyz>85.52 3.6 1.92</xyz>
        <rpy>0 23.8 69.9</rpy>
      </camera>
    </row>
  </frames>
</rendering:gui>

Does SDF provide similar functionality? I can't find any in the SDF documentation.

A:

I looked through the Gazebo 1.0.2 source files, and found that the initial camera pose can be specified like this:
<gui>
  <camera name="user_camera">
    <origin pose="85.52 3.6 1.92 0 0.4154 1.22"/>
  </camera>
</gui>
