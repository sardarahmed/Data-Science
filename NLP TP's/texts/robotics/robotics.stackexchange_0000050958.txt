Q:

rviz couldn't find executable

I download rviz and I did rosmake rviz  but it gave me following error when I try rosrun rviz rviz
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rviz below /home/mayara/groovy_workspace/sandbox/rviz
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/mayara/groovy_workspace/sandbox/rviz
[rosrun]   /home/mayara/groovy_workspace/sandbox/rviz/src/rviz
[rosrun]   /home/mayara/groovy_workspace/sandbox/rviz/src/python_bindings/rviz

Any idea ? I'm using ROS Groovy

A:

In groovy, rviz uses catkin instead of rosmake, like any decent package does. Follow these steps to build it:
cd /home/mayara/groovy_workspace/sandbox/rviz
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun rviz rviz

The rviz binary will be /home/mayara/groovy_workspace/sandbox/rviz/devel/lib/rviz/rviz

For future readers: there is nothing "indecent" about using rosbuild. In some cases, there is no other option. In others, converting may not make sense yet.
