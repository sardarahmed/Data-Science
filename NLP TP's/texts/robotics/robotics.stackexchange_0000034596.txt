Q:

Renaming node (or nodelet) in roslaunch for top

I have some pretty nodelet heavy roslaunch files.
I'd like their 'command' in top to be more descriptive than just 'nodelet'.
Is there a way to rename the execution command so that linux will report its CPU usage with a custom name?  It can get pretty bad when there's 12+ nodelets.  :)

I do have a workaround with 'htop'  as it displays the entire command including launch args, but that's clunkier and not installed by default.

Although, it's not really relevant to my problem, here's an example launch file.  The real issue is that top reports the executable name as compiled, but for nodelets, it's always 'nodelet'.

I've edited to include an example launch file that contains many nodelets.

Could you post an example launch file?

A:

Try "top -c". I think that will at least replace htop.
