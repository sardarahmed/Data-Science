Q:

include ROS into external CMake project (OpentTLD)

Hi,
I want to extend the OpenTLD project to use it with ros. I'm using the C++ port from Georg Nebehay ( https://github.com/gnebehay/OpenTLD ).
This project is build with cmake and multiple custom CmakeLists.txt files.
Unfortunately I am not sure how I have to change my own packages CMakeLists.txt to build OpenTLD with the need cmake settings?
Any help would be appreciated.
Kind regards,
Markus

Did you ever get this working?

Yes, but i only have it running with a hardcoded boundary box. If you want i will upload it to github so you can use and modify it.

Thank you for your answer.
In the end i followed another way.
I adapted the CMakeLists.txt to reflect to custom CMakeLists.txt files from the OpenTLD package.
Before I didn't know you could do it this way. This site helped me a lot.
