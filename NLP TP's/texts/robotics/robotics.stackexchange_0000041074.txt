Q:

Installation problems with Fuerte and rosjava

Hello everyone,
I'm trying to install rosjava for use with fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04
I followed the installation instructions substituting fuerte for electric.
Everything seems to be working fine until I run the rosws update command.
I'm rather new to linux so I'm not sure what I should be doing to fix this.
Any help would be appreciated.
~/ros_workspace$ rosws update
