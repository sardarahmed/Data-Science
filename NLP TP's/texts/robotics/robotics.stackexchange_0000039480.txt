Q:

How to get opencv on electric precise (ubuntu 12.04)?

Does anyone know how I can get vision_opencv installed on electric/precise?  Thanks.
I'm running Ubuntu Precise (12.04) and ROS electric, and cannot seem to install opencv2.3 aka vision_opencv.  "rosdep install vision_opencv" fails due to there not being a "precise" build of it available, e.g.  "No installers found for rosdep [opencv2.3], OS version [precise]..."
I'm also unable to build OpenCV-2.3.1 separately;  a bunch of warnings, then:
make[2]: *** [modules/highgui/CMakeFiles/opencv_highgui.dir/src/cap_ffmpeg.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [modules/highgui/CMakeFiles/opencv_highgui.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
Steve.

A:

ROS Electric does not support Ubuntu Precise.  See 1.  You will have to wait until ROS Fuerte support for Precise is added (in progress) if you wish to have a binary install and the relevant compatibility fixes.
Otherwise, you will to continue down the manual source build that you've been doing and deal with the compatibility issues that crop up.
