Q:

Why my depth map is so bad?

Hello,
I don't know if it's normal to obtain this kind of depth map ? Can you tell me ?
What I did is the following: i have dataset with left and right image. Thank to stereo_image_proc, I obtained the pointCloud2 and disparity image. (I can't know if my disparity image is valid because image_view crash and i can't see with rqt_image_view)
Then I transformed the Disparity Image to Depth Map thank to this node https://github.com/skohlbr/disparity_image_proc
But I obtain a very weird result: http://hpics.li/74b5c6f
Do you know why ? And especially how i can solve this problem ?
Many thank,

A:

I don't see what is weird about the result, closer points appear darker, while those further away are brighter, which is expected for depth images. Looks more like a visualization issue with image_view to me, as it does not set the min/max depth for coloring as you might would like. Not sure if there are command line options for doing so.
