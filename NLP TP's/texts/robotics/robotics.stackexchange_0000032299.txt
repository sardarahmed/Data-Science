Q:

ros cross-compile for gumstix?

does anyone know of instructions on how to setup cross-compilation of ros packages for gumstix (or any ARM processor). I only see instructions on how to compile ROS itself. I am more interested in packages I can compile on a host computer (faster), so then I can just move the binary file into the gumstix and run it!
Note:both the host and the gumstix are running ubuntu, gumstix is already running gumros.
Thank you!
