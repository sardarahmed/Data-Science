Q:

universal_robot package for ROS Kinetic

Currently I am working on some movement planning projects with UR3, and one of the ideas is to use Raspberry Pi 3 model B as a computing center for robot's motion planning. The issue is that Ubuntu development team officially supports only Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial version for RPi3, and even Ubunty Trusty image for Raspberry Pi 2 is no longer maintained.
As we tested, there is no problem to install Ubuntu Xenial with Kinetic on RPi3, but the problem is that officially universal_robot driver is not compatible with Kinetic, so it won't work.

Is there plans to develop ROS Kinetic version for driver, with compatibility with moveit planner?

Maybe there are other solutions for computing boards with Trusty + Indigo, do you know some?

Thanks in advance.

A:

Edit: ur_modern_driver has Kinetic support and is now hosted at ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver. Be sure to use the kinetic-devel branch.

Original answer:
I prefer the ur_modern_driver over ur_driver (in universal_robot).  Github page here.
It doesn't have official Kinetic support yet either but there is a user fork available that should work as discussed in issue 58.  I would hope/expect that a Kinetic branch will be added soon as there is significant demand.

I agree about ur_modern_driver being the preferred package, but just to clarify: only for the driver. universal_robot still provides the rest of the packages (robot support, moveit, etc).

And because of that support, it is not that clear when we are talking about Kinetic compatibility. I am using ur_modern_driver too, but it also has dependencies with universal_robot and that package just a replacer for old ur_driver
