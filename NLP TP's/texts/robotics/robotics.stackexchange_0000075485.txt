Q:

ROS Serial Exception Missing File

Hello all,
I have a node running in ROS Indigo which makes use of the serial library. I've used it on other machines in the past without any issues. My current system is an ODroid XU4.
When I go to run the node however I get the following error:
odroid@odroid:~/Control_Code$ rosrun imu imu_node 
[ INFO] [1469661666.648402551]: running...
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'serial::IOException'
  what():  IO Exception (2): No such file or directory, file /tmp/binarydeb/ros-indigo-serial-1.2.1/src/impl/unix.cc, line 151.
Aborted

Looking in synaptic I have
ros-indigo-serial
ros-indigo-serial-utils

With the following includes:
#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "serial/serial.h"

#include "ros/time.h"

#include "std_msgs/String.h"

#include <string>

#include <iostream>

#include <vector>

#include <ios>

#include <stdint.h>

I have no idea where this error is coming from. Has anyone seen this before? What other troubleshooting steps can I take?
Thanks!

A:

The serial port you are trying to open does not exist. This is a runtime error, so it doesn't have anything to do with the files you are including at compile time (they're all there otherwise it wouldn't compile).

That was it, I dug around more and found that the path hadn't been updated.
Thanks!

New to ROS here- what did you do to update your path?

Look for your device with ls /dev. If none of the entries match the one you are calling when running your nodes, this error message will appear.
