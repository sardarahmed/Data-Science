Q:

Which is a good and cheap 3D LIDAR or other options?

Our team is planning to go for European Rover Challenge (ERC) 2018 for which we are designing an Autonomous rover. In order to implement SLAM, we need a way of mapping (with a range of atleast 2-4 meters) for which we considered using a LIDAR or a stereo cam. Could anyone suggest a good, cheap and accurate enough LIDAR, Stereo cam or some other option by which we could achieve this?

A:

There are now some sub and around ~1000USD 3D Lidars available. I wanted to provide an answer for future reference if anyone else comes looking for "cheap" Lidars.

LeddarTech M16 ~500 USD on Ebay

Range: 110 m
FOV: 19x3.0 degrees (up to 8.0 degrees depending on model, with 30 m range at that FoV)
Refresh rate: 6.25 Hz

BeneWake CE30 ~1000 - 1500USD on ebay

Range: 30 m
FoV: 60x4 degrees (up to 132x9 for 4 m range)
Refresh rate: 30Hz

Livox Mid40/Mid-100 ~600 - 1500USD

Range: 90m
FoV: 38.4 circular (Mid-40 has a 38.4 circular pattern FoV, so its a bit special, but it can technically be used as a 3D lidar, however the pointcloud pattern is a bit different, the Mid-100 is 3 mid-40 providing up to 100 degree FoV)

A really good review on the Mid-40 can be found here. It also explains some of the challenges with the circular patterns, as some SLAM algorithms and fusing algorithms might needs to be adapted to this new pattern, thus not working out of the box.
