Q:

"make eclipse-project" - problem

Hello to all,
i followed this tutorial.
At this Step:

Open a terminal, roscd into the folder
of your package, and execute:
make eclipse-project
You will now find two Eclipse files in
your package. It is not recommended to
add them to the repository, as they
contain absolute links and will be
different for different users checking
out your software.

no ecplise files are generated in my package.
Following text is shown by the terminal:
faps@UbuntuBioMech:~/ros_workspace/test$ make eclipse-project 
mv Makefile Makefile.ros if ! (cmake -G"Eclipse
CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -Wno-dev . &&
rm Makefile && rm CMakeCache.txt && rm
-rf CMakeFiles); then mv Makefile.ros Makefile && echo "**ERROR building
Eclipse project!**" && false; fi

Any Ideas what is going wrong? Many Thanks in advance,

executing  ls .project, the terminal shows:
faps@UbuntuBioMech:~/ros_workspace/test$ ls .project 
.project

Eclipse cant find any project-files in the directionary.

A:

It seems that the project file is being generated correctly.
Now you only need to import it to your project into Eclipse. For that you should start eclipse from a terminal where the ROS-related environment variables are defined (they should be if you added the line source /opt/ros/ROS_VERSION/setup.bash to your .bashrc file).
To make it easier I have this launcher in $HOME/Desktop/eclipse.desktop:
[Desktop Entry]
Exec=bash -i -c "PATH_TO_ECLIPSE/eclipse"
Icon=PATH_TO_ECLIPSE/icon.xpm
Type=Application
Terminal=false
StartupNotify=true
Name=Eclipse
GenericName=Integrated Development Environment
MimeType=text/x-c++src;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-xsrc;
Categories=Eclipse;Development; IDE;
InitialPreference=9

Once Eclipse is running go to File->Import...
Select "Existing Projects into Workspace" on the dialog and click "Next"
Choose "Select root directory" and click the button "Browse...". Now navigate until you find the folder where your ROS project is stored and select it. (You will not be able to see the .project file on the list, but that is fine, just hit the "OK" button.)
Now the project name will appear on the Projects list. Click the "Finish" button and you are done!
I hope this helps.
