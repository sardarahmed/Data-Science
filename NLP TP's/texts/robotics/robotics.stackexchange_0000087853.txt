Q:

How do I install Kinetic from a DVD?

I need to install Kinetic Kame on a system with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, but the catch is the only way I can put something on the system is via DVD (no Internet or USB drives).
So my question is, is there a way that I can neatly pack what I need onto a DVD for installation? I have read on Ubuntu's site that I can use Keryx, Synaptic (which I think needs a USB device), or apt-offline to install packages on non-networked computers.
Does anyone have any experience installing ROS using one of these options? Is one more preferable than the other for ROS, especially for a DVD installation? I'm open to hearing other methods as well.
