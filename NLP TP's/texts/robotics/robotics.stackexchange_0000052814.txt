Q:

hector-mapping Lookup would require extrapolation into the future

Hi,
i try to run hector-slam on the asctec pelican. But when i launch hector-mapping i get the following error:
[ERROR] [1230818054.341736259]: Transform failed during publishing of map_odom transform: Lookup would require extrapolation into the future.  Requested time 1230818053.694549500 but the latest data is at time 1230818053.195532500, when looking up transform from frame [/base_link] to frame [/nav]

If i am right, that error means that my tf data is to old so it is not used or ?
I have tried to set the publish rate of tf higher (up to 1000Hz), but the error keeps. I also have make sure that i do not use the sim time.

Hi, did you solve the problem? I've got the same problem here which prohibits me from keep going. Couldn't find any related support .Am I missing anything?

A:

Hi, I faced this problem, too. And I solved this problem through this method.
In the hectormapping launch file, I added the line below:
Then everything is OK. I am under the environment: ROS Hydro+turtlebot2
So I guess the problem is caused by some parameters of the mobe_base.launch.xml
