Q:

How to define a cost function for the 'general state cost integral' optimization objective of OMPL through MoveIt?

Hi, I'm relatively new to OMPL and MoveIt, but I'm fairly certain that I understand the capabilities of OMPL and that there are no tutorials for this. Maybe I'm just missing something. I'm hoping someone might have an idea.
I want to use the general state cost integral optimization objective to plan movements for a UR5 robot arm. I know how to tell MoveIt to use this method (in ompl_planning.yaml), but I don't know where I need to define the cost function. Is it even possible at the moment?
Thank you for your time!

I don't think this is supported in MoveIt right now, but let's wait on some other answers.

This has been asked and basically answered before on the moveit mailing list (but thanks for asking here!):
