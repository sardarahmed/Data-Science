Q:

How to fix a Jenkins error?

Hello everyone,
the binary builds of my package in Jenkins failed with a dependency error.
I fixed the error in my CMakeLists.txt file and updated the Github repo accordingly.
However the last two builds still failed with the same error.
I was assuming that Jenkins downloads the files from Github every time it tries to build?
Do I have to do anything else in order to make Jenkins build from the updated repo?
Thanks!

yes: you have to do a Bloom release of the fixed version. Jenkins (the buildfarm really) will only build released versions of your packages. It does not make a clone of HEAD.

To catch these kind of things before you push a new release, you can do a prerelease test run, see wiki/bloom/Tutorials/PrereleaseTest.
