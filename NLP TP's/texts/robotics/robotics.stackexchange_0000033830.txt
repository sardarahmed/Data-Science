Q:

New stack with the same name as an older stack

I recently submitted a new ROS repository to be indexed and have a stack (named rovio) that conflicts with an out-of-date stack on ROS. The old stack was changed from rovio to rovio-eol as seen on this wiki page: http://www.ros.org/wiki/iheart-ros-pkg After being indexed, our repository page does not list the rovio stack (because of the naming conflict I assume since http://www.ros.org/wiki/rovio still exists even though it's repository does not). Our repository page is listed at http://www.ros.org/wiki/wpi-rail-ros-pkg How can we get the current rovio stack to be indexed properly so we can begin documentation?

No problem, as soon as your documentation is updated, please accept an answer to your questions, so we'll know that you are good to go.

My apologies. I had noticed a partial update after a few hours but did not see all of the changes and thus asked a new question. I will be sure to keep comments within the same thread in the future!

Please do not ask the same question multiple ways twice.  This is essentially the same as question 1951 that you asked.

A:

I'm not sure this is the actual answer, but judging from this question: I'm not sure this is the actual answer, but judging from: http://answers.ros.org/question/1951/indexer-schedule
There may have been some recent issues with the indexer, but @mwise_wg seems to have resolved them.  It may take a bit of time for that to propagate.

The rosdoc build is still inflight.
