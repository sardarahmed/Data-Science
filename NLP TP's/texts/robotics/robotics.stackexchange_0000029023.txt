Q:

Is it possible to change the entire background of Gazebo white or transparent?

Hello friends, I am trying to get some nice screenshots of my model, but I didn't want them to have a background.  It would really make my paper pop if I could get the entire background of the empty Gazebo world I am using to be white instead of that standard gray.
I am sure this has been asked but I am struggling to find exactly what I am looking for....any help is greatly appreciated.

A:

Add this description to your world file.
<scene>
  <ambient>1 1 1 1</ambient>
  <background>1 1 1 1</background>
  <shadows>0</shadows>
</scene>

For the full specification, see here.
You could optionally try to play with the sun (see here).

Thanks for this! I got the background to go white, now I just need to get the "working area" (grid area) to also be white. It is currently gray...
EDIT: I think I have gotten something that is more then appropriate for my application.  Thanks a bunch for the help @nlamprian
