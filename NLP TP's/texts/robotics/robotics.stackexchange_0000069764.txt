Q:

get std_msgs::Header associated with a frame from image_transport?

Is there a way to get the std::msgs::Header associated with an image sent over image_transport?  I need some unique key from my images to stick in the header of mesages derived from them to maintain the association.

A:

The images are passed as sensor_msgs::Image messages. You can definitely access the contents of the header in those messages. The header contains seq, stamp and frame_id. If for example you have a callback imageCb, then you can follow the code snippet to access the contents of the header.
   void imageCb(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& msg){  
          std::cout << msg->header.seq <<  std::endl;
          std::cout << msg->header.stamp <<  std::endl;
          std::cout << msg->header.frame_id <<  std::endl;
   }

Is this what you want?
