Q:

[rosparam] do not overwrite an existing param or default value

Hi all,
I'm looking for a way to specify a DEFAULT value for /some/parameter on the parameter server in a XML launch file.
In other terms if it's already there I don't want to overwrite the previous value.
Also is it possible to test any other variable than a bool?
I would like to do something like:
  <!-- THIS DOES NOT WORK -->
  <node if="$(arg method)==nearest" name="point_provider" pkg="point_providers" type="simple_publisher.py" />
  <node if="$(arg method)==regression" name="point_provider" pkg="regression_models" type="publisher.py" />

Is there any way to achieve this?
Also a complete control structure if/elif/else would be nice.
Thanks

A:

Avoiding parameter override seems to be not possible but in #q173575 some workarounds are suggested.
