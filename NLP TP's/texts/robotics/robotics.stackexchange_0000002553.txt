Q:

Capacitive touch input robot to remote access iPad

I'd like to buy a capacitive touch input robot in order to remote access my iPad but I'm having trouble describing a correct kind of robot. 
I would like to keep lag down to an additional 60ms so that it is still a high quality interface. 
I would like to have a robotic arm equipped with a capacitive pen that moves to places on the ipad screen based on the mouse or I'd like a array of capacitive pens that emulate the touch of a user. 
I guess I'd use Squires software reflect and the mirror function but I'm open to using an SHD camera with the robotic arm and a pixel sensor array with the array of capacitive pens. 
Does this make sense? How could I improve the design? What materials would I need to build it myself. Assuming ready built arm? How could I build an array of capacitive touch micro pens?

A:

Since the screen of an iPad is your desired workspace, and all the arm will have to lift is a stylus, this will not have to be a large arm.  There are many "hobby" arms built with hobby airplane servos that will probably work for you.  I won't list any makes / models because there are many out there.  
I am not sure what your comment about lag is about, but if you want a fast arm, you should consider a Delta robot arm configuration.  Because the "standard" serial arms mentioned above are not very fast.  These are harder to come by.  the only hobby level delta arm i have seen was the Robot Army Starter Kit on Kickstarter.
