Q:

Find node that logged an error?

As the title says, when a ROS error (or warning, or info) message is printed, how do I find out which node it came from?

A:

Programmatically or just by looking at the logging output on the console?
If the latter, configure your ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT to include the node name.
