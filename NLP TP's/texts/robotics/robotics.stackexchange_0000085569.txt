Q:

Machine Learning Algorithm

Hey,
Would it be possible to know which Machine Learning Algorithm was used to find leg patterns in the returned laser scans reading in the leg_detector ROS package (http://wiki.ros.org/leg_detector) ?
Greetings,
Ilyass

Do you mean http://wiki.ros.org/skeleton_markers?
As far as i know , machine learning is not used . Robotics still works on deterministic classical approach .

https://github.com/wg-perception/people/blob/indigo-devel/leg_detector/src/leg_detector.cpp
This is the source code pertaining to the leg_detector .
I am not sure exactly what algorithm they are using in this .

A:

It is an implementation of this paper
