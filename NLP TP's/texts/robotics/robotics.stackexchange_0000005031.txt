Q:

Connect to video stream with Java app instead of console and mplayer

I'm building a quadcopter using Raspberry Pi. There is the Pi Camera connected to the Raspberry Pi which is streaming the captured video. I can connect to this stream via Wi-Fi on my notebook (Linux) by using the console command "nc" and then show it by "mplayer".
What I want to do though is avoid the console commands and connect to this stream directly through my Java application. The reason is I want to do some image processing operations with this video so I need to have it in my application.
Is there anyone able to help me?

A:

Alternatively, you could embrace the console commands instead of avoiding them, and still have it interact with your java program.  This would have the advantage of continuing to deliver the video stream to the notebook even if the java program fails.
I'd look at mkfifo, which will make a special file on your system that the java program could open for processing.
To put data into that file, use the tee command to copy the input data from STDIN to both STDOUT and the FIFO file you created.
e.g. 
bash# mkfifo /path/to/myOutputFifo
bash# nc | tee /path/to/myOutputFifo | mplayer

Then, point your java program at /path/to/myOutputFifo for input.
