Q:

Rosdep failed to detect successful installation of [boost --with-python] on MacOS 10.9.5

My environment:
Mac OS maverick, 10.9.5; Xcode 6.0.1
I basically followed the instruction here: 
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
Error:

$rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y 
executing command [brew install boost --with-python]
Warning: boost-1.56.0 already installed
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
homebrew: Failed to detect successful installation of [boost --with-python]

I have both boost and boost-python installed by homebrew:

$brew list
autoconf        eigen           icon-naming-utils   libyaml         pyqt            urdfdom
automake        flann           ilmbase         log4cxx         qhull           urdfdom_headers

Thanks Tiberius! So basically I just ignore the complaints by rosdep and continue the catkin compilation?
Comment by nikai on 2014-10-03:
Actually I have the new errors:
CMake Error at cmake/empy.cmake:29 (message):
Unable to find either executable 'empy' or Python module 'em'...  try
installing the package 'python-empy'
How did you resolve this?
Comment by Tiberius on 2014-10-03:
Yeah! I got that one too! I just installed it. I did like http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source says. There is a section about it.
