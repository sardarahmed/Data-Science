Q:

schunk_svh_driver : Can't locate node svh_controller in package schunk_svh_driver

Hi,
I download the packages schunk_svh_driver(
Source: git https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/schunk_svh_driver.git)
in /opt/ros/indigo/share
and so, I Install the package by calling: apt-get install ros-indigo-schunk-svh-driver, but if I launch the controller node by calling : roslaunch schunk_svh_driver svh_controller.launch standalone:=true I get an error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [schunk_svh_driver/svh_controller]: can't locate node [svh_controller] in package [schunk_svh_driver].
Can you help me please?

Can you clarify how you installed the package? Did you use apt-get, or did you clone it using git?

Hi, I clone it calling: sudo git clone https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/schunk_svh_driver.git.

And where do you clone it? In /opt/ros/indigo/share?

A:

I clone it calling: sudo git clone https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/schunk_svh_driver.git

Packages you clone from github (or any package that you download the sources of) will need to be build in a catkin workspace before you can use them. If you really must install it from source, see the catkin tutorials for how to do this. Don't do this in /opt/ros/indigo/share (in fact, never do this), but in a workspace you create in your home directory (for instance).
I'd really recommend you install it using sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-schunk-svh-driver as shown on the schunk_svh_driver wiki page, as that will already install the binaries and remove the need to build everything yourself.
The wiki page also shows you how to correctly setup everything the first time you use the package.

Thank you for the answer. Are the drivers installed using sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-schunk-svh-driver the same that I can clone using git? Because using sudo apt-get I can move only 2 fingers of chunk hand (ring and little) when I launch roslaunch schunk_svh_driver svh_controller.launch.

They should be, or at least very close.
If you have troubles using the driver, please open a new question here, on ROS Answers, or open an issue on the issue tracker of the package.

Also: don't forget to remove the cloned schunk_svh_driver directory from /opt/ros/indigo/share if it is still there (the debian pkg also installs files there, so make sure you don't remove those).

thanks a lot!

The released version is the same as the Github Version. There might be very minor fixes in the Github version but they should not be notable to the average user. It can have several reasons that some fingers are not moving, look at the troubleshooting section at the wiki page for further details
