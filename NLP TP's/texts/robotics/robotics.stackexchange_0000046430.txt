thanks.. but I made it... its works ok... thats no the problem.... the problem is when the robot runs with a programmed nxt-python ... is this case rviz cant visualize the programmed motion sequence...

A:

For visualization in rviz, you first need to create a robot description file. Have a look at these tutorials. After you have the URDF file, you need to make sure that you are getting your robot's joint states and run the robot state publisher node. One of the tutorials I mentioned shows how.
