Q:

rosservice call error

I followed this tutorial and configure the service and the c++ code (and make it).
At the end I could not call the service by:

rosservice call
/ExecuteCartesianIKTrajectory --
"{header: { frame_id: /base_link},
poses: [{position: [0.76, -0.19,
0.83], orientation:[0.02, -0.09, 0.0, 1.0]}, {position: [0.59, -0.36, 0.93], orientation: [0.65, -0.21, .38,
.62]}]}"

I received:

ERROR: Service
[/ExecuteCartesianIKTrajectory] is not
available.

But I can do:

rossrv show
ik_trajectory_tutorial/ExecuteCartesianIKTrajectory

What am I doing wrong?

A:

I think rossrv show just indicates if a service of type "ik_trajectory_tutorial/ExecuteCartesianIKTrajectory" exists. The error tells you that your service node (the node that offers that service) is not running...
