Q:

rosdep 0.10.22 Error 404

I have installed the newest version of rosdep and when I perform rosdep update I get the following output and the eventual error:

reading in sources list data from /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d

Query rosdistro index https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/rep137/releases/index.yaml
ERROR: error loading sources list:
HTTP Error 404: Not Found

I have checked and the file https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/rep137/releases/index.yaml does not exist.
Further information:
I have seen that what happens is that the script /usr/share/pyshared/rosdep2/ when calling rosdistro.get_index_urdl() it is taking the function in the file /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosdistro/init.py which has

DEFAULT_INDEX_URL = 'https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/rep137/releases/index.yaml'

I think that the error would not happen if the file /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/rosdistro/init.py was taken which has

DEFAULT_INDEX_URL = 'https://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/master/index.yaml'

A:

What is the contents of /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list? From the error message I would guess that you have an extra line in there referring to that url.
Edit:
Ahh you have a version from PIP overlaying the debian package.  Please repeatedly run
sudo pip uninstall rosdep
Until it says nothing to uninstall.
You should also uninstall any other ros tools in /usr/local installed via pip using the same procedure.
