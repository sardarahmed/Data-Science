A:

You should probably read up on some basic concepts regarding rviz, gmapping and generally "how stuff in ROS works :)" (the tutorials are a good start).
Rviz is the ROS Visualizer and mainly is useful for visualizing the robot and environment state. It does neither build maps, nor does it provide algorithms for searching for objects in them. It just allows you to visualize the map it receives from somewhere else (for example gmapping).
That being said, I am not aware of a existing approach that performs some kind of object recognition on occupancy grid maps (if that is what you require).

Thanks :) , but what i mean is how my robot can walk Automatic and freely in the map that has been built using rviz without neglecting parts of the map

That sounds completely different to your original question :) For navigation inside a map you can use the navigation stack. To automatically explore an environment you can have a look at the exploration stack or the hector_exploration_planner

Sorry for the inconvenience :) , but I built the map using gmapping..
Are these methods can be beneficial to me?

If you want your robot to navigate in that map, you can use the navigation stack. If you have a walking robot, that complicates things though, as the navigation stack is originally intended to be used with wheeled robots.
