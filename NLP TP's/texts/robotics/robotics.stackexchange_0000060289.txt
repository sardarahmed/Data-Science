Q:

Doubt regarding android rosjava publishers and subscribers for sensor_msgs.imu

Hi! I am relatively new to the android and rosjava development environment. I am carrying out an experiment in which I am using the android_sensors_driver to publish the phone sensor readings to the master running on my Ubuntu PC. Now, I want to subscribe to the topic /android/imu (as published by the android_sensors_driver) carry out a couple of operations (inside the phone) and finally re-publish the readings as /android/modified_imu. Can someone please give me some advice on how to write the publisher and subscriber nodes? Can I somehow modify the pubsub tutorial for my purpose?
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

A:

Just a quick response:
You would need rosjava to run everything on the phone. They have a pub/sub-Tutorial also. Basicly, you need to write one node, which subscribes to the /android/imu topic, just as described in the sub-tutorial. Instead of just printing it, you would then modify and publish it as described in the pub-tutorial to your desired topic.
You'll need to watch out for the message-types, since you aren't talking about strings anymore, but there is a section in the rosjava docs about how to use different message types.
Basicly: Go to the Rosjava documentation, follow their tutorials and in the end merge them to one node :)
Hope that helps,
Rabe
