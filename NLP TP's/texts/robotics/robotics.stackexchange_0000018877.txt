Q:

Robot mechanism parts names

I'm working on my first "robotic" project that involves a square platform that should drop one of the four sides at a time. 
     side 1
  A----------B
  |          |
4 |          | 2
  |          |
  D----------C
     side 3

My idea is to mount {something} in each corner [A, B, C, D] and for example to drop to side 1 I would pull down corners A and B. Then back up again and drop another side. The platform will be circa 150 x 150 mm and has to tilt to circa 45° therefore that {something} has to go down by around 150 mm as well.
What is that {something} that I should use? I was googling for a while but I don't know the right names for the parts, that makes googling quite challenging. Is it a gear rack? Or Linear actuator? Or some kind of electric piston? 
Is there any site somewhere for aspiring makers that lists the common parts and mechanism items? And ideally where to buy them cheap too (this is a little school project on a very limited budget).

A:

This is called a Stewart platform. You can use any linear actuator type, hydraulic, pneumatic or electric.
