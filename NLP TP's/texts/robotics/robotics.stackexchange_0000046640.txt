Q:

catkin / setup.py installation into devel space not working

Hey all,
I can't figure out how to correctly package a Python module so it shows up in my devel space after "catkin_make".  I've tried every combination of setup.py and CMakeLists.txt that I can think of.
Let's say I have a ROS package called "my_package", and I'd like to have a Python module defined by "my_package.py" containing a function called "def myfunc()", so that from a different package, I could do "import my_package; my_package.myfunc()".  After catkin_make, I expect things to be installed like this: devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/my_package.py.  How do I write a CMakeLists.txt and setup.py for this package?
If this configuration is impossible, how do you recommend I structure a simple ROS package providing Python modules?
Thanks for your help!
Edit: I'm using Groovy.

A:

There is a tutorial on that here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/Makefile
(click catkin) Section 2.2
Also some more info here:
http://ros.org/doc/groovy/api/catkin/html/user_guide/setup_dot_py.html
Note that catkin does not put your my_package.py in the devel space, it uses the one in your source space via some python voodoo, so in your devel space you will just get some init.py.

Thanks; this answered my question.  It would be helpful if the init.py voodoo were documented somewhere (at least for people like me who are curious how the devel space works).
