Q:

pointcloud_to_laserscan with ldmrs data

Hello,
I am trying  to covert Pointcloud2 msgs obtained by a SICK LD-MRS four layer scanner to Laserscan msgs. i tried to use the pointcloud_to_laserscan package, but it did not work. Following is what i get:
$ roslaunch pointcloud_to_laserscan sample_node.launch

*It reports that "ResourceNotFound: openni2_launch", and then I tried *
$ rospack find openni2

*and i get *
[rospack] Error: package 'openni2' not found

What can I do now? can anybody help? Thanks
