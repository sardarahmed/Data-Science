Q:

"gzserver: symbol lookup error" (not ignition problem) when launching Gazebo v9.19 in Ubuntu 18.04

When I try to launch the Gazebo from terminal;
gazebo --verbose

this error occurs. I really can't understand what is the meaning of this "undefined symbol". I don't now how can I fix this problem. (Also I'm using ROS melodic but I just can't launch Gazebo as you can see above so I don't know is it important.)

This looks like a version mismatch between gazebo and libsdformat. Can you tell me which version of libsdformat you have installed? You can do this with apt-cache policy libsdformat6
Comment by Mustafa on 2021-12-06:
@azeey installed version of libsdformat6 is 6.2.0.1~bionic.

A:

Gazebo 9.19 needs libsdformat6 >= 6.3.0. It should have been installed when installing/upgrading
the gazebo9 package, but it looks like your system still has 6.2.0. Upgrading or reinstalling libsdformat6 should resolve your issue.
