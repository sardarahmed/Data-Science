Q:

Compress Image topic with h264 streaming for low bandwidth connection?

Hello,
I faced the problem that sending the video with big resolution (1920x1080) is very difficult even with image transport. The raw or compressed images are too bit for sending over the network (WiFi) and the theora also can't handle such resolution (fps is too low).
Maybe someone was working with sending big image and can help me where can I find or how can I implement for example h264 streaming. Or maybe there are additional plugins for image_transport?
Thank you!

A:

I haven't used it myself, but you could see whether daniilidis-group/ffmpeg_image_transport can help. It's an FFMPEG based image_transport plugin, which supports any format supported by FFMPEG (including h264 and h265). HW accelerated encoding/decoding is also supported (such as nvenc fi).
There are other image_transport plugins which purport to do a similar thing, but they all look rather old/stale:

tilk/h264_image_transport (more recent / up-to-date fork: yoshito-n-students/codec_image_transport)
orchidproject/x264_image_transport (more recent Clearpath fork: clearpathrobotics/x264_image_transport)

Thank you for your help, I have tried ffmpeg_image_transport and it seems to work. However, the encoding isn't to much in the first look, it is probably needs some configuration adjustments. So I will try.
Thank you!!!
