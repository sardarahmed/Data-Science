Q:

ros-fuerte-pcl running with ros-electric

I am currently using ros-electric-perception-pcl(1.0.2) and its addons with ros-electric. I would like to know how stable it is if I upgrade to ros-fuerte-pcl while keeping the ros version of ros-electric. I'm just afraid I'll have a lot of dependencies problems and other weird behavior of it later on if I upgrade it.
Any feedbacks..
Thanks in advance.

A:

You should never mix-and-match between distributions.  You'll end up getting all sorts of ABI compatibility problems that aren't worth it.
