Q:

Publishing and subscribing to a topic in different threads

Hi all!
I was just curious about this, before I actually sit for coding.
Suppose I have a thread in which I am publishing to a topic. Then, can I subscribe
to that same topic from some different thread?
I am really sorry if this question is too trivial. I just don't want to end up
writing code for nothing :)
All help is appreciated!

A:

Yes, you can do this.
In fact, if you're in c++, if you use the shared_ptr signatures in your code, you will even skip the serialization/deserialization step.
Do note, however, that by default roscpp only uses a single thread if you use ros::spin() or ros::spinOnce().
For more info on roscpp threading models and how to use multiple threads with roscpp, see here.
