Q:

kinect install instructions for electric not working

http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect
I've tried the apt-get install and the source based for electric on Ubuntu 11.10.
When I run the following command it errors out.
punchingpro@punchingpro:~/ros_workspace/drivers$ rosmake openni_kinect --rosdep-install
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['openni_kinect']

A:

Ok, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems you've been following this tutorial to get your kinect up and running:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect
I briefly attempted to follow this tutorial as well, and it got me good and stuck with the same rosdep errors for Lucid.
If you're running the a recent version of ROS Electric, then you already have the open_kinect stack here: /opt/ros/electric/stacks/openni_kinect
Simply remove the tutorial's openni_ros folder from your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. In your specific case:
rm -r ~/ros_workspace/openni_ros

Then launch your kinect!
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
