Q:

What is float64?

Many ROS message uses the date type float64 so  I decided to use this type in my code but I have this error:
   error: ‘float64’ does not name a type
             private: float64 direction_x_;
                      ^

I cannot find out the definition of float64. Anyone can tell me what files I should include to find out this data type definition?

A:

Dan's answer is correct for describing what a float64 is.
If you want to get rid of the error you are seeing you probably need to have the following in your source (or header) file:
#include <std_msgs/Float64.h>

and change your variable declaration to:
std_msgs::Float64 direction_x_;

Check out the std_msgs and float64 wiki pages. You may also need to add std_msgs to your package.xml and CMakeLists.txt files in your package.

Thank you @Dan, @Thomas. Actually, these two answers combine to be the best answer. But in the std_msgs/Float64 there is one filed "float64 data". It seems that the initial float64 is defined elsewhere. What's the source?
