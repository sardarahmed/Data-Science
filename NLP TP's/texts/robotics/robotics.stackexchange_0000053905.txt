Q:

USARSim and ROS integration

I have my own map and robot placed in the Map through USARSim. Since I have installed USARSim in Windows7 and ROS runs on Linux. So; what should I do--1)install ROS and USARSim both in Linux or 2)On windows7 use virtualbox to install Linux and then on Linux install ROS?
Question 2: Which version of ROS should be installed? Groovy or hydro?
Question 3: Gazebo or Usarsim which one is best to work with ROS?
Has anyone correctly use this framework upto high level navigation? I am stuck at creation of 2D global map.

A:

It might be worth considering to use USARSimROS (it might be developed by someone in development team of USARSim at Georgia Tech though I'm not sure). Looks like it's actively maintained, although from this wiki page I sensed that it may have been tested with ROS electric and fuerte.

Hello, IsaacSaito. as I find some bugs in USARSimROS, so I decided to write my own node to communicate with ROS. I want to use its gmapping and laser scan messege and teleop package. For High level navigation I Will only refer to 2D map....Can I do that?

I confirm that USARSimROS is pretty buggy. There are at least two:

messages from ROS are not correctly routed to USARSim (actually speed commands are considered sensors measurements!)
the tf tree misses some nodes (in particular, the /lms200)

@kr1zz I'm not a maintainer. Opening tickets for what you observed might be appreciated by its users and developers http://sourceforge.net/p/usarsimros/tickets/

Hi @IsaacSaito, thanks for the reply. Unfortunately the ticketing system seems closed (or, at least, I did not manage to open a new one :P ). However I mailed the authors about these issues some times ago.

Hinomiyagura Team Description Paper for
Robocup 2013 Virtual Robot League uses USARSim/ROS..and MRL Team Description Paper for Virtual Robots Competition 2013 also uses USARSimROS.
