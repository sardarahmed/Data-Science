Q:

Tf from optical frame to odometry frame

I am acquiring point cloud and image data from Kinect sensor. The coordinate frame for the data acquired is:-
X axis--> right
Y axis--> downwards
Z axis--> forward
and the odometry(standard /map axis) has coordinate axis as such:-
X axis--> forward
Y axis--> left
Z axis--> upwards
What would be a static transform between the two frames ??

A:

Normally you should not define a direct transform between the optical frame of the kinect and your odometry. If you are using the ros openni driver, there is a camera_link frame with the depth- and optical-frames as children. This is using the standard x-forward terminology and should be used for setting the transform from base_link. There you only have to worry about the offsets in x, y anz z and maybe some rotation to account for the Kinect mounting.
Additionally you may want to have a look at REP 103 regarding the standard axis orientations.
P.S. to answer the inital question: You would need the set the offsets (x,y,z) and then in fixed axis RPY: -pi/2, 0, -pi/2. (at least i think so :))

Why do you want to do a direct transform from base_link to the optical frame? Using the openni driver the optical frame would have two parents, which is invalid! You need only two rotations because you always rotate the whole coordinate system.

What do you mean with: "If you are using the ros openni driver, there is a camera_link frame with the depth- and optical-frames as children" ? I am using the ros openni driver but it does not publish any tf information, i have to do that myself. This is why I want to do the same as the question.
