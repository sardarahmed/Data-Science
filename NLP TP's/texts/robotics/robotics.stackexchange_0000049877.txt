Q:

Error with the bumblebee2 package

Hi guys !
I am getting this error when i try to compile the bumblebee2 package of Columbia University :

[ rosmake ] All 32 linesumblebee2: 4.2 sec ]                                                                                                                                      [ 1 Active 45/46 Complete ]

Perhaps you should add the directory containing `camera_info_manager.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable

Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
broken dependency!

I already installed the camera_info_manager package and it compiles without any failure.
This is what i get with the roscd pkg :

anis@anis-Precision-M4500:~/rgbdslam_workspace$ roscd camera_info_manager
anis@anis-Precision-M4500:~/rgbdslam_workspace/sandbox/image_common-groovy-devel/camera_info_manager$

I looked for the "camera_info_manager.pc" file in all my system and i don't find it.

Hi guys i fixed the problem by replacing the camera_info_manager by an other one that i found on the version 1.6 of the image_common stack
image_common-1.6/camera_info_manager
