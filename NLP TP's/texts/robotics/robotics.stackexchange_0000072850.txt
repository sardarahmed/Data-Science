Q:

Waiting for server.. UR5 arm

What I'm trying to do is getting the UR5 talking to ROS, i experience a problem with executing the node test_move.py after bringing up the UR5 and had no trouble with that using this command
roslaunch ur_bringup ur5_bringup.launch robot_ip:=192.168.1.200 [reverse_port:=50001]
and also got a message saying " Robot connected"
But trying to run the node test_move.py in a different window , it only showes "waiting for server..." and it never execute it.
I'm using Indigo and firmware version 1.8. Any idea on how can i fix this problem?
Thank you very much in advance

How do I know which firmware version I am using? I am trying to figure out if the modern driver is right for me

A:

I have solved this problem by downloading the package ur_modern_driver from
https://github.com/ThomasTimm/ur_modern_driver instead of the package from Universal Robots (ur_driver)
