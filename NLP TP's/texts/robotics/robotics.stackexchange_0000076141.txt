Q:

[vn200.launch] is neither a launch file in package

Hi All,
I got vectornav vn200, and I have followed exactly this tutorial : https://github.com/dawonn/vectornav
When I write "roslaunch vectornav vn200.launch", I get an error:
[vn200.launch] is neither a launch file in package [vectornav] nor is [vectornav] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

I don't really know why I get such an error ( I am totally beginner with Linux, ROS, and VectorNav ^^ ).
But, when I go to the following directory ~/catkin_ws/src/vectornav/launch
and I write the comman again roslaunch vn200.launch I get the following
... logging to /home/quuser/.ros/log/3dbda9a8-740b-11e6-9178-6c88140d9b00/roslaunch-quuser-5083.log

Could you please let me know how i can overcome this error.

Any error when you compiled? If the compilation is successful, you should be able to do "roscd vectornav" without any error.

I get the following error when doing "roscd vectornav"
roscd: No such package/stack 'vectornav'

hello ,did you solve this problem ?

A:

Go to directory YOUR_CATKIN_WORKSPACE/devel/lib, and see if there is a folder vectornav. If so, see if there is a executable vn200_node in vectornav.
And also, you should setup the workspace environment, source YOUR_CATKIN_WORKSPACE/devel/setup.bash from your terminal.

Hi Shay,
Yes there is an executable vn200_node in vectornav. Apparently I had to source the setup.bash : ) you are correct.
