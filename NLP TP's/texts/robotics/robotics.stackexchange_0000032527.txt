Please keep in mind that answers.ros is not a place to hold your hand through every step of the ROS process.  It is a way to get questions answered, and see previous questions that have been asked.

A:

start here after reading the general overview
once you've gone through each tutorial, you'll need to read up on the navigation stack
You'll probably want to mimic the configuration of a turtlebot so you can leverage their pointcloud to laserscan node as well as their teleop and odometry nodes.
