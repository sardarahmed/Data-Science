turtlebot   hg   e47d5a1dca1c kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot

A:

That's a known bug:
https://kforge.ros.org/vcstools/trac/ticket/65
Will be fixed after next release, until then, do the merge manually, just call
roslocate info turtlebot
and add the resulting test at the bottom of your .rosinstall file.
