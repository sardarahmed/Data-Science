Q:

ImportError: No module named genpy

I am very new to ROS as I just started installing it on my Ubuntu 16.4 (I am fully aware that there hasn't been a version of ROS released for Ubuntu 16.4.) but so far all my installation went smoothly except when I tried to run the 'rostopic' line it gives me:
"Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/rostopic", line 34, in 
import rostopic
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rostopic/init.py", line 59, in 
import genpy
ImportError: No module named genpy"
Anyone can tell me how to fix it? Thanks in advance.

A:

I had the same problem, but only because I did not complete installation instructions.
Setting up environment correctly  ( $ source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash ) fixed this.
