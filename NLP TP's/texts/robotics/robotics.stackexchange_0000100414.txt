Q:

Use ROS_ info to output std::vector data

If I'm dealing with std::vector data in C++ and I'd like to print it on the output stream I can do something similar to what is shown below:
std::cout << "Data Retrieved: \n";
std::copy(data.begin(), data.end(), std::ostream_iterator<double>(std::cout, " "));
std::cout << std::endl;

How might I reproduce this behavior using ROS_INFO to display the data on the console as new data is received?
Thank you!

A:

It should be easy to use a std::stringstream to accomplish what you want. Moreover, it might be a bit cleaner to use ROS_INFO_STREAM for this particular application. Something like this:
  std::stringstream ss;
  ss << "Data Retrieved: \n";
  std::copy(data.begin(), data.end(), std::ostream_iterator<double>(ss, " "));
  ss << std::endl;
  ROS_INFO_STREAM(ss.str());
