Q:

How to set build order/dependencies

In my workspace I have created 3 packages - 2 nodes and a library.  I use catkin_make to build, however it compiles the packages alphabetically; the nodes first then the library.  I get compiler errors because the library isn't built yet
Eg..
make[2]: *** No rule to make target /catkin_ws/devel/lib/libmrls_lib.so', needed by catkin_ws/devel/lib/mrls_laser_range_finder/mrls_laser_range_finder_node'.  Stop
I can compile everything if I manually make the library first, eg..
catkin_make mrls_lib
I've added the library package to find_package() in CMakeLists.txt.  Have I missed something?

A:

Do you have a package dependency in the package.xml?

Ah ha!  That was it.  The <build_depend> tag.
