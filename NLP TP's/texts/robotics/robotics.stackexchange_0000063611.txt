Q:

How do you calibrate the extrinsic parameters?

I was trying to calibrate my camera mounted on the robot base so that I can get the transform from base_link to camera_link. i was looking for efficient and fast ways to do this and I found the following calibration algorithm which was useful because I could fix my pattern on the robot base directly and use a mirror to make it visible to the camera.
After doing some tests with that, the results were totally wrong. I also tested with a webcam mounted on my pc and I couldn't get good results.
How do the ROS community proceed with the extrinsic calibration of a monocular camera?

A:

You might be interested in the industrial_calibration package from the ROS-Industrial community. Also: Industrial Calibration Library Update and Presentation.
It can be a bit involved to get it working at the moment, but that is being worked on. If you find you need help with anything, don't hesitate to send a mail to the ROS-Industrial mailing list (or ask here on ROS Answers of course).

That doesn't work with melodic.

You're commenting on a 5 year old Q&A. I'm not surprised that pkg may not work on Melodic.
