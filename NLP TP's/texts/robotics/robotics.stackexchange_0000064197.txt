Q:

Error: package 'parser' not found

Hi,
I'm trying to follow http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Parse%20a%20urdf%20file after having completed all of the introductory tutorials.
I think I may not be following some of the shorthand in this tutorial correctly.  I believe I have created the parser.cpp file and the URDF file in the correct locations within ~/catkin_ws/src/testbot_description/.
At the  end of the tutorial it says "build your package and run it".  I navigate to ~/catkin_ws/src/ and run catkin_make.  This appears successful because the results end with
[100%] Built target parser

But should I be seeing a new file somewhere called "parser"?  I don't see anything except the original parser.cpp file.  Now I can't understand the very last tutorial instruction.  It says:
  $ .<path>/parser <path>my_robot.urdf
  # ./devel/lib/robot_description/parser /src/robot_description/urdf/my_robot.urdf (for example)

I've tried navigating to ~/catkin_ws/src/testbot_description and entering:
./src/parser /urdf/my_robot.urdf

But this returns:
bash: ./src/parser: No such file or directory

The following question appears to ask the same question, but the answer to the last step is not included: http://answers.ros.org/question/148686/tutorial-parse-a-urdf-file/
That suggests I should be calling rosrun <PKG> <NAME> instead of the approach used in the tutorial.  I think that means I should be calling rosrun parser my_robot.urdf or maybe rosrun parser /urdf/my_robot.urdf but running either of those still gives me:
[rospack] Error: package 'parser' not found

I think maybe I just don't have the syntax correct for this last step, but I can't figure it out from looking at the tutorial, that other question, or the rosrun documentation.  Any pointers?  Thank you!

A:

Catkin follows the out-of-source build paradigm. So the binaries aren't located in your source folder. In your case they are located in ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/<package>.
This line you posted # ./devel/lib/robot_description/parser /src/robot_description/urdf/my_robot.urdf (for example) is correct, but you have to be in your catkin root directory.
The seconds approach you posted is also correct. But <PKG> is your package testbot_description and <NAME> the name of your node parser. Then append the arguments for your node <path to your urdf>. The correct command then looks like rosrun testbot_description parser <path to your urdf>
