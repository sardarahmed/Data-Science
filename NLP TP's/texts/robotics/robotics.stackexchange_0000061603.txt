Q:

Syncronization of Timestamps

Hello everyone,
Currently I am logging the IMU data , GPS data and other data but since these nodes log data at different frequencies , my post processing is pointless ( Timestamps are different ). I need to find out a way by which I can synchronize all the data so I can do my post processing.
Thank you in advance,
Naz

Are you using this data for robot_pose_ekf?

I am using this data for my research on Cooperative Navigation.

robot_pose_ekf is a filtering node for more accurate position. Didnt mean for what project are you using it for. Sorry.

A:

You can use the ExactTime and ApproximateTime Synchronization methods in ROS.

In the answer at the link below, there is a sample code that subscribes to two point clouds and uses ApproximateTime policy for synchronization.
