Q:

ROS on roomba icreate

I plan to buy a roomba icreate to test out simple algorithms etc on it. I wish to know if ROS (diamondback/electric) is installable on roomba icreate. Any first hand experience would be most welcome.

A:

Yes there are drivers and packages for the roomba icreate base. Actually one of the many supported robots, Turtlebot uses the roomba icreate base. But I assume you already know you would need a computer running a compatible OS in order to get things up and running. See this page for some ideas on installation http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation . And if your up to it you could assemble your own Turtlebot. Check out one of my favorite blog sites for some ideas on building your own turtlebot from scratch. http://profmason.com/?paged=2
