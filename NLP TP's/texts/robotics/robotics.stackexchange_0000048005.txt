Q:

Writing a realtime joint controller [Tutorial]

Hello everyone,
I am doing the "Writing a realtime joint controller" tutorial. So far I have followed it closely and have checked that the plugin is visible to rospack using:
rospack plugins --attrib=plugin pr2_controller_interface

I can see the .xml file inside. Then when I go to the next tutorial, Running a realtime joint controller, it starts by launching the pr2 in Gazebo (which I do not want), rather I am using my own robot which publishes /joint_state, therefore I skipped to (4.) Running the Controller. I did the configuring but when I tried to check the status of other controllers by running:
rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager list

I see nothing on the list. Does anyone what is going on here? Thanks in advance.
Kind Regards,
Martin

A:

I think you got it right with other questions. You need a specific code defining transmission in your robot URDF to pr2_controller_manager to be able to see it.
