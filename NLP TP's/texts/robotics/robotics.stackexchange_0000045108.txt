Q:

I can not launch the sample code

Hello,
I am a real beginner in ROS area. I have started with a tutorial, which is based on gazebo. Here it is: link text
On page 10, I have written the p3dx.launch file as:
<launch>
<include file="$(find p2os_urdf)/launch/upload_pioneer3dx.xml"/>
<!-- push robot_description to factory and spawn robot in gazebo -->
<node name="spawn_pioneer" pkg="gazebo" type="spawn_model" args="-z 0.051
-urdf -param robot_description -model robot_description" respawn="false"
 output="screen" />
 <!-- Controller Manager -->
 <include file="$(find pr2_controller_manager)/controller_manager.launch"
 />
 <!-- load controllers -->
 <node name="diffdrive" pkg="gazebo_plugins" type="gazebo_ros_diffdrive"
 respawn="true" output="screen"/>
 </launch>

and saved it to my Documents file.
Then I have started gazebo with an empty world by: roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
Then I am trying to lauch the p3dx.launch file by: roslaunch p3dx.launch
but I am getting this:
... logging to /home/tuba/.ros/log/3b7c26aa-1b8c-11e2-aba8-00e04c534458/roslaunch-ubuntu-2871.log

There should be robot in gazebo world but it does not appear. Why? (This seems that I have a very basic problem, sorry!)

A:

That suggests that you have not installed the p2os_urdf package, or do not have it in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
