Q:

Rviz 2D estimated pose configuration

Hi guys,
Regarding to the rviz 2D pose estimation, does anyone have an idea of the yaw angle or direction of robot facing every time we relocate robot position with it?
Is it possible to set the yaw angle to my desired angle?

A:

When you initialize the pose you click on the position and drag the direction that you want to initialize the heading.
