Q:

How do I set global cmake flags catkin

Hi all,
So far I have only used catkin to do a normal build using catkin_make and a release build using catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.
However, I would like to set more CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and various other options globally for multiple packages in my workspace. How do I do this?
Do I modify the top level cmake? Are there any examples for the same?

A:

catkin_make --help will show that it accepts any CMake arguments with -Dname=value.

Thank you Dirk. Would it be possible to set these flags in /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake? Or override the CMakeLists.txt in your workspace?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2015-01-25:
Technically yes, you can replace the symlink of the CMake file in the root of your workspace with a modified version. Or even change the system wide file. But I would recommend passing the parameter once - it is persistent and you don't have to pass it again.

I would recommend a CMake toolchain file for this. It will allow you to set settings for all packages.

Great answers. Dirk, its good to know I only have to do this once.
William, so I do catkin_make -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/myToolChain.cmake. In this file I can enter lines like: set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++0x ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}). Is this correct?

Something like that, the toolchain file is mostly for cross-compiling, but you could use it for this. I'd suggesting looking at: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html

Thank you guys. Will add a note somewhere in the wiki when I get it running
