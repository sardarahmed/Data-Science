Q:

(Groovy | 12.04 | armv7l) bash: rosrun: command not found

I ran the following commands:
$ roscore
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

and obtained the following error:
bash: rosrun: command not found

My environment reads:
root@localhost:~# export | grep ROS
declare -x ROS_DISTRO="groovy"
declare -x ROS_ETC_DIR="/opt/ros/groovy/etc/ros"
declare -x ROS_MASTER_URI="http://localhost:11311"
declare -x ROS_PACKAGE_PATH="/home/ubuntu/ros_ws:/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stacks"
declare -x ROS_ROOT="/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros"

And was not able to find the rosrun file at /opt/ros/groovy/bin
Any suggestions?

How did you install ROS? If you installed from debs, which debs did you install?

I used this link --> http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/raw/groovy/desktop

A:

The env variable you need for this is PATH:
$ env | grep ^PATH=
PATH=/opt/ros/groovy/bin:...

This entry is added by sourcing /opt/ros/groovy/setup.*sh

It does have the PATH info that you mention.
