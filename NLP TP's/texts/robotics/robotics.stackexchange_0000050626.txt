Q:

How to build a custom 'stageros' using catkin?

Hi,
Due to stageros does not fit all my requirements, I need to do some modifications to source code. My questions are:
What files should I add to my package?
How should I modify CMakelists.txt in my new package for build the modified stageros.cpp?
Do I have to add libstage library to my package?
I'm using ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04.
Thanks,
Gustavo.

A:

Finally stage was splited in ros-hydro-stage and ros-hydro-stage-ros in hydro, so I could modify stage-ros and it depends on stage.
