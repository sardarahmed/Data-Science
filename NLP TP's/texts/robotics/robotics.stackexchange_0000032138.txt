Q:

OpenCV modification and re-compiling

Hi all,
I need to modify an OpenCV module (ML) and I would like to know how I can do it for the version of OpenCV included in ROS.
Thank you
Walter

A:

Walter, it is not recommended to recompile the source if you installed via debs. In fact, for OpenCV, the source won't even be there as it is cleaned out after compilation and before the deb is built.
What you should do is to checkout a source version of the stack containing OpenCV, into your own directory and make changes there.
