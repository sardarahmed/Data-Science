Q:

No transform from [right_leg] to [/base_link]

I was developing my URDF robot model, using ros tutorials as reference, and got my second error (the first was this).
I'm using exactly multipleshapes example, but when I try it, this error happens:
"right_leg
No transform from [right_leg] to [/base_link]"

You should try out some of the debugging approaches laid out in the tf wiki troubleshooting page.

Okay, I'll debug, but I'm using the same code as the tutorial. It MUST work. The tutorial can't teach us wrong. NOTE: I can't install the urdf_tutorial package, so I'm running using the simples command "rosrun rviz rviz"

@Vinipsmaker. I ran into the same problem when doing the tutorial. Did you ever manage to figure out what went wrong? I tried to debug but tf_echo gives no output and tf_monitor says "tf_monitor waiting for time to be published". I use Indigo btw.
