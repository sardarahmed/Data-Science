Q:

Stage Tutorial Error: Laser Model Type Not Found

Ubuntu 1210
Nvidia GeForce GT640M
Groovy
Followed Tutorial in:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/stage/Tutorials/IntroductiontoStageControllers
Successfully downloaded: http://mobotica.googlecode.com/files/stage_controllers.tar.gz
Successfully extracted
Successfully found by rospack find
Filesystem structure for stage_controller looks fine
But when I try to do: rosrun stage stageros /home/vmrguser/rosGWS/sandbox/stage_controllers/world/roomba-wander.world
Or any other world configuration, I get the following behavior:

Stage simulation window opens and then closes
Console says:
err: Model type laser not found in model typetable (/tmp/buildd/ros-groovy-stage-1.6.7/debian/ros-groovy-stage/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/stage/build/stage/libstage/world.cc CreateModel)

Not sure why this happens

Hi, Have you solved the problem for using stage simulations, i have exactly the same problem, I am getting the following message
err: Model type laser not found in model typetable (/tmp/buildd/ros-groovy-stage-1.6.7/debian/ros-groovy-stage/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/stage/build/stage/libstage/world.cc

A:

Groovy has Stage 4, which no longer provides the laser device simulation. It has been replaced by a generic ranger simulation.
It looks like the ROS stage wiki page documentation is out of date.
Old world files need to be ported to the new interface.

how can one port an old world file to the new interface?

You will have to consult the Stage documentation for that.
