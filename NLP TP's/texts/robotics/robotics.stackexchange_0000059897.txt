The goal of using callback based action clients is to avoid using waitForResult and having different callbacks for result and feedback, which is not the case in the link you sent me. The purpose of this is to use only the feedback from the action and not the result. (Continuous face recognition in face_recognition package for example)

If you're not calling an action for the result, you might want to rethink your use of actionlib. You can also look at the Actionlib API documentation: http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/actionlib/html/index.html .

Ok thanks. Would you suggest something for that use case? activating/disabling face recognition for example

activating and deactivating image processing pipelines is tricky. They usually have some temporal state, and a pretty significant startup time. I've seen solutions that only run the pipeline when there is a subscriber. You could also try using capabilities to start and stop the node.
