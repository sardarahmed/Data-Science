Q:

Perform calculation in .launch file

Hi all,
I wondered if it is possible to do a calculation in a roslaunch file, something like:
<arg name="windowsize" default="20"/>

<node pkg="gmapping" type="slam_gmapping" name="slam_gmapping" output="screen" clear_params="true">
    <param name="xmin" value="$(arg -windowsize/2)" />
    <param name="ymin" value="$(arg  -windowsize/2)" />
    <param name="xmax" value="$(arg  windowsize/2)" />
    <param name="ymax" value="$(arg  windowsize/2)" />
</node>

I have tried several combinations, all without luck. And I can't seem to find anything about it on the web...
I really do need to be able to use the 'windowsize' argument, rather than 4 x/ymax/min arguments, to support some interface I made with other nodes I made...

A:

This is possible starting from Kinetic thanks to the  eval keyword:
For example:
<param name="circumference" value="$(eval 2.* 3.1415 * arg('radius'))"/>

Works on Melodic as well as Noetic. Tried and tested  ...
It is the correct way to do math operations in launch file
