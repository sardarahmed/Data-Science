Q:

brightness of uvc_camera on Hydro armhf

Hi,
Although uvc_camera works, the brightness settings are set to maximum and looking at https://github.com/ktossell/camera_umd/blob/master/uvc_camera/src/uvc_cam.cpp this is hardcoded. So my question is if/how I can change this without (much) hassle ? I don't have a calibration xml file, and doubt using one will overrule the cpp settings. Right now I have to work in semi-darkness to get some nice images.
Thanks.

A:

I've removed the hardcoded values. New .deb packages should be available soon. If you are using a USB Video Class camera, you could try http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera , which has more parameter support and usually delivers new images more quickly.

Thank you for this. After running it successfully at first, I now find a problem: "uvc_open: Access denied (-3)". Apart from chmod o+rw /dev/video0, I didn't change any settings. What may be the cause of this ?

You must not have write access to /dev/bus/usb/[BUS#]/[DEV#]. Have you set up any udev files as in http://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera#Permissions ? If you previously gave yourself permission using, e.g., chmod a+rw /dev/bus/usb/BUS/DEV, then that permission will be reset when you unplug the camera.

libuvc doesn't use /dev/videoX -- it takes over the role of the Linux driver that normally creates /dev/video. In fact, when libuvc_camera is running, /dev/video0 should disappear.

Had to restore the system and set up again. Now, setting the permissions on /dev/bus was the issue. Will that permission be set automatically? I didnt set it when I ran it the first time but it did work.
