Q:

ROS node bridge for publish special topics over the internet

Hello,
I want a ROS node bridge to subscribe some topics (on my ros machine) and publish them over the internet, to other node that listen this and publish this in another machine with ROS.
I want that each machine have a roscore running in an independent way.
Is there any tool or package to do this? or should I do my own node for each situation?
Regards,
Filipe

A:

Not sure what you mean by an "independent way", but take a look at the Multimaster SIG, and also (and likely more relevant for typical applications) the Network Setup page on the wiki.
In both cases you'll have to make sure that the machines in question can communicate without issue in both directions.
