Q:

The robot's actual behavior/tasks?

I've had a look at smach. It's promising when it comes to defining what the robot shall actually do on a high abstraction level. But it seems to me that smach has kind of fallen asleep. Is it actively maintained or even developed further? The last commit on GitHub was made on 4th of August, 2013. There are several open issues. And it seems that smach_viewer isn't working with ROS Hydro which is the greatest pity since I could really make good use of a visual representation of what I've been doing (if not for documentation purposes).
Are there any alternatives to program behaviors and activities as comfortable as smach that are actively maintained, alive and kicking?
Thanks

A:

I think smach is still under active development. Latest changes have been committed during the last 30 days. smach_viewer is available from hydro-devel branch of ros-visualization. you may have to install the ros-hydro-xdot package if you are using Ubuntu 12.04.
Alternatives would be interesting of course and if someone knows of one or two I would like to read and learn about them.
