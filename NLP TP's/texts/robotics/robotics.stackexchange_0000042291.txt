Q:

publish range data from android app

Hi,
I am trying to publish range data (Fake) from Android application to the PC.

I have successfully written a rosjava package rosjava_range which is nothing but a publisher and subscriber of the message type "sensor_msgs.Range._TYPE".

As per instruction I created my new application by copying android_tutorial_pubsub.

I tried to modify the build.gradle file to add my own package (class)

dependencies {
compile 'ros.rosjava_core:rosjava_tutorial_pubsub:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
compile 'ros.rosjava_core:rosjava_range:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
}

And then made changes in the MainActivity.java file to import the following class.

import org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker;
import org.ros.rosjava_range.Range_Talker;
I was not able to build successfully. I get the following error:
-post-package:
-do-debug:
[echo] Library project: do not create apk...

-post-build:
debug:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second
:android_tutorial_range:deployLibs
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':android_tutorial_range:compile'.

Could not find group:org.ros.rosjava_range, module:rosjava_range, version:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
Required by:
ros.android_core:android_tutorial_range:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED
Total time: 2.453 secs
What am I missing here? Do I have to add the path to my rosjava_range package?
Thanks for the help.

A:

The solution was very simple. Instead of linking it from another package you have to add those files in the src folder and make sure that you import it ( import org.ros.rosjava_range.Range_Talker; ) in the MainActivity.java file.
