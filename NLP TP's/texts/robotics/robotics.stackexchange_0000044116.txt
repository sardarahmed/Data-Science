Q:

Inmediate inicialization of ROS when turning on the robot

Hello community,
I want to build a Quadrotor robot with an IntensePC on it so I it can be programmed with ROS in order to perform autonomous navigation etc. The thing is that I want that robot to initialize inmediatly without starting ubuntu etc. like when you turn on a cellphone or an old fashined nintendo console, you push the ON button and in a few seconds it is up and running the main program.
Is it possible to do this with ROS?
and if yes. How can I do it?
Thank you all!!

A:

I designed the package ros_comm_upstart specifically for this goal.
It wraps roscore as a service that can be launched at startup.
It is available as a Debian package for ROS Electric. It would not be difficult to adapt this work for Fuerte.
It is also possible to adapt this work to make it launch a ROS launch file at start-up.
