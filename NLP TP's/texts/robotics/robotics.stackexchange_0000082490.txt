Q:

Rosdep not finding packages that are in index.yaml

I am have ros-kinetic installed in Ubuntu 16.04. I cloned a couple of packages into my workspace and ran rosdep to get their dependencies. I ran rosdep from the root of my workspace using this line
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO} -y --as-root pip:no --skip-keys="gazebo"

Rosdep returns with a bunch of missing pacakages. The missing packages in my case are listed below.

dpkg-query: no packages found matching ros-kinetic-map-server

Most of these packages are found in the ros distro index file. I am able to install them manually using apt-get. Why is rosdep failing to find them?

Is that the full output from rosdep? I usually get a string of dpkg-query like that, and then rosdep installs all of the packages.

That was the problem. I had misspelled a different package that prevented rosdep from continuing and installing more stuff. I knew about the misspelled package but didn't realize that was causing other packages from being installed. Thanks for your suggestion. That fixed it.

A:

In case some package is mispelled or if there is some other reason preventing rosdep from installing some package. That could also prevent if from installing some valid packages in the list. Fixing other errors that rosdep detected fixed this problem.
