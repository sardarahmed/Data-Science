Q:

Tango_Ros_Streamer record data?

I want to record data from Tango with Tango Ros Streamer and save them into a bag by command: rosbag record -a
When i visualize sequence of image in this bag, i realize the frame rate is extremely slow. Do you have any idea to modify or fix frame rate with this application?

A:

Looking at the documentation for tango_ros_streamer, I see that it outputs a lot of data, including some high-bandwidth topics like point clouds and images. When you are recording all of the ROS messages with rosbag record -a, you may be recording data faster than your hard drive can store it, causing rosbag record to drop messages. There are a few ways you could solve that problem:

If you don't need all of the data (you only mention looking at the images), you can specify only those topics to record.
If you're recording to a platter hard drive, you could try switching to a solid state drive.
You might also be able to improve recording performance by increasing the buffer size. For example, rosbag record -a --buffersize=1024 quadruples the message buffer during recording. For more information, see the rosbag command line documentation.
