Q:

OS X Install â€“ Problems With PIL

I'm trying to install Hydro on a fresh OS X Mavericks system, but I get hung up during the following command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y

The issue I'm getting is with PIL: Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement PIL. When I try to install PIL manually (using sudo pip install -U PIL --allow-external PIL --allow-unverified PIL), I get stuck at _imagingft.c:73:10: fatal error: 'freetype/fterrors.h' file not found, even though freetype is installed and up to date.
Has anyone else experienced the same issue?

Note that if you later decide to install ogre with brew install ogre, you might need to remove that symlink again for it to compile (at least when I did this a while back it was neccessary).
