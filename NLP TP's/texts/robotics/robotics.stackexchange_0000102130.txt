Q:

[nav2] How to trigger the nav2 BT navigator from another node?

I know that the BT navigator starts going to work when a topic is being published to, but I want to feed the algorithm a pre-made path. If I call the FollowPath action server directly, will the BT navigator use the behavior tree to navigate? Otherwise, what's the proper way for an outside node to send a navigation mission to the nav2 system without asking the system to compute a path?

A:

Create your own behavior tree with your custom application logic, bypassing the components you don't need and/or replacing them with custom BT nodes for what you want to do.

Yes, that seems like the solution. Feedback: Say I do. Then, to trigger ticking the root of the BT, I call the navigate_to_pose action client with an empty goal, after which it will tick the root and can proceed loading behaviors I need. It would be nice to trigger the tick without going for an empty action goal on an action server called navigate_to_pose, when my BT is not exactly about navigating to pose.
