Q:

Error while using ROSMAKE

ROS_FUERTE
UBUNTU 10.04
I have followed these instructions.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/gpsd_client/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20gpsd_client
I have installed the gps_umd package and the ros_package_path is also set properly as just roscd gps_umd takes me to the directory.
when I typed
sudo rosmake --rosdep-install
results in
sudo: rosmake: command not found
and when I type
rosmake gpsd_client
results in
  mkdir -p bin
  cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
  Segmentation fault

Please let me know how I can use this stack for my project.
Thanks,
Sai

Please edit your post and provide the following information: which ros distro are you using, which ubuntu version and what's the output echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?

A:

I just restarted the system and typed
roscd gpsd_client
and
rosmake gpsd_client
it WORKED !!!

You had probably forgotten to source the setup.bash script, but remembered to include it in your bash profile.
