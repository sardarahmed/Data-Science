Q:

PR2 hydro tuckarms

I'm just testing the pr2 simulation in hydro and I noticed that I cannot even do tuckarms. Is this normal? something changed in the way you do tuckarms now?

Can you be more specific about the error you encounter when trying to use tuckarms in Hydro?
Comment by silgon on 2014-06-29:
It's just that in groovy there is the folder =/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/pr2_common_actions/pr2_tuck_arms_action= and not in hydro. So I cannot do the tuckarms

A:

Missing a particular folder just indicates that you don't have the corresponding package installed.
I think the bigger issue here is that the pr2_tuckarm package probably isn't released for Hydro. See http://answers.ros.org/question/178864/how-to-run-tuckarm-on-hydro/
