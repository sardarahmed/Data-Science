Q:

errors installing orocos_toolchain_ros on electric

Hi,
I'm trying to install orocos_toolchain_ros on electric release following the instructions on your web page:
sudo aptitude install ros-electric-orocos-toolchain ros-electric-rtt-ros-integration ros-electric-rtt-ros-comm ros-electric-rtt-common-msgs ros-electric-rtt-geometry
and the first error that I find is that the ros-electric
-rtt-geometry package can't be found.
If I follow with the instructions avoiding this package, when I'm trying to do:
sudo git clone http://git.mech.kuleuven.be/robotics/rtt_ros_integration.git
I get the following errors:
error: inflate: data stream error (incorrect header check)
error: File 318458b05854f9a89b044e010a1738351bd6244a (http://git.mech.kuleuven.be/robotics/rtt_ros_integration.git/objects/a8/18ccadb911aa86a9120d25981d64abf102dd30) corrupt

A:

After running "sudo apt-get update" first, I can successfully install the Ubuntu packages running " sudo aptitude install ros-electric-orocos-toolchain ros-electric-rtt-ros-integration ros-electric-rtt-ros-comm ros-electric-rtt-common-msgs ros-electric-rtt-geometry"
However, I still can't install orocos_toolchain_ros from source using "sudo git clone http://git.mech.kuleuven.be/robotics/rtt_ros_integration.git"
Any idea ...?

Can you describe the problem in more detail? The 'data stream error' makes the git repository not check out correctly? Is it empty, or only partially there? Do you get any other error messages from git?

I have the same problem when trying to install orocos_toolchain_ros from source.  The best thing to do is to file a ticket on bugs.orocos.org.
