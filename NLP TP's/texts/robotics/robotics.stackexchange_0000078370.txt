Q:

How to define actuators in URDF exporter?

Hi!
I have an assembly that looks like this: 
Now this doesn't have joints but does have 6 actuators. I have to use sw2urdf exporter to use the mesh in Gazebo Sim so that I can define the thrusters as actuators in the simulator. I am not able to understand what are joints and what are links in this assembly. Please help me out, a little hint would be sufficient.
Thanks for making this tool. Really appreciate it.

Your image is not showing. Please attach it directly to your question. I've given you enough karma to do that.

Just added it. Thanks for suggesting

A:

If you are talking about the actuator elements inside transmissions, then you can't add those using the sw2urdf plugin.
You'll have to do that manually, by editing the urdf after exporting it.

Thanks for your answer. I have noted this. Can you please have a look again at the question? I have added the image now.

I'm not sure I would change my answer. The exporter derives joint locations by looking at SW mates, which I don't think you have. Also: joints probably don't make much sense here. If you're just after having a mesh for Gazebo then you can just export without any joints defined.
