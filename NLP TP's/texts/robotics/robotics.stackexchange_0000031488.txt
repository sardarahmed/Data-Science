Q:

openni_kinect on squeeze

Hi,
I installed ROS on squeeze via easy_install and it was done
successfully.
Then I tried to openni_kinect as described in
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect.
but as I performed
rosmake openni_kinect --rosdep-install
then I got errors as below. Pls share if someone has idea what is the problem and how to make this works.
Thanks in advanced.

A:

We don't have the openni drivers packaged as binary debs for squeeze.  The easiest way to get them is to check them out from the mercurial repo at https://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers and make && make install from there.
