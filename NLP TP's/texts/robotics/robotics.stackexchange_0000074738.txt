Q:

how to judge move_base has go to the goal?

We can control the robot to a goal, using base_move and amcl.
but i can not judge that when the robot reached the goal.
I think, we can judge the vel or the tf not change to do it .
but, I think that ,it must have better solution.
I use rqt_graph and rosrun tf view_frames list all.
but , I can not find any solution than I do.
anyone can help me to solve it,
thanks!
EDIT1:
when the route is short the status always be 3 , when the robot nav to a long distance the status change to 1 and then change to 3.
I want to know why , the status is not change the status 3 SUCCEEDED->1ACTIVE->3 SUCCEEDED ?

A:

you can check the topic move_base/status (more info).
answering EDIT 1:
you probably see the status as 3 (SUCCEEDED) for short paths because move_base "thinks" it already arrived at the goal position, probably because the goal is inside the tolerance.
for longer paths, it should first be 1 (ACTIVE) and then 3 (SUCCEEDED).

Note though, that this only works if you use the action interface. If you use the move_base_simple/goal topic interface (which you do if you set the goal in rviz) this will not work.
But in the end, the only way to do it is to use the action interface, so @Procopio is right.
