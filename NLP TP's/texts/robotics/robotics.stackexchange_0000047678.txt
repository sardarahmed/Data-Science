Q:

USB Graphics Card for Ubuntu 12.04LTS

Does anyone know about a USB Graphics card that has drivers that function in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS? The graphics card on my PC does not support multi-display functionality in Ubuntu OR RViz feeds from the kinect sensor...
Any suggestions on a good USB graphics card with Linux drivers?
Thanks!
Andy

What devices is your PC made of?

A:

Andy, a USB graphics adapter is a waste of money. Why don't you tell everyone what your ROS project is, then they can help you better? You don't mention if it must be a laptop, or battery operated?
The easiest path is to get yourself a spare desktop PC (can be second hand) with a nice NVidia graphics card. Setup a fresh Ubuntu install and you'll be set.
