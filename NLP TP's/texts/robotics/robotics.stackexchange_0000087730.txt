Q:

Orbbec Astra Mini S - Depth calibration

I can calibrate the rgb image, but i don't get how it is possible to calibrate the depth image / depth cloud. Some help would be very nice :)

Well, for Kinects subscription to ir is used. The following is for old camera_calibration module and a chess board
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py image:=/camera/ir/image_raw camera:=/camera/ir --size 8x6 --square 0.1

This calibration method is working for me for:
image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw camera:=/camera/rgb
However if i use the ir/image_raw the windows that opens freezes, and is unresponsive.
I tried image:=/camera/depth/image_raw camera:=/camera/depth but with this i only get a b&w depth image.

Well, I just followed the same procedure as with rgb and it worked

A:

Solved it!
Looks like my camera doesn't publish in the topic /camera/ir/image_raw, it publishes it in /camera/ir/image.
Now i can calibrate the camera.
