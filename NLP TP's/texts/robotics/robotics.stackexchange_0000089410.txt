Q:

How to disable moveit octomap

Hi all,
When i launch move_group.launch as generated by the moveit setup assistant I get the error that no sensor plugin is specified for the octomap updater. How can I disable the octomap updater entirely? Because I dont have any sensor and am not interested in using the octomap at all.

A:

You can safely ignore that, it doesn't influence anything.

Issue here: ros-planning/moveit#1680.

If it can be safely ignored, it shouldn't have ERROR severity.
In fact, there should be a way to completely disable this feature, so it doesn't spam the terminal with unwanted messages that make debugging harder.
