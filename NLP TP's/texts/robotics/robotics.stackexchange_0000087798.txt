Q:

Ubuntu 16.04 deb packages for ROS2 Bouncy Bolson?

Right now there are no deb packages for Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) (ros2 wiki ROS2 Bouncy Bolson Release Notes). Will there be some in the future?

A:

As the referenced release page says there are only Debian packages for Ubuntu Bionic. No, there won't be any Debian packages for Ubuntu Xenial.
