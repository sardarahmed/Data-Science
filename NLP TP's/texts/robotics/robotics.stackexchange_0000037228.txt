rviz starts with ubuntu higher versions,but i don't like that.Want to use 10.04

here the terminal output :
auto-starting new master
process[master]: started with pid [16798]
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
setting /run_id to 1e62e032-4512-11e1-9e45-90004e158d56

process[robot_state_publisher-2]: started with pid [16824]
process[rviz-3]: started with pid [16827]
The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'.
(Details: serial 22 error_code 9 request_code 136 minor_code 3)
(Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
[rviz-3] process has died [pid 16827, exit code 1].

What kind of graphics card do you have? Which driver are you using for it (if there are restricted drivers available)?

A:

This sounds similar to this question. Try the troubleshooting steps linked there.
Generally, this "BadDrawable" error is related to either your GPU being too old to run rviz or a problem with the driver. Since you say it starts okay on newer versions of Ubuntu, my guess would be that the driver for your GPU included in the kernel used in 10.04 has a bug that was fixed in newer versions of Ubuntu.
