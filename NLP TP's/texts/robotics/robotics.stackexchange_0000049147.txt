Failed to open port /dev/ttyUSB0.  Please make sure the Create cable is plugged into the computer.

A:

There is a set of instructions you need to follow:
1.Check that initially no USB is connected to the system
2.First USB connected to your system should be Turtlebot cable, which will occupy the ttyUSB0 position
3.'After reading your above problem', you need to provide root rights to your USB0 port, using the command "sudo chmod 0777 /dev/ttyUSB0"
4.Now run roscore and check if the problem still exists.
