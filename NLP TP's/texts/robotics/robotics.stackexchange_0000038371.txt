Q:

Controlling workstation-pc with commands issued by Turtlebot

Dear all,
I am currently working on an application, where I want to enable/disable signals via ROS workstation's pc serial or USB port.
I currently issue vocal commands to Turtlebot like 'enable Output #1' or 'enable Output #2'.
I want to interpret these commands into signal toggles at the ROS workstation-pc serial port.
Can you please point me to the right direction, since I cannot source any similar applications online.
Thanks.

I have an Arduino board connected to the ros-workstation-pc usb port. From the other side there is a ros-turtlebot-pc which is able to interpret voice commands. I would like to issue a vocal command to turtlebot-pc, to signal a toggle from ros-turtlebot-pc to the ros-workstation-pc usb port.

A:

A vocal command you was looking for has been developed by NICT. Could you check it out on this web( http://rospeex.org/top/ ) ? The tool is called rospeex.
