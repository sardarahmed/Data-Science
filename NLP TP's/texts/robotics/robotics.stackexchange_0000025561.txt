Q:

Modelling of sensor noise

Hi all,
I'm quite used to Gazebo in ROS Electric. In URDF, there is possibility to set desired level of Gaussian noise for laser scanner and IMU, distortion for camera etc. I went through specification of SDF and there are no such elements... So I'm wondering if it's going to be specified later or never. Thanks in advance.

Hey, did you find a way to implement a noise model? I am simulating kinect in gazebo and am looking for a noise model that matches the actual kinect hardware. Thanks!

A:

Sensor noise models are planned to be released sometime before this year is out. We highly encourage you to take a stab at this.

Actually, I'm quite interested in modelling sensor noise and errors as it's part of my research for PhD. thesis. I've already implemented some basic noise model for Kinect depth measurement.

Is there any SIG (or something like this) for this kind of functionality?
