Q:

How to tell the robot to go to a location on the map

http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/SendingSimpleGoals
This tutorial shows how to tell the robot to move forward. However, if I want to let this robot move to a certain coordinate on the map what should I do? I tried to minus the target location (hardcore it) with the current location(got from /odom) and send this to navigation stack, but it for reason unknown to me does work well.
Thanks!

This would be easier to answer if you posted your attempted solution (code).

A:

I think sendingSimpleGoals would help, you can add your goals with certain coordiante and send the goal after one is complete
