Q:

Rosbag as a workspace

Hey,
I'm creating a rosbag and want to record two topics into a .bag file. I am using a Python script to create this. The problem being is that I don't know whether or not I need to create a workspace, so then I could have the following command: rosrun project bag which would then record the topics or just have a script that I can run from terminal manually?
Thanks

A:

Hello,
use the command tool rosbag record -a to record in a bag file.
See:

If you really need the API for python, see:
http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Code%20API where read and write from python to a bag file are detailled.
