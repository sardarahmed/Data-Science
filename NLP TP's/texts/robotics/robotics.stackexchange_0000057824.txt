Q:

Error in Arduino-ROS connection

Hello to all!
A few months ago, I connected Arduino to ROS fuerte using rosserial without problems. However, now I'm trying to reproduce it in ROS groovy and I always get the same error.
I am working with Ubuntu 12.04, ROS Groovy, Arduino 1.0.5, rosserial-groovy-devel and both Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega.
I do these commands:
Window 1:
sudo ./Arduino/arduino
Open Hello World example.
Select Controller Arduino Uno/Mega.
Select Serial Port /dev/ttyACM0.
Load code.
Window 2:
roscore
Window 3:
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
And I get this error:
[INFO] [WallTime: 1394533587.406466] ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [WallTime: 1394533587.419060] Connecting to /dev/ttyACM0 at 57600 baud
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1394533590.332723] Creation of publisher failed: unpack requires a string argument of length 4
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1394533591.328157] Tried to publish before configured, topic id 125
Anyone can help me?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Try removing and remaking your ros_lib.
