Q:

reading parameter in c

Hello,
I am trying to read parameters in my program based on this example  http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server
Here is code snippet
std::string my_number;
nh_.getParam("my_number",my_number);

ROS_INFO("\n My Number %s",my_number.c_str());

And  I am calling like this
rosrun mypkg my_node my_number:=5
This value is not getting read.
Please help, how can  I read in my C program.
Thanks,
Hemant

A:

my_number:=5 does NOT set a parameter. It remaps the topic my_number to 5.
Either set the parameter on the param server, e.g., via rosparam set or use _my_number:=5 to set a private parameter. In that case you'll also need a private NodeHandle("~") before retrieving the parameter.
