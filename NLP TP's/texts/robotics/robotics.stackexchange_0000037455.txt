Q:

dynamic reconfigure changes at runtime

The established way to use dynamic_reconfigure is through a .cfg file which cmake then will use to generate relevant .py scripts.
However, I have a device which can have different items to adjust which will be known at first runtime, but not consistently the same between uses. Is there a way to generate a Config class dynamically at runtime rather than through a saved .cfg script?
