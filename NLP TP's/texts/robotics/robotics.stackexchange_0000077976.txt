A:

I do not see why this should not work from MoveIt's point of view.
The stop-request is forwarded to the FollowJointTrajectory action-server that executes the trajectory.
Whether this action server then aborts the trajectory is up to him.
I seem to recall that ros-control based systems will still try to execute the rest of the trajectory even if they are asked to abort.
So what implements your FollowJointTrajectory action server?
