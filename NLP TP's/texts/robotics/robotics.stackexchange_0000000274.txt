Q:

Low-cost servo with digital control interfaces?

Some years ago, there where some projects that provided hardware and software to perform modifications on standard hobby servos to convert them to digital servos, with all the advantages that come with it. 

OpenServo is a little outdated, and does not seem to be worked on anymore, and there is no hardware to buy.
Sparkfun has its own version of the OpenServo, which at least is available for buying.

Do you know if there are other mods, or even complete low cost digital servos? I am mostly interested in position feedback, and servo chaining.

A:

Yes, the v3 OpenServo is out of stock.
In fact we are working on a new version 4 of OpenServo that will modernise the codebase.
There are no timelines for the v4 as yet, but work has only just started.
I would recommend the SparkFun board for now.
