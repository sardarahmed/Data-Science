Q:

Unable to load the manifest for package 

Hey everyone.
I walked through the tutorials and created a custom message called "Person.msg" under a project named "testing". I can see the message and its definition using "rosmsg show". I can also publish data using the message definition and with a subscriber see the data being published.
So with that said, here is my issue. I have a rosbridge server running and have had success connecting, advertising, publishing, and subscribing to preexisting message types (ex: std_msgs/String). However, when I try to simply subscribe to my custom message type, I get an error displayed in rosbridge which states:
"subscribe: Unable to load the manifest for package testing. Caused by: testing"
My manifest file in the testing package is as follows
<package>
  <description brief="testing">

        testing
  </description>
  <author>James</author>
  <license>BSD</license>
  <review status="unreviewed" notes=""/>
  <url>"couldnt post the url..."</url>
  <depend package="std_msgs"/>
  <depend package="rospy"/>
  <depend package="roscpp"/> </package>

Anyone have any suggestions on what I am doing wrong? Thanks!

Ok. No harm no foul. Looks like I just needed to close out the rosbridge terminal window and restart it. I guess it was having trouble "seeing" the new project..
