Q:

Arm always in collision when running get_state_validity

While running the Checking State Validity tutorial the robot arm is always red (except when joint limits are violated), even when there should be no collisions. After some debugging effort, I found that head_pan_link+double_stereo_link were always in collision. Otherwise, the tutorial seems to work in that the arm turns blue when joint limits are violated and collision markers appear where they should.

A:

Thanks for the report - it looks like the positions of some of the links subtly changed in the latest release of pr2_description and that we need a slightly altered set of collision operations in pr2_arm_navigation.  I'll do a release this week, but in the meantime if you add the following line to get_state_validity.cpp at line 33 things should work (this line just disables all collisions except those that matter for the arm):
collision_models.disableCollisionsForNonUpdatedLinks("right_arm");

Thank you, adding the line worked.
