A:

You can make it out of several small segments, for example:
 <road name="my_road">
   <width>7.34</width>
   <point>0 0 0</point>
   <point>5 2 0</point>
   <point>8 5 0</point>
   <point>10 10 0</point>
 </road>

Alright, thank you very much. Now I understood. Is there any way to define curvature to give a smooth curve?
Comment by chapulina on 2018-06-15:
I don't think so, you can try to increase the resolution by placing more points close to each other.

Okay, thank you very much. I will write code in MATLAB to generate a set of points defining a curvature and use them in SDF file.

Does this apply to ign too? I tried that and it isn't showing up on my end
