Q:

RGBD slam on groovy

I want to run the rgbd slam package provided on open slam website with ROS groovy. The readme file with the package has instructions for diamondback.
I have downloaded the package along with the hogman_minimal library.
I have also edited the manifest.xml file adding  for openni dependency. But now when I run rosdep install rgbdsalm_freiburg, I get error:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource rgbdsalm_freiburg
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

I am sure my RGBD slam package is in the $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable because when I do
roscd rgbdslam, I am able to change my directory to rgbdslam folder.
How can I make it work?
