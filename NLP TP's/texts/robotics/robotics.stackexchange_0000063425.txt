Q:

Indigo on Gumstix Overo?

Has anybody installed ROS Indigo on Gumstix Overo (by installing Ubuntu 14.04)? Previously I have installed an older Ubuntu version using Linaro and then installed ROS. But I cannot find a good starting point for Ubuntu 14.04. Does anybody have a working description of how to do it?

Do you mean the source install?

I think he's looking for instructions for installing Ubuntu 14.04 on the Gumstix, since it's required to install ROS Indigo.

My apologies.  That does seem like what he means.

Yes, instructions or a pointer to what to start with... I suppose I can always upgrade from 12.04 Linaro but it takes so much time and  suppose that there is no guarantee that the kernel works for 14.04.  But it is now unclear if we need Indigo on Gumstix Overo so I will wait until it is needed.
