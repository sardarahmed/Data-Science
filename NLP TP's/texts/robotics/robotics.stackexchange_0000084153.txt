Q:

tf broadcaster too slow for lookupTransform

Hey,
i create a frame and publish it once with broadcaster. after the broadcaster-call I do a lookupTransform. The problem. i am getting not the lookup to the last information i have broadcasted. For me the broadcaster is too slow.
Is there a possibility to transform two frames directly without broadcasting ? or should i set the buffer time very low?
regards

A:

If you don't care about other nodes being able to access the transforms take a look at BufferCore, which allows offline transforms with a similar interface to tf #q258116
