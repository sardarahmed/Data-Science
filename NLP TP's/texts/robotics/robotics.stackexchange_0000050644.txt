Q:

Limit Scan Angle for LMS100

Hi,
I am using the LMS1xx driver package for the LMS100 I have. The scan angle of the laser is 270 degrees. I want to reduce the scan angle of LMS100 to less than 180 degrees. Can the laser filter package do it? Or can it be done from the LMS1xx package itself?

This seems to be a common question. :)
If you dont want to alter the laser driver, you can use the laser_filters package as you already guessed.
Example of how to use this:
<launch>
  <node pkg="laser_filters" type="scan_to_scan_filter_chain"
      name="laser_filter">
    <rosparam command="load" file="laserscan_filter.yaml" />
  </node>
</launch>

With laserscan_filter.yaml containing:
scan_filter_chain:
- name: laser_cutoff
  type: laser_filters/LaserScanAngularBoundsFilter
  params:
    lower_angle: -1.60876090527
    upper_angle: 1.60876090527

Hey, thanks for your answer. It is working. But I couldn't find this plugin in the original documentation. Are there any other set of filters which are not mentioned?
