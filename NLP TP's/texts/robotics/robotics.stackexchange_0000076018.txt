Q:

How to feed physical dimensions of robot to navigation stack?

I have just successfully finished my simulation and just assembled my robot hardware. Now i want to setup navigation stack in my real robot.
In the simulation, the navigation stack will take the dimensions of robot (Base L x W x H, wheel dia, Wheel separation) from the spawned URDF file but how and where should i feed these details to navigations stack in the real robot.

A:

First of all, the URDF file is not only used by simulator(e.g. Gazebo), but also used by RViz, which can display a robot model after reading the URDF file.
As for navigation stack, the URDF file doesn't affect the navigation. The local and global planner are setup by several configuration files(costmap_common_params.yaml, global_costmap_params.yaml, local_costmap_params.yaml and base_local_planner_params.yaml). The robot footprint is setup in the costmap_common_params.yaml.
For more details, you can see navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup.

EDIT
It is not necessary to spawn the URDF, it doesn't affect the navigation. RViz can display a robot outline according to the parameters(footprint or robot_radius) in costmap_common_params.yaml. But with URDF, RViz can also display a good-looking robot model. It just for good-looking.

So, should i spawn the URDF file while experimenting ROS navigation in real robot also?

how can I get the footprint of a robot model build with meshes ??
