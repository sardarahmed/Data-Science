A:

This error message says that the xdot, convex_decomposition and moveit_resources packages are missing. I suspect there are other packages that are missing too.
Since you're using ROS on Ubuntu, you can install all of the dependencies that are required by your workspace by using rosdep:
cd ~/catkin_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src -i

This should install xdot, convex_decomposition and moveit_resources via apt-get.
