Q:

latched topic and rviz

Hello,
I have some constant data published as MarkerArray topics so it can be seen in rviz.
Instead of streaming constant data, I thought it would be much more optimal to use latched topics to publish the data once and sending it when it is needed.
However, it does not work that well: in rviz, the first time the marker is rendered it is ok, but if the rendering stops for some reason (i.e. I restart the demo and some tf frames are temporarily not available for instance), it is not displayed anymore.
Is this a bug? What would be the best strategy in order to keep a consistent display?
Thanks!
