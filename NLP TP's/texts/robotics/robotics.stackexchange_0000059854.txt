Q:

rviz crashes at startup for universal robot

I have installed the hydro-devel-c-api branch of the universal_robot package from the ros-industrial github and am attempting to run the demonstration commands from the readme file. The python demonstration runs fine and controls the UR5 well. However, when I use the roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=false robot_ip:=IP_OF_THE_ROBOT command (with the proper ip address there), rviz begins to start, and then crashes. This is the terminal output from this command: pastebin.com/wTUu5xQN.

A:

This may be related to the problem described in Does anyone have a ur5 working with moveit and hydro?, and in particular to this comment:

It would seem the UR5 MoveIt cfg uses a set of links, instead of a single chain, which is different from other ROS-I cfgs. I'm not sure why it is setup like that, there might be a valid reason.

As far as I know (and as @sedwards explained on the mailinglist), the hydro-devel-c-api branch hasn't been updated with the regenerated MoveIt configurations, which could explain why you are still seeing that crash.
A related bug report on the universal_robot github repository: 41: rviz crashes when trying to launch ur5_moveit_config in hydro.
