Q:

What revision of C is targeted by ROS 2?

REP-2000  is stating that ROS 2 is targeting C++14. What about C? Is it a safe assume that all packages are compiled against C11?

A:

Yes, we use / need C11. I updated the REP accordingly: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/189

Windows doesn't implement C11 (and I don't think they intend to do so).
Comment by Thomas on 2019-02-14:
Awesome! Indeed the reason I was asking this is due to Windows related build issues.
Comment by William on 2019-02-14:
@Thomas I'd be interested to know what issues you've been having, since I've dealt with a few over the past few years related to C11 and Windows.

@William the PR is here: https://github.com/ros2/rcl/pull/332 (strncpy_s / strncpy incompatibility) - seems like we finally went with memcopy.
