Q:

install rqt on fuerte from source, Help

Hello,
As a begginer, im having some problems with ros operating. Im trying to install rqt on raspi with fuerte from source. Im following this instructions
Build from source
Clone the git repositories qt_gui_core and rqt
Checkout the branch fuerte-devel for both repositories
Compile via rosmake rqt
But i cant manage to finally install it, i get some errors and i que dont really know how to execute each step. Could anyone give me some more concrete instructions to get it right?
Thanks a lot

A:

JS's comment looks like it might work too.
But at the bottom of this page http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/UserGuide/Install/Groovy
Inexplicably there are fuerte instructions to build from source.
It looks like the fuerte instructions were merged into the groovy page at some point...
Do those work for you?
