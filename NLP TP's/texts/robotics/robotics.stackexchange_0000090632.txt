Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-industrial-core

Hello!
I'm trying to control an ABB IRB120 with ROS. For that matter, I want to install ROS-industrial.
I am following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Install but when executing "sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-industrial-core", the message "E: Unable to locate package ros-melodic-industrial-core" appears. It looks like the industrial core packages are not supported for ROS Melodic.
Will I have to install this package from a not-fully-supported source? or something like that? I am new to ROS. Any help is appreciated.
I'm using the ROS Melodic Morenia distribution with Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.
Kind regards.

A:

industrial_core (and all the packages in that repository) were released into Melodic and with the sync out are now available to install with apt on supported OS.

wow! those are great news! thank you for the answer.
After doing some readings I have finally managed to get it going, working with the RViz and connecting to the RobotStudio environment.

Hi ahmed ali! of course. I know how frustrating it was for me as a ROS Beginner, to have these things installed and correctly running. I managed to document all the steps I followed. Here is the document that will help you on this task.

+100 for sharing your document, but as I wrote in my answer, sudo apt install ros-melodic-industrial-core should just work, as the package has been released. Building from source is not necessary.
See status_page/ros_melodic_default.html?q=industrial_core.
Same for ABB. Only abb_experimental needs to be built from source, as it is an experimental repository and does not get released.

Yes! I forgot to mention that, ahmed ali... However that is also included in the document. There is an "UPDATE" part which explains about this. Please read the whole document before installing something.

There is an "UPDATE" part which explains about this

you may want to move that update to the start of the document. It's "hidden" somewhere quite far down. Users which are used to copy-paste their way through instructions will have executed about 60% of the instructions before they get to that update.
