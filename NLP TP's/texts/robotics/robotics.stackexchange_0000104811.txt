Q:

How to use stereo_image_proc without camera_info topics?

I'm working with 2 csi cameras in a jetson nano with ROS2 humble and I want to do a disparity image. What I'm trying to use is stereo_image_proc disparity node, but it requires to have the camera_info topics for both of the cameras. The camera is a imx219-83 and I haven't found a driver that allows me to have a camera_info topic. Is it possible to obtain this topic ? If not, is there something that could be helpful for this situations?
Thanks!

A:

This tutorial does exactly what you want, I think. They are also creating a disparity map with stereo_image_proc.
There you will calibrate your cameras and use the opencv_cam driver to read your devices. When reading you cameras with opencv_cam you can provide a calibration file (.yaml) that you created with the calibration, and open_cv cam will publish your image_raw and camera_info topic.
