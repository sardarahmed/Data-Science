Q:

How to run roscore and then run a package on system startup.?

Hi guys.
I am new to ROS. I wan to run following on the system start up:

Roscore
ROS Package
ROS bag record.

Although i have searched on google and many people have answered this already, but i couldnt understand it, so if any one could help me in a kindergarten teacher way..
Also any suggestion for a good book/blog etc related to linux and ROS, for dummies and new comers like me...
Your help would be really appreciated.

You might want to split this into two questions since they are independent of one another.

A:

You can use robot_upstart to generate a "service" that will run a launch file. Within the launch file you may include your node(s), parameters, bag, etc.
The first step is to get a launch file which does everything you want. Do that before attempting to use robot_upstart and it will dramatically reduce debugging any issues you may have.

Is this still working on 16.04 with systemd?

Yes. I am using it with Ubuntu 16.04 on Raspberry Pi for the LoCoRo project.
