Q:

update_frequency vs publish_frequency (costmap parameters)

I have a costmap_common.yaml file which has update_frequency and publish_frequency parameters.
What is the significance of these parameters? I looked up costmap_2d wiki and found the following -
update_frequency - The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.
publish_frequency - The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information.
What does map in the above definitions refer to? Do they refer to the costmap (global or local) or do they refer to the /map topic?

the costmap for which the parameters are set.

What's the difference between update_frequency and publish_frequency ?

A:

Going over to an answer now, instead of comments.
update_frequency and publish_frequency refer to the costmap for which the parameters are set.
As specified in the wiki, and as you cite yourself:

update_frequency is how fast the costmap should be updated. I.e. how often new sensor data is integrated.
publish_frequency is how fast the costmap is published.

note that for some applications (like move_base, e.g.) the costmap does not need to be published at all. As move_base accesses it via the API, publishing the costmap is only for visualization purposes. This is why there are two parameters, leaving you the choice to publish it, or not; publish it with very low frequency but integrate sensor data faster, or whatever you prefer.
