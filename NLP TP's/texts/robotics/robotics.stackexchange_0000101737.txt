Q:

I keep getting this error while running navigation with robot_pose_ekf package

Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to odom to become available before running costmap, tf error: Could not find a connection between 'odom' and 'base_link' because they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnected trees.. canTransform returned after 0.100956 timeout was 0.1.
I use robot_pose_ekf package to transform odom -> basefootprint but i don know why the transform doesn't work
this is my TF tree

A:

This may not help you exactly, but just to check:

is the input frame correctly set to base_link (the default is base_footprint)
and is the output frame correctly set to odom (the default is odom_combined):

From the tf graph it seems like robot_pose_ekf is not doing the job of transforming odom to base_footprint. This could be due to parameter errors (as suggested above) or a lack of 'proper' information being fed into the odom
