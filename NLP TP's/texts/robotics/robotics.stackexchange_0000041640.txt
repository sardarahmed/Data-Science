Q:

R.O.S installation on Beaglebone without internet access

I have a BeagleBone that already has Ubuntu running on it.  I want to install R.O.S on it but it can't connect to the internet for some reason.  I wanted to know if there was a way to put all of the R.O.S files into a flash drive that I could use to install it on the Beaglebone or if there was a way to copy the R.O.S that's running on my P.C and transfer it to the Beaglebone and if so, how?

My favourite tool for this is apt-offline, as explained in this post: ROS offline installation.
