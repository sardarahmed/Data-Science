Q:

Is there a service call for getting the total inertia of a robot in Gazebo

Hello, I am working with gazebo and I have a model of a robot. I would like to know its total inertia. The robot is made by fixed link only so the inertia should always be the same. I tried looking for some kind of rosservice (like /gazebo/get_model_state) but couldn't find anything.
thanks for your help!
