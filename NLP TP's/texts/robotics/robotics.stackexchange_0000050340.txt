Q:

How to set up OpenCV(which is part of ROS) in Qt creator in Ubuntu12.04

I have OpenCV2.4.2 installed as part of ROS(Fuerte) in my computer. I want to use an IDE for my projects, I already have installed Qt creator from Ubuntu Software center.
Is it possible to use ROS opencv in an IDE and work. If yes,can somebody help me with how to set up/configure Qt creator with the ROS opencv ?
Thank you

Hi!
Here is a little trick that I used (if anyone knows a "cleaner" way to do this, please let us know):
1- Create a symbolic link to /opt/ros/fuerte/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc inside the directory /user/local/lib/pkgconfig.
cd /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
ln -s /opt/ros/fuerte/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc opencv.pc

2- Create the appropriate .pro file for your Qt project
TARGET= MyQtProject
TEMPLATE = APP

SOURCES += main.cpp

CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
PKGCONFIG += opencv

If the file /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc already exists you can copy ROS's file with another name, for instance: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv_fuerte.pc and then use PKGCONFIG += opencv_fuerte

Thank you for the answer....but when I do cd /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig , I get bash: cd: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig: No such file or directory .... am I supposed to create a new directory there ??

Yes, if it does not exist you should create it. Remember to do it as root (sudo)

I did exactly as you said... earlier when I tried to run the program it would say opencv2/opencv.hpp : No such file or directory... Now it s fine but doesnt display the output image... a terminal opens and stays as such... nothing happens......

Do i need to take care of some other settings in Qt creator such as build/Release configuration, etc this is the progam (http://i.imgur.com/tD8nWzY.png) I tried and .pro file (http://i.imgur.com/sprITVF.png)

I tested your code, when I launch it from within Qt environment (using the green "Play" button) a terminal appears and nothing else happens, as you mentioned.But, if I execute the program from a console (find the folder where the project is built and execute ./Hello_World), then it works!

Thank u.....yes it works fine if I do as u said.....Am I supposed to always do this way??? The motive of going for an IDE is quicker access through the GUI...am I right? Any idea where I might hav missed some setting or something ?? did you get any similar problem??

Finally I got it working... I changed some settings in Qt creator.... In Projects tab -> Run settings -> unselect Run in terminal option... Now the code works as I click the green "Play" button !
