Q:

Weird rqt_graph when running turtlesim

I am going through the ROS tutorials and on the "Understanding Topics" tutorial in section 1.2.1 when I launch rqt_graph I get this image:

It should be this:
image description http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=rqt_graph_turtle_key.png(according to the tutorial)
my_turtle was from the previous tutorial and I tried killing it with rosnode kill /my_turtle but when I restarted rqt_graph it didn't change. Any ideas as to why this is happening? Also why are there three turtlesim nodes besides the my_turtle node, instead of two?

A:

but your rosnode kill /my_turtle does not match your _my_turtle with underscore in the front.

when I try to kill node _my_turtle I get this message: `ERROR: Unknown node(s):

/_my_turtle
Also when I runrosnode list` I get the following:
/my_turtle
/rosout
/rostopic_13088_1438192992473
/rostopic_13492_1438193756802
/teleop_turtle
/turtlesim

I also just noticed that my mode was set to Nodes/Topic (active). If I switch to Nodes only it looks better but not the same

Yeah Luke I am not sure. But your graph does not have to look exactly like the tutorial. the circle inside the square of each node is fine.

My suggestion is to run it again to see if you have any more issues.
