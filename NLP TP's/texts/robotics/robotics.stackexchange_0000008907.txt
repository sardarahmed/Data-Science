Q:

Inverse Kinematics of DLR/HIT II Hand

I am trying to find the inverse kinematics formulation of DLR/HIT II hand. Till now I had success in finding an analytical method described in the thesis of Mavrogiannis, Christoforos I. named Grasp Synthesis Algorithms for Multifingered Robot Hands, given in appendix B. 
My question is regarding the A.28 where the author calculates q3 but has mentioned previously in the text that q3 is equal to q2. 
Note: q here denotes joint angles

A:

It looks like maybe the author ditched the zero-based numbering, but I agree that it is hard to tell. 
Why not try to contact the author directly? His LinkedIn page shows he's currently a graduate research assistant at Cornell. I've contacted authors in the past and everyone I've gotten in touch with seemed pleased that I did so.
