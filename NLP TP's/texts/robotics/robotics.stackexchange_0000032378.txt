Q:

Best laptop/screen for viewing outdoors?

Hey, I know this might be a little offtopic, but I was wondering if anyone has anything they would recommend.  My current Thinkpad had 220 nits when it was new, but I can't see anything if its bright outside.  My phone (Samsung Nexus S) has 370 nits, but can be hard to see as well.
Specific models or general tips would be great!  Here's to helping ROS move outdoors. :-P

A:

You should be looking for a transreflective display. As opposed to trying to be brighter than the sun with a backlit display, a transreflective one uses the light emitted onto it. I believe some Sony Vaio or Panasonic laptops have them, but not for cheap.

Good idea. Just to add: Pixel Qi sells a DIY transreflective display that can replace a traditional netbook's display. I don't have any experience with that, though.
