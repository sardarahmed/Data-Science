Q:

How to take save a snapshot from my kinect to disk?

I'm trying to debug a problem with my Kinect not working right.
In the tutorial, there is a pretty standard way to view the camera stream:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color
Is there a similarly simple way to save a snapshot to disk?

A:

Left clicking on the image in image_view will save a screenshot to the directory from which you started image_view in c-turtle and below.  In Diamondback, you have to right click for this behavior; this prevents a lot of accidental frame grabs.  :)
For example, if you were in /home/murph/code/topSecret in your terminal and you ran rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color, the image would be saved in that directory.
Images are titled frame0000.jpg, frame0001.jpg, and so on.
