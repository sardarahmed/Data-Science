Q:

How to print pose of a robot using robot_state_publisher

Hi,
I want to print the pose of my robot using robot_state_publisher. I am adding the following code in my launch file

<include file="$(find
  p2os_urdf)/launch/upload_pioneer3at.xml"/>  <node pkg="robot_state_publisher"
  type="state_publisher"
  name="robot_state_publisher">       <param
  name="publish_frequency" type="double"
  value="30.0"/>  </node>

But, I am not sure, where can I see the pose of the robot? Is there any way I can print it ?

A:

You should create a new node in your workspace, and subscribe to the tf topic, then you can print the values of your coordinates in this new node. I hope this will help you.

No, I have Rviz setup, I can see the robot. But I want to see the values of the robot's pose.
For example:  x: 4, y: 5 theta:20

what about printing the coordinates to console, using ROS_INFO (or something like this) inside the robot_state_publisher node?

@Fredylucas That sounds like a good idea to me, but how can I print the values in robot_state_publisher node?

I take back what I said before, a better way is: you already have the coordinates in the topic published by robot_state_publisher (the topic is tf), you can subscribe to this topic in a new node in your workspace, and print the information in this new node using ROS_INFO.
