Q:

sdf model not showing in gazebo models list

Hello.
I have made a building layout using building editor and saved the file. Then I made a directory in ~/.gazebo/models/ (named my_world) and copied my sdf file there (named model.sdf). Then I created a simple model.cfg file like in this tutorial. Now the problem is when I run gazebo and click the insert tab I expect 'My World' to be listed there but it is not there.
Please tell me how I can view my model in gazebo. I am using Gazebo 4.
