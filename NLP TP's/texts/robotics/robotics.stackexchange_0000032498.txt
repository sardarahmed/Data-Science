Q:

ROS cannot communicate over network under Natty

After updating to Natty, ROS can't communicate locally via network ports no more.
Unable to contact my own server at [http://hostname:48064/].

Changing/setting the variables ROS_MASTER_URI, ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_IP according to this question didn't help. The tests according to the ROS network troubleshooting guide were partially successful.

ping works for 127.0.0.1, for localhost and for the hostname.
netcat works for 127.0.0.1 and for localhost, but not for the hostname.

Sorry, in case this is a rather pathetic network problem. Maybe it's something specific to Natty?

No, I substituted my actual hostname with hostname

Does the error message literally show 'http://hostname:48064/' or your hostname?

A:

Alright... it was a rather pathetic network problem. Actually I don't know why, but after the update to Natty, my /etc/hosts file didn't contain the IP adress from my local network anymore. The following entry fixed this.
192.168.1.XXX    hostname
