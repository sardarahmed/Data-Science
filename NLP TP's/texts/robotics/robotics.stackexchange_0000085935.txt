Q:

Moving turtlebot with own implementation of Astar

Hi,
I have managed to use turtlebot3 (gazebo and Rviz) to create a map and use its data to implement an Astar algorithm(in python).The result is the series of (x,y) coordinates to which robot should move. But now i am confused which topic to publish into to tell robot to move to those places in that sequence.I know there is move_base package but it uses its own path planners,i have read that you can create your own plugin but i feel i might be overthinking and it might be some other way.So i have two questions:
1- Which topic or topics to use to publish these locations?
2-My results are in coordinates system,do i have to convert them back into world coordinates?
Thanks.

A:

You should change the default global planner instead of publishing your own goals (to answer your question, there are 3 topics using goals : move_base/goal, move_base/current_goal, move_base_simple/goal )
You should find how to do it here #q188257.
You can define the global planner in the move_base.launch.xml (this is an exemple from turtlebot navigation) by adding this in the launch file inside the node tag : <param name="base_global_planner" value="carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner"/> or define the base_global_planner param in a yaml file.
And yes I think you should convert them to into the world coordinates because in general the algorithms are based on coordinates given by the costmap.
