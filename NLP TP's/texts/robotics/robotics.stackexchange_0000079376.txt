Q:

Where can I find depth_Astra_Orbbec.yaml?

Hi,
Where can I find depth_Astra_Orbbec.yaml file? I googled it but doesn't seem it is available anywhere.
I am using Astra camera, and I see these warnings.
I am trying to debug why the amcl doesn't work.
Any clue?

A:

Unable to open camera calibration file [/home/habals/.ros/camera_info/depth_Astra_Orbbec.yaml]

This is not a file that is provided for you, but one that you have to generate using (fi) the camera_calibration tool. That tool will perform an intrinsic calibration, which is what the node can't find. If it can't find it, it'll just use a default (ie: uncalibrated) one, which will most likely not work too well.

Thank you so much!
I got the rgb camera calibrated using the camera_calibration tool, but I cannot find how to calibrate the depth camera. It looks depth sensor is also way off now.
