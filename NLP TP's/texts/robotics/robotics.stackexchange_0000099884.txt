Q:

Get information of tf/tf2 by code

Hi you guys,
I'm quite new to ROS. I'm making a fake robot in Gazebo and I'm done with creating the model.
After execute "rostopic list", I saw /tf. And "rostopic echo -n 1 /tf" returns some information about position and orientation like in this image.
How can I get that information of a specific link by code, not all link at the same time?
How can I publish the new pose of a specific link by code and display it in Gazebo?
Thanks in advance.

Please see whether the TF2 tutorials can help you get an understanding of what's going on.
