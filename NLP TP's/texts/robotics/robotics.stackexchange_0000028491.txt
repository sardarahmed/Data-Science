Q:

How Gazebo generate heigthmaps?

Hello;
I'm trying to create a plugin , that , given a x,y coordinates, set the position of a model in the ground level of a heigthmap. I generate it  through a greyscale image (following this tutorial: https://github.com/AS4SR/general_info/wiki/Creating-Heightmaps-for-Gazebo). Does anybody know how gazebo generate the 3D surface from this grayscale image.
I use Gazebo 7 in ubuntu 16.04.

A:

You mean how does Gazebo internally transform the image into a collision shape? If so, take a look at gazebo::physics::HeightmapShape. Here's the source code.
