Hello everyone,
I have installed the baxter simulator in my PC, but when I run the baxter.sh, it comes this message:

I can not find some useful solution about this from google, thank you for help!

A:

The issue is definitely that you are using zsh as your default shell. On line 178 of the baxter.sh script, you can see they start a new shell using the SHELL environment variable with the argument --rcfile.  zsh doesn't have this argument available, and that is what triggers your error. If you want to use this script as-is, you can't use zsh. If you want zsh and this script, then you'll need to debug the script a bit
Just FYI, I personally never use the baxter.sh script when working with Baxter. All the script really does is ensure that you have set the ROS_MASTER_URI and the ROS_HOSTNAME/ROS_IP environment variables correctly. I manage these variables with my own scripts and avoid their script primarily because

their script requires you to actually edit it to update some of the variables -- this is not convenient for me. I work with multiple Baxter's that use the same workspace. I don't like needing to constantly change the script.
I don't like how they automatically change my prompt to be such a long string. I have a highly customized prompt, and don't want it to be messed with.
