Q:

how bagfile avoid to be rewritten

When I try to use bag file to store data, I find the bag file only store the data that I write last time. Last time means the last time to open the bag file and write data. Anybody knows how to add data to bag file?

I do not know if this is possible. However, you can always save bags with different name and the reproduce them in a sequence with a script.

Thank you for reply. Yes, I am doing exactly now as you say but I still want to see if adding data is possible. Anyway, thanks.

A:

I find the solution. Just change the bag open mode as
bag = rosbag.Bag('test.bag', 'a')
Mode 'a' means add in the file.

I'm happy you found the solution. However, your question was incomplete as I assumed you wanted to it from terminal instead of programatically :) How do will you deal with the difference in timestamps? Will the be a problem?

No. I use it in program not terminal. Actually, in my program, I record two timestamps by myself and I just omit its timestamp. : ) Is it kind of cheating?

I don't think that is cheating. Most algorithms will not require the timestamp, other to check that a new message has arrived, or something like that.
