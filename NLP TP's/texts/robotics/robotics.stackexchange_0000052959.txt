Q:

Any packages for graph plot?

Hello everybody,
Is there any packages available with ROS for 2d or 3d plotting of mathematical data (if possible, something similar to matlab plotting) ?
NOTE: I need to access the c++ output data dynamically for plotting.

A:

ROS has basic plotting abilities thanks to rxplot in http://www.ros.org/wiki/rxplot and rqt_plot here http://ros.org/wiki/rqt_plot but you can always write your 'plotting' node in python and then use the excellent matplotlib which can do practically everything matlab can in terms of plotting.

But 'matplotlib' is in python. I need to access the c++ outputs dynamically.
and Is there any with c++ ? or Is it possible to use matplotlib for accessing c++ outputs dynamically ?

You can also 'program' gnuplot inside a c++ code. But resort to this only when the rqt and rxplot utils do not suffice.
