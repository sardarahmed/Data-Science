Q:

Echoing custom messages over SSH error

I have a node running on an embedded platform publishing a custom message (just a float32[]). I have a ros master running on a different machine, and both ROS_MASTER_URIs and ROS_IPs are set correctly. On the master machine, if I run rostopic echo <topic>, I get:
 ERROR: Cannot load message class for [<package>/<msg>]. Are your messages built?

If I ssh into the embedded platform and run a rostopic echo <topic>, I get the data printed out.
I think I understand why it's not working - I haven't sourced the workspace on the embedded platform from the master - but I don't know the solution to this problem, since I want to be able to run nodes on multiple platforms, including the master.

A:

You should source or install the custom message on the master machine.   If it was std_msgs, it would be installed on both but a custom message would not be found on the master machine as the warning says.

I made a package specifically to hold the message I was using, then copied it across to my master and built the package (i.e., "install the custom message on the master machine"). This fixed the problem.
