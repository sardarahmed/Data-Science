A:

I'm in the process of trying to figure this out myself, so I won't be able to help you too much but I can point you in the right direction.
You'll need freenect_launch and  libfreenect
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-freenect-launch
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-libfreenect

Then you can launch it with (make sure the Kinect is connected, it will tell you to connect it if not)
roslanch freenect_launch freenect.launch

When it starts it will output some messages like below, which apparently is normal
...
[ WARN] [1447125024.427412294]: Using default parameters for IR camera calibration.
[ INFO] [1447125027.019823318]: Stopping device RGB and Depth stream flush.

After this you can follow the tutorial from the openni page, starting at step 3
http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch/Tutorials/QuickStart
For more information look around on the freenect and openni pages.

I have followed it and it is good. However, I am unable to measure depth by this method. In particular, I am using this (Links). I cannot use this command
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image

Please, suggest
