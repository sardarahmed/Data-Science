Q:

ompl GetMotionPlan

Hi everyone,
I'm working whit ompl motion plan service, in:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ompl_ros_interface/Tutorials/Specifying%20pose%20goals
when I do:
 ros::ServiceClient service_client = nh.serviceClient<motion_planning_msgs::GetMotionPlan>("/ompl_planning/plan_kinematic_path");
  service_client.call(request,response);
  if(response.error_code.val != response.error_code.SUCCESS)
  {
    ROS_ERROR("Motion planning failed");
  }

Always obtain: response.error_code.val != response.error_code.SUCCESS === FALSE
And if you see the planning log, you can see:
[ERROR] [1352218229.018731999, 4531.226000000]: client wants service /ompl_planning/plan_kinematic_path to have md5sum dc1bde6dccfb9e1ff4f7ed84e081f964, but it has e7f04013c167d0703692fec8a86b22ef. Dropping connection.

What this means? what is the problem??
Regards

A:

The problem is ros versions.
In electric does't exist motion_planning_msgs package. All necesary classes are in arm_navigation_msgs
motion_planning_msgs::GetMotionPlan --change--> arm_navigation_msgs::GetMotionPlan.
