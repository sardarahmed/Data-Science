Q:

Trouble running robot_upstart

Hello all.
I installed ros_upstart with this command sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-robot-upstar.
I can find the files in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/robot_upstart/ and /opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/robot_upstart.
I also did echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc and source ~/.bashrc.
After starting roscore I run this comand
rosrun robot_upstart install myrobot_bringup/launch/base.launch

and I get this error
Unable to locate path launch/base.launch in package myrobot_bringup. Installation aborted.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/robot_upstart/install", line 32, in <module>
    exit(main())
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/robot_upstart/install_script.py", line 83, in main
    if os.path.isfile(found_path[0]):
IndexError: list index out of range

I also tried sudo service myrobot start and got
myrobot: unrecognized service

Am I running the command in the wrong directory? Do I need to change something that is specific to my machine?
In advance. Thanks for any help

Hi,
I had the same problems and errors at my Ubuntu armhf RPI2.
I've noticed that the armhf packages are too old and tried to compile from source.
Same problem!
Plan-B:
$sudo apt-get install daemontools
create a file /etc/init/svscan.conf
start on runlevel [2345]

expect fork
respawn
exec svscanboot

$sudo mkdir -p /etc/service/mockbot
create a file /etc/service/mockbot/run
#!/bin/bash
export USER=ros
export HOME=/home/$USER
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
exec /opt/ros/indigo/bin/roslaunch mockbot mockbot.launch

Check service
$sudo service svscan status
svscan start/running, process 835
$sudo svstat /etc/service/mockbot
/etc/service/mockbot: up (pid 849) 1443043529 seconds
Now, your ros launchfile will be startet at system boot.
Not perfect as robot_upstart, but it works ;-)
Cheers
Chrimo

Thanks for the workaround but at the moment I'd like to continue with getting this going. If all else fails I'll try this.
