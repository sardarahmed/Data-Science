Q:

Using ROS with Kinect (Failed to set USB interface)

Trying to use ROS with Kinect.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_launch/Tutorials/QuickStart

This tutorial says it is as easy as plug in Kinect to USB and launch
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

But I get
process[camera_base_link3-21]: started with pid [32556]
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException'
  what():  unsigned int openni_wrapper::OpenNIDriver::updateDeviceList() @ /tmp/buildd/ros-fuerte-openni-camera-1.8.6/debian/ros-fuerte-openni-camera/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_camera/src/openni_driver.cpp @ 125 : enumerating image nodes failed. Reason: One or more of the following nodes could not be enumerated:

What am I missing or doing wrong?
