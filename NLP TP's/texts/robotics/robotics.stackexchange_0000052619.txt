Q:

turtlebot autonomous navigation with multiple goals

Hi,
I have got the turtlebot to navigate autonomously using the turtlebot tutorials. I was wondering if there is any package/tutorial out there to make the turtlebot handle multiple goals. For example, first go to goal #1, then goal#2 and so on. I assume this would not be possible using rviz and that I would have to write my own trajectory planner etc., For this, I was hoping to get hold of the source code that rviz uses and then modify it to suit my needs. Is there a way I can get the code (for sending a navigation goal and autonomously navigating there) used in rviz? Any guidance will be appreciated. Thanks.

I'm working on a similar project. Did you ever get this going? If you did, would you share your solution?

Hey. Can anyone provide a solution for this yet? I am trying navigation with multiple goals.
Thanks

A:

You can write your own node to program it. You might find move_base package documentation useful to achieve that : http://www.ros.org/wiki/move_base

@Lucile's answer is what I would recomend but to directly answer your question.  rviz's source can be found at: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz
