Q:

Where do the codes reside when I install a ROS package using apt?

I have recently installed turtlebot3 packages on my system using the apt package manager. But when I go into the package 'turtlebot3_teleop' I dont see any codes or anything. I just see a folder called 'launch' supposedly where all the launch files reside and a cmake file. I wanted to know where are the codes which make the turtlebot3  subscribe to the values I publish through my keyboard keys? Also where are the codes for the nodes which run when I run the launch file?
I have some idea that these packages are installed as binary packages, hence only their executable form is visible, but I don't have much clarity about this.
Pls explain
TIA

This seems like a duplicate of #q246775 and #q295677.

A:

There is no code when you install using apt. Those are precompiled binaries that get installed under /opt/ros/melodic/
Launch files are in /opt/ros/melodic/share/pkg_name/
Python code might also be there, look in /opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_name/
Best is to clone the repositories you need from github and compile them by yourself in a catkin workspace.
