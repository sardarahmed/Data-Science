Q:

Turn drone in given angle (left or right turn)

Hy!
Is there any -  already developed - way to turn my flying parrot ardrone 2.0 ? I can't find any info about this.
I want a topic or service, that will turn my drone for example 90 degrees left, if i type the command with the "90" parameter.
Please help me, it is urgent!!!
Thanks in advance!

Have you looked at the docs? https://ardrone-autonomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html

Yes, i did. But as you can see in the title of the post, i want to give an angle as parameter, not speed value.
Any useful answers will be appreciated.

Well, the title doesn't say that exactly but I did give you an alternative to ardrone_autonomy (actually it uses ardrone_autonomy) which may do what you want. Hopefully it's useful.

A:

There are no services or topics to do this using ardrone_autonomy that I have seen. You either have to develop it yourself or you can use tum_ardrone which is based on ardrone_autonomy. It includes a GUI in which you can send commands similar to how you want to send them. An example from the README,

goto [doube x] [double y] [double z] [double yaw]
flies to position (x,y,z yaw), relative to current reference point.
blocks until target is reached according to set parameters

So, you would type goto 0 0 0 90.0 in order to rotate 90 degrees. You can also write flight paths as a .txt file and load them from the GUI and have it execute them. If you want to do this via a node you may have to look at their code and see how they did this and copy it.
Here are the GitHub repo and entry on the ROS wiki.
