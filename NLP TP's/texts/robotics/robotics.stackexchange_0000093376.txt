Q:

How to plot the position of ethzasl_ptam in rqt_plot?

I have a ROS node (ethz-ptam) which publishes a topic /vslam/pose which is of type geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance message. Running:
rostopic type /vslam/pose | rosmsg show

gives the following:
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose
  geometry_msgs/Pose pose
    geometry_msgs/Point position
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
    geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
      float64 w
  float64[36] covariance

I'd like to use rqt_plot to plot a field (say Point position x). But I tried everything to "call" it in rqt_plot, but it doesn't work, the rqt_plot window shows like it should but the field is not plotted. From rostopic echo /vslam/pose I know that it is being published, so everything is working except rqt_plot. Also if I write inside the text-input-field in rqt_plot, like they say in the docs (topic-name/field:field:field): /vslam/pose/x or /vslam/pose/x:y:z nothing shows. According to the tutorials, in rqt_plot you should be able to hit the +Button next to the text-input-field, but this one is never active in my case, so it can't be pressed.
I am pretty sure that I am making some kind of mistake in referencing the message field  (like x). But since I tried all variants I could think of,  I'd really apprechiate some advice on how to do this and call/reference this field so that the position fields are displayed in rqt_plot.
Thanks!

A:

What you have seen in the docs is wrong, can you link your doc ? In the official documentation of the rqt_plot package there is this note specifying the proper syntax.
The link says :

The input value should be the full path to the value

So in rqt_plot you need to type /topic_name/field/field...
If you want to plot the x coordinate from your topic you need to type :
/vslam/pose/pose/pose/position/x

NB : There are 3 pose because the output of rosmsg show seems to indicate that your topic /vslam/pose publish geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped messages instead of geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance as you said. That means the first pose is from the topic name, the second one is the field of type geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance and the last one for the geometry_msgs/Pose field.

I would link the post I found regarding the syntax, but somehow now I can't find it anymore. Really stupid since I am sure about what I saw there and posted in my question. But someone must have cleared the browser history of this lab computer. Sorry.

No problem, even in the official documentation it can be misunderstanding as it's not the same syntax when using rqt_plot in command line or with GUI.
