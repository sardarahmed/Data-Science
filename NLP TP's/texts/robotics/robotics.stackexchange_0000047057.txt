Q:

(Groovy @ 12.04) Error on: $ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install

When I run the following command:
$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install

I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated", line 74, in <module> main()
File "./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated", line 70, in main quiet=mot args.verbose

Any suggestions? Kernel is armv7l

does ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make --install work? This will only work if you remove all non-catkin packages from the src folder

UPDATE:
It was an error linked to my other issue described in
(Groovy @ 12.04) E: Package 'libtbb-dev' has no installation candidate

HOWEVER:
Now that it is working, I am getting an error after installing Package 10 of 153, right after:
==> make -j2 in '/home/ubuntu/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/flann'
error: My Terminal Emulator is killing my ubuntu.img image connection, causing my androidVNC to shut down.

(Please note that the CPU Usage Monitor is way high during this part.)
Any suggestions to work around this?

A:

catkin_make_isolated is still somewhat in beta status.
File "./src/catkin/bin/.../python/catkin/builder.py"

attempts to run a shell command like
cmake /path/to/somepackage -D...

This raises "No such file or directory". This could mean you do not have cmake installed, or the path given to cmake does not exist.
To debug further change File
./src/catkin/bin/python/catkin/builder.py
in build_catkin_package, make the following change:
-    run_command_colorized(cmake_cmd, build_dir, options['quiet'])
+    try:
+        run_command_colorized(cmake_cmd, build_dir, options['quiet'])
+    except OSError:
+        sys.stderr.write('Command failed: %s" % cmake_cmd)
+        raise

Run this again, this should give you the command that failed. Run this manually on the shell and find out what goes wrong. If you find this is a bug in catkin, create a ticket at https://github.com/ros/catkin and post what the command was in your case.
