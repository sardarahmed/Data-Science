Q:

Turtlebot Indigo install from source failing to get rocon source

When I attempt to install the Indigo version of the Turtlebot package from source using the instructions here:
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Installation
When I run this step:
wstool init -j5 src https://raw.github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon/indigo/rocon.rosinstall

It ends with this error:
WARNING [vcstools] Command failed: 'git checkout hydro-devel'
 run at: '/home/myuser/rocon/src/rosbridge_suite'
 errcode: 1:
error: pathspec 'hydro-devel' did not match any file(s) known to git.
[/vcstools]
Exception caught during install: Error processing 'rocon_concert' : [rocon_concert] Checkout of https://github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon_concert.git version indigo into /home/myuser/rocon/src/rocon_concert failed.
Error processing 'rosbridge_suite' : [rosbridge_suite] Checkout of https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite.git version hydro-devel into /home/myuser/rocon/src/rosbridge_suite failed.

ERROR in config: Error processing 'rocon_concert' : [rocon_concert] Checkout of https://github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon_concert.git version indigo into /home/myuser/rocon/src/rocon_concert failed.
Error processing 'rosbridge_suite' : [rosbridge_suite] Checkout of https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite.git version hydro-devel into /home/myuser/rocon/src/rosbridge_suite failed.

Is there something wrong with the repository, the instructions, or did I miss something somewhere?
This appears to fix the problem, based on the accepted answer:
mkdir ~/rocon
cd ~/rocon
wget https://raw.github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon/indigo/rocon.rosinstall
vi rocon.rosinstall

REMOVE this line:
{'git': {'local-name': 'rosbridge_suite', 'version': 'hydro-devel', 'uri': 'https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite.git'}},

Then install the rosbridge-suite from deb:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosbridge-suite

And  use your edited .rosinstall file to pull everything else from github:
wstool init -j5 src rocon.rosinstall

If this fails, with an error like:
Exception caught during install: Error processing 'rocon' : [rocon] Checkout of https://github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon.git version indigo into /home/chrisl8/rocon/src/rocon failed.

ERROR in config: Error processing 'rocon' : [rocon] Checkout of https://github.com/robotics-in-concert/rocon.git version indigo into /home/chrisl8/rocon/src/rocon failed.

Just try again like this:
rm -rf src
wstool init -j5 src rocon.rosinstall

It appears that github sometimes has timeouts or something.
Then continue with the instructions . . .
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
catkin_make

A:

Rosbridge moved their branches recently, just remove that one from the rosinstall and install the deb instead (at the time of writing, there was no rosbridge deb yet). Jihoon will update the rosinstaller to be correct shortly.
