Q:

Odometry using IMU

Are there any algorithms for obtaining odometry using only an IMU module (MPU9250) without any vision related component?
If yes are there any ROS wrappers/packages for those libraries or algorithms?
TIA

A:

Probably some out there, but its going to be very error prone. A 9-DOF IMU only has an accelerometer to compute translational changes from. If you've taken any type of sensor lab in the past, you'll know double integrating acceleration is noisy business, especially with a low-cost consumer grade IMU like that.
You could feed in your IMU to robot_localization which should produce odometry based on the inputs. I'd highly recommend installing some encoders at minimum if not something else like a camera or lidar to compute some other corrections for the accelerometer.
