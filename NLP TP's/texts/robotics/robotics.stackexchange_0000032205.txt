Q:

Base_link doubt

Hi,
I'm using ROS navigation stack and I'm have a doubt with a configuration parameter of costmap2d.
I have a differential drive which shaft it isn't the center of the robot. I don't know where I have to put the base_link: in the rotation point or in the geometric center of the robot.
Could anyone help me?
Thank's in advance
Kind regards

A:

base_link (or base_footprint depending on your configuration) should go at the rotational center of the robot, i.e. the point about which the diff drive robot can spin-in-place. This assumes that base_link is the frame you will be using to command velocities relative to.
I don't know if this is actually explicitly stated anywhere, but it's how I've always configured move_base.
Note that you can always make another frame called "geometric_center" or something similar and publish a transform between that and base_link if you would prefer other transforms relative to the geometric center of the robot instead of the center of rotation.

Good point on this never being documented. I added a note in this tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF mentioning it.
