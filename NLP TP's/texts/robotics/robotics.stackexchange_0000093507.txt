Q:

Are there more frames in compressed BAG files?

I am following the same process to measure how many frames I supposedly have lost during recording with an Intel RealSense D435 camera as outlined here: https://answers.ros.org/question/332910/frames-dropped-during-video-recording/
I am finding that I have many files where 10000-15000 per 20000-30000 frames are being dropped... This is very significant, so I wanted to confirm whether there are "hidden" frames in compressed BAG files.

A:

There are no "hidden" messages (frames or otherwise) in compressed bag files.
As suggested in the previous post, I would attempt to inspect the bag file in rqt_bag, to see what the timing of the missing frames is. Based on missing almost exactly half of your expected data, I suspect your sensor may be running at 15fps instead of the expected 30 fps.
