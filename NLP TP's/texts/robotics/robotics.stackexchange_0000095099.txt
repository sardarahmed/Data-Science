Q:

move_group Python interface collision and visual mesh

Hi,
I am using the Python move_group interface for MoveIt.
planning_scene_interface.py specifies a function add_mesh to add a model to the scene, limited to only 1 mesh file.
Is it possible to add a model with both a collision and visual mesh to the planning scene?
I mean similar to how we specify collision and visual meshes for links in xacro files.
I am using ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.

A:

No.
That function is really just for publishing a "collision object".
It's not meant for adding arbitrary geometry to the scene.

If you could describe what you are looking to do exactly, perhaps an alternative could be found.

My goal is to visualize the robot task in realtime at the same time with the physical robot, including objects that are being moved

If it's just for visualisation, you could consider publishing Markers. rviz_visual_tools could help you with that.
If those objects should be taken into account by the motion planner, you really should be publishing collision objects.
You could of course combine this.
