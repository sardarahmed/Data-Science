Q:

How to source ROS Kinetic in Ubuntu Core via ssh?

Hi everyone,
I am having a small issue sourcing ROS kinectic in my Raspberry PI 3(OS: Ubuntu Core). Every time I want to use ROS i have to use the command source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash and then I can use ROS commands like roscore. But I want to source ROS kinectic in the bash file. I have tried sudo nano ~/.bashrc but doesnt source ROS automatically. Is there another way to source it in the bash file?
Thank you

A:

IIRC, logins over SSH are treated differently from regular logins, hence .bashrc is not being evaluated, and thus your source line isn't executed.
If you search Google for this you're bound to find many hints.

I have tried sudo nano ~/.bashrc [..]

Why the sudo? Are you running things as root?
