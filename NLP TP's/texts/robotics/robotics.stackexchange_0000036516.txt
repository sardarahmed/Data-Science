Q:

move_base vs geometry_msgs/PoseStamped md5 error, Electric, deb-install

I've just been trying to run (for the first time, so maybe I just set something wrong) move_base together with gmapping on ROS Electric (on Ubuntu 10.04). As soon as move_base goes up, an error appears:
[ERROR] [1323959697.184014051]: Client [/move_base] wants topic /move_base/goal 
to have datatype/md5sum [move_base_msgs/MoveBaseActionGoal/660d6895a1b9a16dce51fbdd9a64a56b], 
but our version has [geometry_msgs/PoseStamped/d3812c3cbc69362b77dc0b19b345f8f5]. 
Dropping connection.

I've installed all ROS packages via apt-get. There has been some update today, so maybe some of the packages weren't rebuilt properly. Has anyone else noticed this problem?

A:

It seems like youÂ´re somewhere mixing the actionlib-interface of move_base with the move_base_simple topic which expects to receive a geometry_msgs/PoseStamped. Are you running rviz and setting a goal-pose for the robot with it? If so, open the Tool Properties and (View-> Tool Properties) and set 2D Nav Goal to "move_base_simple"

OK, thanks a lot, seems to have been it. So it's my setup, I have to read a bit more about using gmapping with move_base and rviz, I guess.

Have you found a solution for this?
