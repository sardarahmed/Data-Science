Q:

How can I reduce a motor's maximum current draw?

I have a motor with a stall current of up to 36A. I also have a motor controller which has a peak current rating of 30A. Is there any way I could reduce the stall current or otherwise protect the motor controller?
I realize the "right" solution is to just buy a better motor controller, but we're a bit low on funds right now.
I thought of putting a resistor in series with the motor and came up with a value of 150mΩ, which would reduce the maximum current draw to 25A (given the 12V/36A=330mΩ maximum impedance of the motor). Is there any downside to doing this? Would I be harming the performance of the motor beyond reducing the stall torque?

A:

First of all the link you posted states that your motor driver carrier board has built-in overcurrent protection...so...where is the problem? 
If it does not have:
Put a fuse in series with the motor that will protect the controller (you can find slow fuses that allow higher current for short time). Then implment a current control loop with output saturation, basicly you give the pwm to the motor based on current (in mechanical terms it will be a torque controller with a maximum torque as a parameter). That way you have the fuse as a fallback safety and operationally if everything works finewith the current controller you can be sure that the fuse will not be used. 
I assume you need velocity controll or position control for the motor, that is no problem, just use cascading control loops where the inner loop in is a current (torque controller) the middle loop is a velocity controller and the outer loop is a position controller, like this. It is the way industrial drive amplifiers for motion control work...
