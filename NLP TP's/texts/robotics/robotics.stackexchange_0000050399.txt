Q:

Roslaunch XML format: is there a DTD?

Hi,
I am developing a ROS plugin for Vim and want to add support for editing of roslaunch files. Vim already has a built-in support for omni-completion of XML dialects as soon as the formal definition of a language is provided. So I am wondering does there exist a DTD for the roslaunch XML format?

I don't know if there is, but you could make one yourself.  Would be nice, if you finish this. My complete vim plugin is currently setfiletype xml.

Ha-ha yes, ft=xml is suprisingly useful :)
For sure I can create DTD myself, but I just hoped to avoid extra work and also simplify maintenance.

@sergey_alexandrov, if you end up doing this, it would be very useful to use as a basis for linting roslaunch files in roslint.

@mikepurvis No, in the end I decided it is not worth the effort, sorry...

A:

AFAIK there isn't.
One reason is that ROS uses TinyXML for parsing XML files which does not support DTD:
TinyXML doesn't parse or use DTDs (Document Type Definitions) or XSLs (eXtensible Stylesheet Language.) 

...so ROS tools cannot validate your launch file as they are implemented now. This aside, this would be definitively a very nice contribution.
