Q:

Is there a way to use rospy.info with complex messages?

When I search about rospy.loginfo all I get is examples with topics that publish string messages.
What happen with complex messages? If I have

def a_callback(msg):
rospy.loginfo("The messages is ",msg)

and msg is a complex message, is there a way to make it work? or should I do something like

rospy.loginfo("the message id is
%d",msg.header.id)

A:

What happen with complex messages?

you'll see The message is  followed by whatever is the __str__(..)/__repr__(..) representation of the message.
In rospy, this will print the (almost) YAML formatted version of the message contents.

Edit: and just to clarify: rospy.log*(..) doesn't do anything special with your logstrings. So anything which is a str, or can be converted to a str can be passed to it.
That makes your question more about "can 'complex messages' be converted to a str" than a question about rospy.log*(..).
