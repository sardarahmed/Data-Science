Q:

SubscribeOptions for image_transport subscriber

I would like my image_transport subscriber to use a different callback queue than the global queue so that when ros::spingOnce() is called my image_transport callback is not triggered.
Normally I would create a new callback queue and pass that to the subscriber constructor via SubscribeOptions but image_transport doesn't seem to support that.
I am curious why image_transport does not support seperate callback queues and what I should do to separate my image_transport subscriber from ros::spinOnce()

Could I ask you to post your approach / work-around as an answer and then accept your own answer? That way it's clearer that this question has been answered (instead of just closed).
Thanks.

I've re-opened it for you.

A:

Instead of separating the image_transport callback from the global callback queue, I have limited the global callback queue to the image_transport callback.
This isn't an elegant solution, i have to call callAvailable() which may not be clear to some other people who are less familiar to ros, but it does work.
I am still not sure why image_transport doesn't support the SubscribeOptions...
