Q:

Callback Problem with Multiple Subscribers

Hi,
I am working on a project which scans rooms and builds the complete map of the room.
The ros code that I wrote requires multiple subscribers (eg for Pose and Obstacles).
I want the subscription to be sequential. However with the use of spin() or spinOnce() my program gets stuck in the first callback function. How do I solve this problem ?

A:

What do you mean sequential?
ROS data comes from the system, whenever it is published.
If you want to match arriving data message filters might be, what you need.
