Q:

KnowRob Stack for RoboEarth in 11.10

Hello, I just updated the Ubuntu to 11.10 with the ros-electric and want to model 3D object with the RoboEarth. One of the dependencies of the RoboEarth is KnowRob but I found it's not available for 11.10. Thus I can't make the RoboEarth stack.
http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-electric-knowrob/
Could anyone tell me how can I install that dependency for RoboEarth for my Ubuntu 11.10?
Thank you very much.

Hi,
I've committed the Oneiric-compatible version of KnowRob: http://code.in.tum.de/pubsvn/knowrob/tags/latest/
The official release is underway but it will take some time until the .deb packages are built and distributed. Until then, installing KnowRob from source should work.
