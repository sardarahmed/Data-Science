Q:

How to install Rviz with Kinetic distro?

Hello,
I'm trying to add Rviz to ROS Kinetic 1.12.12, but there isn't instructions for this version on the user's guide.
I tried to run sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rviz but the console says it's "Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-rviz".
Is there something i'm missing ?
Thank you for your replies, have a good day.

(edit)
I forgot to mention i am using a Raspberry Pi3 with Raspbian stretch, that might not help...
So I ran the sudo apt update and i had the same errors as in #q325039. I followed the steps, now everything is normal I have the following output :
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get update
Hit:1 http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian stretch InRelease
Hit:2 http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian stretch InRelease
Hit:3 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu stretch InRelease
Reading package lists... Done

But i am still unable to locate the ros-kinetic-rviz package :(
And uname -a gives me :
Linux raspberrypi 4.9.59-v7+ #1047 SMP Sun Oct 29 12:19:23 GMT 2017 armv7l GNU/Linux

I didn't installed ROS myself, i flashed an image i found here on my SD card because i could not build all the libraries on my Pi (not enough RAM...). It looks like it has been installed from sources on the website, so i would like to try to build rviz from sources but have no idea how to do that.

Please post the output of sudo apt update and check whether you're running into #q325039.
Also: please show us the output of uname -a.

Okay i forgot to mention i am using a Raspberry Pi3 with Raspbian stretch

yes, that is important information to share. And also why I asked for the output of uname -a.

How did you install ROS? Using apt or building everything from source?
If the latter: you cannot mix apt with from-source builds.
Additionally: I'm not entirely sure, but I don't know whether there are binary packages available of ROS Kinetic for RPi's with Raspbian (Stretch).

A:

Okay, I realized the ROSberry page provided a link to download an SD Card Image with Ubuntu 16.04 (LXDE) and ROS Kinetic installed.
Rviz is already installed on this image and runs normally, so my problem is fixed ! I wish i saw that earlier haha :v
Thank you for your answers !
