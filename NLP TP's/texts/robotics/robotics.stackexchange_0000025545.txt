Q:

surface material colors from URDF and COLLADA

Gazebo 1.2.5 no longer seems to be picking up the material tag from the URDF file. This can be seen through the following commands (from this tutorial on the ROS wiki).
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
roslaunch gazebo_worlds table.launch

A screenshot can be seen here. I am facing the same problem in my robot models.
On a similar note, I have seen weird behavior in Gazebo from my COLLADA mesh models (this behavior was also similarly weird in Gazebo 1.0 + ROS Fuerte). I would like to use the colors as specified in the mesh file (rviz + RobotModel handle this correctly).
Gazebo seems to start with all the meshes painted grey. If any of the joints move, then the corresponding links seem to alternate between grey and the color as specified by the mesh. A video of this can be seen here.
I am not sure what information will be required to debug this, but I can place it online.
Edit #1:
Replacing the material tag as suggested by the SDF documentation and Nate's answer does not work. I've replace the material tag of all my urdf links with this line from my world file which I know works:
<material>
  <script>
    <uri>file://media/materials/scripts/gazebo.material</uri>
    <name>Gazebo/Green</name>
  </script>
</material>

Here is the generated urdf after running through xacro: test.urdf
Here is the world file I get from gazebo gui (after using save world as): test.world.
Notice all the material tags from URDF are empty (Search for "material/")
All the tags from my world SDF file are fine and rendered correctly.

Thanks!!

Ditto! I had to go back from ROS Groovy to ROS fuerte for this reason.

A:

fixed in trunk per commit, will make a groovy release soon.
Update 2012-01-22
simulator_gazebo 1.7.8 with a fix for the materials issue in tutorial is in shadow fixed, should make it out to the public repo soon.
