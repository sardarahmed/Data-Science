This seems strange: you have configured apt to download package indices for Ubuntu Trusty (ie: 14.04), but then ask apt to install ros-melodic-catkin. ROS Melodic is only supported on Ubuntu Bionic (ie: 18.04) so that cannot work.
You cannot install ROS Indigo packages on 18.04 either.
You've tagged your question with ubuntu-18.04.
Can you please clarify which version of Ubuntu you are using and which version of ROS you want to install?

python-catkin-pkg is already the newest version (0.4.13-100).
You might want to run 'apt --fix-broken install' to correct these.

you've cross-posted this question to SO within an hour of your post here on ROS Answers?

Sorry for the confusion. I have indigo...
[..]
I have Ubuntu 18.04 on a virtual machine

Which is it?
ROS Indigo only works on Ubuntu Trusty.
ROS Melodic only works on Ubuntu Bionic.
You cannot have both.

Hey I have melodic
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-24:
Can you please show us the output of lsb_release -a and uname -a?

Hey I have melodic

please understand: 'melodic' is the name of a ROS release, not an Ubuntu release. Ubuntu is your OS (ie: a Linux distribution). ROS is "just" a set of programs that run on top of your OS. Compare with Windows: if I ask you which Windows version you have installed, you cannot answer with "I have Office 2016".
Now by circumstances, if you say "I have melodic", we can sort-of assume you are running Ubuntu Bionic as your OS. But we need to be sure. So please run the two commands I've asked you to run and show us what the output is.

Hi!  The output outputs of lsb_release -a and uname -a are:
notsotechnical@notsotechnical-VirtualBox:~$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu

The output outputs of lsb_release -a and uname -a are:

So you have Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) running in VirtualBox.
First: you cannot install ROS Indigo on Ubuntu Bionic (or at least, not easily, and I would not recommend it if you're just starting out).
So I'll assume you want to install ROS Melodic.
Did you follow the normal Melodic on Ubuntu installation tutorial? If so, please clarify why apt is attempting to download trusty package indices as seen in the apt output you posted:

Hit:6 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty InRelease

Did you create this VM yourself? Was it perhaps configured for Trusty+Indigo and have you upgraded it to Ubuntu Bionic?
What is the output of:
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

If you've followed a regular install, this file should tell us which version of the package indices you've configured apt to download.
Additionally: in an earlier edit you showed this:

notsotechnical@notsotechnical-VirtualBox:~$ rosversion -d

Debian

this suggests that you have installed -- at one point -- the UpstreamPackages version of some ROS packages. See #q333234 for a similar question and why you get Debian as output.
In order for a regular ROS install to succeed, you'll have to remove those packages from your system first.

Hi Thank u!  I think I have installed melodic and catkin, but I'm having trouble creating a string message in a ros package... Does it have anything to do with the Debian packages?
https://answers.ros.org/question/333844/how-to-create-a-ros-package-with-catkin-correctly/
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-25:\

I think I have installed melodic and catkin

how did you determine this?
I'm also slightly puzzled by your fixation on Catkin specifically. It will be installed as part of a regular ROS install, so no need to install that separately.

but I'm having trouble creating a string message in a ros package... Does it have anything to do with the Debian packages?

Please don't post questions in comments under (as of yet) unanswered questions.
Let's first make sure you have ROS properly installed.
What is the output of rosversion -d now? And do you have files in /opt/ros/melodic?
Comment by notSoTechnical on 2019-09-26:
@gvdhoorn . It's a long story... I can't get Ubuntu 18.04 running anymore and I can't fix it... Anyway, I have indigo 64bit now from https://nootrix.com/downloads/#RosVM
I will keep you updated once I get Ubuntu 18.04working again
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-09-26:\

I have indigo 64bit now

please note that both Ubuntu Trusty and ROS Indigo are EOL and no longer supported.
