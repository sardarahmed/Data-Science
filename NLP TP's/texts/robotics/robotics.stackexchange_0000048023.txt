Q:

Boost (signals) library not found

Hello,
I am building ROS on Mac OSX from source, and when trying to run rosmake -a I get the following message for a number of packages:
ld: library not found for -l:/usr/local/lib/libboost_signals-mt.dylib

Boost 1.52 is installed and that file does exist, should I install a different version of boost? Or is something else perhaps going on?

Just a small update, I tried installing boost 1.49, but I get the same error.

A:

Alright, I do not know why, but it appears some .pc files in ~/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/lib/pkgconfig contained links to libraries in the form of :
-l:/path/to/lib/lib.dylib

While it should have been :
-l/path/to/lib/lib.dylib

(minus the ':'). I removed all the ':' from these pc files and that fixed it. Perhaps I should open a ticket?

This should not be a problem, I just rebuilt the desktop variant last night (with the latest XCode and brew packages) and never ran into this problem. What version of OS X and XCode are you using?

I'm having same issue on OS X 10.7.5 and Xcode 4.6. Replacement of -l: with the following command solves it: find *.pc -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i .bak 's/\-l:/\-l/g'

If you've installed to /opt/ros/groovy, the following command should do the job. cd /opt/ros/groovy/lib/pkgconfig ; find . -name  *.pc -print0 | xargs -0 sudo sed -i .bak 's/\-l:/\-l/g'
