Q:

ros-load:load-system doesn't load the package

Hi,
I run roslisp_repl and try the following command
(ros-load:load-system "cram_moveit" :cram-moveit)
The package is never loaded and the following warning is generates
System 'x-xml' is compiled by a different process. Waiting for compilation of blocking file to finish.
I am not sure what I am doing wrong. This package used to load just fine.

A:

It looks like if I delete .ros folder and then try loading the packages again it works.

Yes, you probably killed the building process before it could remove the lock which is stored in the .ros directory. You should "Mark as correct" the answers if they work for you, otherwise you flood the board with unanswered questions.
