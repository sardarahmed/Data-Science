Q:

Specifying which compiler to use

When I run the catkin installation it appears that cmake is using the PGI compiler available on the system I am using.  I did not explicitly tell it to use that, so I assume that it just decided that was the best one to use.  However, while building the rospack package I get an error saying that it does not recognize the -Wall switch.  I would like to force the build process to use the GNU compilers instead of the PGI one.  Where can I change this?

A:

Try this:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/c++ --force-cmake

the force-cmake flag is neccessary, I just tried it out ;)

It appears that I only get this issue when running catkin_make_isolated.  Running catkin_make does not appear to have the same problem recognizing flags.
