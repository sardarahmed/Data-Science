Q:

gazebo failing with .model

I am working with the objects wihin gazebo_worlds, and whenever I try and spawn .model into gazebo using the command
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file name.model -gazebo -model thing
My gazebo gets the error
[empty_world_server-1] process has died [pid 17337, exit code 134, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/scripts/gazebo /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_worlds/worlds/empty.world __name:=empty_world_server __log:=/home/carol/.ros/log/715ceed4-bad5-11e1-9ffc-00268297df80/empty_world_server-1.log].
log file: /home/carol/.ros/log/715ceed4-bad5-11e1-9ffc-00268297df80/empty_world_server-1*.log
I am wondering if this is a common problem and if there is a fix to it by any chance.

Hi,
Kindly provide a little more detail about the model file, I am assuming you have gone through the tutorial at : http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/SpawningObjectInSimulation
as your command is correct. Let me know if this command works:-

rosrun gazebo spawn_model -gazebo -file `rospack find gazebo_worlds`/objects/coffee_cup.model -model coffee_cup -x 1.2 -z 1 

Also from the folder where I have desk4.model,
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -gazebo -file desk4.model -model mydesk2
is able to spawn the table.

I guess you should add `` for rospack find. rosrun gazebo spawn_model -gazebo -file rospack find gazebo_worlds/objects/coffee_cup.model -model coffee_cup -x 1.2 -z 1

Yuup rospack find gazebo_worlds should be in quotes. But is this command able to spawn the coffee_cup.model file?
