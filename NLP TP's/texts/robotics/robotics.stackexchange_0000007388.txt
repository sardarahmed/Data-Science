Q:

Fingerprinting/ model matching algorithms for localization

This paper mentioned the fingerprinting/model matching case. But I could not find an image based algorithm. Any suggestion about image based localization

A:

For fingerprint matching model, try working with SVM (support vector machines) algorithm, it is a based supervised learning model. For localization purpose you need to match ridges and bifurcation found in fingerprints.
