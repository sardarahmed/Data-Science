Q:

ROS TURTLESIM using PYTHON

In ROS TURTLESIM, While moving the turtle in circle using the linear velocity and angular velocity , how do i track the distance so as to stop the turtle moving after one revolution ??

A:

write a distance function with the maximum value being the circumference, use rospy's Time function to update distance and whenever the current_distance exceeds the circumference, publish a zero velocity msg to stop the turtle.
