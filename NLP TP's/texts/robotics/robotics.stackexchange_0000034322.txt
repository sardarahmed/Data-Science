Q:

Why pursue not stopping after the first message output?

My code is
 CPL> (top-level
       (pursue
         (format t "First~%")
           (format t "Third~%")
           (format t "Second~%"))
             )
 
 First
 Third
 Second
 NIL
 CPL>

Why answer is not just 'First'?
Because cram tutorials doc says : 'Only the first form is executed. The other forms are evaporated.'
Thank you~

A:

Your code is slightly different from that one of the tutorial. The tutorial says:
(top-level
  (pursue
    (format t "First~%")
    (seq
      (sleep 2)
      (format t "Third~%"))
    (seq
      (sleep 1)
      (format t "Second~%"))))

Please note the sleeps. What happens in your case is that all three forms terminate very quickly and pursue doesn't have a chance to evaporate any of the tasks. With the sleeps, you force Third and Second to take long enough to be evaporated.
