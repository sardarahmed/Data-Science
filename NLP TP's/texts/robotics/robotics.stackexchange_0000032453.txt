A:

They are available through the CameraInfoMessage published on /camera/depth/camera_info or /camera/rgb/camera_info

You can find the message documentation if CameraInfo here http://www.ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CameraInfo.html.  In general, you can find a link to the message documentation from the package page.  So the CameraInfo link is found here http://www.ros.org/wiki/sensor_msgs.

Wim thanks... when i type rostopic echo/camera/depth/camera_info,i get matrices D, K, R and P... what are they for?

Running 'rostopic list' will show you all available topics.  I'd definitely recommend the tutorials to get more comfortable with the different ROS tools and concepts http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials.

I'm not sure what more to tell you. If you're not familiar with publishing, you probably want to go over the tutorials again.

It's published when you run the openni_camera node.
