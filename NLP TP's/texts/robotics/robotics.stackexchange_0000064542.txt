Q:

Sub meter ROS compatible GPS

Hello Folks,
I am in need of a GPS device that currently works with ROS that has a better accuracy than 1 meter.
Does anyone have any suggestions or information that could help.

A:

Clearpath tends to supply the NovAtel SMART-6 when clients need such accuracy. It'll go down to 2 cm if the right upgrade options are selected, a base station is available,  and everything's configured properly (warning: Don't underestimate the configuration time). It works with the standard navsat driver as well.

Thank you for you're answer. Do you happen to know of any database of nmea compatible devices? To top off my request I forgot to mention we need the device to be relatively small.

I can't think of any database, no. AFAIK, GPS devices which can't be configured for NMEA output are rare.
