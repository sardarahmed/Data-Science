Q:

Cannot load dependencies of stack [segway_rmp]: segway_rmp

Hi,
I just followed the instructions in ROS wiki website http://www.ros.org/wiki/segway_rmp to install segway_rmp in my computer.
But it came with the following problem:
Stack: segway_rmp
Cannot load dependencies of stack [segway_rmp]: segway_rmp
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/turtlebot
ROS path [2]=/home/lilimeng/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [5]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [6]=/home/lilimeng/ros_workspace
So what's the problem? Your help is highly appreciated
