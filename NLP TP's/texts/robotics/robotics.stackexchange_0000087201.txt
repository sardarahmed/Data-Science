Q:

How can I correct the problem in a simple question

Recently, I learnt on ros_ignite. I just start learning on topics.
The slogan is:
Create a package with a launch file that launches the code simple_topic_publisher.py.
Modify the code you used previously to publish data to the /cmd_vel topic.
Launch the program and check that the robot moves.
1.- The /cmd_vel topic is the topic used to move the robot. Do a rostopic info /cmd_vel in order to get information about this topic, and identify the message it uses. You have to modify the code to use that message.
2.- In order to fill the Twist message, you need to create an instance of the message. In Python, this is done like this: var = Twist()
3.- In order to know the structure of the Twist messages, you need to use the rosmsg show command, with the type of the message used by the topic /cmd_vel.
4.- In this case, the robot uses a differential drive plugin to move. That is, the robot can only move linearly in the x axis, or rotationaly in the angular z axis. This means that the only values that you need to fill in the Twist message are the linear x and the angular z.
5.- The magnitudes of the Twist message are in m/s, so it is recommended to use values between 0 and 1. For example, 0'5 m/s.
Here is the given code, but there is a problem:
move_robot.py
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

rospy.init_node('move_robot_node')
pub = rospy.Publisher('/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=1)
rate = rospy.Rate(2)
move = Twist()
move.linear.x = 0.5 #Move the robot with a linear velocity in the x axis
move.angular.z = 0.5 #Move the with an angular velocity in the z axis

while not rospy.is_shutdown(): 
  pub.publish(move)
  rate.sleep()

move_robot.launch
<launch>
    <node pkg="exercise_21" type="move_robot.py" name="move_robot_node" output="screen" />
    
    </node>
</launch>

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag: line 4, column 6

How can I correct the problem?

You should make short question that the answer is for eliminating single problem at a time.

A:

This error indicates that there is a syntax error in your launch file: Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag: line 4, column 6
"mismatched tag" in XML means that you have a close tag (starts with </) that the XML parser wasn't expecting. In this case, you've closed the node tag twice: once by using a self-closing tag (<node/>) and again with an explicit close tag on line 4, where the parser pointed out your error (</node>).
You should change your launch file so that you either use matching open and close tags ( <node> and </node> ) or use the self-closing tag ( <node/> )
I suggest
<launch>
    <node pkg="exercise_21" type="move_robot.py" name="move_robot_node" output="screen" />
</launch>

Thank you! You are right. But when I changed the .launch file. A new problem occurred...
It is said: ERROR: cannot launch node of type [exercise_21/move_robot.py]: can't locate node [move_robot.py] in package [exercise_21]
I tried to solve it by chmod +x move_robot.py
Comment by Pujie on 2018-05-31:
But a new problem occurred again, it is : Unable to launch [move_robot_node-1].
If it is a script, you may be missing a '#!' declaration at the top.
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file.   Could you please tell me how to solve this one?

I solved problems in move_robot.py. I omitted the #! /usr/bin/env python in python file. I used to think it is useless.
