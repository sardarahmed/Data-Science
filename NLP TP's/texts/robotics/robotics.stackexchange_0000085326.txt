Q:

How to make my package publicly available?

I wrote a ROS package for the yoctopuce altimeter. I'm fairly certain it's the only form of ROS support for the altimeter, and I would like to make it publicly available via the ROS website. How do I go about doing this?

A:

I believe this is nicely covered by wiki/Get Involved: Create Your Own ROS package Repository and the subsequent section Release Binary Packages.

Thank you! I was looking for something like this.

Btw: this doesn't make your pkg any more 'official' than others, but it does make it available to other users for installation using apt-get.
