Q:

RGBD-SLAM error

Hello,
I am trying to run the rgbdslam algorithm by following the instructions described in http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam. This is what I get when I type in the command rosmake rgbdslam_freiburg

I am very new to ROS and am not sure where the error is coming from. Thanks in advance.

A:

If I recall correctly, this is an issue with g2o. Try roscd g2o, and if you get an error, that is your first problem. If you do change to the g2o directory, try rosmake g2o. If it doesn't make correctly, you might need to install dependencies with rosdep install g2o. Beyond that, I can't give more specifics without further knowledge of the error.

Thanks for your fast response, I tried roscd g2o and I got: roscd: No such package/stack 'g2o'.
note: in the rgbdslam_freiburg folder there is an empty g2o folder.
What do you recommend?
Comment by autorover on 2012-12-17:
With the error you posted, ROS can't find the g2o package. You should move it to a location that can be found or add the location it is in the the ros package path, either manually with $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or with rosws. roscd should find the g2o folder if you do it correctly.
