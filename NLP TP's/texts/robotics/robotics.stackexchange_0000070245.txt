This post contains multiple different questions. Please open a new one for different questions, so people can find appropriate answers. It seems 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5 could be individual posts.

A:

This basically compiles the code. There might be additional actions in the cmake file as e.g. downloading patches.
This takes the build products and moves them to the install folder dependent on the install rules. WIth catkin you don't necessarily need the install step as you can use the devel folder without installing.
