Q:

What is the technology used for no-resistance robot arms?

I saw a high end robot arm once that I could move and bend it to any form I wanted with no resistance, as if the robot arm didn't have any weight. I'd like to know more about them. What is this class of robot arm design called? Where can I get some more information about its design and applications?

A:

It's called compliance. Gravity compensation by itself is not enough to achieve this, as well it is not mandatory. For example, if reducers with high reduction ratios are used, robot arm will be very stiff to move around.
One way to make robotic arm compliant is to have torque sensors that can measure the differences in expected load (i.e. weight of the arm) and actual load, when you try to move and arm. Then you simply amplify difference enough to help user to move an arm. This is called active compliance.
You can also compute expected load before hand using knowledge of the arm configuration and inertial parameters. If arm is not moving, this is called gravity compensation, thus when you try to move an arm you do not feel its weight, but only joint stiffness.
To get information of how to compute torques for gravity compensation and how to make robot compliant I recommend this course:
