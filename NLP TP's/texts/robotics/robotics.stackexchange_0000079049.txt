Q:

Operating ROS node from HTTP

Hi Everyone,
What i want to do is to send the robot a destination goal from a website I created.
I already have a node that sends the robot the destination.
i'm guessing that i need to make a node that listens to the http port and reads what link has been pressed on the website.
and then start the node that I already have to send the location goal.
but how can i do that?
any help would be much appreciated!

A:

Take a look at wiki/rosbridge_suite and the related RobotWebTools.
I'd also take a look at some of the existing web based interfaces.
