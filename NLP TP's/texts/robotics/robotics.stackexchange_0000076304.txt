Q:

How do you modify the velocity multiplexer for turtlebot?

I have a Kobuki Turtlebot and would like to publish to the multiplexer on my own topic. The official documentation hasn't done me well explaining how to modify the parameters.
Where can I find the config and YAML files discussed in the documentation and how can I edit them?
I am currently writing a rospy script for this, below is a simple implementation of what I'm trying to do.
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rospy.init_node('CmdVelMux_test', anonymous=True);
    velPub = rospy.Publisher('/cmd_vel_mux/input/BSC', Twist, queue_size=10);
    Vx = Twist();
    Vx.linear.x = 0.1;
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        velPub.publish(Vx);
        rospy.spin;

A:

Quoted from the page you gave "Since Hydro the package is renamed to yocs_cmd_vel_mux".
The yaml file is inside yocs_cmd_vel_mux package.
which is e.g. /opt/ros/indigo/share/yocs_cmd_vel_mux/param
To get there:
roscd
cd share
cd yocs_cmd_vel_mux
cd param

There you go:
example.yaml  reconfigure.yaml
The files that are described in the official doc that you mentioned

I have literally read the entire page three times and that small sentence never popped up to me. Makes me feel...unscholarly :P thanks for pointing that out!
