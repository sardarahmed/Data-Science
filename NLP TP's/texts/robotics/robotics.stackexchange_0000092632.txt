Q:

nav_msgs Path: is it possible to separate the visualized trajectories?

Hello,
I'm using the nav_msgs::Path message to visualize multiple trajectories.
With one path publisher!
I want to separate these trajectories, i mean, i don't want them to be connected with the line when its visualized in RViz.
Is it possible to break somehow the visualized path?
I tried to solve it by adding a dummy pose of x,y,z=nan, but that did not work, since RVIZ couldn't visualize the path due to Nans.
I also tried to change the frame_id of the dummy pose, but  that resulted in basically a xyz=0 (a 2 lines were drawn to 000 in rviz).
Thank you in advance.

That's not what nav_msgs::Path is designed for so it won't work. You can do this with a geometry_msgs::Marker LINE_LIST type. Or you could use multiple publishers of nav_msgs::Path

Thank you. Could you put this into an answer? I will accept it.

@PeteBlackerThe3rd it turns out that the LINE_STRIP is the one i need to use for path visualization. But still i don't understand how should i "break"/separate the paths? Suppose i have the following points for two trajectories:
x , y, z
1, 0, 0 <- traj1, point1
1, 1, 0 <- traj1, point2
0, 1, 0 <- traj1, point3
BREAK/SEPARATION IS REQUIRED HERE
-1, 1, 0 <- traj2, point1
-1, 0, 0 <- traj2, point2
-1, -1, 0 <- traj2, point3
how can i separate traj1 and traj2 with the geometry_msgs::Marker LINE_STRIP?

That's why I recommended the LIST_LIST type. You will need to double up the points within each path, to make them continuous, but that means you can also represent unconnected paths within the same message.

@PeteBlackerThe3rd
OKay then, im working on it. Thank you.
Should i copy your comment into the answer section?

Yes, feel free to add that if you write up an answer to your question.

A:

The answer is based on the comment of @PeteBlackerThe3rd.
visualization_msgs::Marker::LINE_LIST;

should be used for the visualization of multiple/separated trajectories.
The points in the path should be doubled up to make them look continuous.
