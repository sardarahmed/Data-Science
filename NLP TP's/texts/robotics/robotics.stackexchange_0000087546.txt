Q:

Ping from .launch file

Hello! I am attempting to add a line to my ros .launch file that would emulate the 'ping ##.#.###.##' command used in the command line. Is this possible? I am running Ubuntu 16.04. Thanks!

A:

'emulate' or actually run ping?
If the latter: see #q272267.
Running regular (ie: non-ROS) binaries from roslaunch is possible, but requires some special care.
The example there is with Python, but a simple bash script should also work.

With the assistance of your answer, I made a small python script and put that in the launch file. Thank you!
