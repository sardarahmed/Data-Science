Q:

Anyone success run rviz from launch file on Nvidia TX1?

Hi,
I am trying to run rviz from launch file and it failed. I can run it manually from terminal but when I put it in launch file it failed.
If you can do it please tell me necessary steps to have it run.
Thank you very much.
Edit 1:
The reason I think it's TX1 is because if I remove the last line to run rviz the the launch file work normally. I then can run rviz on a separate terminal with no problem.
Launch file:
<launch>  
    <arg name="model" />  
    <param name="robot_description" textfile="$(find mastering_ros_robot_description_pkg)/urdf/pan_tilt.urdf" />  
    
    <param name="use_gui" value="true"/>
    <node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher" />  
    <node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher" />
    <node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="-d $(find mastering_ros_robot_description_pkg)/urdf.rviz" required="true" /> 
</launch>

Error:

Edit 2:
I tried to install libpcre as follow command
ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~/Documents/Packages$ sudo dpkg -i libpcre3_8.35-7.1ubuntu1_armhf.deb 
[sudo] password for ubuntu: 
(Reading database ... 195694 files and directories currently installed.)

Then I got this error
ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~/Documents/Packages$ sudo apt-get install -f

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.
E: Unable to correct dependencies
ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~/Documents/Packages$ 

Does it mean I already have this package installed?

This seems less like an issue with the TX1 and is more likely an issue with your launch file or your rviz config. It might be helpful to post your launch file and any errors you get when you run it.

A:

Check out the comment of dchang0 on this github issue. There are also other suggestion to fix the segfault of rviz, but installing libpcre as suggested has worked for me on TX1 and TK1

I remember having that issue but unfortunately I don't remember how I resolved it. Maybe I just ignored it?
