Q:

successful os x 10.6 install? anyone?

Hi, I have a brand new 64bit macbook pro with os x 10.6.  I am wondering if anyone has successfully installed the bare bones version of ros with a similar setup?  Is there any initiative to get a package based installer?
I went through the tutorial for installing and poked around some forums for answers to bugs, but at this point I have been watching macports try and build atlas for about 2 hours.
Is there a non-macports based installation for os x 10.6?  I am curious if anyone has even got it running/has a personal walk through on the setup.

You probably just have to wait the atlas package out.  It took the better part of an evening to get everything installed on 10.6.

A:

I just installed diamondback from source on my MacBook Pro (10.6.7) following the installation instructions.
It worked fine for me.  I've built  the ros, ros_comm, and ros_tutorials stacks, as well as some others.  Depending on how much of MacPorts you have installed, it can take quite a long time to build the system dependencies (e.g., at some point you might be building gcc4.4).  You just have to wait it out.
