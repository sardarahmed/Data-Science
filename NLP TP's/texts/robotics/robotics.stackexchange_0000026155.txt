Thanks @Andrei. I designed my model in Gazebo 1.5. It can easily controllable from Gazebo GUI but I want to control it from ROS so that I can move and get feedback from ROS. For that purpose so far I accomplished to get ROS running plugin (according to tutorial) but I  want to know that what and where exactly I make changes to achieve it?
