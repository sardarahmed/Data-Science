Q:

(Cont'd) ROS build customization inconsistency

Just curious that in $(ROS_ROOT)/rosconfig.cmake (in my case /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/core/rosbuild/rosconfig.cmake) in diamonback on my environment, still seems to remain contradictory as discussed here although I found it was fixed (here). Does this mean the spec is changed afterward or else?
(I'm not sure if this is the right place to point out the stuff like this though)
Thanks.

A:

The fix was committed in April, after the Diamondback release.  As it was just a change to comments, I didn't backport the fix to Diamondback.  Electric will have the comments that correctly describe the configuration behavior.
Note that the behavior hasn't changed; we're just talking about the documentation of the behavior.
