Q:

No module named msg

Hello,
I am using an Arduino Uno with a Raspberry Pi on ROS indigo.
When I run this command :  rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py 
I don't understand why I get this error message :

> pi@raspberrypi:~/catkin_ws/src $ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py 

Traceback (most recent call last):

File "/home/pi/catkin_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_python/nodes/serial_node.py", line 40, in 
import rosserial_python

File "/home/pi/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosserial_python/__ init__ .py", line 35, in 
exec(__fh.read())

File "<'string'>", line 1, in <'module'>

File "/home/pi/catkin_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_python/src/rosserial_python/SerialClient.py", line 47, in <'module'>

from rosserial_msgs.msg import *

ImportError : No module named msg

And I also don't understand where my script is looking for when running 'from rosserial_msgs.msg import*' line in python.
In :

/home/pi/catkin_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_msgs/msg

Or in :

/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

Or somewhere else ?
Regards,
Matthieu

A:

Make sure that you have run catkin_make inside the catkin_ws directory. If you have already done that, I suspect that you have not added your catkin_ws in your bashrc. If you haven't, just run the following command:
echo "source /home/pi/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> /home/pi/.bashrc

Then close all terminals or run (on each open terminal):
source /home/pi/.bashrc

Thanks you very much. It works!
I missed   >> /home/pi/.bashrc
