Q:

including multiple copies of the same model in the file.world?

Hello,
Is there a way to include multiple copies of the same model with different position in the world file?
For example:
I have the coke_can model, that I want to include multiple copies of it in my world file as following:
  <include>
      <uri>model://coke_can</uri>
      <pose>-0.0 -2 0 0 0 0</pose>
   </include>

    <include>
        <uri>model://coke_can</uri>
        <pose>-0.0 -5 1 0 0 0</pose>
    </include>

but when I do this , the first model overrides the second one. In other words , only the first model shows up in the world file.
Any ideas or suggestions to solve this are very much appreciated!
Thanks in advance.

A:

Use the <name> tag to give different names to each model. e.g.
<include>
    <uri>model://coke_can</uri>
    <name>coke1</name>
    <pose>-0.0 -2 0 0 0 0</pose>
</include>

<include>
    <uri>model://coke_can</uri>
    <name>coke2</name>
    <pose>-0.0 -5 1 0 0 0</pose>
</include>

Can something similar be done from the world launch file?
