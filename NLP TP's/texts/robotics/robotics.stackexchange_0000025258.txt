Q:

3rd Party Libraries

Hello,
Is posible to use 3rd Party Libraries in the plugins like opencv (I tried to used but I don't have any problems compiling but when I tried to execute the program I have problems finding the simbols) or are there any way to get the image from the camera executing my program not a plugin.
Thanks.

A:

You should be able to use any third party library. For example the gazebo_ros plugins are plugins to Gazebo that use ROS libraries.
Can you create a simple standalone application that links against opencv and also executes?
You can also check your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, which should contain the path to the opencv library.
