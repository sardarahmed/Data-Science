Q:

How to transform the acceleration data from IMU to velocity

I am currently using  Xsens MTi-28A53G35 IMU for the the motion tracking on our robot. The IMU only puts out linear and angular acceleration and orientation data. Is there an node that can transform this to linear velocity so I can use it to localize the robot and help improve the accuracy of odometry.

Hi, Did you do it Mr. @smartkian88@gmail.com

A:

I'm guessing your IMU puts out linear acceleration, angular velocity, and absolute orientation. While I have a branch of robot_localization that will take in linear acceleration data, I should point out that the double integration of linear acceleration as your only source of absolute position will produce a really poor estimate. If you had some estimate of your vehicle's linear velocity, such as from your robot's wheel encoder odometry, then you'd definitely benefit from the linear acceleration data.

Update: the released version of robot_localization now supports this feature.

So robot_localization supports calculating the velocity with an IMU. How can I use this feature? I don't see a parameter that I can set. I understand that the imu0_config only describes which data should be used from imu0, am I wrong?

The IMU provides linear acceleration. Set those values to true, and the filter's kinematic model will integrate them into velocities. Be warned, though: there is no bias estimation, so biases will quickly cause the velocity to grow without bound (unless you have another velocity reference).

can i use "IMU" in linear movement to create a 2D map or calculate the linear velocity??
