Q:

How could I install a previous version of ROS?

I had ros 1.1.3-0trusty-20140805-0935-+0000 in my machine earlier. I had a ros package I build from source worked fine with this version. However, after I upgraded my ros to  1.1.4-0trusty-20160208-135350-0800, above package even after I build from source again won't work anymore.
So how could I downgrade my ros version to  1.1.3-0trusty-20140805-0935-+0000
(using apt-get)
Thank you

In general a patch release should not break your code. Can you explain more about what no longer works and what specific package you're referring to the version of? There is no "ros" package. I suspect that there's a better way to get your system working than downgrading this patch version.

A:

Theo Answers is no, because only the News packets arge hosted. The only thing  you can Pool the Version form git of ros and build the whole ros  System form source.
Or you have a working backup.

Thanks. I compiled the source ros-indigo-desktop. Now, I need to build robot perception packages. For example, how could I build a package vision_opencv (https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv) from source?
