Q:

Compiler errors while making rgbdslam on Nvidia Jetson TK1

The previous memory problems while were solved after enabling a swap file on jetson's storage and tried with "catkin_make" command. But again en counted with following errors

A quick google search for "rgbdslam tk1" turns up https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2/issues/17 and http://answers.ros.org/question/221799/rgbdslam_v2-on-tegra-tk1-build-error/ ; both of which look relevant.

A:

There's a conflict between the OpenGL type definitions. If you have some c++ skills, your best course of action would be to try and remove the 3D gui from the code. I can elaborate on this, if you are interested.
