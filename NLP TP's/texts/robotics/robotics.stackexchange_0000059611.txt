Q:

libyaml-cpp error when using catkin_make on gscam

I ran across a problem, probably because I deleted one day some files related to libyaml. Anyway when I try to build gscam (ros package) I get this error.
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libyaml-cpp.so.0.2, needed by /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libcamera_calibration_parsers.so, not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/libcamera_calibration_parsers.so: undefined reference to `YAML::Node::begin() const'

And I can't find where I could get it. I mean, I've downloaded 0.3 version from code google yaml-cpp and it works for my purposes. Any help?

A:

You should be able to reinstall the yaml-cpp development library on Ubuntu by running:
On precise:
sudo apt-get install --reinstall yaml-cpp

On newer versions of Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install --reinstall libyaml-cpp-dev

I'm not sure I understand your comment; what do you mean by "I don't have any libyaml-cpp libraries avalaible there" ? Can you copy and paste the EXACT error message?

Are you running ROS on Ubuntu or a different OS?
Comment by delta785 on 2014-05-25:
Ubuntu 12.04
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-05-25:
Ah, ok. I'm using a newer version of Ubuntu. It looks like the appropriate package on 12.04 is yaml-cpp . If you still can't find it, check to make sure that the ROS repository is still enabled.
