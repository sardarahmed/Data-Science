Q:

ROS Noetic installation issues!

Hello, i tried to install ROS on my Raspberry pi 3 and have problems with setting up the key. I am running Ubuntu server 20.04 on my Raspberry pi.
i control it via ssh connection from my laptop.
and try to install ros by following the roswiki instructions.
i can't get very far because i can't set up the key in step 1.3 correctly.
I am using the following line:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
and get this output:
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
I am not very familiar with these stuff. Do I need to pre-install something for this to work? or is the key on the roswiki homepage not up to date?
thank you in advance!

Please double-check:

is curl installed on the server? If I'm not mistaken, it does not come preinstalled on (at least) the server version of 20.04. You should receive a Command not found error a few lines above the error you show)
If it is installed, are you behind a proxy? Does just the first part (i.e. only the curl -s http...) command print a key to the command line? If not, what error do you get?

A:

I solved the problem,
it turned out that the ip address of my Raspberry pi was the truble maker. i have created a static ip for my ssh connection. Now every thing is working.
But thanks for your reply.
