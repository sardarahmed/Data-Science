Q:

is the Jet Robot kit from Servocity discontinued?

It shows as out of stock and they can't give me a date when it will be in stock

Wouldn't asking Servocity directly be a more efficient way to get this information?

A:

You may get all the parts yourself, as they are all available. Also the Excel spreadsheet parts list is available. (It's in the software package from Nvidia.) Perhaps Nvidia has their $199 special on the TX1 still going, I'm not sure. (Look on the developer's forum, page 1 for Jetson TX1.) For added vision capability, try the Intel Real sense D435 depth camera. JetsonHacks is just now posting scripts in Github to install the drivers on the TX1. This camera may be as capable as the Stereolabs Zed camera, at less than half the price.
