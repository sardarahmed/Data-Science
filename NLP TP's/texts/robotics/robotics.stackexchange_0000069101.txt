Q:

Roslaunch using different port?

I'm attempting to use roslaunch to start nodes on 2 different machines. Apparently roslaunch will create it's own ssh connection - I have my network configured so that I use public / private keys for authentication, but I've set the ssh to be done over a different port. How would I configure my roslaunch file to do the same? (i.e. port 42 instead of 22)
Current file:
<launch>
  <machine name="bbb" address="bbb -p 4242" user="sparky"/>
  <machine name="spearmint" address="localhost" default="true" />
  ....
</launch>

Obviously that's the wrong syntax, but that's what I'm trying to achieve.
For reference, I can run ssh sparky@bbb -p 4242 and connect just fine.

A:

there is an example from ros-comm on how to do this, basically it is an undocumented parameter ssh-port you need to set on  like:
<launch>
    <machine name="machine-1" default="true" address="foo.bar.com" ros-root="/home/user/ros/ros/" user="whoami" ssh-port="4242" />
</launch>
