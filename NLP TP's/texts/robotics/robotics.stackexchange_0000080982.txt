A:

Update (2020-03-12): there appears to be work ongoing to add RHEL/Fedora support to ros_buildfarm et al. See the list of merged PRs.

I don't think anyone can guarantee that it'll work, but it should be possible to do a source build. I'm not sure whether the Fedora RPMs that get build are usable on a RHEL system.
See #q216929 and #q119716 for related questions. At least the first one was successful in installing the core packages.

Thanks @Gvdhoorn for quick reply. I also thinking of taking a Windows 10 Machine and make it dual booting with Ubunto 16.04 LTS. Please let me know if this is right approach  to Install ROS and RViz.

16.04 will definitely work, as it's a supported distribution.
