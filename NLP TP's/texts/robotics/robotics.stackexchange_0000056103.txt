Q:

Android / Rocon_app_manager pairing error

When trying to pair an Android device with the Rocon_app_manager as per [1], the 'Robot Remocon' Android app does find the robot when pressing 'Add a robot > Scan the local network', but when pressing 'select' it tries to connect but displays an error:
org.ros.exception.RosRuntimeException: timed out waiting for a gateway_info publication

I tried on different networks (university-wide and at home through a local router) and two different pc's and android devices. There is at least some communication as there's a different error when the rocon_app_platform hasn't been started on the pc.
I tried to look up where this error originates but I am quite hopeless. Does anyone have an idea of how to solve this?

Any chance that some of the problems here are due to the fact that you are using android devices that have multiple interfaces? You can diagnose by checking rostopic list and rosservice list to see if the connections are there. rostopic info on an android topic will show strange ip's.

This error is quite vague sorry....we have simplified communications hugely getting ready for indigo with better error feedback (yet to be released though).

A:

I think probably your ROS_IP/ROS_HOSTNAME/ROS_MASTER_URI are not correctly set on the turtlebot for multi-device-pc communication. Some information on the roswiki and the turtlebot wiki.
The 'dumb' error message unfortunately is a late hydro regression I have yet to fix - it used to actually provide a hint to make sure you have your ROS_IP/ROS_HOSTNAME set.

You're right - setting ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME in .bashrc works, per the instructions in the turtlebot wiki. Still not very stable, sometimes it connects, sometimes on retry, sometimes on app restart.

Still quite beta, occasionally state gets confused if something goes awry. We're working hard to upgrade/stabilise the android environment better for igloo.
