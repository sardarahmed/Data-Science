Q:

nested metapackages

Hi All,
I know that packages can be nested using metapackages so that a metapackage can contain multiple packages. Is it possible to nest metapackages (metapackages within a metapackage).

Are you referring to 'logical nesting' (ie: making one metapkg depend on another) or to actually placing the files & directories of a metapkg (and other pkgs) inside another metapkg directory)?

A:

I mean, sure. But I don't exactly understand why this is desirable. The idea of a metapackage is simply to make ROS distribution easier.
One such metapackage within a metapackage is ros-desktop-full: this has a LOT of packages within it, including many metapackages. It's function is to simply lower the work load for installation.
