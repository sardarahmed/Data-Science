Q:

Kinect camera not found with ROS

Installed Ubuntu 12 and Fuerte first and couldn't get the Kinect camera to show up. Reinstalled Ubuntu 11.10 and Electric and stepped line by line through installation guide and installed it by using sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect.
When I tried to 'rosrun openni_launch openni.launch' I got permission errors from usblib (can't remember the exact error). Found the 55-primesense-usb.rules file and the permissions looked ok.
Tried to then install all the OpenNI drivers directly from the website http://www.pansenti.com/wordpress/?page_id=1740 and now when I run 'rosrun openni...' I get this error. After running through all those steps when I run the example I get this.
/x86-Release$ sudo ./Sample-Players

One or more of the following nodes could not be enumerated:
I'm doing everything by the book and nothing is working. Any suggestions? I've been trying for 4 hours to get this camera working and am at my wits end.
