Q:

KDL for a 21 dof robot

Hi,
I work with the kdl, but i dont know how to determine the angle Limits.
Someone an idea?
Thanks

A:

Your question has very limited information on what you actually want to achieve (calculate forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, wrenches, twists etc.?). I´d recommend looking at (and possible using) MoveIt!. It provides advanced capabilities or motion planning, but also basic kinematics functionality described here. If you´re more interested in the low level control side of things, this cartesian controller implementation for ros_control demonstrates how you can read a URDF file and initialize KDL objects from it.
As you might have noted, the recommended first step is to generate a URDF model or your robot, as this makes use of KDL (and many other tools in the ROS ecosystem) much easier.

hi thanks for you answer. I find that https://github.com/kouretes/NAOKinematics. I want to calculate the center of mass from the robot.
int main(){
NAOKinematics nkin;
nkin2.calculateCoMChain((Frames)HEAD, (Frames)(FR_BASE_T+CHAIN_HEAD), HEAD_SIZE, m);
sumc=nkin2;
summass=m;

return 0;

}
Something is wrong. Someone an idea?
