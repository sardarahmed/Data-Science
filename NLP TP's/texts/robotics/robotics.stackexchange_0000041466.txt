Q:

Android_tutorials_image_transport Error inflating class org.ros.android.views.RosImageView

I'm trying to run the image_transport tutorial under android_core on a Galaxy Nexus which is connected to my Ubuntu.
When I run it, I'm getting the following error from Logcat:
FATAL EXCEPTION: main
E/AndroidRuntime( 5149): java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{org.ros.android.android_tutorial_image_transport/org.ros.android.android_tutorial_image_transport.MainActivity}: android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line #6: Error inflating class org.ros.android.views.RosImageView
I deleted the line from main.xml that read android:src="@drawable/icon" and the same error still occured.
I have not modified the source code in MainActivity.java. Is there some revision that should be done?
Thanks!

Hello,
I think I had the same issue. Just change the org.ros.android.views...lines to org.ros.android.view...without s!
Best Regards
