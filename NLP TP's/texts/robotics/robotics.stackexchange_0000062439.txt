Q:

use some functions of move_base

Hello! Is there any way to use only some functions of move_base? I want to use in my node only the global costmap created with move_base and nothing else (no planners)

A:

You can either create a costmap object yourself in your code or if you want the one from move_base, just start it as normal and don't call the planners. move_base won't do anything if you don't send it anything.

This is correct. Check out the costmap2d_node in the costmap package.
