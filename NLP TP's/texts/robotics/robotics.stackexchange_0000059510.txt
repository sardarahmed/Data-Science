Q:

synch problem with chrony and xenomai

Hi all,
I've just discovered that to synchronize messages across different physical machines I have to use Chrony. Everithing is fine....except when I actually run my real robot, which is actuated with the xenomai module. Since then, the clock starts delaying very quickly. As soon as I stop the task, the clock starts re-synch. Note that the daemon is active all the time.
I think that xenomai is kind of excluding chrony o something like that, I'm not familiar with RT-linux unfortunately

A:

After painfull procedures...I solved the problem.
I recompiled the kernel with the CONFIG_HZ = 100 and that solved the problem for me.
Hope that it helps.
