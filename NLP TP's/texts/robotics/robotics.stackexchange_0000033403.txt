Q:

Two difference implementations of IRSensor code?

Hi everyone,
I was working with IRSensor and  i found out that there are two different implementations of the IRSensors. The IRSensor available in diamondback, most of the part is commented out while the one available on-line in the site https://kforge.ros.org/gazebo/trac/browser/server/sensors/ir/IRSensor.cc?rev=a9373a6e19be81f4efe2729c71ec7964d5c1131d have no line commented out. I didn't understand the problem why the lines are commented out.
Any help will be appreciated.
Regards,

A:

The difference between the IR Sensor present in Diamondback is the new version of IRSensor specified in the site.
