Q:

Building a node

Hello, very basic question.
I just wrote some nodes to (hopefully) turn a servo with a joystick. I used catkin_create_pkg to make a package in the src folder. Then I used catkin_make to make the package. I made a directory in there, and pasted my two python codes. I used catkin_make again. These are the same steps as in the publisher tutorial. when I try to run my nodes, I get
: No such file or directory

Is there a step I'm missing. I know in the ros tutorials there is alot in the Creating a ROS msg and srv tutorial I didn't understand.
Thanks for the help.
The exact command I ran is
donni@donni-VirtualBox:~/catkin_ws/src/pi_servo/scripts$ rosrun pi_servo servo_listener.py
: No such file or directory

When I run grep
donni@donni-VirtualBox:~$ env|grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=indigo
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros

I don't think that looks wrong.

It will help us if you edit your question to add the exact command you ran, and the result of env|grep ROS command to see what's going on.

A:

ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

This indicates sourcing devel/setup.bash did not work as expected. ROS_PACKAGE_PATH must contain the path of your catkin workspace in order for your executables to be found by ROS.
I just added a passage to the create catkin workspace tutorial.
To make sure your workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script, make sure ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable includes the directory you're in.

    $ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
    /home/youruser/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

So in your case, I suggest to make sure you build and source properly. You can try again by removing the built artifact (see Cleaning up) and run catkin_make, and source the setup.
