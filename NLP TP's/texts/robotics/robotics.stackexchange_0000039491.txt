Q:

"Have you called init_node()?"

hi everyone, when I'm trying to do the tutorial in http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29 , I have a problem when I try to execute

rosrun beginner_tutorials talker.py

The error message is :
luigi@luigi-pc:~/ros_workspace/beginner_tutorials$ rosrun beginner_tutorials talker.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/luigi/ros_workspace/beginner_tutorials/nodes/talker.py", line 11, in <module>
    str = "hello world %s"%rospy.get_time()
  File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/src/rospy/rostime.py", line 222, in get_time
    return Time.now().to_sec()
  File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/src/rospy/rostime.py", line 150, in now
    raise rospy.exceptions.ROSInitException("time is not initialized. Have you called init_node()?")
rospy.exceptions.ROSInitException: time is not initialized. Have you called init_node()?

Anyone Can help me??
Thank you in advance
Luigi

Can you please post your python code? It at least differs somehow since the error comes in line 11 and not in line 9 which should be the str = ... line when you directly copy-pasted the code from the tutorial.

in that page you can find the used code :)

A:

You need to indent the while loop so that it becomes part of the function talker. Right now, the while loop is getting executed, and talker is never called.
