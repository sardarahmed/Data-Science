Q:

Unable to build nav2d_karto

When trying to build nav2d_karto using catkin_make, I get the following error:
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:

I can't seem to fix it.  Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?
Thanks.

How do you install csparse?  That seems to be just some script file.

Try install libcsparse  relative package.
