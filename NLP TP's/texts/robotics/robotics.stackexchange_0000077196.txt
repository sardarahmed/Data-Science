Q:

VLP16 - ROS Indigo- Velodyne poll() timeout Issue

Hi folks,
I am pretty new with ROS and looking for some guidance. I got this error every time I tried to start the ROS.
rosrun velodyne_driver velodyne_node _model:=VLP16
[ERROR] [1478568624.623678583]: unknown Velodyne LIDAR model: VLP16
[ INFO] [1478568624.624140559]: Velodyne HDL-VLP16 rotating at 600 RPM

[ WARN] [1478568625.626775354]: Velodyne poll() timeout

[ WARN] [1478568626.627907945]: Velodyne poll() timeout
I have installed the ROS Indigo Velodyne driver by following this step http://answers.ros.org/question/226594/how-do-i-build-ros-vlp16-velodyne-driver-for-indigo-using-catkin/
Any advise how to resolve this initial problem ? I've ran roscore and tried to do rosrun.
My goal is to read the real time data from VLP16 using rviz
Any advise will be highly appreciated.

A:

That error suggests that you're running the released Indigo binary Velodyne driver, not the latest sources from github.
If you followed those directions to clone and build the sources, did you forget the final source devel/setup.bash step?

I have the same problem. I cloned the latest source from github as http://answers.ros.org/question/226594/how-do-i-build-ros-vlp16-velodyne-driver-for-indigo-using-catkin/ shows. I also applied source devel/setup.bash. However, it is still Velodyne poll() timeout
