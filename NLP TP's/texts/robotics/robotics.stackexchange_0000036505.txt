Q:

How to program a series of different tasks? SMACH?

Hi,
I am wondering how I can learn my robot to execute a series of tasks.
Like this example:
First:  move to a position on map
Second: say something
Third:  move to docking station
I came across SMACH and built a state machine.
But when it comes to actions and sending goals like PoseWithCovarianceStamped, I don't know how to do it. I looked through some tutorials but it didn't help me a lot.
Also the switching between C++ and Python is a bit annoying to me, because I practically programme C++ and don't really know Python.
Is it an acceptable solution to just have a main.cpp and use "if" clauses as a "state machine"?
So I can programme all in C++?
Help appreciated :)

A:

You can certainly program state machines in C++. There are several techniques, amd it is not particularly hard.
Smach is a nice interface, however. It provides several tools you are unlikely to come up with on your own.

Thanks, I think I will stick with C++, besides you know a good tutorial where sending a goal in a state machine in python is shown ;)

After a decade I still have the same question: Is there any example with which we can call our .cpp scripts from the SMACH .py file?
