Q:

XV11 Laser Capabilities

Hi, I'm really interested on the XV11 laser for an art project using arduino.
Unfortunately I don't have enough money to buy the sensor and experiment with it without knowing a bit more what this sensor is capable of it. My main focus would be to track raindrops. Would it "see" a raindrop falling next to it ? Maybe it's a too small resolution, or to fast to be able to see it?
I don't have a really idea of its capacities.
If someone could answer my question, that would be really appreciate it.
Thank You
Romain

A:

I seriously doubt you'd be able to track raindrops with most of the commercially available lidar sensors.
The neato lidar has a maximum range of about 3-4 meters, full 360-degree coverage, an angular resolution of around 1 reading per degree, and an update rate of 5Hz.
