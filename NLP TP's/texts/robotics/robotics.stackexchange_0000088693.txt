Q:

ROS2 on windows for controlling robot

I'm doing a project which is to use ros2 on windows 10 to control a ur5 robot.
Is there anyone know how to do this? or any resource on that ?
Thanks!

Is the project's goal specifically to use Windows 10 to control the robot, or ROS to control it? What dictates the Windows 10 choice?

Thanks for answering, the goal is to use ros2 on windows to control robot.

A:

You can have a look at https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control
This uses ROS 2 and has all the things setup for Windows as well (i.e. visibility macros etc). I used it for controlling an ABB robot with it. I believe with a correct hardware interface towards the UR5, you should be able to reuse some of the code.
