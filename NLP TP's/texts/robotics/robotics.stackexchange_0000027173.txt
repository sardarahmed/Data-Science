Q:

 is missed?

When I built the source file from GUI Overlay tutorial, there was a fetal error that <gazebo/gui/GuiPlugin.hh> is missed. So I looked into the include directory and found there was no such a header file. I searched on the Internet and hardly got anything, so I am stuck here and need some help. I installed gazebo-4.0 from the source code a few days ago and still was not familar with it. Did I missed something when I installed it? Or something else? Thanks.

Thanks.  https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/default/examples/plugins/gui_overlay_plugin_spawn/     Here's the link of the source code. After the cmake step, I met the following errors when make it--fatal error: gazebo/gui/GuiPlugin.hh: No such file or directory.--  In the path /usr/local/include/gazebo4.0/gazebo, there exist other header files like <gui.hh> and <Plugin.hh> but no <GuiPlugin.hh>.   So I have no idea what has gone wrong.

Here's the total console output:

A:

The GuiPlugin.hh header file is not present in gazebo4 and earlier. You must use the default branch (or gazebo_5.* or later branches once they are created).

So how can I use  "Overlay Gui" in earlier version of gazebo (e.g. gazebo2)

You can't, you must upgrade Gazebo.
