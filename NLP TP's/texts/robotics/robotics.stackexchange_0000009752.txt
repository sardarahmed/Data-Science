Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-desktop-full

I want to install ROS on my Xubuntu 16.04, Xenial Xerus. I have followed the ROS's site instruction: http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Ubuntu, and did the following: First, setup my sources.list:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
Second, set up keys:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 0xB01FA116
Then, make sure my package is up-to-date: 
sudo apt-get update
Last, try to install ROS jade:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-desktop-full
And get this error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-desktop-full
Where did I go wrong, and how can I get ROS (any version is ok) running on my Xubuntu 16.04?

A:

On the page you indicated http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Ubuntu it is said that it only support 14.04 14.10 and 15.04, therefore i don't think it is available yet for the 16.04 version.
Either try to see via auto-completion if there is any other version available,
or compile from source. 
You will have better answers on the ros site http://answers.ros.org/question/226098/ros-on-ubuntu-xenial-1604/
