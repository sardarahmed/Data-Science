Q:

openni2_tracker problems

Hi !
I am currently using ROS Groovy and I recently decided to move from openNI 1.5 to openNI 2.
I tried openni2_tracker and managed to make it work, but I have two problems :

The node needs to find data file ./Nite2/s.dat, so it's not working if you don't run it from a specific directory. Which means you can not put it in a launch file you want to run from anywhere on your system. Is it a normal thing ?

It's not possible to launch the script openni2.launch (with all sensor driver) and openni2_tracker at the same time. It's a problem for me because I would like to run other nodes using the camera data at the same time than openni2_tracker.

Does someone have some information ?
Thanks,
Caroline

A:

Go into the folder where Nite2/s.dat.
In my case I installed nite2 in my home directory, so I ran openni2_tracker node from inside this path:
~/NiTE-2.0.0/Redist/
Therefore, s.dat is locate here "~/NiTE-2.0.0/Redist/NiTE2/s.dat"
Openni2_tracker will work in that way. It's kinda lame, though. There's gotta be a better way to have the ros node understand the path. The path is allegedly provided through the CMakelist of the openni2_tracker package, but that does not seem to fully work. You must figure how to provide the path in correctly in your CMakeList file.
