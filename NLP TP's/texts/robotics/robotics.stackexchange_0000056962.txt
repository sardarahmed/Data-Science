Q:

Package paths with spaces don't work with rosbash?

The location of the package I am working in is
/host/Users/Mark\ Won/Documents/School\ Work/College/Junior/Junior\ 2nd\ Semester/CSE\ 468/workspace/tutorials

I have added the following to my ~/.bashrc
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/host/Users/Mark\ Won/Documents/School\ Work/College/Junior/Junior\ 2nd\ Semester/CSE\ 468/workspace/

However, when I try to run roscd tutorials, I get the following error:
bash: cd: /host/Users/MarkWon/Documents/SchoolWork/College/Junior/Junior: No such file or directory

Does anyone know how to get package paths with spaces in the name to comply with the rosbash suite?
---------UPDATE: I've tried adding the following to my ~/.bashrc, but to no avail:-------
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:"/host/Users/Mark\ Won/Documents/School\ Work/College/Junior/Junior\ 2nd\ Semester/CSE\ 468/workspace/"

and
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:"/host/Users/Mark Won/Documents/School Work/College/Junior/Junior 2nd Semester/CSE 468/workspace/"

and
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:"\"/host/Users/Mark Won/Documents/School Work/College/Junior/Junior 2nd Semester/CSE 468/workspace/\""

and
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:"/host/Users/Mark\\ Won/Documents/School Work/College/Junior/Junior\\ 2nd\\ Semester/CSE\\ 468/workspace/"

and
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/host/Users/Mark\\ Won/Documents/School Work/College/Junior/Junior\\ 2nd\\ Semester/CSE\\ 468/workspace/

A:

Paths with spaces need to be enclosed in double quotes (ie: ").
This is more a bash related question than a ROS one. See fi:

bash: passing paths with spaces as parameters?
BASH Script to cd to directory with spaces in pathname

on stackoverflow.

I've tried added quotes and taking out the backslash. I've also tried quotes with the backslash. Nothing seems to be working. I think the issue is that I'm not calling the cd command, ROS is. Therefore, I don't have any control over whether or not the path is quoted when cd is called.

I agree; I don't think rosbash properly support paths with spaces. In general, spaces in path names are strongly discouraged on Linux.
