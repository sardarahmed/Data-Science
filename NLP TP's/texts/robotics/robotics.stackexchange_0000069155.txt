Q:

Wiki tutorials indexing with FullSearchWithDescriptionsCS macro

I m creating documentation and tutorials for siemens_cp1616 package (GSoC project). Currently I have 7 tutorial pages that were created in almost random order. I use FullSearchWithDescriptionsCS macro to search and list all tutorials on siemens_cp1616/Tutorials page. It works, it generates the list but I would like to change the order of the list to be more logical and start with introduction, not with runtime tutorial. Is it possible to re-define order in tutorial indexing? Or am I missing some option on the wiki page or header?
Thanks in advance

A:

I would recommend using the TutorialChain macro:
http://wiki.ros.org/WikiMacros#TutorialChain
This macro was designed to replace the full search one, since that macro makes the wiki really slow. Even if there is not a logical order to your tutorials, just order them arbitrarily but statically so that the wiki loads faster.
