Q:

Support for older ROS distros in 12.04

Hi,
I know that currently only Fuerte is support in Ubuntu 12.04.  Will there ever be support for Electric and the older ROS distributions in 12.04 and beyond for people who want to run legacy code?
Thank you,
Jenny

Thanks, I wanted to know this too. I had problems with electric on 12.04 and switched back too 11.10.

A:

There are no plans for supporting older distributions on Ubuntu 12.04 or later. See rep-0003.
