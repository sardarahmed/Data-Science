Q:

Where is documentation for Actionlib Client?

The tutorial page for Actionlib Client has two references to further documentation, both of which have a broken link.

"Documentation of all the constructor
options and available functions can be
found in the ROSLIB.ActionClient
docs."
"The ROSLIB.Goal docs describe all the
constructor options and functions
available. "

Can anyone tell me where this documentation is?  And, how do I raise this sort of issue?

That link refers specifically to the javascript (roslibjs) actionlib client. If you're not looking for the javascript version, you may want to start with the actionlib page: http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib

A:

I don't know where to find the source docs.
The path for that wiki page (near the top) provides a link to the package: http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs ; the package page has links for the package's source code and their issue tracker. Given that this is a javascript package, you should probably have a look at their readme and report broken links on their issue tracker.
