Q:

roslaunch multiple turtlebots

Hi everyone, has anyone successfully run roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal launch for multiple turtlebots (3 to be exactly) while using the concept of one ROS MASTER and the other robots point to the address of the Master.
if so, please guide me as i am having trouble with this. how to run bringup commands in this network would be great.
Thank you

A:

In my experience it is difficult (impossible?) to create launch files to run multiple Turtlebots within one ROS instance.  I suggest that you check out rocon:

I haven't used it, but it is intended to solve this problem.

nsprague, there is a network system call multimaster_fkie and it seem to be the easiest right now. I'll update once i have implented it fully. thanks

I do not have much progress with the guide. I kept having issues with bringup during the process.
