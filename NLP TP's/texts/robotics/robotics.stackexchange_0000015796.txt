Q:

RS-232/422, UART, usb sensor access code same?

Is the method to access all the sensors with RS-232/422, uart and usb sensors can be done in same way? Or by converting rs-232 to usb, uart to usb can they be programmed in same as usb from linux?
For example this link provides way to access such port from linux command line and program. so my question is considering i have another serial device/sensor with same type of connetivity i.e serial would it not be same to access that device in same method as described in above link.

A:

The RS232 and RS432 should be handled identically since they are both merely physical standards (voltage, cabling, etc) and appear to the computer identically. They would even have the same device under Linux.
The USB is just slightly different when opening it up because it has a different device associated with it. Once you've found that for your system, it should be the same.
They all should act like serial connections.
