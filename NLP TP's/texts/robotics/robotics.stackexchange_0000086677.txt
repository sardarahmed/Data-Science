Q:

kobuki_mgs missing

I wanted to use the "IntelROSProject" and followed the guidelines.
But upon running the command "catkin_make", I got an error saying that cmake failed.
Reason was that he was missing kobuki_msgs, but the github page for the package that depends on it (ros_moving_object) says that it should be part of the full desktop install.
And in fact, I could find the kobuki_msgs...
Why aren't they part anymore of the full desktop install?

kobuki_msgs has never been part of any of the official ROS metapackages (neither any of the other kobuki_* packages). See REP-142.

From your issue on the ros_moving_object tracker I gather that you've cloned the kobuki_msgs from source and added them to your workspace.
I would recommend you follow the workflow shown in #q252478 whenever you try to build something from sources in ROS. rosdep is the tool that installs dependencies of packages for you, and in this case would have installed the binary kobuki_msgs package for you, as it is actually released for ROS Kinetic.

Oh, okay, my bad. Thanks for your hint!
But the way they listeted the needed packages, it seemed to me kobuki is also part of the full install...

I don't know why the readme makes it appear that kobuki_msgs is part of desktop_full. That would be something to ask Intel.
