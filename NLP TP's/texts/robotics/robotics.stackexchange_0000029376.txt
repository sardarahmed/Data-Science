Q:

[GUI] [Err] [MeshManager.cc:131] Invalid mesh filename extension

I'm getting the following errors using a simple sdf file that I get from the tutorial of animating a box:
[ruby $(which gz) sim-1] [GUI] [Err] [MeshManager.cc:131] Invalid mesh filename extension[tutorial/worlds/__default__]
[ruby $(which gz) sim-1] [GUI] [Err] [SceneManager.cc:1027] Actor skin mesh [tutorial/worlds/__default__] not found.

I'm using Gazebo garden on ubuntu 22.04.

A:

It seems not possible to use collada object in modern gazebo, unless it has a mesh with skeletal animation. instead you can use trajectory follower.
