Q:

Where is sdformat.org?

As linked from bitbucket, the documentation for sdformat is at http://sdformat.org, but that website seems down or non-existent. Is there another site to use?

I've never heard of that website, I don't know who added it to bitbucket but I think the link should be removed.

It's Nate's commit, apparently.

I had also noticed that the link was dead. I finally read this page on the Gazebo wiki and it answered pretty well to all my questions:
