Q:

Creating an RVIZ plugin to add semantic information to a map

I repeat this question posted 2 years ago, except that we need a plugin for a different purpose. We plan to create a graphical editor to add semantic information to 2D/3D maps, and a RViz plugin could be the ideal solution. Rqt plugins look great for simple interfaces, but we need the fully-fledged 3D interface that RViz provides. So it's still not recommended to make a RViz plugins?
I already started a   plugin, reusing rqt_nav_view to load a 2D map, but I'm afraid that make it fully 3D will be a lot of development effort, and I don't have enough time.
Thanks for any input!

A:

The RViz plugin API is stable now, and it's possible to write display plugins for specialized data types. I maintain a number of custom rviz plugins as part of my day job.
The rviz wiki page has tutorials for writing new display types, panels and tools.
