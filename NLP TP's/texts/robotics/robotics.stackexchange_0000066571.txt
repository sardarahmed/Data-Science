Q:

Is there geometry_msgs/Twist for rosserial

Hi All,
I am trying to make a driver for my custom Arduino robot and I would like to have the Arduino parse the twist messages itself and publish /odom messages itself. Is this feasible? I looked through the rosserial packages and I couldn't find any of the geometry messages, so any ideas?
Thanks,
luketheduke

A:

Yes. You can #include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h> directly into the Arduino code. Just be sure to put #include <ros.h> first, before any other #include statements.
