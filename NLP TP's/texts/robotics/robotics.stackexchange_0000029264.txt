Q:

Is there a way to use model's name as a reference for a plugin's topic? (Citadel or Fortress)

For example,  the current section:
     <sensor name='gpu_lidar' type='gpu_lidar'>
      <always_on>1</always_on>
      <visualize>true</visualize>
      <topic>ultrasonic0</topic>
      <update_rate>20</update_rate>

This doesn't have to be gpu_lidar only. It can be joint_controller, battery or any plugin type.
So, the topic will be displaying as /ultrasonic0, right?
So, is there a way to do like this:
/<model_name_from_file>/ultrasonic0?
I wanted to duplicate robots in future along with rename set as true in the same world so I was hoping like
/robot_00/ultrasonic0
/robot_01/ultrasonic0
/robot_02/ultrasonic0
And so on.
Is this possible? I tried <namespace> and <topic></topic> but it end up an absolute path which I don't want that.

A:

This is currently not supported. Your best bet is to remove <topic> and use the topic generated by default. Feel free to open an issue requesting the feature,  or better yet, a PR with an implementation :).

Okay, thank you so much for your time! Do you have any clue for me to start somewhere so I can PR if it's acceptable to Gazebo team?
