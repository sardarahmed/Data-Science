"Markers turned white" points to problems with your TF tree. Have you changed anything there? Can you double check that RViz still has the correct Fixed Frame configured?

Thanks a lot for your comment. I'm sure nothing has changed in the TF tree and I double checked that the correct Fixed Frame is configured. Immediately before the update everything was working fine but soon after without me changing anything at all the two visualization markers turned white.

I get the same problem. The visualization_marker message has the correct color values but all markers appear white.

I opened a new issue on RViz Github. Let's see what they say. Maybe this is intended behaviour.

Thanks a lot gaya. I guess we are having the exact same problem. Let's hope someone answers in Rviz Github.

If either of you have a reproducible example, I'd appreciate it if you could share it on the issue https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/1120. That will help me debug the problem.

I have the same problem. Did any of you find a solution? It would be extremely helpful for my thesis.

A:

This issue has been solved by @William in the following pull request: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/pull/1132.
It should take effect with the next sync, I guess anytime within the next couple of weeks.
