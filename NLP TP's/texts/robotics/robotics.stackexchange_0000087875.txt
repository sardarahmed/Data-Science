Q:

Cannot connect to Jackal clear path from my laptop

I have successfully connected the jackal robot to a wifi network by ssh ing to the jackal through an ethernet cable, so my robot has a working internet connection. When I follow the steps outlined in the clear path tutorial at this link https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/jackal/network.html and then do rostopic list, I get the error message: "ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!"

A:

You need your computer to be able to connect to Jackalâ€™s ROS master. This means you need to set the jackal as ROS master. In order to do this you need to do the following:
Open a new terminal on your machine and enter:
ifconfig

Here you need to find your Ethernet IP. It will be something like 192.168.x.x 
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 09:00:12:90:e3:e5  
      inet addr:192.168.1.29 Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
      inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe70:e3f5/64 Scope:Link
      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
      RX packets:54071 errors:1 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
      TX packets:48515 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
      RX bytes:22009423 (20.9 MiB)  TX bytes:25690847 (24.5 MiB)
      Interrupt:10 Base address:0xd020 

Then in an ssh-ed window type ifconfig again and find the Ethernet IP which is also 192.168.y.y
Then open a new terminal on your machine and type:
sudo nano /etc/hosts

Here you need add the jackal IP and the host name for the jackal. For example like :
192.168.y.y cpr-jackal-0001

where you replace .y.y with what you got with ifconfig in the ssh-ed window. After this you can create a simple bash script called remote-jackal.sh with only the following lines inside:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://cpr-jackal-0001:11311  # Jackal's hostname
export ROS_IP=192.168.x.x                           # Your laptop's ethernet IP address

where you replace .x.x with what you got with ifconfig in the first step.
Now for every terminal that you want to use/connect with the jackal's ROS master you just need to source the remote-jackal.sh file you created like:
source remote-jackal.sh

After this when you type rostopic list your should get the published topics.
