Q:

Obstacle insertion in map

I have a sensor to detect obstacles that are not visible. I want my robot to avoid them because they are dangerous despite not being visible.
I have a path planning working with my laser sensor. So, I imagine that the best way of avoiding this potentially harmful points is by introducing them in the obstacle map.
Is it possible?
How can I do it and prevent the laser clearing them in the map?
Thank you
EDIT:
I am using navigation package with my TOF camera to implement an AMCL and a path planning. The problem I have is that I need to add invisible obstacles (they are recognised by a radio frequency system). My path planning is working properly right now, but I need to introduce more information in the map.

What kind of sensor is it?

I have explained it above

A:

Have you checked out the ROS Navigation?  It looks as if you can develop a SLAM map using this set of packages.

I'm not sure how your radio frequency sensor works, but if it gives you the position of the obstacles that it senses, you should be able to publish that information to the appropriate topic.  As long as you have the right message format, you should be good.  I would examine other sensor nodes.
