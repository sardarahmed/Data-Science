Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: raw disparity?

I can see the disparity.
( rosrun image_view disparity_view image:=/camera/depth/disparity )
But I know the disparity added colors.
I need raw disparity(?) or not color-disparity.
How can I get the raw disparity?

A:

The disparity is visualized using color to show the user.  The value of the pixels in the image if you iterate across it is the disparity value.
