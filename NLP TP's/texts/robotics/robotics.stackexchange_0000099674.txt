Q:

vscode: rospy import error

The env I am using is ROS Noetic and VS Code along with Pylance.

launching rospy nodes is working fine
importing rospy gives a squiggle error in VSCode.
Also, python syntax is not being highlighted properly. Along with that, I am also not getting auto-complete options.

I think it should be a configuration issue, but I don't know where and what I have to configure to resolve this.
Any help would be appreciated.

A:

Hello there,
You have to add 2 python paths into your settings.json file into VS Code.
These are the paths:
The first path is for all packages of your local workspace and the second is for the global package.
{
    "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
        "/home/<pc-name>/<ws-name>/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages",
        "/opt/ros/noetic/lib/python3/dist-packages"
    ]
}

If you are using CPP then you have to add the path in the c_cpp_properties.json file.
The location of setting and c_cpp_properties JSON files will be :
 "~/<work-space>/devel/include"

Just to note for Pycharm Users: if you are using Pycharm then give this both paths by following these steps:

Go to settings.
Project: src > Project Structure > On the right-hand side click on  + Add Content Root and locate both paths.

Try this you will be able to solve your problem and if you have any issues feel free to drop a comment.
