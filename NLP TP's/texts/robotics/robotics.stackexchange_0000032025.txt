Q:

laser_driver stack missing in pr2-desktop install

It looks like the laser_drivers stack is missing from the pr2-desktop dimaondback install. Is this intentional?
Here is what I did -

$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-pr2-desktop 

When I tried to roscd to hokuyo_node, I got an error.

$ roscd hokuyo_node 
roscd: No such package 'hokuyo_node'

Installing the laser_drivers stack fixed the problem:

$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-laser-drivers

A:

See REP 108 for which stacks are included in which variants. Note that, as specified there, laser_drivers is not included in pr2-desktop or any of the variants that it extends.
