Q:

ROS and Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal working?

Hello, for testing of my previous question http://answers.ros.org/question/44632/ i wanted to test Ubuntu 12.10 and ROS.
Is it yet possible to use this combination?
With the installation sources
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

i get the error:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

and with changing it to:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu quantal main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

apt-get cant find the ROS Packages.

So is the combination of Ubuntu 12.10 and ROS possible or am i doing something wrong?
Thanks in advance.

apt-get should not be able to find any ROS packages as 12.10 is not supported.  The entries you added to your sources.list will not entirely work.  AFAIK you'll have to install from source.  The build error you are getting can likely be fixed with sudo apt-get install liblog4cxx10-dev
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-09-30:
@jarvisshultz please make an answer out of your comment. It's the correct answer.
Comment by sem on 2012-09-30:
installing of the liblog4cxx10-dev helped for this error, but now i am: Could NOT find BZip2 (missing: BZIP2_LIBRARIES BZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR)
but the bzip2 is already installed
Comment by dornhege on 2012-10-01:
For building from source, you will usually also need the -dev packages, not just the library.

A:

Ubuntu 12.10 is not officially supported by ROS Fuerte (or any version of ROS).  Which means that you will have to install from source.  In order to compile ROS, your system will need many libraries that ROS is dependent on.  I mentioned liblog4cxx10-dev and @dornhege mentioned libbz2-dev. It seems that the source install instructions for Ubuntu are a bit disorganized (IMO) the dependencies aren't really mentioned until section 1.7.  The Debian source install page, for example, lists the dependencies right at the top of the page.
Regardless, installing all of the dependencies mentioned in either of these locations should help you continue on with the building process.
