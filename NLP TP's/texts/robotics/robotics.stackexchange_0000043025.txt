Q:

Faulty (Future) /tf Time in Gazebo?

A possible bug in tf or gazebo:
I'm using the default pr2 gazebo simulator, and simulating base and tilting laser as well as the cameras.
When I look at the tf more closely, the time associated with this link is in the future by about a half second:
/base_link --> /base_laser_link
... when compared to /clock itself and other tf links (e.g. to the tilting laser or the cameras)
Has anyone noticed tf publishing a link labelled in the future - specifically in gazebo simulation?

A:

The tf tree of the robot is not published by gazebo directly but by the robot_state_publisher node. Have a look at its wiki page. It explicitly states that all static transforms are future dated by 0.5 seconds. See here and here for an explanation of the reasons for future-dating transforms.
