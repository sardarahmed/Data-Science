Q:

Why can't ros_pcl detect my pcl headers when building?

I am using raspberry pi and building pcl_ros from source.
I already downloaded, built and installed pcl. I believe it is installed, since there are cmake files in /usr/local/share/pcl-1.7
When I run the command:
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --pkg pcl_ros --install-space /opt/ros/indigo

I get the following error message:
/home/pi/catkin_ws/src/perception_pcl/pcl_ros/src/pcl_ros/surface/convex_hull.cpp:40:37: fatal error: pcl/surface/convex_hull.h: No such file or directory
CMakeFiles/pcl_ros_features.dir/build.make:54: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/pcl_ros_features.dir/src/pcl_ros/features/feature.cpp.o' failed

I also know that ~/pcl-pcl-1.7.2/ surface/include/pcl/surface/convex_hull.h exists.
I followed these instructions when building pcl from source.
Anyone know what might cause this problem?

You probably have not fully built pcl because of some missing dependencies. Check if surface/convex_hull.h exist in /usr/local/include/pcl-1.7/pcl. Can you paste the output of the "cmake .." call

A:

I just copied the missing .h file from ~/pcl-pcl-1.7.2/ to /usr/local/include/pcl-1.7/pcl/surface/convex_hull.h
Apparently just one file was not installed. Might be a mistake in the pcl source. Not sure what else might have caused it.

Nice! You should open a ticket in PCL (https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl)
