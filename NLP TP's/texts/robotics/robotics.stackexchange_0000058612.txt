Q:

How to create soft objects (wheel tires) in gazebo?

Hello,
I am currently trying to model a wheeled robot (pioneer3at) in Gazebo. The problem I face is that it strangely bounces of its wheels whenever it gets an impulse. So I thought the problem might be that the wheels are too hard and do not absorb any energy.
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/Using_A_URDF_In_Gazebo#The_.3Cgazebo.3E_Element
Following the link above I added a kp-tag to the according gazebo-tag in my URDF, but whatever value I use, it just causes the wheel to be ignored completely for collisions. (It will just fall through the floor)
What is the correct way to describe collision properties in Gazebo?
Update:
I now had a closer look at the Husky-Bot, which seems quite similar to the Pioneer. In Gazebo, it shows none of the mentioned problems. The definition of the Husky-Wheels seems pretty similar to what I did:
<gazebo reference="${fb}_${lr}_wheel">
    <mu1 value="1.0"/>
    <mu2 value="1.0"/>
    <kp  value="10000000.0" />
    <kd  value="1.0" />
    <fdir1 value="1 0 0"/>
    <material>Gazebo/Grey</material>
    <turnGravityOff>false</turnGravityOff>
</gazebo>

So how comes it is not bouncing around like my Pioneer?

A:

We had good success on our robots with not really modeling softness, but using the default parameters. You should be able to find a few skidsteering robots for inspiration regarding parameters (the husky_simulator package should provide a working example). I found that some parameters do not appear to work correctly though (see Gazebo Q/A).
There also is a  user group for Pioneer robots. IÂ´d be surprised if there is not AT3 available for simulation, as this robot is in pretty widespread use still.
/edit: Regarding parameters of the husky: Performance is a function of the complete model, so also the masses, inertias and ratios between them for the full model. It might be the case that the husky has better properties there. Note that issues could be reduced by altering some simulation parameters (timestep etc.) or model parameters (changing masses, getting rid of details etc.).

Thank you, I will have a look at these packages! I am currently using the p3at-model from p2os_urdf, which works in Gazebo besides the mentioned problems.
