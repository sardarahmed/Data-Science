Q:

Creating 3D grid map for amcl

Hi guys,
I am doing a known mapping by using amcl, and I wish to improve my map by making it into 3d and view it inside rviz.
Here's my map image. (in .pgm)

Is there any software in ubuntu that can draw it in 3D?
Image file need to be compatible with yaml file in order to run map_server to be used by amcl.
I am using fuerte.
Thank you so much.
Post update
This is a 3D map I draw by using google SketchUp on window. I have exported it into Collada file.
How do I visualize it in rviz with respect to the /map frame?

A:

Not sure there is anything like this readily available. What you could do (or what is the first quick way of doing it that comes to my mind ;) ) is write a small node that subscribes to your map and outputs a MarkerArray with a CubeList of all areas in the map that are occupied, so you have one scaled cube per occupied grid cell.
/edit: As you already have a 3D object representation of your environment, things are much easier. I recommend making your COLLADA file part of a ROS package and then following the instructions for publishing your mesh as a Marker here.
