Q:

WSL: Couldn't rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

I am following the beginner rosnode tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes.
The environment is Windows 10 / WSL. When I enter command rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node after running "roscore", I get the following error:
wn-003% rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display
zsh: abort (core dumped)  rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

Are there any solutions to this? Thanks.

Do you have an X server running and have you setup everything to use that X server?
Please note that ROS on Ubuntu on WSL on Windows 10 is not a supported configuration, so you're bound to run into issues.

Have you restarted the X server? The X servers for Windows I know are not services, nor part of "the system", but regular programs. So you'll have to start them manually.

Yes, I restarted the X server. But failed.

Is the DISPLAY variable also set?
Comment by shmpwk on 2019-02-08:
yes in .bashrc file, there is
export DISPLAY=:0

Well, as I wrote in my answer, this is not a supported configuration. Although it can work -- as I've seen many people set things up this way, and I've done it myself -- there is no guarantee.
