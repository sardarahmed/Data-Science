Q:

how can I submit my own ros package to github

I know it would be  a silly question.
Here is the thing. I have my own ros package in Ubuntu running on VMware on windows, and now  I want to run this package on Ubuntu, which is another system of my pc.
I think it should be pretty convenient for me to submit this package to github on VMware, and then turn to Ubuntu system, clone it and catkin_make from github.
Is there any guidline and any details should be taken care of? Thanks

A:

This is really a github question, not specific to ROS.
Just create a github repository in the normal way. Then you can use it for ROS packages or anything else you want.
