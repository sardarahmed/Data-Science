Hi everyone

How have you specified the start and goal position?

Try https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/husky/HuskyMove.html. It is a husky tutorial which proves a nice way to move from start to goal.

I have already followed this but helps nothing

A:

Gazebo should automatically publish laser scan data. Use $  rostopic list to find the name of that topic.
The simplest way would be to publish your wheel velocity to /cmd_vel and by trial and error check if you have reached your goal.
If this is very inefficient for you then I would suggest you look at the ROS Navigation stack. Classify your problem according to the tools the stack offers.

Thanks for answering my questions.
This is already working using /cmd_vel and using teleop. Basically I want to move my robot between two fixed points set by me. before this how I can check that my laser is working? It's just showing blue light in the simulator.

Do you want your robot to move in straight line between start to goal? Probably not.
 $ rostopic list

This command will display the name of the topic where Gazebo is publishing laser scan data. Subscribe it in a node. Use it to guide your robot by giving appropriate /cmd_vel values.

If you are not able to achieve your targets this way, then read this: Navigation
It has a steep learning curve.

I have mounted laser on my diff drive robot using hokuyo model. But I am unable to find the laser scanner node. I have read various forums that suggest me to make URDF of my robot and then use necessary plugins after that I have to set the node in RVIZ. I am confused with RVIZ why should we use that
