Q:

Joint world pose for each step of simulation

How would I obtain joint world pose data for each step in a simulation? I have a model plugin that can get the joint position before the simulation is run, but how do I get the joint world pose for each simulation step?
Thanks!

A:

If you have a function that gets the joint world pose before simulation i assume you are calling it in the Load() function of the plugin. You can then, in the same way, call your function in the OnUpdate() loop. By my understanding, that gets called every iteration.
You can find a more detailed description at:
