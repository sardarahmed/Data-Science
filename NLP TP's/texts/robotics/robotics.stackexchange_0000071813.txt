Q:

Can I reset RVIZ via topic?

Hey!
Is there a way to reset rviz via topic/service/...? I'd like to clear all objects e.g. when restarting a node and since the display is not at my desk, I'd like to be able to just send a trigger to reset instead of having to use a mouse.

A:

Not that I'm aware of, but you could possible write an rviz plugin that allowed you to do so.
