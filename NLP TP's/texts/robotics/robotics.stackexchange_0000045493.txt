A:

sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pr2-gui

The name of the debian package to install is always:
ros-<distro>-<stack>

Note that underscores are replaced by dashes in the stack name, i.e. the  debian package for the stack pr2_gui is ros-fuerte-pr2-gui.
To find the stack of a package, have a look at the wiki. In your case: http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_dashboard
