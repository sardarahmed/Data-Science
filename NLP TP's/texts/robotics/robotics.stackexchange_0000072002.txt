Q:

How can I control my Kobuki base Turtlebot with a NI myRIO?

I am a part of a senior design group that is charged with building an autonomous robot that has to be controlled by the NI myRIO. The goal of the project is to make the robot follow a person or object using a Kinect sensor. Everything has to be coded in LabVIEW, as well. How can I achieve connectivity between all three devices? Is it even possible to make the Kobuki base and the myRIO communicate with each other?

A:

For general integration with a larger ROS application, there is an (experimental) package for Labview that allows semi-transparent communication between a ROS node graph and Labview: ROSforLabview, created by Chris Rogers from Tufts University (Sine page here: Introducing LabVIEW and the Robot Operating System (ROS)).
For just communicating with the base, you'll probably have to follow the suggestion of @nickw.
