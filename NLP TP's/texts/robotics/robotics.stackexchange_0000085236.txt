Q:

could not find ruby, failed to process package orgen

This is my error:
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.5/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:148 (message):
  Could NOT find Ruby (missing: RUBY_INCLUDE_DIR RUBY_LIBRARY
  RUBY_CONFIG_INCLUDE_DIR) (found version "2.3.0")

<== Failed to process package 'orogen': 
  Command '['/home/robot/ws/underlay_isolated/install_isolated/env.sh', 'cmake', '/home/robot/ws/underlay_isolated/src/orocos/orocos_toolchain/orogen', '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/robot/ws/underlay_isolated/install_isolated', '-G', 'Unix Makefiles']' returned non-zero exit status 1

Reproduce this error by running:

Command failed, exiting.
