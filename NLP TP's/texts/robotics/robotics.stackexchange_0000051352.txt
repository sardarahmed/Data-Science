Q:

Gazebo Plugin Tutorial error

I am running Gazebo with ROS Electric on Ubuntu 10.04 and I have been trying to do the Plugin tutorial.
At Step 6, after trying roslaunch, I get the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [gazebo/gui]: Cannot locate node of type [gui] in package [gazebo]

Please double check your world file or glx support from your gpu / gpu driver, thank you.

The world file I am using is straight from the tutorial. My graphics card is an ATI Radeon HD 4200, which is on Gazebo's list of working cards. Could this be an issue with paths?

Not for your ROS version but a possible solution:
