Could you please update your question to clearly indicate which command you run on which computer / robot? Right now this is rather ambiguous.

A:

This is a wild guest, given the lack of info, but:
You also need to export either ROS_HOSTNAME or ROS_IP variables:
export ROS_IP=172.x.x.x

ROS_HOSTNAME requires, that the provided hostname is resolvable, so ROS_IP, is your choice for simple setup.
