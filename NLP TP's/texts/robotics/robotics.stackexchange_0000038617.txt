Q:

rectify image in your package

Dear All,
I have a package which has 2 image_info and camera topics:
nh_.param("input_image_topic", input_image_topic_, std::string("/camera"));
nh_.param("input_camera_info_topic", input_camera_info_topic_, std::string("/camera_info"));
I am wondering if there is a way to rectify images in my package.
I donot want to use the image_proc in a launch file. I need the rectify images to be called in my package to do some processing.
cheers,
Eddi

A:

The whole architecture of ROS makes the assumption that one wants to distribute the computation on several nodes dedicated to a particular subproblem that needs to be solved. Therefore, there is no direct API in image_proc to rectify an image. If performance is a problem, you may run both your algorithm and the rectification in the same process using nodelets.
Doing things differently and trying to extract C++ API from ROS nodes is not a good idea. If you really want to do so, then ROS is probably not the right tool for you and you should directly use OpenCV API.
