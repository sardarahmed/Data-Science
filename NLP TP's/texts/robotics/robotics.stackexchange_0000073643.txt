Q:

Problem with catkin_make

Hello!
When I want to use catkin_make I get the next problem.
pi@cctronics ~/catkin_ws $ catkin_make
ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.topological_order import topological_order" failed: No module named tool_detection
Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTOHNPATH

I don't know how to fix the issue.
Currently I'm using ROS Indigo on Raspberry Pi.
