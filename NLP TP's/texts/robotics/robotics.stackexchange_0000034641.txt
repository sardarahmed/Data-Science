Q:

How to gain access to newly created point cloud map

After successfully running my point cloud data through the laser assembler node and creating a composite map how do I gain access to this new map and send it to different nodes?

A:

The laser_assembler node publishes to the assembled_cloud topic. You can then subscribe to this topic to gain access to the data in a ROS node. The assembled_cloud message is of the type sensor_msgs/PointCloud. You could use something like:
cloud_sub_ = node_.subscribe<sensor_msgs::PointCloud> ("/assembled_cloud", 100, &MyNode::CloudCallback, this);
