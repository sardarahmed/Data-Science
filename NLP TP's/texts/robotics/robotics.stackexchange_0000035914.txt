Q:

ROS site downs very often or it is just me?

This might not involve with technical issue. However, I have a lot of problem in getting in the ROS website may be 3 times already in this month. Is it just me? or everyone encounter this problem?
I ask this because if it's just me, I then can find the cause and solve the problem myself.

While the recent outages have been annoying, they are not common. That was the first lengthy down time I can recall in several years. The wiki mirrors (see below) were created as an immediate response.

A:

There were some technical problems (a power outage, among others) recently. For these cases there are read-only mirrors of the wiki:

http://ros.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/roswiki/
http://ros.jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/roswiki/
http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/
...and more at http://www.ros.org/wiki/Mirrors

Best bookmark them now!

Not that I know, but maybe it's halfway working through Google cache.
