Q:

rosjava for javafx no maven (Kinetic)

Hi,
I am working on a research project and have been tasked with creating a gui app in java/javafx that will connect to the lab robot (ros master) over the network. We want to be able to have a publisher and subscriber running in the app. We will be subscribing to a topic for image messages and will be publishing to a topic for custom messages to provide steering information.
I have not been able to get maven integrated into my javafx project on IntelliJ Idea and am thinking that I should just use the source repository and use jars and the files I need.
Does anyone know if it is possible for me to use ros messages without using maven or if I have to use maven can someone point me towards how to do it, i have been searching online for a solution but haven't found one.

Hi @pulkitgupta1217,
I'd use maven to download the artifacts directly.
In the repositories section of the pom file, add the following:
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>rosjava_mvn</id>
        <name>Public Rosjava repository</name>
        <url>https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_mvn_repo/raw/master</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
      <id>jcenter</id>
      <url>https://jcenter.bintray.com/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

That will point to rosjava_mvn_repo. Then, in the dependencies section, add the dependencies you need, e.g.:
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.ros.rosjava_core</groupId>
        <artifactId>rosjava</artifactId>
        <version>[0.3, 0.4)</version>
    </dependency>

This can include any message artifact you need.
Hope it helps!

Did that work for you @pulkitgupta1217?
Comment by pulkitgupta1217 on 2018-08-23:
yes, I was able to add the rosjava packages to a new maven project and migrate my code over, I am still unsure as to how i would integrate with a javafx application as it appears that the nodes much be launched from a main method but with a javafx application class and controller class, I am unsure.
