Q:

Need help with passing parameters to a launch file

I would like to over ride rtabmap parameters on a rosrun command line....I want to used the unaltered rtabmap launch file overriding some of the Grid parameters. Can this be done from the command line? If not is there a way to call rtabmap with include from another launch file and do this I do not want to cop and modify the launch file.  I can not seem to get any solution on this. Thank you for your time.
The below code does not work.
roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" depth_topic:=/zed/depth/depth_registered frame_id:=base_frame approx_sync:=false visual_odometry:=false odom_topic:=/zed/odom camera_info_topic:=/zed/rgb/camera_info rgb_topic:=/zed/rgb/image_rect_color  rtabmapviz:=false Grid/MaxGroundAngle:=45.0 Grid/MaxObstacleHeight:=2.0

I tried setting inside a launch file:
<!-- rosparam command = "load" file = "$(find my_package)/example.yaml" / -->  
<param name = "/rtabmap/Mem/IncrementalMemory" type = "bool" value = "false" />  
<param name = "/Mem/IncrementalMemory" type = "bool" value = "false" /> 
      
<include file="$(find rtabmap_ros)/launch/rtabmap.launch"/>

<param name = "/rtabmap/Mem/IncrementalMemory" type = "bool" value = "false" />  
<param name = "/Mem/IncrementalMemory" type = "bool" value = "false" /> 

But the rtabmap keeps setting values to true.
[ INFO] [1529896284.763605800]: Setting RTAB-Map parameter "Mem/IncrementalMemory"="true"
[ INFO] [1529896284.764360510]: Setting RTAB-Map parameter "Mem/InitWMWithAllNodes"="false"

even though
rosparam list | grep Incr

/Mem/IncrementalMemory
/rtabmap/Kp/IncrementalDictionary
/rtabmap/Kp/IncrementalFlann
/rtabmap/Mem/IncrementalMemory
/rtabmap/rtabmap/Mem/IncrementalMemory

What does this mean?

it does not alter the values of the parameters ....

A:

It seams that you are setting parameters in the wrong name-space for your node.
If you look at launch file of rtabmap you can see that parameters are set depending on localization parameter and it seams they should not be used by the user.
Also you are setting bool parameters, but they are actually strings.

thanks .... what I was looking for I just found rtabmap.ini  still don't know how to over ride parameters   on input but this works for me.   Yes I totally missed the the fact that the Men parameters was controlled by localization ....
