Q:

smach subscriber publisher

hello everyone,
I'm new to the ROS society, and I have some questions.
I've made a simple state machine,publisher and subscriber as was shown in the tutorials, but how can I use date obtained from the subscriber(e.g a simple String) to make a transition between two states in the state machine??
greetings

A:

A smach state is simply a Python class (see the example in this tutorial), so you can add a normal ROS subscriber to that class if you want.
This means, in the subscriber callback you can store the message data (a string in your case) as a class memeber, and in the execute callback you can make decisions about outcomes based on tis class member.

Thanks for the answer Wim, but I still have some problems with it( Maybe its because I'm a rookie) . Could you(if it is not too much) give a small example??
