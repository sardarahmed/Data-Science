Q:

How to install gtest in OS X mountain lion

Hi
I have been struggling to get ROS to install properly in OS X Mountain Lion. I am very close, but I need to install gtest. This i cannot get it to do automatically through brew because Google does not recommend installing a pre-compiled copy of gtest as per their wiki.
Can anyone guide me through how to install gtest from the source so i can get on with the ROS installation? Seems to be the only hickup I have left.
Best regards

I actually tried that but it did not work for me :/
I get the following when I run rosdep install -a
No available formula for gtest (dependency of pcl)

Pay attention to the "UPDATE" on that question. Did you try adding the formula manually?

Edit: I am sorry, I placed the .rb file in the wrong folder, I had it in Taps/ros-fuerte instead of Formula. I realized this when I was installing the newest PLC from http://pointclouds.org/ and followed their toturial.  It installed now. Thank you mate!
