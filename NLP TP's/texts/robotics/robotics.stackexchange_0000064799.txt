Q:

some details about using ueye_cam to drive my 1221LE-C camera

hi, it's my first time to use programs on ROS. I have tried to understand it, but it need more time.
I followed the build instructions on http://wiki.ros.org/ueye_cam, but I have no idea about how to do next. All I need is to get camera_topic and camera_info i.e. the two topics in Published Topics. But I don't know how. So, could anyone tell me how to run to get the two topics.
There is no problems in building, and I use ROS indigo on Ubuntu14.4.

A:

To inspect the data coming from camera topic / camera_info in terminal:

rostopic echo /camera/image_raw (WARNING: possibly will generate a lot of raw ASCII)
rostopic echo /camera/camera_info

To visualize the data from camera: rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw
To subscribe to the camera:
