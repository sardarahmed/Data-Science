Q:

(rviz:12054): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_drawable_get_depth: assertion `GDK_IS_DRAWABLE (drawable)' failed

Hi there,
after updating ubuntu maverick to natty, I get the following error running rviz
rosrun rviz rviz
(rviz:12054): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_drawable_get_size: assertion `GDK_IS_DRAWABLE  (drawable)' failed
(rviz:12054): Gdk-CRITICAL **: IA__gdk_drawable_get_depth: assertion `GDK_IS_DRAWABLE  (drawable)' failed
I am using KDE and assume my gtk-settings were wrong. Do I miss a package or something? I would appreciate any help! Thanks!

A:

Hi,
I can answer that myself. I had to add
export GTK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1
to my environment variables. Though the message still appears, rvis starts as usual.
Cheers, Tobias
