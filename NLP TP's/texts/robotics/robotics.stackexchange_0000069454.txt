Q:

"rosbag record -a" in C++?

I want to implement a node which is able to start recording every topic. It should record everything like the command line rosbag record -a. is there a possibility to use that command or something similar in a node which is implemented in c++?

I want to use Rosbag but there are only examples like http://docs.ros.org/diamondback/api/rosbag/html/c++/
but i wanted to record every topic and not single messages.
the reason why i wanted to start that with a node was that it should start in the right moment

You can call rosbag with parameters from launch file. See question http://answers.ros.org/question/52773/record-with-rosbag-from-launch-file/

thank you
thats a great idea.

A:

Rosbag has an API: http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Code%20API
That is the best way to use it instead of using system commands.

It looks like it is up to the user to continuously monitor for new topics and subscribe to all of them as they appear, substantially re-implementing rosbag record -a.

Well, that is what he says he wants!
