Q:

Where should I put configuration files?

Where should I put node configuration files? (e.g. a knowledge base)
What is the "ROS way" to access these files?
I would like to have a node that reads some files in a folder at startup... files that can be modifyed by users.
or there is a better "ROS way" to do that sort of things?
edit:
I'm only interested in wich is the best location where I can put configuration files and wich is the best way to get the path to these files...

A:

Usually what works well is providing the file URI as a ROS parameter that you can set via the rosrun command line or in a launch file. You can pair this with putting the actual files in a foo_bringup or foo_config package, which contains the config (and launch) files. In the launch files you can then use the <param name='config_folder' value='$(find_package foo_bringup)/config' /> syntax.
There was a question a while back about downloading additional files for a package (and then finding these from within a node), which might contain useful information for you: http://answers.ros.org/question/109761/where-to-download-extra-files-needed-at-runtime/
