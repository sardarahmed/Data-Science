Q:

unknown_publisher: Ignoring transform for child_frame_id "link1"

Hello. Currently I want to simulate random robot, which not provide ROS related files at all, to ROS environment.
Most of manufacturer provide 3D cad file(.step).
And I do some search to make urdf file from cad file, finally I figure it out THERE IS a add-in function in solidworks(wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter).
However, unfortunately, it shows error message as below.
[ERROR] [1542609991.430536188]: Ignoring transform for child_frame_id "link1" from authority "unknown_publisher" because of a nan value in the transform (-nan -nan -nan) (-nan -nan -nan -nan)

[ERROR] [1542609991.430645045]: Ignoring transform for child_frame_id "link1" from authority "unknown_publisher" because of an invalid quaternion in the transform (-nan -nan -nan -nan)

[ERROR] [1542609991.430670924]: Ignoring transform for child_frame_id "link2" from authority "unknown_publisher" because of a nan value in the transform (-nan -nan -nan) (-nan -nan -nan -nan)

Here is the code that I made.
OS: ubuntu 16.04 LTS(VMware)

Any comments will helpful.

that is correct, you need to check the correct axis in the joint.

A:

First issue: some of the joints don't have their axis property set correctly (this one for instance). That would be something to check and fix.

@gvdhoorn, It works. It makes matrix all zero? So it didn't work?

Sometimes the SolidWorks2URDF plugin has difficulty detecting the correct mates/axis. It's not a perfect plugin (but what software is).

I'm getting a similar error and it would be worth mentioning what you mean by axis property being correctly set? How should it be set? For instance here is my code. What's going wrong here https://github.com/rsankhye97/gantry_urdf/tree/main/src/end_effector_slide_gantry
