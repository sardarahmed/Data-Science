Q:

Wired android connection

Hi everyone!
I've got a small mobile robot with raspberry pi computer on board. I need to use some sensors and apparently most of them are included in a standard android phone. Therefore i've been thinking of mounting such device on the robot. I know there is quite easy way to communicate phone and ros-enabled computer via wifi, but since the phone will be an integral part of the robot i'd prefer faster and more reliable cable connection. So here comes my question:
Is there a possibility to connect android to the ros master with usb cable?

A:

Some phones can act as usb host, in this way you can for instance use a mouse on your phone. Perhaps it is also possible to connect a usb ethernet adapter.
Or run ROS on the phone and use an arduino with android ADK interface:
