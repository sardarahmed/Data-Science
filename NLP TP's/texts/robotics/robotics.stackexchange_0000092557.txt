Q:

I am able to convert pre-trained models(pfe.onnx and rpn.onnx) into tensorrt. But I am not able to convert our models into tensorrt

ONNX IR version: 0.0.4
Opset version: 9
Producer name: pytorch
Producer version: 1.1
Domain:
Model version: 0
Doc string: While parsing node number 16 [Squeeze -> “175”]: ERROR: /home/erisuser/p4sw/sw/gpgpu/MachineLearning/DIT/release/5.0/parsers/onnxOpenSource/builtin_op_importers.cpp:1570 In function importSqueeze: [8] Assertion failed: axis != BATCH_DIM ERROR: failed to parse onnx file  Please address the issue. Thanks in advance

@Siva, did you manage to find a solution to your problem ?

A:

Thank you for your question.
Unfortunately, if you want to use your own model, it is the out of the scope of Autoware.
You can ask a question regarding TensorRT here.

Thanks for the reply. May I know which version of Pytorch you used to convert to onnx models and tensorrt version?

Please check the readme.md for TensorRT version.

Any version of pytorch which can convert to onnx model should be fine.

Got it,
I am using Pytorch 1.1,tensorrt 5.0(as you mentioned in readme), ONNX IR version:0.0.4, Opset version:9 and converted to onnx. Now i can able to convert rpn.onnx to rpn.trt but i am not able to convert pfe.onnx to pfe.trt.
The error is like below:
While parsing node number 16 [Squeeze -> “175”]: ERROR: /home/erisuser/p4sw/sw/gpgpu/MachineLearning/DIT/release/5.0/parsers/onnxOpenSource/builtin_op_importers.cpp:1570 In function importSqueeze: [8] Assertion failed: axis != BATCH_DIM ERROR: failed to parse onnx file
