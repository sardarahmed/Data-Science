Q:

Why there is no timestamp field in sensor_msgs?

Hi !
I've been looking into ROS2 sensor_msgs definitions for example sensor_msgs::msg::Imu and I see that there is no field for timestamp !
What is the reason for that ? In practice any measurement information must / could be associated with a timestamp for obvious reasons.
Even if IMUs typically don't provide built-int timestamps, the driver node who reads the IMU and publishes the IMU messages could attach a timestamp to the information.
It would make so many thing so much thing easier....
thanks,
g

A:

In sensor_msgs::msg::Imu there is std_msgs/Header header.
Inside  std_msgs/Header there is include builtin_interfaces/Time stamp which is time stamp.
The definition about  Imu you can see there.
And the  definition about  Header you can see there.
