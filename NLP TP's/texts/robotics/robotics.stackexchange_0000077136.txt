Q:

TIAGo installation kinetic - packages names?

I am using ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic. At wiki there is just information for ROS indigo. Any idea what is with two packages which are not listed at kinetic anymore?
andrejpan@t530:~/ros/workspace/tiago_ws$ sudo apt-get install git python-rosinstall ros-kinetic-desktop-full python-catkin-tools ros-kinetic-joint-state-controller ros-kinetic-twist-mux ros-kinetic-ompl ros-kinetic-controller-manager ros-kinetic-moveit-ros-move-group ros-kinetic-moveit-ros-planning-interface ros-kinetic-moveit-simple-controller-manager ros-kinetic-moveit-planners-ompl ros-kinetic-joy ros-kinetic-joy-teleop ros-kinetic-teleop-tools ros-kinetic-control-toolbox ros-kinetic-sound-play ros-kinetic-navigation ros-kinetic-eband-local-planner ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan ros-kinetic-ddynamic-reconfigure-python ros-kinetic-openslam-gmapping ros-kinetic-gmapping

A:

Looking at (for instance) wiki/tiago_description, those packages are not released for anything but Indigo. The wiki instructions you link to also specifically only mention Indigo.
As to eband-local-planner and ddynamic-reconfigure-python: looking at status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=eband and status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=ddynamic, those packages have not been released into Kinetic. And as far as I can find out, those packages were also not removed (using the 2016-10-04 Kinetic sync announcement fi, search for Removed Packages).
Have you ever been able to install those packages on Kinetic?

I found from people at university that Tiago software works only at Indigo, yeas.
This entry is misleading at wiki. Somebody should remove tabs which shows other than Indigo distributions or make them completely empty.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-11-05:
The version rocker (the 'tabs' you refer to) says this when you click on Kinetic:

Coming soon! Currently supported: indigo.

so it does explicitly tell you which version is supported. Perhaps that could be made more visible. I suggest you report this to PAL.
