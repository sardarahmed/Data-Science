How to install ros-hydro-pr2-desktop or ros-groovy-pr2-desktop on ubuntu 14.04 with ros Indigo? Should I install from source? And if I can install it, can it work correctly on ros indigo? Andy advice?

A:

ROS Hydro and Groovy are not supported on 14.04 See http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html
Most PR2 packages are not yet available in indigo, but a lot of their dependencies are available.

Thanks,tfoote. You said "Most PR2 packages are not yet available in indigo, but a lot of their dependencies are available." ;what do you mean by "not yet available"? Do you mean that PR2 packages will be available in indigo in the near future so that I don't have to install ubuntu precise instead?

Tfoote, is it possible for me to still install PR2 packages and run them (especially the simulator) in indigo now given that their dependencies are available? Can you give me some instructions?

Different projects port forward to new distros at different paces. Larger projects take longer. The PR2 is a larger project and there's still work going on to get everything working on hydro. I do expect it to get indigo support, but not soon.

Guys, any news about the port of PR2 to Indigo?
