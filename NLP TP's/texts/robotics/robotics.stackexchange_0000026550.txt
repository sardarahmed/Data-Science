Q:

Including URI of a jpeg HeightMap file from a directory other than the one given

Hi
I am new to Gazebo, and am stuck on this problem. I couldn't find a way out of this. The solution may be simple, but nothing is working from the top of my mind.
I have created my own jpeg HeightMap file and it is stored in "/home/$userName/Desktop/new_terrain.jpg". I have to use the file from this directory instead of the default one i.e. "GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH/medai/materials/textures/", where all texture files are saved. I already have the HeightMap thing working if I copy new_terrain.jpg file into the default folder.
I exported the the new path using bash command, but it didn't work out. Is there a way we can define the URI such that the xml file extracts the image from the specified directory. Could you suggest a solution?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Where do you store the other texture files such as dirt_diffuse_specular.png, and how are you exporting GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH?
Assuming new_terrain.jpg is on Desktop, and dirt_diffuse_specular.png is the one located in default resource folder, then just export:
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/home/yourusername/Desktop:$GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH

Thanks. That is what I did. As i described in my answer, it works when we mention the URI for new_terrain.jpg, but doesn't work for other texture files like dirt_diffuse_terrain.jpg or dirt_normal.jpg. Anyways, thanks for your help. At least this confirms that I was on the right track.
