Q:

openni_tracker with "Kinect for Windows"

Im trying to start the openni_tracker ( with rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker) and get this error messages:
[ERROR] [1339081305.103259848]: Find user generator failed: This operation is invalid!

and sometimes this error message
[ERROR] [1339081089.497960592]: InitFromXml failed: Got a timeout while waiting for a network command to complete!

With the debugger I got this output:
user@hpcname:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_tracker/bin$ gdb openni_tracker
Reading symbols from /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/openni_tracker/bin/openni_tracker...done.

Update:
At begin, IÂ´ve changed the openni drivers to adapt the "Kinect for Windows" and I found out, that the NITE drivers are not compatible anymore with the openni drivers. That is the reason why I got this openni_tracker errors in my case.
So, I changed my ROS-System again to Electric and removed the adapted openni kinect drivers from my system. There the Kinect for Xbox works fine again with the openni_tracker.
Conclusion for now:
It is possbile to adapt the "K4W" in ROS to get the video data stream. As soon as the openni_tracker should be used there are some compatibility errors under Electric and Fuerte.
Best regards

A:

I suppose a bug in openni. I tested NiViewer. The frist start is ok. Then I exit the NiViewer and start it again. So I get this error: "Open failed: Got a timeout while waiting for a network command to complete!". Sometimes it is possible to restart once, so I get this error after the 3rd start.
After a reboot I have again one or two successful starts.
