Q:

How to use move_base?

Hello ! We team want to develop a UAV recently , and we decide to use move_base in our car's computer . But we meet many questions . Our car equipped a HDL-32E LIDAR , a GPS device . I can understand the structure of Navigation conceptually. structure But we still do not know :

how to use GPS data into the move_base . We plan to input a goal GPS position to the car's computer , but we do not find the interface to input .
Is the map_server necessary ? I think it is not useful to us ?

Could you give me some advices ?
Thank you very much !

A:

Take a look at the http://wiki.ros.org/robot_localization package for integrating GPS. move_base does not perform any sort of localization/estimation itself.
map_server is necessary when you're loading a pre-created map.

We do not need to load a pre-created map , our car aims to run in a wide range , we do not know how to deal with the map_server .

if you don't need it, you don't have to use it. Take a look at 3.3.2 in http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup. The navigation stack is fairly flexible, and you should experiment with your setup in gazebo or similar.
