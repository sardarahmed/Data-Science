Q:

hector_slam_launch

Hello,
I can't clearly understand how to set up a launch file with the base_frame or odom. I get the same error /map doesnt exist.
My purpose is to use the hector_slam (ie hector_mapping) in order to do for the time being the same process as we can see on the video in the hector_slam wiki page. I am only using a hokuyo no imu and no odom. Can someone help me to write the launch file ?
Thanks

A:

did you read http://www.ros.org/wiki/hector_slam/Tutorials/SettingUpForYourRobot ?
you have to follow the instructions under 2 (Use without odom frame). I.e. set both base_frame and odom_frame to your hokuyo/robot frame in the launch file. As a starting point maybe take a look at the given launch files in hector_mapping/launch (if i remember correctly).
maybe try that, and if it still does not work do "rosrun tf view_frames" and check if hector mapping publishes a transform from /map to /yourRobotFrame
