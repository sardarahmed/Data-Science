Q:

ignore "/use_sim_time" parameter

Hi,
is there a way to ignore the "/use_sim_time" parameter in a node, so that it uses the system time instead of clock?
Thanks!
cheers
Jonas

A:

Use ros::WallTime and ros::WallDuration in your node.

Thanks for the hint! I wanted to use a ros::Timer, and your answer pointed me to the createWallTimer method. Jonas
