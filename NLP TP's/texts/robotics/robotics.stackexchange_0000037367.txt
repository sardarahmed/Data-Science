Q:

Is it possible to force current robot position on the map (like the initial_pose of the navigation stack)?

Does hector_slam have the capability to accept the current robot position on the map as input, like the initial_pose topic that the navigation stack subscribes to?

A:

Not at the moment, but I'll look into adding this in the next days. In the meantime, you can control the start pose via the parameters
map_start_x
map_start_y

as described in the parameter description.
Do you want to set the start position and perform a map reset, or do you want to sort of manually correct the pose, keeping the map learned so far?

That's the idea. This feature is an absolute requirement when trying to use SLAM in real use cases according to our experience. One that would be nice is a "relocalize" feature that would try to find the most probable robot position without a priori given a map and laser data.

I see, so ideally one would want to be able to switch off the mapping process and only resume once the initial pose ist set. I'll see if find the time to implement that :)

I'd like to reset  the position while keeping the map. Useful when the robot is moved by the operator, or stopped and restarted at an other place.

+1 for the feature request. It is a must have in our case as well.
