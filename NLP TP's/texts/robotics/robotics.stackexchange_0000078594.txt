Q:

Running mulitple nodes from a Bash file

I have single C++ code which gets the node name from the arguments passed to the main function. This is so that I can use the same code to run multiple nodes.
Is there a way to run multiple nodes in a single script file? Where the name of node is assigned when the main is executed?
rosrun machine sensors sens1 1

This needs to be run for different inputs on different terminals. I tried using a single .sh file, but until the first node exits, the next one isn't started. Is there a way to bypass this issue such that I can run multiple nodes using a single script on multiple terminals?

A:

I think you'll want to look at roslaunch.
See Clearpath Robotics - ROS Tutorials - Launch Files for a starter tutorial.
PS: have you done the ROS tutorials on the wiki?

I have seen roslaunch from the tutorials. But in my case, I am entering the node name at runtime, can i adapt that to roslaunch?

Thank you, I created a launch file with parameters to run the nodes as suggested in the starter tutorial!
