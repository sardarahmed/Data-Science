Simulating BlueROV2 with Gazebo 11 in ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic

Iâ€™m trying to simulate bluerov2 with gazebo 11 in ubuntu 20.04 in ros noetic.
I tried the famous bluerov_ros_playground but it's not working as it should.
My guess is that freefloating_gazebo is not properly installed. The github creator does not provide any installation guide so I'm not sure I did the process correctly. 
When I start the gazebo the bluerov just falls down and never really float.

A:

I am the author of freefloating-gazebo. It is not maintained anymore since many other packages now simulate hydrodynamics and thrusters through Gazebo plugins. They also have much better names than my initial package!
Anyway, the installation is quite straightforward as it is a ROS package. Besides the ROS dependencies, it depends on the Gazebo libs and Eigen headers. Cloning the repo inside a ROS 1 workspace and running catkin build should do the trick.
Note that as we are in 2024 I would suggest simulating the BlueROV2 with ROS 2 and the "new" Gazebo. We use the package here but I am sure there are many other instances of BlueROV2 models with modern Gazebo plugins.
