Q:

Failed to initialize joint_names. Aborting

Hello,
i am using the staubli industrial robot driver. In the past it was working perfectly fine but this morning I got the following error message, when I tried launching the driver:
[ERROR] [1553757665.697264466]: Cannot find user-specified joint names. Tried ROS parameter 'controller_joint_names' and the URDF in 'robot_description'.
[ERROR] [1553757665.697285349]: Failed to initialize joint_names.
[ERROR] [1553757665.698784717]: Cannot find user-specified joint names. Tried ROS parameter 'controller_joint_names' and the URDF in 'robot_description'.
[ERROR] [1553757665.698798510]: Failed to initialize joint_names.  Aborting
[ERROR] [1553757665.699190014]: Cannot find user-specified joint names. Tried ROS parameter 'controller_joint_names' and the URDF in 'robot_description'.
[ERROR] [1553757665.699215342]: Failed to initialize joint_names.  Aborting

I have not really changed any kind of settings nor have I changed the content of the package itself. Any idea, where this error comes from?

This error is printed whenever the industrial_robot client cannot find the required parameters. It could be that your application was in an inconsistent state for some reason. Restarting (especially the master) could resolve such situations.
