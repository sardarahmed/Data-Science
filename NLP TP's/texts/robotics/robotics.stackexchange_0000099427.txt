A:

I am not sure what you mean by "autonomous driving" but Autoware.Auto certainly supports the LGSVL simulator https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/lgsvl.html
and currently autonomous parking https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/avpdemo.html#avpdemo-simulation
We are in the process of adding more general autonomous-driving capabilities to the stack, and those, too, will be testable with the same simulator

Thanks for your reply!  I just now tried to follow the autonomous parking tutorial that you shared, but I was unable to initialize the localization using 2D Pose Esmiate, nothing happened after I drew the green arrow. Do you know why is that so?
