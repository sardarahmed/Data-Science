Q:

How to change thickness of Dynamic Lines?

Hi,
I'm currently using dynamic lines for application, but the lines created are too thin and I'd like to make it thicker. How could I do that?
If not possible, could someone point an alternative?
Thanks!

A:

Ogre, the rendering engine used by Gazebo, only supports 1px wide lines. An alternative would be to use billboards, or very thin cylinders.
You can find an example of billboards being used on Gazebo's source code on the model editor's JointMaker for example. In this case, the billboards are the squares which get attached to both ends of the joint line.

Humm, thank you!  What would be "billboards"?

updated the question pointing to some billboard code.

It worked, thanks! I actually used Billboard Chains. The problem I have now it that the lines are being detected by my GPU laser. Is there a way remove the lines obstruction, but make it still visible by the cameras?

I managed by doing the following:
1 - created a specific mask for the billboard, i.e, GZ_VISIBILITY_BILLBOARD
2 - billboard->setVisibilityMask(GZ_VISIBILITY_BILLBOARD)
3 - changed GPULaser 1st and 2nd viewports to:  (GZ_VISIBILITY_ALL & ~(GZ_VISIBILITY_GUI | GZ_VISIBILITY_SELECTABLE | GZ_VISIBILITY_BILLBOARD))
4 - recompiled gazebo source code.
The question is...is there a way to do it without changing gazebo source code? Form model plugin I think 1st and 2nd viewport are not accessible.

You should be able to use GZ_VISIBILITY_GUI instead of the new mask you created.

RViz also uses billboard lines. I've wondered why they do this instead of using GL_LINES of a specific pixel size. This could be because I'm an old graphics curmudgeon and "lines" makes me think of GL_LINES. I suppose there are good uses for both styles.
