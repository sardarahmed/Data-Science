Q:

Need help for Parallax Eddie Robot!! Got stuck at step 6, ROSMAKE does not work

Hi
I am following the tutorial for Parallax Eddie Robot from Ros all the way up to step 6 and got stuck there. When I first trying to "rosmake" it, it told me this:
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['eddiebotdsdadsadsa']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
After I searched around and changed the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, I got different errors each time.
christopher@christopher-Lenovo-G770:~$ export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/christopher/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/home/christopher/eddiebot-master

Please link to the tutorial you are following.

A:

I just had the same problem and the above answers did not work for me.  However, I followed the directions in the following link and I'm now a little further along.  It looks like you basically have to install each package needed.
