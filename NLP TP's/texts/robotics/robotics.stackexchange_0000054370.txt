Q:

Hydro: installation of openni_kinect

Hi,
My 1st attempt to install ROS Hydro + Kinect.
After:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
It seems that I have to install the driver for openni and kinect and that no compiled package exists for hydro. But this command:
hg clone h t t p s://kforge.ros.org/openni/drivers
tells that I can't go there ... ("Access Denied").
Could someone tell me if I'm wrong (may be, I'm a newbie :) and how to solve this.
Thanks

A:

You should be able to apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-launch (which will include openni-camera, and any other things you need). Drivers for specific hardware are not included in desktop-full.
Kforge is slowly being decommissioned, most ROS code is now on github, and most standard drivers can be found here: https://github.com/ros-drivers
