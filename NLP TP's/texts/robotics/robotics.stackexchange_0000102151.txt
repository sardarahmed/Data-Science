Q:

joy_node how to publish to cmd_vel topic?

So, Ubuntu 20.04 with Noetic installed on robot. Have a motor driver working and can drive the bot with:
"rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel=:/hoverboard_velocity_controller/cmd_vel"
Then installed joy_node, and tested input from game controller. (don't seem to have proportional values from joy sticks - a drama for later) but for now I just need it to publish to /hoverboard_velocity_controller/cmd_vel.
How do I do that?

A:

There's a node called teleop_twist_joy which listens to joy messages and produces Twist messages. Works with a bunch of different joysticks. That joystick problem seems problematic though - maybe fix it before testing with live motors.

OK, so start joy_node- witch reads joystick, then start teleop_twist_joy- witch listen to joy..stick and then add: cmd_vel:=/hoverboard....../cmd_vel. - witch should then publish Twist messages to robot just like : teleop_twist_keyboard ?
I will give a it a go soon. got caught with my pants down.... installed something (with out making a backup) and broke my serial coms to robot. I have borrowed a xbox 360 wired controller to test and see if issue is with my controller or somewhere else.
Thanks for now

spot on! thanks that solved it. ...run joy_node. another terminal run teleop_twist_joy and add cmd:=what ever you want to pipe it to  If you want to change the parametors then add _paramettor after dont forget the dash
