Q:

Cannot save log files when using a ROS enabled plugin

Hi,
I am getting the following warning when shutting down Gazebo (1.8.0) and using ROS enabled plugins in the code, and because of this warning, the log file is not saved:
Warning [gazebo_main.cc:57] escalating to SIGKILL on server

After removing the ROS parts from the plugin, the shutdown works fine, and the log file is also saved.
The plugin is similar to the one from the tutorials.
The warning appears even if I don't use a ROS subscriber. I also tried rosnode->shutdown() at a moment in the code, but without success.
Thanks,
Andrei

A:

Try running gzlog stop and waiting for Gazebo to come unpaused (it'll pause while flushing the log) before shutting down.
