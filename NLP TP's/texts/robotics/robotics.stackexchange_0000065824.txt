Q:

Connect Moveit to a robot

Hi there!
I'm looking for any tutorials or any documents that show how to connect Moveit to a robot. I'm working actually on self-collision robot so I have to work with real robot using what I did on Moveit.
Or any other software instead of Moveit is welcome too :D

Hi,
I have not actually done it yet, but I know of a package which includes such behavior CentroEPiaggio/kuka-lwr. It is an ros + gazebo package for the LWR4 kuka and they seem to have MoveIt working with the real robot. Have a look there.
