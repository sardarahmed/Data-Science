Q:

Install CCNY Computer Vision Stack

I like to install the CCNY Computer Vision Stack.
(Link: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ccny_vision#Installing)
But I have no folder ros/stacks, so where should I install the stack? I only have a folder "ros-workspace" in my home directory. Should i create there an "stacks" folder?
I am new at this topic, so I hope you can help me.

A:

Your folder ~/ros-workspace is a perfect place for any stack. As long as a folder is listed in the environment variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH it can be anywhere on your system and ROS will find all packages inside this folder.
