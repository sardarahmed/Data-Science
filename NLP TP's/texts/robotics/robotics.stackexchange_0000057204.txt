Q:

How can I change code in hector_slam?

Hi all,
Today I have 2 questions. 1º: Where is the file with the Particle filter, or similar, in Hector_SLAM? I suppose that it is connected with hector_mapping but I don´t find the file.
2º: Can I change the number of particles used for Hector_SLAM? In gmapping we use the parameter "particle". If this is possible, where is this data?
Thanks for all.

A:

hector_mapping does not use a particle filter, but pose estimation using fast scanmatching that is accurate enough to not require multiple hypotheses (such as in a rao-blackwellized particle filter approach like gmapping) in many real world applications. Thus, there is no particle count that you could increase. You could take a shot at adding a particle filter implementation on top of hector_mapping of course, but that´s a non-trivial change.

Thanks other time for the answer. Can you tell me where is the file that use this scanmatchig? I want study it. Do a pre-filter not is my solution. Thanks.
