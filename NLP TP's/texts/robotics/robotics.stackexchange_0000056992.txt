Q:

Problems installing p2os on hydro

Hi, I'm new at ROS and I'm trying to install p2os so I can just move my Pioneer. While following the setup tutorial (htt.p://wiki.ros.org/p2os-vanderbilt/Tutorials/Setup), at this step "cd src && git clone htt.p://www.hmt-git.com/p2os.git" i got this message "error: Failed connect to www.hmt-git.com:80; Connection refused while accessing htt.p://www.hmt-git.com/p2os.git/info/refs". Any suggestions?
Thanks for reading.
