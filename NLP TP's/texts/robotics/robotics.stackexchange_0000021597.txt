Q:

IMU Change of reference frame

Im trying to rotate one accelerometer vector from body frame to ned frame, but i cant found what im doing wrong. For now, im using an online dataset that provides me roll, pitch and heading information, where heading is 0 rad when alligned with east axis, not north axis, the dataset also provides accelereration in x, y, z. For making the rotation im using a direct cossine matrix, like this below:

The x axis of the imu is alligned with the movement of the car, the y axis with the lateral acceleration, and z axis with gravity. What im doing is first change the heading angle to get an orientation with respect of north, after this, multiply the DCM with the acceleration [Ax,-Ay,Az] in this order, Ay is negated because the dataset gives me acceleration positive in the left axis.  Im expecting to have the NED acceleration. But the answer seems wrong. The IMU used in this dataset is one oxts rt3003.

A:

The IMU senses deviations from gravity within the inertial frame.
Essentially, IMU measures the specific force $f_b$ given in the base frame as:
$$
f_b = R^{bn}(a_{ii}^n-g^n),
$$
where $g^n$ is the gravity in the navigation frame (NED), $a_{ii}^n$ is the inertial acceleration expressed in NED frame and, finally, $R^{bn}$ is the rotation matrix from NED to the body frame.
Further, it holds that the acceleration we are interested in, that is $a_{nn}^n$ given in the NED frame, can be expressed in relation to $a_{ii}^n$ through the centrifugal and Coriolis terms:
$$
a_{ii}^n=a_{nn}^n + 2\omega_{ie}^n \times v_n^n + \omega_{ie}^n \times \omega_{ie}^n \times p^n.
$$
Usually, both centrifugal and Coriolis contributions can be neglected, thus: $a_{nn}^n \approx a_{ii}^n$.
Thereby, it comes out:
$$
a_{nn}^n=R^{nb}f_b+g^n.
$$
Most likely, you are not considering the contribution of $g^n$ in your transformation above.
I warmly recommend that you refer to Section 2.3 "Using Inertial Sensors for Position
and Orientation Estimation" by M. Kok, et al.
