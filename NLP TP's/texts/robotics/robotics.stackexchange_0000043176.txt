Q:

RGBD-SLAM and STEREO

Hello ROS community,
How to use rgbd-slam with two cameras?
I have read http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam
I run rgbd-slam from command line
"roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch"
and it said: "cannot find kinect device".
What should I put into command line in order to say rgbdslam
reads frames(images) from two cameras, not from kinect device?
Did anyone get success with it?
Also, I have tried to to use bagfiles instead of kinect device to get pre-saved frames(images), however did not get any success.
Does anyone have example of using bagfiles?
My enviroment:
Ubuntu 11.10
ROS electric
2 cameras
Thanks a lot,
Alex

A:

You need to compute a pointcloud from your stereo vision data, then have rgbdslam listen to the 2d image and the cloud. Set the parameters "wide_topic" and "wide_cloud_topic" to listen to the topics where the respective data is published.
The cloud must be dense, i.e. stored in a 2D grid where each point corresponds to one pixel and vice versa.
