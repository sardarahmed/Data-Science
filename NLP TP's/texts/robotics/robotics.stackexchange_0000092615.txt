Q:

Intergrate libcreate into create_autonomy CMakeList change

I cloned libcreate into my workspace and did catkin_make_isolated.
I want to make changes to the create_autonomy package through intergrating libcreate with it.
I was wondering if I need to change anything in the create_autonomy CMakeList or package.xml after building the libcreate
like maybe instead of:
include_directories(
    include
 ${libcreate_INCLUDE_DIRS}
 ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
 )

it's :
include_directories(
  include
  /home/<name>/catkin_ws/src/libcreate/include/create
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

Please be more specific about what you are trying to do. As it is, you haven't really asked a question that people can answer.

@Geoff ok I edited it

A:

No, you don't need to do anything other than put the create_autonomy package in your workspace.
See this document for an explanation of what you are doing (overlaying a package) and how to do it.

Yes, it should prefer the version built from source.

can i have libcreate in another workspace?

You can provided you source the workspaces in the correct order. The more workspaces you chain, the harder it gets to maintain orderings, though.
