Q:

iPhone/iPad .ros configuration directory

Hey, after days of gruesome compiling and recompiling, I was able to build roscpp for the iPhone. I'll try to publish a detailed HowTo soon including finished frameworks for apr, apr-util, log4cxx, expat, boost and ros including armv6/7/i368 architectures.
I feel I'm stuck at a quite trivial problem now, but I don't know how to solve it. After trying to start my first node I get:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::filesystem3::filesystem_error'
what():  boost::filesystem::create_directory: Operation not permitted: "/private/var/mobile/Applications/XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/.ros/"
Which is logical since the iPhone's sandbox doesn't allow writing there. My question would be how to resolve this problem without messing with the roscpp code itself? Do I absolutely need the Configuration Dir? Is there some local/global parameter to influence its location?
Thanks for the help!
Martin

A:

Set the environment variable ROS_HOME to something writable. It currently is .../.ros where you get the error.
