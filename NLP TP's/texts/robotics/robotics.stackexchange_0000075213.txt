Q:

How do i access the camera memory buffer in ueye camera without is_ImageFile()?

I am using a hard float system to do real time image processing using a ueye camera. For each snapshot, i have to save the image and then read it again to start with the image processing task. Is there a way i can copy image data in the camera memory directly to a buffer in my local memory without having to write it in a particular format (bmp/jpeg) and having to read it again? I am not using openCV. I have defined the image struct using openCV format but have removed all openCV dependencies and the code works fine.

A:

Have you looked at the existing packages for ueye cameras? If you can't use one of them directly, the source code may answer some of your questions.
