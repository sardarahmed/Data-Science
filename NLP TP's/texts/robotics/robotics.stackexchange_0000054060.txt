This is not the case for doors and hardly for people. The RoboEarth object recognizer is based on local image features (SURF), which means that it only works with non-deformable textured objects.
I'm not aware of any out-of-the box package for your use case, but there are components. openni_tracker is able to detect persons, opencv should provide methods for recognizing faces, and building a door detector using PCL should be fairly easy. As always, it depends on your setting, i.e. which sensors, which kinds of doors, open/closed, ...
