Q:

[move_base] want to completely follow the global path

Dear all,
I am using move_base for my robot navigation, 
and following the tuning tutorial to adjust my yaml file which used in base_local_planner.
ex: 
pdist_scale:1.0
gdist_scale:0.5
But my local plan path is doesn't not follow the global path completely.

Is there any advice for tunning these parameter?
EX: rotate to direction first.

A:

One possible answer: the scales are NOT [0,1]. Try cranking pdist_scale up to 11.

Thank you, David!  
Set pdist_scale up to 11 works! 
The robot will rotate first, then almost follow the path!
Thanks for your kindly help again :)
