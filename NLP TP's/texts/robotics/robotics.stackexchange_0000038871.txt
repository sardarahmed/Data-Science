Q:

Installation on gentoo

I am trying to install ROS on the latest version of gentoo and it seems there is a mismatch in the way ROS defines package dependencies. Specifically, rosinstall tries to satisfy dependencies by installing "dev-util/gtest" whereas gentoo maintains gtest at "dev-cpp/gtest". It would be very helpful if this issue is resolved soon with high priority. Thanks!

A:

I was able to fix the problem by changing "dev-util/gtest" to "dev-cpp/gtest" in the file ros/rosdep.yaml, originally downloaded by rosinstall. It would be useful if this fix is accepted upstream.
