Q:

How to get a vertice list from a .dae or .mesh file

Is there an easy way to have a vertice list from a .dae or .mesh file for importing into a planning scene as a CollisionObject?
If I use the arm_navigation_msgs::Shape::MESH type, I have to provide a vertice list, but I don't know if I have to read and extract vertices or if there is existing functions/methods for that?
