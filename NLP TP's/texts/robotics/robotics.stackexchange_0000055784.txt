Q:

Building a ROS Package CMake Error

CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:156 (message):
  catkin_package() DEPENDS on 'TinyXML' which must be find_package()-ed
  before.  If it is a catkin package it can be declared as CATKIN_DEPENDS
  instead without find_package()-ing it.

please i need help .

A:

A little more detail about the package you are trying to make would be helpful.
Based on the output it looks like you may have not declared a dependency correctly, or declared TinyXML as a dependency but do not have TinyXML installed or set up correctly.
First, I would look here: http://wiki.ros.org/tinyxml
That will probably solve your problem.
Otherwise, I would take a look here for an overview: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/package.xml
