A:

This looks like a rosbuild package; have you tried downloading it into your rosbuild workspace, running rosmake on it, and then running the launch file as indicated?

Can I use catkin? I have tried downloading it into catkin workspace and running catkin_make:
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/FalkorSystems/falkor_ardrone.git -b hydro-devel
catkin_make
But the package don't install. I'm using hydro version. How can I work with rosbuild?

No, it's a rosbuild package. You can't use catkin with it; you'll have to create a separate rosbuild workspace that is overlaid on top of your catkin workspace. Take a look at http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_rosbuild_with_catkin .
