Q:

Moveit Commander Plan Fail

I'm using rospy and moveit_commander to control a robot. It works wonderfully, except I cannot find a way in the API to handle a path planning failure. The MoveGroupCommander.plan() method does not seem to expose any value that indicates failure in python. Is there something I'm missing?
Thanks

A:

If the plan fails, the RobotTrajectory is empty, so you can check it as described here:
plan = move_group.plan()
if plan.joint_trajectory.points:  # True if trajectory contains points
  move_success = move_group.execute(plan)
else:
  rospy.logerr("Trajectory is empty. Planning was unsuccessful.")
