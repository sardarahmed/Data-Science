Q:

Rosdep errors on osx; cant find dependencies

I just downloaded a vanilla ROS install for osx (desktop-full, electric), and my ultimate goal is to build the openni-kinect libraries.  Problems there aside, I seem to be encountering numerous errors within the rosdep dependency resolver.
Here is a simple test case:
$ rosdep install geometry

And the result:
Failed to find rosdep eigen for package tf_conversions on OS:osx version:lion
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install eigen

(Note: I am not able to build geometry either due to errors within the python-orocos-kdl package)
Errors similar to this with packages that need to be installed with macports are very prominent when I try to rosdep anything
Given that people have gotten this working on osx before, I can only conclude that I have done something wrong.

Are you using homebrew or macports for your dependencies?

FYI ... I still haven't gotten the kinect libraries (openni) to work right. However, I have been very successful with the open source libfreenect.

I am making some headway actually;  I have built (and used) openni before for an independent project.  It really doesn't want to play nicely with ROS though.

A:

Try following the homebrew install instructions, you shouldn't have an issue.

I want to, but I cant really switch from macports right now; I have too much built using it.
