Q:

ROS + Raspberry Pi + Motor Shield

Hi there
I am currently learning ROS and have a BrickPi motor shield which I would like to control in ROS
Are there any good tutorials for controlling a Raspberry Pi Python based motor shield?
I am guessing I need to write a subscriber in Python?  Most of the Arduino examples I see use serial.

Hi,
some years agi I tried the BrickPI+RPI for LEGO equipment (motors and sensors).
Check this for a start:

Good luck

Thank you, that looks epic.  Did you do a model for it to? so you can use it in RVIZ?

No, I've never did it.
A small picture only :-)

Thank you, I want to be able to use path finding with something I am building https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojPM1XSDD9M I guess, I need to use your script, then model the robot then use rviz to control it

Do you have any tele-op control for your script?
Comment by ChriMo on 2017-01-01:

(rosbridge must be started at you robot before)
Nice tool for remote teleop and first person camera view :-)

Whats Rosbridge for?  I go and google it :) So when I mean teleop, I mean a way to control the robot via the keyboard etc
