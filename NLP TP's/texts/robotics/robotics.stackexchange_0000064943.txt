Q:

Move Robot Base

I want to move robot_base to some position. I am reading this page http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup and wondering what the difference between 2.4 and 2.5 is. I mean one way I can do is to publish velocity command to base_controller/command but while I am reading this page, it seems like another way I can do is to publish to "odom". I am not sure what is the right way to do.

A:

The odometry source (2.4) is the result (displacement) of the command (cmd_vel) that is executed by the base controller (2.5).  So you tell your robot to go 1 m/s and the odometry source reports that has travelled 1 m after 1s, 2m after 2s, etc.  Is that clear?

so if I want to move the robot 1m, which way is better between using (cmd_vel) or publishing to odom?

odometry is the estimate of the pose of the robot so publishing to odom will not move the robot.  Publishing a cmd_vel and checking the odometry estimate can ensure you stop when you get to 1m.

yea, that makes sense. However, over here, under "Creating our own odometry," they seems to have a way to move the robot by publishing to odom.pose.pose
