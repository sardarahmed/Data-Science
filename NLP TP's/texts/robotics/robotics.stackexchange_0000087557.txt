Q:

ROS2: DDS RMW static discovery configuration

Hello,
I was wondering if ROS2 has an easy option to setup static discovery for RTI Connext Pro for example.
https://github.com/ros2/rmw_connext
It seems that the discovery is dynamic. Is there a possibility to give a XML file or give a list of initial peers to connect to ?

did you manage to set up static discovery? if you did can you please share your configuration files?
thanks

A:

There's no ROS 2 way of doing static discovery or indicating to the underlying middleware that you want to do it. You might be able to configure the underlying middleware to do it with a configuration file or something, but that will be vendor specific.
