Q:

Error while interfacing my webcam to ROS

I installed ros-indigo-usb-cam package and executed the code rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node ~video_device "/dev/video0" which resulted in following error
[ERROR] [1435589390.503107344]: outbuf size mismatch.  pic_size: 604160 bufsize: 614400
How to fix this error for my logitech USB webcam, also educate me how to view the vision specifications of the camera in ROS.

A:

Hello, I meet the same problem. My camera is logitech C525. And I finally resolved it.
Go to the catkin workspace,
$ gedit src/usb_cam/src/usb_cam.cpp

find the sentence and comment it like this,
if (pic_size != avframe_camera_size_)
{
   //  ROS_ERROR("wocaonima, outbuf size mismatch.  pic_size: %d bufsize: %d", pic_size, avframe_camera_size_);
   //  return; 
}

Then,
$ catkin_make

So that, resolve the problem.
