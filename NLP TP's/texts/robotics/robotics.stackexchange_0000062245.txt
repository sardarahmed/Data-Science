Q:

My screen is messed up after uninstalling ros. What is the problem? Please refer to the details for the full question

Hi. I'm new to Linux. I have installed Kubuntu on an acer Aspire 5040 for a project at school. I had also installed ROS on it and had been using the laptop to go through ROS tutorials. I had originally installed ROS fuerte on it but at some point I installed ROS groovy alongside fuerte. Due to some problems I decided to uninstall ROS all together. This is the command I used:
sudo apt-get remove ros-*
After it was completely uninstalled I turned off my laptop. The next day when I powered it back on, it would bring up the login window, but after loggin in I would see a black and white striped screen. Did I uninstall some drivers while I was trying to uninstall ROS? How can I make it work again? I would really appreciate your help.

A:

It's hard to say exactly what else was uninstalled when you removed ROS. You may want to review your dpkg log ( /var/log/dpkg.log ), and check the login type.
