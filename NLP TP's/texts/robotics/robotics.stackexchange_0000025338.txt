Q:

Insert multiple copies of the same model file?

Following the tutorial I spawn a model using option 3.
Is there a way to spawn multiple models that use the same model file using this method?
using GetModel->SetName before spawning a new model doesn't seem to work... the names never update in the gazebo gui and the previous model just disappears.

This feature doesn't exist, but I've created a  ticket for it.
