Q:

No response from "turtlebot" pc

Hi, i have been following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Network%20Configuration
But after editing my .bashrc according to the tutorial on both pcs like this:
Desktop PC:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.150:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.107
Laptop PC:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.150
I am not able to get any sort of communication between the two PCs. For instance, when i run roscore from the laptop (192.168.1.150) and rostopic list from my desktop (192.168.1.107), my desktop PC has no response at all. The same the other way around (even if i change the .bashrc ofc). I am using vmware on both PCs with a bridged connection that "replicates host pc connection", dont know if that has anything to do with it.
I can ping the PCs with each other.

Sorry I meant to say ROS_IP not ROS_HOSTNAME -
Set  ROS_IP=192.168.1.150 on the Desktop PC and on Laptop

With:
Desktop PC:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.150:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.150
Laptop PC:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.150
Rostopic list from the laptop gives "unable to communicate with master" and desktop gives no response.

Desktop gives no response with those .bashrc settings no matter whether i run rostopic list or roscore. And thank you for responding!
