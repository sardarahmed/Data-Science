Q:

How to - simple process module in CRAM

I am learning about CRAM designators and process modules. At this moment I am trying to create a stupid process module to check if I understand how the system works.
I am following this tutorial but I have not succeeded.
When I execute the following code:
CPL> (def-process-module navigation (input-designator)
          (let ((goal-pose (reference input-designator)))
            (or (execute-navigation-action goal-pose)
                (fail 'navigation-failed))))

An error is raised in SLIME:
The variable NAVIGATION is unbound.
    [Condition of type UNBOUND-VARIABLE]

I don't understand why this is happening. "Navigation" is the name of the process module I am trying to define, am I right? Therefore, I can understand an error raised because "execute-navigation-action" is not defined but not in "navigation". What I am missing?
Thanks in advance.

A:

You are in the wrong package. First load the package cram_process_modules:
(ros-load:load-system "cram_process_modules" :process-modules)

Then switch to the right package:
(in-package :cpm)
