Q:

rospy sensor_msgs.msg.BatteryState is not found

For some reason I'm not able to import the BatteryState message with rospy. This is the only message I've encountered that seems to be missing. http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/BatteryState.html
I'm using ros-indigo. Anyone else have this problem?

A:

The BatteryState message was added to Indigo in the most recent release of sensor_msgs, and it has not yet reached the public apt repository.
If you really need the battery message, you can use sensor_msgs from source, or you can keep an eye on the ros-users mailing list for the announcement of the next sync, which will be made when the updated version of the package reaches the public apt repo.

How might I install sensor_msgs for source for rospy?

Have a look at the answer here: http://answers.ros.org/question/208963/installing-package-from-source-in-indigo/ , but replace the git URL for descartes with the git URL provided on the sensor_msgs wiki page.

Thanks. I actually ended up installing BatteryState as a custom message in my package, copy/pasted from github.
