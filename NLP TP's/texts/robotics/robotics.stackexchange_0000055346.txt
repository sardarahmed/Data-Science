Q:

qt_gui_cpp fails to build on Debian Jessie

I've saw the same problem, posted a month ago, on debian sid, but I will post another question, because i can't copy all the failure log. I'm sorry if I'm wrong...
I'm using the latest version of catkin, qt_gui_cpp, python_qt_binding and pluginlib

shiboken 1.2.1-2
phyton-sip 4.15.3-1
boost 1.54.0
libqt4-dev  4:4.8.5+git121-g2a9ea11+dfsg1-2

I've forgot to say that this was an issue already in the beginning of september with groovy, I've solved updating shiboken package. But now I've the same package as Ubuntu...

For posterity: the solution is to remove libshiboken. This forces the installer to use an alternative library. The command to be used is "sudo apt-get remove libshiboken*". Hopefully there's nothing else on your system that depends on it.  This also fixes the same failure in Ubuntu 13.10.
