Q:

Cmake Error from openni2_camera

Hi all.
Anybody knows how can I correct these?
   CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:266 (message):
  A required package was not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:320 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
  openni2_camera/CMakeLists.txt:9 (pkg_check_modules)

CMake Error at openni2_camera/CMakeLists.txt:26 (message):
  message called with incorrect number of arguments

Can't get past this one no matter what.
Thanks for any help.

A:

If your Distribution does not have a OpenNi2-package, you need to build OpenNi2 from source and add a pkgconfig-file, e.g. /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/openni2.pc:
prefix=/usr/local/OpenNI2
includedir=${prefix}/Include
libdir=${prefix}/Bin/Arm-Release

Name: openni2
Description: OpenNI2
Version: 2.2.0.33
Cflags: -I${includedir}
Libs: -L${libdir} -lOpenNI2

Thanks! It works! I installed:
sudo apt-get install libopenni2-dev libopenni2-0 

And corrected the cmakelists.txt line 26 to:
message ("${PC_OPENNI2_LIBRARY_DIRS}")

Alternatively, you can run
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro <your distro>

to automatically install required dependencies
