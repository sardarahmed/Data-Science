Q:

[ros2cli] Cannot get the lifecycle state of lifecycle demo nodes?

I tried to get the lifecycle of the lifecycle demo node lifecycle_listener but got Node not found.
In terminal A:
$ ros2 daemon start
The daemon has been started
$ ros2 run lifecycle lifecycle_listener

In terminal B:
$ ros2 lifecycle get lifecycle_listener
Node not found

Even if I try to get the lifecycle from the node launched with the launch file with $ ros2 launch lifecycle lifecycle_demo.launch.py I get Node not found.

A:

Please run ros2 node list in the terminal B to see the names of running nodes. You will see that the node name is actually lc_listener. You could also use tab completion in a shell like bash to provide the available name: ros2 lifecycle get <tab>.
Anyway the result is still  Node not found. If you call ros2 service list you will see that the listener node only has parameter related services (not sure why that is the case). Please try to run the lifecycle_talker instead. That one shows the lifecycle related service and will also report the lifecycle state correctly.
PS: You don't have to start the daemon manually. That happens automatically when needed.
