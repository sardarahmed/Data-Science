A:

If you've just catkin_maked your workspace with your second package:

make sure to source /path/to/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash again (you'll have to do this after every package addition / removal)
run rospack profile to force an update of the package cache that roscd uses

Hello, Thanks this answer was helpful, I just have a small doubt, is it possible to directly add a sourcing line to my bashrc file ?

yes, but as you can read in my answer:

you'll have to [source] after every package addition / removal

so unless you source your .bashrc again after adding or removing packages, it still won't work.
And at that point you're sourceing either the devel/setup.bash or your .bashrc, which is the exact same amount of commands.
