Q:

RGBDSLAM on ROS Hydro: Missing resources

Hello everyone!
So, I have been trying to install RGBDSLAM on Hydro for quite some time now, but just can't get it to work. I was finally able to install Hydro from source successfully in /opt/ros/hydro and then I setup a catkin workspace in ~/ros/.
However, when I try to install the RGBDSLAM package I downloaded into~/ros/src, I get the following error:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies: 
rgbdslam: Missing resource roslang 
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/share/ros 
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/hydro/share 
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks 
ROS path [3]=/home/pb1/ros/src

I can roscd into the RGBDSLAM directory just fine, but whenever I try to install it comes up with these errors. I suspect this all has to do with how my catkin overlay / ROS directory is configured, but I could be wrong.
If anyone can help me through this, I'll really appreciate it.
Thanks!
P.S. I am working with Ubuntu ARM on a Pandaboard, if that is any help.

A:

I guess the rgbdslam_freiburg package is not build with "catkin" but "rosbuild", try to pull the package to a new workplace(without catkin) and add the workplace path to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  remember to follow the wiki  http://wiki.ros.org/rgbdslam
