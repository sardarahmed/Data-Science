Q:

Can I change the axis of rotation of the joints from urdf file?

I have a custom robot that is exported from fusion 360. In fusion I have no problems about the rotation of the joints. However when I export it to ros2 and use setup_assistant of the moveit2. The axis of rotation are different than 3D drawing. I would like to change them from the urdf file. Is there a way to this?

A:

Yes, you can modify it from its URDF file. Look for the joint tag:
<joint name="your_joint_name" ...>
...
        <axis xyz="0 0 1"/>
        <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
...
</joint>

Modify the value of axis tag and origin tag as you wish. Refer to the URDF joint documentation for their meanings.
