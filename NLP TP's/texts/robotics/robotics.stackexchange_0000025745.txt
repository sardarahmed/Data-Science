Q:

After updating to Gazebo 1.3 under ROS Groovy I get a .launch file error

Hi,
Another question that might be related to this one.
I am using ROS Groovy and I updated Gazebo to 1.3 (binary version), under Ubuntu 12.04. When launching an empty world with the following .launch file:
<launch>

  <arg name="use_sim_time" default="true"/>
  <arg name="gui" default="true"/>

  <!-- set use_sim_time flag -->
  <group if="$(arg use_sim_time)">
    <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true" />
  </group>

  <!-- start empty world -->
  <node name="empty_world_server" pkg="gazebo" type="gazebo" args="$(find hit_hand)/worlds/empty.world" respawn="false" output="screen"/>

  <!-- start gui -->
  <group if="$(arg gui)">
    <node name="gazebo_gui" pkg="gazebo" type="gui" respawn="false" output="screen"/>
  </group>

</launch>

I get the following error:
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Did the launch file semantics change, or it is related to the other error?
Thanks, Andrei

A:

I figured it out, in the launch file the node name is not allowed anymore to have the "_" character in the name.
<!-- start empty world -->
  <node name="empty_world_server" .. />

becomes:
<!-- start empty world -->
  <node name="emptyworldserver" .. />

I'm almost positive that's not true.

this must have been a bug at the moment: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'ros::InvalidNameException' what():  Character [-] at element [20] is not valid in Graph Resource Name [empty_world_server13-01-30].  Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, / and _. event though the _ is listed.
Comment by Neil Traft on 2014-07-24:
Yeah that's referring to a graphics resource name, not a node name. But I think I've recently discovered the source of that error: it's a bug in Gazebo 1.5 on 32-bit machines.
