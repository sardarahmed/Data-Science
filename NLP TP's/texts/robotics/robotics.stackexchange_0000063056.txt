Q:

Where to find a rosbag

Hello everyone,
I know I've seen that question somewhere but I can't seem to find it again. I would like to know if there is somewhere I can download rosbags. Like a database of rosbag available for free. It could be a very handy thing. Like for now I'm stuck without a camera and I'm searching for a rosbag of an Xtion looking at an object. I'm pretty someone else already have done this.
If there isn't, does someone have rosbag of this type I could possibly use ?
Thanks a lot !

A:

Many computer vision research labs working on ROS/robotics will have what you need.
First few links from a quick Google search:
