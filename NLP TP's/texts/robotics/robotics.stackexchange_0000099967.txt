Q:

gzserver: error while loading shared libraries: libdart-collision-bullet.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I don't even know how did this happen. One day, I just open the laptop and start to work. Suddenly, it's not working anymore.
I can't even run turtlebot3. I reinstalled foxy and gazebo11. No luck. It just...out of blue not working again.
killall gzserver/killall gzclient/ pkill doesn't help at all. ANy idea? I really want to use gazebo again
error
gzserver: error while loading shared libraries: libdart-collision-bullet.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

even i reinstall gazebo11, this happens still.
bwuk@robots:~$ cd /usr/local/bin/gazebo
bash: cd: /usr/local/bin/gazebo: No such file or directory
bwuk@robots:~$

I still have .model though
bwuk@robots:~$ cd .gazebo/models/
bwuk@robots:~/.gazebo/models$

Everytime I load gazebo from launch, it simply frozen, crashed or says directory doesn't exist.
How did this happen?
I even echo path, but it just don't show any result
bwuk@robots:~$ echo $GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH

bwuk@robots:~$ echo $GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH

bwuk@robots:~$

I'm using foxy, gazebo11 and ubuntu 20.04

A:

Solution:

sudo apt remove --purge libdart*

Remove dartsim/ppa in Software &  Updates -> Other Software

sudo apt update

sudo apt install libdart-dev

sudo apt install libdart-all-dev (only if above installs)

But if this failed due to unable to fetch some archives, run this
sudo apt update --fix-missing && sudo apt install libdart-all-dev

Install gazebo curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh

gazebo (to check if it works now)

If you still getting error after attempt to load gazebo from launch in ros2, then follow this;
. /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh inside your workspace.

Please do not post link-only answers, especially not when those links lead to 3rd party sites (ie: not on ros.org or ROS related Github pages): the links go stale pretty quickly.
Please summarise how you solved your problem here in your answer.
