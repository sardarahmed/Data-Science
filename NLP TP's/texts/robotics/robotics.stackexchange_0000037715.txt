Q:

learning_ps3joy

I am setting up a ps3 joystick, according to the ps3joy tutorial - WritingTeleopNode.
I have followed the instructions and built the sample code for the teleop_turtle_joy.cpp.
I also created the sample launch file.  However, I am not sure how to run this.  When I try:
roslaunch learning_ps3joy turtleps3joy.launch
I get the error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ps3joy/ps3_joy_node]: Cannot locate node of type [ps3_joy_node] in package [ps3joy]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [turtle_teleop/turtle_teleop_joy]: Cannot locate installation of package turtle_teleop: [rospack] couldn't find package [turtle_teleop]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/electric/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/turtlebot/tutorials/workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks]

This is using ROS Electric on Ubuntu 10.04 lucid.
Any suggestions would be helpful.  I just want to control the bot with the Ps3 joystick.
Thanks.

A:

Make sure you build your new package using rosmake, which will build the dependencies, including ps3joy, which will fix the first error
Make sure you have the turtle_teleop package installed and on your ROS Path, which will likely fix the second error.
