Q:

Image Transport Compressed issue for Depth Image - ROS Fuerte

Hi,
I am using Depth Image for one of my applications, where I need to use compressed image transport for some server/client app.
If I use param -> "_image_transport:=raw", everything works fine, but if I use "compressed" instead of "raw", then the depth values that I get are not similar.
I am using "/camera/depth/image_raw" topic and converting the image into "16UC1" format using cv_bridge. Then I access the depth values using a Mat and type "ushort".
Is there some issue with the format of image that I need to change for accessing the depth values for compressed image transport?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Solution: The default compression algorithm is "jpeg" which should be changed to "png" in case of depth image.
This can be done by changing the "format" parameter for that topic(/image_transport_type).
