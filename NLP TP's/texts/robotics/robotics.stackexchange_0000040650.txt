Q:

Problem running openni_launch on ros fuerte with Xtion pro live

Hi ros user!
I try to use a Asus Xtion pro live with ROs Fuerte and openni_launch.
I have made a lot of test but I have not been able to make it work.
It is always the same thing I have got this Error message :
[ERROR] [1337435292.200305197]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/compressed/set_parameters]

[ERROR] [1337435292.210206934]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/camera/depth_registered/image_rect_raw/theora/set_parameters]

Exept this error every thing else seems alright. It detect the camera :
[ INFO] [1337435291.552393164]: Number devices connected: 1
[ INFO] [1337435291.552631121]: 1. device on bus 001:03 is a PrimeSense Device (600) from PrimeSense (1d27) with serial id ''
[ INFO] [1337435291.554548510]: Searching for device with index = 1
[ INFO] [1337435291.687868149]: Opened 'PrimeSense Device' on bus 1:3 with serial number ''

But there is no message publish on the topic /camera/depth/points. I have tried different topics but none of then publish any message. I use RVIZ to see the topics.
I was previously running ros on Ubuntu 10.04 running on  VMWare Player. When I encourtered this error I decided to try on different Ubuntu version but
I have got the same error on each of the version I have tried.
I have tried Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04.
On ubuntu 12.04 I have got much more error so I concentred myself on ubuntu 11.10 which I suppose is the better version of Ubuntu to work with Asus Xtion.
I have even try to install ros fuerte from source but it doesn't resolve anything. Still the same error!
Now I don't know what to do.
Have I missed something?
I guess that with ros fuerte and openni_launch I have nothing else to install? right?
Openni Driver and everything else is package with openni_launch? right?
Any help apreciate.
Things in advance.
Regards.
Christophe.
EDIT TO MY INITIAL POST:
Yes all my previous try where done on VMWare. I have now installed Ubuntu 12.04 directly on my PC and now everything works fine! I am able to see point cloud in RVIZ! Thanks for taking time to answer me!

Were all your ubuntu test instances on a VM?

A:

Those messages are normal when running the openni launch file.
There are at least two possibilities here:

You haven't chosen an appropriate frame in rviz
Your driver isn't publishing any messages

You can troubleshoot the point cloud topic without rviz by doing
rostopic hz /camera/depth/points
If you don't see any output within 30 seconds or so, there's a problem with your driver. If you see output indicating that the driver is publishing around 30Hz, the problem is with your rviz settings.
