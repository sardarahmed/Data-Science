A:

setup.sh will be in different places depending on how you installed ROS. If you're on Ubuntu and used apt-based install, it will be in /opt/ros/[version]/. If you did a source-based install using rosinstall, it will be in whatever directory you passed in as the first argument to rosinstall (~/ros is what's frequently used in the examples).
