Q:

tracked_vehicle_simple.sdf vehicle not moving?

I was trying to run the simulation with tracked_vehicle_simple.sdf. Whenever I press the keyboard button, it seems that the speeds and the vehicle pose are updated (from checking the topic /model/simple_tracked/odometry). However, the vehicle itself is not moving. I wonder if I made any mistake?
