Q:

low rate of stereo prosilica cameras for face_detector

I'm using a pair of prosilica cameras on care-o-bot, receiving images (left, right, disparity) at rate of about 2 hz, few synchronized triples, which leads to use _approximate_sync:=True _queue_size:=10 in stereo_proc and stereo_view
now face_detector is not working for this pair, while it works fine with a recorded bag video (test), has anyone any idea? suggession, please?

What is the network connection between the nodes and what else is runnong over that connection?

A:

sorry should correct part of my last comment as below:
I downgraded bag playing rate to 2 hz to simulate real camera, face_detector is working fine, so images (camera) synchronization should be a matter not the low rate.

rostopic hz /stereo/left/image_rect is about 2.2    rostopic hz /stereo/right/image_rect is about 2.4      rostopic hz /stereo/disparity is about 1.6
