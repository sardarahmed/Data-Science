Hello,
I am running docker container with ros2 galactic and ros1 noetic, and whenever I try to run the launch file the error appears saying

The error have not appeared before and I don't know why this error appears suddenly.
I always source the ROS1 noetic then ROS2 galactic while using ros1_bridge to communicate with other container whose version is ROS1 melodic.
Thank you!

@Mike Scheutzow Thank you for let me know! I will keep that in mind!

A:
