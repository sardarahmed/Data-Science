Q:

libbullet not installed

I'm attempting to do a manual install of a lower version of gazebo for a specific work environment.
Since I was working on a blank Ubuntu OS that never had gazebo installed. I first used sudo apt-get install gazebo,then sudo apt-get remove gazebo to keep the dependencies, but not the up-to-date version.
However, when I try to install the package I want, it goes like this:
sudo dpkg -i gazebo_1.7.3-1~precise_amd64.deb
Selecting previously unselected package gazebo.
(Reading database ... 188459 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking gazebo (from gazebo_1.7.3-1~precise_amd64.deb) ...
dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of gazebo:
gazebo depends on libbullet; however:
Package libbullet is not installed.
dpkg: error processing gazebo (--install):
dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
Processing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...
Processing triggers for bamfdaemon ...
Rebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf.index...
Processing triggers for gnome-menus ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
gazebo
Apparently, there is still one dependency that wasn't added. How do I go about installing libbullet?

Just to clarify. sudo apt-get install libbullet-dev did not work.

A:

Looks like a problem with the libbullet version needed by gazebo.
While ubuntu ships 2.80, gazebo uses 2.81, so you will need to install debs from the OSRF repository. Two ways:

Download libbullet-dev and libbullet-2.81 manually from OSRF package repository.
Easier: add the OSRF repository to your system and install libbullet-dev from there.

ran sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu precise main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'    then wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu/pool/main/b/bullet/libbullet-dev_2.81-2ppa1~precise_amd64.deb  and wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu/pool/main/b/bullet/libbullet_2.81-2ppa1~precise_amd64.deb      then sudo dpkg -i for both     that seemed to do the trick.

Right, but you have mixed the methods. Only with download and dpkg -i should be enough, you don't need to setup the repository if you are not going to use apt-get install to get the packages.
