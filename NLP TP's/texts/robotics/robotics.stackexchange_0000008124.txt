Q:

Two exclusive inputs control

I have a system with two inputs (throttle and brake) and one output (speed). How does one design a controller in such a way that the two outputs of the controller (throttle and brake) are never both greater than zero (so that it doesn't accelerate and brake simultaneously)?
Thanks

A:

The system is nonlinear for acceleration. If the desired acceleration value is bigger than 0, use the throttle, if smaller than 0, use the break.
Other than that, you should be fine using a cascaded control loop with an inner acceleration loop and an outer speed control loop. Despite the fact that it has a discontinuity in the acceleration control loop, you should be able to treat it as a linear one if both break and throttle can be set to arbitrary small values, creating a smooth transition between the use of throttle and break at 0 acceleration.
