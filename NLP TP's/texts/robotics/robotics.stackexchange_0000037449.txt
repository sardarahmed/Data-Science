Q:

port problems for not being root

Hello,
I'm working with a xsense-mti with this node. I can run it perfectly as a root if i type: su, the pasword and then I go to the bin folder in the package and run ./mti_node
The thing is that when I try to run rosrun lse_xsens_mti mti_node I cannot connect to the port. How can I change it? If I can not run it as a normal user I can not launch it from a file with the rest of nodes I'm inerested!
Thanks.

A:

I think you are missing permissions on the device.
The easiest might be to add yourself to the dialout group as in most cases that's where it is. Otherwise you need to setup udev rules.
What does ls -l /dev/ttyUSB* and id -a give you?
I use this udev rule for xsens:

# xsens FTDIs with product id d38b
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="d38b", SYMLINK+="sensors/ftdi_%s{serial}", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout"

if i ls - l /dev/ttyUSB* and the result is  No such file or directory.
and id-a gives :
uid=1000(adelleodel) gid=1000(adelleodel) groups=1000(adelleodel),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lpadmin),124(sambashare)what to do?
