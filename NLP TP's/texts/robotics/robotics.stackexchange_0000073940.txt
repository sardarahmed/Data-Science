Q:

How to add a package to the package list in ROS.org wiki

Hi.
I would like to add my package on GitHub to the package list in ROS.org wiki.

Is there a manual about it?
Thank you

What they call release is the way to go. In ROS it's conveniently done by using a tool called bloom. Here is a set of tutorials for making a release using bloom. In particular, see FirstTimeRelease in the first place.
