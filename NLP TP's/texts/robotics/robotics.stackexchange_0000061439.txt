A:

If your IDE can properly index the ros java and android projects, you should be able to follow the imports to their source (or perhaps only the interface, if you've installed a binary dist).
If you've installed from source, you should find the sources for those classes in your catkin workspace.
If all else fails: you can find the sources in the appropriate branches of the android_core project in the rosjava GitHub organisation. See android_core/hydro for the Hydro branch.
PS: there is quite some documentation on (part of) the ROS Android libraries. See fi: android_core 0.1.0 documentation.
