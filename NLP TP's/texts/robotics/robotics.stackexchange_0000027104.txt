Q:

Publishing JointStates in ROS with Gazebo

I am loading a SDF into Gazebo using the gazebo_ros/spawn_model. I am loading a joint_state_controller through the controller_manager and its even publishing a joint_state message. However, there are no joints listed in the joint_state message despite it containing multiple not-fixed joints.
Any ideas how to make the joint_state message include the proper joints?
Edit:
SDF Snippet:
<plugin name="gazebo_ros_control" filename="libgazebo_ros_control.so">
  <robotNamespace>valve</robotNamespace>
</plugin>

this is using gazebo_ros_control?

Yes, see edit.

Hi,
I am not absolute sure about this but I think this plugin requires an URDF to work correctly. the gazebo_ros_control plugin will block until it gets the urdf from the server( method getURDF from  gazebo_ros_control_plugin.cpp )
I guess this causes your problems...

This looks promising, because I have a URDF, but it wasn't under the default robot_description parameter.
