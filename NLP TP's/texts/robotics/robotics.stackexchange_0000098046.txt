Q:

Use virtual machine display in docker

I'm trying to start GUI apps like rviz using ros2-eloquent docker image.
My setup consists in a simple VirtualBox Ubuntu 18.04 setup.
Is there any need to rebuild from scratch using a Dockerfile ? or just a specific parameter to docker run ?

A:

It's not clear but I'm assuming you're running docker inside of your VirtualBox VM.
With that in mind there's several ways to approach this documented here: http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI
The simplest way is to use rocker.
Whichever approach you choose, you may have performance issues stemming from the multiple layers of virtualization and trying to get 3D accelerated graphics passed through fully. It's certainly not been tested in that configuration.
