Q:

roslaunch not working

Hello!
When trying to run
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

I am getting the following error:
[keyboard_teleop.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot_teleop] nor is [turtlebot_teleop] a launch file name 
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

the file exists though and the whole installation before worked fine! I don't know where to look. Any ideas?

A:

Have you remembered to source /path/to/the/relevant/setup.bash file in your terminal? You have to do that for every new terminal again, unless you've configured your .bashrc to do it for you.

I configured my file to do it for me. It is really strange. I changed into my directory where the teleop.launch is located and ran
roslaunch keyboard_teleop.launch
im getting following output:

From your other questions I think you built the turtlebot pkgs from source, right? Is the workspace where you did that also sourced? Your (possibly truncated) error shows only the default paths, not a source workspace. If the 'turtlebot workspace' is not on the path, roslaunch can't find the pkgs.

Thanks! roslaunch seems to work now for bringup and communications. But I get the same error now when trying roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch ...

Please add more detailed information (edit your question) on how you installed ROS (using the debs, completely from source, or just the turtlebot bits from source), how you catkin workspaces are layed out, how many you have and how you use them. Without that we can only guess at what is going on.
