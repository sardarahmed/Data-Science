Q:

Will rosjava be supported on Lunar and future releases?

I found some articles on REST services using rosjava and would like to know the feasibility of this using the latest ROS releases and latest Ubuntu releases.
Per http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava, Lunar does not support rosjava. Will this be the same for future releases? If rosjava is no longer supported, are there examples for roscpp to support REST services?

A:

@coolbeans if you want to try those REST services in Lunar / Ubuntu 17, I'd try using rosjava from source: http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/kinetic/Source%20Installation. As far as I understand, it should work -perhaps you will need to rebuild some messages if the version changes from Kinetic to Lunar, or similar compatibility issues-.
Supporting Lunar is not in the roadmap, but the next release associated with a LTS version might be supported in the future.
