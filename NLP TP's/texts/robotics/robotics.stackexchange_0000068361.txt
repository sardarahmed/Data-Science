Q:

hokuyo UTM-30LX-EW laser scanner: problems to detect

Hi guys I'm having problems to detect hokuyo UTM-30LX-EW Laser Scanner. I followed the guide installation on wikiros and first I installed the hokuyo_node (actually I tried also with other package, urg_node). The problem is in the second step: I insert the Ethernet cable and when I search the laser into dev/  I don't find it. I found dev/tty0, dev/ttyS0 etc.. but not dev/ttyACM0 as is described in the guide. How I can detect the laser?

A:

With the Hokuyo UTM-30LX-EW connected through ethernet, you can use the urg_node, setting the ip_address parameter value. Default factory Hokuyos come with IP 192.168.0.10.
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:=192.168.0.10

-- Edit 1:
PC and laser must be on the same net 192.168.0.XX. Then, you should be able to ping the laser first,
ping 192.168.0.10

-- Edit 2:
If it does not work on a PC with IP 192.168.0.XX, maybe your Hokuyo laser has a different IP address.
To be sure, you can reset the laser IP address to the default one (192.168.0.10), following the instructions from the Laser specification (last page, section 9 - Ethernet settings - IP Initialization ), provided at the Hokuyo webpage.
If you manage to make it work with the default IP address but then you need to work in a different sub net, in the Hokuyo webpage there is a tool (for Windows) to change the laser IP address.

[ERROR] [1435675488.414973920]: Error connecting to Hokuyo: Could not open network Hokuyo: 192.168.0.10:10940 could not open ethernet port.
this is what the command returns

Reading this question, they basically say your computer and the laser must be on the same net (192.168.0.XX).

Unfortunately I cannot fix that problem, I have already read all the post that I found.
This afternoon I try with this other guide: [http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/wiki/index.php/3._Using_a_hokuyo_LIDAR_with_ROS]
In this guide I don't change the IP!
thanks fherrero for the help!

That guide looks a bit old (ubuntu 10 and ROS Fuerte). I recommend you to reset the laser IP address (see Edit 2 of my answer) and continue trying with urg_node

Thanks fherrero for the advices,
Finally it works!! I had to initialize it manually!

My Hokuyo UST-10LX does not reset when connecting COM- to IP-RESTART for +2 second. Actually I cut those two wires (light blue and gray) and made a solid contact for several time, each more than 2 second. LED remains solid blue and does not blink. I don't have the existing IP address to work with the LiDAR. Any Idea ?
