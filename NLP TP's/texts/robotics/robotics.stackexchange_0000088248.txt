Q:

How is the partition decided in ROS2?

In ROS2 Ardent, the default partition used is rt/. I recently got a ROS2 publisher code snippet where nothing was mentioned about the partition. So I assumed it to be rt/ but when I ran the RTI Admin Console, I got to know that the partition used was rt/ros.
Where do I alter it ?

A:

Until ROS Bouncy, the full topic names were constructed as follow:
<ROS_PREFIX>/<NAMESPACE>/<TOPIC_NAME> where:
ROS_PREFIX is one of the prefixes defined here
Some examples can be found here
The partition value is everything before the last forward slash. In you case I assume that the namespace is ros, resulting in a fully qualified topic name rt/ros/my_topic. This leads to the partition rt/ros and the topic name my_topic.
Note that as of ROS Bouncy the partitions are not used anymore so for the topic rt/ros/my_topic the partition will be an empty string and the DDS topic name will be rt/ros/my_topic
