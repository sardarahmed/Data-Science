Q:

Moveit gdb debugging

Hi,
I'm trying to run move_group code through gdb. I compiled moveit from sources with --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug.
Still, it seems like debug information haven't been lost.
What I did:
I ran my own node that uses move_group.plan(my_plan) and tried to step through plan(). But it doesn't step into the function like it hadn't written debugging data.
I use ros kinetic
Would use any help. Thanks

Are you sure you're using ROS2? Is there MoveIt available for ROS2 already? It's just to make sure. I am working with ROS1 and I'm not sure if there is a bit difference when it comes to debugging.

A:

I guess in your case move_group is actually a moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface.
This class is only a ROS-wrapper which sends a goal to a ROS action.
If you want to debug the planning process you have to run the move_group node in gdb and set a breakpoint on the function that receives the action goal.
