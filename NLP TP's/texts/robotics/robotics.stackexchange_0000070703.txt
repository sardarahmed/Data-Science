Q:

Ros indigo p2os_teleop not working

Hello,
I'm new with Ros. Just started working with Pioneer P3-DX using p2os.
i installed p2os-perdue on ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Ros Indigo

I launched : rosrun p2os_drive p2os_drive   ( to connect to the robot)
it seems to work, because the robot name appeared, I'am using serial port PC<->robot
there is an annoying bipping though, i don't really know if it's normal, but i'am able to get robot motor state  with
"rostopic echo /motor_state"

i launched: rosrun p2os_teleop  p2os_teleop
No errors detected but when pressing the keyboard while on the terminal (ex: left arrow and right arrow)
characters appears (like : [[A ) but nothing happening , robot not moving

I even tried with: rostopic pub /cmd_vel  geometry_msg/Twist '[0.1, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]'
still nothing, robot not moving at all :/

so please Help :(

A:

solve 1) and 3) by adding _pulse:=1 as argument to p2os_drive
