Q:

Nvidia Jetson Nanon GPIO c++ direct memory interfacing

Is there's any library to interface the Jetson Nano GPIO?
There's the official Python interface, and there is an unofficial c++ interface which is working through the filesystem, and I'm interested in the direct register access.
There is a post here by someone who claims he has achived it, but before I re-imlement the reference manual, It would be great if someone already did it.

A:

I created a library that does just that, mapping the tegra CPU registers in user space. My lib is here: https://github.com/Rubberazer/JETGPIO it can be called from C or C++
