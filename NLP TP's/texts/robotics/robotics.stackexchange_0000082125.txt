Q:

Failure in MoveIt! move_group on Ubuntu Mate 16.04 ROS Kinetic on Raspberry Pi 3

Hi everyone,
I am trying to implement and build my manipulator packages on the Raspberry Pi 3, once I have already successfully installed Ubuntu Mate 16.04, ROS Kinetic and MoveIt!, but there are some problems related with the move_group node when I launch my .launch file, although everything worked fine on my Ubuntu 16.04 desktop .
This is what happens when I launch it on the Raspberry Pi 3:
[ INFO] [1500982430.452887547]: Loading robot model 'manipulator'...
...
[move_group-4] process has died [pid 2757, exit code -11, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/moveit_ros_move_group/move_group --debug __name:=move_group __log:=/home/david/.ros/log/1f22c09e-712d-11e7-8611-7989bb2a9d91/move_group-4.log].
log file: /home/david/.ros/log/1f22c09e-712d-11e7-8611-7989bb2a9d91/move_group-4*.log

I suppose that the problem must be related with the FCL collision libraries of MoveIt! and how they work on Raspberry Pi 3, since if I remove all the visual and collision elements of my URDF file everything works well, but then obviously collisions could not be detected. Anyway, I couldn't figure out how to solve this problem yet, anyone can help me?
Thanks
UPDATE:
This is what I get running the launch file with debug=true
Reading symbols from /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/moveit_ros_move_group/move_group...(no debugging symbols found)...done.

no debugging symbols found

as you can see, gdb doesn't have any symbols, so it can't give you a proper backtrace.
you can try to see what the output is when you enter bt and then press the <enter> key, but I doubt it will be useful.

A:

< assumption>Is the fcl package for the raspberry pi still broken?< /assumption>
This segfault gets reported up over and over again for the last couple of months (at least) and you should be able to find github issues, mails to moveit-users and/or rosanswers issues on this (assuming it's the same issue)...
The last thing I heard about this were some speculations on broken compiler flags used to build the package.
Maybe you can get it to work by compiling FCL from source?

Seeing as this is an ARM platform, it could also be the suspect mesh loading that makes things crash on platforms != x86-64.
@davideuse: -11 is a SEGFAULT. It would really help if you could post a backtrace.
Comment by davideuse on 2017-08-03:
@gvdhoorn: I am using binary .stl files in the mesh, do you think that this could be the problem?
I have updated the issue with a backtrace running the launch file with debug=true as you suggested
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-08-03:
That is not a backtrace. You'll need to enter bt into gdb's prompt and execute that.
Comment by davideuse on 2017-08-03:
Yes but it doesn't work either, this is what I get then:
#0 0x76fd9dde in ?? () from /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3
#1 0x76fd9dde in ?? () from /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3
Backtrace stopped: previous frame identical to this frame (corrupt stack?)

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-08-03:
Then you'll have to probably build MoveIt from source if you want to get a proper backtrace. But it could be that stack smashing makes this impossible anyway, regardless of whether the symbols are present.

Bumping this, I'm experiencing the same issue. Installing FCL from source didn't fix anything so I'm currently trying to install moveit from source to test that. Will post back with any results.
Comment by rmck on 2017-10-26:
Installed from source and came across the same issue. I've bumped an existing issue on the moveit github page with some output from gdb. - https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/564
