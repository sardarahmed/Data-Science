Q:

Help Building Custom BAXTER grippers

I need help figuring out these two errors. They are both related, so solving one should solve the other.
I'm building custom grippers for Baxter in Ros-Indigo (ubuntu 1404.2). I've built a custom URDF file along with a custom launch file. This error is the last error I have to figure out.

A:

Update: I have reworked some of the logic in Baxter's simulated Position Kinematics node to prevent it from making the  assumption that I mention below. You can now have additional joints on your Baxter URDF without any naming restrictions. The fix can be viewed here: https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_simulator/pull/73
Original Answer: The baxter_sim_kinematics node makes a very bad assumption - all of the joints for the arm will be the only ones that begin with the strings <left/right>, rather than loading all 7 of them from a param or yaml file. Then whenever an additional joint is added that starts with <left/right>, it core dumps. Not a great design. It is a bit far down on my bug list to tackle, as it requires someone be adding a custom end effector to Baxter. As a workaround, start your joint with <l/r> or any other string that is not "left" or "right" instead. Please open a ticket for this on baxter_simulator if there isn't one already. Sorry for the inconvenience!

Thanks that worked! Just for clarification, I went into my URDF file and adjusted all the joint names that started with:
"right_..." or "left_..."
to
"r_..." and "l_..." respectively. Thanks for your help.
