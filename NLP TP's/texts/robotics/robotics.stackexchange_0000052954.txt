Q:

Eclipse and catkin problems (symbol could not be resolved)

Hi all,
unfortunately i ran into some problems when trying to debug my rospackage in Eclipse (Kepler).
I followed these instructions in terminal:

catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"   (in my catkin workspace)
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
eclipse

Then importing the project to eclipse works also fine.
But editing one file in the [Source directory]/myPackage/src/talker.cpp result in these errors, for example for this line of code:
ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000);

i recieve these errors:
-symbol advertised could not be resolved
-Invalid arguments ' Candidates are: ros::Publisher advertise(const ? &, unsigned int, bool) ros::Publisher advertise(ros::AdvertiseOptions &) ros::Publisher advertise(const ? &, unsigned int, const boost::function<void (const ros::SingleSubscriberPublisher &)> &, const boost::function<void (const ros::SingleSubscriberPublisher &)> &, const boost::shared_ptr<const void> &, bool) ' talker.cpp  /Project-Debug@build/[Source directory]/rosgui/src  line 83 Semantic Error

also eclipse can't find: #include 
this is what i tried so far:

running cmake ./src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  (in my catkin_workspace)
rebuilding the indexer in eclipse
tried it with eclipse Indigo

here the include paths in eclipse properties:
#ROS_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1
#ROS_PACKAGE_NAME="rosgui"
/usr/src/gtest
/home/thomas/catkin_ws/devel/include
/home/thomas/catkin_ws/src/rosgui/include
/opt/ros/groovy/include
/usr/include

Thank your very much for any advice!!

Same problem:  http://answers.ros.org/question/105446/eclipse-ide-problem/

A:

You should include those paths:
/usr/include/c++/4.6
/usr/include/c++/4.6/x86_64-linux-gnu
/usr/include/c++/4.6/backward
