Q:

How do I install OpenNI, OpenNI2 and Freenect in ROS Hydro?

I am new to ROS, and I have been trying to install the ros version of rtabmap. Everything has gone fine, but when trying to interface with a kinect sensor I am required to install the OpenNI, OpenNI2 and Freenect packages. I know that ros has a utility called rosinstall, but I am confused about exactly WHICH packages to install using rosinstall - can anyone give me a hand with this? A bit of a simple question, sorry.

A:

I think you should have a look at these links (freenect_camera, openni_camera, freenect_stack). You can apt-get install these packages directly if you have a debian Hydro already installed. alternatively you can also clone and build each package in your catkin workspace and source the devel/setup.bash to work with these packages.
For. eg:

mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src

cd  ~/catkin_ws/src

git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_camera.git

cd ..

catkin_make

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

and finally you can do

roscd openni_camera

to check if your ROS is able to see this package or not. Hope this helps.

Thanks, this was super helpful. I ended up doing the apt-get install, but I was hoping to just install it to my workspace. I tried everything you listed above, but instead of using the individual packages I cloned the freenect stack git (it didn't work). Also - what does roscd openni_camera do?

may be you have not installed the git in your pc you can try sudo apt-get install git first and then try the above steps. roscd is the ros implementation of the linux cd (a.k.a. change directory command) which is used to navigate to the ros packages in your pc.
