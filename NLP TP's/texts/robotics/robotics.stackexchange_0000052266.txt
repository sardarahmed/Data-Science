Have you execute sudo apt-get update ?

Please include the full error message with copy and paste, as well as the commands you are attempting.

yes I did the update, I will try to copy and paste the error tomorrow as its all installed on my work machine.

A:

Does groovy even support 13.04/raring?
According to joq's answer here, and the groovy page here, that's waiting for Hydro.
Given that you're running in a virtual machine anyways, I'd strongly recommend using Ubuntu 12.04 instead.

Thank you this is all very new to me, I was following a guide with links that kept taking me to version 13.04. I shall try again tomorrow with 12.04. So far I am not enjoying the whole Linux experience let hope it improves.

If you're switching to linux to learn this you'll need to be a little bit patient to learn both at once.
