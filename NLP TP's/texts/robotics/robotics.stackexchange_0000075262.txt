Q:

kinetic smach_viewer or alternatives

Hello,
I tried the tutorial with smach and saw that the smach_viewer isn't supported on ros kinetic.
Is smach still used in some projects or is there another solution for state machines in ROS kinetic ?
thanks for your help

A:

I found a way to make rqt_smach (which kind of is smach_viewer) work in kinetic - see my gist on Github for more information.
