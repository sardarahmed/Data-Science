Q:

ros2-crazyswarm2

We'd like to use crazyswarm2 packages. However we got below error about motion_capture stuff. How to figure out that problem, thanks.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmotion_capture_tracking_interfaces.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    motion_capture_tracking_interfacesConfig.cmake
    motion_capture_tracking_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

A:

Most likely that your motion_capture_tracking_interfaces package did not compile/is not present.
If the package is present in the same workspace, i.e., if your src directory looks like the following:
src
|-> crazyflie
|    | . . .
|-> crazyflie_examples
|    | . . .
|-> crazyflie_py
|    | . . . 
|-> motion_capture_tracking_interfaces

Then you can try compiling the motion_capture_tracking_interfaces package first by using colcon build --packages-select motion_capture_tracking_interfaces.
You should also examine if you made an error (maybe a typo) in the find_packages section of the CMakeLists.txt of the package is calling the correct package name. I have had multiple instances of this error where I mistakenly called find_package(<project>-mgs REQUIRED) which led me to this error.
P.S.: On the off-chance that you might need to actually write the Config.cmake yourself, this answer on StackOverflow is one of the best explanations I have come across.
