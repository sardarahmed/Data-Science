Q:

move_base global planner plans outside static map

Hi,
The default global planner plans outside the static map i.e. unexplored area. Is there any parameter I have missed out?
planner_params.yaml
base_local_planner: dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS
recovery_behaviors: []
planner_frequency: 0
planner_patience: 1000.0
controller_patience: 1000.0
recovery_behavior_enabled: false
clearing_rotation_allowed: false
controller_frequency: 20.0

global_constmap_params.yaml
global_costmap:
  global_frame: /map
  robot_base_frame: base_link
  update_frequency: 1.0
  static_map: true

Unfortunately during mapping, not all parts of the room was bounded by a wall i.e. black color cells in the occupancy map. The planner found a path that goes outside the static map from one end and then into the other side of the room.

A:

It depends on which global planner you're using, but in navfn, the parameter is allow_unknown

I am using navfn and I set it to allow_unknown as false. However, it still plans outside static map. I verified this parameter by printing it in initialize() and also viewing the potential that goes outside the static map.

Ok so when I use track_unknown: true and unknown_cost_value: 255 inside costmap_common.yaml, I can get what I want. If this is a necessary parameter, it must be added to the navigation tutorial

Great! Glad you figured it out.
