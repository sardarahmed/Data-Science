Q:

Can RVIZ send the camera image (with TF...) as a image topic?

Hello
I'm currently using the RVIZ camera display to visualize tf/Robotmodel/etc in my camera image. I'd like to show this combined view in a GUI. It would be very nice if I could get RVIZ to publish this topic on a normal image topic.
Has anyone done this before? I've so far not written my own plugin for RVIZ and hope that there is some easier way.
Cheers,
Nikolas

A:

I don't think RViz can do that (directly).
Another option -- admittedly a bit more involved -- might be to use the visualisation bits of RViz (so not the GUI itself) directly in your GUI. See Librviz Tutorial.
