Q:

arduino custom msg

Hello, can anybody point me in the right direction as to how to set up custom ROS messages for the arduino? I am using rosserial_arduino. I've tried a number of things, and I keep running into path/compilation problems. I haven't had any luck in finding anything. Thanks in advance
