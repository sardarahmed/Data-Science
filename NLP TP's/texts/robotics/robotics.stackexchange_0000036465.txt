A:

Hi,
we were recently trying to do the same with our B21-robot and by comparing the code with the Player-Stage code from which it was ported from, we found a fix for some hardware-bug. Applying  that patch to the ROS-code solved it for us. (see: http://answers.ros.org/question/1863/rflexb21-cmd_vel-not-working-as-expected )
You can get the patch here:
http://ias.cs.tum.edu/~kargm/rflex_driver.patch
and apply it to rflex_driver.cc in your reflex ROS-package. Let me know it this solved it for you.
