Q:

Using OMPL with turtlebot

My intention in to implement an algorithm for path planning to Turtlebot. I'd like to implement the RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) planner using OMPL Library.
Is it possible? or discouraged me to do this?
Thanks

Hello,
Please take a look at the list of planners already implemented in OMPL:

RRT is already part of OMPL, so I think you need not bother re-implementing it.

Do you know if there is any package in Hydro that allows to use OMPL planner? I'd like to navigate Turtlebot with a RRT planner.
