Q:

xacro: in-order processing became default in ROS MeLodic

I have exported an urdf file from solidwork and change it into xacro file ,but I meet some troubles when i launched it.
The original urdf file(display.launch) can be launched normally. When I launch my xacro file, it can't works.
The problem is within the used launch file (robot.launch):
<launch>
  <arg name="model" default="$(find xacro)/xacro --inorder '$(find myarm)/urdf/xacro/total.xacro'" />
  <arg  name="gui"  default="True" />

  <param name="robot_description" command="$(arg model)" />
  
  <param name="use_gui"   value="$(arg gui)" />

  <node  name="joint_state_publisher"  pkg="joint_state_publisher"  type="joint_state_publisher" />
  
  <node  name="robot_state_publisher"  pkg="robot_state_publisher"   type="state_publisher" />

  <node  name="rviz"  pkg="rviz"   type="rviz"   args="-d $(find model)/urdf.rviz" />
</launch>

The log is following.

If this is really a copy&paste from the console output, you completely messed up your ROS Path. Then, there is something seriously wrong... Please double check the console output again and make sure to c'n'p without any stray whitespace characters or something renaming melodic to meLodtc...
Also, have you tried to run the command that has been provided?
Last but not least, urdf and xacro are different formats, after all. It might also help if you showed the file producing the error....
Comment by Heho on 2020-03-30:
Sorry, the log was upload on windows OS(Graph to text). I am sure that nothing wrong with my ROS path...
Now I have updated the consult output from the log file and my xacro file.
Comment by mgruhler on 2020-03-31:
Now you got rid of the command that you should run, okay...
The path looks better now.
So, how do you launch it? Judging from the console output, this seems to be rather a problem of the launch file then the xacro. There is no mention of the xacros in any of the logs.
It would be beneficial if you could provide a (not) working example with that we can reproduce the problem. If you cannot share the full source code, start by trimming away unnecessary stuff from the xacro and launch files until you identify what causes the problem. If you can then share the files this would help debugging a lot...
Comment by Heho on 2020-03-31:
I have upload the whole package to GitHub(same link)."display.launch" can run normally while "robot.launch " can't work.

A:

The problem is only within your  robot.launch (I've updated your question).
<node  name="rviz"  pkg="rviz"   type="rviz"   args="-d $(find model)/urdf.rviz" />

should be $(find myarm).
