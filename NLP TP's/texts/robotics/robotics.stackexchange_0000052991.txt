Q:

rosbag will not create bag file

Hi everyone!
I am running rosbag from a launch file, and the terminal says the process starts cleanly.  After ending the process however, I cannot find the bag file and all my data is lost.  Here is the launch file:
<launch>
    <include file="$(find AK_Loc)/launch/ak_localize.launch" />
    
    <node name="Command_Predictor" pkg="cmd_predictor" type="TL_Predictor.py" />

    <node pkg="rosbag" type="record" name="cmds" args="-o act_and_pred_cmds /actCmds /cmdPreds" />

</launch>

and I am running ROS Groovy on Ubuntu 12.04.
Any ideas?  Thanks in advance!

A:

Try find ~/.ros -name \*.bag.
