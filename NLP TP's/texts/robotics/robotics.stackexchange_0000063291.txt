Q:

Installing Hydro & Fuerte

I'm attempting to install Hydro & Fuerte on ubuntu 12.04.
I'm wandering that they are interfering with themselves.
I am completely new to linux, so any help would be greatly appreciated

A:

If I understood it correctly, you can only have 1 installation active at the same time, but both can be installed on the same system.
You can switch between the active installation via source /opt/ros/<hydro or fuerte>/setup.bash. You either enter this line in each new terminal you open, or you edit your /home/<your_username>/.bashrc to include corresponding source-command. In  this case, it is sourced automaticly each time you open a terminal.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

That's all correct. Just make sure you source only one setup.bash at a time.
