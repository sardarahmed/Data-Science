Q:

Compile rosmatlab with winros on Windows 7 (catkin_make)

Hi again,
I finally got to compile winros with another Boost version (in the end it was just ridiculously easy...), but now I don't know how to substitute the command
catkin_make -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MATLAB_ROOT/ros/groovy -DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON -DBOOST_ROOT=$MATLAB_ROOT/ros/groovy install

described here with winros_make, since I don't know how to pass those arguments to winros_make so that it redirects them to the internal call to cmake.
Is there anybody who solved this or has suggestions? I read about putting the arguments in either a configure.cmake or findboost.cmake file, but since I'm not yet familiar with cmake, I wasn't able to handle that by now.
Greets and big thanks in advance!

A:

You can see [here](http://wiki.ros.org/win_ros/hydro/Msvc Compiled SDK) the three steps for a winros_xxx process. After the  [winros_init_build](http://wiki.ros.org/win_ros/hydro/Msvc Compiled SDK#Build) step you'll have a config.cmake file which you can edit, change and add any new variables for the cmake build you want (this is equivalent to piling them onto the catkin_make or cmake command line).

I probably missed the --install step, but already worked around this by calling nmake install from within the build library. Thanks a lot anyway!
