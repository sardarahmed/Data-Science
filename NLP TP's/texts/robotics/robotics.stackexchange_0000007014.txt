Q:

What main factors/features explain the high price of most industrial computer vision hardware?

I am a student who is currently working on a computer science project that will require soon computer vision and more specifically stereoscopy (for close depth detection). I am now looking for a great camera to do the job and I found several interesting options:
1- A custom built set of two cheap cameras (i.e. webcam);
2- The old, classic, economic and proven Kinect;
3- Specialized stereo sensors.
I found a couple months ago this sensor: https://duo3d.com/product/duo-mini-lv1
I tought it was interesting because it is small, stereoscopic and brand new (encouraging a fresh USA company). However, if we take apart the additional APIs that come with it, I just don't understand why you would buy this when a Kinect (or "cheap" cameras) are at least 4-5 times less expensive and still have great if not better specifications.
Same applies for this one: http://www.ptgrey.com/bumblebee2-firewire-stereo-vision-camera-systems
Can someone please explain to me why I would need such a device and if not, why they are needed for some?

A:

So the Kinect uses a set of IR points to determine depth, not true stereoscopy. the DUO M and the Bumbee both use two cameras to achieve this, I am not familiar enough with them to give a good comparison between them and the Kinect but I am familiar with a new product that I have been using for a little bit called the ZED It has a detection range of approximately 30M vs the Kinect's 1.2â€“3.5 m, the ZED can operate outdoors, the Kinect cannot due to it's IR based ranging. However the difference is that the ZED needs significant processing power to do the image processing at a reasonable rate, it uses the GPU functions in OpenCV to accomplish this, I am using it with an nvidia K1 board on a Quadcopter. The advantages I outlined with the ZED hold true for most dual camera stereoscopic  setups.
