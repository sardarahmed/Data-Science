Q:

joystick teleop causes segmentation fault

joy_node runs fine but teleop_node causes segmentation fault. Also tried it with joystick_teleop_node and it does the same thing. I have the Husky simulator running in Gazebo and Rviz but I wanted to control Husky with an Xbox controller and I can't get these other nodes to work. I have Ubuntu 14.4 and am using ROS Indigo.

Which joystick_teleop_node are you referring to specifically?
Comment by Rodolfo8 on 2017-02-15:
The one from utexas bwi repository. I tried this one because it had worked for me last year on this same laptop. I tried these two nodes without Gazebo and Rviz loaded but it still faulted.

Could I ask you to please always include either a reference or a link to the specific pkg(s) you are using?
As for SEGFAULTs, a gdb backtrace is almost an obligation. Could you add one? Can't guarantee that will help, but it's a good start.

I will try following this tutorial and see what happens.

So far I don't have experience with gdb backtrace.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-15:
Does joystick_teleop_node SEGFAULT when you run it with just joy but without any of the other nodes / programs (ie: Gazebo and RViz)?

A:

If you don't want to diagnose the problem, but rather work-around it, then I'd recommend using teleop_twist_joy. It's a standard pkg for joystick teleoperation.
Unless you want to educate yourself, writing yet another teleop node seems unnecessary.
