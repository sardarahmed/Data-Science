Q:

ROSserial has its own serial packet format, How to write a node that supports RS-232 packet format (basic serial packet) to communicate via USB port?

Ros serial has its own serial packet format; I think, that does not supports the RS-232 packet format.
This is the reason that on every embedded hardware we need to install a rosserial_client program (a program compiled in hex code for specific target). 
I have a robot base already designed using PIC microcontroller and can be controlled by sending command to the USB port means simply sending the serial data in ASCII code on USB port.
Please suggest me to write a node. Or if some one can share a sample node for the same it will be a learning platform.

I tried that too, I wish you give more insight. Will be thankful.

maybe you should write in the CMake way to your package include directory or where you put this header file
