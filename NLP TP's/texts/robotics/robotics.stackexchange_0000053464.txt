Q:

SSH error when launching nodes on another machine

We added this line to our launch file in order to run a node on another machine:
<machine name="robot" address="robot.dynamic.edu" env-loader="/opt/ros/groovy/env.sh" user="turtlebot"/>

The problem is we get this error:
robot.dynamic.edu is not in your SSH known_hosts file.

Please manually:
   ssh turtlebot@robot.dynamic.edu

then try roslaunching again.

If you wish to configure roslaunch to automatically recognize unknown hosts, please set the environment variable ROSLAUNCH_SSH_UNKNOWN=1

Our environment variable is set to:
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# generated from catkin/cmake/templates/env.sh.in

if [ $# -eq 0 ] ; then
   /bin/echo "Usage: env.sh COMMANDS"
   /bin/echo "Calling env.sh without arguments is not supported anymore. Instead spawn a subshell and source a setup file manually."
   exit 1
else
  . "/opt/ros/groovy/setup.sh"
  exec "$@"
fi

A:

Linux doesn't know what computer robot.dynamic.edu refers to, and so you have to tell it. You do so by editing your /etc/hosts file like they do in this explanation.
