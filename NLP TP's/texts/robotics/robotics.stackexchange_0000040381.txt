Q:

Core dump at Gazebo startup

I try the following terminal command.
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
I get the following error
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
[empty_world_server-1] process has died [pid 3395, exit code 132, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/scripts/gazebo /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo_worlds/worlds/empty.world __name:=empty_world_server __log:=/home/chartoin/.ros/log/26f27722-9b42-11e1-b127-3859f9dbd9aa/empty_world_server-1.log].

This error happens on a Thinkpad x120e laptop with an AMD Fushion e 350 APU. The same command works well when I use a Dell XPS 15 laptop with intel processor and nvidia graphics card.

I get this on a Ubuntu 12.04 system and Nvidia graphics card (GF110 [GeForce GTX 560 Ti] (rev a1) using the 64-bit 295.41 dev drivers).  But it works on my 12.04 laptop with an AMD card  (ATI RV730 XT [Mobility Radeon HD 4670 ).  Update - no it crashes the same way after a few minutes.

@lucasw do you think it's got to do with the drivers? been following the issue on this thread: http://answers.ros.org/question/33449/gazebo-illegal-instruction

A:

I get the same Error with Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and ROS Fuerte.
On the same laptop with Ubuntu 11.10 64bit and ROS Electric everything works like a charm, so if there have not been any major changes to the graphics driver in Ubuntu 12.04 I would say it's a problem with gazebo.
As stated in this thread Klick it may relate to issues with gazebo which should be solved with an update, but my system is up-to-date and I still get the same error.
Update:
Created an remastered Ubuntu distribution with ROS and everything of my current system. When I boot from live usb stick and run gazebo on my second notebook (Intel graphics card) everything is just fine...
So perhaps back to an hardware issue.
