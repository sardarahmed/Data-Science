A:

From your last logfile (http://pastebin.com/RCKePPas):
[roslaunch][ERROR] 1969-12-31 17:01:13,760: OSError(8, Exec format error)
[roslaunch][ERROR] 1969-12-31 17:01:13,763: Unable to launch [rosout-1].

... seems to be the relevant error. I don't know anything about the BeagleBoard but since it's not x86 (correct?) I'm guessing you have some cross-compilation issues.

Almost certainly the case.  Beagleboard is an ARM board. There has been some work started over here: http://dave.limoilux.org/trac/wiki/ROS/CrossCompile/arm but it's far from complete.  You can probably also work off the gumROS guide: http://www.ros.org/wiki/gumros as a starter.
