Q:

ardrone_autonomy; rosmake error

Hi!
Im am amateur programmer and new to ROS, so please bear with me.
I have been trying to install ardrone_autonomy on ROS electric, Ubuntu 11.10 version running on a virtual machine.
Every time I try the ROSMAKE command I get the following error:
Failed to find rosdep libsdl-dev for package ardrone_autonomy on OS:ubuntu version:oneiric
WARNING: Rosdeps [u'libsdl-dev'] could not be resolved
.
.
.
.

[ rosmake ] Halting due to failure in package ardrone_autonomy.

[ rosmake ] WARNING: Rosdep did not detect the following system dependencies as installed: libsdl-dev Consider using --rosdep-install option or rosdep install ardrone_autonomy
I tried to install rosdep separately as suggested, tried to independently install libsdl-dev and every other corresponding file. After having referred to a few answers and questions already posted, I also tried to alter certain lines in 'manifest.xml', 'CMakelists.txt' and 'rosdep.yaml' as suggested but to no effect.
Please help.
Thank you!

A:

Try installing libsdl-dev using synaptic manager and then install the package.
