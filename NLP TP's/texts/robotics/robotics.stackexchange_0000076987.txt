Q:

how to monitor topic, when a certain topic not exist?

Hello,
I want to do a such thing : To  monitor a topic .
When everything is OK, a certain topic is always published by node A at a rate. when something wrong ,the node A is died,and the  topic does  not exist .At this time ,how can i know this topic  exist or not ?
Does ROS has  such API to monitor a topic ,when it does not exist ,notify me and i can use this signal  to do something i want.
Any suggestions will be appreciated ,thank you  very much !!!

A:

The subscriber knows to how many publishers it is connected to:
getNumPublishers
Or you use rospy to directly get a list of published topics: get_published_topics.
