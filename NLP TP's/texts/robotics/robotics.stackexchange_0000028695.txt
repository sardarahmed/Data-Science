Q:

How to get a model position in Gazebo World Plugin?

I am writing a Gazebo World Plugin where I need an information about the position of certain model with respect to world origin. I am using Gazebo-9 and for this version of Gazebo I didn't find any working solution. Can anybody tell me how to achieve this?

A:

// Get model
auto model = _world->ModelByName("model_name");
// Get pose
auto pose = model->WorldPose();

Checking the API documentation should help you in the future:
