Q:

qt_gui_main() found multiple plugins matching

The error in the subject prevents the rqt plugin from running.
$ pwd
/home/noodlerv/cws_viz
$ rospack find rqt_launch                                                                                                                                  
/home/noodlerv/cws_viz/src/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/rqt_launch
$ rospack find rqt_launchtree                                                                                                                               
/home/noodlerv/cws_viz/src/pschillinger/rqt_launchtree
$ rqt --standalone rqt_launch
qt_gui_main() found multiple plugins matching "rqt_launch"
rqt_launch.launch_plugin.LaunchPlugin
rqt_launchtree.launchtree_plugin.LaunchtreePlugin
$ rosversion qt_gui
0.2.32
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
Release:        14.04
Codename:       trusty

The above example is using source but this happens also with installed binaries.
Since rqt_launchtree is introduced later than rqt_launch, I looked into rqt_launchtree to see if anything that qt_gui might reference to to lead into the raised error (e.g. exact string rqt_launch) but failed to find anything suspicious. Therefore I assume this error occurs because of the current spec of qt_gui.
Is there anyway to avoid this error without changing package name and anything that affects api and/or existing applications?

A:

The string you pass to --standalone needs to uniquely identify one plugin. In this case you could achieve that by passing rqt --standalone rqt_launch. (note the trailing dot to make it unique). Obviously rqt --standalone rqt_launchtree.launchtree_plugin.LaunchtreePlugin would work too.
