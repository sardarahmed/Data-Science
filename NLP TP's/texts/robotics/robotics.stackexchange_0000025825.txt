Q:

100% CPU use when physics paused and GUI closed

When I pause physics from GUI, close the GUI, then Gazebo still takes 100% of one core.
Experiencing this with Gazebo 1.2.5 (came with ROS Groovy), have not tried with other versions.
Why? Any way to fix this?

This was not fixed. It's happening to me in Gazebo 4.1.1.
