Q:

Robotics Structure

I am a kind of a new developer and a beginner in Robotics and AI. I am currently learning using the Arduino Uno starter kit. My knowledge on C & C++ is on the beginner's level but i get the whole idea and flow of data.

I want to build a mini robot that can behave as a pedestrian. Navigate within a city as a pedestrian using a GPS system. It will have to "walk" any kind of terrain that it will encounter in a city e.g pavement, stairs e.t.c.

My question is, having in mind that it will never have to charge itself, what is the best build system in order for that robot to be able to do that? What kind of sensors will be needed apart from camera(visual)?

I know this is a very general question. I am very new to this so please bare with me. Any information and guidance much appreciated.

A:

Look at the Duckietown project.  It is a robot (the Duckiebot) and an urban environment for learning about robotics and autonomy.  There is an Edx MOOC and curriculum designed for undergraduate university level.  The Duckiebot can be purchased as a kit from the Duckietown org, or you can build your own DIYDuckie.  Duckiebot is based on Python and ROS2 and and is open source.  ROS is pretty complex for an introduction to robots.  You might also try Donkeycar which is a popular python framework for creating autonomous racing cars from an RC (I'm a maintainer on that project).  As a first robot, this project that I created is easy to build and inexpensive (about $40 in parts); it includes a camera and can be extended in JavaScript.
