Q:

ROS beginner tutorials:Writing Simple Service and Client (C++) - need explanation

I'm following the ROS beginner tutorials and currently doing 14.Writing Simple Service and Client (C++) (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28c%2B%2B%29)
In Section 1.2 Writing the Client Node, the following lines of code have not been explained:
   8   if (argc != 3)
   9   {
  10     ROS_INFO("usage: add_two_ints_client X Y");
  11     return 1;
  12   }

Can anyone tell me why this comparison is made? Thanks in advance.
P.S.I'm using ROS groovy on Ubuntu 12.10. Following catkin tutorials.

A:

Hi,
argc refers to total number of arguments that can be passed to a node. In your case, when you run rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_client 5 6, you enter three arguments add_two_ints_client(argv[0]),5(argv[1]) and 6(argv[2]). For the node add_two_ints to function properly second and third arguments, the integers, are required along with node name. The comparison, if (argc != 3) is made to check if the required number of arguments needed to run the client are obtained. If you use rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_client 5 (argc = 2)or rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_client 5 6 7 ((argc = 4),  usage: add_two_ints_client X Y will appear.
