Q:

Linking external libraries to ROS

Hi all, I know this is something every c++ programmer has to know, but i'm java programmer and just started learning C++ and ROS.
If I have compiling flags like the following to compile a C++ program (not in ROS), how do I integrate this to a ROS program and modify my manifest or CMakeFiles?
 -l Festival -I/usr/include/festival  -I/usr/lib/speech_tools/include -leststring -lestools -lestbase 
EDIT: and are there any other settings that I have to do? like, setting dependencies for example (if that even makes sense)?

A:

Not sure if it is the best way I did this with the following in CMakeLists.txt
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -I/usr/include/festival -I/usr/lib/speech_tools/include")

For linking target libraries
target_link_libraries(example rt
python2.6
other_libraries)

I see you put in the -I (includes) flags, but where do we put the -L (libraries) ?? I don't understand your second section of code. Could you please, explain? thanks @ravenll, really..

I think this page explains the procedure.

Uh, I did not see this link before. This keeps on happening to me. Where do they put all these intermediate tutorial links? or do you have to know the specific link to the secret page :) ? Thanks btw, ravenll..
