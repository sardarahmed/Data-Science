Q:

rgbdslam and octomap

Hello everyone, I am using ros fuerte on ubuntu 12.04 and have few questions:

Does anyone know how rgbdslam and octomap cooperates?

Is there any possibility to manipulate with map created by rgbdslam?

Is there a possibility to build octomap with octomap_server out of rgbdslam algorithm and visualise it?

Is there possibility to reduce the size of created map? for example to 1-2 meters around robot?

Hi.

There are two possibilities:  (a)  Have rgbdslam send out the clouds+tf transformations and let the octomap_server listen or (b) Use the GUI of rgbdslam to save the map as an octomap (no need to run octomap_server)
No. You can manipulate the octomap using octovis - though this functionality is quite limited.
See 1.
You can (a) set the parameter 'maximum_depth" for rgbdslam (though this will also limit the use of faraway visual features during mapping)
or (b) set the max_sensor_range parameter for the octomap_server (only affects map rendering)

Do I need an experimental version of octomap- when I save the map with:  rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver file.ot   I see only a blue cube but if I save it with rgbdslam GUI I can see map. I am working with rosbag files (rgbd_dataset_freiburg2_pioneer_360.bag).

The blue cube means no data. So I guess that the data you send from rgbdslam does not arrive at the octomap server.

When i use the GUI to save the octomap it saves as .pcd file. Furthermore, when i try to visualize the point cloud i got an error: No points to read. Like you said, i guess the data sent from rgbdslam did not arrive to octomap server. Do you know how can i fix that ?

I do not have this problem. Can you just try to rename the file to .ot?
Comment by Thiagopj on 2015-01-12:
Yes, i tried! Using octovis to visualize, the file is empty

To clarify, I meant the file saved from the GUI. What is the file size? Any output on the terminal concerning the saving of the octomap?
