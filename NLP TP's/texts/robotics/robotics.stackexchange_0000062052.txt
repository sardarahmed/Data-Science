Q:

can "rosbag filter" create a new bag file with multiple topics within it?

Hello,
I have a bagfile with a lot of topics in it.
For some reason I would like to filter out 4 topics of that bagfile into a new bagfile:
   rosbag filter old_bag.bag new_bag.bag "topic=='/stereo/left/image_rect' '/stereo/right/image_rect' '/stereo/left/camera_info'  '/stereo/right/camera_info'"

Unfortunately this doesn't work. Does anyone have a clue what the correct syntax is?

A:

The filter statement is just python, so you can use or:
rosbag filter old_bag.bag new_bag.bag "topic == '/stereo/left/image_rect' or topic == '/stereo/right/image_rect' or topic == '/stereo/left/camera_info' or topic == '/stereo/right/camera_info'"

If you want to record a whole namespace, e.g., "stereo", you can make use of Python's in operator:
rosbag filter old_bag.bag new_bag.bag "'stereo' in topic"
