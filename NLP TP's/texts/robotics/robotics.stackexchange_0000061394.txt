Q:

Could not find a configuration file for package pr2_controller_interface

In the pr2_mechanism tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/pr2_mechanism/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20realtime%20joint%20controller)
it uses 'rosbuild' to build the code which is quite outdated. So in the part 3 of the tutorial, I use 'catkin_make' to build my package instead of using 'rosmake' which is used in the tutorial.  But I overcome two errors:
1. Could not find a configuration file for package pr2_mechanism_model.
2. Could not find a configuration file for package pr2_controller_interface.

I can 'roscd' these two packages so I think they should have been found by catkin_make. Can anyone tell me the solution? Thank you very much.
This is the 'find_package" in my CMakeList.txt:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  pluginlib
  pr2_controller_interface
  pr2_mechanism_model
)

PS. Can anyone update the tutorials to use the new build system catkin_make? And I find that some tutorials are quite outdated and need updating immediately. But since I am new to ROS and PR2, I cannot do more but asking questions.

Which version of ROS are you using? Are the pr2_mechanism_model and pr2_controller_interface packages that you're depending on catkin packages?

I am using groovy on Ubuntu Precise.  I can 'roscd' these two packages which means they are in my system.  And I also 'find_package()' both of them in CMakeList.txt. I think I should modify the CMakeList.txt to make it find the corresponding cmake file, right?

I have added the 'find_package' in my question. You can read it. @ahendrix

A:

The PR2 packages are not catkinized in Groovy. You'll have to use rosbuild.

Could you tell me how to catkinize it? Yes, I try and rosbuild works. Actually it comes to the question of why we should use catkin if rosbuild works to achieve the same goal.
Comment by ahendrix on 2014-08-05:
catkin packages cannot depend on rosbuild packages, and ALL of the PR2 packages in Groovy were rosbuild. You'd have to catkinze all of them. I did this. It was not fun. The catkinized versions of the PR2 packages are released into Hydro.

The reasons for using catkin for released packages are many and varied. See: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview

rosbuild is still supported and works well for a single developer or a small team building packages from source, but it doesn't scale well to released packages.
