Q:

Calibrating in OpenNI_Kinect

Hi all,
I was wondering if it was possible to calibrate the Kinect in the openni_camera package, and if there was a standard way to do this.  I did stumble across the following link:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect_calibration
but noticed that this was associated with a deprecated package (and I was having issues getting that code to compile with the current version of libfreenect).
I also noticed in openni_camera/include several different parameter files that look like they have calibration information (e.g. calibration_rgb.yaml), but I noticed that the launch file openni_camera/openni_node.launch doesn't refer to any of them.  In fact, when I removed those configuration files, everything still worked.  Are these files even read by OpenNI_Camera?  And if they aren't, where does OpenNI_Camera find its intrinsic parameters?
I apologise if I missed some other package out there.
Thanks,
Chris Tralie

Comment by Marco on 2011-10-19:
From what I understand the OpenNI package uses the factory calibration stored on the Kinect. I've been trying to figure out if it is possible to do a manual (better?) calibration but have not succeeded so far to use the data from the Kinect_Calibration in the latest OpenNI driver.

A:

The newer openni_kinect drivers get the factory calibration settings, so calibration is no longer necessary. This is why the calibration tools are associated with the deprecated package, because it doesn't use the factory calibration settings.
