Q:

rosrun cannot find executables under turtlesim

I know this question has been asked many times, but I really wanted to understand what was wrong with my commands and environment setup. I tried solutions from other sources but none worked in my case.
I installed ROS indigo on Raspberry Pi 3 following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
And I am going through beginner tutorials, currently on section "Understanding ROS Nodes" with following link: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes
As I ran command rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node, the terminal gave following output error: [rosrun] Couldn't find executable named turtlesim_node below /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/ros_tutorials/turtlesim
I have added source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash; source ~/ros_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash;in the end of ~/.bashrc file.
Also, my working space is ros_catkin_ws.
As I run rospack profile, it produces following output:
0.065189   /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src
0.029168 * /opt/ros/indigo/share

0.001130   /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/diagnostics
0.000709   /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/ros_comm_msgs
As I run rospack find turtlesim, it successfully find location of the package at /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/ros_tutorials/turtlesim
So can someone give me detailed instructions on how to follow the tutorial and find the executables? Thank you so much.

A:

The location of the turtlesim package is in the dir. opt/ros/indigo/share, you can search turtlesim_node in your catkin workspace to make sure where there is a executable or not.
