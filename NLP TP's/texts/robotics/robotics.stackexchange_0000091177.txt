Q:

ROS2 rmw_connext_cpp in raspberry system (armhf)

Hello,
ROS2 rmw_connext_cpp dependents RTI connext dds, but missing some library about
librticonnextmsgcppd.so in armhf system. However, this library can be found in amd64 system.
The RMW rmw_connext_cpp will be available if no librticonnextmsgcppd.so.
How to install the RTI library like librticonnextmsgcppd.so in armhf system?
Is rti-connext-dds not supported in ROS2 repository in arm system now?
Thanks

A:

If you look at "ROS 2.0 Target Platforms" from REP #2000:
http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html
As of ROS2 Crystal, you'll find the table listing the "Middleware Implementation Support", where rmw_connext_cpp is supported for "All (targeted) Architectures except arm64". No pre-compiled release binaries are available for armhf (i.e. arm32v7) as its not listed among the targeted architectures. You'd also have to contact RTI for arm32 releases of DDS Connext, as I don't think the download for it is publicly distributed.
There was a community request for arm32v7 support, however has yet to gain traction with release maintainers:

However, if your using a raspberry pi 3, there are arm64v8 images you could use so you could install ROS2 from the release arm64 debains:
