Q:

autoware_auto_launch not found

Hi,
I am checkout to setup AVP demo on a new machine. After installing docker/ade I followed the instructions here:
https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/avpdemo.html
When I try to launch autoware_auto_visualization.launch.py I get the following error:
ros2 launch autoware_auto_launch autoware_auto_visualization.launch.py
Package 'autoware_auto_launch' not found: "package 'autoware_auto_launch' not found, searching: ['/opt/AutowareAuto', '/opt/ros/foxy']"
I cannot find the package autoware_auto_launch package anywhere in the repository. Am I missing something?
full logs here: https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2102902

Eventually I managed ti have it working properly.
For some unknown reason, the file was missing in /opt/AutowareAuto/. I couldn't find it either in my src directory. Maybe I was using an old autoware branch? (but as far as know I am only moving between 1.0.0 and master)

Might be related to https://answers.ros.org/question/375372/autowareauto-master-branch-source-code-failed/

A:

There is no src/tools/autoware_auto_launch/launch/autoware_auto_visualization.launch.py in the 1.0.0 release ( https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/tree/1.0.0/tools
)
So release 1.0.0 cannot run the AVP demo as presented in the current documentation
It is necessary to use the old version : https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/blob/1.0.0/docs/usage/odd-demos/autonomous-valet-parking.md

We are currently working on a way to provide multiple versions of the docs in issue #115. You can track this issue for updates.
