Q:

Correct file hierarchy for document generation

I'm attempting to go through the process of contributing a package to the ROS community. From what I've gleaned from various tutorials (like this), a common practice is to create a GitHub account, and create a repository named whatever-ros-pkg. Inside that repository, each directory contains a package (or metapackage). Two questions:

The root level of that repository itself does not represent a ROS package or metapackage, correct? Catkin appears to be displeased when you try to make it one, as the naming convention isn't correct (hyphens instead of underscores).

If my assumption in (1) is correct, then what should I put in the distribution.yaml file for a given ROS distro? Would I put this:
whatever-ros-pkg:
doc:
type: git
url: https://github.com/username/whatever-ros-pkg.git
version: hydro-devel

...or do I need to add every package within the repository and give them the same Git URL? Will the indexer pick up the repo and its constituent packages as it's currently written?

A:

The layout of the packages in a repository is not fixed. You can place a single package into the root of the repo (e.g. https://github.com/ros/genmsg) or you can put packages under a hierarchy of folders (e.g. https://github.com/ros/ros_comm).
The folder name / repository does not have to be identical to the containing package name but usually that is a good idea since that is what a user would usually expect.
