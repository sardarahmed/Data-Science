Q:

How to let KDevelop support ROS project?

I use KDevelop 4.3.1 for ROS Groovy with ubuntu 12.04.
I try to open CMakeLists.txt on KDevelop to open ROS project, but it shows the error that says can't find ros/ros.h.

How to set KDevelop for ROS properly?
Thank you very much~~

Thank you~ You are correct! When I run kdevelop on bash, the ros.h header is found. Please post it as an answer~^^

A:

Have you tried starting KDevelop from within a shell where you have sourced your setup.bash?
