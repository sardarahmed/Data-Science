Q:

Not able to create a map using SLAM Mapping( Kobuki+Hokuyo UST-10LX)

Ive been trying to run the Kobuki slam package on my Kobuki using a Hokuyo UST-10LX connected over ethernet but after running the kobuki_slam package,in Rviz i keep getting map not received warning. The odometry seems to be working though when i move around using teleop.However,no map is created.
I connect the laser using the following command :
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.0.11" scan:=base_scan

If I don`t specify the scan= base_scan parameter i keep getting [frame_id] laser does not exist error on the object of Rviz.
Here`s my rqt_graph at execution :
rqt_graph
And here is my tf_tree
tf_tree
It might not be enough info to go on, but can someone tell me where I am going  wrong with this? Where I should focus on to try and fix this?

A:

Well looking at your TF tree, the error you're seeing is very literal, you don't have a laser frame defined in your TF tree. You need to add one so that a SLAM implementation can transform the laser to base link.

Thanks.That made me realize what was wrong. The static transform was using laser and the slam algorithm was using base_scan. Just had to change them all to laser.
