Q:

Communication between ros and android over usb

I'm try to get the ros to communicate with an android app using a usb cable, so the computer and android app will talk to each other. I can only find examples of where wifi or bluetooth is used. I want to use the usb port. Wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to do this.

A:

Depending on what version of android you're using, you can setup USB networking as "Internet pass-through" which will let you share your computer's network with the android device over USB. This will let you talk to a ROS nodes running on the android device like any other ROS node (or like you were using wifi).
