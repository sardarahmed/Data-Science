Q:

prosilica GC650C

Hello
I am trying to use a prosilica GC650C.
I follow the instructions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/prosilica_camera/Tutorials
The camera works, except for a small detail - images are in grayscale and the camera should give color images.
I launched reconfigure_gui but could not find any parameter regarding video format.
Can anyone help?
regards
Miguel

A:

The prosilica output is in Bayer format; you need to run image_proc to debayer it to produce a color image. See: http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_proc
