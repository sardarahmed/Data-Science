Q:

Are there any books on ROS?

Hello all,
I just wanted to know if there are any books on ROS? I found this:
http://www.amazon.com/OPERATING-SYSTEM-LAMBERT-HENSSONOW-SURHONE/dp/6133541857
but it has no cover or description. Does anyone know anything about this book, or any other books?
Thank you, I appreciate the help.

A:

You have more options now (ordered by my preference):

Programming Robots with ROS - Published in 2015. Authors from OSRF and Willow Garage.
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming - Again published in 2015 and has good and updated instruction.
ROS by Example - There are two new versions of this book for Hydro released in January and October 2014. The book is practical and great for beginners as well as those who have some experience!
A Gentle Introduction to ROS - This book covers most of the basics and does it really well. Short and sweet. The online version is free and the print is available on Amazon fairly cheap too. A good reference for beginners.
Learning ROS for Robotics Programming - This book covers the basics too and is more detailed than "A Gentle Introduction to ROS" mentioned above. But this book is based on fuerte and the old rosbuild system.

I would go for #1 or #2 if I were buying a book right now.
Also, there's now a ROS wiki page for books so expect that to be updated - http://wiki.ros.org/Books
