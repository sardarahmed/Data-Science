Q:

install pcl-conversions when pcl is already installed

Nowadays I installed PCL from source code because of a bug in pre-built binaries.
And now I want to install two packages ros-indigo-pcl-ros and ros-indigo-pcl-conversions using apt-get command.
But it says pcl-1.7 will be installed again.
I think installing pcl-1.7 again is redundant because I've already installed it from source code.
Is there any way to let apt-get know pcl-1.7 is already installed and skip installing it?
The resulting message of sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pcl-conversions is as follow.

The following extra packages will be
installed:   libpcl-1.7-all
libpcl-1.7-all-dev libpcl-1.7-bin

A:

The version of pcl_conversions that you can install through apt was compiled against the version of pcl that you can install through apt.
If you want to use pcl_conversions with a version of pcl that you've built from source, you should also build pcl_conversions from source.
