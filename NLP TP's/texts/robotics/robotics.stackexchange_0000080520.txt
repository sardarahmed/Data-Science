Q:

has anyone attended ROS Summer School

So, I am thinking of applying for the ROS Summer School 2017 - https://www.fh-aachen.de/fachbereiche/maschinenbau-und-mechatronik/international/ros/
Has anyone here attended the course, is it worth it (to me it looks like it) - any pointers / suggestions / alternatives ???

A:

Hi,
I haven't but I'm thinking in going this year too, although it is kind of difficult for me because I'm located in the USA. For me, it is worth it for the following reasons:

Networking
500 euros of scholarship
Hands on a real robot using ROS
Sort of vacations
Participation at Urban Challenge Competition
CV?

Other than that it seems to me that the program is too basic and you can learn that stuff by yourself and for free.
Best,
