Q:

rxbag timeline and plots incorrect

I tried rxbag with the bag at:
pr.willowgarage.com/data/gmapping/basic_localization_stage.bag.
The result is in screenshot:
alunos.deec.uc.pt/~a2004110783/rxbag.png
The base_scan topic only shows messages up to 0:08, while there are more, just like tf.
On the plot the translation.y is not getting plotted an instead it is a straight line at y=0.
This is in Fuerte with all the apt-get updates.

A:

Beside rxbag also the new replacement rqt_bag shows the same effect.
The bag file contains one message (at about 0:08) which timestamp is not in-order. You can fix the bag file by calling bagsort YOUR-BAG.bag YOUR-FIXED-BAG.bag.
Unfortunately that bagsort script is currently broken. I already committed a patch - if you don't want to wait for the new release you can just apply the simple fix from https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/42 manually.
