Please update your post with the complete error message.

A:

Where did you get irb_moveit_config from?
The file moveit_planning_execution.launch is a non-standard file, added by ROS-Industrial to MoveIt packages for industrial robots.

Well, you'll have to add the moveit_planning_execution.launch file yourself. resource not found sounds like the launch file is referring to something that doesn't exist?
