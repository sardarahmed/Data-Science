Q:

Kinect for Windows - No Device connected

Hey :),
i got some issues using a Kinect for Windows.
I find out that this Kinect is not supported by Openni yet. here and here and this command:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

throws an error like this:
[/openni_node1] No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

I tryed to use the unstable version of openni and ps-engine as mentioned at this question but this sill not works.
So the real Question whitch arives. Is there some kind of workaround for this issue?
for advising purposes: The easy solution for this issue was just to take an older Version of Kinect.

A:

Kinect4Windows can be made to work. The links below must help.
link for kinect 4 windows on ubuntu.........or mitchtech

If openni does not build then, install openjdk-7-jre and openjdk-7-jdk
after cd SensorKinect
type git checkout unstable
openni_camera and openni_launch wont wont in the first go and say that this file "XnCppWrapper.h" is missing. Search for it and move all the contents of that folder to the /usr/include/
Never do rosdep for openni_Camera or openni_launch beacuase the unstable openni packages will be replaced by the stable ones..
Finally you can you roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch to get the new Kinect4Windows to work
