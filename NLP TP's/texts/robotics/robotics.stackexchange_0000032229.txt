Q:

prosilica intrinsincs parameters failed to load

Hey All,
I'm experiencing problems with a GC1380C prosilica camera. The camera is connected through a fast Ethernet interface, which I know is not optimal but still the SampleViewer works. I've access to different parameters, I can modify them, I can see the video stream etc...
However, whenever I'm trying to use the camera as follow : roslaunch prosilica.launch, I'm getting error :

The IP address in prosilica.launch is the good one. Any idea what could be the origin of this error ?
Thank you very much,

Thank very much for your help. It tried both methods. I actually have dropped packets.
The log is :

From the Sample Viewer, I tune the packet size to 1500 which seems to work. However, it seems that the driver tries to optimize this size and as a result change it a larger value, which cause the Sample Viewer to crash too. When I use the SDK taken from Prosilica website, I do not encounter such issues using the same fast Ethernet interface. I can't actually change to network interface as I'm using a laptop. I'm currently checking if there is a problem in the driver code.

Hi
Did you find the problem in the end? I am also having problems with the prosilica_camera. I also get "failed to load intrinsics from camera"
