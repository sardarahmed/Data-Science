Q:

Rosserial mbed comunication does not work

Hello,
I am working on Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic. I downloaded rosserial jade-devel since there is no branch for Kinetic. I have read that some people used it and it worked. When I am trying to connect to my STM using
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _baud:=115200

there is an allert:
[ERROR] [1518733110.399872]: Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

I am using mbed online compiler, I tried to change baud rate and library on compiler to both kinetic and jade mbed.
My USB-UART device is connected to ttyUSB0. Is there an official Kinetic rosserial version? Do You have any idea what should I do to fix it and make it run? Thank You for answers.

A:

rosserial_python was a bit unstable when I used it to connect an Arduino to ROS.
Could you try using rosserial_server instead? That worked properly for me.

$ roslaunch rosserial_server
serial.launch

You can see my question here, it might work as an example for you.
