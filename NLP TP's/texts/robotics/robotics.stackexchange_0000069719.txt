Q:

ros jade and gazebo 5.0 migration problem

Hello,
I am trying to upgrade from ros indigo to ros jade. I followed the following procedure
sudo apt-get get remove ros-indigo-desktop-full

then
sudo apt-get get install ros-jade-desktop-full

However, when I am trying to launch a simulation with gazebo I obtain the following error

/opt/ros/jade/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver: 22: .: Can't open /share/gazebo//setup.sh

/opt/ros/jade/lib/gazebo_ros/gzclient: 17: .: Can't open /share/gazebo//setup.sh

[gazebo-2]
process has died [pid 5171, exit code
2, cmd
/opt/ros/jade/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver
-e ode /home/mago/Projects/2015a_Nicastro_HeterogeneousMultirobot/src/uav/worlds/vtol.world
__name:=gazebo __log:=/home/mago/.ros/log/0b588c00-6078-11e5-b34f-f04da268d7ae/gazebo-2.log]. log file:
/home/mago/.ros/log/0b588c00-6078-11e5-b34f-f04da268d7ae/gazebo-2*.log

Apparently it can't find the file  /share/gazebo//setup.sh
I noticed the double slash, therefore I tried to search the setup.sh file manually.
However, the command
ls /usr/share/ | grep gazebo

gives

gazebo-3.0

gazebo-5.0

Moreover, in the "gazebo-5.0" folder there is no file "setup.sh"
I think something went wrong during the installation, I tried to remove everything and reinstall but without success.
Can anyone help me?
EDIT: I tried the workaround described here, but apparently I have libgazebo5-dev already installed.

Hi, installing the gazebo5 package seems to have solved the problem. However I do not understand why this was necessary. Isn't the package  ros-jade-desktop-full supposed to install it?
Thank anyway
Andrea
