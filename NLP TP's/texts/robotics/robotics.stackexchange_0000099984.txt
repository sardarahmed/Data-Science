Q:

started roscore with different URI but when launched launch file a new ros core was started

Hi
I was trying to run on one machine two nodes in parallel, so I started the first node with "roscore" and on a different terminal a new roscore with
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11312
roscore --port 11312
but then when I launched a launch file it looked for the regular roscore
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
saw it wasn't started in the terminal so stsrted it
How can I make my nodes run with the new roscore?
Thanks

A:

Did you export ROS_MASTER_URI in the terminal/Bash session where you ran roslaunch?
