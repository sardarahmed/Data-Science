Q:

how to create a new model using Gazebo's xml language?

I following the tutorial http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=camera_save&cat=sensors to save images on the disk. But I do not know what code can I use to custom model or the world. For instance, 1. how to change the filename of saved images? 2. how to save only one latest image always. Because I do not want there are millions of images in my disk hours later. So I just want to save the one image per second and replace the old image instead of new image each second with the same filename.

A:

As for the title, this tutorial shows how to create a velodyne lidar. The xml format gazebo uses is called sdformat and the specification is available here.
The name of the file comes from the name of the sensor. In the tutorial the images have the name default_camera_link_my_camera. default is because that's the name of the <world>. camera is the name of the <model> the sensor is on. link is the name of the <link> the sensor is on. my_camera is the name of the <sensor>. I don't think there is a way to tell gazebo to replace an old image with a new one without writing some code.
It can be done if you write a custom plugin to save the image. There are some general tutorials about creating plugins here. Once you're familiar with those I recommend using the camera plugin source code as a starting point.
