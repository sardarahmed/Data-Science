Q:

vslam: where is the file " current.rtc"?

I would like to run vslam on my own datasets, but it can not find the current.rtc.
I checked the 'data' folder, no current.rtc inside.
However, my stereo data runs smoothly on the ROS:vslam using the original setting file "stereo_vslam.launch".
My question is what the current.rtc is? How could I find it?

A:

Just in case some newbies have the same problem: the "current.rtc" comes from the other package "calonder_descriptor", so the solution is simple: install this package from the source.
