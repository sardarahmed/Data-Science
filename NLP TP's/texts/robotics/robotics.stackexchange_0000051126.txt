Q:

jenkins fails to build with "No such file or directory"

I've asked about similar issue that happens on local catkin_make.
Now it's solved, but with the same pkgs that I discussed there, I'm seeing similar issue happening on jenkins that complains the .h file from .msg is not found, although the console output implies it is built. Here's the excerpt from jenkins' output:
Executing command 'make'

compilation terminated.

What's wrong?
The rendition of the sources that were used for building: rqt_cpp_common, rqt_marble
By the way, the pkg that tries to refer to the missing .h file, rqt_marble pkg, is not even released. It just resides within the source repo of the metapkg being built. So I'm not expecting that this particular pkg to be built but I feel I should open a new thread for it.

A:

Your title is misleading. The problem is not that the file doesn't exist, the problem is that you are missing the dependency on rqt_cpp_common from your rqt_marble CMakeLists.txt in the find_package catkin line.

After adding rqt_cpp_common in find_package, looks like jenkins stops failing (the latest build says unstable, not failure). I also modified the title accordingly.
