Q:

how to call pause_physics service

i cant seem to do:
pause_physics_client=rospy.ServiceProxy('/gazebo/pause_physics',PausePhysics)

there doesn't seem to be a PausePhysics.srv anywhere under gazebo_msgs/srv
I can see that the service is running in rosservice list, and I'm using groovy.
What should I be doing instead? All I want is a way to toggle physics inside my code.

A:

gazebo/pause_physics is an Empty service (no inputs or output arguments), so doesn't need its own service definition.  See this section from the wiki page:
~/pause_physics (std_srvs/Empty)
    Pause physics updates. 

~/unpause_physics (std_srvs/Empty)
    Resume physics updates. 

Try this and see if it works:
from std_srvs.srv import Empty
pause_physics_client=rospy.ServiceProxy('/gazebo/pause_physics',Empty)

If you need it, gazebo/unpause_physics is also an Empty service.
