Q:

transforms for laser

I recently wrote a ROS node for an older hokuyo laser.  I wrote my own node because my laser is older and uses a protocol that is not supported by the hokuyo_node ROS package.  My node is successfully publishing laserscan messages and I would like to view the laser scans in RViz.  I'm having a problem viewing the data in RViz.  The error I get is: Transform [sender=/hokuyo_pub]
For frame [robot_pose_ekf/odom]: Frame [robot_pose_ekf/odom] does not exist
I think the problem involves transforms.  I had to specify a frameid in the header of my laserscan message.  I wasn't sure what to put here but tried: robot_pose_ekf/odom.  I am using turtlebot.
Thanks for any advice!

A:

Ideally, I would suggest that you write a transform publisher for your laser scanner using the tutorials located in the tf package. You must publish the laser scan data in a frame that exists on your Turtlebot. If you don't know what these frames are,  you can use the following to see all of the transforms published on your robot:
rosrun tf view_frames
