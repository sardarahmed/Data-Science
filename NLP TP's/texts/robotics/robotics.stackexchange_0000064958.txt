Q:

Problem using turtlebot + kinect

Good Morning!
I'm facing some troubles to create an octomap using RGBDSLAM with kinect in a turtlebot, without GUI.
Every time when i stop to capturing frames and send the data to octomap_server, something unusual happen, the octomap only contains the last frame captured.
I've already tried to create the octomap with kinect only, and it worked! But running turtlebot + kinect i can't create a full octomap from the area.
My steps were:
Running turtlebot roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch 
And the controls roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
Running Openni roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch 
And the rgbdslam / octomap_server  roslaunch rgbdslam headless.launch roslaunch rgbdslam octomap_server.launch 
After the capture ends i send data to octomap_server, and then run octomap_saver
PS.: I don't think the problem is related to the capture process, because the memory raises when the process starts and stabilize when it stops
Thanks for help!

A:

Hi,
You can debug the problem by something like rostopic echo /rgbdslam/batch_clouds/header, which will show you which/how many clouds rgbdslam sends out.
What hardware are you using? The communication between rgbdslam and octomap server is known to be brittle on slow machines and when the data needs to be transfered between machines.
Which version of RGBDSLAM are you using? The hydro version on github lets you save the octomap without the octomap_server by using the octomap library directly.

I'm using RGBDSLAM v2 on hydro version, i guess the problem was related to the "send_cloud_rate" parameter somehow, i just decreased the rate and it worked!
I'll debug to confirm if that was the problem, Thanks!

The send_cloud_rate just throttles the sending to x clouds per second. Probably the octomap server or the network couldn't keep up. If octomap server is using 100% of a single CPU core, consider to lower the resolution of the octomap.

Hi, I started working on rgbd slam with TurtleBot, ros hydro Ubunto 12.04 I followed this link:http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/ to install rgbd slam, and after I had a GUI window as the window exactly in this link,

i think it was a problem with topics in launch files can some one help me and send to me the launch of openni+rgbdslam.launch openni.launch rgbdslam.launch
