Q:

rosserial does not work on Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric

I installed Ubuntu 11.10 and tried to install ros. Only the ros-electric-common could be installed (not the desktop version) but I thought this may be enough for rosserial (To try with my Arduino communication).
But there is a dependancy-problem. Could not install rosserial because I was missing geometry, which can not be loaded because the package libglut3-dev is replaced by freeglut3-dev (see ticket 4963 from 5 months ago).
Could a developer change this dependency please, or give me a workaround for this problem, so I can use my Arduino with ROS. This was the only dependency that was NOK so this would help me very much

A:

Debs are still building for much of 11.10 -- these issues will get worked out.
Also, for future note, it is probably more helpful to note that you have a problem with "geometry" not "rosserial". rosserial is one of many, many packages that depend on geometry, but the rosserial developers are not going to be able to help you fix a problem with geometry building (and geometry is a legitimate dependency of rosserial).
If you want to temporarily build rosserial on a broken ROS install, you could do the following:

Do a source checkout of rosserial (using hg).
Edit rosserial_arduino/CMakeLists.txt and rosserial_arduino/manifest.xml to remove references to geometry_msgs.
Run "make" in that local folder (make sure rosserial is on your ROS package path).

Note that none of the examples that use geometry_msgs will work.
