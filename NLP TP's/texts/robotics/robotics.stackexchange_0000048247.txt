Q:

tf installation problem

Hello,
I have been trying to start working with tf.
I followed this tutorial
http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf
But I get this error
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource turtle_tf
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks

when I try to run
rosdep install turtle_tf rviz

Any suggestions will be appreciated.
Thanks!

A:

The reason for this is that ROS is not able to find turtlesim package. Either package is not installed  path to ros package directory is not correctly defined. Try command "roscd turtlesim" and see whether ur directed to turtlesim folder.

Sorry check for "turtle_tf" pacakge instead of turtlesim..

There is no such package "turtle_tf". I had to install its stack first using this line:     sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-geometry-tutorials. Now it's working
