Q:

Is it possible to use a pre-built map?

Hi everyone,
I apologize in advance if my question is either inaccurate, stupid, or inappropriate.
Please consider me as a newbie in ROS related subject.
I have quickly been through the navigation tutorial and if I correctly understand the logic behind the navigation stack it is possible for it to use an external map (static_map seems to be the correct name). Since my robot will evolve in a rather static environment I would like to provide it with a manually pre-built map of this environment.

Is it possible ?

If it is indeed possible how can I do it ? (see below) Answered
The specifications of the map file are here:
http://wiki.ros.org/map_server

I thank you in advance for your answers and your advice.
EDIT 2:
Link to the map we built with the corresponding yml file.

A:

I think i can't really understand what are you mean , Do you want : (1) load a 2D pre-built map to ROS map server and use this map to test robot navigation package? or (2) Simulate a 3D environment and let robot use this simulator environment to build a map then using to navigation stack .
if the situation (1) : follow @Andromeda 's answer , and i think the "arbotix" simulator and "rbx1" package which you can find in http://wiki.ros.org will help you .
(2) : can't find any tutorial already exist , but you can try to use gazebo_world_edit & ros_plugin , some tutorial link: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials ,hope it will useful ~

Thank you.
Your first assumption is correct (ie:"(1) load a 2D pre-built map to ROS map server and use this map to test robot navigation package.").
However it is not for tests, the final robot will use it for navigation.

I think may be you should use a launch file to load your map (.yaml & .pgm) to your ros map_server package then use it in navigation stack . but I am not sure , hope it can help you ~
