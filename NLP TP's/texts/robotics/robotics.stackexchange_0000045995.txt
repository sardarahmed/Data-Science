Q:

Using Hokuyo node with multiple lasers

I've got two Hokuyo laser scanners, both of which work individually when I run the hokuyo_node and change to the appropriate port. However, I'd like to have them both running at the same time, publishing to two different topics. How do I go about this?

A:

You need to remap topic name on at least one of the nodes, and give deffirent names to them. Easiest way is use launch file:
<launch>
    <node name="hokuyo0" pkg="hokuyo_node" type="hokuyo_node">
        <param name="port" type="string" value="/dev/ttyACM0" />
        <remap from="scan" to="scan0" />
    </node>
    <node name="hokuyo1" pkg="hokuyo_node" type="hokuyo_node">
        <param name="port" type="string" value="/dev/ttyACM1" />
        <remap from="scan" to="scan1" />
    </node>
</launch>

How would one use tf in THIS code to rotate the frame of the second hokuyo by 180', so the messages publihsed to /scan by the second hokuyo are rotated?
