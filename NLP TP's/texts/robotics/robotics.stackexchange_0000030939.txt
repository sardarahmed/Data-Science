Q:

segfault after failed call do `GetParentLink`: collada_joint_publisher with diamondback

Hi everyone!
My name is Ivan, and I have a problem with Ros discussed below:
rviz running with "roslaunch orrosplanning collada_rviz_display.launch model: = barrettwam.dae" to start simulation of the WAM
all display screen but nothing else and throw rviz the following errors:
rviz: /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/robot_model/urdf/src/collada_model_reader.cpp:683: bool urdf::ColladaModelReader::_ExtractKinematicsModel(domKinematics_modelRef, domNodeRef, domPhysics_modelRef, const std::list<urdf::ColladaModelReader::JointAxisBinding, std::allocator<urdf::ColladaModelReader::JointAxisBinding> >&): La declaraci√≥n `_checkMathML(papplyelt,"apply")' no se cumple.
[rviz-3] process has died [pid 27214, exit code -6].

    if link.GetParentLink() is None:

And that's not all, I have tested with other models collada_robots, only throw an error here is this:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/orrosplanning/collada_joint_publisher.py", line 78, in <module>
    jsp.loop()
  File "/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/orrosplanning/collada_joint_publisher.py", line 53, in loop
    if link.GetParentLink() is None:
AttributeError: 'Link' object has no attribute 'GetParentLink'

Not what happens, I have a few days trying to solve the problem but I can not.
In case you need my pc is a Toshiba Satellite L655D, with AMD and ATI Mobility RADEON HD 4200 and SO: Ubuntu 10.10
I appreciate the time given
Yours sincerely

A:

Instead of using diamondback version, I had to download and compile the trunk version via SVN from http://www.ros.org/wiki/jsk-ros-pkg
Also had to recompile rviz from source, so it links to newly compiled robot_model library.
