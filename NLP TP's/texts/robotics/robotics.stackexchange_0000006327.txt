Q:

beaglebone black power supply for hexapod

I am trying to build a hexapod with camera interfacing using a beaglebone black for college project. I'm not sure what power supply to give so it can power up to bot, having in mind that it should be portable (mobile) and it should power about 18 servo motors along with the camera, wifi and the processor. Your help is needed very badly as i'm nearing the deadline for the project.

A:

18 servos is a lot of power no matter their size but you are going to need to be more specific with what kind of servos you are talking about. That said, this What is the best way to power a large number (27) servos at 5 V? is a good answer to your question.
