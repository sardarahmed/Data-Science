Q:

How to implement offline data synchronization on several nodes?

Hi,
I asked a first question here http://answers.ros.org/question/122901/how-to-implement-offline-data-synchronization/?answer=123036#post-id-123036 but I did not have the right answer of my requirement.
In order to clarify my need, I would like to use the same call graph as in online mode (publish/subscribe mechanism) to do quality test of one algorithm or several. For a better understanding, I draw an example of a ROS nodes architecture (sorry for the link below, my karma is insufficient to publish links):

With this architecture in mind, I want to test the quality of each algorithm for each message. Typically, if the Algorithm 3 is too slow compare to the Algorithm 2, Algorithm2 need to wait the end of the Algorithm 3 process.
Have you already thought about a synchronize solution inside ROS?
Are you going to implement this king of feature, in ROS, in a near future?
Is it impossible to do that in the core?

A:

Ecto is a synchronous processing pipeline that can be tied into ROS. It's aimed primarily at image processing, but I suspect it can be used with other types of data as well.
