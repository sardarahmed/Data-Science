Q:

pip install -u rosdep - No distributions at all found for rosdep

Hi ROS community,
I am running a armhf ubuntu system.  I need to install rosdep an wstool.  The ROS website says use:
sudo pip install -U rosdep
sudo pip install -U wstool

When I try those commands I get:
Downloading/unpacking rosdep
Cannot fetch index base URL http://pypi.python.org/simple/
Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement rosdep
No distributions at all found for rosdep

With rosdep and wstool names changed respectively.
When I go to the website "https://pypi.python.org/pypi"
I get a:
502 Bad Gateway
The server returned an invalid or incomplete response.

Is there a mirror or another way to install the ros python package tools (rosdep, wstool, rospkg, rosinstall, etc) for a non-standard ROS system?
Thank you
