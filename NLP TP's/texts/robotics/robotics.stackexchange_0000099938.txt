Q:

How to launch node from install directory

What I wanted
I want to reduce my docker image size through removing a cloned source code from my workspace in 'src' directory according to this suggestion. For that matter, I have just deployed my source code using the following commands:
    # install package
   sudo catkin config --install
   catkin_make
   catkin_make install

The problem
As a result, three folder have been generated inside 'catking_ws' workspace it self. Namely, build, devel and install. install  directory generate with many other library folders. I then navigated in to /share/ folder and tried to roslaunch  one of my launch file. This is the error that I got:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [oxford_gps_eth/gps_node]: oxford_gps_eth
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/melodic/share

No processes to monitor
shutting down processing monitor...
Expectation
I was able to launch my node, even being in /install/share/ directory without removing the cloned source code in 'src' directory.
I wanted to launch my nodes after building and remove my source code so that I can utilize my image.

Yes, that's exactly the same as you do when you source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash :)
