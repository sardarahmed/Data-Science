Q:

How to disable desktop notifications for colcon?

I am on Ubuntu 20.04 using ROS 2 Foxy. I have installed colcon using:
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

It works fine, but I get desktop notifications when, for example, a build fails. I find the notifications extremely annoying. How can I disable them for colcon? I can't find an option to do that anywhere, and I don't want to disable notifications entirely.

Please see the recommendation from this ticket: https://github.com/colcon/colcon-notification/issues/31#issuecomment-554213559
Since the desktop_notification event handler is provided by a specific extension it is possible to blacklist that specific extension using an environment variable:
COLCON_EXTENSION_BLACKLIST=colcon_core.event_handler.desktop_notification

That's perfect. Thanks.

A quick update to Dirk's excellent answer:
Sometime between his answer and now the environment variable was renamed to COLCON_EXTENSION_BLOCKLIST so the proper incantation now is:
COLCON_EXTENSION_BLOCKLIST=colcon_core.event_handler.desktop_notification
