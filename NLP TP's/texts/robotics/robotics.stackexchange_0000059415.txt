Q:

how to do opencv haartraining with opencv from ROS?

I am new to opencv haartraining and really need some help. I want to train my own haar classifier so I followed some step by step tutorials:
but I am stuck because I can't find the haartraining folder which is needed in --> cp src/mergevec.cpp ~/opencv-2.4.5/apps/haartraining
The problem is I am using opencv installed with ROS hydro (version opencv 2.4.6) and I cannot find where is located the haartraining folder which I need.
I tried using bash comands: sudo find / -iname 'haartraining', sudo find / -iname 'apps', sudo find / -iname 'opencv', sudo find / -iname 'opencv2' but none of these helped me find the haartraining folder.
I am working on Ubuntu 12.04.
Can you suggest how to find the folder haartraining, or how to do the haartraining with opencv from ROS?
Please help me

it would help if you show what compiler error you get (if using C++)  and your package's Manifest.xml and CMakefiles.txt
How did you install OpenCV?

A:

Hi,
I have found 'opencv_haartraining' file into 'opt/ros/hydro/bin/' folder on my computer. I am also using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.
However, please note, there is new version of haar training program. It is 'opencv_traincascade'. This program also is located into 'opt/ros/hydro/bin/' folder.
You can use this program like the following sample:
opencv_traincascade -data haarcascade_file -vec pos_samples.vec -bg negatives.dat -numStages 20 -precalcValBufSize 2000 -precalcIdxBufSize 2000 -featureType LBP -minHitRate 0.999 -maxFalseAlarmRate 0.05 -numPos 3000 -numNeg 3019 -w 24 -h 24 -mode ALL
