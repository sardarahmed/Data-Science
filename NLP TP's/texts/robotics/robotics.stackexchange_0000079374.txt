Q:

kinect rviz displays pointcloud 50 percent under the grid

When I display the pointcloud from my kinect in rviz, one half of the pointcloud is displayed above the grid,and the other half unter it.  I can't find out why. Hope that somebody can help me.

A:

The Kinect data is a cone, whose origin is in the center. The origin of the Kinect data is either in the same frame as the grid or very near it. The grid is just a reference, you can turn it off. It doesn't mean anything for it to be intersecting your Kinect data.

Very true, but I can imagine that @mharms is trying to figure out why the pointcloud isn't 'world-aligned' (ie: oriented in a more 'logical' way).
@mharms: this has to do with TF, and the coordinate frame that the point cloud is being published in. How did you model your robot and your kinect?

Thank you for your comments.I found out, that the display of the pointcloud, was cased because the kinect was standing on a table and the robot was only a few inches high. If I put the kinect on the ground the projection of the pointcloud was like in reality.
