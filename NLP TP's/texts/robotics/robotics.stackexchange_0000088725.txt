A:

Look at the error message on the last line. Somewhere in your catkin workspace, there is a malformed package.xml. The maintainer line should look like this:
<maintainer email="martin.guenther@example.com">Martin Günther</maintainer>

... but the email attribute is missing, i.e. it looks like this, which is wrong:
<maintainer>Martin Günther</maintainer>

Thanks Mr. Martin Gunther for your suggestion. It's working fine now, what I did is I wrote "gmail" instead of "email" in maintainer attribute. once again THANK YOU.
