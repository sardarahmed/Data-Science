Q:

How can I get both tf and tf2 working in ROS

-- +++ processing catkin package: 'tf'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(geometry/tf)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
Could not find a configuration file for package angles.
Set angles_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for
angles.  The file will have one of the following names:
anglesConfig.cmake
angles-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
geometry/tf/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)
-- tf: 1 messages, 1 services
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'tf_conversions'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(geometry/tf_conversions)
-- Eigen found (include: /usr/include/eigen3)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~/catkin_ws$ sudo aptitude install ros-hydro-tf
No candidate version found for ros-hydro-tf
I have a working version on BBB where I see both tf and tf2* in /opt/ros/hydro/share.  I have a non working version with no tf in share.  how do I build or install tf so it either get's to share or is built in a catkin workspace?  I have geometry built in the carkin workspace - and it list tf as being there.

As of hydro tf uses tf2 under the hood. There should be no conflict between them.

A:

The cmake error you posed indicates that you don't have the angles package installed. Have you tried installing it?
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-angles

More generally, if you have a workspace where the dependencies may be missing, you can usually install them with rosdep:
rosdep install --from-paths src -i

Thank you !!
I wish your more general option would be mentioned on more places !
I guess even in 6 years this important info is still missing from many places
