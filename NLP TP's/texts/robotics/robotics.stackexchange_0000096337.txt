Q:

Octomap package not saving the map

Hello,
I'm using octomap package in Kinetic distro in combination with the gmapping package in order to perform 2D SLAM and build a 2D map and also a 3D map with Octomap. Both are working fine, the 3D map is being created correctly in rviz but when I try to save it i get the error of
Request to /octomap_full failes; trying again

In order to save it I'm using the command:
rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver -f name_of_map.bt

or
rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver -f name_of_map.ot

I get the same errors with the two different extensions. Any idea of what could be wrong here?
Thanks.
Andr√©s

Don't know why the error doesn't appear in the question, it is this error: Request to /octomap_full failed; trying again...
