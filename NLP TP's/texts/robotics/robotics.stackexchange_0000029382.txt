Q:

fuel.gazebosim.org down or deprecated?

Hello,
I am trying to run the ROS / Gazebo tutorial.
So I downloaded visualize_lidar.sdf and run as instructed:
ign gazebo -v 4 -r visualize_lidar.sdf
Small issue: there's an error message:
Error [Converter.cc:156] Unable to convert from SDF version 1.10 to 1.9
I "fixed" this by changing the version in the sdf file to 1.9.
Main issue:
This part of the sdf file fails:
<include>
  <pose>0 0 0 0 0 1.57</pose>
  <uri>https://fuel.gazebosim.org/1.0/openrobotics/models/Playground</uri>
</include>

which is obvious as https://fuel.gazebosim.org/ returns 404 page not found.
--> Is this a temporary issue? Or is fuel.gazebosim.org deprecated?
I found the model on https://app.gazebosim.org/ and tried to change the sdf file as follows, but that doesn't work either:
<include>
  <pose>0 0 0 0 0 1.57</pose>
  <uri>https://app.gazebosim.org/OpenRobotics/fuel/models/Playground</uri>
</include>

Fails with following error:
`[Err] [Server.cc:139] Error Code 13: [/sdf/world[@name="visualize_lidar_world"]/include[0]/uri:/home/johan/gazebo_test/src/tutorial/visualize_lidar.sdf:L516]: Msg: Unable to find uri[https://app.gazebosim.org/OpenRobotics/fuel/models/Playground]`

Can you tell us what version of Gazebo you're using? Also, https://fuel.gazebosim.org/ is the correct url. It returns a 404 when using a web browser, but if you go to https://fuel.gazebosim.org/1.0/openrobotics/models/Playground, it'll respond with some data.

Can you tell us what version of Gazebo you're using?

It's Ignition Gazebo Fortress, installed from packages on an Ubuntu 22.04 in a virtualbox on Windows.
Today it does load the model, so I think this must have been a temporary server-side issue (I'm fairly sure I also got the 404 with the full path).
It still doesn't work though (complains about several libraries not found).
In the mean time I have compiled Gazebo Garden and Rolling from source, as well as the ros_gz_bridge (and for the latter also gps_msgs).
This seems to work, except that the bridge errors:
[WARN] [1679564767.107537388] [ros_gz_bridge]: Failed to create a bridge for topic [/model/vehicle_blue/cmd_vel] with ROS2 type [geometry_msgs/msg/Twist] to topic [/model/vehicle_blue/cmd_vel] with Gazebo Transport type [ignition.msgs.Twist]
This seems rather obvious, as there is no topic cmd_vel? Although it's not listed in the official tutorial either?
ign topic -l
/clock
/gazebo/resource_paths
/gui/camera/pose
/model/vehicle_blue/odometry
/model/vehicle_blue/tf
/stats
/world/visualize_lidar_world/clock
/world/visualize_lidar_world/dynamic_pose/info
/world/visualize_lidar_world/pose/info
/world/visualize_lidar_world/scene/deletion
/world/visualize_lidar_world/scene/info
/world/visualize_lidar_world/state
/world/visualize_lidar_world/stats`

EDIT: I learned that:

Contrary to ROS 2, topics that have listeners only are not shown in gz topic -l. This will thankfully be fixed soon.

Obviously  the bridge command failed, as ignition.msgs.Twist has been renamed to gz.msgs.Twist.

It is working now, thank you.
