Q:

Gazebo blank/black screen (not responding)

Hello,
I am a beginner at ROS and I tried today to run the gazebo for a start via ROS. I use ROS Jade.
I ran at the start :
roscore

then in a new terminal I ran :
 roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch 

The gazebo gui popped up and it shows black/blank screen with a Real Time Factor = 0.0 and it's stuck there no matter how much time I let it to load .
The same thing happens when I just run the command :
gazebo

with the exception that then the gui pops a "Does not respond" message .Does this mean that my pc requirements doesn't meet the requirements to run gazebo ?
I am at ubuntu 14.04 LTS (dual installed with Windows) and with the following system overview :
Memory :     3,7 GiB
Processor :  Intel® Core™ i3 CPU 530 @ 2.93GHz × 4 
Graphics :   Gallium 0.4 on AMD CEDAR (DRM 2.43.0, LLVM 3.6.0)
OS type :    64-bit
Disk :       16,2 GB

A:

I will close this question, because after I changed pc to work with ROS and Gazebo I don't have this problem anymore.
Probably the reason why I met this issue with my desktop pc is because of the low capabilities of my graphics card (ATI Radeon HD 5450).
