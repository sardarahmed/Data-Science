@Markus Bader Have a look, http://answers.ros.org/question/12384/change-simulator-stage-model-configurations-in

A:

Are you talking about setting the initial position?
You can set this by modifying your .world file. Example:
roomba( pose [ 3.2 8 0 0 ] name "roomba_0" color "red")
where roomba is the name of the model of my robot. The first argument of pose is the x position, the second is y position, third z position and the last is the orientation of the robot.
Another way to set the robot's position is to click on it and drag to the desired position.

If you want to set the robot's position while the simulator is running, you can click on the robot and drag it to the position that you want.

Hello and thanks for your comments. But I like to set and change the pose of the robot while the simulation is running. I have to run tests and I do not want to place the robot always with the mouse.
Greetings and thanks again
