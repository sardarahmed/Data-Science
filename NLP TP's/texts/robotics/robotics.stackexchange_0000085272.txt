Q:

Unable to install turtlebot

Hello everyone,
I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) and installed ROS Lunar. I also installed gazebo7. Now, I want to install turtlebot and it's impossible. This is what I did:
I followed all the tutorials about the installation, but after running this:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

I get the following error:
RLException: [turtlebot_world.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot_gazebo] nor is [turtlebot_gazebo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Internet doesn't help. I did everything that says there and nothing works. I also did this:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

before running the other command line. And it doesn't work.
What can I do? Maybe my problem is that I have ROS Lunar and I install kinetic packages, but the tutorials are (almost everyone) for indigo.
Thanks

What specifically did you do and what specifically happened? Also, did you source your workspace (i.e., source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash)?

@jayess It doesn't work:

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

Gives the same error as before:

RLException: ...

I installed everything as: http://sauravag.com/2016/10/how-to-setup-turtlebot-simulator-in-ros-with-gazebo/ for example

@jayess Do you know what can I do? I really need this working. Thanks

A:

You do not appear to have the package turtlebot_gazebo installed. There's a comment at the bottom of the blog mentioning what looks like you need to install slightly different packages including ros-indigo-turtlebot-gazebo.
