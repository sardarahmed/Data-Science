Q:

Moveit import scene from text automatically

We can export and import Moveit scene objects to/from a text file (*.scene) using the RViz GUI (picture below). I would like to do the same automatically, so that the scene will be loaded on start. I am aware of the option of creating collision objects by code, however I want to have a more maintainable approach (data over code).
Is there a way to save/load Moveit planning scene objects to/from text, using C++ API or using an existing ros node/service?
System: Ubuntu 16.04, ROS-Kinetic

A:

There is a node under moveit_ros_planning_type pkg, where you can pass argument and publish scene.
Just add this to your launch file:
<arg name="scene_file" default="$(find project_name)/config/file.scene"/> 
<node name = "moveit_publish_scene_from_text" pkg= "moveit_ros_planning" type = "moveit_publish_scene_from_text" args= "$(arg scene_file)"/>
