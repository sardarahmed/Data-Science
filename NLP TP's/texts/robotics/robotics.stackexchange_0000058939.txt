Q:

hector_qrcode_detection

I can't to start work with hector_qrcode_detection. I edited this launch file I only change this sector
<remap from="openni/image"             to="/image_raw" />
<remap from="openni/image_percept"     to="worldmodel/image_percept" />
<remap from="openni/image/qrcode"      to="image/qrcode" />
<remap from="openni/image/camera_info" to="/camera_info" />

Because I use uvc_camera for testing, but I going to use this package with kinect. So when I start this launch file, I didn't see that any topic supsribes to image_raw. Where is problem? What I'm doing wrong?

A:

Normally, camera nodes publish their topics (image_raw, camera_info etc.) to a sub namespace (/camera/image_raw, /camera/camera_info etc.) as opposed directly to the root namespace. Note also that the example launch file uses nodelets, and loads the qr detection nodelets into already pre-existing camera nodelet managers. It would help if you can edit your original question and post the output of the following commands:
rostopic info /image_raw

 rostopic list | grep image

I edited question with outputs. I hope it helps. Honestly I don't know a lot about nodelets, but I'll of course read about it.

Ok, looks like the qr code detection node might not be running. What's the output of "rosnode list"?
Comment by Kirill_Sokolov on 2014-04-26:
I added output rosnode list and output rosnode info /qrcode_detection_kinect. But how we can see the node is runnig, but it doesn't have any subscribers or publisher.
