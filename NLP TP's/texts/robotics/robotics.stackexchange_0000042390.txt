Q:

getting collisions in gazebo plugin

Hi all,
I'm writing a world plug-in and I would like some event to happen when two specific models collide.
My problem is that I don't see the appropriate methods to do this in the gazebosim.org documentation.  I can get the world pose and write my own collision detection, but shouldn't this already be happening?  How do I get access to the collisions of a model (if any)?
Thanks

Well, if you're looking to check for contact between models, the first thing that pops into my head is the gazebo_ros_bumper gazebo plugin. You can find the source code here if you want to look through it. That might provide you with a good starting point.
When I was looking to detect collision, I simply made my robot a gigantic bump sensor. That allowed me to subscribe to the bumper topic and find collisions that way. It's not the most efficient method, but it was a quick fix for me.

Looks like I might have to go this way too, can't seem to find a good way to do what I'd like inside of a plug-in.  Thanks for the suggestion.
