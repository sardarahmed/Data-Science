Q:

Problem building rosjava_core and android_core (couldn't find install_generated_modules.py)

I am trying to build rosjava_core and android_core from source.  Here are the steps I've tried:

hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava rosjava_core
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava.android android_core

From http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/building.html

roscd rosjava_core
./gradlew install

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 mins 13.005 secs

From http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/android_core/html/building.html

roscd android_core
rosrun rosjava_bootstrap install_generated_modules.py android_tutorial_pubsub

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named install_generated_modules.py below /home/brandonb/ros_android3/rosjava_core/rosjava_bootstrap

I looked in the rosjava_core/rosjava_bootstrap directory and there is no scripts directory where the install_generated_modules.py used to be.

A:

The person in charge of rosjava and rosjava.android updated rosjava with some significant internal changes yesterday, however has not updated the android portion.  My guess is that you will need to use the previous version of rosjava until he does...

Thanks.  Do you have a suggestion for what previous version I should try?  I tried change set 954:ff50a6891058 from March 14th but ./gradlew install failed.

android_core and the associated documentation have been updated and build correctly again.

Great!  I have android_core building successfully now.  I also had to "hg clone https://code.google.com/p/rosjava.google rosjava_google" and run "gradlew install" on that because I was getting an error about "compressed_visualization_transport_msgs does not exist" during the android_core build.
