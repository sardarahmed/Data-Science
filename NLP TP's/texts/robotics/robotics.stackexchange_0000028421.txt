A:

"Best" is a bit too general; it all depends on your use case, the system you're working on, which integrations you need, etc.
The latest stable release is Gazebo 9. That is a long-term-support version and will be supported until 2023. You can check here for other versions.
For the functions that "disappeared", you can search the Migration guide for the replacement.
