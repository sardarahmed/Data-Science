A:

This repository from
SebastianGrans has a nice ROS2 PointCloud demo publisher and a subscriber (in Python). It could be the base for your work, I hope.
Some examples of working with transforming a PointCloud are there (ROS1, pointcloud to laserscan-like) and in this package (PCL (Point Cloud Library) ROS interface stack). The last one could be your best choice.
