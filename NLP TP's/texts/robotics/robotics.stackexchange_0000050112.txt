Q:

Depth map from a stereo camera

Hi,
I want to adapt the RGBDSLAM node that works with the kinect to make it work with my stereo camera. From the Bumblebee2 i can access to the rectified images, the disparity map and the pointcloud using the streo_image_proc node. The RGBDSLAM needs a pointcloud, an rgb image and a depth map.
How can i access to the depth map from my stereo camera ? does the the stereo_image_proc node do it ? Because i didn't find any topic that publishes this depth map.
Thank you

A:

You can use use rgbdslam with a stereo camera directly. There are parameters called "wide_...", with which you can set the monochrome image and the cloud. For instance like that:
<param name="config/wide_topic"                    value="/camera/image_mono"/>
<param name="config/wide_cloud_topic"              value="/camera/points"/>
