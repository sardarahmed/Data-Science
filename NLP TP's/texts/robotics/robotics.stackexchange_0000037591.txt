Q:

Problems viewing RGBDSLAM saved PCD files with pcd_viewer

Hi folks
Using RGBDSLAM I have generated a few maps (small and large) and have saved them as PCD files using the GUI. However I have not been able to subsequently view them with pcd_viewer (installed with the ros-electric-perception-pcl-addons package) using the following command (as per http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/RGBD-6D-SLAM):
rosrun pcl_visualization pcd_viewer -ax 0.1 test.pcd
as I get the following error:
> Loading test.pcd /opt/ros/electric/stacks/perception_pcl_addons/pcl_visualization/bin/pcd_viewer: symbol lookup error: /opt/ros/electric/stacks/perception_pcl_addons/pcl_visualization/bin/pcd_viewer: undefined symbol: _ZN17pcl_visualization28PCLVisualizerInteractorStyle3NewEv
I looks like the same issue is being experienced with the laser test group http://answers.ros.org/question/3686/point-cloud-viewer-not-working-why
Is anyone currently able to use pcd_viewer?

i was talking about ROS independent PCL library installed in the system. http://pointclouds.org/downloads/

Rightio, do I need to let any team in particular know about this? Also, where do I get the standalone PCL 1.4 viewer you mentioned - its not an obvious package.

I just checked the pcl_visualization and even i am getting the same error using it in ros. I guess this is a bug.

I have pcl 1.4 standalone so i use pcd_viewer filename.pcd to view the cloud. I just wanted to check if the cloud is fine in your case.

Sure thing, I'll post it shortly - but its odd that others are having the same issue with an undefined symbol - can you suggest a dependency we may be missing?

Could you upload the pcd file somewhere and give the link here for us to check

Have you tried pcl/pcd_viewer instead of pcl_visualization/pcd_viewer? For me it works.

A:

I think this is because libpcl_visualization.so files inside pcl_visualizations_addons/lib/ and pcl/lib/ are conflicting. The loader is looking for the symbol inside pcl/lib/libpcl_visualization.so whereas the symbol is actually located in the other library.
I managed to workaround this problem by replacing all occurences of pcl_visualization with pcl_visualization_addons in the following three files:

perception_pcl_addons/pcl_visualization/src/examples/CMakeLists.txt
perception_pcl_addons/pcl_visualization/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt
perception_pcl_addons/pcl_visualization/CMakeLists.txt
