Q:

How to establish a TCP connection

I need to implement something that could send data from a not-ROS-running System(A) to a ROS-running System(Z) and later sending data from Z back to A using a TCP connection (using socket). I was looking for something on that page http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/TCPROS but it is not clear for me. Are there any tutorials/codes to launch a server on a ROS-running System and listening for clients? Are there any packages that allow to implement TCP communication?

Hello, did you solve your problem? Now i have the same Problem. I really want to know what you have done. And i can not run the code from https://github.com/abhinavjain241/comm_tcp in ROS. I look forward to your answer.

This is already answered. However, I would like to add my words here. The comment above refers to a code that creates and manages a socket all by itself. It would be better to do this low-level task by an external library. For example, ZeroMQ is a robust and famous library with bindings in many languages. Please feel free to check out ros_zeromq_tutorial.

A:

ROSTCP is an adapter that lets ROS send messages over TCP for topics; not for general use.
If you want a TCP socket, use the standard OS interface for creating a TCP socket.
There are many good tutorials about this online; here are a few:

Thank you for your answer, I'll on that. I found some helpful code. But client_node cannot connect to the server.  https://github.com/abhinavjain241/comm_tcp

I'm not familiar with that project, and I can't help you with it. I'd recommend that you ask a new question or open an issue on that repository. For either, I recommend that you include the specifics of your issue such as the exact commands and exact output.
