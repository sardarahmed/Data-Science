Q:

Gearbox Joint operation

Hello everyone,
I am trying to use the gearbox joint. I found a world example but it seems to be outdated, as the parameters have been renamed, from gear_ratio and reference_body to gearbox_ratio and gearbox_reference_body respectively. However I cannot get it to work, and I do not know if it is my setup's fault, as I am not sure I have understood the way it works correctly, or if it just not supported anymore.
In the case that it is not, does someone have an idea how to transmit motion and torque from a joint to another ?
Thank you all for your time.

A:

There's a model with a gearbox joint here https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models/blob/master/demo_joint_types/model.sdf
The gearbox joint is more of a constraint between two joints rather than a true joint. Create two revolute joints: one for the input link and one for the output link. On the gearbox joint <parent> specifies the input link, and <child> specifies the output link. <gearbox_ratio> is the ratio of the input and output. <gearbox_reference_body> is another link that is fixed relative to the input and output. The physics engine measures the velocity of the input and output link relative to this link when enforcing the gear ratio.
