A:

I run gazebo 1 and 1.4 on a Core2Duo which is much slower than your processor. It works reasonably well. What kind of simulation are you running? And is your video card being used or the one on the processor?

well i need to work with shadow hand, but in fact when i just spawn gazebo empty_world, it's extremley slowly just to turn around the world. wis using the video card.

Check the drivers from your video card and make sure the external card is used, not the one on the processor. empty_world only should be running smooth.
