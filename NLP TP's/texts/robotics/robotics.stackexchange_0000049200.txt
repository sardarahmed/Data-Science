Q:

Problems with the Turtlebot Dashboard Launch

When I type in rqt -s turtlebot_dashboard to terminal I get the error
WARNING: Package name "swig-wx" does not follow the naming conventions. It should start with a lower case letter and only contain lower case letters, digits and underscores.
WARNING: Package name "swig-wx" does not follow the naming conventions. It should start with a lower case letter and only contain lower case letters, digits and underscores.
RosPyPluginProvider.discover() could not find ROS master, all rospy-based plugins are disabled
qt_gui_main() found no plugin matching "turtlebot_dashboard"
What do I do to launch the Dashboard?

You could overlook this warning. I get this warning every time and it's not a problem.

A:

I believe Groovy by default assumes a TurtleBot is using a Kabuki base with related drivers and sensors.  When using a TurtleBot with the Create base, you'll see errors similar to that in the original post.
For me the key to getting a dashboard up with the Create base is to set the following environment variables on both the robot laptop and the remote workstation:
export TURTLEBOT_BASE=create
export TURTLEBOT_STACKS=circles
export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=kinect

I can then get a working dashboard by running the following on the robot laptop:
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

And the following command on my workstation laptop:
roslaunch turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard.launch
