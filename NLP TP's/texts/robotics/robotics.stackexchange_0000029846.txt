Q:

Decomposing objects into their structural components in pcl

Hey guys,
Do you know any pcl example or source code that does decompose objects into their components by using any kind of a method?
I know that there are SAC based segmentation methods that does primitive shape fitting but I don't think they are able to extract mug handles or other similar sub-components. Well you can get the handle after extracting the cylinder-like mug component, but I need sth that is able cluster other smaller parts also.
I need this just for visualization purposes, it is not required to run online/real time, it is adequate to be able to work on stationary scenes/inputs.
Thanks

A:

I am not an expert in 3D segmentation, so if somebody is then please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the problem of segmenting an object point cloud into different parts is still an open research question. I don't think there is anything built in to PCL which can perform this.
Some people are working on this problem (using radial reflection or bounding volume hierarchies for example), but I don't see any released code.
