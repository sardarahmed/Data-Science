Q:

real-time motion planning in moveit

My question is about real-time motion planning in moveit or other ros packages. currently there are a good number of offline planners in moveit but is there any online and real-time planning method?

I'm searching for a similar package too. I want to implement a real-time obstacles avoidance planning using ROS. Have you found any suitable solutions?

A:

I am pretty sure the short answer is "No", it is not made for high-speed servoing etc, but you could use its parts to make something that might suit your needs. The harder your real-time requirements and the more you need trajectories updated on-the-fly, the less likely it is that you will have an easy time.

thanks,I have also been using it more for offline planning giving the optimization enough time to find good plans. Are there other packages that can do real-time planning under constraint?

I don't know of any. If offline planning is fine, implementing a method in MoveIt might be the most convenient option.
