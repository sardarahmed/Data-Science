Q:

PCL and ROS Indigo: No such file or directory

I'm trying to compile a package that uses ROS Indigo and PCL trunk. This is the error:
/home/andreas/baxter_ws/src/object_grasping/src/lccp_clustering.cpp:58:48: fatal error: pcl/segmentation/lccp_segmentation.h: No such file or directory
#include <pcl/segmentation/lccp_segmentation.h>

The header lccp_segmentation.h is in: /usr/local/include/pcl-1.8/pcl/segmentation/
The CMakeLists.txt has this: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Migration#PCL and the package.xml has this: https://github.com/ros-perception/pcl_conversions/commit/a868e1a16e442c135f66a9738619d290bc4ee896
Why does the package not find the header?

I solved this by adding find_package(PCL 1.8 REQUIRED) and link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS}) to CMakeLists.txt

A:

It's probably not getting the correct include path, since pcl-1.8 is in the path of the header you need. You'll need to ensure that the package you're building is finding pcl 1.8 rather than 1.7 or some other version and then ensure that it's passing the correct include paths to the building of your library/executable. It might be useful to run with VERBOSE=1 to see what arguments are being passed to c++.
