Dear friends,
I am new in ROS, I am usinig CMVISION package, and the tos topic which I need is " /blobs ", with type "cmvision/blobs"
$ rosmsg show cmvision/Blob
uint32 red
uint32 green
uint32 blue
uint32 area
uint32 x
uint32 y
uint32 left
uint32 right
uint32 top
uint32 bottom
I want to just read the "x", and "y" from this message,
As far as I know the "/" can help me, but I tried "rostopic echo /blobs/x" and it did not work....
Any body knows how I could do this?

Do you want to read the value in terminal or use it in your code?

May you please say your solution for use in terminal , also?

A:

The message that is being send over the topic is of type Blob.
You need to receive the message type Blob by subscribing to the topic.
Then in your code you can write something like
int x = blob_message.x;
int y = blob_message.y;

So in summary you need to receive the complete message.
