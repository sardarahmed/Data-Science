Q:

How to serialize C++ objects containing ROS messages

Hello I have the following class I'd like to serialize:
class Foo
{  int x;
   std::vector<double> bars;
   moveit_msgs::RobotState _startState;
}

in the absence of any ROS/MoveIt components, I am able to serialize out/in using the Boost serialization library. I resume that if all I had was the moveit message type then I could use the move_it serialization described on  MessagesSerializationAndAdaptingTypes (assuming moveit_msgs are serializable by ROS?). But when I have a class containing both then I am not sure what to do. How do I go about serializing it now? I am using ROS Groovy
thanks

A:

In ROS you cannot serialize and send arbitrary datatypes, you need to use ROS message datatypes. Some libraries provide custom mappings from native datatypes to ROS message-serialized formats. But you need a target ROS message format.
More on messages here: http://wiki.ros.org/Messages
