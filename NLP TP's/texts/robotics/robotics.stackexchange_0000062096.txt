Q:

problem with move_base

I am trying to control a bot with a lidar. When i run the launch files to switch on the lidar and obtain the cmd_vel values from rosserial based on odometry data, the cmd_vel is being published by the move_base.launch file. But, when i run the navigation stack which uses this data, I get an error that says-" THe bot cannot move forward". A little debugging tells me that the navigation stack subscribes to cmd_vel from move_base. But, the cmd_vel is not being output by the launch files itself. How to solve this problem?q

A:

Topics such as cmd_vel are not published/subscribed to by launch files, they are (or should be) published/subscribed to by nodes. Try looking at your nodes and see what they publish (and what they don't).
