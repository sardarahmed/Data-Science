Q:

Xacro problems in Indigo

Hi,
I recently installed Indigo on a fresh 14.04 install after working in Hydro for a while, and xacro code that used to work no longer works. When I simply try to run xacro.py I get errors complaining about kobuki_description, which the internet doesn't seem to know much about. Any help?
’$:’rosrun xacro xacro.py neato.urdf.xacro > model.urdf

A:

The  problem is that kobuki_description apparently is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH of your indigo-workspace. You'd get the exact same error if this was the case in hydro, so this isn't really indigo-specific.
Running
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-kobuki

should fix the problem. Also see this related Q/A: http://answers.ros.org/question/190137/problem-of-installing-kobuki-in-turtlebot-installation-indigo/

That worked, thanks! It must not be installed as part of ros-indigo-desktop-full. Now I need to try and install the turtlebot stuff from source, because debs aren't available yet.
