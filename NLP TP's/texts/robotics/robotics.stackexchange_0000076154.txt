Q:

how can i solve the forward kinematics and get the cartesian positions for the links on a arm?

hi !
i have to control arm robot using ROS and  solve the forward kinematics and inverse kinematics .
how can i  solve the forward kinematics and get the cartesian positions for the links on a arm using ROS Jade ?
how can i connect arm robot to my ROS program and read positions  from the links on a arm using sensors ?
what is the best solution for  forward kinematics and inverse kinematics in ROS ?
please help me

A:

The easiest option is to create a URDF model for your robot and publish joint_state data to a robot_state_publisher (tutorial). This will generate tf transform data for all frames, which is the same as forward kinematics. This is really meant for representing the current robot state however.
A very convenient option is generating a MoveIt! config for the robot. The kinematics capabilities can then be used programmatically as described in the kinematics tutorial.
There are also other options like using KDL, but I believe MoveIt! is probably the easiest to use.
