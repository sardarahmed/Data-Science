Q:

rospy master status

Is there a tool for checking if the rosmaster is up using rospy?
Something along the lines of
roscpp's ros::master::check()?

A:

Might not be the best answer but the sample code in Master_API page might work for your purpose. If no master is running, the follwoing line would fail with socket.error:
code, msg, val = m.getSystemState(caller_id)
