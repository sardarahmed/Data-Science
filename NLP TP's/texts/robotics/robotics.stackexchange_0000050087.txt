Q:

AMCL fails to load map

Hello,
I am trying to navigate around a map that I built using the husky navigation gmapping demo. I have built the map and saved it in my home folder. When I try to run the amcl demo it fails though. I get the code:
core service [/rosout] found
process[map_server-1]: started with pid [18464]
[ERROR] [1365180853.546403072]: Map_server could not open ~/map1.yaml.
process[amcl-2]: started with pid [18475]
process[move_base-3]: started with pid [18572]
[map_server-1] process has died [pid 18464, exit code 255, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation/map_server/bin/map_server ~/map1.yaml __name:=map_server __log:=/home/lemur2/.ros/log/cbfe7674-9e0e-11e2-ac94-0090f5c994bc/map_server-1.log].
log file: /home/lemur2/.ros/log/cbfe7674-9e0e-11e2-ac94-0090f5c994bc/map_server-1*.log

When I look for the log file there is nothing there. Any ideas about what is going on?

Does the file ~/map1.yaml exist?

Indeed it does.

A:

Not really a full answer, but I found out that I can have amcl use the /map topic rather than a saved map. I tried that and it no longer gave me the error. amcl is still not working, but that is for another thread.

Can you please explain how exactly you use the map topic with amcl?

You need to load a map using the map_server node, and then set the use_map_topic argument in amcl to true.
