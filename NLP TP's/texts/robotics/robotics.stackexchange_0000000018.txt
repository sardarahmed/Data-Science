Q:

What are good methods for tuning the process noise on Kalman filters?

Most often tuning the Kalman filter noise matrices is done by trial and error or domain knowledge. Are there more principled ways for tuning all the Kalman filter parameters?

A:

You can get experimental data, and perform some statistical analysis to determine the process noise (noise between time steps), and sensor noise (compared to a ground truth).
To get the ground truth for sensor noise, you either need a more accurate sensor, or else experimentally test while keeping the state of interest at a known (usually fixed) value.
If you do not have experimental data, you can use the datasheets or specifications for each sensor to determine its noise. The process noise would be more difficult in this instance, but you may be able to guess at its value by assuming a certain amount of noise due to, for example, an actuator, if the actuator is the primary source of process noise.

Another way is to consider the maximum settling time allowed for estimation. This will determine the ratio between the process noise and sensor noise. This allows you to have the maximum filtering effect while meeting your settling time requirements.
Note that this does not provide a good way to tune the ratio between different sensors, or between different states, so is not perfect.

Basically, if you have experimental data, you can obtain optimal performance. Otherwise, you can only calculate process noise based by assuming the likely noise of the dominant contributor to process noise, or by determining what minimum performance is required (which is not optimal, but at least gets what is needed).
