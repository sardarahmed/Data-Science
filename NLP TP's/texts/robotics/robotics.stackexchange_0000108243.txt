Q:

rospy.init_node() stuck in loop

I had a problem with initializing a ROS node in python in a larger project. The following minimum reproducible example has the same issue:
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Init node")
    rospy.init_node('testNode', anonymous=True)
    print("Node initialized")

Only the "Init node" is printed, and the script freezes in the rospy.init_node() call.
roscore is already running, confirmed by rostopic list returning the /rosout topic.
I have tried reinstalling ros and all python packages, as well as rebuilding the ros project.
When debugging using pdb, the program is stuck in the following loop:
while hasattr(f, "f_code"):

    co = f.f_code
    filename = os.path.normcase(co.co_filename)
    if filename == file_name and f.f_lineno == lineno and co.co_name == func_name:
    if f.f_back:
    f = f.f_back

in the following path: */opt/ros/noetic/lib/python3/dist-packages/rosgraph/roslogging.py(64)findCaller()
*
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
EDIT:
It is also not possible to ctrl + c to stop the process, and I have to close the terminal for it to stop.
If I comment out the call to logger.info("init_node, name[%s], pid[%s]", resolved_node_name, os.getpid()) which leads to the infinite loop as shown above, the program instead gets stuck in the following loop:
while not node.uri and not is_shutdown():
    time.sleep(0.00001) #poll for XMLRPC init

in /opt/ros/noetic/lib/python3/dist-packages/rospy/impl/init.py(105)start_node()

A:

Fixed by running
sudo apt-get remove ros-* 

then reinstalling using http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu, and creating a new conda environment. Not sure what actually caused the issue.
