Q:

Modifying roscpp scripts (msg_gen.py)

I would like to make local modifications to msg_gen.py for my packages. I've successfully modified C++ libraries in roscpp by using a copy of roscpp in my workspace, and these changes are picked up by other C++ packages/nodes which depend on the roscpp library.
However, when I modify roscpp/rosbuild/scripts/msg_gen.py, the changes don't actually take effect â€” it seems like the generate_messages() cmake function in my other packages somehow knows to use the system version (/opt/ros/indigo/share/roscpp/rosbuild/scripts/msg_gen.py).
What do I need to do so that generate_messages() can use the local, modified version of the message generator?

A:

You need to modify the code in the gencpp / genpy packages instead.
The code in roscpp/rosbuild is only used when you use rosbuild but since you are using catkin you need to modify the code in the above packages instead.

Thanks, that worked! I had to pull message_generation into my tree as well, to make it use my version of gencpp.
