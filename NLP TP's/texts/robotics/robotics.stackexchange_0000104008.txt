Q:

Formatting rosservice response

I'm working on ROS MELODIC.
I would like to return as a service response a string containing a list of areas with some data.
The problem here is that I wanted to format the output so on the client side, the message could be seen clear such as:
Area {i}: Data <...> 

Area {i}: Data <...>

I have tried either with normal string or array (string[])
So my problem here is that I can't print \n or something like that in order to see each element as a new line in the output on the client. I don't know if the problem is that this cannot be achieved through this (since the message response is printed as a list), or that I'm missing something.
Also, feel free to correct me if I didn't write my post correctly, I do want to check all the recommendations but I wanted to post this so I can get an answer as soon as possible.

A:

In general, it is preferred to create a new Message type, in your case something like Area.msg, and in your Service return a list of Areas.
Then, in your client, you can print it out as you wish.
You should be able though to send and print strings with new lines; remember, if your Service type looks like this:
---
string areas

then you need to print the areas variable:
print(response.areas)
