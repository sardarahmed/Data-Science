Q:

ROS Package to filter raw IMU data (Linear Acceleration/Angular Velocity/Magnetic Orientation)

I'm going through the ROS packages for a generic package that will take raw IMU 9DOF readings and perhaps use a Kalman filter to fuse data from the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Magnometer. So far I've only found the imu_filter_madgwick package. However, it has been difficult to install with catkin. As a newbie to the ROS system I found this surprising.
Is there a generic solution for IMU filtering in ROS?
Thank you in advance. I would appreciate any guidance in this matter.

A:

Are you using the hydro branch? It works fine with catkin.

You're absolutely right. I forgot to switch branches. Thank you! To continue the discussion, however, is this the only raw data IMU solution?

robot_localization uses the IMU data in an EKF.

Follow up: While I got most of the package dependencies to build, it trips up on the boost library from tf with errors. I made a separate question found here: http://answers.ros.org/question/194856/error-with-boost-while-building-tf-package-in-catkin-ws/
