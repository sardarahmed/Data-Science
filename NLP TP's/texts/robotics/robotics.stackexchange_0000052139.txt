Q:

gmapping-get-empty-map-coordinates

Dear all,
I wonder whether is possible to get the coordinates of empty space of the global map. The thing is that, I would like to move the robot to a random goal that is within the empty space of the map, so the navigation stack can plan the path and use actionlib to move the robot.
In advance thank you :)

Please separate your tags using space, not minus. Thanks ;)

A:

You can subscribe to a map topic from your node and find randomly indices of some free space. Then you can convert these indices to Cartesian  coordinates (using map metadata).
