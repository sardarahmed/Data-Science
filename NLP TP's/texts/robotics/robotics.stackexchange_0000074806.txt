Q:

Sacn Topic interpretation

Hi,
Can I know how to interpret lidar data obtained on scan topic. I am using Hokuyo UST-10LX. Are the published values in cms or m ? I could not get this from the datasheet.
Thanks in advance.

A:

The  sensor_msgs/LaserScan message has the range in metres. What the sensor puts out doesn't matter, it is the ROS API that counts.
