Q:

rocon: 'already connected to this hub'

Hi,
I am following through the roscon installation tutorial for ROS Hydro, but I am getting stuck at the verification step.
The instructions say to execute:
> . /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
> rocon_launch chatter_concert chatter.concert

When I do this the terminal windows spawn as expected. However they all have a warning:
[WARN] [WallTime: 1409023936.036277] Gateway : not registering on the hub [already connected to this hub]
[WARN] [WallTime: 1409023936.544642] Gateway : not registering on the hub [already connected to this hub]

Is this warning a problem or not? The hub seems to be running as though it's a daemon, as closing the terminal down and starting this command again does not make the warning go away.
I would post a screen shot but I don't have enough points (need at least 20) to do so.
Kind Regards
Bart

I don't know about this message in particular, but warnings generally imply that a given operation worked, although something was noticed in passing.

A:

Ok, digging back through my memory, I believe this is because it was starting a gateway with default settings to look for a hub on localhost, and also via zeroconf. If the localhost hub was found (which it did for chatter_concert), then zeroconf discovery would throw this warning when it would discover the same hub.
This has been updated on the hydro-devel/indigo branches so that it doesn't do this double lookup.
In short, don't worry about it :)

I haven't verified this but it sounds reasonable.
