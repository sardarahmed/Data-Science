Q:

Is rosversion broken on Groovy?

Recently, I've noticed problems with rosversion on Groovy:
$ rosversion roslaunch
Cannot locate [roslaunch]

It works with the -d flag, and it works on Hydro. I suspect my problem started around the time of the new rosdistro release.
Unfortunately, roscore runs that exact command, and exits when it fails.
Am I the only one seeing this?
UPDATE: I seem to have python-rospkg 1.0.20-1, probably from shadow-fixed. That must be the problem.

rospkg is always deployed with the same version in all three repos - building, shadow-fixed and ros.

Piyush and I figured it out this afternoon. You're going to love this!
We had released a 3rd-party libfreenect package to Groovy. As suggested by the bloom tutorial, we added a package.xml, with this install command:
install(FILES package.xml DESTINATION share/${PROJECT})

Apparently, ${PROJECT} was not defined in that CMake file, so the file got installed directly in /opt/ros/groovy/share, instead of the desired /opt/ros/groovy/share/libfreenect. That had the unexpected effect of hiding all the wet Groovy packages, since package.xml is never resolved in a package subdirectory.
Fortunately, this only affected the two of us, because we had installed ros-groovy-libfreenect from the ros-shadow-fixed repository. We will release a fix shortly.
