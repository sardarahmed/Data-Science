Q:

Open low tcp port from ROS node

I'm currently writing a node that uses a 3rd party library. This library listens for multi-cast data streaming on port 1001. The problem I'm running into is that it requires root privileges to bind to this port (or any port <= 1023).
There isn't anything I can do to change the port number that I'm aware of, and (a) I don't want to have to run the node as root, especially since this node is likely gong to be distributed, and (b) as far as I can tell running the node as root isn't possible even if I wanted too.
Does anybody know what I might be able to do to listen to port 1001 from within my node?

A:

Port under 1024 cannot be open by non-root user on Linux by design.
You can play with the uid/gid permissions to allow the node to run with root capabilities while being able to be launched by anyone but this does not solve the safety issue.
I don't know your library but it is unlikely that it binds a low port number without allowing you to change the port number. And if it really is the case, I guess you should send a bug report to them.

The library I'm using is an SDK that has the port number hard-coded (it streams data from software on a remote computer that also has the port hard-coded). I'll work with the SKD developers on finding a more permanent solution, but I was at least able to test my node using the setuid flag. Thanks!

Great to hear this! Be extra careful with setuid as the process will run as root. Good luck.
