hey, please indicate whether your questions is answered or not in order to clean up the list of unanswered questions.

A:

the obstacle.cpp file along with its header defines the obstacle interface and particular implementations (point, line, polygon obstacles) for consideration in the teb_local_planner optimization problem.
Although the obstacle class contains member fields for velocities, the teb_local_planner does not support actual dynamic obstacles yet. I am going to edit this answer as soon as it is supported.
EDIT: dynamic obstacles are now supported. Please check the tutorials ;-)
