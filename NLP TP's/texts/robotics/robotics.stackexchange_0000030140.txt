Q:

How to upgrade diamondback RC to Release? (gentoo)

I installed on Gentoo like so:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Gentoo
How would I best upgrade things? Do I just need to run the rosinstall line again? Is there some command to rebuild everything that I should run afterwards?

A:

Running the rosinstall again should work.
It's easiest to use the update option of rosinstall, like this:
$ rosinstall ~/ros

(Assuming you had installed it to ~/ros initially.)
You probably do not need to rebuild everything, just the parts you actually depend on. To do that, run rosmake on your packages or stacks in the normal way.

Note we are transitioning to using versioned rosinstall targets.  You can run rosinstall ~/ros http://URL_OF_ORIGINAL_ROSINSTALL to get the new version.  Where URL_OF_ORIGINAL_ROSINSTALL comes from the part of the wiki page you followed previously.
