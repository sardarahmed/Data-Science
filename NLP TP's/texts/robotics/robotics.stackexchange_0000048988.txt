Q:

is there any ROS package for exploration in Groovy (ubuntu 12.10)?

Hi,
I have been searching for a ROS package for exploration in ubuntu 12.10 and I have not found one yet - see my related question
So, does anyone know about one which is compatible with ROS-groovy ? Thank you

Already posted this answer here, but it fits your question very well, so here goes:
You can try out the hector_exploration_planner package that we use with great success for exploration while participating in the RoboCup Rescue Robot League. There currently isn't an example available interacting with the navigation stack, but implementing a node that calls the service provided by the hector_exploration_node and feeds the provided goals to move_base should be straightforward.
Real world example (RoboCup Rescue 2012 final, note that the background checkerboard is on a 1m grid)
Two examples of exploration in (gazebo) simulation:

I had already seen it but I thought that it was not ported to groovy because you can find many ros-groovy-hector packpages via apt-get but not the navigation - I had to install it via source code. Will try it, thank you!

We haven't done extensive documentation of the package yet and it might still change a little bit. For those reasons it's not yet available as a .deb package. But generally, exploration works well so far for us.

Is there any online reference available?

Looks interesting. Do you plan to catkinize hector navigation in the near future? And is the maze world file publicly available?
Comment by jorge on 2013-10-18:
I have forked the repo and catkinized a couple of packages to make easier for us to give it a try. Tell me if you want me to catkinize the rest when I have a bit extra time.

@jorge, any chance you could share the link to the catkinized repo you mentioned? I've been trying to catkinize the hector_exploration planner myself.
