Q:

Is rosdoc supposed to be working in groovy with catkin pakages?

Is rosdoc supposed to be working in groovy with catkin pakages? I tried to use it but got meesages like:
WARN: Package 'lrs_msgs' does not have a valid manifest.xml file, manifest information will not be included in docs

But catkin packages does not have a manifest.xml file.
Or should I generate the documentation in some other way?

A:

Rosdoc has been replaced by rosdoc_lite, which is automatically run for packages in repositories that have rosinstall files listed in the rosdisto repository.

I want to generate private documentation. I cannot find rosdoc_lite in my groovy installation. So how am I supposed to install it?

Please ask that as a separate question, so others can find it in the future.
