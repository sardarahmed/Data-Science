Q:

Ubuntu 13.10 and ROS from source

Hi Guys,
I am trying to install ROS Hydro from source on my fresh install of 13.10.  The reason being is I have be a shiny new laptop with a Haswell chip that REALLY doesn't play nice with previous versions of gcc before 4.8.
Anyways, I was going through the source install tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source
and it mentions that you need to grab the source list for this distribution:

If you have trouble installing the packages in the command above, make sure you have added the packages.ros.org debian repository to your apt source lists as described starting here: hydro/Installation/Ubuntu#hydro.2BAC8-Installation.2BAC8-Sources.Setup_your_sources.list

The problem is that there is no source list for saucy on the page mentioned.  I know that there are no debian packages for saucy, but where are the source lists so I can install things like python-rosdep etc.  Do I need to compile those from source too?
I know that people have managed to get this working, just not sure how.
Thanks for the help!
Cheers,
Kel

A:

You can use the raring line as a template and substitute raring with saucy. The repository will not contain any ROS packages but all Python tools necessary to build ROS from source (like python-rosdep).

Thanks!  And I just ignore the warning about the packages not being authenticated?

Yes, that is the case for all ROS repos currently.
