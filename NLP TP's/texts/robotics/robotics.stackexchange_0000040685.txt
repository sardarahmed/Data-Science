Q:

how stream theora topic

Hi all,
I performing a teleoperating experiment via webcam vision and using the wireless channel to transport the date, so i am interested on using the theora data compression.
Using usb_cam_node, rostopic list command  shows me the topic /usb_cam/image_raw/ and /usb_cam/image_raw/theora etc.
Using the the command:
rosrun image_view image_view image:/usb_cam/image_raw/, video is streaming but I am not able to undestand how view  the theora topic: /usb_cam/image_raw/theora .
Anyone could help me?
