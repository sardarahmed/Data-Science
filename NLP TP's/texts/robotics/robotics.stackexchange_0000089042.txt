Q:

how to rotate before translate

hi, i am new to ros, tf
new i need to build a transformation, the parameter for the rotation and translation has already been known, but i wonder how to rotate the frame before translate it, will sendTransform() consider the order?
Thank you very much!

A:

You'll need two transforms instead of one, the first with the rotation and then a child one with the translation, and sendTransform them both.
Instead of parent -> child frame you'll have parent -> intermediate rotated child -> child frame, but any tf lookup can ignore the intermediate frame by looking up from parent to child and they'll see the combined proper rotation-then-translation transform.
Or you could do some matrix math to transform the translation in the rotated frame into the parent frame.
