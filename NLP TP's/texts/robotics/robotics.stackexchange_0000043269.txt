Q:

Error: Failed to open port. Permission denied

Hi all,
I have been installing Hokuyo UTM-30LX drivers on ROS following
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-laser-drivers
roslaunch hokuyo_node hokuyo_test.launch
as suggested by http://answers.ros.org/question/35022/hokuyo-laser-installation-ubuntu/,
But I came across with the problem Error: Failed to open port. Permission denied.So I found that there is a solution in hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting 1.2 (http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Troubleshooting)
But there is no specific and clear solution for this problem.
I don't know how to do it next!!!
Any help is appreciated! Thank you!

In the block that start with SUBSYSTEMS, put that in a file called 99-hokuyo.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ There should be similar .rules files there for comparison.

That's actually already an answer, you should post it as such.

Try chmod first, if that works setup udev as @dougbot01 said.

From @dougbot01 and @dornhege:
Try using chmod and then in the block that start with SUBSYSTEMS, put that in a file called 99-hokuyo.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ There should be similar .rules files there for comparison.
