Q:

OGRE EXCEPTION(3:RenderingAPIException): Zero sized texture surface on texture high_def_sensor_RttTex face 0 mipmap 0

Hi,
I tried running the command roslaunch pr2_empty_world.launch, and after starting a bunch of processes and gazebo successfully initializing, the gazebo window suddenly closes and I get this error message:
Gazebo successfully initialized
[ INFO] [1302067229.673734465, 0.001000000]: INFO: gazebo_ros_laser plugin artifically sets minimum intensity to 101.000000 due to cutoff in hokuyo filters.

Thanks for your help!

A:

You said that empty_world works. Could you try running other worlds without the PR2? Also try loading the PR2 without the highdef (prosilica) sensor. You can do this by commenting out the appropriate code in the urdf. Go to "pr2_description", and look around for prosilica.

Things like coffee_cup and simple_box.launch,etc. aren't getting past the "waiting for service spawn_gazebo_model" line. But this problem seems to be different from my original problem. BTW taking out the prosilica lines worked for the pr2_empty_world.launch (though its quite laggy). Why is this?
