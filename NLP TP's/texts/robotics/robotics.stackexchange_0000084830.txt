Q:

tf tutorial is displaying just one turtle instead of two

I am learning tf and doing the tf tutorials (py), In this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf%20listener%20%28Python%29
when I perform the command:
$ roslaunch learning_tf start_demo.launch
I am supposed to see two turtles, but I see only one. I've double checked the instructions and it seems all is correct. What I don't see is where the second turtle's starting position is indicated. Could it be that the second turtle is on top of the first one which is why I don't see it?

A:

Hello @pitosalas,
My guess is that you forgot to add the listener node tag to the launch file.
After the instruction:

2. Running the listener
With your text editor, open the launch file
called start_demo.launch, and add the
following lines:

It must to be like that:
<launch>
    <!-- Turtlesim Node-->
    <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="sim"/>
    <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtle_teleop_key" name="teleop" output="screen"/>

    <node name="turtle1_tf_broadcaster" pkg="learning_tf" type="turtle_tf_broadcaster.py" respawn="false" output="screen" >
      <param name="turtle" type="string" value="turtle1" />
    </node>
    <node name="turtle2_tf_broadcaster" pkg="learning_tf" type="turtle_tf_broadcaster.py" respawn="false" output="screen" >
      <param name="turtle" type="string" value="turtle2" /> 
    </node>
    <node pkg="learning_tf" type="turtle_tf_listener.py" name="listener" />
  </launch>

The turtle_tf_listener is the node that spawns the second turtle (lines 16 and 17)
  16     spawner = rospy.ServiceProxy('spawn', turtlesim.srv.Spawn)
  17     spawner(4, 2, 0, 'turtle2')

Hope it can help you!
Cheers
