Q:

Joints of a model are not visible in the joint panel

I've inserted two models into Gazebo using the GUI. One is the steering cart that is already included with Gazebo, the other is a Velodyne sensor which I created following the tutorials. The Velodyne model has a single revolute joint connecting the base to the top. When I load the Velodyne, I can apply a force to the join to get it to spin however, when I fix it to the cart and save it as a single model, I can no longer see the revolute joint for the Velodyne listed. I can however see the fixed joint I created and also all the joints for the carts wheels.
Is there a proper way to create a new model out of several pre-existing models?

Do you have an example model file to reproduce the problem?

A:

Apparently, the best way to join to models to create a new one is to create a new model file and include the two previous models. See link below for details.
