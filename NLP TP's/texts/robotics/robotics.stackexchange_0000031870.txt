Q:

Is it possible to query if a particular namespace exists?

I'm attempting to detect 3rd party configuration un-intrusively by checking which namespaces exist.
I suppose I can just check for a specific parameter in said namespace, but that feels a little wrong/less robust than checking for the namespace directly.

A:

Parameters, topics, services, and nodes can all create namespaces.  The only way to robustly check for a namespace is to

Query for the parameter
Parse the result from rosgraph.masterapi.Master.getSystemState()

It would be better, though, I think, for your 3rdparty configuration to more explicitly declare its presence (e.g. via parameter, or topic, or otherwise).
