Q:

ROS Kinetic - catkin_make install fails

I am new to ROS Kinetic. To learn more, I have been going through the tutorials provided by the ROS website (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)  and have been doing fine up until creating  a ROS msg and srv. At the final step where one needs to remake the catkin_ws package with  the command catkin_make install, I am given the following output on the terminal:
allen@allen-VirtualBox:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make install

CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:54 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot copy file
  "/home/allen/catkin_ws/src/catkin_generated/installspace/_setup_util.py" to

I don't understand why the  ...installspace/_setup_util.py file can't be copied. I didn't do anything with the file. I have looked at the cmake_install.cmake lines of code that result in the error and see nothing wrong:
54  file(INSTALL DESTINATION "/usr/local" TYPE PROGRAM FILES                                      
      "/home/allen/catkin_ws/src/catkin_generated/installspace/_setup_util.py")
55   endif()
56
57   if(NOT CMAKE_INSTALL_COMPONENT OR "${CMAKE_INSTALL_COMPONENT}" STREQUAL "Unspecified")
58        list(APPEND CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
59        "/usr/local/env.sh")
60        if(CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION)
61             message(WARNING "ABSOLUTE path INSTALL DESTINATION : ${CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES}")
62        endif()

I have been dealing with this issue for over a week and have not found any solutions throughout the internet. I am running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a Windows 10 laptop using Oracle VM Virtualbox.If somebody can help solve this issue, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

A:

The file cannot be copied because your install space is /usr/local only users with roo permissions can copy in that directory.
The problem here is that catkin_make is trying to install your package to /usr/local instead of
Install space: /home/allen/catkin_ws/install.
Can you try the following commands in a new terminal and comment here with the outcome?:

Open a new terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
cd /home/allen/catkin_ws
rm -rf build devel install
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
catkin_make install

I don't know why, but I was unable to submit my full response as a comment. I had reached the "maximum characters for a comment". Thus, I placed my reply to your suggestion as an answer. I hope the output is useful.

Are you able to still help?

I have fixed the issue! I had some Make files within my .src folder in catkin_ws that were not supposed to be there. Once I had deleted them, I rebuilt catkin_ws with catkin_make and later catkin_make install. Everything was built correctly and my issue was gone.
