Q:

Bumpers and p2os

Hi, I have discovered that p2os does not provide bumpers access, is there any way to do it by myself?
Thanks in advance.

A:

rosaria publishes bumper data if you want to use that instead.
Or, if you want to implement bumpers in p2os_driver you could do it similar to the existing sonar, gripper, etc data.   See the robot manual for details on the Pioneer communications protocol.   If you do it, send a pull request (request to merge) to allenh's git repository so that they can include your additions.
