Q:

Ros Offline Installation

Hi,
I am now working on Debian which I do not have root privilage access so I am not able to do sudo command. Is there a solution I can download the ROS packages and install it to directories that I can access?
note: I notice that the similar question has been asked, but the solution does not work for me.
Best,
Kang

Please clarify, are you looking for offline installation or non privledged installation(aka non root)?

A:

I'm not sure, if this is the easiest way, but you can just download the packages and extract their contents like so:dpkg -x pkg.deb somedir and then copy the ros files to a local ros directory.
Once you have setup the base ros files the extra packages shouldn't be that difficult as you only need to add their content to the stacks directory.
There will be no dependency tracking and it might even be easier (workwise) to just install ros from source without the debian packages.
