Q:

build newest mavlink(2015.12.12) in ros indigo

Hi, I try to build newest mavlink (2015.12.12) and mavros (0.16.3) in odroid xu4 installed ubuntu 14.04 and ros indigo followed mavros source installation.
I am using catkin build from catkin_tools to build those packages. After build successfully and source environments for sure.
And I can roscd mavros  go to PATH/src/mavros/mavors.
but roscd mavlink just go to old one in opt/ros/indigo/share/mavlink.
Any suggestions will be appreciate.
printenv | grep ROS:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/odroid/Skywalker/src/mavros/mavros_msgs:/home/odroid/Skywalker/src/mavros/libmavconn:/home/odroid/Skywalker/src/mavros/mavros:/home/odroid/Skywalker/src/mavros/mavros_extras:/home/odroid/Skywalker/src/mavros/test_mavros:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

A:

Actually, the mavlink package was build successfully. Maybe that package is not catkin package so that could't find by roscd. Thanks all.
