please can you tell me how you used explore stack in gazebo ?

i tried it ,it begin to draw the map, but it didn't move on rviz without teleop

A:

you have to change tranform tolerance, set it to something like 0.5
and you have to decrease update_frequency in global costmap params and local costmap params. it is  stated to have them same in navigation tuning wiki

ok thanks, the warning are now gone. but i have still a problem, i dont publish anything on the slam_entropy topic, which pkg publishes there something ? do you have some advise ?
Comment by cagatay on 2012-07-17:
gmapping publsihes entropy, maybe slam_entropy can be remapped type of it
Comment by pkohout on 2012-07-17:
remapping works, the explore nodes subscribes it...but still nothing happens.... did i have to call a service or so that the explore node starts exploring or so ??
Comment by cagatay on 2012-07-19:
yes it can subscribe it but is remapped topic  being published ?
Comment by pkohout on 2012-07-19:
nope remapped topic does not publish anything ://

now it all get published and subscribed, but i get the following info after starting exploration:Done exploring with 0 goals left that could not be reached. There are 0 goals on our blacklist, and 0 of the frontier goals are too close to them to pursue. The rest had global planning fail to them.
