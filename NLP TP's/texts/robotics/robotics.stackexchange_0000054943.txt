Q:

"Time jumped forward" in gmapping

I'm using slam_gmapping like in link:this tutorial, but with a live scanner and I'm getting messages like "Time jumped forward by [0.010211] for timer of period [0.010000], resetting timer (...)".
I am running it from a single computer (except rqt_logger_level) so I guess clock synchronisation shouldn't be the cause. But I updated both clocks with ntpdate to be sure (which didn't help).
I noticed that the problem seems to get worse if there is more load on the computer. Could the load be the cause? And in that case is there a way to increase the size of the allowed time jumps? (Or is there an other way to reduce the load for gmapping?)
