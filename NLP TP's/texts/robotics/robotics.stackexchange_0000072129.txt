Q:

PassThrough nodelet with more than one field

Dear ROS users, I am using the passthrough nodelet (link text) on a point cloud. Setting one field parameter (like in the tutorial) works. What I want to do is to use the nodelet to filter all the fields (x, y, z) at the same time. Since the param "filter_field_name" is only one, how I can achieve that?
Thanks!

Respected member I am very much new to ROS and I exactly want to filter the xyz all at one so have you got any launch file for this? Kindly share it I will be very much thankful to you.

A:

Although it doesn't seem to be currently documented on the wiki, the pcl_ros package also has a nodelet available for a crop box filter (feel free to add your own documentation!). You can see the description of the crop box filter here, and the dynamic reconfigure config file for the crop box filter should tell you what parameters to set and what they do.
