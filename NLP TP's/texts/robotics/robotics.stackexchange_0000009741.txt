Q:

Principle of virtual force - General help in understanding / explanation

I'm an Electronics student taking a module in Robotics. 
From the example,

I understand line 1 as the Jacobian is found from the time derivative of the kinematics equation and such relates joint angles to velocity.
I do not understand why the transpose has been taken on line 3 and how line 4 is produced.

A:

How the third equation is used in the derivation would be helpful in order to explain why $\delta x$ is being transposed.   But when you take $$\delta x = J \delta q$$ and transpose it, you must reverse the order of the terms of the right hand side.   This makes sense if you consider the dimensions of $J$.   If $x \in \Re^n$ and $q \in \Re^m$ then $J$ is $n$ x $m$.  To postmultiply $q^T$ (which is 1 x $m$) you must transpose $J$.  
The fourth equation is just a statement that the seesaw is in equilibrium - the total moment is zero.
