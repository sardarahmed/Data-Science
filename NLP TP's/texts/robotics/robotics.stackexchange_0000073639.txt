Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Laser 3D map

Hi, I am going to use a Velodyne
VLP-16 to create a 3D map. It is
going to go on a  moving "robot/car"
so it will likely have the wheel
odometry. The algorithm does not need
to run in real time.
Currently I get to publish the
PointCloud2 from the device. I need
to create a 3D map by combining these
pointclouds. I use ROS Indigo, could
ypu give me some advice about what
package could I use?  loam seemed
pretty good but it has been removed
from public access, I got to use a
old version but it sometimes loses
the odometry.
I would like to know the process of
what I have to do to create a 3D map
from different pointclouds; and what
packages should I use. I have seen
things like octomap, but I am not
sure if that is what I need.

Thanks a lot!!

Octomap seems popular and is worth trying. You may also want to sub-sample to an appropriately-sized voxelgrid or similar filter.

ok, would I have just to suscribe octomap to the velodyne pointCloud2 topic to do make de 3D map? or would I also have to provide a tf, odom, or something like that?

I asked a similar question here and the response was that you'll still need to provide transforms to octomap for it to combine (register) the point clouds to create a 3D map.
Comment by Kailegh on 2016-06-13:
and what was your solution to provide the location? using an IMU?

A:

I don't have any personal experience with octomap, but looking at the docs there appear to be several options:

a standalone library with no ROS dependencies

a ROS wrapper package with various message conversion functions

You probably do want to provide appropriate transforms to the odom coordinate frame.
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable will provide additional suggestions.
