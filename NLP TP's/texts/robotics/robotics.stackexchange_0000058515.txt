A:

I suppose you are working in python, so I suggest you to look at this tutorial.
You can see the message type of a topic using the command rostopic info /topic_name, in your case the message type should be sensor_msgs/LaserScan.

Hi,
I already know my topic name, but I use my script to listen the robot. SO, I need the laserscan data. However,   I have no idea how to extract the laser scan data.
thx!

maybe I didn't understood the question, but is the message type what you need? As I said use the command rostopic info /topic_name, where /topic_name is the name of your laser topic (should be sensor_msgs/LaserScan) then in your code (look at the tutorial) use from sensor_msgs.msg import LaserScan to import what you need.

Again, look at the tutorial I linked in my answer. This assumes obviously that you have done the previous tutorials and that you have programming knowledge in python (or C++).
