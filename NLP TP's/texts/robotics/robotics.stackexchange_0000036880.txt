Q:

how to create a .launch file with a node developed with ROSJava

I would like to create a .launch file to use the command:
roslaunch robot.launch

But, I don't know how to translate the following shell call into a .launchfile:
rosrun rosjava_bootstrap run.py bumperCar 
org.lejos.ros.nodes.bumpercar.BumperCarControl __name:=BumperCarControl

Any help?

A:

You'll want to add an extra args="" parameter to your <node> tag. For more information, take a look at the XML docs for <node>
EDIT: Try something like:
<node pkg="rosjava_bootstrap" type="run.py" args="bumperCar org.lejos.ros.nodes.bumpercar.BumperCarControl" name="BumperCarControl" />

I get the message "Can't locate 'run.py' in 'rosjava_bootstrap' ".  I can launch it fine when I use ./build/install/bin/test theTest
