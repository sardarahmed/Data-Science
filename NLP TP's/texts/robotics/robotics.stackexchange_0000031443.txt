Q:

set revolute joint start angle

I'd like to know if it's possible to set a start angle which is not 0 directly in the urdf.
By default on our arm, when all the joints are at 0, the arm is pointing down (through the floor if you import it directly in Gazebo, without attaching it to a table). It would be better if I could specify default values for the joint angles.

Hi,
Please take a look at the service call gazebo/set_model_configuration in gazebo wiki to set pose of the robot.  The strategy I've tested here is:

start simulation paused.
call gazebo/set_model_configuration with list of joint angles
[if holding position, trigger controller reset to set new goals]
unpause simulation

Hope this helps.
John

You can do this entirely from launch functions, as spawn_model has an "-unpause" option
