Q:

Launch file for UWSim problem. How do you write the node?

The below code portion works to launch the default UWSim node, but how do you alter it to open any other scene?
 <!-- UWSim Node-->

  <node pkg="uwsim" type="uwsim" name="uwsim" />

ROS is not familiar territory for me, but I have worked through the turtlesim and have spent time poking at variations on --configfile /.../scene.xml
Any suggestions on how this works would be appreciated. I don't want to have to ditch this project.
Thanks.

Hi,
I usually use this code in my launch files:
<arg name="scene" default="cirs.xml" />
<node name="uwsim" pkg="uwsim" type="uwsim" args="--configfile $(arg scene)" output="screen" respawn="false" />

And launch it like this, using just the name of the scene (stored in  uwsim/data/scenes):
roslaunch {package} {launchfile} scene:=shipwreck.xml

Hope it works.
