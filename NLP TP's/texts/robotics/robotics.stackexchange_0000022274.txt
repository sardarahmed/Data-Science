Q:

Is there a way to send commands to the Staubli CS9 from remote system via TCP/IP??(like ur_rtde, urx libraries for UR robots)

I am new to ROS development and Staubli robots. Though i have some prior knowledge on UR5e, I am finding it hard to understand the architecture of Staubli and its other programming interfaces (like staubli robotics suite) and more importantly, is there a way to send commands to the robot from remote system via TCP/IP??(like ur_rtde, urx libraries for UR robots).
So can anyone suggest a beginners tutorial or a guide where i can get a good understanding on the staubli's architecture(VAL3, SRS) and its ROS interfacing. I am not able to find much information or troubleshooting tutorials in the internet (no idea why). It looked like a very closed loop for a beginner like me. Any help from your side would be very helpful.
Thanks in advance. As i can't find any good forums (like UR forums) for Staubli (please suggest one,if anyone knows) , I thought this would be helpful for me.

A:

First I want to say that I do work for Staubli. While Staubli does not directly support ROS, others have done some development work using ROS with our robots. most of them were with the older CS8C controller.
There is a github depository with a driver that should work with the both the CS8C and the CS9 controller. I have not actually used this driver.
