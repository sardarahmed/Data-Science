Q:

Compilation error while installing Moveit from source

Hello everyone,
I was trying to do source based installation of recently released "Moveit". When the installation reached 61% I am getting the following error:

[ 60%] Building CXX object moveit_ros/planning/trajectory_execution_manager/CMakeFiles/test_controller_manager.dir/test/test_app.cpp.o

I tried uninstalling ROS,reinstalled it again without debian based moveit and it gives the same issue. Please help me on this.
I am working on
*ROS-GROOVY
*Ubuntu 12.04

What version of moveit are you using? It's likely that recent versions of moveit are not fully backwards compatible with Groovy.
Comment by Abdul Mannan on 2016-10-20:
Yes, it is not compatible for previous versions.

A:

Current moveit is not compatible to previous versions of ROS. So, maybe that's the reason. Also, current version of moveit is also not compatible to ROS-Kinetic.

Just a comment on the "not compatible to ROS-Kinetic": that's actually not entirely accurate. A release of MoveIt for Kinetic is in the works, and can already be built from sources. See the instructions on the website. If something doesn't work, report it.
