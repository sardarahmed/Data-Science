Q:

problem with detecting the single-color objects

Hi all,
which package can be used to detect the single-color objects?
I already used re_kinect_object_detector package and it works well with textured objects but it can't work successfully with single-color objects
thanks in advance

A:

It can't really do full object detection, but you could use cmvision to get started just detecting single-color blobs. After that, you would probably have to apply some criteria to distinguish different object, depending on your application.
