Where did you get these instructions from?  These are not the standard wa to install the kinect drivers.

A:

If you would like to view images coming from the kinect camera, follow the instructions posted here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect and here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_camera
which are summarized as follows:

install openni_kinect: sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect
run openni: roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
run image viewer: rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_color
