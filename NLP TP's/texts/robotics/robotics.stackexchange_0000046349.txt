Q:

Rosmake fails due to CMake issues after upgrade to Groovy

Hi all,
I recently upgraded to groovy and subsequently have had problems building any package what so ever. The error is as follows:
  mkdir -p bin
  cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/ros/groovy/share/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
  CMake Error at build/CMakeFiles/CMakeSystem.cmake:1 (INCLUDE):
    include could not find load file:
  
      /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake
  Call Stack (most recent call first):
    
  
  
  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (include):
    include could not find load file:
  
      /opt/ros/groovy/share/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake
  
  
  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (rosbuild_init):
    Unknown CMake command "rosbuild_init".
  
  
  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

I removed all of the fuerte packages, so /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake should be missing. Could anyone provide any insight into what is going on and how can I fix it?

A:

This problem appeared to be that the old fuerte CMake files were still in the directory. Running "rosmake --pre-clean" appears to resolve the immediate issue.
