Q:

Load Gazebo World into rviz

Hey there,
I just would like to know if it is possible to load a gazebo world or parts of it (Gazebo Models) into rviz directly?
Without loading and spawning the robots (robot_descriptions) in launch files before hand?
I am currently using Indigo and Gazebo 2. I guess there is no fast way to do that as gazebo only publishes these topics:
/gazebo/link_states
/gazebo/model_states
/gazebo/parameter_descriptions
/gazebo/parameter_updates
/gazebo/set_link_state
/gazebo/set_model_state

Best,
Markus

A:

The typical answer to this is "no", as RViz does not support loading .sdf files.
However, there is at least one package (that I know of) that implements a 'trick': gazebo2rviz. From the packages wiki page:

This package contains nodes to automatically import all entities simulated in a ROS-enabled Gazebo instance into rviz through the TF and Marker plugin.

I'm not sure how well supported it still is (or which specific versions of Gazebo are supported), but it would seem to do what you ask for.

I just would like to know if it is possible to load a gazebo world or parts of it (Gazebo Models) into rviz directly?

Note that technically this is not an answer (as the answer is really "no"), but gazebo2rviz provides a convenient work-around (if it still works).
