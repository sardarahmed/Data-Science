Q:

shutdown alll nodes

Hi,
I want to shutdown all nodes from within a ros node. ros::shutdown() kills the current node but does not kill the other nodes.
I know that all nodes can be killed using the terminal and through the launch file. But I test if a certain condition is met and only in such a circumstance I want all the nodes to shutdown.
Thanks!

A:

If all your nodes are launched by a single launch file, you could make your checking node required and let it stop itself to take down the whole launch file. If you have several launch files, have a required node in each launch and connect the killer nodes with bonds.
