Q:

Openni skeleton tracker does not post transforms

Hi,
i am trying to use the openni skeleton tracker with kinect. We are starting openni with default parameters and openni_tracker:
$ roslaunch openni openni.launch
$ rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker

And it basically seems to detect the human and the PSI-pose, but i cannot get any visualization in RVIZ. As far as i understand the code, the skeleton-transforms should be posted via tf? Also i cannot find the "Prime Sense User Tracker Viewer" anywhere...

A:

what are your RVIZ configs ? you have to add a tf frame to rviz!
Enter "rostopic list" command in console and make sure that tf topic is exist and also do a "rostopic echo /tf" to make sure that transforms are posted to tf topic!
I think something similar to "Sense User Tracker Viewer" is exist in pi_tracker package!

Sorry for late, the pi_tracker worked for us!

Thanks for your answer. I already added tf to the RVIZ config and checked if the transforms are beiing sent with 'rostopic echo /tf', but only the camera frames appear... I will test with the pi_tracker package now...
