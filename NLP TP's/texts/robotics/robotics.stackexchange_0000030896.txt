Q:

Filtering out robot parts from pointcloud data

What is the recommended way of filtering out robot parts (of which URDF is available) in pointclouds? I am aware of the robot_self_filter package, but this still uses the old PointCloud format and has unstable ROS and C++ APIs per the docs, so I thought that with all the recent advances in RGB-D sensors/PCL etc. there might be alternatives.

Well, 24 hours without an answer. I would take that as confirmation that the robot_self_filter package is still the recommended way to do it.

Hi Martin,
The documentation on the wiki is outdated. The robot_self_filter does subscribe to PointCloud2 messages now.

Oh ok, thanks. That'll teach me to look into the wiki ..better to directly look at source code hehe.
