Q:

a problem after "rosrun openni_camera openni_node"

After I run the command "rosrun openni_camera openni_node",it shows as below:
/opt/ros/electric/stacks/openni_kinect/openni_camera/bin/openni_node: relocation error: /opt/ros/electric/stacks/perception_pcl/pcl/lib/libpcl_visualization.so.1.1: symbol __cxa_pure_virtual, version libmysqlclient_16 not defined in file libmysqlclient.so.16 with link time reference
Is there anyone who can tell me why?

A:

Try this:
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16

If the command above didn't work,  make sure to check that the update repositories are enabled by checking /etc/apt/sources.list, you may need this.
