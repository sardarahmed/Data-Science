Q:

Error: No such file or directory

I am trying to run the command rosrun svmlight extract_pc_features. Here svmlight is a user defined package which is in the ros environment path. I am getting the following error once I run the command.
/opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rosrun: line 73: /home/shahriar/ucfWorkspace/svmlight/bin/extract_pc_features: No such file or directory

But my extract_pc_features in in that location.
shahriar@iqbal:~/ucfWorkspace/svmlight/bin$ ls
background_subtraction  calc_intersection    filterRect
baseline                centroid_grasp       rank
boost_training          extract_pc_features  showRect

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

A:

Occasionally, you'll see a 'file not found' error if the interpreter that's supposed to run a particular executable can't be found.
This can happen if you have a #! at the beginning of your file that is either misspelled, or references an interpreter that doesn't exit.
It can also happen if you're trying to execute a non-native binary, and the kernel can't find an appropriate interpreter. I've usually seen this when trying to run i386 or ARM binaries on x86_64.

Thank you for your answer.
I got over the previous problem..
Now I am getting this error...
/home/shahriar/ucfWorkspace/svmlight/bin/extract_pc_features: error while loading shared libraries: libopencv_core.so.2.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

If you've solved this problem, you should indicate how you solved it, to help others who have the same problem. Your missing library error sounds like a new problem, and you should ask it as a new question.
