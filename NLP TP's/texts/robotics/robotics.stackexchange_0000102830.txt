Q:

How to pass Pointcloud2 message to PCL smoothing algorithm?

I am following the ROS PCL tutorials , When I try to implement the Smoothing and normal estimation based on polynomial reconstruction algorithm  I get the following error
error

C2664: 'void
pcl::PCLBase::setInputCloud(const
boost::shared_ptr<const
pcl::PointCloud> &)': cannot
convert argument 1 from 'const
pcl::PCLPointCloud2ConstPtr' to 'const
boost::shared_ptr<const
pcl::PointCloud> &'

    with
    [
        PointInT=pcl::PointXYZ,
        PointT=pcl::PointXYZ
    ]
    and
    [
        PointT=pcl::PointXYZ
    ]

How to pass PointCloud2 message to this algorithm?

A:

The conversion function is named  pcl::fromROSMsg() from ros package pcl_conversions. Also see answers to #q405219.
