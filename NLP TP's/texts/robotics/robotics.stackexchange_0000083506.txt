Q:

How to read the actual date in ROS

Hey!,
I would like to name some archives, which I create in a ROS node, with a string related to the actual date on which the node is called. I already have used Ros time, but I dont know what does this "absolute" time means.
My code is:
ros::Time begin = ros::Time::now();
ROS_INFO("%d\n", begin.sec);

And the output is:
[ INFO] [1508853591.867555047, 1508853591.867143646]: 1508853591

My questions are, what does this "1508853591" means? And how could I get something like 24-10-2017-16:13 or like it?
Thanks!

A:

It may not look like it, but you already have "the actual date" there. It's just encoded as a Unix Timestamp or epoch, which is:

the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970.

To convert it into a date-time string, see #q251966, or lookup any of the myriad ways to convert a Unix epoch into any other date-time representation. This is not ROS specific, so don't limit your searches to pages about it.
