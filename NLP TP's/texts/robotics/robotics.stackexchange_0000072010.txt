Q:

how to do slam with a custom robot in Gazebo?

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to build a map using SLAM(gmapping) and my own (virtual) robot which is equipped with a hokuyo LRF under Gazebo, i have looked around but could not find a tutorial on how to do this.
for example
http://wiki.ros.org/robotino_navigation/Tutorials/Mapping%20with%20Robotino
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Build%20a%20map%20with%20SLAM
these tutorials don't explain how to do it with a customized robot.
my question is how do i obtain the laser scan data and pass it to the corresponding listener? I've noticed in some tutorials it is published by a topic named /base_scan,which does not appear when i load the model into the Gazebo environment.
Any suggestions or help will be much appreciated.
Thanks!
