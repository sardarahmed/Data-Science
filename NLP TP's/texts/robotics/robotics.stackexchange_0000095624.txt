Q:

MoveIt MSA configuration files not as straight forward as they say?

I have been struggling introducing my custom .xacro into MoveIt.  I have followed the MSA to a T.
I attempted the Panda MoveIt tutorials first, and they work perfectly.
My robot already works in Rviz in conjunction with Joint State Publisher so I know it operates correctly in its range of motion.
I have also been able to manually boot it into an empty gazebo world.  I am just having trouble creating and utilizing the files that are generated from the MSA.
When I follow the instructions from https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html?highlight=moveit and attempt to "roslaunch moveit_config demo.launch" I get this response...
(I cannot post a screenshot without 5 points (?) so I C->P'd)
homefolder@ubuntu:~/manipulator_ws$ roslaunch version1_desc demo.launch

The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

The workspace is named "manipulator_ws." My main package is "version1_desc" and when I started the MSA, I opened the new package into this "version1_desc".  So the config files that the MSA has created are located in:
manipulator_ws/src/version1_desc/moveit_config/config

and
manipulator_ws/src/version1_desc/moveit_config/launch

I remember reading that creating a package inside a package usually brings up issues, so this part of the creation process confused me. As soon as the MSA created a package in a package, I assumed this would not work, and it didn't.
I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
ROS Kinetic
Using Parallels Desktop on a 2019 macbook pro
This seems like a path problem but I am new to the system.  I have seen other posts with similar issues but the solutions that have been deemed worthy of "closing" do not provide clear solutions to my issue.
Can anyone offer some assistance? I have spent the better part of 5 hours moving stuff around and erasing and recreating these moveit_config files to no luck.  Im about ready to quit and go be a construction worker again.
please help.

Which is perfect, as there is no need to show a screenshot of an error message which is all text. It's also not allowed according to the support guidelines.

Finally as a suggestion: change the title of your question. As-is, it does not convey anything about what sort of problem you encountered. This makes it almost useless, as people searching will not get any hint about the topic your question.

This is great advice, all round. Thank you sir. I will work on my formatting as far at the questions go and appreciate the timely help.

I re-opened your question, as it's unclear to me why you closed it as a duplicate.
If it really is a duplicate, please post a link to the Q&A it is a duplicate of here in a comment.

A:

manipulator_ws/src/version1_desc/moveit_config/launch

I remember reading that creating a package inside a package usually brings up issues, so this part of the creation process confused me.

yes, this is your problem most likely.
Move the entire moveit_config directory (including all its contents) to manipulator_ws/src. Then delete the build, devel and install folders from your manipulator_ws (the last one only if it exists) and build your workspace again. Make sure to source devel/setup.bash after a successful build.
Now try again.
As to whether the MSA is "not as straight forward as they say?": in the end, it's the user which determines where the output of the MSA should be stored. If you direct it to generate the package inside another package, that's where the output will be generated.
I'm not entirely sure I understand why you did that, but that's not too important either.
