Q:

problem example ROS C++ no rule to make target libboost_signals

Hi,
I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10 server.
I installed ROS hydro base, and follow the examples, but when I'm trying to make the Publiser/Suscriber example (C++)
I have the following error
make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/libbost_signals-mt.so', needed by '/home/rosvm/catkin_ws/devel/beginner_tutorials/listener'. Stop.
make[1]: *** [beginner_tutorials/CMakeFiles/listener.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make" failed

A:

There is and there will be no Debian packages of Hydro for Ubuntu 13.10. You may either:

build Hydro from source (http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Source)

or use a supported platform for which Debian packages of Hydro are available (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html#hydro-medusa-aug-2013)
