Did you install ROS? Or merely want to install PCL on ubuntu? According to your question I can only suggest you this: http://pointclouds.org/downloads/

A:

The stand-alone PCL is not the version that works with ROS. On Ubuntu, you can install the correct version directly from the ROS repository:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pcl
