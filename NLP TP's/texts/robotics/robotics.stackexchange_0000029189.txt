Q:

Ignition Edifice examples fails to work properly

Hello!
I've been exploring Ignition Gazebo throw the examples and noticed that there are problems with examples with collada models. Either collada model visual is missing (like in camera_sensor.sdf for example) or model crashes (actor.sdf).

I'm experiencing the same problem on 2 PCs (nvidia quadro / nvidia gtx).
OS: Ubuntu 20.04
Ignition Edifice binary installation
Does anyone have such problem? Any solutions?

A:

This is a known issue with locales.
The quick workaround until that's fixed is to set this environment variable:
export LC_NUMERIC="C"
