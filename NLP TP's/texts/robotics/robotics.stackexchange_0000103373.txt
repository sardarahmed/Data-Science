Q:

ros2 remapping wildcard

Hello,
I try to remap a set of topic using the '**' wildcard as explain in http://design.ros2.org/articles/static_remapping.html#replacement-part-of-a-rule
I got the error :
rclpy._rclpy_pybind11.RCLError: failed to initialize rcl: Couldn't parse remap rule: '-r /fmu/in/**:=/px4_1/\1'. Error: Wildcard '**' is not implemented, at ./src/rcl/arguments.c:1167, at ./src/rcl/arguments.c:371

Have I written the rule wrong or does this wildcard really not implemented ?
Note: I got the same behaviour with '*'.
extract from my yaml file
  - node:
      remap:
        -
          from: '/fmu/*'
          to: '/px4_$(var i)/fmu/\\1'

A:

I am going to give you the answer you don't want to hear:
It is not implemented yet. See these issues:
https://github.com/ros2/rcl/issues/232
https://github.com/ros2/rcl/issues/233
https://github.com/ros2/rcl/issues/234
At least now you know...
