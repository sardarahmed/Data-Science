A:

have you checked out the navigation tutorials?
This should answer your question.
(At the time of this writing, the tutorials page is quite a mess. I'll clean that up later on...)
Of special interest for you are the following tutorials:
1, 4, 6, and 10-13
EDIT just fixed the wiki page, all clean now again...
