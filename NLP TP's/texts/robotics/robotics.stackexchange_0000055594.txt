Q:

Working with two ROS Versions on single system

Hi All,
I would like to install two versions of ROS --> Groovy and Hydro (or Groovy and Fuerte for example). Is it fine to work this way or should I have only one version of ROS installed? Has anyone tried this before?
Thanks
Murali

A:

Yes this is possible. If you install from e.g. Ubuntu packages they will install into /opt/ros/groovy and opt/ros/hydro.
Then you simply source the setup.bash file from the distribution you want to use.
NB: Be careful not to mix up the versions when you are running your robot. Sometimes it works, but other times it gives you some strange behaviour.
