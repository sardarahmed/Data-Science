Q:

Problem importing collada model

Recently i made a model of a tunnel in blender that looks like this:
I exported it to a Collada file but when i load the model into gazebo some parts of the model disappeared.
I am using gazebo 2.2.3.
Can you tell me what I am doing wrong?

A:

It looks like some of the normals are flipped. Try visualizing them in Blender and changing them where appropriate.
