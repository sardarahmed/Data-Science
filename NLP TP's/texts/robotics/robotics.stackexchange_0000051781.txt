Q:

Smach : how to launch rqt_smach?

Hello everyone,
I'm studying the Smach stack on ROS Groovy (compiled from sources) and I would like to use the smach viewer but it doesn't work anymore and seems to have been replaced by rqt_smach. The problem is that the rqt_smach page doesn't explain how to use it. I tried to rosrun rqt_smach rqt_smach or rqt_smach rqt_smach.py but without any success.
Somebody knows how to make it work ?
Regards,

A:

AFAIK, rqt_smach isn't completed yet according to this conversation, and I'm not sure what happened to smach_viewer.
I still have an interest to take over the development of rqt_smach but can't guarantee.
