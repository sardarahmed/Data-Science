Just to make sure: do you need to build AMCL from source?
On Kinetic, it's available as a Deb package and sudo apt install ros-kinetic-amcl should install it.

A:

Are you trying to build the noetic-devel version on Ubuntu Xenial/ROS Kinetic?
This is the dependency declaration in noetic-devel (from here):

<test_depend>python3-pykdl</test_depend>

The kinetic-devel version doesn't have this dependency.
If you want to build amcl from source on Xenial, you probably want to build the Kinetic version.
Alternatively: you'll have to update the dependency list to be Kinetic/Xenial compatible.

Basically, what he said :-) (Posted as an answer but was late...)
python3-pykdl is not available on xenial.
Note that for xenial and thus ROS kinetic (I'm assuming your using that, you haven't specified this anywhere), the default python version is Python2.7. You should make sure to only use packages that rely on Python 2. Otherwise you might run into a lot of errors.
My guess is you downloaded the amcl source code from the noetic-devel branch. You should probably go back to the kinetic-devel branch. (You could obviously comment the dependency, as it is a test dependency only. It might work then, or it might not. Who knows....)
In the long run, you should probably upgrade from xenial/kinetic to something else (I'd suggest focal/noetic), as kinetic is EOL end of the month and won't receive any updates and fixes anyways...
