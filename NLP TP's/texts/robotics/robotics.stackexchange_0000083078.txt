Q:

Universal Robot: can I access the joint currents in ROS?

I am successfully able to command my UR10 from a ROS node.  I'm using Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic, the ROS universal robot package, and the ROS ur_modern_driver package (plus a minor code fix that I found on the Internet to make it compile under Ubuntu 16.04).
When I use the pendant to control the arm, I occasionally look at the joint current amperage values on the log tab in order to make decisions.  Mostly when picking up payloads or dropping them off.  Is there a way to access the real-time joint currents from ROS?  Or am I just trying to do it all wrong?

A:

The i_actual field from the 'real-time interface' datastream is currently being used to populate the effort field of the JointState msg published on the /joint_state topic (see RosWrapper::publishRTMsg() - line 676).
See document 16496 on the UR support site for more information about what i_actual actually represents.

Wow.  Thanks!  I noticed this effort field when I first installed the UR drivers, but I didn't understand what it was for.

Note that I'm not entirely convinced that using i_actual like that for effort is correct. But that is orthogonal to your question.
