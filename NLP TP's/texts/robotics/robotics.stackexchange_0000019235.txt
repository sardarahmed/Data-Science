Q:

How come LIDAR is not commonly used for indoor navigation?

I'm reading this survey on the state-of-the-art techniques for indoor positioning and navigation. I noticed that LIDAR isn't mentioned at all in the paper. Is LIDAR not meant to be a common method for indoor navigation? I believe I've seen some industrial LIDAR robots some time ago though.

A:

I think LiDAR is common for indoor navigation. Definitely, LiDAR is the easiest and accurate solution for indoor navigation or SLAM. Many commercial robot vacuums are already in use of LiDAR for indoor navigation and mapping. Those are even cheaper and simpler than RGBD modules which is why low-cost LiDARs are hired over RGBD in mass production models.
It is just that indoor navigation is a vast topic. I haven't seen any survey paper that covers all types of sensors. We can't cover few thousands of papers in a single survey paper. The paper you linked has some specific coverage and it is ok not to mention other sensors out of the scope such as LiDAR or camera.
