Q:

Problem on loading caster wheel of tutorial

Dear Gazebo Users,
I am a newbie user of Gazebo. Following the tutorial described in http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_robot&ver=1.9%2B&cat=build_robot, I get error when I try to add caster element.
This is what I get:
Warning [parser.cc:713] XML Element[collision], child of element[model] not defined in SDF. Ignoring[collision]. You may have an incorrect SDF file, or an sdformat version that doesn't support this element.
Warning [parser.cc:713] XML Element[visual], child of element[model] not defined in SDF. Ignoring[visual]. You may have an incorrect SDF file, or an sdformat version that doesn't support this element.
Thank you for your support!

A:

It seems like you're trying to put <visual> and <collision> elements directly inside <model>. Make sure you put them into <link> like this:
<model ...>
  <link ...>
    <visual ...> ... </visual>
    <collision ...> ... </collision>
  </link>
</model>
