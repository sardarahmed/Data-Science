Q:

[SOLVED] pcl_ros: how to find cloud frame

Dear all,
I am using pcl_ros package, with pcl 1.6 and ROS groovy.
I am subscribing to a PointCloud2 topic, using a callback like this:
void MainWindow::xtionCloudCallback(const pcl::PointCloudpcl::PointXYZRGB::ConstPtr& cloud)
is it possible to get the cloud frame? if I transform the cloud using a TransformListener tf, e.g.:
pcl_ros::transformPointCloud("/map", *cloud, *tcloud, tf);
this function is able to retrieve the cloud frame in some way, how do I get it?

A:

Any stamped (i.e. containing timing/transform info) message will have a header (e.g. PointCloud) that contains the relevant timestamp and frame id.
cloud->header.frame_id

thanks, I was thinking I had a pcl::PointCloudpcl::PointXYZRGB from the PCL library, not a message from ROS (with a header) with the same classname

pcl::PointCloud<> has a header with stamp and frame_id as well, however those are not compatible the ROS message format, so you have to use the converter utilities in pcl_ros.
