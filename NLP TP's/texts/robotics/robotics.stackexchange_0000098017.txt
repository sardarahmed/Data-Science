Q:

rvis doesn't draw model correctly

I'm using ROS Kinetic via a Docker image on my Windows 10 machine.  I have xserver setup so I can run GUIs.  When I run RVIS and load the URDF for my IRB 120 it draws the mesh incorrectly.  I tried a fix posted in another thread but it didn't work.  Any ideas?   I've uploaded the image of what draws.
please note I've tried *export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
*

Are you using a http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher node?

not sure. the tube representation of the bot renders correctly and moves like it should.  I'll try.

The RobotModel display seems to be in error-mode. Could you expand it and tell us what those errors are?
Also:

"it didn't work" isn't very informative. Neither is "a fix".

I'm referring to export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" which is posted as a solve in another almost identical thread of a robot drawing like this in RVIS and it doesn't work for me so it isn't a fix for this issue

I am running a joint state publisher

Error on the RobotModel is No transform from [base] to [common_world] and that repeats for each joint

A:

solved by changing my fixed frame to base from common_world
