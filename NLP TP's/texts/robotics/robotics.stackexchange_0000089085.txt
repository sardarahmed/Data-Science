Q:

How to load two seperate nodelets in the nodelet manager

Hi, I have two nodelets in separate files(one publishes sensor_msgs::Image  and the other subscribes to it) and want to load them in the nodelet manager. ROS does provide a method here but I fail to understand the details of it. Thanks in advance.

A:

To load your nodelets you must have loaded a nodelet manager first.

Using command lines :

Load the nodelet_manager (you can put the name you want but make sure all your nodelets use the same manager)
rosrun nodelet nodelet manager __name:=nodelet_manager
Then you can load your nodelets (again replace nodelet_manager with the name you chose previously), if you have two nodelets you have to run :
rosrun nodelet nodelet load PACKAGE_OF_YOUR_NODELET/NODELET1 nodelet_manager
rosrun nodelet nodelet load PACKAGE_OF_YOUR_NODELET/NODELET2 nodelet_manager

Using launch file :
< node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="nodelet_manager" args="manager"/>
< node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="NODELET1"
args="load PACKAGE_OF_YOUR_NODELET/NODELET1 nodelet_manager">
< /node>
< node pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="NODELET2"
args="load PACKAGE_OF_YOUR_NODELET/NODELET2 nodelet_manager">
< /node>

You can also set a parameter or remap some topics as in the tutorial.
I personnaly prefer to use launch files.
But always remember that the nodelet manager is mandatory here and if by mistake you load your nodelets in two different nodelet_manager you will lose the specificity of the nodelets and they will have the same behavior as a node.

I forgot to add this useful command :
rosrun nodelet declared_nodelets

This will list all the available nodelets on your system (from wiki section 2)
