Q:

Finding rotation quaternion

I am trying to use a quaternions for robotics and there is one thing I don't understand about it. Most likely because I don't understand how to define position with quaternions and how to define rotation with quaternions if there is any difference..
Please watch my "understanding steps" and correct if I am wrong somewhere.
Lets assume I we have 2 vehicle positions described by 2 rotation quaternions:
$$
q_1 = w_1 + x_1i + y_1j +z_1k = \cos(\pi/4) + \sin(\pi/4)i
$$
This quaternion is normalized and represents rotation over the $x$ axis for $\pi/2$ angle as I understand it.
$$
q_2 = w_2 + x_2i + y_2j + z_2k = \cos(\pi/4) + \sin(\pi/4)k
$$
And this one represents rotation for the same angle $\pi/2$ over the $y$ axis.
$q_1*q_2 = q_3$ which would be the same rotation as if we made $q_1$ first and $q_2$ second. 
$$q_3 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2} +\frac{j}{2} +\frac{k}{2}$$
QUESTION 1: Given $q_2$ and $q_3$ how can I find $q_1$?
QUESTION 2: How to find a rotation angle over some other vector, given rotation quaternion? For example I want to find on what angle does $q_3$ turned over $2i+j-k$ quaternion.

A:

Quaternions
Mathematical definition
$\mathcal{H} := \{ h_{1} + h_{2}i + h_{3}j + h_{4}k : h_{1},h_{2},h_{3},h_{4} \in \Re$ and $ i^{2} = j^{2} = k^{2} = ijk = -1  \}$
A pure quaternion can be defined as:
$\mathcal{H}_{p} := \{ p \in \mathcal{H} : Re(p)=0\}$
Pure quaternions can be associated to vectors.
Translation
Since pure quaternions are directly related to vectors, you can add two pure quaternions to form a third one.  Observe the figure, were we represent a pure quaternion and the real axis is omitted: 

Rotation
A general rotation of $\phi$ around an arbitrary unit norm rotation axis n is givem by:
 

QUESTION 1: Given $q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ how can I find $q_{1}$?

If $q_{3} = q_{1}q_{2}$ and they are rotation quaternions:
$q_{3} = q_{2}q_{1}$
$q_{3}q_{2}^{*} = q_{1}q_{2}q_{2}^{*}$
Since $q_{2}^{*}q_{2} = 1 = q_{2}q_{2}^{*}$
$q_{1} = q_{3}q_{2}^{*}$
were the * states for the conjugate of a quaternion.

QUESTION 2: How to find a rotation angle over some other vector, given rotation quaternion? For example I want to find on what angle does $q_{3}$ turned over 2i+jâˆ’k quaternion.

If your vector is represented by $n$ and you know the $r$, your rotation angle will be the double of the angle you see.
Example:
$n = i + 0j + 0k$
$r$ = $q_{1} = cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + sin(\frac{\pi}{4})i$
from the formula presented in the section of rotation:
$\frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}$
$\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}$
Hope that was useful.
Best regards
