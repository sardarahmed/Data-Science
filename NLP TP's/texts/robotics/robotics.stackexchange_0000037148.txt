Q:

boost version problem

I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10, for which the default Boost version is 1.46. However, ROS seems to still depend on 1.42; if I want to install 1.46, it first wants to uninstall 1.42, but I can't uninstall 1.42 without uninstalling all of ROS. /opt/ros/electric/ros/rosdep.yaml lists a dependency on libboost1.46-all-dev for oneiric, though, which means rosmake refuses to build anything because of the unmet dependency.
Should I change rosdep.yaml to have libboost1.42-all-dev instead, or is there a better solution? Also, should I submit a bug report somewhere, or is this a problem only for me?

A:

I think your system is in a weird state because you have the natty versions of the ROS packages installed on an oneiric system.
I would start with 'apt-get dist-upgrade'
If that doesn't work, install libboost1.46-all-dev, allow it to remove ROS, and then you should be able to reinstall ROS and keep the newer version of boost.

It looks like that (and Rohling's comment) worked, thanks! It was too bad I had to reinstall ROS, since that takes forever... but it works with no problems now.
