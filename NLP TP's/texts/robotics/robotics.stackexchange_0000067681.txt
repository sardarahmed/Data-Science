Q:

Cannot access wiki after changing theme

Hello everyone,
I was changing the themes of the ROS wiki and after testing one of them I cannot use the wiki:

Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal
error or misconfiguration and was
unable to complete your request.
Please contact the server
administrator, [no address given] and
inform them of the time the error
occurred, and anything you might have
done that may have caused the error.
More information about this error may
be available in the server error log.
Apache Server at wiki.ros.org Port 80

Now, in order to use the wiki I had to clear the browser cache and use it anonymously. Whenever I try to login this wild error appears.
Does anybody know how I can restart the preferences of my wiki account?
Thanks!

A:

After logging in you might be able to go to: http://wiki.ros.org/?action=userprefs&sub=prefs to change your theme.
However if the theme is broken on that page too. I don't know how to manually override the theme.
Do you know what theme you tried? And what's your username?

My username is JavierVGomez and the theme is explorer. I have checked the error with a test account and the same is happening. I also tried to access from cache but didn't work. If you can just reset the account that is OK, as I have done nothing with it yet. Otherwise, I will create a new one.

I believe I've reverted your account to the rostheme. Please confirm.

I've disabled the theme too: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/roswiki/pull/131
