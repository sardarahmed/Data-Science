Q:

Create not going forward

Hi guys,
I have a weird one. I have been searching for a bit to try and find the answer to this, but there doesn't seem to  be anything on it here.
Basically, I have installed Turtlebot on Ubuntu 11.04, I have the standard netbook setup, diamondback.
I have also used my desktop computer running Ubuntu 10.04, and installed it on a Debian device.
In all three cases, the Create will not go forward, it will only turn left, right and backwards.
Is there some possibility that a flag is set? Something that doesn't allow it to go forward?
I would really appreciate your help on this. Thanks.

Hi. I am using the keyboard. I used "rostopic echo turtlebot_node/cmd_vel". I am getting a linear vel of 0.5 when pressing forward, but still no signs of life.
Comment by mmwise on 2011-09-06:
the cmd_vel is in the turtlebot_node namespace. You need to rostopic echo turtlebot_node/cmd_vel to see the commands. what are you using to command the robot to go forward? joystick, keyboard?

I am commanding it to go forward, but nothing more than the following appears.
rostopic echo cmd_vel WARNING: topic [/cmd_vel] does not appear to be published yet

Could you post the output from rostopic echo cmd_vel for a time when you're commanding it to go forward, but it isn't?

A:

This sounds like the bumper might be depressed.  Can you look in the diagnostics in the dashboard about whether the bumper is pressed.  There's also a parameter to allow driving even when the bumper is pressed.

Was the case of a depressed bumper.

Hi, there is a starter program that is on the Command Module that makes the robot just bump and drive. This goes forward without problem. Also, when I was performing the Calibration part of the Turtlebot setup, it was going forwards.

Hi, can I ask how do you apply these parameters when using the turtlebot_bringup? Thanks.
Comment by Brian Gerkey on 2011-09-09:
Similarly, it could be the wheeldrop sensors.  The parameter in question is ~stop_motors_on_bump.  It was missing from the docs; I've just added it (along with some other missing params): http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_node#Parameters.
