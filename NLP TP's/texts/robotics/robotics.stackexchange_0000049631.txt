Q:

Compile is successful, but no executable generated?

Hi guys,
I have created my own package in which I do some image processing with openCV and PCL. After compiling, I get no errors and the build is successful, However, no executable is generated in the /bin folder. Note: this is not my first package, I have created other nodes with no problem.
In the Cmakelist.txt, I have added the following lines
rosbuild_add_executable(myNode src/myNode.cpp)
rosbuild_add_library(myNode src/myNode.cpp)

Here is the output of the compilation:
[ rosmake ] Results:                                                            
[ rosmake ] Built 31 packages with 0 failures.                                  
[ rosmake ] Summary output to directory                                         
[ rosmake ] /home/samme/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20130322-160141   

When I run the command $rosun firefly_mv myNode I get:[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named myNode below /home/samme/fuerte_workspace/firefly_mv.
I am not sure why the executable is not being generated here, I have created many other nodes and never got this problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks and regards,
Khalid

Strange. Can you post the result of going into your "build" directory and there running "cmake ..;VERBOSE=1 make" - should show what it's doing while compiling. Peace.

A:

You are declaring a library with the same name as the executable AFTER the executable. My guess is that only the last one is generated.
You should not build the library, try commenting that out.
