Q:

Mapping between PWM counts and joint angle in ros_canopen

I'm using ros_canopen, which is an awsome package, to communicate with my robot.
By far, I modified the below yaml parameters to deal with the mapping between PWM counts and jont angle.
default:
  pos_to_device: "rint(rad2deg(pos)*1000)"
  pos_from_device: "deg2rad(obj6064)/1000" 
  vel_to_device: "rint(rad2deg(vel)*1000)" 
  vel_from_device: "deg2rad(obj606C)/1000"

Is there a way to use transmission ratio in URDF and define only a parameter of encoder resolution in the above yaml?
Thank you in advance.

A:

No, this is not implemented (yet?).
