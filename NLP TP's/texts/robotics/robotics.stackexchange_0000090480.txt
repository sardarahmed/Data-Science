Q:

[crystal] Is there a limit on the array.resize?

When I try to resize a embedded array only 128 values are printed.
After the 128 values, a  '...'] is shown.
This is when using ros2 topic echo.
Is this to be expected?

Yes, and it is also not a limit to array/list/sequence sizes in the message format (as your question seems to imply), but a usability feature.
The ROS 2 rostopic CLI tool by default will not print full length arrays for lists/arrays/sequences longer than 128 elements to prevent "runaway" terminals (where you are waiting 5 minutes for rostopic to quit after having rostopic echod a topic carrying PointCloud msgs fi).
You can disable/change this behaviour in two ways:

provide an alternative value with the --truncate-length option (here)
add --full-length to your echo invocation (here)

Note that this is similar to rostopic echo's --noarr in ROS 1 (although that didn't allow you to specify a limit to the nr of elements it did print).

Thank you for the information, I will try the above mentioned changes.
I was hopping to ask another question relating topic echo.
Embedded custom messages are not being printed with ROS2 topic echo but,
if I create a subscriber, the messages are properly being received.  Is this a setting issue?

That would seem to be a different question. Posting follow-up questions in comments on answered questions is not a good idea, as they have very limited visibility and will be hard to find for future readers.

Yea, sorry about that. I was just thinking that it might be related the rostopic echo setting as well. That is why I was debating whether to ask a different question or post it here.
Thank you for your answer though.

No problem.
