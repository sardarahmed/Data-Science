A:

What you need is to create a node that uses image transport and camera info manager. The image transport is the standard way to publish images in ROS and the second shares the calibrated camera information. I imagine that you will have to somehow broadcast the images from your phonte to the pc running ROS and then your node should receive and publish the video feed you receive.
Cheers...
