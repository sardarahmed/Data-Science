Q:

Passing power through a motor

How would one go about passing power through a motor?
Let's say we have some basic robot which has a motor that slowly spins a limb, on each end of that limb, there is a motor which again spins a limb. Because the first motor is always going to be spinning, any wires would twist and eventually break, so a wired approach wouldn't work. The same goes for the subsequent motors.
I know that dc motors use brushes to get past this, but how is this generally solved in engineering/robotics? This must be a problem that has come up before, and there must be a solution to it.
Any ideas? :)

A:

It is called a slip ring.

It works the same as a brushed motor.
See here for a robotic oriented one.
Larger versions handle power, and cost more.
Also near field technologies such as those used to wirelessly charge your electric toothbrush, and more recent wireless cell phone chargers, are potential solutions
