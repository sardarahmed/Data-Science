Q:

In ROS Kinetic, commands such as catkin_make give an error. (Python-catkin-pkg dependency broken)

Error content:
$ catkin_make
The program 'catkin_make' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install catkin

$ sudo apt install catkin
[sudo] password for developer: 
Reading package lists... Done

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 catkin : Depends: python-catkin-pkg but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

I uninstalled and reinstalled ROS, but I get the same error.
The same problem occurred in the following three environments.

Ubuntu 16.04 installed on desktop PC
Ubuntu 16.04 installed on a laptop PC
Ubuntu 16.04 installed on Windows 10 VMware

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Edit: Below is the installation guide.
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
It will be an already installed message.
However, catkin_make will not be installed.

$ sudo apt install catkin

Ubuntu is suggesting that because of the existence of upstream packages.
If you just want to install the "regular ROS packages", you'll want to install ros-kinetic-catkin, not catkin.
Can you tell us which installation guide / tutorial you've followed?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-05-09:\

$ catkin_make

The program 'catkin_make' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install catkin

just making sure: did you do a source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash before trying to run catkin_make?
That is needed as by default catkin_make will not be on the PATH.

A:

Thank you for your help.
When run after source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash, catkin_make worked correctly.
