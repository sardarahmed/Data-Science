Q:

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag: line 7, column 4

I am using kinetic version of ROS. I am a very new user to ROS. So I was trying to write a launch code that would launch two different launch files. One launch file is of husky_gazebo package, the other one is for teleop_twist_keyboard package. I am not sure if I can write a code that can launch these files together.
For my launch file I am getting following error:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag: line 7, column 4

below is my launch file:
<launch>

<include file="$(find husky_gazebo)/launch/husky_empty_world.launch">
<arg name="world_name" value="$(find gazebo-7)/worlds/robocup14_spl_field.world">
<arg name="laser_enabled" value="$(arg laser_enabled)"/>
<arg name="kinect_enabled" value="$(arg kinetic_enabled)"/>
</include>

<include file="$(find teleop_twist_keyboard)/teleop_twist_keyboard.py">
</include>

</launch>

A:

You need to change your first <arg> tag to be a self-closing tag <arg/>:
<arg name="world_name" value="$(find gazebo-7)/worlds/robocup14_spl_field.world"/>

Also, the <include> tag is for including other XML files: Check out the documentation:

The <include> tag enables you to import another roslaunch XML file into the current file...

You want to use the <node> tag instead to launch that node:
<node name="teleop_twist_keyboard" pkg="teleop_twist_keyboard" type="teleop_twist_keyboard.py"/>

So, your final launch file will look like
<launch>

<include file="$(find husky_gazebo)/launch/husky_empty_world.launch">
<!-- this tag below -->
<arg name="world_name" value="$(find gazebo-7)/worlds/robocup14_spl_field.world"/>
<arg name="laser_enabled" value="$(arg laser_enabled)"/>
<arg name="kinect_enabled" value="$(arg kinetic_enabled)"/>
</include>

<node name="teleop_twist_keyboard" pkg="teleop_twist_keyboard" type="teleop_twist_keyboard.py"/>

</launch>

Please see the documentation for the <node> tag.

Oh so sorry. It was a silly mistake.
