Q:

navigation , no message receive from trajectory planner!

Hi all,
i am running navigation with static map , but when i set a 2Dgoal in rviz robot doesn't move.
In rviz , state of local planner & global planner & planner plan, objects is warning with given info:"no  message receive !"
I am running roswtf and from the output i have realized that the only topics that are not connected are: "/move_base_simple/goal" & "/move_base/cancel"
Any ideas?
thanks in advance.

What do you have specified as the 2D nav goal topic in rviz?

What robot are you trying to run and what launch file are you using?

A:

Problem solved!
Rviz goal was not connected to /move_base_simple/goal , i have changed topics name to goal , then the problem solved!
