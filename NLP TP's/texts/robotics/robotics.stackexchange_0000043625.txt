Q:

How to get new stack/package installed into your Ubuntu?

I am a new learner of ROS. On my project, I need a new stack which is not installed by default, so I have tried the command "rosdep" while it dose not work, here is some results:
wbin@wbin:~$ rosdep install pr2_cockpit
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource pr2_cockpit
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/wbin/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros

Is any way to get new stacks/packages?

A:

To install a stack from source, it is recommended to use the tool rosws.
First you need to create an overlay. Have a look at this wiki page for information on how to do that. Then you can easily check add stacks from source using roslocate in combination with rosws merge or rosws --set as shown on the above wiki page. Given your overlay is set up correctly, you can check out pr2_cockpit as follows:
roslocate info pr2_cockpit | rosws merge -
rosws update

Thanks for the information Lorenz. I have used this method as well but somehow I felt the method I suggested more convenient and simple. Sure, I would try to make it a habit to use this new method hereafter. :)
