Q:

Unauthorized: {"error":"unauthorized","reason":"You are not a db or server admin."}

I'm following this tutorial .When i try to upload a bag file using:
 rosrun object_recognition_capture upload -a 'asaad' -e 'myemai@email.com' -i silk.bag -n 'silk' -d 'Silk brand soy milk.' --commit milk, soy, kitchen, tod

i get the following error:
Unauthorized: {"error":"unauthorized","reason":"You are not a db or server admin."}

I'm not very familiar with couchDB so please bear with this question( which i know is of a very basic nature).
The same happens when i try:
rosrun object_recognition_core push.sh

or any other such command related to COuchDB, for that matter.
I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 & ROS Hydro.

A:

what I believe is, you need a db account/profile associated with email you are using , It can be on your local system though pretty much the way GIT works on local systems and one makes commits and puch changes to that.

i have an account on the couchDB and am logged into it. i also started couchDB before trying to upload the content on couchDB but that didnt solve the problem.
