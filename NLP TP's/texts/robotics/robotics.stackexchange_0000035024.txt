Q:

ROS supported PCI/PCI express data acquisition (daq) card

Dear All
I am trying to read 6 channel Analog Input signal via ROS. My plan is to find one ROS supported PCI/PCI express DAQ card and plug it into my desktop PC. Has anyone know this type DAQ? Certainly if you have better idea to read 6 channel AI, please also let me know. Thanks a lot.

A:

The Sensoray 626 http://www.sensoray.com/products/626.htm seems to meet your requirements.
I've successfully used it with Ubuntu/ROS in the past, some code for installing the drivers and library can be found at http://www.ros.org/wiki/sensoray626
