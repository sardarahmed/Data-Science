Q:

how to use external libraries in ROS code?

Hi,
We have a GUI that was developed using Qt and now we are planning to use ROS in our code. Is it possible to integrate ROS with our existing Qt code?
In a general sense, how do we use external libraries such as Qt, OpenGL and user built libraries with ROS code?
Thank you.

A:

Not in the general sense, but rather specific to your question,
you can have a look at RGBD-SLAM which uses qt and opengl. The CMakeLists.txt and manifest can be found here
Check out main.cpp, qtros.h and qtros.cpp to see how we moved the ROS spinning into a subclass of QThread to run the callbacks in parallel to the Qt application's event loop.
(Update: The above links used to point to the repository http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/branches/freiburg_kinect-experimental/rgbdslam which no longer exists and have been updated to point at the github rgbdslam_v2 repo which may or may not illustrate what is described)

great, this worked for qt. I changed my CMakelits.txt similar to the one in the package and it works perfectly. I am posting a small description on how to do it in the below answer.
