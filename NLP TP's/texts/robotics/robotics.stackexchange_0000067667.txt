Q:

rqt_plot fixed y-axis limits

Hi,
I'm trying to fix the y-axis of rqt_plot to certain values but as soon as higher values appear, the y-axis rescales. I've found numerous threads autoscaling in rqt_plot but none provide me with a usable solution. I've tried:

pausing and setting the limits manually, but it simply resets after
turning off autoscroll and then setting the limits manually
all 3 possible backends
Set use only visible data in the widget but even then when higher values appear, the y-axis limits are expanded and not retracted when these high values are out of the view.

I'm running rqt_plot version 0.3.10. Thanks in advance!

A:

Sorry; this feature isn't implemented.
You can open a feature request ( https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues ) or attempt to implement it yourself (add an additional settings item which calls set_autoscale() )
Note that autoscale and autoscroll are two different things - autoscrolling repositions the X axis, and autoscale adjusts the Y axis bounds.

OK then that's why I couldn't find the feature. I'll see if I can open a feature request. Thanks for your quick response!
