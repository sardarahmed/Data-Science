Q:

Which OS should be put on Raspi 4 with 2 GB RAM to use ROS?

I have a RasPi 4 with 2 GB RAM. I want to run ROS on it (preferably melodic) and run some SLAM packages on it.
Which OS should I put on it ? Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop or Ubuntu 18.04 Server or Ubuntu MATE 18.04 ?
Also any advices on the swap space as RAM (2GB) is less and the packages I'll be using would be heavy ?
TIA

A:

I have run the melodic navigation stack on an Ubuntu Mate 18.04-based image published by Ubiquity Robotics.
I felt a lack of CPU power, not memory. In some cases, I had to reduce the frequency in the configuration, etc. to make it work.
Be careful when building something from the source, not the package, as it failed if you don't create a swap area.
