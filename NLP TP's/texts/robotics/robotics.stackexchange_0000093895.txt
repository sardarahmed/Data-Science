Q:

Missing joint trajectory controller

Hi!
I'm using ros melodic on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and when I try to make my workspace with catkin_make I get the following error message:
 CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "joint_trajectory_controller" with any of the following names:

    joint_trajectory_controllerConfig.cmake
    joint_trajectory_controller-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "joint_trajectory_controller" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "joint_trajectory_controller_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "joint_trajectory_controller"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver/ur_controllers/CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/bodon/catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
See also "/home/bodon/catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log".
Invoking "cmake" failed

And when I type the following command in a different but sourced terminal I get another error message:
command:  sudo apt-get install joint_trajectory_controller
error: E: Unable to locate package joint_trajectory_controller

Could please help me with this?

and this would be something for which it is perfectly fine to post it in a comment :)

A:

Have you made sure to install all dependencies before doing that?
Please refer to #q252478 for a possible workflow.
And to avoid an xy-problem: can you explain why you are building the joint_trajectory_controller from source on bionic?

Edit:

I followed this tutorial for UR robots: https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver

If with "this tutorial" you mean the steps listed in the Building section of the README, then those would seem to already include the rosdep install .. command described in #q252478.
Did you run those commands? Did they successfully complete? If not: what was the error output?

And I got the error when I tried to run catkin_make.

If dependencies have not been installed, you'll receive the error message you show.

About the xy_problem you're right. I tried to solve my first problem with that, following my friend's advice.

Always prefer to use binary packages over building things from source. Do not simply "build a package from source" if you run into the CMake error you show. That should be the absolute last resort.
I cannot repeat this often enough.  Please also tell your friend.
There are few exceptions, some of which are described here: #q320046.
Finally: if there are problems with the installation and setup guide of Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver, you should report those on the issue tracker.

Edit 2:

Following the Building, I get this error message after

$ sudo apt update -qq

450 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.

W: An error occurred during the signature verification. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F42ED6FBAB17C654

W: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/bionic/InRelease  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F42ED6FBAB17C654
W: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

Btw, I get other errors for the rosdep install line

You are using a machine (or a container) that has either not setup the ROS package repositories correctly, or is running into #q325039.
Note how the readme of Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver states:

This driver requires a system setup with ROS

So you'll have to make sure that has been done before following the instructions in the readme.

Just for completeness: what is the output of the following commands:
lsb_release -a
uname -rvmp
