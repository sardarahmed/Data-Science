Q:

Change log level ros2_control hardware interface

I use ros2_control with my own hardware interface. In this interface, I log some stuff in DEBUG. I would like to set log level to DEBUG in my launch file so that I can see these logs.
In other words, how can I set it for a controller launched using the spawner executable from controller_manager package ?
Thanks in advance for your answer.

A:

Have you tried using the --ros-args --log-level DEBUG when you start the Controller Manager node? If you are using a launch file, it would mean that you would need to add arguments=['--ros-args', '--log-level', 'DEBUG'] to the Controller Manager Node. This should enable the Controller Manager node to log in DEBUG mode.
