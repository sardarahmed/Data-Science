Q:

Publish JPEG Image from Drive

Hi guys, I have this python code that is able to save an image on my hardrive in JPEG format. The question I want to ask if any of you guys know how to publish this image as a sensor_msg/image in ROS.
Thanks

A:

Check out this tutorial: Writing a simple image publisher.
It provides an example of a minimal ros node which reads an image from file using cv::bridge and publishes it.
Note that the example uses the older, C-style OpenCV API. If you're interested in using the newer C++ API, but don't know how, comment here and I'll try to put together a code snippet.
