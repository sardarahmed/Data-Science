Q:

Control Multiple Universal Robotic arm in ros2

I am just wondering what is the best approach to control multiple universal  robotics arms from moveit and ros2. both robotic arms share their workspace so with collision avoidance.
If anyone had previous experience please share
Thank you

A:

There's a tutorial for that:  https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/examples/dual_arms/dual_arms_tutorial.html
One of the limitations of the tutorial setup is that motion planning & execution for the 2 arms will be synchronous. Basically, that's because the MoveGroupInterface is single-threaded.
They do share a planning scene so collision avoidance should work as you expect.

Thank you it is helpful. but if I want to control both arm simultaneously with different goals and with collision avoidance

You can do this, no problem:
I want to control both arm simultaneously with different goals and with collision avoidance

But not something like this:
Plan a motion for Arm 1
Begin executing for Arm 1
Plan a motion for Arm 2
Begin executing for Arm 2
Arm 1 motion completes
Arm 2 motion completes
