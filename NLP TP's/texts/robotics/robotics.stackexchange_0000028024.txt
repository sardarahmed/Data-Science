Q:

what is a joint and a link, and how does the child and parent parameter work in the joint?

I am working on modifying the PX4 gazebo simulator by adding a camera. I am unable to add the camera as the quadcopter take off but the camera get left behind. Can someone explain the difference and to connect them?
