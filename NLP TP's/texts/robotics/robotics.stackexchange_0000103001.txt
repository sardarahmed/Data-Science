Q:

Ros2 launch gives an error in ros2_control_demos

Hello
I am trying ros2_contro_demos.
Follow the tutorial,
git clone -b galactic https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control
git clone -b galactic https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers
git clone -b galactic https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control_demos

and
 rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
 colcon build --symlink-install

I have finished to build with some additional packages.
But, I hit
ros2 launch rrbot_description view_robot.launch.py

I get an error below
raise SubstitutionFailure("executable '{}' not found on the PATH".format(self.name))
launch.substitutions.substitution_failure.SubstitutionFailure: executable '[<launch.substitutions.text_substitution.TextSubstitution object at 0x7f72314f7eb0>]' not found on the PATH

I have no idea what error this is.
Please help me.
thanks.
My setup is below.
Ubuntu20.04
ros2:galactic

A:

I debugged the launch file and found that joint_state_publisher was the cause.
I don't know why, but uninstalling and reinstalling joint_state_publisher solved this problem.
thanks.

I still have the problem even if I uninstall and reinstall the joint_state_publisher. Could you please provide more detail about this problem and how did you debug launch file?
My setup is Ubuntu 20.04 ROS2 foxy

I am getting the same error while launching a launch file (unrelated to ros2_control). Could somebody fill me in as to why that is happening and how to solve it?
