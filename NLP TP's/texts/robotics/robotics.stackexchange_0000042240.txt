A:

There are various robot simulators, based on stage or gazebo.
EDIT: Most of the officially listed robots have some kind of simulation procedure. The quality and detail no doubt vary depending on the needs of those projects.

You should also consider using Morse (http://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse/).
