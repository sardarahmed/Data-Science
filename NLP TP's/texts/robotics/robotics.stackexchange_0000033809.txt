Q:

Error writing data to buffer: urdf model in rviz

I am trying to spawn a URDF model in RVIZ. However, rviz only displays the axes of each link and thus I cannot see the links. These links are build up from .stl files.
Furthermore I get the following error message in my terminal:
../../intel/intel_bufmgr_gem.c:1158: Error writing data to buffer 67: (0 135936) Bad address .
My computer is a Lenovo Thinkpad T510. It has an i5 processor and has an Integrated Graphics Controller. I am running ROS on Ubuntu 10.10
Thanks in advance

A:

It turned out that an update to Ubuntu 11.04 solved the problem. Probably my graphics drivers were outdated
