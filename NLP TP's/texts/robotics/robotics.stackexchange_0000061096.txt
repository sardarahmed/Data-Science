Q:

ar_track_alvar mistake on id

Dear Ros Users,
I'm experiencing problem on tag recognition using the ar_track_alvar package: "staring" at the same tag, the id of tag recognized is not stable (for example changing from id:32 to id:210 and back to id:32).
Does anyone have experienced the same problem? Furthermore, is there the option to delimit the tag recognizable?
Thank you!

The size of the tag and camera resolution matter.
I used tag in size of 4cm and the id recognition is terrible. I have tried Xtion and primesense Carmine and the resolution is not enough for such small tag. Right now I'm trying to calibrate my Kinect2 to do the job.

A:

Yes I had the same problem.
You can experiment with the max new marker error parameter. Maybe this helps.
