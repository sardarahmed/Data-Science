Q:

System dependencies have not been satisfied, apt python-mock, apt python-coverage

Hello,
I am new to ros. I am using rosbuild to compile gmapping package, https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping/tree/groovy-devel,it tells me many lines of "No Makefile in package...". Then I use rosdep check gmapping command , the terminal show me
"System dependencies have not been satisfied
apt   python-mock
apt   python-covergae"
What's more, my ros version is groovy, operation system is ubuntu 12.04.
What should I do next?
