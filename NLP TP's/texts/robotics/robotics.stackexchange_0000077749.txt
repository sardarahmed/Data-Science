Q:

No module named '_tf' error when doing "writing a tf broadcaster (py) tutorial

Hi all  Below is the error I'm getting when I try to launch the launch file using the command
roslaunch learning_tf start_demo.launch 
File "/home/cj/catkin_ws/src/learning_tf/nodes/turtle_tf_broadcaster.py", line 6, in  
import tf
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tf/__init__.py", line 28, in 

    from _tf import *
ImportError: No module named '_tf' 
I tried updating using pacman -Syu and tried reinstalling the "tf" package but the result is the same. 
I'm still a beginner and appreciate if someone can help me to correct this error.
PS.
I followed the steps given in this tutorial 
This error occurs when I try to do the roslaunch learning_tf start_demo.launch step.

A:

The problem is the leading underscore before tf in the import. Remove this and you should be good to go.
But updating/reinstalling tf will not change this. The problem is in the learning_tf repo.
Where did you get this demo from? Did you clone from github or did you copy'n'paste stuff or did you change anything?

If it is this demo, then I think it's a simple copy-paste error, as there is no underscore before tf in the example.

Thank you very much for your replays..
This is the tutorial part I was following .
The file in the  learning_tf repo contains the  import tf problem is with the init.py file..
Comment by Chamikajp on 2016-12-09:
It contains the   from _tf import *  .. I'll try editing the init.py file and get back to you..

But which "repo" are you talking about specifically?
Comment by Chamikajp on 2016-12-09:
Sorry if my comment is confusing. I meant the learning_tf folder which has the file containing the import tf code.. I exactly followed the steps given in the tutorial. Error is generated by this file /opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tf/init.py"
