Q:

colorize area of point cloud on a 2D image

I am projecting a 3D Point Cloud on a 2D image incoming as ROS 2 messages. Now, I want to fill the gaps between pixels from the point cloud, so that I can see an area, instead of single pixels and publish the overlay (point cloud + camera) image. I found here a similar question, but unfortunately it hasn't been answered.
What I am trying to achieve is:
before

after

I tried at first some voronoi diagram, but I haven't succeeded. My Node is written in C++ using OpenCV for image processing.
Does anyone has an idea, how can I achieve it?

A:

I managed to achieve better results with cv::dilate.
As far as I tested, I haven't lost any perfomance and it is really easy to implement.
