Q:

Using rostopic /image_raw for VideoCapture in OpenCV

Hello,
All of a sudden, I need to change my approach from calling TheVideoCapturer.open(0); (TheVideoCapturer is of a class VideoCapture) to open my internet camera (id 0) to subscribing to published image_raw topic. What are the easiest steps here? I'd like to use my TheVideoCapturer object still, because changing everything would be really troublesome.

A:

first you must change  your cv::mat image in to ros_image that's possible by cv_bridge and you can publish it.(for publishing you can use sensor_msgs::imageor image_transport)
