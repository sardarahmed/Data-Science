Q:

syntax of services

I am trying to use rosservice for gazebo but i can't find the right syntax to use. where can i find the syntax i should use.
i was trying to use set_joint_properties on my little urdf i wrote and it wasn't working do to wrong syntax.
what i am realy trying do to is to symulate in gazebo a inverted pendelum and leave it up by using control methods. i am not sure how to start, it looks as if there is a control loop that is leeving it standing in place, otherwise it should have fallen over.
can some one give me an idea haw should i start.
the urdf model--

Thanks
Nachum

Without more clarification on what you're trying to do (or what problems your encountered when you tried), all I can suggest is this wiki page
