Q:

Unable to understand the usage of std_msgs/Empty.h

Does anybody understand what does the '--once' mean in 'rostopic pub toggle_led std_msgs/Empty'?
What should command should I put in the terminal to toggle the led of my choice. In my opinion, I think that '--once' is the cause of my failure.
Hope you guys can help me to solve this issue. THANKS!

A:

Check out
rostopic pub -h

For an explanation of --once. It doesn't do what you think it does.
Then, you might want to read the wiki documentation on msg, since it seems like you don't understand how you can use them. It might also help you to review the publisher/subscriber tutorial.
As for your question: std_msgs/Empty is just that - a message without any associated data. If you want to select which LED to blink, you'll want another message type that includes at least one data field.
