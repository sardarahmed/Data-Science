A:

If you're running Ubuntu, and installed ROS with apt-get, the first step would be
sudo apt-get remove ros-*

If you've created a workspace, you'll have to also remove that... and if you added the setup scripts to your .bashrc, you'd have to remove them too.
If you've installed from source then it will be more complicated.

hello,
Actually I had both indigo and jade installed in my system. I tried to remove jade by sudo apt-get remove ros-jade  but it shows unable to locate package ros-jade. I want to remove only jade

Hai, I am completely new to ros and linux. Can you pls tell me how to remove added scripts from .bashrc. Also I believe that removing workspace simply means removing the folder. Kindly help

@newbieros did you try $ sudo apt-get remove ros-jade-* ? You have to add the asterisk in there.

@Kaustubh Patil - if you are on Ubuntu you have to remove the line from .bashrc:
Edit the file ./bashrc:
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
The remove the line that looks something like this: : source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

Note that this syntax does not work between apt versions 1.9.9 and 2.0.2: https://askubuntu.com/a/1218821
Instead, use sudo apt uninstall '?name(ros-*)'
