Q:

What method is commonly used in industral manipulators

Position control versus  torque control. What method is commonly used in industral manipulators

A:

In my experience, most pick and place robots use a version of position control, which they augment with feedforward dynamic models for improved speed and reduced errors.   Those robots which maintain contact with the environment (such as grinding, deburring, cutting, etc) usually implement a hybrid force/position control.
