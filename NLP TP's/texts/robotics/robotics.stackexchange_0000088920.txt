Q:

RVIZ- For frame [base_laser_link]: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist

I've been going through Laser Scan Data tutorial.
I ran the command $rosbag play Mapping1.bag. I could see the /base_scan among the rostopic list and echo it to the console. But I am unable to view it on rviz.
I ran $rosrun rviz rviz and added display /base_scan/LaserScan.
RVIZ is showing Global status warning Fixed Frame - No tf data.  Actual error: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist
and status error For frame [base_laser_link]: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist.
How can I fix this?

A:

The robot system has no transform data between the map frame and your robot frames. You would need some form of odometry or a transform publisher to see your laser scans in the map frame.
To find out which frame your scan is published in, have a look at the frame_id in your /base_scan message. The message is probably too long or fast to see the header data inside your terminal, so pipe it to less:
rostopic echo /base_scan | less
Based on your status error I'm guessing the frame_id is base_laser_link. To view your laser scan change the RViz Fixed Frame to  that (or any frame connected to it in the tf tree).
