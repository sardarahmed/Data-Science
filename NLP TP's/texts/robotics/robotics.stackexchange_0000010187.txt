Q:

Proper naming of PID regulators

I was wondering either there is any special naming for regulators that:

Outputs unit is the same as inputs, ie. velocity [m/s] as input and velocity as output [m/s].
Outputs unit is different than inputs, ie. position as input [m], velocity as output [/m/s]

I would appreciate all help.

A:

What exactly do you mean? The units at what point in the control loop? You can't exactly have a speed reference input to a PID controller and use a position feedback. 
Similarly, if you're just looking strictly at the inputs and outputs of the PID block itself, then the units are always different. That is, for a speed controller, you have:

(P)roportional gain output: [Speed ref] - [Speed fbk]  (Units of dist/time)
(I)ntegral gain output: [Pos ref] - [Pos fbk]  (Units of 
dist)
(D)erivative gain output: [Accel ref] - [Accel fbk]  (Units of dist/time^2)

So, where the input of a PID controller are a particular unit, the I/D aspects of the PID controller require the output units to always be different. This is typically just the "control signal" and inputs to whatever the plant is. 
Again I'll ask, what are the inputs and outputs you are considering? In and out of the PID block, or input/output as in the reference and feedback?
If you mean reference and feedback (inputs and outputs to the entire control system), then generally you have:

SISO - Single Input Single Output, meaning that there is one input and one output. These outputs should be the same units to make any sense. 
MIMO - Multiple Input Multiple Output, meaning that there are multiple inputs and multiple outputs. This is generally some state feedback or LQR controller, and here the units can be mixed as you're trying to control the system instead of a particular parameter. 

Consider any scenario when you might want to try using a feedback in units other than the reference units. What then are you trying to do? For instance, why would you want to use acceleration as a feedback for a speed reference? Maybe you want to control min/max acceleration while you try to achieve a particular speed, or you want to control speed while you try to achieve a particular position, but I'll point out that in these scenarios you are trying to control two parameters (speed and position, speed and acceleration, etc.), and thus it's a MIMO system (Multiple input - speed ref and [X] limits, multiple output - speed and [X]).
