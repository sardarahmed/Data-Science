Q:

moveit joint with more than 2pi rotation

hey,
i was wondering if im doing something wrong or if moveit cant handle revolute joints which surpass -2pi/2pi. im extending an ur5 with a contiunous joint and moveit automatically limits it to -pi/pi. However if i declare the joint as revolute with some generous limits like -10pi/10pi the planning fails or gives terrible results. Is there any way to fix this problem?
thanks

A:

It can handle continuous or less-limited revolute joints but.
Continuous joints are handled differently from limited joints.
Solutions are always given in [-pi;pi] but can wrap around when needed.
For execution the generated trajectories can actually unwind and give
waypoints outside [-pi;pi].
If you encounter a specific problem here please report it in the github
repository.
Simulating continuous joints by larger rotation limits is a bad idea.
The biggest problem is that you increase the search space tremendously which is probably why planning times out.

Do you know if the 'unwind' feature is implemented in the compute_cartesian_path method? Moveit seems to be ignoring waypoints following a -pi to pi (or vice versa) wrap-around in any of the robot joints.

Hello,
i have a simular problem. I am working with a KUKA robot which has joint limits of +/-190 degrees. If the robot moves to a position where the limits overlap, it gets trapped there.
Is there a posibility to use revolute joints with limits over +/-pi?
Thanks
