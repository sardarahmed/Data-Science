Q:

ROS with public Wifi

Hello everyone,
I want to use ROS to comunicate Simulink and three drones Crazyflie. I have some problems using ROS with the public wifi of the University, when I type rosinit the error is:
Cannot connect to ROS master at http://172.30.152.10:11311. Check the specified address or hostname.
I tried also to run the command at home with the provate wifi and there it works perfectly, what are the reasons and how can I solve it? I need to use ROS at University.
Thank you for your answers.

Just a guess, but there's probably some rules with your university's firewall that IT implemented that's giving you trouble. You'll probably have to talk to your university's IT department or use your own WLAN (I've encountered the same issue at a university).

Thank you for the fast answer, and do you think that if I use my macbook as a personal hotspot could it work?

Not sure, I don't use Macs. You can use a wireless router, however.

I found a solution: sharing the connection of an Android mobile phone connected to the public Wifi to my computer, and it works !!! :D
