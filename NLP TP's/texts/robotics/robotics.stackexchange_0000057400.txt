Q:

how do I test code agenst `catkin install`-ed directory

As far as I understand correctly catkin_make test uses code under devel directory, is there way to test code for install directory?

Can you clarify a little bit?  There's no catkin_test command.

sorry, I asked about catkin_make test against installed program

A:

All tests are only run against the devel space. So you can not run the unit tests of a specific package against the installed version of the same package.
What you can do is run the tests of a package foo against the installed version of all dependencies. Therefore you first build and install all dependencies using one workspace and then use a second workspace containing foo and run its tests. Usually those kind of tests are not unit tests but integration tests - you might consider to bundle integration tests into separate packages (which you could ignore when releasing a repo) for this purpose.
