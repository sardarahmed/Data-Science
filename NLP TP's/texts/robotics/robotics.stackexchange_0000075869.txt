Hello,
I also have the same issue but I am unable to change the source code since the topic is coming from an android app (https://aapks.com/apk/ros-android-sensors-driver/). Source code should be fro here: https://github.com/rpng/android_sensors_driver and might even be fixed (imu frame_id is published as "/imu") but I don't have the toolchain to recompile.
Thanks

A:

What if you remove the '/' in your source code? Sometimes ROS will add a '/' for you, so if you give '/kitti_player', things will go wrong. So just give 'kitti_player' in your code.
