Q:

Casting shadows on textured meshes

Using gazebo 1.3.1, objects do not cast shadows on textured objects.
How to reproduce: start an empty world, add a coke can and a cube. The can casts shadows on the cube (and the ground), but the cube does not shadow the can (it shadows only the ground).
Importance: I would like to use a texturized terrain with shadows on the ground.

A:

With the current version of Gazebo and the version of  Ogre in Ubuntu, shadows will be cast on textured objects as long as the texture is not tiled.
This will be fixed in the next version of Ogre.
