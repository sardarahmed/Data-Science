Q:

idea for web application in robotics

I am learning and I am interested robotics, but also I need to update my web development skills so the question is - is there any idea for good web application that could be connected with robotics - service robots, industrial robots etc. Maybe there already is some open source ongoing web application projects for robotics in which I can make contribution.
Thanks!

A:

web based robotic simulator will be a good project. You can do simulators like gazebo and morse
