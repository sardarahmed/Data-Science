Q:

Keyword searches broken on wiki.ros.org?

Hello,
It appears that keyword searches on wiki.ros.org are somewhat broken.  For example, if I search for ar_kinect which is an existing package with its own wiki page, I get no results.
If I search for arduino, the ros_arduino_bridge package does not show up in the results and if I search directly for ros_arduino_bridge, I get only one hit to the geometry wiki page which doesn't even make sense as ros_arduino_bridge does not depend directly on this package.
Some searches work OK but there are many like the ones above.
Thanks,
patrick

@Dirk Thomas any ideas?

A:

Since the moinmoin wiki has exceed its "recommended" page limit by far the search is not using the moinmoin specific search at all. Instead it used Google search. So there is no "keyword" search but just "plain text" search.
I don't know why the previously integrated Google search was so bad but I guess it was not updated correctly during the transition to the new hosting. Anyway a normal google search seems to bring up the expected results (e.g. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ar_kinect+site%3Awiki.ros.org).
I created a new Google custom search profile. Now the results of the search should be more appealing.
