A:

The ROS package is called depthimage_to_laserscan, but the debian package is called ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan. The underscores (_) in the ROS package name are converted to dashes (-), as per Debian package naming guidelines.

Edit:

E: Could not find package ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan

Looking at ros_kinetic_default.html?q=depthimage, it would seem the package has been released into Kinetic, but that the package hasn't been synced (copied) to the public package repositories. If you can wait a while, just wait: @tfoote will do a sync sometime in the coming weeks, which will make the package apt-getable.
If you can't wait, you have two options:

build from source: clone the ros-perception/depthimage_to_laserscan git repository, run a rosdep install .. step, then build your workspace
use the wiki/ShadowRepository package repository. That repository will contain the version of the package that has been staged for the next sync (option 1). Understand though that using the shadow repository is considered 'advanced'.
