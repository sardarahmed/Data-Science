Q:

Trouble launching moveit2 configurations

Hi I am using ROS2 humble with moveit2. I created a configuration with setup_assistant of moveit2. However, when I try to launch the demo launch file created by it. It gaves me the error:
[ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): 'capabilities'
I could not find anything related to capabilities. What does it mean? May someone please help me?

A:

I found the solution thanks to @ssarkar. What you should do to fix this error is first you need to open the file called launches.py and go to line 203. To simply do it run the ros2 launch command with --debug.
After opening it you need to reverse commit the changes mentioned here. What I mean is copy,
ld.add_action(DeclareLaunchArgument("capabilities", default_value=""))

and then paste it instead of
ld.add_action(
    DeclareLaunchArgument(
        "capabilities",
        default_value=moveit_config.move_group_capabilities["capabilities"],
    )
)

After that save the file with ctrl+s and then rebuild you colcon space. Done.
