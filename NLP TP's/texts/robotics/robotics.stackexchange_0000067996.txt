What is the web page of the ros driver for that camera?

not sure if you meant this but here is the drivers git: https://github.com/ros-drivers/camera1394

A:

All the parameters from http://wiki.ros.org/camera1394 7.1 could be set in a yaml that is loaded like <rosparam command="load" file="$(find rosparam)/example.yaml" /> within a launch file that launches the camera1394 node (and put the rosparam load inside the private namespace of the camera node).  http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/rosparam
