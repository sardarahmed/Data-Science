Q:

Broken dependencies in Fuerte

Hi!
I installed ros-fuerte-desktop-full beta yesterday using this manual. I'm using Ubuntu 11.10. Everything seems to be good, but when I try to compile my old project, I receive next messages.
manifest.xml contains next:
<package>
  <description brief="RobotVision">

     RobotVision

  </description>
  <author>crady</author>
  <license>BSD</license>
  <review status="unreviewed" notes=""/>
  <url>http://ros.org/wiki/RobotVision</url>
  <depend package="pcl"/>
  <depend package="pcl_ros"/>
  <depend package="roscpp"/>
  <depend package="sensor_msgs"/>
  <depend package="vosch"/>
</package>

What is wrong? I'm missing something? Project created and works on electric.

What is your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and other ROS environment settings?  'env | grep ROS'

Please answer Tully's question about ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
Comment by CaptainTrunky on 2012-04-05:
$ env | grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/crady/ros:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/common-lisp/ros
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_DISTRO=fuerte
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/fuerte/etc/ros

Did appending ":/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros" to the end of your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH work?
Comment by CaptainTrunky on 2012-04-07:
Seems that this helps. Now it complains on really missing package, not "virtually". Thanks a lot!

A:

Looks like you need the PCL library itself, now separately installed:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-pcl

You can use the new rosdep script to make sure you install everything:
$ rosdep install RobotVision

UPDATE: my $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH contains all this:
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros

I received next
rosdep install RobotVision
All required rosdeps installed successfully
and from apt-get install
ros-fuerte-pcl is already the newest version.
ros-fuerte-pcl set to manually installed.
Everything seems to be good, but does not compile.

That sounds like a new question. Please ask it separately with error messages, etc.
Comment by CaptainTrunky on 2012-04-05:
I didn't understand you, what about question?
rosdep and apt-get install works fine, they say that all dependencies for my project (like pcl) already installed (and it's true - I can see libs and headers in /opt/fuerte). But I still have error with them from my first post.
