Q:

Opening a bag file with rqt_bag from the command line?

With rxbag I could do "rxbag bagfile". How do I do the same with rqt_bag? It is very inconvenient to use open and the graphical file browser to open a bag file.

A:

Currently it is not possible but it is trivial to implement. I filled a feature request at https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_common_plugins/issues/10 - it should be available in the next patch release of rqt_bag.
Update: the changes have been committed to rqt_common_plugins and will be available with the next version 0.2.8.
