Q:

Configuring turtlebot3_slam_gmapping

Is there a way to unsubscribing the turtlebot3_slam_gmapping node from the topic /scan and in place of that, subscribing turtlebot3_slamp_gmapping  to a topic published by /scan_to_scan_filter_chain ? To elaborate, I want SLAM node to get filtered information from the node scan_to_scan_filter_chain rather than the original information from the /turtlebot_lds.

Are you asking about changing the topic that gmapping publishes to?

@jayess nope, I'm just asking about changing the topic of subscription for turtlebot3_slam_gmapping from turtlebot3_lds to scan_to_scan_filter_chain.

A:

You're looking for the <remap> tag then. roslaunch allows you to change a node's topics during launch time with it. so, you'd have something like
<remap from="scan" to="new_scan_topic"/>

According to the documentation on the wiki

The <remap> tag applies to all subsequent declarations in its scope (<launch>, <node> or <group>).
