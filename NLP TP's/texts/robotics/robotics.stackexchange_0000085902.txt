Q:

Cannot include header from another package

I have a package my_lib, that contains Parameters.h in he include folder, which I need to include in another package my_main. I am following this answer to do so:
https://answers.ros.org/question/201977/include-header-file-from-another-package-indigo/
But I get
fatal error: my_lib/Parameters.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated.

when I run catkin_make.
I can see Parameters.h appear successfully in catkin_ws/install/include/my_lib after I ran catkin_make install.
In my_main package i did the following:
package.xml: added
<build_depend>my_lib</build_depend>
<exec_depend>my_lib</exec_depend>

CMakeLists.txt:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  ...(other packages used in my_main)  
  my_lib )
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system) 
catkin_package(INCLUDE_DIRS include
  LIBRARIES my_main 
  CATKIN_DEPENDS ...(other packages used in my_main) my_lib
  DEPENDS system_lib)
include_directories(   include  
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}  
  ${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS} )
  add_executable(my_main_node src/my_main_node.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_main_node   ${catkin_LIBRARIES} )
install(DIRECTORY
  include/${PROJECT_NAME}/   DESTINATION
  ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION} 
  FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h"   PATTERN
  ".svn" EXCLUDE )

What am I missing?

Is there a difference between "my_lib" and the my2_lib that appears in your CMakeLists.txt?

No, that was just a typo during copying and renaming, it is all the same node. Sorry about that. Edited the post.

A:

You should make sure of the following:

The CMakeLists.txt of the my_lib package has catkin_package(INCLUDE_DIRS include...), include_directories(include...), and the install(...) function call inside
Parameters.h is in <workspace>/src/my_lib/include/my_lib/. Notice the two occurrences of "my_lib"
Relevant files in the my_main package have the correct include statement #include "my_lib/Parameters.h"
