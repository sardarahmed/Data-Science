Q:

Translate velocity from encoder count per second to meters per second

I am working with a two wheeled robot, and I need the velocity of the wheels in meters per second, I have the encoder count per second, the wheel radius and the wheel distance. How can I translate this to meters per second?

This really isn't a ROS question ... but, for a hint, you'll also need to know how many encoder counts per wheel revolution.

A:

wheel velocity = wheel rotation(rad/s) * wheel radius(m)
