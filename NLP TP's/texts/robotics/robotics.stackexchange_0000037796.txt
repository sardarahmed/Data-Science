Q:

missing link between urdf and rosserial

Hi, I have an arexx robot arm: http://www.arexx.com/robot_arm/
Following a tutorial, I created an urdf file for my robot arm.
Then I followed the tutorial for the "Planning Description Configuration Wizard". It does the path planning and IK in the simulator nicely.
On the other hand, I followed the rosserial Arduino stuff to make the hardware interface. But I'm missing the link between the two.
My code so far is in : https://github.com/ulrichard/robotloader/tree/master/ros
What is the usual practice to connect from the urdf to the physical robot using rosserial?

A:

When using a URDF you will need to publish joint states from the hardware(aka that's what needs to come from your rosserial devices. And then a tool like robot_state_publisher can help to make it work with the URDF.

If you just have open loop there's not need to send data through the rosserial process.  Just estimate the movement and publish in a simple node based on the commands.
