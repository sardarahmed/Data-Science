Q:

Is pr2_kinect_empty_world.launch contain openni_node.launch?

I followed recognition kitchen--ROS Quick Guide.
It says I need to run:
  roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch

But I want to run object_recognition package in gazebo.
So I found that the pr2_kinect_empty_world.launch file:
  roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_kinect_empty_world.launch 

Is pr2_kinect_empty_world.launch contain all the same functionalities of openni_node.launch?
If no, how to simulate the kinect which can be used in package which needs to run openni_node.launch?
Thank you~

A:

there is a openni plugin that pr2 simulation uses to generate topics published by the kinect; it's mostly there, but there are some issues that need to be sorted out.
