A:

There is very simple demo of something like that, the code is a bit old and might need a few updates, but it is posted here: https://github.com/mikeferguson/maxwell/blob/sixdof/maxwell_navigation/nodes/goto.py
You'll notice that the goals are hard coded (the easiest way to do this is to use rostopic echo on the move_base goal topic, and click on your "goals" in rviz), basically, I have a name for each pose (was basically the center of the office). Video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aABif3W6MY
UPDATE: As for implementing this on TurtleBot, if you have navigation (http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_navigation) running, you will need to fire up pocketsphinx with your dictionary of words (see the docs for the node http://ros.org/wiki/pocketsphinx) and make that goto.py script have the proper names and places.

@DCD - Ferg's code publishes the standard move base simple goal, so any robot running the navigation stack should respond to it. You'll also need to be running the pocketsphinx recognizer too. https://github.com/mikeferguson/maxwell/blob/sixdof/maxwell_navigation/launch/goto.launch
