Q:

Adding White Noise to a camera

Hello,
I need to do a grid shearch to caracherize the error of the camera I'm working with in gazebo.
For that I need to add white noise to the camera.
In the URDF I see that Gazebo already does that.
    <noise>
      <type>gaussian</type>
      <!-- Noise is sampled independently per pixel on each frame.
           That pixel's noise value is added to each of its color
           channels, which at that point lie in the range [0,1]. -->
      <mean>0.0</mean>
      <stddev>0.007</stddev>
    </noise>

Are there any instructions or something I can read to know more about how I should tune this 2 parameters? Any examples/tutorials here is Gazebo?
I hope Gazebo doesn't use just rand() function to generate this white noise. It doesn't right?
The ideia I have is to leave the mean at zero and just increase the stddev, but to what number?
Thx for help.

A:

I'm guessing trial and error will be your friend.
I'm currently using mean = 0.0 and stddev = 0.1
If you run the simulation and press 'ctrl' and 't' it brings up a Gazebo Topic Selector.
Accessing the 'gazebo.msgs.ImageStamped'  option lets you see the camera sensor image with noise.
you can adjust your stddev to suit.
hope this helps
