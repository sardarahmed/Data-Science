Q:

Using saved map and control the robot with using Python

Hello. I'm beginner at  using ROS and SLAM algorithm. I would like to ask a question about controling system. I just followed the TF trainings and  mapping navigation on turtle, I can navigate the robot however, what kind of steps should I use to make my mapping and navigation. For example:

Do mapping.
Then do something etc.
Do location

like that.
So I think, I need a launch file for the launch the robot. But how can I use my mapping on that system? I looked at the some tutorials but I could'nt understand.
Have a nice day!
