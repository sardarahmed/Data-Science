Q:

Gazebo Spawns My Model Really, Really Far Away

Hello all,
I am trying to spawn my robots urdf model in gazebo using
rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file H20_urdf.urdf -urdf -model Robot -z 0.5

But it spawns my robot way out in the middle of no where, here is an image of where it is in gazebo.
My console output says that it spawn successfully, but the robot has spawned on its side and not 0.5m above the origin.
[INFO] [WallTime: 1358537000.298533] [0.000000] waiting for service /gazebo/spawn_urdf_model
spawn status:  SpawnModel: successfully spawned model
root@ubuntu:~/ros_workspace/learning_urdf# 

Does anyone know why gazebo is spawning my object incorrectly?
Regards,
Martin

A:

Hello,
I think the problem is that the robot intersects with the floor, try increasing the value of z!
