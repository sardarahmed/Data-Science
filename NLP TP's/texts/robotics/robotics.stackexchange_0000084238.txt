Q:

How to move specific joint only using MoveIt?

I'm using MoveIt interface to control my Yumi Robot either by setting  the joints value or the Pose values. What I need to do is changing the value of one joint only (joint-6) without changing the other joint values.
Thank you in advance.

A:

I just solved it by some coding I get the current state of joints and copy them to a variable, and then just edit the needed joint only.
here is the code
std::vector<double> x;
group.getCurrentState() ->copyJointGroupPositions(group.getCurrentState() ->getRobotModel() ->getJointModelGroup(group.getName()), x);
x[/joint number/]=/value/;

The code is available in ROS book chapter 6
