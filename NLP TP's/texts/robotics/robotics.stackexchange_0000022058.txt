Question about robot jacobian

I try to understand jacobian for robot control. I want to precisely understand how to build that matrix.
Can someone advice me course which explain how to create that matrix on a simple sample?
An other question about that matrix, I read that this matrix had to be process every step. Is it true?

A:

Jacobian matrix is used to describe the relationship between the configuration space (space of joint angles) and the task space (space of end-effector pose)
as follows:
$\textbf{$\dot{p}$} = \textbf{J(q)}\textbf{$\dot{q}$}$,
where $\textbf{J(q)}$ is the Jacobian matrix, $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{q}$ are vectors represented for the end-effector pose and joint angles, respectively.
