Q:

ROS Intel Realsense how to process data with PCL

Hello,
Currently i a trying to detect object using a Intel realsense D415 camera.
I got the camera running and it can publish /camera/depth/color/points.
My question is how to process this data to detect the object?
I understand that it possible to use PCL to process point cloud data and i think it may by possible to used it for my application.
However i have no idea how to use PCL or how to use PCL with ROS.
Any tips, advises, examples or suggestions are welcome.
I run the system on on a ubuntu 16.04 LTS and ROS kinetic.
The package i got working are the realsens2_camera and pcl_ros.

Hello everyone,
I found a way to process the Intel Realsense data with PCL.
First made a subscriber for the /camera/depth/color/points.
I translate the sensor_msgs::Pointcloud2  to pcl::PCLPointCloud2::Ptr.
Than i uses the PCL functions to process the point cloud and at the end i translate it back to sensor_msgs::Pointcloud2, so i can publish it and see it with RVIZ.
