Q:

Can too much input current destroy my motor driver?

I have a 18 V rated driver I'm using to drive two 12 V DC gear motors using my Arduino. I bought a new battery pack which is rated 3300 mAh 25C, 11.1V making the total current input 82.5 A. My driver is rated for 7 V min and 18 V max, no current rating is given.
My motors are 12V max current under load is 9.5 A.
So just to be sure, can using this battery destroy my motor driver?
This is the datasheet.

A:

You are approaching the problem from wrong side. Current capability of a battery (25C) has nothing to do with that how much current will it actually source. It is the load (motors in that case) what defines the current, not the battery. You could use 10C, 25C, 50C battery, and the current flowing through the motors would be (approximately) the same, as long as it does not exceed the maximum current allowed for the battery (82 Amps in your case)
As a side note - I find it hard to believe, that there is no maximum current defined in the motor driver datasheet. It is the key information. Please post te link to the datasheet, or just a part number.
