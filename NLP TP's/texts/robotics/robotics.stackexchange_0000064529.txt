Q:

Simulation of mobile base in gazebo is not visualizing in rviz

Hi,
I loaded a mobile base with differential drive in gazebo and I am able to control it in teleop mode. I tried to connect visualization to rviz. The robot is loaded fine in rviz . Wheels are rotating , but robot is not moving. Can any explain the reason?

A:

The rviz Global Options | Fixed Frame is set to base_link or the equivalent for your robot?  If you set it to map and then don't see the robot properly then there needs to be something that publishes a transform between map and base_link.
You can 'cheat' and get the position from /gazebo/model_states and then publish it as a transform.  The more realistic thing to do is implement odometry and have that publish the transform from there, though it will deviate from gazebo absolute position after a while (just as it would in real life).

I used differential drive plugin of gazebo.Inside that,there  is odometry tag which publishes odom and it is publishing also.That odom topic can be selected from rviz without any errors. But it is not updating.

There is a package called gazebo2rviz. May be helpful to you.
