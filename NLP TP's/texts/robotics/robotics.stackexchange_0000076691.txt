Q:

Unable to start robot state publisher due to missing library

When I try to launch robot_state_publisher with the launch file:
<launch>
    <arg name="model" default="$(find mybot_description)/urdf/mybot.urdf.xacro"/>
    <param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro --inorder $(arg model)" />
    <node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher" />
</launch>

it dies with the error:
/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/robot_state_publisher/state_publisher: error while loading shared libraries: librobot_state_publisher_solver.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Obviously, I have the ros-kinetc-robot-state-publisher package installed. Why is it throwing this error? Searching apt-cache finds nothing providing that .so file.

A:

I confirmed the .so file is located in /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/librobot_state_publisher_solver.so. The problem was I was running roslaunch from the wrong directory, and I hadn't sourced my shell with the appropriate ROS environment variables.
