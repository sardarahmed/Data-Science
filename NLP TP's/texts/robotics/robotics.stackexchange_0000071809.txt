Q:

Tests if ros master is not running using rostest

I like to write a test for a feature that detects if ros master is not running. Using rostest, which automatically starts ros master, is there a way to achieve this?

A:

I think you've answered your own question: since rostest starts a master, you won't be able to use it for tests where a master isn't running.
Why not use a standard test framework such as gtest or nosetest for your tests which don't require a ROS master to be running?

Looking at a catkin's document, using non-ROS test structures sound like a right path.

Nosetest is the framework for running Python unit tests. No ROS environment is available. See: Configuring rostest if your tests need a running roscore.
