Q:

Are there any other signal interrupts with roscpp besides the default ctrl+c sigint handler

I have a ROS server that uses TCP/IP to communicate data.  While the server is listening for connections, the program is in somewhat of a sleep mode and so I cannot use the ros::ok command to check if the process has been killed. Are there are any other signal interrupts that come with roscpp that can deal with this?
Thanks.

Can you explain your use case a little more fully as to why ros::ok() does not work in your use case?

A:

There can be only one handler for any given signal at a time.  ROS does install a handler for SIGINT.   It is not possible to catch and handle SIGKILL.
