Q:

Unable to install package image_transport while installing ardrone_autonomy

While running rosmake command inside ardrone_autonomy repository I am getting this error:
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
[rosbuild] Building package ardrone_autonomy
Failed to invoke /opt/ros/kinetic/bin/rospack deps-manifests ardrone_autonomy
[rospack] Error: package 'ardrone_autonomy' depends on non-existent package 'image_transport' and rosdep claims that 
it is not a system dependency. Check the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or try calling 'rosdep update'

CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:129 (message):

Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package
'ardrone_autonomy'.  Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.
Please fix the broken dependency!

A:

The problem is most likely due to you using rosmake, as per the ardrone_autonomy documentation, you should install it using catkin_make:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy.git -b indigo-devel
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i
$ catkin_make
