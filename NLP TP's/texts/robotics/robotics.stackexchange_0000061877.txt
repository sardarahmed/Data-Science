Q:

Matlab Ros Extract Point Cloud 2 BLOB

I'm using Matlab with ROS support, and I'm successfully reading PointCloud2 data from a Kinect. How can I extract the x,y,z,rgb data from the BLOB structure contained in the sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 message?

A:

The message contents are binary encoded, so Matlab doesn't know how to extract the data.
If you want to implement it yourself, you can take a look at how ROS does it in the read and write functions:
https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/blob/indigo-devel/pcl_ros/include/pcl_ros/point_cloud.h
http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html
In the short term, it may be a lot easier for you to work with the depth image instead, as Matlab has all sorts of image processing/decoding functions.
