Q:

Defining material scripts in gazebo 1.9

Hi,
I'm trying to load my gazebo material scripts in gazebo 1.9 together with the gazebo_ros bridge. I'm not sure what is the right way to extend the resource_path. The export gazebo_media_path statements in the package.xml files don't seem to work. When manually creating the GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH variable the setup.sh file of the gazebo installation overwrites the environment variable I set. Copying the material scripts manually to /usr/share/gazebo1-9/... works fine, but this is only a hack.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Alex

A:

Thanks for your answer. I fixed it now for my installation. I did the following 2 mistakes:
1.) I used  <gazebo gazebo_media_path .../> instead of  <gazebo_ros gazebo_media_path .../> in my package.xml
2.) You have to define a <run_depend>gazebo_ros</run_depend> to get the export statement working.
The GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH unfortunally cannot be set manually because the script /usr/share/gazebo-1.9/setup.sh overwrites the variable.
