Q:

Dockerfile for building ROS from source

I'm trying to put together a Dockerfilethat builds ROS Indigo (just ros_comm for now) from source. I'm more or less following the wiki page instructions: Installing from source
I'm running into multiple issues (e.g. running rosdep update without sudo) Before I start bombarding you with those (and posting code snippets), I thought I'd ask if someone already knows of a Dockerfile that does that. Please keep in mind that the emphasis is on building from source.
Some things I've found so far:

https://github.com/osblinnikov/ros-docker (trick for running rosdep update without sudo)
https://github.com/ruffsl/ubuntu-docker (looks useful, but not sure if it helps me)
https://github.com/PabloGN/Docker-raspbian-ros-indigo (useful because my end goal is to make this an ARMhf image)

A:

I was finally able to put this Dockerfile together: ubuntu-ros-source It builds and installs ROS Indigo (ros_comm) from source on top of an Ubuntu Trusty image. The bootstrap tools are installed via pip
Adding it as an answer for future reference. Any feedback is highly welcome.
PS. I also ended up writing these as well:

resin-ros
resin-raspbian-ros-indigo-qemu
