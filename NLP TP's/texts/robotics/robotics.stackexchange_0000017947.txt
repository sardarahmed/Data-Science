Q:

Swarm Robot Simulation

Both V-rep and Webots simulator says that they can simulate multiple robots. Is these simulators are capable for simulate swarm robots? Can I simulate the swarm intelligence algorithms like ACO, BeeClust algorithm, Stick pulling Algorithm, Occlusion Based Collective pushing etc. on these simulators? Which robot I have to select for implementing above algorithms? For implementing these algorithms which simulator will be better? Any suggestions is appreciated.

A:

It's important to separate between simulation and artificial intelligence. An environment for simulating hundreds of robots on the screen is called a game engine. It can be realized with standard programming languages for example Python/pygame. The user creates an array of objects and each objects has a position and a speed value. The graphics engine displays all the objects on the screen. This is called a realtime simulation.
The other part is the artificial intelligence to control the objects. Without an AI, the robots in the simulation has to be controlled manually or by a random generator. They are displayed at the screen with smoothly 60 frames per second, but it's unknown how to move them right so that robots are solving a task. In general, a simulator for displaying hundreds of objects is easy to realize. The more advanced part is to create the AI which drives the objects autonomously.
Simulators like Webots, V-Rep, Gazebo, pygame or Unity3D are the environment in which a robotics controller is developed. They are providing the graphics and the underlying physics engine. They are working as a game construction set in which the user can script a game.
