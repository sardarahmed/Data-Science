Q:

Multiple node-ID assignation

I'm a neophyte of ROS programming: i need to use the same ROS-node for multiple independent agents; in other words i want to automatically replicate a node (during the launching), each one with its own ID.
In addition i'd like to use this ID in each node in such a way that i can define a topic for each agent (node) using a string and an integer (ID) variable.
can someone help me?
thanks

A:

You can set the node name as a parameter when you run it. And you can use a local topic name, which will be relative to the node name.
