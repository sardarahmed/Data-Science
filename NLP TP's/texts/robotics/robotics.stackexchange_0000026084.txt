Q:

Simulation of a PR2 mobile robot

Hi everybody,
I  am trying to run a simulation of a PR2 mobile robot inside a building using Gazebo 1.4 running under Ubuntu 12.04.
First of all, I would like to ask you if it exists a world constructor like Gzbuilder 3D, as this is obsolete. As I have not found it until now, I have started to build it with gazebo’s builder, but I have noticed that when two walls join at an angle different from 0 or 180 degrees, the corners protrude. That is, they don’t align properly. Is there any easy way to fix it? Could this affect in any way to PR2 simulated sensors?
Thank you in advance!

if you mean the building editor, the corners are currently as they are now, the edges are not smoothed or rounded. As for effect on PR2 simulated sensors, it depends on what you want to do and what sensor you use

A:

gzbuilder is very much an outdated. It has not been distributed with Gazebo for many years, and should be considered dead.
With Gazebo 1.5, you can create terrains using greyscale images. Take a look at worlds/heightmap.world for an example.
