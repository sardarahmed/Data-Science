Hi all,
Is someone already using rosjava on Fuerte? How can I install these packages like rosjava_bootstrap,.etc.
Thanks in advance.

A:

I am currently using rosjava and rosjava.android on a 12.04 install, the documentation can be found at
Rosjava Install Documentation
That should walk you through the install process for everything, as well as get you started.

Hey...thanks. I have yesterday tried it from link http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/installing.html but it gives "ERROR: Ambiguous workspace: ROS_WORKSPACE=/home/safdar/rosrescue, /home/safdar/my_workspace/.rosinstall". Did you alsoinstall rosjava on Fuerte on ubuntu 12.04???

Hi joy! I have solved Ambigugous problem. I seemed to me that all steps are gone correctly. Now when I rosmake a rosjava based package then I get error [AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'rosenv'] , Do you know why do I get this error?

rosjava does not support rosmake. I suggest going back to the documentation and making sure you can build and run the pubsub tutorial.

I get ERROR:Unzipping /home/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-1.0-milestone-9-bin/7ilkmgo2rn79vvfvd51rqf17ks/gradle-1.0-milestone-9-bin.zip to /home/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-1.0-milestone-9-bin/7ilkmgo2rn79vvfvd51rqf17ks

I imagine you have a corrupt download. Delete the zip file and try again.

its fine now. But if I run ../gradlew installApp from rosjava_tutorial_pubsub it builds successfully but I dont see any bin directory. if I run ./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker then it gives error Data not found. how can I run Talker?
