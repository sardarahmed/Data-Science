Q:

basic question to make a code with OMPL

I read how to write a new global planner on this web.( http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Writing%20A%20Global%20Path%20Planner%20As%20Plugin%20in%20ROS ).
and asked a question about how to implement OMPL. In the question, I said that OMPL is standalone. but, I don't make sense of standalone. I begin to write a code. Could anyone tell me if my description in ompl_planner_rrt.h is correct?
Thank you in advance!
ompl_planner_rrt.h

#ifndef OMPL_PLANNER_RRT_H_
#define OMPL_PLANNER_RRT_H_
#include &ltros/ros.h>
#include &ltcostmap_2d/costmap_2d_ros.h>
#include &ltcostmap_2d/costmap_2d.h>
#include &ltnav_core/base_global_planner.h>
#include &ltgeometry_msgs/PoseStamped.h>
#include &ltangles/angles.h>
#include &lttf/tf.h>
#include &lttf/transform_datatypes.h>
#include &ltbase_local_planner/world_model.h>
#include &ltbase_local_planner/costmap_model.h>
#include &ltompl/geometric/planners/rrt/RRT.h>

ompl_planner_rrt.cpp

#include &ltompl_planner_rrt/ompl_planner_rrt.h>
#include &ltpluginlib/class_list_macros.h>

I should post this question on OMPL Mailing List?

Above files are based on carrot_planner.cpp *.h. here I change namespace of carrot_planner to one of ompl_planner_rrt and I quoted CMakeLists.txt and package.xml in Problem with new BaseGlobalPlanner plugin. After catkin_make, it created libompl_planner_rrt.so. I don't use a function of ompl.

It might be important for me to look through sample code of OMPL.
Comment by Ken_in_JAPAN on 2014-06-05:
I should edit  only makePlan in ompl_planner_rrt.cpp with ob = ompl;;base and og = ompl::geometric?

A:

Standalone means I can insert ompl/geometric/planners/rrt/RRT.h in ompl_planner_rrt.cpp and *.h and use function by calling OMPL.
