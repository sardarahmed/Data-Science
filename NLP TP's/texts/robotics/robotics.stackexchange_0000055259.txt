Q:

unable to install naoqi

I am following the beginner tutorial
--Getting start with ROS for the Nao, including NAOqi and rviz.
I was unable to download the 1.14.3 sdk from the aldebaran website so i did it from some other site. When i am trying to run naoqi and executing this command:
$ ~/naoqi/naoqi-sdk-1.12.3-linux32/naoqi
I get an error saying no such file or directory. WHen I cehck the home folder, the file is there in the folder. How do I proceed? How do I install naoqi?

where did you find the SDK?

A:

Best request support from Aldebaran, they supply the NaoQI SDK. This has nothing to do with ROS, so the question is not really suited for this site.
