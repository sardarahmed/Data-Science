Q:

Reverse lift mechanism

I have made a RC robot from a wheelchair and I'm planning to attach a snow plow. I'm wondering if there is any mechanism that would be able to lift the plow when reversing. 
I have only 2 channel transmitter so I can't control the plow's movement through it so I was thinking of some mechanical lift that triggers when reversing.
Do you guys know about something I could use for it?
Thanks.

A:

I assume that your 2 channels control forward/backward and left/right.  But even if the 2 channels control forward/backward in each wheel (differential-drive style), it should still be possible to do what you are suggesting electrically instead of mechanically.  
You should be able to read the input signal to the motors, decide whether those signals are commanding a "reverse" movement, and trigger your snow plow lift motor accordingly.
