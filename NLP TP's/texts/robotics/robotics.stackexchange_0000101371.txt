Q:

Behavior tree for robotics applications

I'm writing a behavior tree (BT) for my robot which will wait for mode choosing and proceed the chosen mode. Here I use a Sequence node, the first child node will wait for a service call to /choose_mode service and then output the mode, the second child node is Switch node and will take the output as input, then proceed the corresponding mode.
Is there a standard BT structure for this case, and can you guys suggest documents about BT for robotics applications?
Thanks.

The navigation stack of ROS2 works around BT. https://navigation.ros.org/behavior_trees/index.html

Thanks for your reply, but I'm currently working with ROS1.

Hi, I am Davide, the author of BehaviorTree.CPP
You are doing it right, in my opinion.
