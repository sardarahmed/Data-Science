Q:

Error: invalid use of template-name ‘geometry_msgs::Pose_’ without an argument list

Hi,
I'm trying to create a method:
  geometry_msgs::Pose_::_orientation_type rotationVectorToQuaternion(geometry_msgs::PointStamped::_point_type rotVec, double angle) {

    geometry_msgs::Pose_::_orientation_type quaternion;
    return quaternion;

  }

To set value to:
geometry_msgs::PoseStamped poseStamped;
poseStamped.pose.orientation = rotationVectorToQuaternion(message, angle);

However i get this error:
error: invalid use of template-name ‘geometry_msgs::Pose_’ without an argument list
   geometry_msgs::Pose_::_orientation_type rotationVectorToQuaternion(geometry_msgs::PointStamped::_point_type rotVec, double angle)

This is a cpp thing, but I need some help with it.

Do you have a good reason for using the internal types instead of just the normal message names?

A:

I believe the compiler would be looking for an object with type geometry_msgs::Pose not geometry_msgs::Pose_ if you #include<geometry_msgs/Pose.h>. Is there any particular reason why you are using the return type you are?

Yes that worked. The IDE offered me only the Pose_ one. Thanks for the help!
