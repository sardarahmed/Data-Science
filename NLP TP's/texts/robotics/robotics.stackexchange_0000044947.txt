Q:

Husky model in Gazebo

I am trying to run the Clearpath Husky model in Gazebo.  The URDF and launch files are working fine and I can spawn the model, but it is crushing my high end system.  Just got off the phone with Clearpath and they are aware of the excessive fidelity of their model and looking into simplifying.
Just looking for a comparison, what kind of "% of real time" and FPS are people seeing when spawning this model in empty_world?  I am getting about 0.6-0.7 but only 1 or 2 fps.  Running Ubuntu 11.10 w/electric, 16GB mem, SSD, GTX670 w/xconfig, ivy bridge i7.
Thanks.

Odd. Checking on my end, I'm getting 0.5x real time, 20 fps. Configured for 11.10/electric, 32 GB RAM, i7-2760QM (Sandy Bridge), nVidia Quadro 2000M set to be always-on (Optimus). By all rights, your machine should shatter my numbers.

For anyone who is interested, this has been improved (currently in our stack on github, en-route to the builds). I am seeing a 300% real-time number with a Husky in an empty world on my machine.
