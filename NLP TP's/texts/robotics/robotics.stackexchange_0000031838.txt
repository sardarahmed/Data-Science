Q:

ROSJava Laserscan

hi @ all
I'm trying to implement a 2D LaserScan in my App. I found the sensor_msgs.Laserscan and i want to print/show it into a ROSImageView. Unfortunately there is no sample tutorial and maybe someone has implemented this function yet. So, now i'm trying to implement it but if there is someone, who has a solution i, yeees it would be nice! =)
Greeting

A:

I haven't used ROSImageView yet, but a quick look suggests that is is solely intended to be used with images (similar to image_view). By creating an image out of a laser scan (which could be done in various more or less hacky ways) it could be abused to display a laser scan.
AFAIK there is no built-in laser scan visualization available for ROSJava yet.

FYI, this is no longer the case. The VisualizationView and LaserScanLayer will display laser scans.
