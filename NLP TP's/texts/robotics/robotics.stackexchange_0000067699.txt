Q:

roscore works normal from command line but it does not work over ssh

I just recently installed ros-indigo on raspberry pi. The roscore works fine when I run it from the raspberry pi itself. But when i try to run it from my laptop through ssh i get the following error:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid
After termination of process rosout it restarts over and over again.
Btw sorry for my bad English. It is not my native.

A:

Did you set your locale as specified in the install instructions? http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM
