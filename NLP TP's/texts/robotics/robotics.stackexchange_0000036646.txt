Q:

Can't drive the turtle in turtlesim

I've just started working with ROS and I'm working through the beginner's tutorial. I am using Ubuntu 11.10. I'm at "Understanding ROS Topics"1.1.2 and when I implement rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key the turtle won't move around with my arrow keys.  Is there anything I need to do to set my keys so they will run the turtle?
Thanks, Gene

Hi,
The terminal which has
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

running should be the active window on the desktop for it to drive the robot. I think this is what is missed.
If not you have to post the changes if any that you made or any error that you are getting.
Hope this helps,
Karthik
