Q:

Why is move_base taking shortcuts?

Hi. In my simulations, my move_base is not properly following a path.
The planner's plan is being generated correctly, but when the robot starts to move, it is always trying to move to the final portion of my global plan.
For example, if my planner's path makes a turn around a corner, my robot tries to cut the corner straight to the final portion of my global plan, instead of following the generated path.
I tried to change move_base parameters as simple attractor or heading_scoring, but the behavior does not change.

A:

Maybe score of goal is higher than score of path.
Try set parameter goal_distance_bias = 0 or 0.1 for local planer.

thanks, that actually helped at some extent. now the robot tries to stay on the path, but very frequently it stops and start rotating in place. this did not happen with the goal_distance_bias set at default value.

Now try to increase goal_distance_bias until the desired result

it is hard to find a balance between rotating in place and following the global path. I also found problems with my simulated laser (had the wrong topic name), that would explain some of the problems I was having, as not inflating local obstacles, which resulted in robot crashing on walls. thanks
