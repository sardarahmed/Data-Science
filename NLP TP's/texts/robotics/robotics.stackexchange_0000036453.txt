Q:

arm_navigation package (lack of) scaling issue from urdf files

Hi,
I tried getting the arm_navigation tool running with my custom (non-PR2) robot .urdf file and had some issues.  The biggest (literally) issue was that my .urdf file uses .stl mesh files that are in inches that are manually scaled to meters. For example:
0.0254, being the inches-to-meters scale factor.
Now this all works fine in rviz and gazebo and whatever, but when I run the arm_navigation stack, things go a little crazy---at least in the display.  I think the motion planner pieces are working fine, but if you run the planning_components_visualizer tool or the initial wizard to set things up, the green and pink overlays are at the original scale (and thus gigantic).
Anybody seen, or aware of this?
Thanks,
Steve
