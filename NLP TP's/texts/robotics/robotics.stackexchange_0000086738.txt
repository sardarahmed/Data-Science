Q:

(Hector Slam)catkin_make error on raspberry pi3, very slow compiling

Hi there , I trying to install hector slam package on raspberry pi3 (ubuntu mate)
I installed hector slam package through git clone command
But the error generated when I compiled it. (scanning dependencies of target)
the phenomenon is that compiling speed was very slow (almost stop)
How can i solve this problem??  I have to implement hector mapping on raspberry pi3.  please answers..
Someone told me to install through apt-get (It does not require compilation  <- right?)
I'm sorry my grammer T.T

A:

Ubuntu Mate has a lot of overhead. Try the Raspberry Pi distribution from downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com.  If you have trouble compiling with a default catkin_make, use the -j1 parameter, it takes longer but may work if the default -j4 fails.
