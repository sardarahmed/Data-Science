Q:

Rosjava: How to generate new services

Dear all,
I am using rosjava to set up a service. For testing I have set up a package with roscreate-pkg. (GetCylinders.srv) The service was generated and the package was build with rosmake. All cpp files are generated.
#no request

I have already set the dependency in the rosjava service (i.e. reasoner_msgs). Here is the manifest file I use for the service.
<depend package="rosjava" />
<depend package="std_msgs" />
<depend package="reasoner_msgs" />

How do I proceed further? How can I tell rosjava to generate the corresponding java service? Is there a step by step manual somewhere?
Cheers,
Markus

Stupid me. I forgot to call rosmake again after setting the dependency. Now I included the generated java file. with #import org.ros.service.reasoner_msgs.*;
