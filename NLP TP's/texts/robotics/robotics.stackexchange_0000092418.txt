Q:

rosrun cant find package when using catkin_make_isolated

hi,
when i use catkin_make_isolated, i can build executable successfully.
but i cant use "rosrun package_name xxx" to execute it.
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named xxx below /home/xxx/catkin_ws/src/package_name
the executable is /home/xxx/catkin_ws/devel_isolated/package_name/lib/package_name/xxx.
how can i execute it using rosrun?
thanks in advance!

A:

Hi, you can navigate to the catkin_ws
cd ~/catkin_ws

then,
source ./devel_isolated/setup.bash

then you can try doing rosrun again.

if this doesn't work you might have to check if you have added it as an executable
