Q:

How to use CATKIN_IGNORE file correctly

Hello everyone
I have a catkin_ws that is composed of all the node for my project. I am working with a UAV. So some of the nodes (such as rqt_pluggins and other GCS nodes) doesn't need to be compiled on the UAV computer. My question is this, how to tell catkin make to ignore those package automaticly (yes I am aware of the command catkin_make -DCATKIN_BLACKLIST_PACKAGES="foo;bar" but it is not very usefull if i want to ignore 2 or more nodes)
Best regards,

A:

If you want to use CATKIN_IGNORE for this, just create a file with that name in each of the package directories that you want catkin to ignore. You can use touch for that, ie:
touch /path/to/catkin_ws/your/package/CATKIN_IGNORE

If you now run catkin_make (or any of the other catkin variants), it should ignore any package in that directory (and also in all subdirectories). Note that if you already built your workspace before adding CATKIN_IGNORE, the pkgs might still be picked up by catkin, as it then uses some of the information in the build directory. Simply removing build/ and devel/ and rebuilding should fix that.
The new catkin_tools package supports so called profiles, which allow you to configure the black and whitelists in a more comfortable way (and also makes switching between them very easy).

Which version onwards supports catkin tools?

@2ROS0: it'd be better to open a new question for this, as it's rather unrelated to the one you comment on. But to provide you an answer: catkin_tools is not really tied to any particular ROS release, as it's a stand-alone tool. I'd expect it to work (best) with Indigo and up though.
