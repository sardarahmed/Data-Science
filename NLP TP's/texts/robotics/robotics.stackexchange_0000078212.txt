Q:

How to properly write yaml file for ros control

Isn't their any tutorial to write exactly the syntax/rules to write a yaml file for ros controller launch. I am dealing with this type of files first time, and i didn't found tutorial for this yaml file like urdf, sdf, launch and all others. Although by studying the pre existing yaml file i can learn how to make them again, but isn't their any rules to write this file like urdf files?

A:

YAML is a standard used by many software packages, so it's described in many sites. The official site is here: http://www.yaml.org/
There's a short list of examples in the ROS wiki.
I found this online parser to be quite helpful; you can quickly check to see if your YAML snippets will be parsed correctly.
