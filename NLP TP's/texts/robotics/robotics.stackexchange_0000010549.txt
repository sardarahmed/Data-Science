Power solution for Raspberry Pi robot

I am building a Pi car with 4 gear motors (190-250mAh each max). Now I want to use my 10000mAh USB power bank to power up raspberry pi along with the 4 gear motors.
I can power up the raspberry pi directly but I want to use my power bank as the only source of power for the Pi Car. How can I connect both my RPi and motor controller L298N to my USB power bank?

A:

I'm actually in your exact situation, and have decided to do the following:
I got a power bank with two USB outputs. I intend to connect the first output directly into the raspberry Pi, and then connect the second output to a breadboard to power the motors.
              USB 1 -> Raspberry pi
             / 
   Power Bank
             \
              USB 2 -> Breadboard -> Motors

However, if my power bank just had one USB output, I would have connected it to the breadboard and powered the pi from there as well (through the 5V pin on the PI, I believe):
                                     Raspberry Pi
                                    /
    Power Bank -> USB -> Breadboard
                                    \
                                     Motors

PS: Remember to connect the grounds
In order to connect the USB to the breadboard, I will either cut open an old USB cable and solder the power wires to the board from directly, or look online for something premade that does this neatly for me.
PPS: I haven't tested this yet, so do it at your own risk :)
