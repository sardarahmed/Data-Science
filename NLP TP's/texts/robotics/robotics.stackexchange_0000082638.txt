Q:

catkin_make error: no such file or directory from custom library

Hi!
I created my own library and catkin is telling me that the header doesn't exist. Currently i am working on ubuntu 14.04 and ROSIndigo.
This is what my compiler tells me: .../signbot_plugins/src/signbot_core.cpp:1: error: signbot_plugins/classtradutor.h: No such file or directory
Here's my package order:
signbot_plugins/
      include/
            signbot_plugins/
                          classtranslator.h
       msg/
       src/
            classtranslator.cpp
            signbot_core.cpp
     CMakeLists.txt
     package.xml

Heres my CMakeList.txt:
 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)

 project(signbot_plugins)

  find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  message_generation
  roscpp
  trajectory_msgs)
  
   catkin_package(
   INCLUDE_DIRS include
   LIBRARIES signbot_plugins 
   CATKIN_DEPENDS
       message_runtime
       roscpp
        trajectory_msgs
    #  DEPENDS system_lib
  )

   include_directories(
   include
   ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  )

 add_library(classtranslator src/classtranslator.cpp)
 add_dependencies(classtranslator ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

 target_link_libraries(classtranslator ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

 add_executable(signbot_core_node src/signbot_core.cpp)
 add_dependencies(signbot_core_node signbot_core_cpp)
 target_link_libraries(signbot_core_node classtranslator ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

Can anyone help me?
Thanks

A:

From this:

Here's my package order:

signbot_plugins/

      include/
            signbot_plugins/
                          classtranslator.h
      ...

and this:

This is what my compiler tells me:

.../signbot_plugins/src/signbot_core.cpp:1: error: signbot_plugins/classtradutor.h: No such file or directory

I think the problem is that you try to #include a file called classtradutor.h, but you have an actual file called classtranslator.h.

Note that this is not a ROS problem.

Thanks for seeing that. my bad! changed the name of the class, but forgot to change the file name too.

No problem. Good to hear that solved it.
