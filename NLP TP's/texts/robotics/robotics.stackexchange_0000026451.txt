Q:

Error attempting to launch Cloudsim

Hello,
I am attempting to launch a basic CloudSim instance. I follow the tutorial here:
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/CloudSim/setup
But when I get to the following step (actually starting the instance), I get an error I cannot solve.
Specifically, I type:
./cloudsim-1.5.0/bin/create_cloudsim.py EMAIL ACCESSKEY SECRETKEY us-east-1a
Where EMAIL, ACCESSKEY, and SECRETKEY are my credentials, as appropriate. The output I get is the following: (my email replaced by EMAIL)

launch_db> c40e527fc/username = EMAIL 

launch_db> c40e527fc/constellation_name = c40e527fc 

launch_db> c40e527fc/gmt = 2013-05-29 20:35:08 

launch_db> c40e527fc/configuration = cloudsim 

launch_db> c40e527fc/constellation_directory = /tmp/tmph8ZJx1cloudsim 

launch_db> c40e527fc/constellation_state = launching 

launch_db> c40e527fc/error =  

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "./cloudsim-1.5.0/bin/create_cloudsim.py", line 50, in 

    machine = cloudsim.cloudsim_bootstrap(username, tmp_fname.name, auto_launch_constellation)

    return _default_decoder.decode(s)

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/json/decoder.py", line 365, in decode

    obj, end = self.raw_decode(s, idx=_w(s, 0).end())

TypeError: expected string or buffer

I've got all the expected arguments: (email, both keys, and the zone), so I cannot determine what string might be missing. Really no idea what's going on here; any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.

A:

Those tutorials were created for using CloudSim with Amazon Web Services. The current version of CloudSim only works with SoftLayer cloud provider. If you are using CloudSim for the DARPA VRC, read the VRC User Guide for detailed instructions of how to use the latest version of CloudSim with SoftLayer.
As Pedro suggested, 1.4.0 should work with Amazon.
