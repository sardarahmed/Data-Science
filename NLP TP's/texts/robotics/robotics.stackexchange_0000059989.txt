Q:

Problem installing packages on BeagleBone Black with ROS Hydro

Hi everyone,
I'm having trouble installing packages in ROS Hydro on BeagleBone Black with Ubuntu ARM 12.04.
For example, when I tried to install vision_visp package, I did:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-vision-visp

But I get:
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-vision-visp

The same error seem to occur when I try installing other packages as well. There is no problem with the internet connection, since I can ping another computer, and also ssh from another computer into the Beaglebone. Could I have done something wrong during the Hydro or Ubuntu installation process?
Any help is much appreciated! Thank you.

A:

According to the Hydro ARM build status page the vision_visp package isn't built for ARM.
Sorry, but you'll have to build it yourself from source.
