Q:

rqt_robot_dashboard Icon Size

If I wanted to take an existing rqt_robot_dashboard widget, say, the PR2 motors widget, and make the button twice as large, how would I do that?
(Don't suggest changing the size on line 63 because that just makes the area surrounding the icon larger, not the actual icon)

A:

I had some fun recently with this.  My solution/understanding turned out to be three parts:

Icons (svg format in my case) need to have their internal size at least as large as you are trying to do with the icon. (bizarre to me).

In rqt_robot_dashboard, where self.max_icon_size is set in setup(); I think this dictates a "canvas" size per button on the dashboard.

In e.g. nav_view_dash_widget.py, self.setFixedSize can scale the icons.  I ended up doing (and then getting distracted by other things):
  # Old version:
  #self.setFixedSize(self._icons[0].actualSize(QSize(50, 30)))
  # New version, larger, more absolute:
  self.setFixedSize(QSize(100,60))

Caveat: I'm working with a derived version of rqt_dash for Fetch robots, so I've been playing with ever so slightly different code.  Nor have I fully wrested control of the rqt_dashboard setup to my liking.

Thanks. I'll try this out soon.

A combination of three things fixed it for me.

Resizing the svg (your point 1)

Setting max_icon_size in my setup (your point 2)

Not calling setFixedSize in the widget.

Thanks for your help!
