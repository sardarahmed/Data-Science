Q:

good laser scanner/ lidar for 4 wheel robot?

i was wondering what could be a good laser scanner can someone get for as much as 180$ ? i am planning to use it from SLAM to build a map, so this is why i wanted to ask here ? have anyone tried something that gives a good result?

A:

My suggestion would be to buy a cheap, second-hand, Neato Robotics XV-15 robot vacuum-cleaner and use the LIDAR from that (you may even be able to buy the LIDAR unit separately).

A lot of guides to using the Neato LIDAR for robots have been published. For example this one from Hackaday describes how to use the Neato LIDAR with the Raspberry Pi.
Just type Neato Lidar robot into Google for more (this will also get you lots more useful background information about the LIDAR sensor itself, which is a bonus).
