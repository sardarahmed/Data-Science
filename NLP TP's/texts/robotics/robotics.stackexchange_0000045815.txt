Q:

Can I plot Euler angles in rxbag?

I would like to use rxbag to plot the yaw angle I obtain from a localization algorithm, however the orientation in geometry_msgs::PoseStamped (and most other messages) is given in quaternions. Is it possible to somehow convert that to  directly to Euler angles to plot them in the GUI?

A:

You can use the script listed at this answer to subscribe to quaternions that are published from your bag file, convert them to Euler angles, and then republish as RPY in NWU coordinates. You can then plot your Euler angles with rxplot. Use the same node multiple times while remapping topics and you can visualize Euler angles from multiple sources simultaneously.
