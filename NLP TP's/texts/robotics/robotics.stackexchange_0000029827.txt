Q:

ROS Repository apt-get tab completion

I have successfully imported the ROS Ubuntu repositories for my platform, but the bash tab-completion for the ROS packages is not present.
Tab-completion works for other packages in the Ubuntu repositories, and I can apt-get install any of the ROS packages, they just don't tab complete.
Is there any way to fix this?

A:

I'm still not entirely sure what the problem is, but running the command:
source /etc/bash_completion

Seems to have fixed the problem.
I have also added it to my ~/.bash_profile file so that it will be fixed on all shells.

@Tully Foote, it does seem like an odd problem.  It has worked with previous combinations of ROS and Ubuntu, but for some reason it didn't work this time around.  The only reason that I've asked is that I've seen the behavior on 3 computers now.  It may possibly be a Ubuntu release problem.

This is odd, but at least it's working.  Usually it just works like the other things in the repo.
