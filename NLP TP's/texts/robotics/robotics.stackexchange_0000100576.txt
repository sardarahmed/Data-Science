Q:

gpg: keyserver receive failed: No name

Hello.
I am following the installation guide for Debian Buster of ROS Noetic and in the second step, executing the comand sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654 I got the following error:
Executing: /tmp/apt-key-gpghome.nAyAX9Bj38/gpg.1.sh --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
gpg: keyserver receive failed: No name

I read that apt-key is deprecated or something like that. How can I continue the installation?
Best regards.
Alessandro

Glad you found an answer.

Hello.
Trying other ways to solve it, I finally solved it using the command:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -

Then following the rest of the steps it works fine, but for example It is not available:
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full

Instead I have used:
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop

And it is installing.
Best regards.
Alessandro
