Q:

How do I turn email notifications off on the buildfarm?

With this project http://jenkins.ros.org/job/ros-hydro-pr2-navigation-teleop_sourcedeb/
I'm getting this error which is spamming my email inbox at about 1 email a minute for the past couple of days.
[ros-hydro-pr2-navigation-teleop_sourcedeb] $ /bin/bash /tmp/hudson7223506363679838700.sh

It suggests that the URL can't open the index.yaml which might mean the buildfarm is purposefully shut down which I can respect and see. How do I turn email notifications off?

A:

I don't think there is a way to turn off the email notifications from the build farm, and if you're a package maintainer, you probably shouldn't turn them off, because their main purpose is to alert you of real build failures.
At best, you can have your email client filter them out into a folder or something.
I belive the underlying issue here is resolved, but if you see failures like this in the future you may want to email the ros-release list; the buildfarm maintainers may be able to turn emails off on a site-wide basis in events like this.
