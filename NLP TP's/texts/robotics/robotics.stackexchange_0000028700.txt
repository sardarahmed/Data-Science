Q:

Generic Pub / Sub; To and from JSON

I am interested in subscribing to a set of topics, receiving messages and sending messages to topics. I have a generic subscription as void cb_generic(const std::string& _msg). The content of the string is protobuf binary message which I want to convert to JSON. Any suggestions or examples on how to accomplish this task? The steps I see are:

Convert std::string to protobuf object
Convert protobuf object to json.

Thanks

A:

The first step would require deserialization of the binary message into a protobuf structure. Then you could translate the deserialized message into json. There might be libraries that can do the conversion for you. I think protobuf3 has support for json, but I haven't used that capability yet.
