Q:

video from node to v4l2

Hi,
I need to pass a video stream from the ardrone_autonomy package's topic 'ardrone/front/image_raw' to a v4l2 (Video 4 Linux 2) virtual device dev/video0. Is there any package that could help me do this?
Thanks for the help!

A:

I believe gscam can do this. Anything gstreamer can access, gscam can publish.
Right, that is the wrong direction.

But according to umlaeute/v4l2loopback/README gstreamer can be a 'feeder' for the virtual v4l loopback device.

Thanks for the suggestion. I am trying to use Gstreamer but so far I cannot make it work. Seems that is quite complicated to create a pipeline starting from images. I posted a new question on the forum: ar-drone without camera.
