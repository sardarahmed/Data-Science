Q:

Catkin rosconsole cross-compilation make error

Hi all,
I'm still working towards a cross-compilation of the packages in ros-comm for a Zynq ARM target running Angstrom Linux. I have now run into an issue during the catkin build process with rosconsole.
I'm getting an error while compiling rosconsole.cpp
./src/rosconsole/include/ros/console.h:55 fatal error: log4cxx/logger.h: No such file or directory error
I've set the path to the log4cxx include files directly in my rostoolchain file in the CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH variable. I've also tried setting LOG4CXX_INCLUDE_DIRS. When set in the LOG4CXX_INCLUDE_DIRS variable the directory appears in the flags.make as a -I flag in the CXX_FLAGS.
Any thoughts on what I need to set to fix this?
Thanks,
Marcus

A:

I was able to get this to work by editing the CMakeLists.txt file and setting the LOG4CXX_INCLUDE_DIRS variable directly. I then verified the same thing works in my rostoolchain file. It was a case of the path being .../include instead of the .../include/log4cxx I had been using.
Now I'm seeing the same error during the build of roscpp. The CMakeLists.txt for roscpp doesn't appear to reference the log4cxx directories or libraries, but I still see the same console.h error referring to logger.h.
Is there a better place to set the include dependency? And if roscpp has a dependency on log4cxx why doesn't it reference the LOG4CXX variables?
Regards.
