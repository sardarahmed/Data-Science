Q:

How to disable odometry from ROSAria

Hi,
is there a way to disable wheel odometry (at least the TF) that is published by ROSAria? I want to use odometry from another source like visual odometry. This is how my TF frames look like atm. I have two separate trees because ROSAria still publishes odom to base_link.
I use Ubuntu 14.04. with ROS Kinetic.
Thank you in advance.

A:

It would appear not. If you'd like that feature, it seems like a pretty straightforward change for you to contribute.
