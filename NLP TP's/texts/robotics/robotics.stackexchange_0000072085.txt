Q:

rosrun can't able to find executable of rviz

Hello,
I removed rviz from ros-groovy
$ sudo apt-get remove ros-groovy-rviz

After that from backup i coppied rviz folder into /opt/ros/groovy/share then
$ rosdep install rviz

$ rosmake rviz

rosdep and rosmake doesn't give any error. After that when i tried
rosrun rviz rviz

It is giving following error:
pr2admin@basestation:~$ rosrun rviz rviz

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rviz below /opt/ros/groovy/share/rviz

[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,

[rosrun] or not executable:

[rosrun]   /opt/ros/groovy/share/rviz

A:

The executable is actually in /opt/ros/groovy/lib/rviz/, not in share.
You didn't copy this. This is why it is not working at all.
Also you  shouldn't just copy all this stuff over from a backup, because then you cannot install or update rviz. Why don't you just install it again via apt-get?
That there are no errors when you do a rosmake is just becaus there are no makefiles in the rviz package. This is compeltely unnecessary here.
If you want to use a specific version of rviz, better build this specific version from source and have it in your workspace...
