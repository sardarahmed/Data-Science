Q:

what is the meaning of rospack profile

Is it to check the zombie file marked with * which ROS cannot use?
Then, what about those without * ?
 root@ShawnVM:~# rospack profile
Full tree crawl took 0.032583 seconds.
Directories marked with (*) contain no manifest.  You may
want to delete these directories.
To get just of list of directories without manifests,
re-run the profile with --zombie-only

A:

The main function of rospack is to
crawl through the packages in ROS_ROOT
and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, read and parse
the manifest.xml for each package, and
assemble a complete dependency tree
for all packages.

And more specifically for rospack profile:

rospack’s performance can be
adversely affected by the presence of
very broad and/or deep directory
structures that don’t contain manifest
files. If such directories are in
rospack’s search path, it can spend a
lot of time crawling them only to
discover that there are no packages to
be found. You can prevent this latency
by creating a rospack_nosubdirs file
in such directories. If rospack seems
to be running annoyingly slowly, you
can use the profile command, which
will print out the 20 slowest trees to
crawl (or use profile --length=N to
print the slowest N trees).

So the directories without *'s are the ones that contain packages.
This can all easily be found at the rospack documentation
