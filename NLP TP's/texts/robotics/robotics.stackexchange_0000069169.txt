Q:

Cannot build hector_localization

Hi all!
I'm trying to use pose estimation in the hector_localization package but I encounter problems during catkin_make.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package geographic_msgs.

  Set geographic_msgs_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
  file for geographic_msgs.  The file will have one of the following names:

    geographic_msgsConfig.cmake
    geographic_msgs-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  hector_localization/hector_pose_estimation_core/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

Anybody got any solutions?
Thanks!

A:

This means the geographic_msgs package is missing from your workspace. The easiest way to install is (assuming you're on indigo):
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-geographic-msgs 

/edit: If you cannot install via package manager, you should try adding the a source version directly to your workspace. There is a "groovy" branch available: https://github.com/ros-geographic-info/geographic_info.git. The most simple option is to just copy the package into you workspace, the recommended approach would be using wstool however (see here).

Hi there! I suspected that too. I'm using Groovy, but sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-geographic-msgs cannot be found. Any way else I can do?

Yes, I updated the answer.

Thanks! I got it. I need to create a rosbuild_ws and rosmake geographic_info and afterwards, put the same packages in catkin_ws and catkin_make again. ^^

Thank you ! ... I had the same issue ... I couldn't fix it using geographic-info ... It only worked using the apt command above.
