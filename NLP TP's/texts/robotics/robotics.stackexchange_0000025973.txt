Q:

math::pose and raySensor

I've a question about pose management and in particular regarding the world pose of a RaySensor calculation
the line 265 in RaySensor.cc
calculate the world position of the raySensor as
this->parentEntity->GetWorldPose() + this->GetPose()

while in other part of code, e.g., IMU use (at line 140-141 of ImuSensor.cc)
math::Pose parentEntityPose = this->parentEntity->GetWorldPose();
math::Pose imuPose = this->pose + parentEntityPose;

Now, I've done some experiment with the math::Pose class and I think that the second way is the right one, since pose composition uses a postfix notation. So, imho this is a bug in the RaySensor implementation. Someone have experienced problems with this?
