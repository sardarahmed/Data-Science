Q:

Why doesn't slam_gmapping sometimes update?

Hi
Why does slam_gmapping sometimes not update after a series of small movements (forward, backward, rotate left and rotate right)? Even if it is stationary for a long time, the map is not updated.
Example:

A:

By default, gmapping triggers the scan process after the robot has moved 1.0m away or rotated 0.5 radians since the last pose where the scan process was triggered.
Make sure that you move the robot far enough or set the parameter ~/temporalUpdate to something greater than 0:
~temporalUpdate (float, default: -1.0)
  Process a scan if the last scan processed is older than the update time in seconds. A value less than zero will turn time 
  based updates off.

Also, set the fixed frame in rviz to map instead of odom so that you get a correct visualization of your robot's state
