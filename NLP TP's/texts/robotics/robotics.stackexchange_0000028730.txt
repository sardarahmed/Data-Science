Q:

Get collision state of model without contact sensor

Hello everyone.
I am wondering if it is possible to check the collision state of a urdf-model in Gazebo without contact sensor.
For example, can I implement a world plugin where show which 'model:link' contacts another 'model:link'?

A:

You could subscribe to ~/physics/contacts and check for the contacts you want.
