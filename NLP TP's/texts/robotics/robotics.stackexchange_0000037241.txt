Q:

ROS Transport Layer - XML-RPC

Is the XML-RPC/TCP transport layer used for "for node to node" topic communications?
AFAIK TCP/XML-RPC transport layer is used for the "node to master" interaction, but I have no idea about what happens in a "node to node" topic communication.

Excelent. The transport mechanism for topics is a "custom ros binary format". This makes much more sense... thanks :-)
