Q:

Getting package not found error

I recently installed and have started learning about ROS
I was doing the Publisher/Subscriber tutorial given on the website
I created a package using catkin_create_package, built it using catkin_make then tried running rosrun
there it gives Package not found error.
Even rospack gives same error

Work for me here also. Unable to follow this instruction since I'm following from a book and not the ros.org tutorial.
