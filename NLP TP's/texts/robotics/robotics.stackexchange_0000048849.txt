Q:

Including uic auto generated header files in .cpp file

This may seem like a very stupid question, but I have a QT project that is built using rosbuild and CMake. The ui_form.h file is generated in the CMake build directory. I need to include this file in form.cpp to be able to access my buttons so I currently have (form.cpp is in a src subdirectory):
#include "../build/ui_form.h"

Is this the best way to do it since the build path could change? I could not think of any other way to do it, but I am sure I am missing something.

A:

I just encountered this when moving a package from catkin to rosbuild.
The solution I used was to add the line:
include_directories(include ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/build)

to the CMakeLists.txt
Then you'd be able to include your file as such:
#include "ui_form.h"
