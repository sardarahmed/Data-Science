Q:

Problem has only fixed variables-ifopt

Hi,
I am new to ifopt. I get "Problem has only fixed variables" although I am trying to add only very small changes to test_vars_constr_cost.h to solve a new optimization problem.
Could you help me?
Thank you,
Barbara

Please note: IFOPT is not ROS-related, nor maintained as part of ROS.
You'l want to find a better venue for posting these sorts of support requests.

It is. There are ROS binaries: sudo apt install ros-melodic-ifopt.

Yes, I know.
But ROS Kinetic also packages and ships with OpenCV 3 (versus v2 on the platforms it's supported on), but we still don't answer OpenCV questions here on ROS Answers.
A library which has been released through the ROS buildfarm does not make it "part of ROS" necessarily.

A:

Got it. I am not passing the bounds on the variables in GetBounds() correctly.
