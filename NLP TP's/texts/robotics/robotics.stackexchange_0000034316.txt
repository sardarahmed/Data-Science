Q:

ROS_INFO on rosserial?

Does rosserial support ROS_INFO?
I tried using it, but the compile failed.  I can see why this might be, as there is no "console" for output.
If so, is there a library or something to add?
If not, is there a way to send out a message other than standard publish?

A:

It can do ROS_INFO, but not with the same kind of syntax.
See http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial/Overview/Logging
You also need to be using rosserial from source in order to use this.
