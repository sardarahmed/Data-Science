Q:

rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node -- couldn't find executable

Hi,
I just installed ros groovy from source on gentoo amd64 and am working through the beginner's tutorials.  I'm on the "Understanding ROS Nodes" tutorial and installed the ros_tutorials metapackage from git using catkin_make in a catkin ws.  I've sourced the correct env variables and rospack list shows that ros_tutorials/turtlesim package is installed.  However, the above mentioned command fails, and a listing of all the turtlesim related directories shows no file named as turtlesim_node.  Here is my output:
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named turtlesim_node below /home/user/ros-groovy-metapackages/src/ros_tutorials/turtlesim
$ roscd turtlesim
$ ls *
CMakeLists.txt  mainpage.dox  package.xml

does anybody know anything about what may be wrong, either with the wiki or with what I've done??

A:

You need to compile it before you can run it.  rosmake turtlesim will likely do what you need.  Note the tutorials assume you're using prebuilt binaries, so you will have to make some adjustments throughout for running on gentoo.

I am using pandaboard and have the same problem even after running catkin_make. After searching of this file turtlesim_node inside my ~/catkin_ws working directory, I found it under ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/turtlesim. So I run the turtlesim_node right there with ./turtlesim_node.

it works there, but why can't rosrun find it ? btw, the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH shows that it points to my ~/ros_ws working directory. How to correct this, so I could use rosrun easily ?

found it !. I have to source my devel path too. So I put this source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash at the end of my ~/.bashrc
