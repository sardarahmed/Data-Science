Q:

Is my ROS environment perfect? or not?

I installed kinetic in ubuntu16.04, and I did operation check along ROS wiki tutorial.
I did the following command.
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src    
cd ~/catkin_ws/    
catkin_make

And I got result.
Base path: /home/username/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/username/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/username/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/username/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/username/catkin_ws/install
####
#### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/username/catkin_ws/build"    
####
####
#### Running command: "make -j4 -l4" in "/home/username/catkin_ws/build"
####

Is my ROS environment perfect? or not?
Please tell me how to solve. Thank you.

A:

That's roughly the output expected if catkin_ws has no packages in the src/ directory and you have already run catkin_make once before (meaning you already have a build/ and devel/ directory created by previous runs of catkin_make). It's impossible to say if your ROS environment is "perfect" from this, but I see no obvious issues with the information given.

I think OP can also start with using rosdep from the beginning
