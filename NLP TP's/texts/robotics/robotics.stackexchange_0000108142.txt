Q:

Controlling power input for different currents and voltages connected to the same power source

I am new to robotics and am struggling with the electronics a bit. I am using two 9 V batteries in series to provide 18 V. I need to power 2 x 12 W DC motors and an Arduino Uno. I need to divide the input power of 18 volts into 3 streams: 2 x (12 V, 1 A) streams for the motors + 1 x (6 V, 0.2 A) for the Arduino.
I thought of using a 1 Ω resistor and a 2 Ω resistor in parallel to get two streams: 12 volts and 6 volts respectively, but I am not sure if that will ensure the right current values will be drawn. I tried looking online but couldn't find a method. How can I go about carrying this out? Any help will be greatly appreciated!

A:

In addition to the above comment, you will never be able to source that much power from a pair of 9 Volt batteries. If you do use a battery eliminator circuit keep in mind that they operate in the linear regime and are therefor not very efficient. You would be better off using switch mode DC to DC converters and a LiPo battery. There are lots of options, look at spark fun and find the ratings you need. Here is a link to a converter and here are some batteries. If you need to increase the voltage use a boost converter, you dont need to stack these in series.
