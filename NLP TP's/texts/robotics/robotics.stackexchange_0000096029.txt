Q:

Noetic released but still not working on Buster

Hello everyone.
I was noticed that Noetic was at last released for Debian buster the last 23th of May, but when I try to install it the same error occurs:
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-noetic-desktop-full

Does anyone know something? It can be about the change of name from Raspbian Buster to Raspberry Pi OS?
Best regards.
Alessandro

A:

This would appear to be (almost) a duplicate of #q353123 (and #q353145).
Buster only gets amd64 and arm64 packages.
I haven't checked, but it's more than likely that Raspbian is still not 64 bit, so there aren't any binaries available for your platform.

Edit: just noticed: #q350055 is your own question, and in my edit there I also mentioned the fact that only arm64 and amd64 get binary packages.

So the only solution is try to install an image of Debian of 64 bits, right?
