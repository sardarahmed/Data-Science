Q:

rosserial non-unique executable

I installed rosserial on Groovy with catkin and it works nicely, but when I enter
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
I get:
[rosrun] You have chosen a non-unique executable, please pick one of the following:

.../catkin_ws/install/lib/rosserial_python/serial_node.py

.../catkin_ws/src/rosserial/rosserial_python/nodes/serial_node.py

Why are there two and which one should I use?

A:

They are the same file -- just one is the installed version, and one is in the source tree (which is apparently still on your path). Is there a particular reason you are using "catkin_make install"?

This page says to use catkin_make install
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
Specifically:
cd /src,
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git,
cd ,
catkin_make,
catkin_make install,
source /install/setup.bash
