Q:

Node not found after being initialized

I run this code below with a python interpreter. Then I type rosnode list from terminal. But I cannot see the node "hello". I only see "/rosout". Why?
import rospy
rospy.init_node("hello")

What do you see?

I only see "/rosout" in the list.

A:

I figured it out.
The node is  created. Then it disappears because the node program terminates. I should have put rospy.spin() at the end of the program.
