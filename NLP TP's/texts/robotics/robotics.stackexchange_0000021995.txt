Q:

How do industrial robots solve the inverse kinematic problem?

I want to make a real-time end-effector position control simulation of a 6 DOF robotic arm. To do so, I should solve the inverse kinematic problem, but due to the complexity of calculations, it is impossible to do that in real-time. As I know, industrial robots like KUKA or ABB can solve the inverse kinematic problem in real-time. Can anyone help me with the algorithms and explain those solutions to me?

A:

Closed-form inverse kinematic equations are used to determine joint angles based on the end effector pose.  These equations are well established in the literature.  For example, the classic robotics books by Craig or by Paul show the equations for typical 6dof industrial arms.
