Q:

Save rqt_plot settings

Is there any way to save the rqt_plot (topics plotted) configuration and launch it from launch file? Thank you!

A:

The rqt_plot command allows to pass topic names as arguments (run rqt_plot -h for detailed command usage). You can combine this with the --args attribute of the <node> element in roslaunch:
<launch>
  <node name="pos_vel_plot"
        pkg="rqt_plot"
        type="rqt_plot"
        args="/joint_states/position[0] /joint_states/position[1]" />
</launch>

Oops, so it is easier than I thought. Thank you, it works :)

What currently cannot be done (that was possible with rx_plot) is to have multiple subplots in rqt_plot. You can somewhat emulate that behavior with multiple rqt_plot instances in a rqt canvas, but the timelines are independent, which makes synchronized pausing impossible.
