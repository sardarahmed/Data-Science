Q:

Is it possible to embed Gazebo simulator in your own GUI?

Hi, I am working on a graphical user interface for ROS. I wanted to ask if it is possible to embed a simulator in your own gui i.e. its window opens inside your window?
Any constructive response would be appreciated.

A:

Yes, it is possible to embed Gazebo's client window into another Qt application, whether that uses ROS or not. Just like the RViz example mentioned on another answer, Gazebo can also be used as a library.
I just created a simple example program which does that:

Have you ever tried doing this in Python?

I haven't, Gazebo's API is all in C++
