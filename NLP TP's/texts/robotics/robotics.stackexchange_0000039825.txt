Q:

problem with ros fuerte install on opensuse 11.2

Hi,
The ros opensuse install page has just been updated recently and I was trying out the installation on old opensuse. I'd like to update the ros wiki regarding installing ros on opensuse with my findings.
I am facing an issue that when I run
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/fuerte -DSETUPTOOLS_DEB_LAYOUT=OFF
I get the following error
CMake Error at catkin/cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:13 (message):
   Error executing process with arguments COMMAND
   /home/mandeep/ros-underlay/build/env.sh /usr/bin/python

A:

Try running ccmake in the build directory, go over the available options and check if all path settings are OK. Maybe e.g. the python path on opensuse differs from ubuntu.
