Q:

turtlebot+hector slam possibile or not?

Is it possible to apply hector mapping on the turtlebot? Anyone did ever tried this before successfully?
Considering the poor odometry from the irobot create, I think hector slam can produce good mapping results in cluttered environment.

A:

It won't work with the Kinect, as the FOV of the simulated laser scan is very narrow. Use with a real LIDAR is possible, however. We use it on the hector_turtlebot, which is a Turtlebot with a Hokuyo UTM-30LX mounted below the Kinect.
