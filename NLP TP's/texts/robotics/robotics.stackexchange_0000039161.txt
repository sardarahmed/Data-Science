Q:

What is TurtleBot Interactive Markers's Fixed Frame?

In TurtleBot Interactive Markers Video, its TurtleBot Interactive Markers's Fixed Frame is /odom.
But my rviz should set to /base_link that I can show the whole robot of Turtlebot.

Why they are different?
Thank you~

Here I set to /odom topic which failed to interact:

Here is set to /base_link:

A:

If you set the fixed frame to /odom, you will see the robot move around in the world (on your screen). This can be useful, as you can visually register where the robot is based on the grid pattern. If you set it to /base_link, you'll have a harder time figuring out how the robot is moving.
It shouldn't make a difference to Interactive Markers functioning, but you'll probably find that it's easier to drive if you set to /odom.
