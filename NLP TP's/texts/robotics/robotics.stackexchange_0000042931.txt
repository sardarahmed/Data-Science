Q:

rosrun cannot find specified node file

Using electric on Ubuntu 11.10
I recently created a new package and node.
Something I have done before with no problems.
roscreate-pkg my_package rospy std_msgs

There were no errors with rosmake.
When I go to run the node I wrote via
rosrun my_package my_node.py

I get "No such file or directory" despite the file being in /my_workspace/my_package/nodes/my_node.py
The file is in place and set as executable, ros can find and build the package but will not run my node.
The only edits I made to the CMakeList.txt file were to uncomment the rosbuild_genmsg() and rosbuild_gensrv() lines.

A:

I've had this problem before, it's bizarre and I'm not sure what causes the problem, but I do think that I know how to solve it.  For me at least, the problem was specific to the file; other files in the package could run fine.  My solution was to re-create the node file, and copy-paste the contents. You will (hopefully) find that it now works.
