Q:

ROS Industrial website is often down

We are working on a project to explore the possibilities of ROS Industrial for SME companies. However, the ROS Industrial website (rosindustrial.org) is very often not reachable and this is not beneficial for the confidence of companies in the technology. Is it possible to host the ROS Industrial website at a more reliable provider?
I have not experienced problems with the ros.org website.

A:

Thank you for the information. Indeed, this is an issue within our organisation. The IP address of rosindustrial.org is blocked by our firewall because the website andyschwinn.com (which doesn't exist anymore) had the same IP address as rosindustrial.org and is reported as a source of cryptolocker malware. Our system administrator has manually removed the block. However, I expect that more organisations will have the same issue.

Could I please ask you to not post answers, unless you are answering your own question? ROS Answers is not a regular forum, but a Q&A site. Discussion is best done in comments.
Thanks.
