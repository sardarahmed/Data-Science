Q:

Use an external HDMI display to show the output

Hi all!!
I would like to execute the rosrun command on my laptop and showing the turtlesim window on a external HDMI display by default, but I don't know how to do it. Is there any archive where I have to change the code for doing that?
I say the turtlesim as an example, I want to do the same in my project.
Thank you.

A:

Making a window spawn in a specific place isn't really related to ROS; it's something that should be handled by your GUI library (QT, GTK, Wx, etc).
I don't think turtlesim has any arguments to make it spawn in a particular place.
Since this is for your project, and not turtlesim, you should probably ignore the turtlesim GUI and focus on your project (or a small app that uses the same windowing library)
