Q:

Problems importing SVG files

Hi,
I have installed Gazebo 11 and Inkscape on my MacBook OSX.
I am able to import in model editor the .svg files I create using Inkscape, however the dimensions of the objects do not match with those that I set in Inkscape.
For example, here I tried to create a cylinder extruding a circle of radius 500 mm, while in Gazebo it appears much smaller.

How can I solve this problem?
Thanks in advance for your help

A:

Maybe you saved the file with a different resolution? That Ridimensiona field looks suspicious.
On Gazebo, you can could increase the Resolution field when extruding the SVG.
