What do you mean by "the map does not display anything"? The costmap isn't registering obstacles?

yes

A:

You have to make sure that you also set the size of the rolling window appropriately:
rolling_window: true
width: 15.0
height: 15.0
resolution: 0.05
origin_x: 0.0
origin_y: 0.0

When using a static map, the width and height are determined using the loaded image. In a rolling window, you must manually specify these parameters for your robot. Just know that it places your robot in the center of the rolling window, so the robot can only see things that are height/2 meters away.
