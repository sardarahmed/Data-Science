Q:

Problem with reading inertia values from sdf in Gazebo

Hi there, I have a problem with defining inertia in the model sdf file. Everything is as in the code below, but when I import the model into Gazebo, it seems as if the program disregards everything in the intertial tags and inserts its own values. Is there something very obvious that I am missing?

<?xml version='1.0'?>
<sdf version="1.4">
<model name="Mymodel">
    <pose>0 0 0.0 0 0 0</pose>
    <static>true</static>
        <link name="body">
            <inertial>
                <mass>0.002</mass>
                <inertia>
                    <ixx>0.000000420478</ixx> 
                    <ixy>0.0</ixy>         
                    <ixz>0.0</ixz>         
                    <iyy>0.000000091134</iyy>      
                    <iyz>0.0</iyz>        
                    <izz>0.000000404044</izz>      
                </inertia>
            </inertial>
            <collision name="collision">
                <geometry>
                    <box>
                        <size>0.015 0.047 0.018</size>
                    </box>
                </geometry>
             </collision>
             <visual name="visual">
                <geometry>
                   <mesh>
                       <uri>model:///mymodel/meshes/mymodel.stl</uri>
                   </mesh>
                </geometry>
             </visual>
      </link>
</model>
</sdf>

A:

It's actually fine. Gazebo has some limit decimal numbers.
If you load your model using gazebo GUI and enter the edit model feature.
You can see that the inertial and mass are just as you specified

To reassure, you can try changing the number in SDF with higher number such as 5, then you can see that it actually matches the one you see in GUI.
