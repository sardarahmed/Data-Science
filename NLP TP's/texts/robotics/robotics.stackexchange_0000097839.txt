Q:

Failing to build PX4 with catkin build

I want to use PX4 launch files (mavros_posix_sitl.launch) with GAZEBO simulator, but I can't build PX4 as a ROS package.
I am using ROS melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.
I installed PX4 inside ~/catkin_ws/src using:
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive

When I try to build catkin, I get the following error:
C:\fakepath\Screenshot from 2020-12-14 11-27-58.png
What is wrong?
Thanks

A:

You are not supposed to build PX4 as a ROS package.
You are supposed to build it using make using the command make px4_sitl_default gazebo if you want to use it with Gazebo and then just source the setup files and put PX4 in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
All the instructions are there in the official documentation of PX4.
