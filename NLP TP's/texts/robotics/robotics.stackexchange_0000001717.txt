Q:

How to determine the parameter of a Complementary Filter?

I know that the Complementary Filter has the functions of both LPF and HPF. But I think my understanding on the principal behind it is still unclear.
I am quite new on digital signal processing, and maybe some very fundamental explanations will help a lot.
Say I have a Complementary Filter as follows:
$$y =a\cdot y+(1-a)\cdot x$$
Then my parameter $a$ may be calculated by $$a=\frac{\text{time constant}}{\text{time constant}+\text{sample period}}$$
where the $\text{sample period}$ is simply the reciprocal of the $\text{sampling frequency}$.
The $\text{time constant}$ seems to be at my own choice.
My Questions:

What is the theory behind this calculation?
How do we choose the $\text{time constant}$ properly?

Note: I also posted this question on Stack Overflow, as the answers there are likely to be slightly different in emphasis.

A:

The complementary filter you mentioned comprises of both a low-pass filter (which filters out, or attenuates, short term accelerometer fluctuations), as well as a high pass filter (which tries to negate the effect of drift on the gyroscope).

A time constant $\tau$ with respect to first order filters describes at what point (the cut-off frequency $f_{c}$) information should start being rejected (LPF) or stop being rejected (HPF). With respect to a complementary filter the time-constant used is the same for both the LPF as well as the HPF. The time constant can be thought of as boundary between trusting the gyroscope, and trusting the accelerometer.
The value of $a$, or the time constant, should be a function of your gyroscope's drift and accelerometer noise. You can optimize to filter out gyroscopic drift (HPF with slow cut-off), but then your accelerometer will allow too much accelerometer noise (LPF with slow cut-off).
As with all filter design, calculate the filter coefficients, test it to confirm it doesn't work, and randomly tweak it till it does.
