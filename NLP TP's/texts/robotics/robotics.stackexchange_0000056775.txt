Q:

does pocketsphinx work with ros hydro?

I am trying to find a speech processor to convert from audio to text and was wondering if pocketsphynx package which is available here works with ros hydro because the tutorial asks us to use rosmake which was used for ros fuerte.

What tutorial? Could you post a link? The main page on the wiki is updated http://wiki.ros.org/pocketsphinx

http://www.pirobot.org/blog/0022/ I was talking about this tutorial.

A:

The tutorials you are looking at are probably out of date. The hydro-devel branch on github: https://github.com/mikeferguson/pocketsphinx is updated to use catkin, and is also released to debians (so you can install via "sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pocketsphinx")

I'm getting ready to try the mikeferguson/pocketsphinx ver. Do you still need sphinxbase in the installation?
Thanks,  Gulfbo64
