A:

I would suggest you to install ROS first and to take a look at ROS beginner tutorials to have an idea how ROS generally works.

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials

Finishing the beginner tutorials shouldn't take you more than one day of your time. Once you have some basic understanding of ROS, check this tutorial : `

http://wiki.ros.org/roboearth_stack/Tutorials/Using%20recorded%20models%20for%20object%20detection

it explains how to use roboearth with a kinect for object recognition. But first you should also install those ROS packages/stacks

OpenNI : http://wiki.ros.org/openni  Necessary accessing the data recorded by your Kinect

RoboEarth http://wiki.ros.org/roboearth_stack Contains useful packages for accessing RoboEarth functionalities

Steps needed to install those packages are explained each package's page. This might be a slow solution that could take few days of your time but I think that the time invested in learning ROS basics is definitely worth it.
