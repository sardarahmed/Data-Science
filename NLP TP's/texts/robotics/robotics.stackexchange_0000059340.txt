Q:

Is there a 3DSLAM package for ros-hydro?

I was looking to do 3d pointcloud construction using a kinect, but i was unable to find and suitable package for the same.
If someone would be kind enough to suggest something.

A:

You should state your problem more precisely.
Did you consider OctoMap or RGBDSLAM ?
You may find something relevant at http://openslam.org/ though it may not yet be available as a ROS package.
