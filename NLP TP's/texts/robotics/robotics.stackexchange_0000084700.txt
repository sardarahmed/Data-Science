Q:

Does rostopic use message broker between nodes?

Hi,
Do nodes in ROS send/receive messages through a message broker or are TCP/UDP packets sent directly between the publishing and subscribing nodes? I don't see such a broker mentioned in the ROS "concepts" doc but the "hello robot" messaging example seems to imply the existence of a broker because the hello message is stored somewhere for echoing before a subscriber is online. If there is indeed a message broker in the middle of the communication path, is the Master node that broker?
Thanks,
yc

A:

The data communications over a topic are direct without a broker. There is a master which helps nodes connect to each other. Please see the technical overview here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Technical%20Overview#Example
If you edit your question to point to what example you're referring to I or someone else could provide more information about that context.

Thanks for you answer! I should have continued reading to the end of the "ROS/Concepts" instead of being befuddled by the "rostopic echo" command in "Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics". Your answer clarified it. Thanks!
