Q:

tf tutorial warning message

Hi,
I am trying to follow this tutorial, but I got the following messages:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/geometry_tutorials/turtle_tf/nodes/turtle_tf_listener.py", line 57, in <module>
    (trans,rot) = listener.lookupTransform('/turtle2', '/turtle1', rospy.Time())
tf.ExtrapolationException: Lookup would require extrapolation at time 1333037934.805088997, but only time 1333037934.805421114 is in the buffer, when looking up transform from frame [/turtle1] to frame [/turtle2]
[turtle_pointer-6] process has died [pid 3789, exit code 1].
log files: /home/user/.ros/log/e0b84f1e-79ba-11e1-87ee-0023aea58509/turtle_pointer-6*.log

Could anyone resolve this problem?
My system info: Ubuntu 11.04, ROS electric

A:

I have edited turtle_tf_listener.py, and added tf.ExtrapolationException to the list of exceptions caught on line 58, so that my line 58 now reads:
except (tf.LookupException, tf.ConnectivityException, tf.ExtrapolationException):

This basically just catches the exception and moves on. Not sure if this is the recommended solution, but at least I can move on with the tutorial now :)
