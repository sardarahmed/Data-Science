Q:

StaticMapPlugin not loading in gazebo11

I tried using the static map plugin following the tutorial in http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=static_map_plugin&cat=build_world
However, the plugin doesn't load properly.
[Err] [Plugin.hh:178] Failed to load plugin libStaticMapPlugin.so: libStaticMapPlugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

A:

Actually, this was because I didn't source the environment properly.
Fixed by
