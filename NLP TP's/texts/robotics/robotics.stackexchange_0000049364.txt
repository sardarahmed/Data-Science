Q:

ROSSERIAL and Helloworld issue on arduino 2560

Hi!
I am quiet new to ubuntu and arduino. I managed to install arduino IDE, ROS and even ROSSERIAL.
Now while compiling (uploading) the hello world example I have a lot of errors and I don't know how to fix them.
Here I provided a printscreen of my IDE, terminal and also my home folders...maybe you can advise me something...

P.S: my system information
Intel® Core™ i7-2630QM CPU @ 2.00GHz × 8
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
64bit
Thank you in advance

Did you load the example from the lib in the arduino interface? Looks like your library is not correctly installed..

Yes I used the example from ros_lib that I installed few hours ago. I took also a printscreen during my installation because I had an IOError (maybe that's why I have troubles). Any ideas how to fix it?    http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/268/screenshotfrom201303141.png/

Ok I figured out and fixed the problem thanks to my teacher! But there is definetly a bug with catkin and probably 64bits Ubuntu 12.04LTS. It would be nice if some developpers would find time to check it for the future...

Then please file a bug report (and also post your solution so that others can solve the problem also).

You need to edit your bashrc file by doing the next:   gedit gedit ~/.bashrc
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/alexander/catkin_ws/install/share:/home/alexander/catkin_ws/install/stacks:/home/alexander/catkin_ws:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

A:

Solution (for ROS groovy and Ubuntu 12.04LTS 64bit):
You need to edit your bashrc file by doing the next in terminal:  $gedit ~/.bashrc
After that you need to specify the path like this (just copy and paste somewhere inside):
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/YOURNAME_PROBABLY/catkin_ws/install/share:/home/YOURNAME_PROBABLY/catkin_ws/install/stacks:/home/YOURNAME_PROBABLY/catkin_ws:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Info: catkin_ws is the catkin workspace that you should have settled up during ROS installation
After that I had also the problem while running:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0
That USB0 should be ACM0 (for arduino)
That was it in short!
