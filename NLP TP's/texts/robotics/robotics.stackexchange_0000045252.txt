Q:

Access to ros_comm source code in fuerte

I've noticed that in Fuerte when you install the package ros-fuerte-ros-comm (and other low level ros packages) the installation follows the FHS layout, and the source code is no longer installed.
What is the easiest way to have access to this source code? (Somehow making sure that the source and my installed code are the same version).

A:

The usual way to find the correct source should be:
$ roslocate info ros_comm --distro=fuerte

However, that does not seem to work for ros_comm in Fuerte.
On my system, leaving off the --distro option yields this:
$ roslocate info ros_comm 
- svn:
    local-name: ros_comm
    uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/trunk

That is probably not the exact version released with Fuerte. Assuming that the repository is at least correct, I'd recommend checking this out, instead:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/tags/fuerte/

The recommended way to manage source overlays is with rosws. There are already answers for questions about rosws on this same Q&A site.
