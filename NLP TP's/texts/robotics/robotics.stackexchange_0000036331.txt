Q:

publishing and subscribing Gyro msgs in a Turtlebot

Hello,
Does anybody know how exactly the Gyro messages (imu/data; imu/raw) are subscribed/published in the turtle-bot node?
I have an ICreate Robot that doesn't have an inbuilt Gyro..But when I launch the turtlebot dashboard, it displays some random values in place of Gyro messages! I am not sure why that happens! I am trying to use an external Gyroscope (it publishes IMU messages) to publish the Gyro messages instead of the default ones published from the turtlebot node... Can anyone tell me how to go about doing it?
I realized a simple "remapping" of messages wouldn't work in this case!
Would really appreciate any kind of help that you can provide!
Thanks.
Divya

A:

The TurtleBot power board has a gyro attached to the analog in. The create reads the data from the analog input and publishes it on imu/data. Set the has_gyro parameter to false and then it should not publish gyro data anymore.
To publish your own gyro data to ROS you need to either use an existing ROS driver for your gyro or write your own ROS drive to publish an Imu msg on the imu/data topic.

I edited by answer above and what type of gyro do you own?

thank you. It worked. But do you also know how I can use the output from my own gyroscope and send it to the turtlebot?

@mmwise, i suppose that the answer you provided is specifically for move_base roomba only? do you have any idea how can i do this for kobuki?

@chao please be more specific about what "this" is. All Kobuki's have the gyro so I'm not sure how this is relevant.
