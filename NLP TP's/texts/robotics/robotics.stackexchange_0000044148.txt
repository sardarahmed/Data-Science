Q:

Rosbag play very slow (and CPU load 100 percent)

Hey guys,
i recently recorded some Kinect Motion tracking data using rosbag record and am now playing it using rosbay play (I'm on Ubuntu Oneiric and ROS Fuerte). But it plays really slow (feels like approx. 1/10 th realtime and CPU usage of one core goes up to 100 %) although I only recorded tf (returned from openni_tracker) and one string message:
$ rosbag info day1_cereals.bag 
path:        day1_cereals.bag
version:     2.0
duration:    2:18s (138s)
start:       Aug 29 2012 11:34:24.88 (1346232864.88)
end:         Aug 29 2012 11:36:43.07 (1346233003.07)
size:        300.0 MB
messages:    78576
compression: none [204/204 chunks]
types:       std_msgs/String [992ce8a1687cec8c8bd883ec73ca41d1]
             tf/tfMessage    [94810edda583a504dfda3829e70d7eec]
topics:      /object_detections    1085 msgs    : std_msgs/String (1085 connections)
             /tf                  77491 msgs    : tf/tfMessage    (77491 connections)

Is this performance normal? I would think that it should perform way faster (i use an I7 2,3 Ghz Quadcore)... The number of TF transforms is below 50 (output of openni_tracker plus camera frames plus some object detections). Did someone experience similar issues?

A:

Seems like this is a known problem ( http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/Problems-with-rosbags-in-Electric-on-Oneiric-td3465949.html ) which is the result of the creation of one connection per message.
However the problem doesn't appear any more after running a rosbag fix on the bagfiles.
