Q:

catkin permission

Hello,
I installed ROS as a root, and now I am getting this error when I try to run catking_init_workspace:
Could neither symlink nor copy file "/opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake" to "/home/user/worspace/src/CMakeLists.txt":
- [Errno 13] Permission denied
- [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/user/worspace/src/CMakeLists.txt'

How can I get rid of this issue?
Thanks

A:

It is generally not a good idea to install ROS as root... Even when built from source, a home directory is usually used. Because you installed as root, you have a problem here with permissions... Unless you want to sudo !! for the rest of your time using ROS, I'd say it's a good time to reinstall...

A reinstall is not necessary, but you should consider removing the whole directory tree or chown -R user /home/user/workspace and or rm -rf /home/user/workspace and any other place you have root owned files in your user directory.
