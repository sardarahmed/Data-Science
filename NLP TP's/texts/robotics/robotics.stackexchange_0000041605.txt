Q:

Two ros roots defined in config, delete one

I believe that I am having the same problem as defined in this question, and like the poster Felix, rosinstall never finishes and the setup files are not generated. Can anyone tell me how to fix this problem? The exact input and output I have is this:

~$ rosinstall ~/ros-py3 /opt/ros/electric http://ias.cs.tum.edu/~kargm/ros_electric_py3.rosinstall</br>
rosinstall operating on /home/bakerea2/ros-py3 from specifications in rosinstall files  /opt/ros/electric, http://ias.cs.tum.edu/~kargm/ros_electric_py3.rosinstall

Thanks for reading.

A:

You need to leave out the /opt/ros/electric in your rosinstall call, i.e. you need to call rosinstall like this:
rosinstall ~/ros-py3 http://ias.cs.tum.edu/~kargm/ros_electric_py3.rosinstall

When you have a look at the rosinstall file, you'll see that the first line checks out the stack ros which normally is the ROS_ROOT until Electric. That's why you cannot pass /opt/ros/electric since it provides a second (unpatched) ROS_ROOT.
