Q:

Traditional processing is deprecated

When I am trying launch my gazebo project with: "roslaunch spider1_gazebo spider1_gazebo.launch"
I have the following problem:
Traditional processing is deprecated. Switch to --inorder processing!
To check for compatibility of your document, use option --check-order.
For more infos, see http://wiki.ros.org/xacro#Processing_Order
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/jade/share/xacro/xacro.py", line 61, in <module>
    xacro.main()
  File "/opt/ros/jade/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xacro/__init__.py", line 967, in main
    out.write(doc.toprettyxml(indent='  '))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf3' in position 1382: ordinal not in range(128)
Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: command [/opt/ros/jade/share/xacro/xacro.py '/home/d46/catkin_spider/src/spider1/spider1_description/urdf/spider1.urdf.xacro'] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is <param command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py '$(find spider1_description)/urdf/spider1.urdf.xacro'" name="robot_description"/>

The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
When I run:  rosrun xacro xacro --inorder spider1.urdf.xacro > spider1.urdf
It show the following:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/jade/lib/xacro/xacro", line 33, in <module>
    xacro.main()
  File "/opt/ros/jade/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xacro/__init__.py", line 967, in main
    out.write(doc.toprettyxml(indent='  '))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf3' in position 1646: ordinal not in range(128)

What is the solution to this?

There seems to be a problem with encoding a  character ;-)
Please add the respective file (or at least the relevant part), otherwise we cannot help.

A:

I'm pretty sure that the Traditional processing is deprecated [..] warning does not have anything to do with the actual problem, which is that f3 is a unicode character, which cannot be encoded in an ASCII range. The xacro most likely either declares an ASCII encoding in its xml declaration, or is missing a declaration all together and the default is to assume ASCII.
In any case, look at 'position 1646': there should be an 'รณ' there (according to this site anyway). Remove it (or change the file to at least utf-8) and it should solve your issue.

Thank you very much. I removed the character from the code - it was in the comment section - and now it works.
Thanks again!
