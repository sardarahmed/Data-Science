Q:

need topological map online, graph_slam doesn't work

Has anybody had success using the graph_slam package described at
http://www.ros.org/wiki/graph_slam
I tried checking out the source and building it but the dependencies do not build.
Or do you have any suggestions how I can build a topological map out of a SLAM gridmap fairly efficiently on the fly?
Edit: I am using the cturtle-pr2all stack

CTurtle, sorry about that
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-03-29:
Could you include which release (CTurtle or Diamondback) you are trying to use?

A:

I didn't see this question till now, unfortunately.  If you still need this, you can check out the new version of the topological_navigation stack (see www.ros.org/wiki/topological_navigation for instructions).  In particular, the topological_map_2d package defines the topological map type and the laser_slam_mapper package constructs a node that constructs it.
