Q:

arm navigation 6dof

Hi guys
I created moveit package and wrote drivers for my 6 dof manipulator and I also can control manipulator with moveit. I also created joint trajectory action server for moveit and simulation of robot in Gazebo. But I dont like idea that  I have to plan the path and than execute. I would like to use or create teleoperation control of my robotic manipulator with joystick "real-time". So it would follow the axes X Y Z and maybe do some basic rotations around point. Can you help me how to realize that and maybe give me som hints ?
Thanks for your help

A:

If your application needs a point-by-point control over the path rather than automated navigation between start and destination poses like MoveIt! does, you may use other tools. Descartes is good for that purpose.

Thank you for your advice. It looks good and I will try to use that package

I'm also interested in this. But on that page is says "Similar to MoveIt, but different than other planners, Descartes is primarily focused on offline or sense/plan/act applications. Real-time planning is not a feature of Descartes." That sounds like it isn't able to do what Chickenman is asking.

yeah I read it too and I can use it for better trajectory planning but I am still looking for something for "real time" applications

Yeah, I wonder what that text is referring to when it says "other planners". If you find anything let me know, I'll do the same.
