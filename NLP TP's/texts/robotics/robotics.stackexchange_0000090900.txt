Q:

Disable generation of Javascript, Lisp, EusLisp messages

In a standard CMakeLists.txt, message parsing code for Javascript, Lisp and EusLisp gets generated, but I'm not interested in these. Is there an easy way to disable this generation?

The environment variable ROS_LANG_DISABLE is documented in the wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_LANG_DISABLE

@Dirk Thomas' answer is correct, but I've still closed this as a duplicate, as there are at least two older Q&As that deal with the exact same question: #q213511 and #q260865 (which refers back to #q213511).
@KenYN: which keywords did you use to search, and did you not find the two linked Q&As?
