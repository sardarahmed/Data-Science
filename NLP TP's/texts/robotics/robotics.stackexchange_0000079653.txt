Q:

Attach two links of an object to two links of the robot

Hello all,
I am working with a humanoid robot for transportation of objects.
My objective is to simulate the grasping with both hands of a table from two different links.
As grasping is giving some problems I wanna attach the hand links to the table lnks in a certain manner.
In the first approach I developed a Spring-damper model, but I need a better attaching where a movement of one link, means the movement of the other.
I didnt find any solution.
All sugestions are welcome!!
Bests,
Julen U.
