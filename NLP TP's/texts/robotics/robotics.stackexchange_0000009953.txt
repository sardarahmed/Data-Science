Q:

kalman filter with redundant sensors

Suppose I have one robot with two 3D position sensors based on different physical principles and I want to run them through a Kalman filter. I construct an observation matrix two represent my two sensors by vertically concatenating two identity matrices.
$H = \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\\1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}$ $\hspace{20pt}$
 $\overrightarrow x = \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z \end{bmatrix}$
so that 
$H \overrightarrow x = \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z\\x\\y\\z \end{bmatrix}$
which represents both sensors reading the exact position of the robot. Makes sense so far. The problem comes when I compute the innovation covariance
$S_k = R + HP_{k|k-1}H^T$
Since 
$H H^T = \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 \end{bmatrix}$ 
then, no matter what $P$ is, I'm going to wind up with $x$ innovations from the first sensor being correlated to $z$ innovations from the second, which seems intuitively wrong, if I'm interpreting this right. 
Proceeding from here, my gain matrix ($K = P_{k|k-1} H^T S_k^{-1}$) winds up doing some pretty odd stuff (swapping rows and the like) so that, when updating a static system ($A = I_3, B = [0]$) with a constant measurement $\overrightarrow z = [1,0,0]$ I wind up with a predicted state $\hat x = [0,0,1]$.
If I separate the sensors and update the filter with each measurement separately, then $H H^T = I_3$, and I get sensible results.
I think I am confused about some technical points in one or more of these steps. Where am I going wrong? Does it not make sense to vertically concatenate the observation matrices?
I suppose that I could just set the off-diagonal 3x3 blocks of $S_k$ to 0, since I know that the sensors are independent, but is there anything in the theory that suggests or incorporates this step?

A:

Are you sure about your expression for $HH^T$?
I get
$$
HH^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
which agrees with your intuition.
