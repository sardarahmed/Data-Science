Q:

Why qtcreator cannot find catkin packages?[SOLVED]

These are workspaces that could be successfully catkin_make in ternimal. I sourced the workspace in terminal and then launched qtcreator. But qtcreator still cannot find many catkin packages. I do not know why terminal ould find all the packages but qtcreator cannot.
Ubuntu 16.04
QtCreator version :
Qt Creator 4.5.1 based on Qt 5.10.0
ROS Kinetic(if this is any pertinent)

Did you setup build directory and so on when you open your project in qt?

I do not see options to setup build directory. If you mean going to tools->options->Build & Run->General->Directory, yes i did. Could you give me a link to what you are mentioning??

The error i get usually is related to catkin components. for example
CMakelist.txt: find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS):
Error:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by
"cv_bridge" ...

I figured out what was lacking. I solved it by adding /opt/ros/kinetic to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in Project -> build environment

I had the same issue. A bit disappointing that the QtCreator ROS-Plugin does not source ROS in an automated fashion. Thank you for your hint about adding it to the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH did the trick.
I found that if you do not want to do so every time your ROS package, you can include the following to your top-level CMakeList (the one you use to open the project):
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/opt/ros/kinetic/")

OP does not state he's using the QtC ROS plugin. It would seem he's using plain Qt Creator.
And if you are using the QtCreator ROS plugin: it should automatically setup include paths and everything else for you. If it doesn't, that would be an issue to solve and you should report it.
