Q:

How to "Rostopic echo" only the pose in the 'odom' topic

I'm a beginner in ROS, and as such I'm struggling with an apparently simple question. I'm using Turtlbot in Gazebo and would like to print in a text file the pose of the robot during its path. What I do now is to "echo" the /odom topic and there I can see the pose. However, it prints a lot of other information I do not need. How can I somehow filter it, to only print the pose of the robot (x, y, z) during the robot's path.
Thank you in advance for considering this.

A:

Use slash / for name resolution, i.e. to go deeper into the objects and structures.
In your case it should be something like:
$ rostopic echo /odom/pose/pose/position

It should return x, y and z all of type float64.
That is because Odometry message has field pose which is of type geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance, which has another pose of type geometry_msgs/Pose and then there are two fields -- position and orientation.

Thanks, but what about when there is an array structure in the middle, how to go deeper ? I posted my question here : http://answers.ros.org/question/220434/rostopic-echo-of-a-field-of-an-array-in-ros-indigo/
