Q:

Gazebo and ROS2 roadmap

2 questions on the Gazebo roadmap:

AFAIK, all ROS2 variants through Eloquent recommend Gazebo 9. Is there an idea to have ROS2 Foxy use Gazebo 11?

Can I run Gazebo 10 with ROS2 Eloquent and gazebo_ros_pkgs?

Thanks.

A:

The gazebo_ros_pkgs that you get from the ROS buildfarm depend on the Gazebo version that is available upstream on Ubuntu. Since we're planning on releasing Gazebo 11 into Ubuntu 20.04, that should be the version that comes with Foxy (and Noetic).
We also release other combinations of Gazebo / ROS versions into the OSRF packages as needed. So far, no one has asked to use ROS 2 with Gazebo 10, so we haven't released that. If you're interested, you could make sure it compiles, and ticket an issue asking for the release and we'll work on it as soon as we can.

Thanks for the quick answer! I'll wait for 11 & Foxy.
