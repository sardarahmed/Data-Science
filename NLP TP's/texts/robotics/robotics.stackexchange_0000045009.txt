Q:

Ros Launch File

Can anyone describe, in detail, the parameters involved in the launch file. I combed through the tutorials and the descriptions are not that adequate?
Is there an example you can point me to as well that call 3 or more packages/nodes? The type and name parameters have me at a slight loss...
I am trying something like:

But with the <! commented lines added. I receive errors on rov_teleop and teleop_rov_joy saying no such type. If my package is named rov_telop (yeah i know i wasn;t paying attention when I named it) and two nodes that work with "joy" are teleop_rov_move and teleop_rov_joy, what would the proper type and names be? I've tried pkg="rov_telop" type="teleop_rov_move" name="teleop_rov_mov" but no go...

There are a number of launch files in ROS projects on Github.  That would likely be a great place to find some real-world examples to help you out:
