Q:

Unable to subscribe ros topic generated on different architecture machine

Hello, I'm working on a project in which I am trying to use my laptop as roscore and using beaglebone black as ros client. I have run into some issue, I cannot make a ros topic which would be readable on both sides (beaglebone and laptop). I tried running the most simple beginner_tutorial talker.py:

I set ROS_MASTER_URI on both machines to my laptops ip address and start roscore.

On beaglebone i run rosrun beginner_tutorials talker.py and everything starts without any errors. I find new topic listed under rostopic list and everything looks fine.

I try to subscribe to messages using rostopic echo /chatter on laptop and nothing appears.

Running rostopic echo /chatter on beaglebone I can see "Hello world" messages.

Both machines are running Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Groovy installations. Beaglebone has ros-groovy-ros-bare-bones package and laptop has ros-groovy-ros-desktop-full package. It seems communication is fine, but messages is not interpreted on my laptop, maybe someone have some information why can`t I receive messages?

A:

This is likely a ROS environment configuration issue and not related to the machine architecture. Take a look at the network configuration troubleshooting wiki page.
