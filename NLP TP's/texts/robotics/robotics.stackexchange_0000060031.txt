Q:

Failed to invoke rospack to get compile flags for package 'tum_ardrone'

rosmake ardrone_autonomy is ok, but rosmake tum_ardrone has problem. All source from wiki.ros.org/tum_ardrone.
My error is showed as follows:

Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
broken dependency!

A:

Just some quick thoughts:

You are using fuerte. Are you certain that you downloaded the fuerte-branch of the ardrone_driver (Not the tum_ardrone)?

If I recall correctly, you had to compile the SDK seperatly first, before invoking ROS commands. Did you do that?

Could you reformat your question such that all your command line output is formatted? :)
