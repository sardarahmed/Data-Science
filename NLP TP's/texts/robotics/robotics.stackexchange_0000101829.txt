Q:

Citing ROS in a scientific article

Is it obligatory to quote ROS when mentioned in a scientific article? Is there a strict rule on this matter?

A:

It depends, at least for me.
If it's an important part of your research (e.g. you prepared a special protocol for experimental validation of results, used some packages from ROS toolkit, etc.), then you should mention it by citing the ICRA 2009 article
or at least by giving a site link like this:
Open Source Robotics Foundation. Robotic Operating System.\url{https://www.ros.org}
If it was used somewhere on your robot, but wasn't important to the overall publication, I would skip it (but it should be in the project documentation beyond those few pages in the journal).
