Q:

Is it possible to mimic two joints combined?

Hi,
I have a couple of closed loop mechanisms connected in which there is rotary joint A, B and a prismatic joint C . Joint A should  mimic joint B&C combined.
something like this
A =  B + 0.5*C
Is this possible in URDF  mimic tag ? bit confused.

A:

From the documentation:

The value of this joint can be computed as value = multiplier * other_joint_value + offset.

So no, referring to two joints is not supported right now.
You may be able to do something with transmission, but I'm not sure.
