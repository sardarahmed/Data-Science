Q:

teb local planner installation

Hi everyone
I am kind of new for the ROS, and when I tried to follow the instruction from ROS wiki to install the teb_local_planner, I have encounter some error, I am currently using ubuntu 14.04LTS.
So here is the prompt I used and the reply I receive
samping@samping-HP-250-G4-Notebook-PC://$ sudo apt-get install ros-{distro}-teb-local-planner
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-{distro}-teb-local-planner
Can anyone provide me some help on installing this package?

How do I accept it, I can't find the button

A:

Hey,
just replace {distro} in the command with your ROS-Distribution (indigo, jade):
On indigo:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-teb-local-planner

On jade:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-teb-local-planner

I've updated the tutorials page to include buttons for version selection and hence avoiding {distro} in commands.

Hi croesmann, I'm still not able to install teb_local_planner for indigo (on Ubuntu 16.04), even with the command sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-teb-local-planner. Can you check if it works for you now?

I also searched on Ubuntu's App Directory, but could not find any package relating to "teb"

hi @kaiyu, if you are on Ubuntu 16.04, you are probably running ROS Kinetic since Indigo is not available for 16.04. After successfully installing ROS, invoke sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-teb-local-planner.
