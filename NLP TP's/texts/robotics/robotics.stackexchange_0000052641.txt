Q:

Errors in connecting an Arduino to Ros Groovy

I'm trying to get an Arduino Uno hooked up to Ros Groovy; I've been following the Hello World tutorial for rosserial_arduino. When running

rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

I'm able to connect for a second, and I start getting the error:

[ERROR] [Walltime: ...] Lost sync with device, restarting...

I noticed my Arduino code is still running even though it lost connection (I have a flashing LED indicator). Its not publishing anything to "Chatter" however - not even once before it disconnects.
Please let me know how I might be able to fix this!
Thanks!

A:

Hi there, I've come to a similar situation in ROS Indigo. This was mostly due to having the Arduino IDE open with the Serial Port open.
After I uploaded the code to the arduino and closed the IDE and restarted the rosserial server the error was gone.
