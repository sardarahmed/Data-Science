Q:

Which controller (PI or PD) is generally more robust to noisy sensor measurements and why?

Assuming no filter is used to measure error (or rate of change in error) with respect to a desired state, would a PI controller more/less/about equally robust to signal input noise compared to a PD controller? And why?  
My intuition tells me that they would be about equally bad/good because wild changes in the measured state would generate equally bad spikes in either the I or D terms.  I have, however, read some (probably not reliable) sources alluding to the possibility that PI controllers are generally more robust to noisy measurements than PD controllers.  Is this true? And if it is true, why would a PI controller be more robust to noise than a PD?

A:

Proportional control amplifies equally across all frequencies.
Integral action amplifies low frequencies more, and high frequencies less (in fact, its gain at DC is infinite, and at infinite frequency its gain is zero).
Differential action amplifies low frequencies less, and high frequencies more (it has zero DC gain and unless its bandlimited, infinite gain at high frequencies).
Noise tends to be equally distributed across the frequency band.

So a PD controller will tend to be more sensitive to noise.  Whether it's more robust depends on your situation: there are some plants that can't be satisfactorily controlled without differential action.
