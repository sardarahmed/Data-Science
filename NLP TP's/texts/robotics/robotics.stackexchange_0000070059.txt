Q:

Published Cloud with 0 points - Laser scan assembler

I have a bag file gotten from my laser sensor. Currently, I can see the stream of scans with Rviz, but I need to create a 3D view of the robot environment to be used as collision objects for path planning. Then I read about laser_assembler package but it doesn't work for me.
I run the bag file, then launch the laser_scan_assembler.launch:
<launch>
  <node type="laser_scan_assembler" pkg="laser_assembler" name="laser_scan_assembler">
    <param name="max_scans" type="int" value="400" />
    <param name="fixed_frame" type="string" value="laser" />
  </node>
</launch>

and finally the periodic snapshotter, but I got this:
INFO: Published Cloud with 0 points
INFO: Published Cloud with 0 points

How could I solve it?
The rosbag info on my file shows:

Thank you

A:

You require two mre things:

Remap scan topic to tilt_scan
Your transformations (tf messages) are missing.
