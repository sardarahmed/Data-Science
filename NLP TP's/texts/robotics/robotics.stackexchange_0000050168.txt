Q:

Problem with rosbuild workspace in Groovy

Hi,
I'm trying to migrate from Electric to Groovy (Ubuntu 11.10, 64bit). Trying to setup rosbuild workspace for my old packages using this tutorial. But getting some weird error:
imaterna@fitpc:~$ mkdir ~/rosbuild_ws
imaterna@fitpc:~$ cd ~/rosbuild_ws
imaterna@fitpc:~/rosbuild_ws$ rosws init . /opt/ros/groovy
ERROR: Invalid scm entry having no uri attribute for path /opt/ros/groovy/setup.sh
Error: rosinstall failed: None

Any idea? Many thanks in advance...
UPDATE: There is rosws and wstool... I'm bit confused. What's the difference and which of them should I use?
UPDATE2: Maybe there is something wrong with my ROS installation... I can't even start rqt_console:
imaterna@fitpc:~$ rqt_console 
WARNING: Package name "swig-wx" does not follow the naming conventions. It should start with a lower case letter and only contain lower case letters, digits and underscores.

UPDATE 3: Removed ROS related stuff in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ (rosinstall, vcstools) but it didn't help. Now I can't even run rosws:
imaterna@fitpc:~$ rosws --version

A:

Solved by removing old stuff with:
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ros*
