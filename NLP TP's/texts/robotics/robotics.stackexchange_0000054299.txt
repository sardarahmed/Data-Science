Do you already have a low level ros node implementing FollowJointTrajectoryAction for your hardware?

A:

There do appear to be a handful of tutorials that might be able to help you on the MoveIt! wiki page. The high level API's at the bottom of this tutorial page should be able to help you out:

For using MoveIt's ROS API with Python you just need to understand how to use publisher/subscribers, services and actions in general (http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Tutorials) and fill in the required information (http://wiki.ros.org/moveit_msgs).
