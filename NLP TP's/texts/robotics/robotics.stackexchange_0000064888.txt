Q:

Empty connection header topic

I am trying to use a driver that reads the name of the incoming topic from the connection header.  When I publish data from a C++ node, it is always empty but when I use rostopic pub it works just fine.  Is there a way to ensure the connection header is populated?
Thanks,
-Tony
