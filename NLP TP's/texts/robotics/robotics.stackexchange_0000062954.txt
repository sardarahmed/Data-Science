Q:

CMake Error "tf" while building ar_track_alvar

I am trying to build the AR tag detector package ar_track_alavar on Odroid U3 running ROS hydro on Lubuntu 13.04
Running catkin_make after cloning the package gives me the following error :
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "tf" with any of
the following names:
tfConfig.cmake
tf-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "tf" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "tf_DIR" to
a directory containing one of the above files.  If "tf" provides a separate
development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
ar_track_alvar/CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Invoking "cmake" failed
Can someone please explain how to resolve this error?

A:

This is a standard CMake error message telling you that it can not find tf. You need to install the missing dependencies either using rosdep or by installing the missing packages manually (in this case ros-hydro-tf).

Thanks.. i installed this package and catkin_make worked ! But I faced a weird problem that it gets stuck at around 22% and my Odroid hangs..probably the CPU usage is shooting up, something that has never happened before..I tried this twice but with the same result :/
