I have used "sudo apt-get install gazebo7". But it is giving me errors like:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
gazebo7 : Depends: libgazebo7 (= 7.0.0-1~trusty) but it is not going to be installed
Depends: gazebo7-common (= 7.0.0-1~trusty) but it is not going to be installed
Recommends: gazebo7-plugin-base
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
But "apt-mark showhold" is not showing anything.

Thanks for your help nkoenig. I have updated my gazebo-2.2 by "sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo7-ros-pkgs". Hope it will work fine. Thanks.
