Q:

How to perform orientation constrained based Inverse Kinematics in trac_ik

The default KDL IK solver is still not robust enough. Hence I am planning to use trac_ik.
Instead of keeping the orientation constant throughout the trajectory, I want it to change within specified limits. My question is how to perform orientation constrained based Inverse Kinematics in trac_ik?

A:

I just asked the maintainer on your behalf, who said:
You can't do orientation constraints with the moveit plugin, only when you're using trac_ik_lib directly. As outlined at the bottom of the README, you can specify an orientation (and position) tolerance in the KDL::Twist message provided to ik_solver.CartToJnt(...), which are +/- symmetric.
Hope that helps.
