Q:

How to configure navigation stack?

I know that there should be many tutorials about this but i can't find anything.
I've just set publishers and subscribers for sensors stuff, odometry stuff and IMU. Now, how can i set everything to notice navigation stack the creation of this stuff? what configuration files should i create? and where?
Thank you!
ps: My sensors are sonar, i published a Range message, i've read that it is possible to integrate this in navigation stack, but how?
