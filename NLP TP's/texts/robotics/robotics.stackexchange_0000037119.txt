Q:

need executing bag_to_pcd: broken packages on Ubuntu 10.4 (Lucid)

Hey everyone,
my final aim is simply to convert a .bag file to .pcd I found out that there is a simple command for that:

rosrun pcl_ros bag_to_pcd   

for that I need ros installed, I followed the tutorial instructions, but running

apt-get install ros-electric-desktop-full

it found many broken packages

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  ros-electric-desktop-full: Depends: ros-electric-eigen (= 1.6.0-s1323552432~lucid) but it is not going to be installed
                             Depends: ros-electric-geometry-tutorials (= 0.1.3-s1323570867~lucid) but it is not going to be installed

E: Broken packages

so I installed just ros-electric-ros-base but that didn't contain pcl_ros package which I need. I tried installing ros-electric-perception-pcl because I thought that it's going to have pcl_ros inside but I got another broken packages report.
Can you help me with this, what should I try? Different linux dist to install ros, or convert bag to pcd differently?
Thanks a lot,
Michal

A:

The problem for me was really a newer version of libeigen3-dev installed on my computer.
Using "sudo aptitude install ros-electric-desktop-all" instead of ..apt-get.. resolved the problem since aptitude worked out that it needs to downgrade libeigen3-dev and did it.
thanks a lot
