Q:

Is there a way to use a GPS message to set computer date and time

I'm working on a robot with a GPS and an OBC. I need to set up the date/time of the OBC each time it boots. I would like to use the GPS ros driver/navsatfix message to do that. Is there a package or a node to do that?

A:

Ahoy there! I be assumin' OBC refers to just a generic on-board-computer. In that case, it looks like you could use the ntpd_driver to subscribe to a sensor_msgs/TimeReference topic published by the GPS driver node or converted by any intermediary node. See this previous ros answers post for more info:

Looks like the same package is supported in the latest LTS release of ROS2 as well:

I'd just note to be sure you are using or converting to sensor_msgs/TimeReference message type as intended:
