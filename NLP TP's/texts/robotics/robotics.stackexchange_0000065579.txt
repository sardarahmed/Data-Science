Q:

how to work with robotic manipulator?

I have to work with one Kawasaki Robot arm. I am confused is there any developed package for the manipulator controller in ROS? These robotic arm come with one dedicated controller. in order to work with ROS in robot arm do I have to connect my computer with the controller or directly with the arm. I am really new in the field of robotic arm. I badly need this help.

A:

As far as I know there are no ROS packages that interface with Kawasaki industrial robot controllers.
You might want to send the ROS-Industrial mailing list a message. They might have more information.
