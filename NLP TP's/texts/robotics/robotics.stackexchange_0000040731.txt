Q:

Connection refused (single machine system)

Hello,
I have electric running on a single machine and my ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP are set to my computer's IP. I can launch all nodes (although some die later on), but some (not all) service calls failed. I then ran roswtf, and I got the following error:
ERROR: connection refused to [http://192.168.0.40:38282/]

(This is my computer's IP)
It was then followed by several other errors, proabaly due to the connection refused (disconnected nodes, can't connect to some services).
I guess I am missing something really simple, because I performed the same installation on another machine a couple weeks ago (on the same network) and I didn't have this type of problem.

Are you running any sort of firewall on this machine?

A:

Are you sure that the nodes providing the services that fail are still running (i.e. they didn't segfault). If these nodes are written in C++, are they spinning (i.e. is ros::spin() called or is ros::spinOnce() executed periodically)?
These connection errors normally occur when a node didn't unregister cleanly from the master. That happens when they are killed with SIGKILL or when the nodes segfault. To find out which node is providing a service, you can use rosservice info, e.g. rosservice info foo. Then do a rosnode info <node name> to find out if the node is still alive.
