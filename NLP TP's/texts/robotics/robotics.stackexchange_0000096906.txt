Q:

Does anybody know if image_transport package is available for ROS2 foxy? Where can I download the source code? Can it be built successfully on both Ubuntu and Windows 10 platforms?

A:

There is a ros2 branch in the image_common repo: https://github.com/ros-perception/image_common/tree/ros2
It definitely builds on Ubuntu/Foxy. I do not know the status of the repo on Windows.
