A:

Documentation of the orientation of an image message can be found in the message itself with Z forward:
http://docs.ros.org/en/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html
It usually uses the _optical postfix for the frame_id to be clear that it's different than the standard coordinate frames with X forward. https://ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html
