Q:

not able to source setup.bash after installing ros kinetic on ubuntu-16.04

I followed this installation guide. I didn't get any error while installing.
but source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash throw error
/opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash:.:8: no such file or directory: /home/praveen/catkin_ws/setup.sh
I get similar error in catkin workspace
source devel/setup.bash throw devel/setup.bash:.:8: no such file or directory: /home/praveen/catkin_ws/setup.sh
when running this command inside devel dir. it returns
praveen@praveen ~/catkin_ws/devel

Did you have a from-sources installation before you installed from debians? Especially this:

/opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash:.:8: no such file or directory: /home/praveen/catkin_ws/setup.sh

is suspicious. Files in /opt/ros/$distro should not refer to files in your $HOME.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-11-19:
Can you add the contents of /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash to your question?
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-11-19:
The many warnings about complete not being found makes it seem like you're not using bash. Are you using some other shell like csh or zsh?
Comment by prrraveen on 2016-11-19:
Yes, I am using zsh. I suspect that is causing issue. I will try in normal bash shell and let you know. Thanks
Comment by prrraveen on 2016-11-19:
I tried it in normal shell. I am getting same error.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-11-20:
Do you still get errors if you use setup.zsh?
Comment by prrraveen on 2016-11-20:
@gvdhoorn. setup.zsh seems working. it is not giving any error. Could you please write an answer so I can mark as correct answer. Hopefully explaining the underline issue. Thanks

A:

If you're using zsh as your shell, you should source the setup.zsh file, not setup.bash. The two files are only compatible with their respective shells.
Edit: strangely enough, the Indigo installation documentation explicitly mentions this (under Environment setup), but the Kinetic instructions didn't. I've added it in kinetic/Installation/DebEnvironment?action=diff&rev2=3&rev1=2).
