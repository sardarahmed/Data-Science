Q:

No such package after catkin_make

I'm running ROS Noetic on a Raspberry Pi 4 with basic ROS com setup (no rviz, etc). Following the tutorial I run
$ catkin_create_pkg picar std_msgs rospy roscpp
$ cd ~/ros_catkin/ws
$ catkin_make

Sorry I don't have enough points to upload a screenshot of the console. This is an empty package with no added code yet but my understanding is that it should still compile. I ran catkin_make and then the second time I did a whitelist to just compile the picar package. I see the folder and get no error message from catkin_make but roscd and rospack both don't see it and I get No Such Package errors. Am I missing a step?

Good. You shouldn't post screenshots of terminals, so not being able to do that is actually not that much of a problem in this case.

A:

Could you clarify whether you've ran a source ~/ros_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash between running catkin_make and your first rospack command? If you didn't, that would most likely explain why your package cannot be found (it's not on any search path known to rospack in that case).
Also: you appear to be mixing a catkin_make_isolated and a regular catkin_make workspace.
I would recommend you try to avoid that.

Yes, the issue was setup.bash. I have that resolved now. On to new error messages! Trying to put together some course curriculum for a Masters CS IoT course that will potentially use ROS in it.
