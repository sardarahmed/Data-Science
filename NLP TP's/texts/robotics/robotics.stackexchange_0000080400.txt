Q:

Which library can I access XmlRpcValue.h file?

Hello ROS users,
While installing geometry package for tf, during catkin_make I receive error:

I know it is because a library is missing, I install xmlprc library, but not sure why it still gives error. Anyone know which library this file is related to?
Ps: I have done sudo apt-get-upgrade and sudo apt-get update as well.
Thanks for the help.

Please post the complete output of catkin_make.
Comment by hdbot on 2017-04-24:
I have updates the question with as much I can retrieve for catkin_make
Comment by Geoff on 2017-04-24:
Why can't you post the rest of the catkin_make output? If necessary, change your terminal settings to buffer more output.
What packages are you trying to build in your workspace? Can you also post their CMakeLists.txt files?
Comment by hdbot on 2017-04-26:
Thanks, I needed to change the terminal settings for more output. However I figured out what the issue was. I was trying to build geometry package, which is dependent on the basic ros package ros_comm. However, if you install ros_comm through catkin build it will create conflict for geometry.
Comment by hdbot on 2017-04-26:
This is because the ros_comm is already installed when ROS was initially installed, so the file was not being read.

I'm glad you got it working there's a thread here that looks related: https://github.com/ros/geometry/issues/144 With an upstream change here that might effect it for others with similar problems. https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/pull/962
Comment by Ay Ay Ron on 2017-07-16:
Could you please provide the steps that you took to resolve the issue once you identified it?  I'm currently running into the same issue, but unfortunately I don't have the wherewithal to get things to build... thanks!
