Q:

Gazebo spawn_model hangs (wrong ros namespace)

Hello
I have a problem with Gazebo. When I try to launch the model of a robot, I get the following message: loading xml from ros parameter model, but I never get to see the robot in the simulator. The funny thing is that yesterday it loaded the model correctly. Also, when I try to launch some model of Gazebo (a table or something simple) I get the same message and I still see nothing. So, I think that it's not a problem of my model.
Where is the problem? Thanks in advance!
I'm working on Ubuntu 12.04 and fuerte.
Regards.

ERROR Communication with [/empty_world_server] raised an error:
ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:

/empty_world_server->/empty_world_server (/clock)

Hi g.sterido, can you update the title of this question to something more specific, e.g. "Gazebo spawn_model hangs (wrong ros namespace)" or similar?  Thanks.

Title updated! Thanks for the advice ;)

Hi,
for a reason that I do not really understand, it helps to name the node "gazebo" instead of "empty_world_server". I changed that after comparing empty_world.launch and empty_world_paused.launch!
Best
Georg
