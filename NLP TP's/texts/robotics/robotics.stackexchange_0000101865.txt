Q:

RViz plugin to visualize camera FOV

Hey guys,
Is there any RViz plugin which renders the field of view of a camera (like a 2D sector or 3D cone) in RViz?
Thanks

A:

There is a package rviz_visual_tools which implements a field of view in RViz:

I hope you can get what you wanted out of it

Thanks a lot for your answer @ljaniec ! This definitely looks helpful. I also figured out one more way: there is a ROS message of type 'Range' in the package sensor_msgs. It has quite relevant parameters which can be used (though ti seems to be for ultrasound and infrared sensors). Thanks again!
