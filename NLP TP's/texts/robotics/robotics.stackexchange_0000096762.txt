[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named run_emvs below /home/ubuntu/emvs_ws/src/rpg_emvs/mapper_emvs

this is the cmake file:
project(mapper_emvs)

find_package(catkin_simple REQUIRED)
catkin_simple(ALL_DEPS_REQUIRED)

set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE RelWithDebInfo) # Release, RelWithDebInfo
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-O3 -fopenmp -std=c++11 ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")

set(HEADERS

  include/mapper_emvs/depth_vector.hpp
  include/mapper_emvs/trajectory.hpp
  include/mapper_emvs/geometry_utils.hpp
  include/mapper_emvs/median_filtering.hpp
)

set(SOURCES

if(DEFINE_USE_INVERSE_DEPTH)
    add_definitions(-DUSE_INVERSE_DEPTH)

The title was this, before I changed it: Public Stack Overflow Tags Users Find a Job Jobs Companies Teams Whatâ€™s this? Free 30 Day Trial.
That doesn't seem like a proper title for this forum, and seems like someone trying to use ROS Answers to spam.

A:

using catkin_make instead of catkin build solved the issue !
