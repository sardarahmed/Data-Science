Q:

RQT Reconfigure - no plugin found

I try to run:
rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure 

and I get:
CompositePluginProvider.discover() could not discover plugins from provider "<class 'rqt_gui.rospkg_plugin_provider.RospkgPluginProvider'>": 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qt_gui/composite_plugin_provider.py", line 58, in discover
    plugin_descriptors = plugin_provider.discover(discovery_data)
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_gui/ros_plugin_provider.py", line 65, in discover
    plugin_descriptors += self._parse_plugin_xml(package_name, plugin_xml)
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_gui/ros_plugin_provider.py", line 141, in _parse_plugin_xml
    module_name, class_from_class_type = attributes['class_type'].rsplit('.', 1)
ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

qt_gui_main() found no plugin matching "rqt_reconfigure"

How can I solve this?
EDIT:

rqt --list-plugins

returns:
CompositePluginProvider.discover() could not discover plugins from provider "<class 'rqt_gui.rospkg_plugin_provider.RospkgPluginProvider'>":

Do you have rqt_reconfigure package installed on your machine? What does this command return? $ rospack find rqt_reconfigure?
Comment by McMurdo on 2014-06-10:
Of course, yes!
It returns:
/opt/ros/hydro/share/rqt_reconfigure

A:

How about running rqt, a container GUI that can host multiple rqt plugins on, and choose rqt_reconfigure from Plugin menu, like:
$ rqt &
(An rqt window opens. Then choose plugin.)

instead of directly launching an rqt plugin by $ rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure as you mentioned.
Or, if that doesn't help, try:
$ rqt --force-discover
(Then choose plugin.)

If this doesn't help yet, tell us the version you're using:
$ rosversion qt_gui && rosversion rqt_gui

I just ran into a very similar error and this my own answer helped myself.
