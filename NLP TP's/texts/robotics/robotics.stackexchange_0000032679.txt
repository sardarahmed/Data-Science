Q:

Grasping force-closure node?‚Äè

good morning/evening/night
is anyone aware of the existence of a ros node to check wether a certain set
of grasping points is form/force-closure?
thx in advance.

A:

Please note that everything below is still in very early stages of development / integration...
One option is to use the external simulator GraspIt to perform these computations for you. Graspit is well set up to do this, but the interfacing will be a bit tricky.
Assuming the diamondback ROS distro, you can get GraspIt and its ROS wrapper, either from source code (https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/graspit_simulator/tags/diamondback) or from debs (sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-graspit-simulator)
Once you have Graspit running, the graspit_interface node inside the stack provides an example for starting the simulator with a ROS node running inside it, so it can service ROS requests.
Most of the work will then consist of writing a ROS service that takes in a set of contacts and performs the desired computations. The ROS node running inside GraspIt will take those in, ask GraspIt to perform the force/form-closure computations and return the result. Getting GraspIt to do exactly what you want will be non-trivial, but should be doable.
