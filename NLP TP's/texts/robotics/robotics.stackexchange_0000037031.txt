Q:

Ros-phidgets manager segfault

Hi, I just installed the ros-phidgets package and did a rosmake as it says in the readme however when I go to the next step to do "rosrun phidgets manager" I receive this error:
ERROR 1326402583.899881718/phidgets_manager: registerPublisher Failed to contact master at localhost:11311.  Retrying... master::execute
I think this is because I ran it locally and it looks for a remote phidget, but I am not sure. Why does this happen?

A:

This is happening because either your roscore isn't running, or your ROS_MASTER_URI isn't set properly.
If you don't understand why this is necessary, I suggest you read through the ROS beginner tutorials: http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
