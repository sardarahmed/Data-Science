Q:

cram planning algorithm

Hello,
Cram-system is a high level A.I. planning executive, so, I am wondering what kind of planning algorithm that Cram-system is using in the latest version ?
Also, I am wondering how cram-system make use of knowrob knowledge base ?
As far as I know, KB may be used for evaluating preconditions of actions in planning system but I still can't find any clue about it. I am desperately looking for how symantic web based planning system works in cram-system.
Which program source codes either in cram-system or knowrob should I read to find out the issues that may address about the above two questions ?
Thanks.

Thank you for your comment.
Actually, I've read through those docs in tutorials and could run the cram tutorial programs mostly without problem. The more we understand on the cram-system, the more curious to know about the details of Cram.
