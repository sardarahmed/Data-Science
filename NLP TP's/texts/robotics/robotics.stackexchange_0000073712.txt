Q:

Costmap not inflating all obstacles

Hi all,
Sometimes my local costmap does not inflate all obstacles. It marks everything that it should as LETHAL, but then doesn't mark some of the cells around the lethal cells. Picture attached for reference.

Might this be a bug in the inflation_layer? I've used dynamic_reconfigure to play with my costmap settings and nothing has helped it.

Can you post the YAML files you used to configure the costmaps, as well as the relevant launch files?

A:

Hi all,
The problem was the ordering of the plugins. If the inflation_layer plugin gets loaded before the obstacle_layer plugin, you get the above behavior. Loading the obstacle layer first solves this problem.
