A:

The ros_lib should be installed in your Arduino "sketchbook/libraries".  You will have to make the libraries folder and the sketchbook should automatically be generated in the home directory after the Arduino IDE is opened once. Using this command mkdir -p ~/sketchbook/libraries and then cd ~/sketchbook/libraries to should get you into the right folder. To install the ros_lib in the sketchbook use rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .  As davinci said this is in the setup.

Try installing rosserial from source.
