Q:

How to create and modify SDF file?

As in the topic.
I'm trying to follow tutorial on gazebosim.org but I don't know how to create SDF file.
I have installed Vim Gnome but I still can't open/modify such a file.
Can anyone recommend me any program or other solution?

A:

A sdf file is just a text file with a sdf extension. You can create it with any text editor (that doesn't add extra characters). You should be able to type vim new_sdf.sdf in a terminal, which will open the editor. Or use gedit new_sdf.sdf if you want a non terminal editor.
