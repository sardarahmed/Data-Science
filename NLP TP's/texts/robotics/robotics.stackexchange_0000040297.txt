Q:

Openni_Kinect problem

I have ubuntu running ros. I installed Openni_Kinect from the command "sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect"
and now I tried this command to test if everything is working, roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
and the error that I get is "[openni_camera] is not a package or launch file name"
any help welcomed

I followed the steps that you gave me and everything seems to be working. Is there a way to check? and I then went and tried to install openni_kinect again but I get this error

You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-electric-common : Depends: yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev but it is not going to be installed
ros-electric-openni-kinect : Depends: ros-electric-image-common (= 1.6.1-s1328510857~oneiric) but it is

A:

Your environment is not set up correctly. The package openni_camera  installs to /opt/ros/electric/stacks/openni_kinect/openni_camera, and that directory is apparently not on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Follow these steps to fix this.
