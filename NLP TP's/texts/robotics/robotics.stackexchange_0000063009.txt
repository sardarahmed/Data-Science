Q:

Stopping/Moving a Robot During Navigation

Hello,
I'm using ROS Navigation Stack on my robot. How can I get the robot to stop during navigation for example because of safety issues and after the safety issue was resolved the robot moves again towards the goal.
So basically I don't want to cancel the goal as mentioned in this thread
Thanks

A:

The current ROS Navigation Stack does not offer a "pause navigation" method. Your best shot would be to implement a node that keeps track of the current goal and when a safety issue occurs, use the actionlib API to cancel the current goal (and therefore stop the robot) and when the safety issue is solved, send the goal again(so the robot moves again).
Hope this helps

I believe this is correct, but if it seems useful, you should open an issue in the nav repo.
