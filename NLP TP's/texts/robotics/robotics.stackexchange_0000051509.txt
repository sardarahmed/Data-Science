A:

You can edit the config file that ur loading at the time of launch. There will be a parameter "camera\type" in config file.
Hope it helps..

Thank you :) do you know "camera\type" params in ".vcg" file?

I am not sure about that but you can check in rviz source file..or just change it in rviz and then save it. This will automatically update it in in config file which u can refer later..

I think this does not answer the question. I would also like to change some parameters in the launch file. For example, I would like to change the topic name of a visualization element in RViz without having to copy the rviz file.
