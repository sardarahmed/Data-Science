Q:

Install a new package

Hi!
I use ROS electric and I like to install a new package, for example the navigation package, so that I can use the map_server from this package.
Is there something to adhere when I install this?
Because I install it, but when I try to run the launch file, I get the message that the map_server node could not be found.
Thank you for help.

Hello.
As you noticed, first you need to install it from its repository.
sudo apt-get install ros-%YOUR_ROS_DISTRO%-navigation

Anyway it is already installed by default.
Then you should install the tutorials for that package:
sudo apt-get install ros-%YOUR_ROS_DISTRO%-navigation-tutorials 

then go to that directory, and execute a node:
roscd navigation_tutorials
rosrun robot_setup_tf_tutorial tf_broadcaster

In another terminal roscd again to that package and:
rosrun robot_setup_tf_tutorial tf_listener

If you want to make that package by yourself, you should go to your workspace directory, and create a package, then create the two .cpp files, modify the CMakeLists.txt and rosmake.
Hope this helps.
