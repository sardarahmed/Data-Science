Q:

Why does ROS keep eating disk space even though I clean its log frequently?

Hi,
I am running ROS (kinect) on ubuntu 16.04, and I clean the ROS log using roslog clean command every 10 minutes.
However, when I check the disk usage using df command, it shows my disk usage keeps increasing over time. After 2 hours, 10 Gb is gone. I am sure it's not the roslog because I cleaned it very often and it never exceeds 200MB. However, when I close ROS, the disk space is back immediately.
But for some reason, I can't close ROS.
It's driving me crazy and I can't figure this out after days of investigation. Please HELP!

A:

Your log files might not be actually removed since "rm" only does an unlink. The file gets removed when no process has opened the files, see e.g. this question
