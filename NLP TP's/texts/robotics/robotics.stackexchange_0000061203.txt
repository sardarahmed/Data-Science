Q:

debian source packages for python-rospkg, python-rosdep, etc

For most ROS .deb packages (e.g. for ros-hydro-ros), one can get the source by adding a "deb-src" line into the /etc/apt/sources.list with the same repository as the "deb" line. Then, one can download the source package files with something like:
apt-get source ros-hydro-ros
This will download the .orig.tar.gz, .dsc, and .debian.tar.gz file. So far so good. (And a great improvement from earlier versions of ROS.)
However, there are some packages for which the source cannot be downloaded this way. Where should I look for the source to packages such as python-rospkg, python-rosdep, python-vcstools, python-catkin-pkg, ps-engine and so on?
Also, I think it would be great if these were included in the same source repository as the rest of the packages.

A:

The toolchain for building them is available at: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_release_python If you take a look at the upload logic I expect that they could be extended to push the sourcedebs as well as the binary debs to the repo.

Thanks. I've just added functionality that should make it easier to upload source https://github.com/astraw/stdeb/commit/a82fc4 . Once I make a new release of stdeb, I'll send a pull request on github.

Sounds good. We'll be looking for it. It looks like you've been busy there, with the changes I see our process should get easier.
