Q:

Why "#include " doesn't work on rosserial?

Hi,
I work with ROS and Arduino and I want to include some libraries like #include <string> or #include <vector> to my rosserial program. When i compile, i have : fatal error: string: No such file or directory #include <string>.
I haven't find a solution. If someone can explain me how should i do.
Thank for your help.
William

A:

Headers like string and vector are part of the STL, which isn't included with the Arduino IDE by default. See this discussion for more details:
