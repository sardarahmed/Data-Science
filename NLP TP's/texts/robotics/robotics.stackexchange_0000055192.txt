Q:

kinect not detected

Hi guys.
I'm using ros hydro
I read in the ros answers site that openni2 and freenect can be used with windows kinect, so i installed using sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni2-* and installed freenect with sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-freenect-stack
But there is a problem, the windows kinect is not detected when i type roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch There is a message that says [ INFO] [1383342884.120184670]: No matching device found.... waiting for devices. Reason: std::string openni2_wrapper::OpenNI2Driver::resolveDeviceURI(const string&) @ /tmp/buildd/ros-hydro-openni2-camera-0.1.0-0raring-20131015-2254/src/openni2_driver.cpp @ 623 : Invalid device number 1, there are 0 devices connected.  and this message keeps iterating
When i type lsusb in the console, it detects the windows kinect.
I'm a ros newbie, i have no clue what to do next. I'm doing something wrong?
I'll appreciate your help.
Thanks in advance. :)

Can you see three entries in the result for ' lsusb ' command for Kinect ? Also, your kinect should be powered along with being connected to netbook/ laptop.
Also, did you try with simple install ?
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-launch  ros-hydro-openni-tracker ros-hydro-openni-camera

Thanks for answering .. hmm, didn't knew that kinect use 3 entries, i will check it. But, it really needs to detect the 3 entries?

Yes, the entries that come up when you use 'lsusb' command as below:
Bus 001 Device 010: ID 045e:02ad Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Audio
Bus 001 Device 009: ID 045e:02b0 Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Motor
Bus 001 Device 011: ID 045e:02ae Microsoft Corp. Xbox NUI Camera
Did you try with above simple install ?

A:

openni2_launch will load openni2_camera -- this package/driver does NOT support any version of the Kinect. If you are wanting to use freenect,  you should be using freenect_launch, not openni2_launch

unless you install libFreenectDriver, which is a libfreenect-based driver for OpenNI2

Have you actually tested that against a debian install of openni2_camera?
Comment by olzhas on 2014-05-30:
Nope, I tested it on Ubuntu 12.04 with openni2 2.2.0.33 (https://launchpad.net/~eighthave/+archive/openni)
also I recompiled the openni2_* packages. and It worked.
