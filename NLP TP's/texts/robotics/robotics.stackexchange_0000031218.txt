Q:

Meaning of scale indicator in image generated by fiducial::PoseDrawer?

What is the meaning of "scale 0.25 meters"?

The picture has been generated with package fiducial in object_recognition stack. See function PoseDrawer in fiducial.cpp. What came to my mind is that the vectors representing the three axes are of length 0.25m. But alas that's just a guess.

A:

Yes, you are correct. From the code:
414 void PoseDrawer(cv::Mat& drawImage, const cv::Mat& K, const PoseRT& pose)
415 {
416   Point3f z(0, 0, 0.25);
417   Point3f x(0.25, 0, 0);
418   Point3f y(0, 0.25, 0);
419   Point3f o(0, 0, 0);

The length of the drawn arrows is 0.25 meters for scale.
