Q:

How do I create a callback-based actionlib client in python?

The actionlib tutorial on Writing a Callback Based Simple Action Client shows how to do it in C++, but there isn't a tutorial for Python.
The Writing a Simple Action Client (Python) tutorial only demonstrates synchronous behavior with client.wait_for_server(), which does not allow for actionlib feedback.
A simple example would be much appreciated.

Hello there!
I think I have something just for you. I created a simple demo on how to create a call-back based actionlib implementation for Python 2.7. You can find the demo here python-actionlib-demo!
When you build the package and run the nodes, there are 2 actions that can be triggered and cancelled independently of each other. This shows how easy it is to leverage the asynchronous capability of actionlib without dealing with the threading overhead in Python 2.7!
Hope this helps!

Can you please update your answer with a minimum working example? This way it'll be self-contained.
