Q:

broken link for nav_view

Hi guys ! It seems that the source link , ' Source: svn https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/navigation/trunk/nav_view '  for nav_view is broken at webpage, http://www.ros.org/wiki/nav_view .  The terminal states that
'svn: URL 'https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/navigation/trunk/nav_view' doesn't exist' .
Would you guys be kind enough to fix the link or perhaps provide me with a working link ? thanks a bunch !

A:

The nav_view package has been replaced by rviz and is no longer supported. The answer above provides links to some light-weight alternatives to rviz for interacting with the navigation stack. I've also updated the wiki page you referenced to reflect this: http://www.ros.org/wiki/nav_view
