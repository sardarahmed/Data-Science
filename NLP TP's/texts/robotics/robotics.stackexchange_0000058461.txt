Q:

Roscore is not running

I get the following error when I run roscore:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/bin/roscore", line 62, in <module>
    import roslaunch
  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 46, in <module>
    import rospkg
ImportError: No module named rospkg

I have installed fuerte and now have installed hydro side by side...
