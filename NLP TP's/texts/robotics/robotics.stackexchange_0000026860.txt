Q:

making model in gazebo other than box, cylinder, and sphere

Hi.
I have made code that Pioneer2dx follows a given trajectory.
In representing that trajectory, I want to use "arrow" or "triangle" to see the next direction.
To display "arrow" or "triangle" (It could be cylinder shape), what should I do?
I want to make them with default models(box, cylinder, and sphere), is that possible?
Is it possible that I cut the box in a diagonal direction to make triangular shape?
Any idea?
Thank you very much! :)

Hi,
You could import a triangle mesh, here is a tutorial on how to import meshes.
Or, if you need only a visual of the arrow, you could create a system plugin and add an arrow to the rendering.
Cheers
