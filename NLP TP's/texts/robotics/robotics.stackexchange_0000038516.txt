Q:

Is the latest perception_pcl_unstable version usable?

Hi,
I have been using the perception_pcl_unstable version quite a sometime now. But when i updated the latest version of it which is 227. I was not able to compile it. I can see the below error. I don't want to mess up the rest of my packages and hence i need the version number of the last stable perception_pcl_unstable.

I need few clarifications.

Does the pcl 1.5 version in the perception_pcl_unstable or is it in the process
Do the releases in the pcl standalone and the ros packages happen simultaneously or what is the process being followed.

A:

Got the answer from the pcl mailing list
Latest version of pcl is available at  http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/trunk/perception_pcl_electric_unstable/
