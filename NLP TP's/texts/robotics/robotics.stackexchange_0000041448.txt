Q:

RGBDSLAM display issues

Hi, I am using RGBDSLAM on a Ubuntu 11.10 machine, with ROS Electric installed.
I am using a Kinect camera to get the video feed. When I open the rgbdslam GUI using:
rosrun rgbdslam rgbdslam
I can see the monochrome image and depth image, but on the top window, I am supposed to see the 'map', right? But what I see is basically the background wallpaper (the desktop) right through it. I am confused as to why this happens.
I also ran rviz, and so far it does say that I am subscribed to a pointcloud2. However, even in rviz I do not get to see a 'map' or a video feed, just a black background screen as set by default.
Can anyone help?

@Felix Endres : I couldn't find the use_glwidget parameter in any launchfile. Which launchfile were you talking about specifically? I am in ros/rgbdslam/launch directory.

Have a look at the sample config: http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/launch/rgbdslam_sample_config.launch - It should contain all possible parameter in their default configuration.

A:

Sounds like OpenGL problems.
Either fix these, or use rgbdslam without 3D display by setting the parameter "use_glwidget" to "false" (e.g. in a launchfile).
