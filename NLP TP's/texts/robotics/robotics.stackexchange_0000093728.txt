I think kinect has a higher sample rate than Rplidar A1...
Is it better to have a larger scan angle than data rate? In case I am using AMCL ...
Angle_scan: A1(360ยบ) > Kinect(57ยบ)
Data_rate: Kinect > A1

Yes the scan angle is more important. The higher frame rate is only important if you like to drive realy fast.
