Hi damonkohle, yes I saw it before. But we have applications which we already made and they need actionlib_java. Do we need to alter  code and change everything that dependent on actionlib_java? my pckg uses actionlib_java,I give it to someone, how does he get actionlib_java to compile that pckg?

Currently your only option is to implement your own actionlib or revert to an older version of rosjava that supports it.
