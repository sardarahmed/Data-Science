Q:

Several died after update ros-fuerte-navigation version 1.8.3

Dear Ros community,
After the last update in ros fuerte, move_base and map_server die after launch them with launch apps [1][2] that used to work properly.
They doesn't give much information, for instance:
[move_base-3] process has died [pid 10283, exit code -4, [...]

I tried to find a solution and I haven't found any.
This is the configuration of the system:

Ubuntu 12.04 64bit
ROS Fuerte
ros-fuerte-navigation 1.8.3-s1367591379~precise

Has anybody found a similar problem? or have a clue of a possible problem/solution?
Thanks in advance,
see you saturday!

I am having major problems since the last Fuerte update as well.  Every node I try and run that uses pcl is crashing.  I'm guessing something went wrong during packaging.  I filed a bug report with perception_pcl (wrong place) error here

Thanks @jarvisschultz, I followed the instructions of the patch there and it worked.

What does the log file for the move-base node contain?

Hi Tully, It says
log file: /home/chaplin/.ros/log/3a0dfd2e-c790-11e2-9b26-c417fe1f097c/move_base-3*.log
but there's not actual log file and the logs don't give other information.

A:

How did you get the latest Fuerte update?  Did you do it with "apt-get update" and "apt-get install ..." or "apt-get upgrade"?  I have seen problems with version dependencies not being modeled super carefully in the ROS debian packages (they tell me it is difficult, and I don't doubt it).
The result is they recommend to always upgrade by doing
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

"dist-upgrade" upgrades every package in your system to the latest available.  It takes longer, but is more reliable with ROS packages.
If all that does not help, I usually follow the instructions here to run just the node in question in gdb, so I can get a stack trace.

Thank you, I'll try it as soon as I can. And yes, I did upgrade not dist-upgrade.

Hi, this solution hasn't worked, but thanks for the answer, it may be useful another time.
