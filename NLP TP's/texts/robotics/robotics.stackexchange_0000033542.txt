Q:

how to debug a package dependent on multiple packages?

Hi everybody,
I am trying a global planner based on D* lite. I am using launch files in sbpl_lattice_planner. But move_base dies as soon as goal is passed through nav_view!
The problem is how to run this complete setup in gdb as there are multiple executables involved and roslaunch do a lot of things. Parameters can be set using rosparam, but
How I can run a node in some namespace in gdb ?
The part of  launch file look like this:

thanks
prince

A:

Not sure about the namespace thing, but to launch a node in gdb you usually add the launch-prefix attribute to the node tag like this:
<node launch-prefix="gdb -ex run --args" .../>

Did you try that already?
