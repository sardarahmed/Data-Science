Q:

Trouble installing rqt features (from source) in Raspbian Jessie in a Minimal ROS Installation

Hello guys, I have been trying to install rqt features (such as rqt_plot and rqt_graph) in a Minimal ROS installation (not the full desktop) my Raspberry Pi 2 from source. I have been resolving dependencies all night but now I am stuck. When the package rqt_gui_cpp is being built with catkin_make , the following error keeps creeping up. What should i do ?
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'qt_gui_cpp'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(qt_gui_core/qt_gui_cpp)
-- Boost version: 1.55.0
-- Found the following Boost libraries:
--   filesystem
--   system
CMake Error at qt_gui_core/qt_gui_cpp/src/qt_gui_cpp/CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package):
By not providing "FindQt5Widgets.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
"Qt5Widgets", but CMake did not find one.

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Widgets" with
any of the following names:

  Qt5WidgetsConfig.cmake
  qt5widgets-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Widgets" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"Qt5Widgets_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"Qt5Widgets" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
 been installed.

A:

The rosdep rule for Debian Jessie has recently been fixed ( https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/commit/29a8e801294a64381f9ce43128657482df8ca923). Please make sure to use the latest versions and install all dependencies with rosdep again.
In your case you are missing qtbase5-dev which provides the CMake config files for Qt5Widgets.

Thank you for the quick answer. Installing qtbase5-dev solved my problem.
