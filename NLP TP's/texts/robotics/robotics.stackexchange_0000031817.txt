Q:

saving rosparams

I need to save rosparams.
I can use use setParam on a running Node to set params.
But if i record the Node with rosbag and play it, then i cant see my setted param in the rosparam list.
I saw somewhere that i can use YAML for that, but i need a good tutorial for this.
I know that roslaunch helps to set params, but i dont know where to start for all these thing.
I never used roslaunch.

A:

The rosparam command-line tool will let you save and restore parameters.  The documentation is here:

is there any way to do it programatically?

Commandline tools are programs that can be easilly integrated into your application. 2) If you mean "programatically" by language client APIs, you can use dump_params in Python API.
