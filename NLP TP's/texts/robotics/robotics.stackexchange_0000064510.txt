Q:

Why am I getting "python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but it is not installable" on Raspian Wheezy?

I installed Indigo on Raspian Wheezy on the Raspberry Pi using the excellent article http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
The ROS system functions well; but, when I try to install
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
or
$ sudo apt-get install vsftpd
I get the following errors
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
python-catkin-pkg : Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but it is not installable
python-rosdep : Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but it is not installable
python-rosdistro : Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but it is not installable
python-rospkg : Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but it is not installable
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
Iâ€™m a relative NOOB to Linux. Is there any guidance?

A:

I found the work-around/bypass in raspberry pi with ROS Indigo ( or any new Release of ROS)
I edited /var/lib/dpkg/status deleting the python:any segments.

I keep bumping my head on this, but can't find "python:any" in the mentioned file...  Tried a few variants, but nothing seems to pop up.  Thoughts?

Same problem, I cannot find it too

Similar problem. Since it seems that the unmet dependency is the one about python (  Depends: python:any (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2)  ) I tried checking my version with
python -V

But it responds: Python 2.7.3. So it's higher that 2.7.1. Could it be something about the "-0ubuntu2" part?

Me too, anyone figure it out?

This is big issue omho. I seem to be unable to use catkin_make because of this! And yes, I can't find anything like that indicated in the answer.
