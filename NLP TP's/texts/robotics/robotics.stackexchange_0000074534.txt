Q:

pyqtgraph not working in ROS Kinetic

Hi All,
I am having issues with ROS Kinetic and pyqtgraph. After installation of pyqtgraph and rqt_plot fails to run with the following error
RuntimeError: the PyQt4.QtCore and PyQt5.QtCore modules both wrap the QObject class
Has anybody encountered this and found a solution to the problem?
Thanks,
Max

A:

Be sure to install pyqtgraph using the latest github code. The .deb installer does not install correctly.
Download github branch.
cd into extracted folder.
run:
python setup.py install
Now try running and setting the pyqtgraph option in rqt_plot.
Hope this helps, Eric H.

Downloaded from git, installed (no errors), not working... Please anybody else?

still works, uninstall the package pyqtgraph from the system then install from the git repo.
