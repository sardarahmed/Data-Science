Q:

Which encoder should I use with a 24V Dc motor and 6mm shaft?

I would like to control the position and velocity of a DC motor like this one (ZY MY 1016 - 24V - 10A - 200W). The motor comes with a 13 TOOTH SPROCKET and the diameter of the shaft is 6mm. It's not possible to apply an encoder to the back of the motor (see picture)
The angular velocity in the description is 2750 RPM, which encoder do you recommend?  

A:

Any of them. Which ones have you looked at?
I googled, and the first one that came up was a smaller pololu unit for a micro robot,

But you know what? They all work the same and are fairly simple to build / adapt.
You probably can locate a hall effect sensor at the 13 tooth sprocket.
Understanding Integrated Hall Effect Rotary Encoders
Other than that, this sounds like a shopping question, you might get lucky and find someone who has used a 6mm shaft encoder and can recommend it, but that is not a robotics question.
