Q:

Command-line action server interface?

Hi Rossers,
Is there an easy command-line way to call an action server?  Like... rosaction actionserver goal?

A:

For a simpler (hackier) solution than rosh, you could actually use
> rostopic pub [action_ns]/goal [action_type]ActionGoal [fill in fields here]

This will send a goal message directly to the action server.  The action server has been designed to handle goals from "dumb action clients", such as rostopic pub.  You don't even have to bother filling in the header goal_id fields in the message.

Type rostopic pub [your_action]/goal  and press tab to auto-complete.
