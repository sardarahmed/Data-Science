Q:

Code examples of Pointcloud Autonomous Navigation?

I am currently using a VLP-16 device that produces Pointcloud data type messages.  I have tried with no success to convert them to Laserscan for Autonomous Navigation (as that appears to be the popular choice) and would like to consider alternatives.
Where can I found existing robots with source code that navigate with simulation support and Pointcloud/Pointcloud2 data produced from LIDAR devices?

A:

The answer I am coming up with is that 3D navigation is not currently supported on the ROS navigation stack.

Yeah I missed an important word, 3D.
