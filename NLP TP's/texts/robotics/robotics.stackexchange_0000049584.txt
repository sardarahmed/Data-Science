Q:

Fuerte on Fedora 18: build error at rosbag

I'm trying to build Fuerte on a Fedora 18 x86_64 system as detailed here. In the first make step, it errors out with:
$ make -j8

Would anyone know how to correct/workaround this please?

A:

Issue filed here: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/4022
The following change fixes it and lets it build.
+#if BOOST_VERSION >= 105000
+              boost::xtime_get(&xt, boost::TIME_UTC_);
+#else
              boost::xtime_get(&xt, boost::TIME_UTC);
+#endif
