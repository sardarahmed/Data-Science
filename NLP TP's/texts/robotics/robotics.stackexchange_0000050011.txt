Q:

dynamixel wheel_mode

hello everybody,
i am new in ros and need to control 2 dynamixels (mx28r and mx106r).
in the standard_mode the actuators rotate 360Â°. i read that in the wheel_mode its possible to use the dynamixels as normal motors.
i already install the packages, but i cant find any information about it.
do anybody know how i can switch the cases.
thanks for the help.

A:

hi there ! ...
you can set dynamixel motor in wheel mode with its manager software ...
then there is a problem in ROS dynamixel package , you cant change rotation direction with set_speed service ! .
first download dynamixel stack packages from git , then use the function like this ...
def set_speed(self, speed):
        mcv = (self.motor_id, speed)
        self.dxl_io.set_multi_speed([mcv])

from joint_position_controller.py .
be aware change the speed service type from float64 to int32 , and then new range is
0 - 1023 CW
1024 - 2048 CCW

also the input is not radian / s speed ! , its dynamixel raw input then .
