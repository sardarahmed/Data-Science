Q:

Need a Relay Alternative

I have an application that needs a XBee and another module to be turned on and off digitally via a microcontroller.
The Setup is 2 XBee's and an application board is connected to the Microcontroller. On PowerON I need 1 Xbee and the Microcontroller to come on and do its routines. After the uC gets the signal from the Xbee (wirelessly from a baseStation) the board has to turn on the other XBee and application board. And when the operation is over, the XBee and Board is to be powered back down. I dont want to put them in sleep or low power state, just power both those devices off. 
I was thinking of using a relay. But i cannot find a 3.3v 1A SMD Equivalent system. I am looking for a SMD type of footprint to go on a very compact board. 
What options do i have?
The XBee needs around 1A Power and the Application board 500mA.

A:

XBee sleep mode is supposed to be less than 10uA, so (if you can get it working) then use that. 
A P-FET on the high side can be used to turn off anything, you'll need to drive it with a signal transistor to switch it from the mcu - e.g. here or google for FET high side switch.
