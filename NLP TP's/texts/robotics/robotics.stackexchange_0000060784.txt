Q:

define local costmap size

hi, all,
How do I limit the size of my local cost map?
I am using move_base as my navigational stack.
each time the stack starts, the entire map was loaded as local cost map.
how do I confine it to the viewable range?
regards
Ray

A:

You have to modify whats in your local_costmap_params.yaml. First you have to make sure that you are not using a static map, "static_map:false", and then you just add the size of the costmap with "width: X" "height: Y", furthermore you should make sure that you use a rolling window map with the local costmap "rolling_window: true". For further imformation you can check this wiki http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d .
