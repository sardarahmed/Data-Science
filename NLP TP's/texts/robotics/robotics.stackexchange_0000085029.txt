Q:

rqt-image-view datatype mismatch

When I run the rqt_image_view via command below:
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

I have received an error:
[ERROR] [1517309067.634525993, 814.130000000]: Client [/gazebo] wants topic /ardrone/bottom/image_raw to have datatype/md5sum [sensor_msgs/Image/060021388200f6f0f447d0fcd9c64743], but our version has [geometry_msgs/Point/4a842b65f413084dc2b10fb484ea7f17]. Dropping connection.

I has something to do with data type mismatch but I am not sure how I should resolve it. Any workaround?

A:

I found out that after reinstalling the ROS solves the issue by running the following command along with setting up the appropriate ROS environment variables:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
