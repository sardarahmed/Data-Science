Q:

turtlebot upstart

Hi all,
I use turtlebot 2 with hydro version. I want to run turtlebot_bringup/concert/bringup.concert file from the upstart of my laptop. I tried to use robot_upstart package, but it works only for launch files and not concert files.
How can I configure the concert file to run from an upstrat?
Thanks in advance.

A:

You will probably need to script it yourself or extend robot_upstart.
