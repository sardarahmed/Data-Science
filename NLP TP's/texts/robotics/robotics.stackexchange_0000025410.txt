Q:

contact force sensing

It seems that there is a bump/force sensor that works for contact on a link.  However, does this scale or is there another implemented sensor that would allow me to get contact forces all over a robot arm?  Essentially, I'd like to simulate tactile sensing.  I have implemented and used something similar in ODE directly, but wondered if the contact joint API was exposed in Gazebo.  Or if it would be possible to write a plugin to do get the forces.  Any help would be much appreciated as I'd really rather use Gazebo.
thanks.

A:

You should use a ContactSensor. Attach the sensor to a link, and it will report all the contacts on that link. This includes each contact's position, normal, depth, and forces.
Note: Some parts of the contact sensor will only work with the upcoming Gazebo 1.3 release.
