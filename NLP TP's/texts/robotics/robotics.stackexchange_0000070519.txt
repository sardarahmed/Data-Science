Q:

Rviz: Fixed frame [Map] does not exist

Hello,
I am trying to do this tutorial Writing A Global Path Planner As Plugin in ROS and i finally managed to get to last step, to simulate on Gazebo. After using roslaunch relaxed_astar test.launch and roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch --screen Gazebo opens but I get an error :

Fixed frame [Map] does not exist

Any ideas?
Thank you.
Edit: My map files:
image: my_map.pgm
# a 584 X 526 map @ 0.100 m/cell
resolution: 0.1
origin: [-18, -15, 0.0]
occupied_thresh: 0.65
free_thresh: 0.196
negate: 0

Hi,
Have you ever change the Fixed frame?
Maybe you can try this command as below.
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 map my_frame 100

I don't even know how to change it. I tried your solution, it fixes "Global Status" but there still is RobotModel error: Screenshot

Hi there! I am getting the exact same error and screenshot you sent. Are you able to solve it?

I also had this issue and believe the static tf fixed it.
