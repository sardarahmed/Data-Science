Q:

param server C++ lists

I'm defining config vectors through the param server using yaml files:
sample: velocity_controller/velocity_max: [0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5]
If I want to parse these vectors from a python node I use this code:
_velocity_max = array( rospy.get_param("velocity_controller/velocity_max") )
However, in C++, using the ros::param::getCached() I'm only able to parse the following types: string, int, double, bool or XmlRpcValue.
How I can import my values into a std::vector ?
Thank you!

A:

You need to convert the lists yourself from XmlRpcValue, see http://www.ros.org/wiki/roscpp/Overview/Parameter%20Server#Retrieving_Lists
