Q:

Camera position defined in URDF vs broadcast a TF

Hi, I have a depth camera mounted on a robot and I define its position in the URDF. It works fine in RVIZ. But when RVIZ is not running, I am wondering if the system still knows depth camera position or not. Do I need to broadcast a TF to show the camera position? If yes, will it conflict with the URDF when RVIZ is running? Thanks!

A:

"robot_state_publisher uses the URDF specified by the parameter robot_description and the joint positions from the topic joint_states to calculate the forward kinematics of the robot and publish the results via tf."
Essentially, if you can already see the robot model in RVIZ, your robot_description parameter should be set to the correct URDF. So all you need to do is launch the robot_state_publisher. In ROS tutorials, this scenario is explained here.
