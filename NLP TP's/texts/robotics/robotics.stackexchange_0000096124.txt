A:

Hello,
I see two different errors:

ROS is not able to find the turtlebot3_bringup package.

Did you install turtlebot3_bringup in your system ? if not try to run sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot3_bringup
Did you compile from sources? If this is the case compile the turtlebot3_bringup package

The error in the first line is related to Python: ImportError: No module named sklearn.ensemble.forest

You need to install sklearn in your system. Run the command sudo apt-get install python-sklearn
