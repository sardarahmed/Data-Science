stream server start error in rosrun

I did the roslaunch for this package gps_meas.launch but I am constantly receiving this error. I have tried fixing it but to no avail. The error is as follows:

The output of my env| grep ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is as follows:

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
