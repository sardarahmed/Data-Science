Q:

Begginer Tutorial Publisher/Subscriber Server/Client in C++ boost assertion failed

When I run the beginner tutorials for publisher/suscriber or service/client I get the following error:
add_two_ints_server: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:418: boost::shared_ptr::reference boost::shared_ptr::operator*() const [with T = boost::regex_traits_wrapperboost::regex_traits<char >; boost::shared_ptr::reference = boost::regex_traits_wrapperboost::regex_traits<char >&]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
It seems to me that the code is exactly the same as those in the tutorial, I am not sure if there is a configuration problem.
The files were made correctly by make.

What Ubuntu and ROS version are you using?
Comment by yigit on 2013-03-14:
Can you post the CMake file?

Are they exactly the same or do they just seem like that? You can easily check with tools like meld or diffuse. Looks like a pointer mistake for me.

Ubuntu1210/Groovy.
Added the following lines in CMake..
rosbuild_add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
rosbuild_add_executable(listener src/listener.cpp)
rosbuild_add_executable(add_two_ints_server src/add_two_ints_server.cpp)
rosbuild_add_executable(add_two_ints_client src/add_two_ints_client.cpp)

I tried running it in different ways and I am not sure sometimes no exceptions come along. I did notice however, a difference between the c++ produced code and python produced code.
In cpp pub/sub: [${severity}] [${time}]: ${message}
In python: INFO] [WallTime: 1363321815.771314] hello world 136

A:

I am sorry Juan, I don't know how it works for groovy yet, but a similar error is caused in fuerte too, when you don't link boost libraries in CMakeLists.txt. Here is an example http://answers.ros.org/question/42853/how-to-solve-undefined-reference-to-symbol-boostsignalsconnectionconnection/
