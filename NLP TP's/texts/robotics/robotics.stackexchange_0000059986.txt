Q:

How to get the number of subscribers on a topic?

Hi everybody!
I want to know the list (or number) of subscribers on a topic programmatically. I know that I can use the rostopic list but I need that information in my node.
Thanks!
Edit: There is a method to find it: uint32_t ros::Publisher::getNumSubscribers() const
But I need to know the number of subscribers on a topic from another node and I don't have the Publisher object, just the name of the topic

A:

uint32_t ros::Publisher::getNumSubscribers() const

Returns the number of subscribers that are currently connected to this Publisher.

Thanks for the reply, but I'll put more information about my problem: when I have the Publisher object I know that I can use this method. But I need to know the number of subscribers in another node. I don't have the Publisher object, just the name of the topic.

"AttributeError: 'Publisher' object has no attribute 'getNumSubcribers'"

@Cerin: this is C++, not Python.

With rospy, use get_num_connections().
