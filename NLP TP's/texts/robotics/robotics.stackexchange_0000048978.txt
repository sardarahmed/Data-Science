Q:

rviz segfault core dumped (tried all OGRE_RTT_MODEs)

Hi,
I am using ROS fuerte on ubuntu 12.04.2LTS
I was running rviz happily until I did an apt-get update/upgrade.
Many ROS packages have been updated, then when I run rviz I get the following error:
micmac@xubuntu:~$ rosrun rviz rviz -d /home/micmac/fuerte_workspace/neato_robot/XV11-Kinect.vcg
[ INFO] [1362475463.736896709]: rviz revision number 1.8.17
[ INFO] [1362475463.737052628]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.3 (Cthugha)
[ INFO] [1362475463.851547794]: Loading display config from []
[ INFO] [1362475463.851693479]: Loading general config from [/home/micmac/.rviz/config]
Erreur de segmentation (core dumped)
I tried to set OGRE_RTT_MODE (export) to all supported modes, without success.
Still segfault.
Could you please help me ?

You could try to delete RViz's temporary folder in ~/.rviz
I'm not sure though if this could help.

I have tried to delete the ~/.rviz folder completely, but same error (segfault). The ~/.rviz folder is re-created but rviz still crashes. I also have to say that it crashes even with no config file specified ("rosrun rviz rviz" alone).

You can try to update/reinstall your graphic drivers.
If that doesn't help, try to build from the source.
Are there any other nodes running when you start RViz?

Okay i'll try to update graphic drivers. There is not other node running when starting RViz.

Updating to the latest graphic drivers revision (nvidia) solved the issue ! Thanks !!

You're welcome. I'll post this as an official answer, would be happy if you could mark it as correct then.

Hi miacmac:
I have met the same issue as you mentioned. Could you please tell me how to update graphic drivers?? Thanks in advance !

A:

After some apt-get updates you will have to update the graphic drivers.
If that doesn't help have a look at the RViz trouble shooting:
