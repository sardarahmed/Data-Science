Q:

Moveit! and rviz interactive markers problem

Hello dear Community!
Could someone help me with the problem I'm experiencing with Interactive Moveit! markers in rviz with my simple test robot arm.
Please review the link www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1c8A-DfghA and tell me please why I can't change the Goal State with the Interactive Marker? And as you would see from video I can do this through the Planning Tab, setting the random Goal State. What should I do to force Interactive Marker to change the Goal State?
Please help me with this stopper.
Please feel free to ask from me (I do really want find the problem) all that is necessary to help to resolve this problem. I have successfully used pr2_moveit_config tutorial, and Interactive Markers for move groups (like right_arm) out there works fine.
Thanks, Alexey!

A:

The problem is that having an arm with less than 6DOF, dont allow you to control your arm in position and orientation (since you dont have enough DOF to do that), so the motion planner fails. Then in this situation if you want to have a correct control you have to set an "only position planner".
