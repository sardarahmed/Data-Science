Q:

Adding Moving obstacle

How do I integrate the animated box from gazebo with ROS?
It is bit unclear on how to launch it along with my Robot.
Thanks !

A:

Hey guys,
The best bet for adding moving obstacles will be to use the message
gazebo/set_model_state

Incase, if you need a much more elaborate code for moving obstacles, Checkout this turtlebot_3_machine_learning_moving_obstacles
Thanks !
