Q:

Which ROS version to use with opencv

Hi. I would like to use the feature detection library from opencv to detect an object and then navigate the mobile robot to the center of the object . I dont know only which version of ROS should install and to use it with opencv. I know that can use  CvBridge to Convert Between ROS Images and OpenCV Images.
Thanks

A:

You can use any version of ROS you like starting from electric or any versions after it. http://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv

However if I am right, the OpenCV shipped with ROS Kinetic has some modules missing right ? For some of the latest OpenCV 3 features like tracking, you may have to make some changes in your CMakeLists.txt file and make it point towards a custom OpenCV+ OpenCV_contrib build.
