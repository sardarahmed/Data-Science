Q:

invalid choice: 'create_enclave'

I'm using foxy release of ros2 installed from the debian package here: https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Linux-Install-Debians.html
I tried to run some simple tests by following the examples here https://github.com/ros2/sros2/blob/master/SROS2_Linux.md
But I end up having an error saying 'create_enclave' is an invalid option. I thought it's a thing that was introduced in foxy so I'm a bit confused. Maybe there's something wrong with my installation but not sure what.
$ ros2 security create_enclave
usage: ros2 security [-h] Call `ros2 security <command> -h` for more detailed usage. ...
ros2 security: error: argument Call `ros2 security <command> -h` for more detailed usage.: invalid choice: 'create_enclave' (choose from 'create_key', 'create_keystore', 'create_permission', 'generate_artifacts', 'generate_policy', 'list_keys')

I installed the ros-foxy-ros-base package and apt claims its the latest version:
$ sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros-base

ros-foxy-ros-base is already the newest version (0.9.2-1focal.20210226.000028).
