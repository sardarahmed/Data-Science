Q:

admin password for viki

Just downloaded the ROS Groovy Galapagos VM bundled with Ubuntu and the Administrator is 'Viki'. When my laptop recovers from sleep it wants a password. Any chance of making the password public?

A:

Found answer. Password is same as user name: 'viki'. Stupid system won't let me post link to article but it's an article on nootrix.com about virtualizing ros.
