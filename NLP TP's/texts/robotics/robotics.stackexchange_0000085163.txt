Q:

/clock topic not recived on master

I am building a G-mapping based SLAM robot .
Master - This is my desktop .

roscore is running here
192.168.1.6 is the IP address

Robot - The robot is hooked to a RPI3 .

I have added this to the .bashrc file , "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.6:11311"
IP address of the RPI is "192.168.86.165"

I am publishing /clock (which is required for the node publishing /odom) from the RPI on the Robot .
I am not able to receive the /clock on the Master .
Essentially the client is not able to communicate back with the master , how do i fix it .

A:

Have you set ROS_IP on both hosts?

Edit:

Should i set the ROS_IP on both Master and Client ?

Unless you have a working DNS setup for both: yes.
Note: if you have DHCP configured, adding the (current) IP addresses to /etc/hosts is not sufficient, as the IPs may change in the future / on reboot. If you have DHCP, make sure to have proper DNS as well (ie: updated by your DHCP server).
And just making sure: have you checked the ROS/NetworkSetup guide?

Edit2:

On the robot instead of export ROS_IP=192.168.86.165, it was export ROS_IP=localhost

I would be very much surprised if that works. It could work now, but I guarantee you that you'll get in trouble later.
