Q:

A* (A star algorithm) implementation in gazebo

Hi Everyone,
I am working on my project but now i am puzzled at A* algorithm implementation. I have successfully done these things. please see the attached image

Anyone please guide me how to implement A* algorithm.
Thanks

What is your question? This seems like asking for help on a homework.
Where is your actual problem in implementing it? Don't you understand the algorithm?
Gazebo is a simulator, you don't implement an algorithm for navigation in there
What are those images supposed to tell us?

Sorry for the confusion.
Actually, I have followed tutorial of pioneer robot model and successfully executed the simulation in Gazebo and RVIZ.
In the Image attached shows the current progress like in the image the red arrow that tells the robot to move in that direction.

But I need to set a point on the map and calculate the distance through A* algorithm. For this I need help that where I have to write A* code (in global planner or in local planner).

A:

The move_base package will do that for you. By default it uses Dijkstra's algorithm which is very similar to  A-star, but you can change it to A-star if you like.
