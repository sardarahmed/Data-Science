Q:

Set joint rotation range?

Hi everyone, I was wondering if there is a way to specify minimum and maximum angles of rotation for a joint? I want part of my robot to be partially articulated but the specific function shouldn't rotate the full 360 degrees.

A:

On your model's SDF file, you can specify the joint's upper and lower limits in radians.

Just the answer I was looking for, thanks. I still haven't gotten used to the new SDF API yet.
