Q:

How can I estimate depth of a feature point / object using single camera?

I am trying to estimate depth of a feature point that i find in my image. I read this paper that estimates the depth using a motionless camera and an object of known height to calculate horizon line. I was wondering if its possible to use the same approach for a camera thats moving and object thats stationary.

A:

Researchers from Davide Scaramuzza's group authored a paper in 2014 about a probabilistic technique called REMODE that estimates depth from a single moving camera. The algorithm performs per pixel depth estimation from a camera stream and regularization based on uncertainty estimation. It should be suitable for your application involving a moving camera and a stationary object.
The paper can be found here, and the implementation of the algorithm can be found at this repository. The implementation uses CUDA libraries, so you'd need access to an NVIDIA GPU to run it.
