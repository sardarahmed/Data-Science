Q:

tf to tf2 SendTransform type error

I am working on some forked code that is setup for tf and on my BeagleBone Black I only have tf2. I have most of the code working but it is erroring out on sendtransform with
TypeError: sendTransform() takes exactly 2 arguments (6 given)
I am not sure what to change to the new format. I haven't found a way to get the recipe to cross compile tf. But in the long run it would be better to convert over.
I am working on base_controller.py on my github account FriedCircuits\Ros_Arduino_bridge
(can't post links yet)
Any help to convert it to tf2 would be great. I haven working on this for weeks on the BBB and I am pretty close to having something functional.
Thanks!

A:

It looks like it now takes a TransformStamped() message, rather than individual args.  The docs & tutorials seem to be older than the hydro code.  For example:
transform = TransformStamped(header=Header(stamp=rospy.Time.now(), frame_id="parent"),
                             transform=Transform(translation=Vector3(x,y,z),
                                                 rotation=Quaternion(qx,qy,qz,qw)),
                             child_frame_id="child"
                            )
self.tfbx.sendTransform(transform)
