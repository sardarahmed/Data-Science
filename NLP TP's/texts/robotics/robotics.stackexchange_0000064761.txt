Q:

Set a parameter through ROS services

Hi to everyone,
Yesterday I was going through the parameters of my work environment in ROS. One of my colleagues told me that if I need to change a parameter I should do it within rosservice and not by doing:
rosparam set /pathToTheParameter/parameterUniqueName

He was not able to explain me why but I would like to understand it.
Someone of you could please help me?
Thanks.

He might be talking about the dynamic_reconfigure package.
