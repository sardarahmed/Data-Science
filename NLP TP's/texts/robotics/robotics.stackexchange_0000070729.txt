Q:

Using ikfast with 4DOF fails

Hello List,
to get my arm working in moveit, I try to create the ikfast code for a 4DOF with the commands:
rosrun collada_urdf urdf_to_collada my_robot.urdf my_robot.dae
rosrun moveit_ikfast round_collada_numbers.py my_robot.dae my_robot_rounded.dae 5
python `openrave-config --python-dir`/openravepy/_openravepy_/ikfast.py --robot=my_robot_rounded.dae --iktype=translationxaxisangleznorm4d --baselink=1 --eelink=5 --savefile=ikf.cpp

This always fails. First there is a warning:
/usr/local/share/openrave-0.9/plugins/openravepy_configurationcache.so: libconfigurationcache.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

But this file really exists!
Then at the end there is the following error:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sympy/matrices/matrices.py", line 2580, in matrix_multiply
raise ShapeError()  
sympy.matrices.matrices.ShapeError

I tried to make the urdf as simple as possible, it only consists of the needed links and joints.
The urdf-file can be found at HERE
I tried more complicated urdf's and they work.
I use ros-indigo and openrave-0.9 on ubuntu 14.04.
Hopefully someone can help, thanks in advance.

A:

When I generate my IKFast plugin for my manipulator, I must to install ROS Hydro for converting the URDF file to Collada, because Indigo didn't work.

converting URDF to collada worked for me without any problems.  I am running indigo igloo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
