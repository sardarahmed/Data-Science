Q:

Install catkin from source

In the source files (https://github.com/ros/catkin branch: groovy-devel), a bug is fixed, that is not in the PPA repository for Ubuntu 12.04 (https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/5328).
I would like to install the new version from the source code like described here: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin .
When I do "make install", catkin is installed to /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share.
But in ROS, still the catkin binaries from /opt/ros/groovy/bin seem to be used, the problem remains.
Manually copying the files to /opt/ros did not work either.
Could you explain step by step, how to install catkin from source?
Thanks and Regards,
Moritz

A:

You want to use the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

Thanks, it worked. Unfortunately it did not solve the targeted bug, but this is another topic.
mkdir ~/catkin-download
cd ~/catkin-download
git clone https://github.com/ros/catkin --branch groovy-devel
cd catkin
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/groovy ./
make
sudo make install
