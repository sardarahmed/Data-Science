Q:

How to use laser_scan_matcher with depthimage_to_laserscan and gmapping?

I am kinda new to ROS here, so please help me out accordingly.
I am using ROS Indigo on a Ubuntu 14.04 system. I am using an Asus XTion Pro Live to record a bag file of the /scan topic that I am getting from depthimage_to_laserscan node. I can view the scan properly in rviz and also through rosbag play.
Now, the issue is that I want to use gmapping to perform some basic SLAM but I don't have an /odom topic. So I thought of using laser_scan_matcher to get the Pose2D from my "fake" laser scans.
I tried out the demo given here and it worked perfectly. However, when I try it with my own bag file, I don't get any output in rviz.
How can I use laser_scan matcher output with rviz?

**EDIT:**  
Here is what I'm doing so far  
 1. `roscore`
 2. `roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch`
 3. `rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan image:=/camera/depth/image_raw`
 4. `rosrun laser_scan_matcher laser_scan_matcher_node`  
Here is the error I get from laser_scan_matcher
Could not get initial transform from base to laser frame, "base_link" passed to lookupTransform argument target_frame does not exist.
Skipping scan
Here is my rqt_graph

Okay, got it working. There was an issue with the tf tree being published to laser_scan_matcher.
Here's my working launch file for laser_scan_matcher.
Just replace step 4 with roslaunch <this_launch_file>.launch
<launch>

#### publish an example base_link -> laser transform ###########
### this was the error ###
<!--node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_link_to_laser" args="0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 /base_link /laser 40" /-->
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_link_to_laser" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 /base_link /camera_link 100"/>

#### start the laser scan_matcher ##############################
<node pkg="laser_scan_matcher" type="laser_scan_matcher_node" name="laser_scan_matcher_node" output="screen">

    <param name="fixed_frame" value = "odom"/>
    <param name="base_frame" value="base_link"/>
    <param name="fixed_frame" value="world"/>
    <param name="use_alpha_beta" value="true"/>
    <param name="use_odom" value="false"/>
    <param name="use_imu" value="false"/>
    <param name="max_iterations" value="10"/>
    <param name="publish_pose" value="true"/>
    <param name="publish_tf" value="true"/>
    <param name="use_vel" value="false"/>

</node>
</launch>
