Q:

UDOO sicktoolbox

Hello, i am running ubuntu 13.04 on UDOO and ros hydro. I have been trying to install sicktoolbox_wrapper on udoo since yesterday by following the "using sicklms" guide but unfortunately i get stuck at the first step, when i try to do "rosdep update" i get an error which says "AssertionError: unable to handle 'index' format version '2' please update rosdistro.  But when i try to update it tells me "python-rosdistro is already the newest version".Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Which apt repository are you using?

A:

According to the ARM Hydro status page, the sick packages should be installable through apt (they're currently marked as outdated because I'm working on updated builds).
Try:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-sicktoolbox-wrapper

UPDATE
The UDDO installation instructions were using a very out-of-date ARM repository (I've updated them now); please update your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list to:
deb http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros raring main

For some nodes, no output and no prompt is normal. I don't have much experience with the sick driver, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to do. Do you have an x86 machine that you can compare it with?

yes actually i use it sometimes on my laptop as well and it works right away.. Even when the sensor isnt connected.. i get this error- Unable to open serial port
[ERROR] [1408884066.958296001]: Initialize failed! are you using the correct device path?" ..

I guess it is because m unable to see my sensor as a /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 device on UDOO.. I've tried compiling a kernel with cdc_acm module enabled but with no luck.. It still doesnt do anything.. :(

It's quite possible that the sick driver doesn't run well on ARM; you're probably one of the first people to try it. You should open a ticket and work with the package maintainers to troubleshoot your problem.

I just connected my usb memory stick, i can access the contents. It is being mounted properly but UDOO is not creating a device node for it as well. Could it be a kernel bug or something? or m i missing something here.

M sorry, i know this is not the place for such questions but i figured you could help me with this. i've tried most of the relevant forums but no replies whatsoever. The kernel version is 3.0.35

The issue on sicktoolbox_wrapper is https://github.com/ros-drivers/sicktoolbox_wrapper/issues/4 ; let's keep the discussion there now that we know this is a bug.
