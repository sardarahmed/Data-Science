Q:

openni "creating depth generator failed"

Hello,
I just installed the diamondback base and openni_kinect package. Then, if I do
rosmake openni_camera everything was compiled successfully. Then, if I do roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch, it says
[ INFO] [1310405330.895508189]: [/openni_node1] Number devices connected:

nni_device.cpp @ 59 : creating depth generator failed. Reason: Got a

like above.
I don't know how to solve this problem,
Can anybody help me with installing openni_kinect and what my problem is???
Thank you
