Q:

irobot_create_2_1 for fuerte

Hello,
I have a iRobot Create that I wish to control using ROS. I have a Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS fuerte installed. From what I searched in the internet, I find that the brown university drivers for iRobot were developed for electric and there are no versions of that driver available for fuerte. However, I tried installing them using the following command,

sudo apt-get install
ros-fuerte-brown-drivers

and the drivers installed successfully. After installing this I was able to successfully launch the "irobot_create_2_1" driver using the command

rosrun irobot_create_2_1 driver.py

Here's the problem. When I checked the info of the rosnode create, I get the following information.
ashok@nightFury:~$ rosnode info create
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Node [/create]
Publications: 
 * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

Subscriptions: None

However, according to tutorials that use the electric-brown-drivers, I should be getting the following information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can you please help me figure out why I'm not able to get the same information as the electric-brown-drivers? If there are other better ways to control the create can you also please guide me to them.
Thanks in advance,
Ashok

A:

The maintainers of irobot_create_2_1 are no longer actively updating this package.  I would recommend looking at the turtlebot_driver in the turtlebot stack for interfacing with the Create.  If there is larger interest in using irobot_create_2_1, I can take a look at addressing this issue over the next few weeks.

For future readers: Although turtlebot_driver is the underlying code for the create on the turtlebot stack, turtlebot_node is what you want.http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_node
