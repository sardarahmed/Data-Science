Q:

RQT Topic Monitor displays empty array as non empty

Hello,
I encountered a strange behavior in RQT where is displays an empty array as non empty.
Here's the output of rostopic echo and a  screenshot of rqt taken at the same time :

You can clearly see that rqt shows that 1 message (id=0) is in the array even though rostopic echo says the length=0 (rostopic echo is right)
RQT dispolays the last state of the array before it was empty.
Am I missing something or is it a bug of rqt or something else ?
Thanks !
