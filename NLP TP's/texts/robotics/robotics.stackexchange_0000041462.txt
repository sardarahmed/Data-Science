Q:

Why I can use rviz to show the depth points (Kinect Xbox 360)

Dear All.
Today |I buy a xbox360 Kinect, install it on ubuntu 11.04 ros electric. Everything is fine.
But when I run
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
rosrun rviz rviz
I can see the rgb image.
But I can not see the depth image. I add one pointcloud2.
Set the Fixed Frame (top left of rviz window) to /camera_depth_optical_frame.
Add a PointCloud2 display, and set the topic to /camera/depth/points.
I can not see any information.
How to solve the problem.
I am sure the hardware s good,and it is normally from another computer.Only it is not worked for my laptop and desktop. Linux 11.04, ros electric.
I also try the kinet+mouse demo. it works.
Without depth information, I cannot try the roboearth package.
Thanks any help.

A:

Answer by my self.
Finally I find I just need set views as XYOrbit. And use mouse to select good view. Thus I can see the depth image.
It is really stupid but important.
