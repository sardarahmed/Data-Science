Stops always in the same place?

In your 'software sources', check if the download location is set to a server close to your current location. If not, set it accordingly and re-try.

What hardware are you installing this on?
Comment by MichaelKorn on 2013-04-29:
Are you sure the installation stops on a package from the ros repository? Which package?

A:

If it always stops on the same package it is likely that there is already a new version of that package and the old one can not be downloaded anymore.
Try running "sudo apt-get update" again.
