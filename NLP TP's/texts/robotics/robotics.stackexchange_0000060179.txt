Q:

How to synchronize the map in Rviz and Stage

Hi to All,
I am new to ROS. I am doing the navigation simulation based on the package of "navigation_stage". I replace the default map with mine and generate the .world file. But when I run the simulation, the maps in Rviz and that in Stage are not synchronous (they are not in the same coordinate). I notice the size, orientation can be adjusted in the .world file. But I do not know how to set the values for them.
Is any one know about this?  Thanks in advance.

i also need help in doing the same thing plz can someone help us all

A:

I recently ran in the same problem and summarized all I found out in this post
There are two main points:

align coordinate system, taking into account that .yaml origin gives coordinates of lower left point in the image, while .worlds's pose gives coordinates of the centre of the map.

add a black border around the image, because otherwise it would be trimmed by Stage
