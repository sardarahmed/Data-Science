Q:

Proper cable to connect 12 V, DC 6 Ah batteries to Sabertooth Motor Controller for Lawnbot?

I am building a (fork of) the Lawnbot-400 robot found on Instructables.com and in the book Arduino Robotics.
The author, while brilliant, tends to gloss over and omit details, one of those being how he actually connected the 2 recommended 12 V DC batteries to anything (I realize for the more experienced builder this is probably obvious though).
Could you please provide guidance on the types of cables to use to do this? 
It seems like I have seen some which use little clamps on one end and / or which have a plastic terminal in the middle of the cable that can be disconnected while the other 2 ends are connected to the battery and motor controller. Do I need those features?
The batteries I am using are Mighty Max 12 V 6 Ah high-rate gel series.

A:

If you search for "battery quick connect" you will see for little plastic connectors that will enable you to connect/disconnect the batteries.
These are not 100% necessary, yet they do make life easier when working with things: you just unplug the batteries when you don't want your circuits "live".
The "cables to use to do this", just your regular cables.  The size of the cable depends on what power you will be transmitting through it.  There are nice charts on the net giving you info on what size you should use depending on the power draw.  You can search for "cable sizing chart" to check which would work for you.
