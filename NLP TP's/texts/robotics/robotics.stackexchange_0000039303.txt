Q:

Can't run pioneer2dx.world in gazebo, segmentation fault

I tried to run the simulation as it's explained in this tutorial:
http://mobotica.blogspot.com/2011/09/using-gazebo.html
I am a complete beginner in ROS, and I see that I have ros electric installed opposed to the diamondback one in the tutorial. The error I get is:
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

@IvanThe .world file I used is from here - http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/wiki/Gazebo:Tutorials:pioneer2dx_moving
I placed it in my ros_workspace and I'm pretty sure I put the path in correctly.

I used the commands:
cd /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/bin
./gazebo /home//ros_workspace/pioneer2dx.world

Try the following command rosrun gazebo gazebo $( rospack find gazebo )/gazebo/share/gazebo/worlds/pioneer2dx.world. That's the pioneer2dx world file that is shipped with Gazebo and should work.

@MatijaB As mentioned by @Timo RÃ¶hling and @Ivan Rojas Jofre, I also think that the path is the problem - gazebo surely works nicely and pioneer2dx.world is a well written file

@MatijaB To avoid confusion, you can also download the pioneer2dx.world file from this location - http://ubuntuone.com/5pWIiUyo1mhrY2PHP4I86C

@MatijaB Also, the permission (sudo) may be an issue ! So, it will either be (1) path or (2) permission (sudo)

A:

Might be simpler to go the ros route at first, we maintain a ros-ified version of gazebo.  All the relevant documentations, instructions for installation and tutorials are on ros.org.
Let us know if you have any question about any of these particular projects.
On a side note, if you are interested in inner workings of gazebo, and want the latest and greatest or hack on the sources, please visit gazebosim.org, start with these tutorials.  If desired, you can find the gazebo repository on bitbucket.
Thanks.

@hsu Yo ! ...... but that may be a bit steeper learning curve for the newbie ! ..... I would say, for a newbie - stick to ROS and say about 3-4 weeks later check out gazebosim.org ! ...
