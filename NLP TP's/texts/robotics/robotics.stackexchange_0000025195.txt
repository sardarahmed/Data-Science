Q:

scan -> nav -> motors?

I built a 2 wheels robot, and I can control the wheels through GPIO on a RPI4 8gb
I can launch a couple of TF transformations, launch the lidar, navigation and the rviz the result by launching these commands in different terminals
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 map odom
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 odom base_footprint
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 odom base_link
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link laser
ros2 launch sllidar_ros2 sllidar_a1_launch.py
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py

then I wrote a service to controll the motors with GPIO and provide sensors data to the navigation system
but as I read the doc, willing to have the nav2_bringup to talk to my service, I feel
I am going the wrong way
it looks incredibly difficult to do such a simple thing with ROS
I am confused and need help from more experienced users
thanks

I am reading Rico's book(*) although compiling the book project fails on ubuntu 20.04 VM while works on a raspbery pi
but RPI is too slow to run gazebo
