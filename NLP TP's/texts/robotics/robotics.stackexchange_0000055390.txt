Q:

Problem building package that needs opencv

Hi, I'm getting an error during catkin make that I can't seem to get past.
I made sure to install ros-groovy-opencv2, yet I don't seem to have the opencv2Config.cmake file.
Thanks in advance!
Here is the error:
==> add_subdirectory(img_sender)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package): Could not find a configuration file for package opencv2.

Set opencv2_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration file for opencv2.  The file will have one of the following names:

opencv2Config.cmake
opencv2-config.cmake

A:

Hi Brad,
In CMakeLists.txt of your package, do you have lines as follows?
find_package(OpenCV)
include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(my_awesome_library ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES})

Hi cognitiveRobot, I have a question regarding find_package(OpenCV).
Because when I use rospack find OpenCV, it says there is no such package
Yet I do found this this folder at /opt/ros/hydro/include/OpeCV
with  opencv2Config.cmake and  opencv2-config.cmake two files
and there is indeed no package.xml here
So what exactly is OpenCV here if it's not a package?

OpenCV is a conventional library that is packaged as ROS package opencv2 for convenience of installation.
