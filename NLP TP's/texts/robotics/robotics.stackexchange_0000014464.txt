Q:

How can serial manipulator have unique condition number for given end effector position?

I am reading about Condition Number which is considered as measure of manipulability of robotic arm, it is defined as
$$
k = \parallel J \parallel \parallel J^{-1} \parallel
$$
Where,
$$
\parallel J \parallel = \sqrt {tr(JNJ^{T})}
$$
How this can be a unique value for given end effector location, as manipulator can reach a point in workspace with different joint variable values, which in turn will change Jacobian value ?

A:

Condition number and manipulability are measured at a specific joint configuration, not end-effector location. You already understand it correctly that the values change according to the robot configuration as they are computed from the Jacobian.
