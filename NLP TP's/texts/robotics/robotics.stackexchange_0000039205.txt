Q:

How to save result file of Gmapping? (through rviz)

Hi.
I'm trying to do tutorial : SLAM Map Building with Turtlebot.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Build%20a%20map%20with%20SLAM
My environments are ubuntu 11.10 and ROS electric.
My execution sequence is like this.

roslaunch turtlebot_bringup.minimal.launch (on the turtlebot)

roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch (on the turtlebot)

rosrun turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard& (on the workstation)

roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch (on the turtlebot)

roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch (on the workstation)

rosrun rviz rviz -d rospack find turtlebot_navigation/nav_rviz.vcg (on the workstation)

rosrun map_server map_saver -f /tmp/my_map (on the turtlebot)

After do all sequence, I get rviz screen.
And then when i execute 7, I couldn't get map file (my_map.yaml)...
I don't know why.............
Help plz...

Do you mean that you don't get ONLY .yaml file? Or both .yaml and image file? Also, just making sure, have you created /tmp folder ?

Also, although I'm not sure exactly what phenomenon you're dealing with, I might have experienced similar situation. See http://answers.ros.org/question/11957/map_saver-doesnt-return-from-waiting-for-the-map

no... I couldn't get any files..... and when i execute 7, i  waited 5minutes more.... but console is not changed...
Comment by JamesJeong on 2012-04-02:
when i execute 7, i couldn't see " [INFO] [ros.time] : Waiting for the map" message... but i know that you already get this message. and you solve your problem through rebooting.. right? i did already trying that... but it's not solution in my case...

and i'm confirming connection between my workstation and turtlebot through command(rostopic list), dashboard, ping.... what should I do...?
Comment by JamesJeong on 2012-04-02:
When you had succeeded,  you would execute this command in this directory ("turtlebot@turtlebot-1:/tmp$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f /tmp/my_map" ) right? so i did same your case, too..... but fail......

i get some message in console.. that message is this.         [ERROR] {1333382381.914160288]:  [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at [192.168.0.67:11311].   Retrying... this case is that  i execute in tmp folder....

rostopic list doesn't confirm your connnection.  See the link from @fergs answer below.

A:

Have you setup both the turtlebot and the workstation to find each other?
(see: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines for details)
