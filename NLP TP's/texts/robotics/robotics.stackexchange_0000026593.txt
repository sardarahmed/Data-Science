Q:

Problem with drcsim installation

I am installing drcsim using the instructions here: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/DRC/Install
When I enter the line: sudo apt-get install drcsim, I receive the following message:
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
drcsim : Depends: gazebo (< 1.9.0) but 1.9.0-1~precise is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
What steps can I take to fix this installation problem?
Thank you very much for your help!

I think that I need to install gazebo version 1.6 as this version seems to be compatible with drcsim. My  goal is to access gazebo, ROS, and the DRC simulation models/tasks/etc. What installation steps do I need to take to achieve this?

A:

See this thread and this thread from the mailing list.
