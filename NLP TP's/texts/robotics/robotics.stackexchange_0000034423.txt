A:

In addition to the other answers about how to remove Diamondback using
sudo apt-get remove ros-diamondback-*

you could choose to leave both Diamondback and Electric installed in /opt/ros. You can select which ROS version your packages will use by modifying a line in your ~/.bashrc file. If you were using Diamondback previously there should be a line like
source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash

To switch to Electric change that line to
source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash

You can only have one of those uncommented at a time (use # to comment one of them out). Then, either restart the terminal or run
source ~/.bashrc

That command needs to be run in each terminal (and terminal tab) that you have open. After switching that line you have to rebuild your packages so they use the current version. This is mostly so that the messages are all in the correct format. But, the point is that you can safely leave Diamondback installed after you install Electric.
