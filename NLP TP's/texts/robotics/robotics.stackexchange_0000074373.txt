Q:

Using ethzasl_icp_mapping in indigo with velodyne HDL-32E

I am trying to use ethzasl_icp_mapping on Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo.
Following the steps how I proceed :

first, I clone the :ethzasl_icp_mapping in my catkin_ws
I run catkin_make, no build file is generated of "ethzasl_icp_mapping_project"

Here are couple of the questions I have:

can someone give me the exact steps to run the project
I want to use point cloud from Velodyne HDL-32E

Could you finally succeed in using with Velodyne HDL-32E

A:

to compile the "ethzasl_icp_mapping" library in "ROS indigo" under "Ubuntu 14.04"
it is necessary do the following in catkin_ws / src :
1- git clone -b indigo_devel https://github.com/ethz-asl/ethzasl_icp_mapping.git
2- git clone -b release/indigo/libnabo https://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo-release.git
3- git clone -b release/indigo/libpointmatcher https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher-release.git

4- in

catkin_ws

execute: catkin_make_isolated
