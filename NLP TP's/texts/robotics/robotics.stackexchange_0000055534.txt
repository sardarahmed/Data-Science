A:

I suggest you to take a look to the Navigation Stack. You have to load the map with a map_server node and then you have to run a localization node (like AMCL), then you can use the estimate pose 2D button on rviz to estimate your initial pose.
To move your robot you will need a planner (like move_base) and send goals to this node.

As I said, I suggest you to follow the Navigation Stack tutorials. You could run and study this tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Autonomously%20navigate%20in%20a%20known%20map) to see how it uses and launches all the necessary nodes, and then try to apply it to your robot
