Q:

Extracting images from rosbag

Hi,
I'm trying to extract images from a rosbag file with video, following the instructions here:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosbag/Tutorials/Exporting%20image%20and%20video%20data
I edited the roslaunch file for my specific files and it says that it's saving images apparently, but I have no idea where they're going. They're not in the directory I ran the command from, they're not in the image_view package directory, and I tried using locate to find them but I couldn't find them that way either. I tried looking at the source of extract_images.cpp but I don't see why it's not working since I thought cvSaveImage should probably save it into the current directory if a full path isn't specified. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

A:

D'oh, I found out that it put them in the ROS_HOME directory, which happens to be ~/.ros/. Did not realize this. Hope this helps someone else later.
