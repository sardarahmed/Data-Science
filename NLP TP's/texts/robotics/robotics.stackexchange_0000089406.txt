Q:

include move_group_interface

I'm running ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
So I was trying to make my own MoveIt interface, after experimenting and getting comfortable with the demo.launch created by the moveit setup assistant.
But I immediatly ran into a problem, I can't figure out how to include the move group interface.
This is the line I'm using to try and include the move_group_interface:
#include <moveit/planning_interface/move_group_interface.h>

But whatever I try, I keep getting the following error:
fatal error: moveit/planning_interface/move_group_interface.h: No such file or directory

I'm guessing it has something to do with my CMakeLists.txt, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(robotarm_moveit)

## Compile as C++11, supported in ROS Kinetic and newer
add_compile_options(-std=c++11)

## Find catkin macros and libraries
## if COMPONENTS list like find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS xyz)
## is used, also find other catkin packages
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  moveit_ros_planning_interface
)

catkin_package(
  CATKIN_DEPENDS
    roscpp
    moveit_ros_planning_interface
)

include_directories(
)

## Declare a C++ library
add_library(${PROJECT_NAME}
  src/robotarm_moveit_interface.cpp
)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}_node src/robotarm_moveit_interface.cpp)

add_dependencies(${PROJECT_NAME}_node ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS})

install(DIRECTORY launch DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}
  PATTERN "setup_assistant.launch" EXCLUDE)
install(DIRECTORY config DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION})

Maybe somebody can spot what I'm doing wrong here?

A:

Try
   #include <moveit/move_group_interface/move_group_interface.h>

The MoveGroupInterface is inside the planning_interface namespace, but its header is located in the above directory.

Doesn't seem to work, I get the same error.
Should I maybe just try and reinstall MoveIt? The demo is working fine so I'm not sure whether that could be the problem?

Did you remove #include <moveit/planning_interface/move_group_interface.h>?
Comment by Squid on 2018-10-25:
Yup, what I mean by same error is that instead of
fatal error: moveit/planning_interface/move_group_interface.h: No such file or directory

I just get
fatal error: moveit/move_group_interface/move_group_interface.h: No such file or directory

Try that in CMakeLists.txt:
include_directories(
  include
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

That seemed to do the trick!
After I added that, I got some undefined references, but those where easily solvable by uncommeting the target_link_libraries() section in my CMakeLists.txt
