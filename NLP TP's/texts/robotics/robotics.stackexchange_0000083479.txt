Q:

Turtlebot 3 Questions

Can order a Turtlebot3 Waffle without an SBC or with an alternate SBC, and whether if I substitute the SBC am I now in an unsupported configuration?

A:

Turtlebot3 Burger and Waffle are sold as package so customizing your order will be difficult.
Turtlebot3 is running on the ROS based on Linux, I believe you can use the SBC as long as it supports Linux(Ubuntu 16.04), USB port, Wi-Fi connection.
Please check the operation voltage/power consumption of the SBC as OpenCR might not support power recommendation for a custom SBC.
Please understand that customizing the original package may void the product warranty.
