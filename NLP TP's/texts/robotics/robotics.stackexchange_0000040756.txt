Q:

Manually moving a Pioneer robot using P2OS

We have a Pioneer robot (P3DX) and when we send a Twist message with a forward movement to the base (/cmd_vel) but the robot doesn't start moving immediately. But if a rotation movement is sent (just rotation, no forward velocity), it does rotate immediately.
Is this a known behaviour of the P2OS stack? or the robot? or is this some kind of bug?

More likely some kind of configuration error.

This is my configuration:
What configuration could I be missing?

A:

I forgot to put my findings. After a while I realised that the PID parameters where changed. I updated them and now the robot is response to moving commands is much more faster.
