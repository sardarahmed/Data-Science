Q:

Build error with xsens_node autoware

Hello,
unfortunately I am new to most aspects of autoware. I tried to follow the Autoware.Auto installation.
The problem I have occured during my ade$ colcon build attempt. Here comes an extract of what kind of output was generated: https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/-/issues/582
I have no idea how to approach this error message and I would be very happy about any guidance.
If you need any further information, just tell me.
Kind regards, Lennart

A:

We had to make a change to reflect changes to a new version of the transport_drivers repository (udp_driver and serial_driver) being released to the build farm. This was fixed with this commit several months ago. Please pull the latest copy of the code with git pull and this should be resolved.
Additionally, you likely have old versions of the ade docker images. Please follow the General Troubleshooting Steps to update everything.
