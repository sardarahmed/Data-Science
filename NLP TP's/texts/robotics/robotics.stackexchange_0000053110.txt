A:

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full

But you cannot install it as Debian packages of Groovy ROS, don't know what you mean by that. Perhaps you mean the same way as Groovy.

exactly- Is the next following commands are the same way as Groovy?
For example:
1- apt-cache search ros-hydro
2- sudo rosdep init
3- rosdep update
4- echo "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
