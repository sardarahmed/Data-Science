Q:

kinect calibration parameter

When I use openni sample viewer to view the kinect images, I find that the depth can mapped on the color image. But I did not find the camera intrinsic and transfer parameters of the kinect. Can kinect provide calibrated images directly?

A:

While the point cloud is "calibrated", there is no internal mechanism in the driver to output rectified images. However, you can use image_proc to do this.
This answers is about where to get the parameters.
