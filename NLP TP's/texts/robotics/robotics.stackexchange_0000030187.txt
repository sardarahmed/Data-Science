when trying to launch OpenNI driver in ubuntu 10.10 using DiamondBlack, I experience the error above. I've tried looking for solutions online but none of the comments was very helpful for my case. There are these ticket links that seemed to work for other people but I guess it has been removed from the site.
Any suggestion?
thank you.
