Q:

Get dot file of ROS graph w/o rqt_graph

I'm working on a headless rpi3 for ROS development with an IMU shield. Its not ideal but works for the purpose.
When building new nodes and connecting them would like to see the ros graph. I've looked at rqt_graph which is great but don't want to install all the X deps on the pi and really not prefer to forward X either.
I see that the now deprecated rxgraph does have a --dot=DOTFILE argument, but rqt_graph does not. Is there any other way to export the graph as an image or dot file?

A:

ROS is distributed by nature. Is there anything preventing you from using another non-headless machine, configuring it to use your RPi as ROS_MASTER_URI and running rqt_graph on there?

Edit: If you don't have a working DNS for all the involved hosts, don't forget to set the ROS_IP env variable to the IPs of those hosts (so on my_rpi3 with ip 10.10.4.2, set ROS_IP to 10.10.4.2), not to the IP of the master. That is what ROS_MASTER_URI is for.

I'm slowly realizing how distributed ROS is (its a good thing imo). I knew nodes could connect remotely but completely forgot about ROS_MASTER_URI. I'll give that a shot!

@gvdhoorn that worked!
