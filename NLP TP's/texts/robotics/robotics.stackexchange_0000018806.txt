Q:

Robot moving sideways in RVIZ ROS

Hi, 
I have a wheeled-legged robot as you can see in the picture. When I simulate it in ROS-Gazebo it works fine, however at the same time in Rviz it moves sideways instead of forward or backwards. I have no idea why it is behaving like this. Would greatly appreciate if someone can give me some clue here.

A:

I have found the problem after some long search on the internet. The problem was that in Rviz, X-axis is defined as front of the robot and Y-axis is defined as the sideways. However, in my URDF I defined the robot in a way where Y-axis was its front and X-axis was its sideways. After fixing this, my robot moves normally in Rviz and Gazebo both.
