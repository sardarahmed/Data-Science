A:

you should setup the move_base first .maybe you can get some help from this tutorialnavigation_stage.But stage simulator is for 2D navigation,so if you want to simulation in 3D ,just choose other.
in this tutorial,you can change the type of globalplanner in move_base.xml in navigation_stage/move_base_config/ as you like and re-launch the package .good luck!
