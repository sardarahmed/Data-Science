Q:

kinect depth and rgb registration

Hi, im able to have rgb point cloud by registration using openni rqt_reconfigure. however, i want to access a pixel in rgb image (camera image_color topic) and find its depth. Which topic should i subscribe depth_registered/image_raw or depth_registered/rect.
I looked at the http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html . There is no depth in it. How can i access depth value

A:

The Kinect has the problem that not every pixel have an depth value.  So it is not easy the get the depth of an pixel.
