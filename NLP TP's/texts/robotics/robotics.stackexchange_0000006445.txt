Q:

Ways of reversing motor direction easily

My set up consists of a brushed motor (ex cordless drill type) connected to a motor controller which is in turn connected to a LIPO battery and an r/c receiver. All my cables are fitted with XT 60 connectors except for the cable that goes to the receiver which is a 3 wire pin (usual white, red and black).
The above set up is one of a pair which I am using in my battle robot. The motors are connected to drive wheels, left and right respectively. the problem is the motors are turning in opposing directions.
For some reason I neglected to switch the polarity of the wires of one  motor at the time I attached the XT 60 connectors and I really am not looking forward to re-soldering.  
So my question is whether there is any fast way of reversing the direction of rotation without soldering?  For instance can the R/C transmitter (a turnigy 9x without any modding)be programmed to switch up for down (hence forward for reverse)? 
Or can I maybe switch the pin connector going into the receiver (I don't think so because the ground is probably common, but worth asking just in case I guess). 
Any ideas or should I just get soldering?

A:

Yes, the Turnigy 9x and just about every RC transmitter can reverse channels. Look for Servo setup, reverse.  Step 9.1 in 9x manual
This assumes your left and right motors are on different channels. If you used a v-tail mixer to obtain turtle drive, you will have to experiment with it's set-up instead (9.17).
