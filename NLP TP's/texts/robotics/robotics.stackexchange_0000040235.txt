Q:

Problem with navigation stack

Hi all!
I am following this tutorial
http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup. I am running
it using stage. While I am running the move base part, I get such
error:
[ WARN] [1336375509.493321469, 8.800000000]: The origin for the sensor at (4.75, 4.00, -0.43) is out of map bounds. So, the costmap cannot raytrace for it.

Hovever when I am using rviz it seams that it is able to work
correctly sometimes.
Do you know any solution for this issue?
This are my yaml files:
base_local_planner_params.yaml:
TrajectoryPlannerROS:
max_vel_x: 0.45
min_vel_x: 0.1
max_rotational_vel: 1.0
min_in_place_rotational_vel: 0.4
acc_lim_th: 3.2
acc_lim_x: 2.5
acc_lim_y: 2.5
holonomic_robot: true
costmap_common_params.yaml :
obstacle_range: 7.0
raytrace_range: 3.0
footprint: [[-0.7, -0.55], [-0.7, 0.55], [0.7, 0.55], [0.7, -0.55]]
inflation_radius: 0.5
observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor
laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame: base_laser, data_type: LaserScan, topic: base_scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
global_costmap_params.yaml :
global_costmap:
global_frame: /map
robot_base_frame: base_link
update_frequency: 5.0
static_map: true
local_costmap_params.yaml:
local_costmap:
global_frame: odom
robot_base_frame: base_link
update_frequency: 2.0
publish_frequency: 5.0
static_map: true
rolling_window: true
width: 36000.0
height: 25000.0
resolution: 0.01
Best regards

Hi,
We had that same error message here, and we solved it by adding this line
map_type: costmap

both to the local_costmap_params.yaml and to the global_costmap_params.yaml.
cheers.
