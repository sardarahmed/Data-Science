Q:

why some launch file have extension type foo.launch.xml?

I am going through moveit pr2 tutorials and I see .launch.xml extension .Why do we need two extension.
For example pr2_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml

A:

roslaunch automatically tab-completes any files with a .launch extension. In order for launch files that are mostly used as includes to not (edited) show up on those listings, they are given a second extension .xml (which they actually are).

@gvdhoorn, you mean "... used as includes to NOT show up on those listings ...", right?

Yes, you are right. They don't show up, exactly because they don't have a .launch extension.
