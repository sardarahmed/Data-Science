Q:

No transform from [base_link] to [/map]

I know similar questions have been asked but I think mine is a little different.
I have a custom robot which is running Hector_Slam and the navigation stack etc, all is working well.  However I been advised to add a model (URDF) to the project so I can tell the system where my new sensors are going to go.
My Fixed frame is /map or I can use /laser
I created my robot which its top level thing seems to be base_link.  It complains that there is No transform from [base_link] to [/map]?
It also complains there is no No transform from [lwheel] to [/map] and so on?  If I fix the base_link error will it make the others go away? (the wheels are linked to base_link)
In my Hector Launch File I see lots or references to
<param name="base_frame" value="base_frame"/>

But nothing to base_link

To make things slightly simpler:

yes.

Man I need to buy you a beer or a pack.  Any idea how I link base_link to map?

Randomly I changed the base_link to base_frame however the wheel etc error did not go away

A:

in the base_frame  parameter, you should put the name of your "main" tf frame, it usually is base_link or base_footprint.
do you have odom? if not, set the odom_frame to the same as the base_frame
basically follow the guidelines here.
also there is no wheel in your tf tree, so probably something is wrong in your URDF.

I do have a base_footprint, is that the same as base_Link.  in My URDF, when I change base_link to base_frame, the main error goes away however, what do I need to do to link my wheels up?  I do have /odom_frame vai Hector
