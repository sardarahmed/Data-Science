Q:

autonomy_create driver yaw angle range is [2pi ~ -2pi]?

Hi all
I want to compare my odometry yaw angle and imu yaw angle to understand current accuracy of my IMU.
From what I get, IMU output is [pi ~ -pi] but the autonomy_create (using irobotcreate2) yaw angle output starts from 0 upto +/-2pi depending on the robot turning clockwise or anti-clockwise. is this correct?
If I can confirm autonomy_create output as [2pi ~ -2pi] I think need to change the source to match with my IMU output. I intend to run robot_localization and robot_pose_ekf in the future, but I think difference in yaw output range of my odom yaw angle and imu yaw angle will have some problem.
Thanks in advance.

A:

Rotations are represented as quaternions in ROS, so, for example, -pi/2 will have the same representation as 3*pi/2. As long as they are right-handed (yaw increases counter-clockwise), and they both have the same zero point, you should be fine.
