Q:

transform base_link to base_laser,map,odom

I know the meaning of transform base_link to base_laser.
But what is the meaning of transform base_link to map?
What is the meaning of transform base_link to odom?
Because I need the meaning to set the correct value in navigation program.
Thank you~

A:

You can check out the Coordinate Frames Convention.
In a nutshell,

odom to base_link is the position of the robot in the inertial odometric frame, as reported by some odometric sensor (like wheel encoders)
map to odom is a correction introduced by localization or SLAM packages, to account for odometric errors.
map to base_link is therefore the corrected pose of the robot in the inertial world frame.

These are dynamic transforms, and different components of the navigation stack are responsible for publishing them.

So,I should make a link of (odom,base_link) and(map,odom),but not (map,base_link),right?

Please, how can I access /map to /base_link tfs, that generated during gmapping ? I am looking forward your suggestion.
Thanks in advance.
