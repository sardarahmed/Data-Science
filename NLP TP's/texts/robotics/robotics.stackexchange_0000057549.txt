Q:

Can't download packages on raspberry pi?

I'm trying to install hydro by following the instructions on the wiki, but when I get to
$ rosdep install  --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y --os=debian:wheezy
I get
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-roscpp-serialization
After some brief experimentation with apt-get, I determined that I can't seem to access any ros packages. How can I resolve this? Sorry, I'm new to linux.

A:

The easyest way to get ROS work on Raspberry is following this instruction, however it is groovy and not hydro:

http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Raspbian
I have it running on the raspberry and it works well. As you are new to linux I definitely recommend first trying the groovy version, as it is much quicker and easier to set up on the raspberry (no need to build the packages from source yourself).
