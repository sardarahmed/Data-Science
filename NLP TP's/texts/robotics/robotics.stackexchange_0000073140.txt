Q:

Is there tutorial for creating interface in RQT?

I'm working on nav2d simulation and I want to create user interface for this simulation. Is there any tutorials or reading materials that helps to understand and use rqt for creating interface that can communicate with the simulator ?
If it is not possible in rqt and if I create an application in QT software then, is it possible to communicate with ROS ?

A:

If you want to learn more about rqt you might want to start at http://wiki.ros.org/rqt which contains information about what you can do with rqt as well as tutorials to create your own plugins for it in either Python or C++.
