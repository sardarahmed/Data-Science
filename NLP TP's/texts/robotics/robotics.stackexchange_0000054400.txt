Q:

catkin_make error in Hydro

I am following the step by step instructions on the gazebo tutorials and am somewhat dissapointed by this error in the final step (catkin_make):
Using Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS Hydro:

This looks like a build error in gazebo_ros_control which is in the gazebo_ros_pkgs repository, please file a ticket against their repository:

I am getting this same exact error with 12.04, ROS Hydro and Gazebo 1.9 (installed from source). But I can still roslaunch gazebo and see all the ros topics and services. Have you come across any solutions?

I am also getting the same error with 12.04, ROS Hydro and Gazebo 1.9.

Has anyone figured out why this happens?

A:

Hydro does not support Ubuntu 10.04. You should either use a newer Ubuntu version or stick with an older ROS distribution (see http://ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html#hydro-medusa-apr-2013).
Anyway the error message you have posted just shows a compile error due to missing declarations. But without further information what exact code (repos + branches) you have checked out in the workspace there is no way to tell if the set of packages should actually work together or if you have wrong versions checked out.
