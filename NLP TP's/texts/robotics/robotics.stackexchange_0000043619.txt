Q:

Mac OS X rosmake rviz failed to load wxPython.rdmanifest

Hi everybody!
After finally being able to install ROS Electric on a Mac OS X Lion, I am facing the following problem when attempting to build rviz:
rosmake --rosdep-install rviz

results in:
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: Failed to load a rdmanifest from http://mirror.ausparc.com/ros/sourcedeps/wxPython.rdmanifest, and no alternate URI given

I have manually checked the URI and it appears to be dead. Any ideas?
Thank you very much in advance.
Martin.

Duh! I am so dumb!! The solution to this is on the wiki (section 3.6): http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/OSX/Homebrew

A:

The solution should be in an answer, so that it shows up as answered on the main page:
