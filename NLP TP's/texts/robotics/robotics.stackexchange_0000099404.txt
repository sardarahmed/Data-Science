Q:

rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node error while loading shared libraries

Hi,
i'm trying to learn ROS and I am following the tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/it/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes.
When I reach part 1.7 I use rosrun but it returns an error:
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
/opt/ros/noetic/lib/turtlesim/turtlesim_node: error while loading shared libraries: libQt5Core.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I am using the Ubuntu app (version 2004.2021.222.0) for Windows 10 (version 2004 build SO 19041.508) with Noetic.

Hi Simone, just to clarify you are running Ubuntu OS 20.04 on a virtualizer such as Oracle VM VirtualBox or vmware workstation and you managed to install ROS Neotic sucsessfully and when you are running
roscd turtlesim
in terminal you will be directed to the package location right ?
Have you seen this link ?
they used
sudo strip --remove-section=.note.ABI-tag /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so

and managed to solve the problem

Yes, thank you.
That sudo command solved my issue.

A:

There is an open issue related to this on WSL GitHub. This StackOverflow answer mentions the steps that should solve the problem. Run them with sudo inside your Ubuntu environment.
In another answer as well, sudo strip --remove-section=.note.ABI-tag /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5 seems to have solved the issue.
