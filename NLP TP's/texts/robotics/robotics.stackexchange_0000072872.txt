Q:

Trouble accessing Raspberry pi 2 GPIO with python

I have a scenario in which i have to take readings from a DHT11 Temperatute & Humidity sensor and publish it to a topic (I am using python so suggestions keeping python in mind would be helpful). The problem is that i need to do sudo to assess the GPIO but again rosrun is not found when in sudo. What should i do ?

Please try to use the search next time (or Google: $searchterms site:answers.ros.org fi), this has been asked (and answered) many times before. See Raspberry Pi 2, ROS and GPIO access for a recent one.

But that case uses the WiringPI Library for C++. I am trying to do this with Python.

The question I linked as an example. There are many more, and also dealing with Python.

Also: WiringPi/WiringPi-Python.

Wiringpi2 says its deprecated and wiringpi still requires sudo. What should i do ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-03-21:
From _wiringpi2/README.txt:

This package has been deprecated in favour of using the name "WiringPi" which provides the same exact functionality.

It's just a name change.
