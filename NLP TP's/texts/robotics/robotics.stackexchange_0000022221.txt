Q:

Wheel encoder Tick calculation

Sorry for being a newbie. Can somebody explain me how many ticks a wheel encoder would deliver (based on one complete wheel rotation), if I have a slice with 500 windows? Is the assumption correct, that 1 tick is counted per window?
Thanks

A:

That depends on what type of digital encoder you have.
A full quadrature encoder has 2 light (or magnetic) sensors detecting up and down pulses. A single light source encoder can only detect speed, but not velocity (speed and direction). A full quadrature encoder counts 2 up ticks per window and 2 down ticks for the same window. This is also how direction is calculated - which of the 2 sensors ticks up/down first determines which direction the encoder is rotating. This means there are 4 ticks for 1 window on a full-quadrature encoder.
