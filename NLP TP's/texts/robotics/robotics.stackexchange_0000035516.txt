Q:

I have a mobile robot that isn't supported by ROS. How should I structure the driver node(s) to expose my robot's integrated sensors and actuators?

Please help in writing up a ROS best practice.

Should we create a wiki page with a tutorial for this answer? If so where should it be created (under the http://ros.org/wiki/Robots page)?

That seems like a good place for a link, at least. "Want to add a robot to this list? Here's how."

I think it's hard to give a general answer. I would use a different software design for a simple robot such as a Roomba (i.e. one node per sensor) than for something like the PR2 (something like pr2_controller_manager and pr2_etherCAT).

Although this isn't yet a tutorial, http://ros.org/wiki/Robots
