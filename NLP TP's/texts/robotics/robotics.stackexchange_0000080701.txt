Q:

Problem with running urg_node with UST 20lx

I have tried running urg_node using command rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:="192.168.0.10", but it gives an error std::length_error what() : basic_string::_S_create and stops. What does this error mean and how to resolve this. Thanks for the help in advance.

Hello,
I ran into the same problem, and I believe this is a bug in a new feature of urg_node (see my post on github: link text)
A temporary fix is to comment line number 466 in the file src/urg_node_driver.cpp:
// Before starting, update the status
updateStatus();

Then just run catkin_make again, and it should work.
