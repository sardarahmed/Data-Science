Q:

qtcreator Could not find 'share/std_msgs/cmake/std_msgs-msg-paths.cmake'

error info:
/opt/ros/indigo/share/genmsg/cmake/genmsg-extras.cmake:271: error: Could not find 'share/std_msgs/cmake/std_msgs-msg-paths.cmake' (searched in '/home/westeast/git/enmodel/devel'). trajectory/CMakeLists.txt:72 (generate_messages)
I add some .msg file in my package
but the qtcreator IDE can not build the msg .
I can build the package with msg in cmd by catkin_make
Is anyone know the reason?

A:

Seems to me you are running into this problem: #q202401
Can you see if sourcing your environment has the desired effect? If not, please post your complete CMakeLists.txt and the output of echo $CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

thanks so so much . I solve the problem by add CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: /home/westeast/git/enmodel/devel;/opt/ros/indigo in my qt build config. At the begining my $CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is empty.
and emember click the apply button when you change the config.
