A:

You might want to be a little more specific about what is not working....
In any case: If you have a urdf with joints in the most general case you need the robot_state_publisher to be up and running http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher and a node that publishes your joint_states, see http://wiki.ros.org/joint_state_publisher

thanks for the reply. actually my urdf is a vehical model. which have four links for four wheel. and each is connected to actuator (motor) in the urdf model. I want to run those motors. which method will be simplest. Should I do this with pr2_controller_manager or pr2_controller_interface.

You might have a look at ros-control; http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control. However, I have no experience using ros_control.  Clearly, your will still need to create or find a ros driver for your low level motor controllers...
