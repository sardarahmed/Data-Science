Q:

Sample_NIUserTracker in openni_kinect?

Hey all,
where can i find the Sample-NiUserTracker Viewer in the new kinect stack?
The openni_tracker works fine and i can see the skeleton tranformations in rviz, 
but I miss the GUI Viewer for easier people tracking. 
Thanks

A:

The new stack doesn't have a standalone program for tracking users. Maybe because it's not a part of ROS i.e. a standalone. You might have to use the old binary in the "ni" stack.
roscd ni
cd openni/bin/
./Sample-NiUserTracker

thats great, cause I've been switching between ni stack and openni_kinect sometimes

It's not there because it adds noteable dependencies etc.  I've opened a ticket to add a deb of the example applications https://kforge.ros.org/openni/trac/ticket/10
