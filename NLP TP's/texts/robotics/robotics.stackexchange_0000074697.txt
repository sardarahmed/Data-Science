Q:

error generating dynamic reconfigure .h files

Hello
I am migrating a package from rosmake to catkin. So far I've been sucessfull. The only problem is that, I don't know why, when it generates de dynamic reconfigure configuration files (the ones ending in Config.h in the case of c++) are not stored in devel/include/PACKAGE_NAME/. What it actually happends is that it apperars folder within the src of the package with the name of the package containing the python for the dynamic reconfigure and another one in the folder wher I have the configuration file for generating the dynamic reconfigure options called cpp where the .h file is stored.
I've been able to reproduce the same problem with this test package. Could you help me?
Thanks!!

A:

Did you change to using the catkin version of the parameter generator?
from dynamic_reconfigure.parameter_generator_catkin import *

That part of the catkin migration is easy to overlook. (I did.)
See: http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/dynamic_reconfiguration.html
