Q:

SolidWorks URDF exporter incorrect link masses

As far as I can tell, there seems to be an issue with the SW->URDF converter which causes the mass of every link to be set to the mass of the entire assembly, rather than that single link. For example, I can create a robot composed of two rectangular links, one of length 1m and expected mass 10kg and one of length 0.5m and expected mass 5kg. When the exporter runs, it assigns a mass of 15kg to both links. Am I misinterpreting the expected behavior?
I've also noticed that looking carefully at the video on the Willow Garage blog here: http://www.willowgarage.com/blog/2012/10/18/exporting-urdfs-directly-solidworks (at around 59s) that the demo appears to have the same behavior I observed.
