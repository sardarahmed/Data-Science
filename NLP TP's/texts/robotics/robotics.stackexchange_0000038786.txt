Q:

roscd returns "bash: reldir: unbound variable"

Hi everyone,
When going through the tutorial, I get errors with certain ROS (navigation) functions:
$ roscd roscpp
bash: reldir: unbound variable
$ rosls roscpp_tutorials
bash: reldir: unbound variable
$ rosed roscpp
bash: 2: unbound variable

Any ideas how to resolve this?

Info:
System: Ubuntu 11.10
Bash: GNU bash, version 4.2.10(1)-release (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
Affected tutorial step: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem
I tried so far: Reinstalling ROS (using apt-get).
What works: rosnode, roscore, rospack, ... (most methods)
What doesn't work: roscd, rosls, rosed

Note: During first config as described in the tutorial, I got the following errors:
$ source /opt/ros/electric/setup.bash
bash: PYTHONPATH: unbound variable
bash: ROS_MASTER_URI: unbound variable

I resolved this by manually defining these variables in ~/.bashrc:
$ export PYTHONPATH=$ROS_ROOT/core/roslib/src

Thanks dornhege,
my .bashrc didn't contain set -u, but it contained set -o nounset instead.
After uncommenting that, all problems mentioned above disappear. I did not change any ROS scripts. Does this mean that ROS scripts are not programmed robustly enough?
In any case, ticket closed.

-u is short for -o nounset. About the script: I'm not sure, maybe it only works like this in bash. Otherwise it would be worth ticketing.
