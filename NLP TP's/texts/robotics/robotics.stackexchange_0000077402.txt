Q:

teb_local_planner steering angle

Hi Guys,
I'm new in the ROS environment and this community, so first of all I want to say Hello to everyone of you.
I want to setup an SLAM based autonomous car. The car should detect obstacle with the help of a Lidar sensor. I'am able to create a map of the environment and set an estimation point and a goal. For the navigation I use the navigation stack + the teb_local_planner. There I have some troubles with the MAP update because I have only a Pentium Processor in the notebook. But maybe I can fix this problem with bette configuraions. My problem as soon as I got a path I have to send the moving commands to my car. For that I have a raspberry pi on the car who will forward a steering angle and a speed value to my motor management. But I don't know in wich topic the teb_local_planner publish these topics.
If you need more information tell what I have to publish to you.
Many thanks and I look forward to your answers :)
Best,
Felix

A:

If you are using move_base the result is output to the topic cmd_vel (arrow on the bottom of the image on the move_base webpage ) as a geometry_msgs/Twist message .
I haven't used a car-like kinematic myself, but I just found this page http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner/Tutorials/Planning%20for%20car-like%20robots with more details for the teb planner and ackermann kinematics.
The sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. could interest you.
