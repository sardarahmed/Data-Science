Q:

Using rosdep to install WG maintained stacks

I am trying to package some of my robot's stack it's easier to get running on a base installation of ROS-Desktop-Full. In particular, my stack depends on several stacks that aren't installed by default (e.g. prosilica_camera, laser_drivers, etc). These stacks are developed by Willow, so there are debs available (i.e. ros-fuerte-prosilica-camera, ros-fuerte-laser-drivers, etc) and it works fine if I manually install the debs.
I thought rosdep would handle this (i.e. rosdep install my_stack), but it doesn't detect any missing dependencies. Is rosdep the right tool to do this? If not, is there another way of achieving this type dependency resolution?

A:

To install those stacks apt-get install ros-fuerte-stack-name is the way to install them with all their dependencies.  rosdep installs system dependencies of source packages in your workspace.
