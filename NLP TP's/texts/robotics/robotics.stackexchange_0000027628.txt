Q:

roslaunch RRBOT doesn't work

Hi, I'm trying the example found here.
I cloned the gazebo_ros_demos in my /src.
I've no problems with
roslaunch rrbot_description rrbot_rviz.launch

But when I try to launch RRBot to Gazebo with :
roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch

it appears this on my screen:
core service [/rosout] found
process[gazebo-1]: started with pid [3477]
process[gazebo_gui-2]: started with pid [3481]
process[urdf_spawner-3]: started with pid [3485]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/jade/lib/gazebo_ros/spawn_model", line 25, in <module>
    from gazebo_ros import gazebo_interface
  File "/opt/ros/jade/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gazebo_ros/gazebo_interface.py", line 9, in <module>

log file: /home/gabriele/.ros/log/fd4ef6e0-cf48-11e5-a228-e839df8a64f0/urdf_spawner-3*.log

Gazebo starts, but rrbot doesn't appear neither in the world, nor in the model database.
I'm not able to understand if the error is in the file (like rrbot_world.launch, rrbot.world) or if I forgot to insert something in the bashrc file.
What am I missing here?
Bye

A:

I found the problem. There was a compatibility problem: replacing mi 6.5 version of gazebo with the 5.2 version the problem disappears.
Thank you.
