Q:

Creating N links using a For Loop in Xacro

I wonder if it is possible to construct a for loop to build N wheels sub-assemblies for a mobile robot in a xacro.urdf file.
I have already created an URDF using Xacro for the mobile robot and the wheel sub-assembly but I need to generate N wheels on each side of the mobile robot.
Any ideas, turnarounds or out-of-the-box solutions?
Thanks,

A:

An alternative to xacro with urdf is to use SDF with embedded ruby (see the rigid_cart model for an example).
Use the following command to generate the sdf file from the rsdf template:
erb model.rsdf > model.sdf

Thank you scpeters, i'm not familiar with ruby but it seems to be an efficient turnaround solution and merits the effort.
