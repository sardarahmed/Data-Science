Q:

Start second Rviz instance

Dear all,
can I start somehow two different Rviz instances which run on two different PC but connect to the same ROS master?
I have one ROS master running ROS Indigo. There I am running different tools to control a robot. Now I would like to connect with a second Linux PC to the first ROS master and start another Rviz instance to see the current state of the robot.
Is this possible and if yes, how do I have to specify the command on the second PC?
Best

Have you tried using rosrun rviz rviz on both and seeing what happens?

Thanks for the hint, I also had to do the export ROS_MASTER_URI=myipadress to conenct it to the master. But anyway I have trouble to see the robot in the second PC.
In Rviz I still cannot see the robot. Please see the uploaded picture which I did: https://ibb.co/fD1LjF

You should really update your answer with a proper screenshot vs a picture of your monitor taken with a camer/cellphone.

sorry, the PC is right now not connected to the internet so it was the only chance to get some kind of screenshot

A:

Just use rosrun rviz rviz on both computers. Should work.
