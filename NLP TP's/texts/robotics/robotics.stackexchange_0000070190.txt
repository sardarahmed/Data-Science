Q:

catkin_tools and qtcreator

Hi, I am using catkin_tools and I have configured QTCreator as told in the wiki page, more concretely following these instructions.
However, I find myself manually opening each package as a project and I am working with tons of packages. Although CTRL+Click works (it takes me to other packages), I find a bit annoying that I have to open each package manually.
Is there a better solution for this (something like we did with catkin_make)?
Thank you!

A:

I agree that this can be somewhat tedious, but as building with catkin_tools means performing isolated builds, i.e. every package is it's own CMake project, I don't think there's a easy solution for this. QtCreator per default just opens CMake projects. With catkin_tools there are many of those as opposed to a single one (as when using catkin_make).
I suppose it could be possible to write some sort of script that adds and opens all packages in a workspace with QtCreator either by using command line options or generating a appopriate config file, but I'm not aware of existing efforts.
