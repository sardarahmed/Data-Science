Q:

No  tag in the model database

hello ,
I probably did something to my environment because when I run my GAZEBO now I get this:
Error [ModelDatabase.cc:228] No  tag in the model database database.config found here[http://gazebosim.org/models/]
Error [ModelDatabase.cc:287] Unable to download model manifests
I'm using GAZEBO 2.2 and ROS Indigo on UBUNTU 14.04
thanks for helping...
Ron.

A:

Looks like the model database server went down. Can you try again?

Tanks Nate, its working now.
How can I check it next time or restart this server manually?

The fix requires us (OSRF) to reset a server that Gazebo relies upon. If you notice this again, please contact us and we'll resolve the issue. A longer term, and more reliable, solution is in the works.

Hey I am having the same problem as 'benshaul'. The server that Gazebo relies on seems to be down again. In insert tab all I see is ' Connecting to model database...'

Bam got hit just now with this. Maybe we should start a contribution system..if you contribute you get the good server. :)

This happens whenever the servers are down. They should be back up.
