Are you trying to compile the robot_localization package from source code? If so, have you tried to run rosdep before catkin_make?

I replaced  #include <xmlrpcpp/XmlRpcException.h> as #include <XmlRpcException.h> and #include <string.h> it works thank you.

I'm having the same issue. Just cloned the latest version of kinetic-devel. There is no directory named xmlrcpp in the include/robot_localization directory, is it meant to be installed by the user?
Comment by zobocop on 2017-04-13:
Fixed by running rosdep install [package] on any packages that threw an error during catkin_make. For robot_localization this triggered an apt-get installation. I had originally used git clone as I was updating an old version of robot_localization.

Same issue. Cloned latest kinetic-devel branch, ran rosdep update, confirmed ros-indigo-xmlrpcpp is installed, but same error when compiling. Is this an issue because I'm running Indigo?
Comment by jacobperron on 2017-10-20:
I see now that the headers were pushed into a directory in ros_comm starting with 1.12.7 and Indigo release version is 1.11.21.

A:

I replaced  #include <xmlrpcpp/XmlRpcException.h> as #include <XmlRpcException.h> and #include <string.h> it works thank you.
