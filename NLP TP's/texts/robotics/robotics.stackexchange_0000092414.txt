Q:

Is msg TopicStatistics deprecated in ros2?

In ros1, it was possible to subscribe to /statistics which is of type TopicStatistics
http://docs.ros.org/api/rosgraph_msgs/html/msg/TopicStatistics.html
Is this message & topic available in ros2?
I dont see it listed under ros2 rcl interfaces
https://github.com/ros2/rcl_interfaces/tree/master/rosgraph_msgs
I also see that the ros2 demo for topic monitoring has a different implementation
https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/master/topic_monitor/topic_monitor/scripts/topic_monitor.py

Found another post that seems to indicate the same thing - absence of message TopicStatistics in ros2
https://answers.ros.org/question/324293/enabling-statistics-in-rqt_graph-for-ros2/

A:

No, we have neither that feature nor that message yet in ROS 2. We definitely should implement it, as it is a very useful feature in ROS 1, but we just haven't gotten around to it yet.
It would be great to have an issue to track this feature (maybe on https://github.com/ros2/ros2/ since it will span C++, Python, and tooling) and even better would be a pull request :)

Thanks for your feedback William
I've opened a feature request as you suggested: https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/744
Perhaps if time permits will definitely look into contributing to it
