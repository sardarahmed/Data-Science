Q:

installing ROS from source, PCL build issue

Hey,
I'm trying to install ROS Fuerte from source on Ubuntu 12.10. I'm having trouble when rosmake -a is trying to make PCL. Does anybody have any tips how to solve this?
Part of the error:

A:

Building PCL from source is difficult on ROS Fuerte. The sources from pointclouds.org will not work with ROS.
Since you are using Ubuntu, you may be able to build it like Willow Garage does, using their github PCL repository.
If that does not work, there are many other questions on answers.ros.org relating to this subject.
