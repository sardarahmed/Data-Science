Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Costmap layers

Hello,
is there a way to insert and remove a costmap2d layer through code (not manually) during an operation?
I want to insert a virtual confinement (i thought its best to do it with map Layers) for my turtlebot and then remove it after a certain condition has been met.
UPDATE: does anyone know of the "Parameter" that can enable/disable a Costmap layer during run time?
Thank you guys :)

A:

Generally, costmap layers are not changed during runtime. However, you can have a parameter that enables/disables the layer.

@David Lu thank you very much. can you tell me the name of this parameter and that where i can set it (config file or within the code)? appreciate it.

Most layers have a dynamically reconfigurable parameter called "enabled" https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/jade-devel/costmap_2d/cfg/ObstaclePlugin.cfg

@David Lu, Could you please elaborate a little more regarding loading a costmap layer during runtime. Aside from setting the enable parameter via dynamic reconfigure, would it also be necessary to "restart" costmap2DROS so that the new costmap layers are loaded into layeredcostmap?
