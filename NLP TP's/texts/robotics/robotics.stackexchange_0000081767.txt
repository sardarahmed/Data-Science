Q:

moveit regression? Found empty JointState message

Dear List,
Since the last update of indigo (juli 2017) I am getting error messages in move_group with moveit.
For example with moveit-commander, after each "go up" or so, there are 4 lines with
[ERROR] [1499944106.195095905]: Found empty JointState message

Moveit seems to work however.
It did NOT occur before the last update, and it also occurs in the kinetic version.
Anything I can do?
Regards, Sietse

NB: in order for errors to show up, you need to format them as preformatted text. Use the button with 101010 on it for that.

+1 Observing same issue across three different robots in Kinetic, does not affect the operation for any of them.

A:

I noticed that too, but did not find the time to debug it yet.
This is the relevant commit: https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/commit/492e8816c5385880a99486765e958a98d11e3df2
To the best of my current knowledge the error message does not change any behavior of the node though, but I'm not 100% sure.
Apparently some code in the PlanAndExecute pipeline uses the RobotStateMsg -> RobotState conversion tools without checking whether the message is actually filled in.

Anything I can do?

You could track down when and where this happens and file an issue on the github project.
That would (hopefully) help a lot.
--- EDIT ---
By now, this should be fixed upstream. See https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/589 .
