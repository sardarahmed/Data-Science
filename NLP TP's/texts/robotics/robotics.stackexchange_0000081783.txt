A:

You can use this version instead:
https://github.com/Pankaj-Baranwal/pocketsphinx/
It contains quite many updated features of pocketsphinx. And also supports backward compatibility.
So it will work perfectly! And it is well maintained. So, if you have issues working with it, you can simply open a new issue and the maintainer should respond with a solution soon!
It is well documented too. You can follow the wiki, or the blog posts here:
