Q:

Using laser_height_estimation with different hardware configuration

I would like to know some information about laser_height_estimation package. Is it feasible to be used with my hardware configuration that be found here.
Even though the functionality that the package provides seem to suit with what I'm searching for, but, the way the laser scanner is mounted is different. Is it still doable to use this package to estimate height?
Thanks in advance.

A:

The laser height estimation is normally used by providing a small number of laser beams (5 to 20 degrees maybe). They can come from :

a laser scanner mounted vertically
a laser scanner mounted horizontally, with the addition of a vertical deflecting mirror

I believe your case describes the first option, so yes, it should work. Make sure you provide an accurate tf between your base frame and the laser frame.

The strange thing is I still cannot invoke "const mav_msgs::" to autocomplete it, as if it's not well configured to find your defined datatype..any ideas?
