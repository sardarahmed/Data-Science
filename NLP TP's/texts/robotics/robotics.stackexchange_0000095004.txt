Q:

Why is my robot moving so slow with MoveIt?

My robot is running slower than it should. It can move much faster. How can I make it go at full speed?

A:

By default, the velocity and acceleration is set to 10% of the robot's maximum in MoveIt (starting from Noetic). You can change the values in your code with this C++ and this Python function, or change the default value in the joint_limits.yaml file in your moveit_config package.
