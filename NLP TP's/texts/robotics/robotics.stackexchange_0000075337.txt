Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-ros-base

I try to install ROS indigo on ubuntu 14.04. I followed the instruction on the page http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu. After I input sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full. The terminal outputs:
Reading package lists... Done

Building dependency tree       

Reading state information... Done

E: Unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full

And additionally I want to install ros-indigo-ros-base on jetson tx1. The terminal on tx1 outputs the same messege.
Is ros-indigo still available?

Are you running 32-bit Ubuntu (armhf) or 64-bit Ubuntu (arm64 or aarch64)?
Comment by sclin on 2016-07-21:
I run L4T which is 64-bit Ubuntu aarch64.
Comment by sclin on 2016-07-21:
Is there any difference between 32-bit Ubuntu and 64-bit Ubuntu for ROS installation?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-07-21:
Not on amd64 or x86 (the 'desktop' distributions), but for ARM, not all packages are build for all architectures. See Incomplete packages for kinetic armhf jessie fi.
Comment by emchenk on 2016-07-21:
did you add the necessary software packages into your sources.list correctly and did you do
sudo apt-get update  ?

A:

I changed the system to 32-bit, and installed ROS correctly.

Just to follow up on this, there are no binaries for ROS Indigo on aarch64.

Can you pls tell where can we look up this information? I mean I know that there is a web page that lists the supported architectures of the packages. Which one is that?
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-07-22:
The Indigo installation page links to the Ubuntu ARM installation page, which lists the supported and tested platforms.

Thank you. But I was looking for this page
