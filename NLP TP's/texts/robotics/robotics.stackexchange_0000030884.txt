Q:

ROS packages for Ubuntu 11.04?

I was just curious when packages will be available for Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty)?

I'd rather be running 10.10, but unfortunately I can only get hardware support for my laptop on 11.04. I'm able to follow the instructions to install ROS from source, but I'm still working through how to add packages and stacks (I'm new to all this).

11.04 is far from stable, I would wait a bit before you switch.

A:

We generally do not spin up debian packages before the official Ubuntu release.  Natty is not due for release until April 28th.

Natty debs are now available from the repo at packages.ros.org

Ok, I understand that, thanks for clarifying. I just thought there was some mysterious reason to intentionally hold back the debian packages until the release date.

It takes work to spin up debs for a new Ubuntu release.  Dozens of stacks require compatibility patches.  These generally come from the community as we try to stick to LTS releases in our own development.

Why not? I believe there are many users that upgrade to a new Ubuntu version the day it comes out (it's like Xmas every six months!). Whether that's clever or not is a different question, but they could be saved some trouble if you started building debian packages, say, when the RC comes out.
