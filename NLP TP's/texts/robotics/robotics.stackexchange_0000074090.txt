Q:

Error in running "sudo rosdep init"

I had previously installed ROS Jade distribution, I have uninstalled it and trying to install Indigo, while running sudo rosdep init I get following error :
ERROR: default sources list file already exists:
    /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list
Please delete if you wish to re-initialize

As suggested in one of the answers I tried using sudo pip uninstall rosdep to uninstall previous version which gives sudo: pip: command not found
Is there any way to manually remove rosdep?
running which rosdep gives me this /usr/bin/rosdep
I found this question on the same error

Did you try doing what it says? Deleting the file /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list and then running sudo rosdep init again?

sudo rm /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list

A:

You don't need to uninstall rosdep, just make sure it's up to date.
rosdep isn't too tied to ROS releases, so it should work fine.
