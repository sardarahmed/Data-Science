A:

It is possible. Depending on the environment you might also achieve acceptable results.
You can use pointcloud_to_laserscan to generate lasers from kinect an then run gmapping or hector_mapping.

The more features like corners you have, the better. Long hallways or large rooms might be bad, especially considering the limited FOV and max range of a kinect.
