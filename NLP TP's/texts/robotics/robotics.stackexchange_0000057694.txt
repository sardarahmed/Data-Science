Q:

Sending and receiving data over a network to a non-Ros computer

I was wondering if it is possible to send data over a network to another computer using TCP. One computer is running ROS and the other is not.

A:

Yes, this is possible. You just have to use your custom TCP communication code inside a ROS node. You can then, for example receive data on a ROS topic via a callback, process it, and send it out to the non-ROS computer using your custom TCP connection setup.
