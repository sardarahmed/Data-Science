Q:

ros_info float32[] c++

I'm new to ROS and am trying to print part of LaserScan message, in particular the ranges bit. Is there a format identifier or some other nice way to print this float32 array out?
Thanks

A:

Not the vector itself, but you can print the whole message with ROS_INFO_STREAM.
