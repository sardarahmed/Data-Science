Q:

Inverse Jacobian Matrix without moveit

Hello, I want to know please how can I get the jacobian matrix and its inversion via ROS tools.
I have calculated a jacobian matrix and applied the inversion using c++ code and I am getting wrong results.
Can you please guide me solving this?
I have to get at least a good way to make the inversion of my 6 by 6 jacobian matrix.
For the moment, I am using the following code to get the inversion:

Thank you by advance!

Hi!
Several days ago I tried the Orocos-KDL  forward and inverse kinematics solvers including inverse velocity (cartesian space to joint space) solver/algorithm. Is your task a robot velocity control? If yes, I will extract and post example of code...
Best wishes,
Maxim.

Hi Maxim,
I'm currently also working on velocity control using Orocos-KDL and would highly appreciate that example code you were talking about!
