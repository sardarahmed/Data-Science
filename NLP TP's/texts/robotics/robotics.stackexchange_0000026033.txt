Q:

Streaming Camera Data to Separate Application

I am in the process of building an application where I would like to embed the Gazebo simulation environment only into my application and then run non-interactive ROS modules on it. It seems like I should be able to acquire frames from the camera like in the tutorial here and then pipe them elsewhere for display. Does that seem like a feasible way to approach the problem? I don't want to get too deep into hacking and find out what I'm doing isn't viable at all.

A:

That is one way of doing it.
The other way is to subscribe to the image topic from your application. This will require your application to compile against gazebo though. Find the topic using gztopic list in command line.
This example shows how to subscribe to a topic, and here (line 120 and line 145) shows you how to get the image data from the msg.
