Q:

bash: setup.bash: No such file or directory

Following the instructions in Chap 3 of Learning Robotics Using Python (Ubuntu 14.04), I added the ROS workspace path.
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

When starting a new terminal I get the message in the question line.
Is anything wrong?

Have you run catkin make in the workspace yet ?
Does the file setup.bash exist in your workspace, and is that the correct path to it ?

I ran catkin make
setup.bash is in /opt/ros/indigo but I don't know how to determine whether it is in my workspace

the line added to the .bashrc file is trying to read a file  ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Error is the file is not there. you don't have a workspace set up, different name than catkin_ws, or location. More on setting up http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

A:

The others are right--you didn't run catkin_make yet. Make sure you did all these steps:
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

I put semicolons as line terminators because the newlines aren't showing in my answer. Just a bit of extra safety, that's all.

That's because you didn't format it as Preformatted text. Use the button with 101010 on it next time.

Cool! I didn't understand what that button was at first glance--thanks for the tip!

Thank you all. Now I can open a new terminal without nasty messages.

I was working on a project. I installed husky_ws but then I deleted it. When I open a new terminal, it says " bash: /home/lenovo/husky_ws/devel/setup.bash: No such file or directory ". I can't revert to catkin_ws. I did what you said, but nothing has changed. What should I do?
