Q:

Web mapping that can be used for autonomous vehicles/robots

Is there web mapping tool that allows developers to use it to plot GPS data of autonomous vehicles/robots?
Google Maps forbids it. See 10.2.C. Google Earth terms of use link jumps to the same page. Bing Maps looks the similar (see 3.2.(g)).
What I want is a internet-based tool that shows either/both satellite images and/or map, which can overlay plot using its API. I'm making a generic GPS plotter on ROS that could be used both for slow robots or fast vehicles/cars.
Thanks!

A:

Google Earth exists for precisely this purpose: overlaying your own data on a map.  You simply write scripts to translate (or export) your data into KML format then add the URL to Google Earth like so:

With regard to terms of use: the terms of use for Google Earth only forbid you to use the software to control the behavior of your vehicle, not to represent its past behavior.  (Their concern is most likely to limit their liability from you trying to draw a path on a road in GE for a robot to follow, and having it crash into something due to a map inaccuracy.)
As quasi-proof, I wrote a mission planner with Google Earth at one point (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK0wWH9Ijnk) which I showed to the Google Earth team; they were fine with it.  They also put me in touch with a team at NASA that uses Goole Earth for this purpose.  I'm led to believe that such usage is allowed since I'm only generating mission scripts and not interacting with the autonomy.

I'd summarize my read of both of those as:

Don't use our logic to provide turn by turn navigation to vehicles
Don't use our maps for business asset tracking unless you've signed a commercial use agreement

Hard to tell if your use case described violates either of these terms.  In any case, check out http://www.openstreetmap.us/.
