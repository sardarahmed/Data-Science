Q:

add fake obstacle to /obstacle topic used by costmap_2d

I need to add a "fake" or arbitrary obstacle to the /obstacle topic that my real pioneer 3dx is using to navigate.  Is this possible? and if so how? Thanks

A:

You could create a node that provides a fake point clound describing your obstacle.

Not really, sorry. I guess, you'd have to create the point cloud manually, maybe (in case you only need two dimensions) by linear interpolation between the corners of your obstacle. But don't nail me down on that. I haven't done this before. Someone else could most likely be of better help here...
