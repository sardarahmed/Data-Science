Q:

Error in Setup gazebo plugin paths - GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH

Hi, I am trying to add a controller to my robot, (using plugin). So I am going to follow the tutorials Mobile Base Control and Plugin Hello World. But I have three problem:
1 - /grad/hadi.kazemi/my_plugin/my_plugin.cc:2:21: fatal error: gazebo.hh: No such file or directory so I add a /gazebo/ to all include lines and the error vanished.
2 - error: ‘ConnectWorldUpdateStart’ is not a member of ‘gazebo::event::Events’ when I try to make, so I delete this line (this line was in the first tutorial).
3 - after removing the make worked well but when I try to run this command: export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=pwd:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH** or **export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:~/my_plugin/build/ it gave me this error: GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH: Undefined variable. and so when I add my model to the world (using insert) I have: Error [Plugin.hh:152] Failed to load plugin libmy_plugin.so: libmy_plugin.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
how can I handle these errors?

did you source your bashrc after setting the plugin path? you can verify it by running $ echo $GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH, and see if the path where the plugin .so is included

I did not install gazebo in the computer by myself. I am a PhD student and the university tech group installed it for me. I have not a root access and I don't know what is bachrc? I did your command : echo $GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH and the same error: GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH: Undefined variable.

A:

I solve my problem by adding "setenv GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH ~/my_plugin/build" to .cshrc
