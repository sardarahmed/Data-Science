Q:

How to implement code controlling the robot

Hello everyone,
Currently i'm taking care of a project from another student, who just vanished since two months - but my dep still needs the project finished. So i have to dig into the system fast und get the whole simulation to run.
The setup is - as far as i can see - an ROS Hydro server with a husky as robot. The client from gazebo is used to view the simulation. The problem is, that i only get the husky to move via the rostopic command, but not through code.
The goal of the simulation-setup is to run java code, that controls the robot depending on the output of the sensors. I already understood that rosjava will be needed, but this isn't installed on the server - i will have to take care of that.
So, my question is - how can i control the robot via c++ code? In the tutorials i only got information about how to send messages and about the filesystem and so on. Did i missread the whole thing? It would be really nice if someone could dip my face into it :D
Thanks in advance,
Nathan

A:

You can publish to a ROS topic from C++ code. Please refer to this tutorial for details. You should be able to do the same from any of the other languages implementing ROS clients, like Python or Java.
