Q:

How can I use ros-fawkes plugins and fawkes_msgs node with ROS-Melodic?

I want to use navgraph plugin of the fawkes. I try to follow installation guide of fawkes. But I got make error 1 and 2 which is not the topic for ros answers.
Since I couldn't install fawkes, I wonder if I can use navgraph package on its own. Is it possible to add navgraph as a plugin?

A:

If you want to use Fawkes and ROS together, download the latest version of Fawkes from their github directory. Then follow the steps given in their website.
git clone git://git.fawkesrobotics.org/fawkes.git
cd fawkes
make all gui

Then to start navgraph you should start fawkes just like roscore. After that follow instructions related with the navgraph in their website.
For my application I find out that ros packages like topological_navigation are more helpful than navgraph.
