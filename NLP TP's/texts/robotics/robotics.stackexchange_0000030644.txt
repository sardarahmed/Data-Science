Q:

dpm_detector build fails in linking

This is linking to an unknown library. It seems that it's octave related but I haven't found the correct Ubuntu 10.10 install. I added octave to the core rosdep.yaml for ubuntu 10.10.
This is my error:
  Linking CXX shared library ../lib/libdpm_wrapper.so
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -llapackgf-3
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lblas-3gf
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  make[3]: *** [../lib/libdpm_wrapper.so] Error 1

This is my change for octave in rosdep.yaml:
octave:
 ubuntu: 
  '10.10': octave3.2-headers
  '10.04': octave3.0-headers
arch: octave
macports: octave
centos: octave-devel
debian: octave3.0-headers
opensuse: octave-devel 
fedora: octave-devel
gentoo: sci-mathematics/octave
freebsd: octave

It seems that now it needs to link agains liblapack and libblas instead of the gf version. These
