Q:

Does gmapping require amcl?

Intiuitively, I would have thought that while a map is being built with slam, that some localization would also be happening to ensure that as the map is extended this is based on the best estimate of the current loclation (and because of the L in SLAM). I ask because I was surprised to note that in the standar .launch files for creating slam maps (e.g. gmapping) amcl is not started. I started wondering: Is that some kind of mistake, doesn't gmapping require amcl?

A:

amcl is used for localisation only when your map server is publishing a static map. The gmapping algorithm does localisation as well as mapping simultaneously.
