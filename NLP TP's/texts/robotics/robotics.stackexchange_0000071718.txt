A:

The easiest and preferred way of installing packages is via
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<your distro>-<package name>

like e.g.
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-hector-slam

If there is no debian build or you need the source version for some reason you clone the Github repo to the src folder of your catkin workspace.

If the debian binary package is available, you should follow BennyRe's answer, else you should follow RoSPlebb's answer. One thing to be careful while using the git clone command is to specify the branch if required.
