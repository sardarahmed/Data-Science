Q:

adding new dependency to a package

Sorry this is probably a stupid questions...
I've downloaded and successfully built the mrpt_common, mrpt_slam, and mrpt_hwdrivers packages.  I assume this now allows me to reference some, if not all, MRPT functionality in a ros package.
However, when I add a reference to a mrpt class and add the include it get errors.
So now I'm wondering whether doing rosmake --rosdep-install  doesn't resolve things.
Can someone help me out?  My goal is to be able to reference and use any of the many useful MRPT classes from within a ROS package.
Thanks

A:

Hello!
If I understand you in right way, you should open next file:
your_project_dir/manifest.xml
and add something like this:
Also, you can create new package with dependencies, e.g.
roscreate-pkg yourProjectName mrpt_common mrpt_slam mrpt_hwdrivers
After package name you should list all dependecies.
Hope this will be useful.
