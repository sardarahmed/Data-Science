Q:

Can we pass multiple config files to a node in ROS2

Currently, in all the examples I have seen, load a YAML file inside the Launch file, and pass it to the ROS2 node.
I am curious, is there a possibility to pass more than one YAML file to a ROS2 Node?
Something like:
def generate_launch_description():
    ld = LaunchDescription()
    paramaters_one = os.path.join(
        get_package_share_directory('my_robot_bringup'),
        'config',
        'my_params1.yaml'
    )

    paramaters_two = os.path.join(
        get_package_share_directory('my_robot_bringup'),
        'config',
        'my_params2.yaml'
    )

    multiple_parameters_node = Node(
        package='my_robot_bringup',
        executable='multiple_parameters_check',
        name='multiple_parameters_check',
        parameters=[paramaters_one, paramaters_two]
    )
    ld.add_action(multiple_parameters_node)
    return ld

You can find an example how we are doing it in UR Driver repository. For loading files, please check the few lines before.
