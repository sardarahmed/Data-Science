Q:

designing a ROS diffdrive Robot with rosjava

I'm currently designing an android robot. I want it to be as much as possible compatible with ROS.
It is a simple differential drive robot with a good odometric precision and sharp sensors.
I would like to know if there is ROS standard node and topic list for diff drive robot?
There is many msg I could be compatible with : pose/ pose2D / posewithcovariance / twist / ...
Of course, I would like my robot being compatible with many stacks, especially Navigation and teleop stack.
I understood that I need to design rviz robot model, is rviz robot model a good starting point?
I'm reading the ROS documentation, but for know I didn't found any specifications that define a standard topics, services and param list.
That would be perfect, if I could have a standard that define : standard node's list / standard services and param / standard topic with type
If no standard like this exists, is there a simple reference ROS robot code that could help?
Sorry for this newbie's question...

A:

You could look through the codes of some of these robots. I personally referred quite a bit to the turtlebot's because the tutorial is quite complete.
My own experience in working on differential drive robot: here. I did not start with the robot model though. That came quite late into the development because I was eager to see things moving.
I would think the topic cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist) is a good starting point, since both the teleop and navigation uses it to control the robot.
Another good reference I found by mwise of willow garage: here
