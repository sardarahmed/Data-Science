Q:

How to move objects and robot models using GUI?

Is it possible to move objects and robot models using move to command in gazebo GUI? I have been trying to do it without success. Gazebo documentation also skims over it without going into details. Thanks in advance.

A:

The arrow buttons at the top allow you to drag models around the world from the gui.
Does that answer your question? What move to command are you referring to?
Although you're totally right... I can't find anything in the tutorials on basic gui operation. If it's not there somewhere it's definitely worth adding.

@Peter : I tried using arrow button and mouse to drag the model, but its only changing view angles. I get 'move to' option after right clicking on the model.

Documentation about the toolbar move modes can be found here: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=guided_b2&cat=#UpperToolbar . The "Move to" option on a model's context menu makes the view follow the robot, it's useful when the robot is moving around the world and you want to keep it within view ;)

@Siddhesh I think your using the wrong mouse button? First click the model, then click the arrows button. Then you should get arrows that can you can drag around.
