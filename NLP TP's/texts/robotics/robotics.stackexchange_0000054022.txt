Please provide a list of your current parameters, as well as the specific device and firmware version for your Hokuyo.
Additionally, please check permissions on /dev/ttyACM0 by running 'sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0'.
It's also possible your laser is communicating using SCIP 1.0, please try updating the firmware on your laser to the latest version. See more information here:

In RVIZ, change the global frame_id to 'laser' and add a "New Display", and switch the topic to '/scan'
