Q:

How can I input joint angles to transformation matrix to get position in matlab?

I am trying to get the forward kinematics for a robot model in matlab (rigid body tree).
I created a 4 x4 transformation matrix from the base to the end-effector using the gettransform() function. I have 4 different joint angles to control. But how do I multiply the joint angles with the transformation matrix so that I get the correct orientation and position output of the end-effector?
Is there otherwise a better option to get the forward kinematics?
Thanks!

A:

After looking the documentation, in function gettransform you put your joint angle configuration there in radians.

Create the struct containing your join value
s = struct(nameofjoint1, valueofjoint1,..., nameofjointN, valueofjointN)

Get the position and orientation of your end-effector

    % Syntax

    % transform = getTransform(robot,jointconfiguration,startframe,lastframe)

    transform = getTransform(robot,s,'L1','L4')
