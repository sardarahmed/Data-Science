Q:

can't locate node [turtle_teleop_joy] in package [learning_joy]

Using Hydro on Precise. Following the tutorials on joystick operation here and here. The joystick works, roscore is running, joy_node is running, when I do rostopic echo joy I see the vectors change as I expect when the joystick controls are moved. When I run roslaunch learning_joy turtle_joy.launch however, the joystick still works, topic echo shows still sending, but no movement of the turtle.
I'm still on the steep part of the learning curve so I could be wrong, but might this be a path problem? I've changed the launch file as suggested here (joy to joy_node) and also changed the last line from turtle_teleop to learning_joy (missed that bit on the tutorial) but still not getting it right. here's my screenshot:

I have followed the very same example from the book "Learning ROS for Robotics Programming second edition on Jade on ubuntu 15.04. I am also having the similar problem. Someone please sort it out. Thanks.

I also had the same issue .I solved it  . After adding the the following lines(given below) in CMakeLists.txt . In the terminal  I wrote :
$ cd catkin_ws 
$ catkin_make
"add_executable(turtle_teleop_joy src/turtle_teleop_joy.cpp)
target_link_libraries(turtle_teleop_joy ${catkin_LIBRARIES})"

A:

The line from original tutorial launch-file (on the second link you gave)
<node pkg="turtle_teleop" type="turtle_teleop_joy" name="teleop"/>

tells roslaunch to start a node by running turtle_teleop_joy executable (type parameter) which is located within turtle_teleop package (pkg parameter). If you change pkg parameter on this line roslaunch will search for the executable within another package/folder, i.e. learning_joy. So, if there is no such executable (node) there, then roslaunch will issue an error.
