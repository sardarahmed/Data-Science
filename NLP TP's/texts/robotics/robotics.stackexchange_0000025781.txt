Q:

gap between sandia hand and robot hand mount

On both the left and right sides there seems to be about a 1cm gap between the sandia hand "palm" and the r_hand/l_hand part of the robot. Is this correct?
I launched the robot using drcsim-2.0 out of the box with

roslaunch atlas_utils atlas_sandia_hands.launch

Thanks,
Chris
