Q:

Object recognition kitchen capture orb_template

Hello everybody!
I'm trying to use the ORK on ubuntu 12.04 with ros Hydro.
I installed it using sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-object-recognition-*. I did not install couchapp (sudo pip install -U couchapp), as, if I understood well, it is not necessary.
Now, following this tutorial, I have a kinect connected to my computer and running:
rosrun openni_launch openni.launch

works properly, as I can see the depth image with image_view.
However, when I try to use the command:
rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_template -o my_textured_plane

what happens is that the depth image that appears is all black and the ORB window all red. Moreover I noticed that if I try to run this command with the image_view running and showing the depth image, the image_view stops to be updated, i.e. the openni.launch doesn't publish anymore the /camera/depth/image topic. Also when I stop running the orb_template command, the depth image topic still isn't published.
Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!!
EDIT:
this is the output of the command rosrun object_recognition_capture orb_template -o my_textured_plane

Are you using a 32 bit Ubuntu? Then it is a known Bug. Just install 64 bit Ubuntu and move on! See https://github.com/wg-perception/capture/issues/15#issuecomment-30496760
