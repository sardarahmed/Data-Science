Q:

CameraInfoManager is depreciated, what is replacing it?

The camera_info_manager webpage says CameraInfoManager class moved to the camera_info_manager namespace. For compatibility with ROS C Turtle, the global CameraInfoManager class name is still supported. It is deprecated in Electric Emys and will be removed in Fuerte.
Is this just a name change or is something different replacing it?
Thanks.

A:

It's just the rename to camera_info_manager::CameraInfoManager from CameraInfoManager.
