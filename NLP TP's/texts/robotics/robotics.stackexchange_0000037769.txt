Q:

voxel_grid visualization in rviz

Hi all!
I'm working with the navigation stacks, I made a costmap_2d/VoxelGrid with all my sensor data in it and I use this to navigate through the environment. I can see the laser and all my sensor in rviz but it would be nice to just visualize my costamp (VoxelGrid data type) instead of all the sensor separately. Is it possible to visualize the costamp_2d in rviz?? of is there any plug-in to convert my costmap in a data type that rviz can plot??
Thanks!

A:

I have not used it lately, but the costmap_2d_cloud utility included in the costmap_2d package can publish your grid contents as sensor_msgs::PointCloud.
