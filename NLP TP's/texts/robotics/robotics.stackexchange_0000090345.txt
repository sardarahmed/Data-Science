Q:

Autonomous car simulator with ROS bridge

Hi,
I have been working on Autonomous car project and looking for simulator.
Could you please suggest me simulators which has inbuilt rosbridge configured.
Currently I am using Carla simulator, but it is bit complex. I am looking for a simple and basic one.
Thank you,

@ahendrix Thanks for the input. As of now I am looking for a simple simulator with decent features so that I can test some of the basic algorithms. Later I can plan big and go for a simulator like Carla, Airsim etc which has better features.

A:

Autonomous cars are not simple projects, and any good simulation will take into account a lot of factors. I suggest you do a bit of research to choose a good simulator, and then learn to use it well.
