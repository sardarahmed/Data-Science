A:

@iandanforth's answer should work, but you don't even need to build from source. Just do:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ivcon ros-hydro-convex-decomposition

After that, the necessary binaries will be located in /opt/ros/hydro/bin, so if you've sourced setup.bash, they should be on your $PATH.
