Q:

nav2d installation

When I run the command line: roslaunch nav2d_tutorials tutorial1.launch
I get a lot of line that I don't understand where should I look at or how to fix the problem:
ResourceNotFound: p2os_urdf
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

I guess it is something related to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH but I'm not sure what the correct path should be!

A:

The ResourceNotFound error indicates that you're missing the p2os_urdf package. Is it installed?

How can I check (in which folder) that is installed or not ?
When I try: sudo find / -name p2os_urdf -type d then I can't see any path so I guess that is not installed.

You can try rospack find p2os_urdf to determine if a package is installed or not. In this particular case, it looks like the p2os_urdf package had a regression and was removed from the build farm for some reason: http://lists.ros.org/pipermail/ros-users/2015-November/069765.html

I've filed an issue against p2os for their regression: https://github.com/allenh1/p2os/issues/40 . Until that is fixed, you should probably install p2os from source.
