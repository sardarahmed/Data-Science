Hi @Yogesh Dusane,
You can use the RQT functionalities to generate a new plugin for this tool. However the new plugin will only work in the operational environment provided by RQT, thus you will not be able to use it as an independent component.
On the other hand, you have the possibility to generate a package that integrates ROS functionalities and Qt if that is what you want. You can find an example of this set up here.
Cheers.

any possibility to use rqt_plot, rqt_steering or their API in my own custom plugin for rqt?

I think that is not supported since the plugins are self contained.
A workaround would be to use their implementation into your plugin and add your custom functionalities.
