Q:

ros navigation driving principle

Hello.
I have one question.
As a mobile robot, I know about global plans and local plans.
How can I check whether the mobile robot is going correctly or not about the plan?
The environment is indoor, IMU, lidar, RGB-D.
I would appreciate it if you let me know the information.
If you let us know, you will be rich.
Please. ㅠㅠ
Thanks for reading.

That is extremely use-case specific and we cannot possibly tell you. If your robot has successfully created a plan and the controller is successfully moving the robot, why would you expect that the robot wouldn't be "going correctly about the plan"?
Certainly, there's a variety of ways that navigation may be suboptimal and you may want to detect such events, but again, very use-case specific we cannot answer.

How do you do it in general?
If the global plan is a straight line, you need to know if the robot is going straight, should it go straight, and if there's a little off-the-road, shouldn't there be a way to get back to the global plan?
