Q:

TurtleSim [rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node] doesn't work

I'm new to ROS and I'm trying to progress with the tutorial. Currently running Fuerte on Oneiric.
I was trying
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
and it gave me this:
(turtlesim_node:2972): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
(turtlesim_node:2972): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
(turtlesim_node:2972): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
(turtlesim_node:2972): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "pixmap",
[ INFO] [1335672726.805592379]: Starting turtlesim with node name /turtlesim
[ INFO] [1335672726.839701257]: Spawning turtle [turtle1] at x=[inf], y=[inf], theta=[0.000000]
and a blue screen with nothing in it. This is what it meant to be:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes
I did run a core and make Turtlesim before running and I don't really know what's going on... Thanks in advance.
P.S. I was reading other posts and some claimed that there is a problem with the tutorials. But those posts were about 2 to 3 yrs old...

A:

Same problem. I solved it by installing package gtk2-engines-pixbuf from Ubuntu Software Center.
I hope that it helps.
