Q:

model.xml missing in Using urdf with robot_state_publisher

Hi,
I am trying to follow the Using urdf with robot_state_publisher  tutorial.
The required model.xml file mentioned in turial is missing.
Is there any way it can be obtained?

A:

The model.xml file isn't missing, the links to it on that page weren't working anymore (probably related to #q275773).
I've fixed the links, so you should be able to download the file again.
