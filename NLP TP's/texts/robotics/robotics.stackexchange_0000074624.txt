A:

No. ROS handles distributed processing "out of the box" (in this case, ROS nodes both on the robot and on your PC). You need to read the basic documentation and gain a working understanding of ROS nodes, the ROS master, and pub/sub functionality (at a minimum). Try starting at the ROS core components page and go from there.
Also, directly (1st sentence) from the rosbridge wiki page: Rosbridge provides a JSON API to ROS functionality for non-ROS programs. Which is quite clearly not what you need.
