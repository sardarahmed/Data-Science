Q:

No module named srv

I was following the tutorial WrittingServiceClient(Python). I have typed the code as it is. The project "makes" properly also, but when I try to rosrun the server or the client the following error shows:
from beginner_tutorials import *
ImportError: No module named srv
Where am I going wrong? How to create the module srv?
N.B.: I have followed the tutorial "Creating a ROS msg and srv" and the srv file exists inside the beginner_tutorials/srv

In my case, I had to source the devel/setup.bash in each instance of the console I was calling the scripts from. Once for the client, once for the server. Then, it worked for me.

A:

I had this error because of module name conflict.
e.g.:
catkin_ws/
  | src/
    | package/
      | srv/
        | service.srv
      | scripts
        | package.py
        | code_using_service.py

I was importing the service into the code_using_service.py file and got the error message:
from package.srv import *
ImportError: No module named srv

It was looking for the srv module inside my package.py module instead of inside my package/ module. So I just renamed my script file to package_node.py to avoid the conflict.

This was my problem. To fix it I had to not only rename the script, but also make sure any pyc files were removed.

Service name and package name can be the same, right?

This solved it for me. I had a .py file named the same as the package name, which then made the script try to import the python file, and not the .srv file from the /srv folder. Thank you
