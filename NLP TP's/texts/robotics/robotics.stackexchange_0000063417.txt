A:

Baxter simulator is only available to the robot owners who have an access to the serial number (see http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Simulator_Installation):
Request access to the simulator repository by emailing RSDK.support@rethinkrobotics.com with your organization name and Baxter serial number and your github.com username.

By the way,can I install RSDK and use the gazebo simulator without owning a Research robot?

For that you should contact the customer support at Rethink. And if you found an answer helpful enough, mark the "check" sign so that others know the question is answered ;)
