Q:

the way to check which planner is selected

This question has relation to my former question ( http://answers.ros.org/question/152196/about-a-way-to-change-default-global-planner/ ).  I want to confirm which planner is selected. I selected the eband_local_planner and carrot_planner in Rviz and added the definition of eband_local_planner param name="base_local_planner" value="eband_local_planner/EBandPlannerROS"  and  param name="base_global_planner" value="carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner"to move_base.launch.xml , but following is displayed on a terminal.

ken@ken:~$ rostopic echo /move_base/parameter_descriptions

dflt: 
  bools: 
    - 
      name: recovery_behavior_enabled
      value: True
    - 
      name: clearing_rotation_allowed
      value: True
    - 
      name: shutdown_costmaps
      value: False
    - 
      name: restore_defaults
      value: False
  ints: []
  strs: 
    - 
      name: base_global_planner
      value: navfn/NavfnROS
    - 
      name: base_local_planner
      value: base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS

Could anybody tell me the way to check which planner is selected if I'm wrong?
I think that a dflt means initial value.

I'm sorry, it was simple. I can check them with a following topic.
