Q:

how to use roscd with folders which are not ros nodes?

Hi all,
I am currently using ROS in conjunction with Genom. However, Genom doesn't have an equivalent to roscd. I would like to know if there is a way to use roscd to fastly go into Genom module folders.

A:

Hi,
Just add a magical fake manifest.xml file to your folder. And be sure to put the name of your folder in the manifest at the right places (refere to an example manifest to see where the package name must appear).

Yes indeed. You are disguising your folders into ros packages.

So essentially, you are turning your folder into a ROS package. (What is a ROS package other than a folder with a manifest.xml in it?)
