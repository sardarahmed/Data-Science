Q:

How to turn a rover 90 degrees using wheel encoders?

I have a four wheel DC rover with two optical wheel encoders.  I'm executing rover turns by controlling the direction of wheel motion on either side of the rover.  To turn left, all wheels on the left rotate backwards while all right wheels rotate forward.  This allows to rover to remain relatively in the same position while turning.  The directions are reversed to do a right turn.  
How can I use these two sensors to execute as close to a 90 degree turn as possible without fusing additional sensor data?

A:

All theory aside, circumferences and actual distances travelled will vary with your wheel geometry since your wheels aren't perfectly tangential to their direction of travel while turning.  While Ian gives some good math I think I would run tests and assign a pseudo-circumference. 
I think I would just measure what the odometers read for a full 360 turn-about and then divide that up as necessary.
Also, I'd bet that different floors would give different performance from your off-tangent wheels and your pseudo circumference is probably dependent on that.
