Q:

How to delete an attachment on the wiki?

It could be that I'm missing something, but does anyone know how to delete an attachment from a wiki page? Clicking the del link on the attachment page of the wiki page takes me back to the wiki page itself with an error admonition at the top stating:

Please use the interactive user interface to use action AttachFile.del!
Clear message

I've found some posts to the moin-user list mentioning this same error message [1], but no solution / work-around I can use.
Any ideas?
