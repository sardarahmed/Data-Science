Q:

How to Unbuild Packages

I want to take some packages off the build farm. I tried moving the package.xmls to package.xml.NOBUILD (as I've seen done) but after I prepare my catkin release, the packages won't bloom-release.
==> git push --tags

A:

To remove something from the buildfarm remove it from the rosdistro.
To tell bloom to ignore it in the future you can use a hydro.ignored in your gbp repo: https://github.com/ros-gbp/ros_comm-release

What if I only want to remove some of the packages from the "stack"?
Comment by tfoote on 2013-12-29:
Only remove those packages from the rosdistro file. They are listed explicitly https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/hydro/release.yaml#L1229 in the release.yaml
