Q:

How to set the initial pose for the robot in navigation?

Hi! I followed the tutorials of navigation , but I meet some problems. I joysticked the robot and used Gmapping to generate a map . Next I turn off the robot and restart it . The laser scan and odometry work well. Then I use that map with AMCL. When I load the map with Map_Sever,the rviz shows that  the robot always stays in the original point of the map by defalut although the robot is in other places actually.I donot know how to set the initial pose for the robot . Can the robot match the laser date with the environment of the map and make itself localized autonomously ? Or do I need to set the initialpose for the robot manully?
Any suggestion will be appreciated!Thank you very much!

A:

Having the robot figure out where it is on startup is known as the "kidnapped robot problem" in robotics. AMCL does not solve it, so you'll have to set the pose manually or find a different localization package that does solve this problem.
You can set the robot's pose manually using the "2D Pose Estimate" tool in rviz.

Is there a solution for this in ROS? It's something I would like my robot to achieve.
