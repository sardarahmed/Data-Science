Q:

costmap_2d local into image

Hello everyone,
I was wondering if there is already a function to convert the costmap_2d data into a image (or other kind of matrix, so that it is easier to search through).
I have managed to subscribe to the local costmap_2d and wanted to check particular areas by myself now. Unfortunately the format that I receive the costmap in is not very intuitive (at least for me). I was wondering if there is a simple conversion. If not, where can I find the convention on how the information is stored (columns, rows, height, width)?
here I saw it must be possible, just that I don t know how.
I am running ros hydro
Kind regards,
Marcus
