Q:

"intersect" several transformations

Hi all,
I have a node that will lookafter two transformations. My problem is that both have different frequencies and I with the information os these two I have to publish a new one. So I want to know what is the best way to publish the new one, what timestamp should I define to the new one for example.
Thanks for your help
Pedro

A:

If you are willing to dig into code, the robot_pose_ekf code shows how to combine different data streams.
A rough idea:
Look at all time stamps from all incoming data eg. time_A, time_B, time_C. Pick those that are not too old (ie within your timeout range from current_time). Finally, use the min of the valid timestamps vs current_time eg. if time_C is outside the timeout range, your output timestamp will be min(current_time, time_A, time_B)
