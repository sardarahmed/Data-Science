Q:

Anyone tried tabletop_object_detector for Kinect based pointclouds

Hi,
Does the tabletop_object_detector work for the point clouds given by the Kinect? Has anyone tried and succeeded in detecting objects. I have this doubt as its not mentioned in the wiki.
Thanks,
Karthik

How can I do this ??

Any point cloud will do.  Just remap cloud_in to be your kinect point cloud.  (Which you can generate by launching openni.launch in package openni_launch.)
