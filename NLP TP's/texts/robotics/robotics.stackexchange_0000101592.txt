Q:

What happens when rosbag record runs out of diskspace?

Hi,
what will happen if I rosbag record ROS topics and don't have enough memory to store it? Will rosbag overwrite something  or will automatic shutdown command ?
Kind regards

Will rosbag overwrite something [..]?

you mean random other files on your file system?
No, that's not what will happen. I know of no program that would do that.

Edit: I've updated the title of your post, as "rosbag question" doesn't really capture what you really want to know -- and is too generic in any case.

A:

I think the option --max-splits=MAX_SPLITS solves this problem for you:

Split bag at most MAX_SPLITS times,
then begin deleting the oldest files.
This creates a fixed size or duration
recording.

 rosbag record --split --size 1024 --max-splits 3 /chatter for size (in MB)
rosbag record --split --duration 10m --max-splits 6 /chatter for duration (in minutes)
