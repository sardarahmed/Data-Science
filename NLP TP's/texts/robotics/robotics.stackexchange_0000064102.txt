Q:

Are there any unofficial distributions of ros?

I know the official distributions like Groovy or Hydro, but are there any other unofficial distributions?
We all know that Linux have many distributions. So I guess unofficial distributions may be exist.
Looking forward to the answers.
Thank you.

Besides robot-specific ones I'm not aware of many ROS distros, mainly because packages usually are not mutually exclusive. The only thing you'd change would be drivers/algorithms. AFAIK there is only one core ROS implemen
