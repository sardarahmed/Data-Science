 roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch

Comment by hsu on 2011-08-25:
pr2_empty_world.launch includes pr2.launch, so you are in effect launching some of the nodes twice, hence the errors.  You have to setup something like the multi_robot_test.launch instead.

A:

There is a multi_robot_test.launch that works with trunk of simulator_gazebo.  It starts up 3 robots under separate ros namespaces.
I basically started with standard pr2_empty_world.launch and namespaced nodes / added tf_prefixes.
robots spawn and pieces of it are controllable if you configure your teleop to work under a namespace, but otherwise much of this is untested.
