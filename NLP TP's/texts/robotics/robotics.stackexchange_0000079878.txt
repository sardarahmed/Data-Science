Q:

Using custom fields in a ROS service

I'm trying to create a service to handle point clouds. Ideally I'd use a pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZI> but I'll even settle for sensor_msgs::PointCloud2.
When I try and create my service.srv as:
sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 cloud_in
---
sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 cloud_out

I get
error: <class 'genmsg.base.InvalidMsgSpec'>: sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 is not a legal message field type

EDIT:
the correct format should be sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 cloud_in

Try changing sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 to sensor_msgs/PointCloud2.
