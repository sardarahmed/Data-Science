Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: uvc_camera

I was happily using uvc_camera in my development.
Everything was working ok. Then I performed a
linux upgrade that said one package was being removed
and now I don't have uvc_camera.
I don't seem to be able to down load it from
camera_umd.
Is there a replacement?
I have tried upgrading to electric but that doesn't have uvc_camera.
Also I now cannot rosmake my code. the package seems to have cturtle
hard coded. is there a upgrade process for taking packages built
on one version to work on a later version.

A:

Are you using ROS's unstable distribution on Ubuntu 11.10? If so, the immediate problem is that the image_common stack isn't yet building for that combination of ROS and Ubuntu.
You might have better luck with another UVC driver if you find one that doesn't use image_transport (for JPEG/Theora streams) or camera_info_manager (for CameraInfo), but anything that uses those or other components of image_common will be missing from the deb repository.
Alternatively, you could try building image_common and camera_umd from source, or you could switch to electric.
