Q:

Can the email header for announcements be changed?

Is there any way to modify the email header for answers.ros.org that announces new questions and answers?  I just have everything forwarded to my email, and I'd prefer threading to work properly, but the headers are different enough that gmail does not thread them together, so I have 2 threads now for every topic.
