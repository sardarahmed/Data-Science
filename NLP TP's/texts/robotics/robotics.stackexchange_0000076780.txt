Q:

How can we know the release date of apt repository

Hi,
I'd like to know exact timing of releasing apt repositories for both "ros" and "ros-shadow-fixed".
Is there any trigger or hook by which we can know exact time when new list of apt packages are released?
Thank you in advance.

A:

Afaik there is no hookable infrastructure, but the syncs are announced on the ROS Discourse site in the release category.
Note that these announcements cover the main ROS package repositories only. Mirrors might need additional time to catch up with their sources.
