Q:

how many reference images used in kinectï¼Ÿ

I want to construct a depth camera like kinect.

One referece image is sanped at a distance of 100cm, and servel test images are snapped at different distances. I found if the test image with a distance not similar to 100cm, the disparity can not be calculated correctly. Whether I miss something when I calculate the disparity?

Is there someone konw how many reference images kinect used?

A:

This paper provides a good overview of the Kinect measurement model:
Accuracy and Resolution of Kinect Depth Data for Indoor Mapping Applications
In the paper, the authors refer to a parameter Z_0, or the distance to the reference plane. I assume this is what you're asking about. They calibrate for the depth readings, so if you go through the equations, you can find the value of Z_0.
Now in the model the authors describe, they only use a single Z_0. However, it is entirely possible that the Kinect uses multiple and switches dynamically, but that could be hidden from the user.
