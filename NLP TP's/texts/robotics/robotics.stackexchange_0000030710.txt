Q:

Running rviz - couldn't find executable

Dear ROS users,
as I would like to make use of rviz visualization tool but am new to Linux, I kindly ask you for help. As I type "rosrun rviz rviz" in the terminal window, I get the following message:
youbot@oleksandr-laptop:~$ rosrun rviz rviz
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rviz below /home/youbot/ros_stacks/rviz
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/youbot/ros_stacks/rviz
[rosrun]   /home/youbot/ros_stacks/rviz/src/rviz
The contents of the folder /home/youbot/ros_stacks/rviz are as follows:
folders: bin, build, images, lib, ogre_media, scripts, src, test, ui
files (outside folders): CMakeLists.txt, mainpage.dox, manifest.xml
Hope for your reply!
P.S. I'm using Ubuntu 10.04

A:

How did you do your installation? From SVN or from Ubuntu Packages, if you're using Ubuntu 10.04 it's advised to install from Ubuntu packages as explained here.
If you have an installation from svn, you need to build rviz first, you can do this by doing:
roscd rviz
rosmake --rosdep-install

Your username suggest you are doing this on a youbot platform, this is not advised as the youbot mini-itx is limited in resources, it's better to do your installation on a laptop and run only the roscore and drivers (you can find our drivers in kul-ros-pkg) on the youbot. By setting the ROS_MASTER_URI on your laptop you can still connect to the youbot and visualize all data on your laptop.
