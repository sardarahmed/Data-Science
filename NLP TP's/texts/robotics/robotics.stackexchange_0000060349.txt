Q:

Can we install player/stage and Ros in a same system?

Is there any problem in installing player/stage to a computer with ROS? We are using two version of ROS.
Hydro in Ubuntu 12.04(32bit and 64bit) and Indigo in Ubuntu 14.04(32 bit)

A:

No problem. I am using stage with Hydro and Indigo as well. Not sure what the exact differences are, but I am using the "ros version" of stage (http://wiki.ros.org/stage) and the ros-stage interface (http://wiki.ros.org/stage_ros).
Good luck!
