Q:

Catkin_make does not build rtabmap_rosÂ¿

Hello, this question is pretty similar to this one: http://answers.ros.org/question/233494/catkin_make-command-doesnt-work/
although in my case I believe the package.xml is correctly set.
My problem is that when I run catkin_make it jumps over the rtabmap_ros package, with no output.
However, if I run catkin_make --pkg rtabmap_ros it says that the "catkin_ws/src/build/rtabmap_ros" folder does not exist, which of course is true as the command is supposed to build the project. The folder rtabmap_ros is directly downloaded from the repository and it works perfectly in my other computer.
Any ideas about how to proceed?
Cheers

A:

Try cleanup the catkin build directory and make again:
$ rm -r catkin_ws/src/build/*
$ cd catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
