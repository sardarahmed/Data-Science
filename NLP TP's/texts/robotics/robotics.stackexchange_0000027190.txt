Q:

simulink model as GAZEBO plugin

Hello all
Is it possible to connect simulink to gazebo as a plugin ?
for example if i like to model a nonlinear spring using simulink
and include it as part of my robot ?
Does anyone have an idea if and how it can be done ?
thanks

Hi,
i didn't made anything like that for Gazebo, but i suppose what you need is Gazebo model plugin which will communicate with Matlab. Communication itself can be done in different way i think, e.g. all kind of: pipes, IPC, udp over network, etc.
Call MATLAB Functions from C and C++ Applications
C/C++ Wrapper for SIMULINK models
Also you can probably split this task in two pieces and communicate using gazebo topics, than you need to implement Simulink S-Function block which will publish data you need to model plugin. E.g something like that:
ROS/Matlab Simulink communication
And connect this block to the outputs of your model.
Hope this helps.

I can say first hand, that trying to use gazebo functionality within a S-function will not work. At run time the library libgdal.so.1 will have a couple undefined symbols to a library (cannot remember the name lets call it libA.so) and you cannot symbolically link to libA.so from an external directoy that can resolve the undefined symbol because libA.so already exists within the matlab directory and it has slightly different definitions that are needed by other libraries within matlab.

^ Adding to the previous comment, if anyone has figured a way to get passed needing to use libgdal with gazebo on a ubuntu installation please give some insight :)
