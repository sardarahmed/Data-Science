Q:

how to start rostest file on startup?

Has anybody implemented the rostest file that would be launched on startup? All I did now was to type the command make run_tests in the build folder of the workspace manually. I want the file to be automatically run when my machine boots up. Any help would be appreciated, and let me know if you need any details from me.

rostest was not designed to be used like this, and there's probably a better way to do it. What are you actually trying to do? (This sounds like an XY problem )

I want my machine to auto-check every component (e.g. thruster and gps) in order to ensure that each part works properly and provide end users with a checklist

A:

rostest is meant for running unit and integration tests, either manually or within a Continuous Integration process. It isn't designed for running live tests at startup.
I'd suggest you use the diagnostics and self_test packages for reporting issues to users and running self-tests at startup.
the diagnostics package in particular is designed for continuous monitoring and reporting of issues, and provides the diagnostic_aggregator for validating and formatting diagnostics, and rqt_robot_monitor for displaying those diagnostics to users.
