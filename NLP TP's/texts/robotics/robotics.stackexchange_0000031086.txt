Q:

[openni_tracker] InitFromXml failed: Can't create any node of the requested type!

I'm trying to use the openni_tracker node in the openni_kinect stack but when I try and run it I get the following error message:

InitFromXml failed: Can't create any node of the requested type!

I'm using ros-diamondback and I'm trying to use openni_tracker with the kinect. This is really frustrating because I already had it working. Any help on why I'm getting this error would be appreciated.
Also, because openni_tracker doesn't display a view of the camera's image I was wondering if there was an easily accessible node that could display the skeleton tracking image tracker is based on.
Thanks
Anthony

You need to register the license key for the dev modules.
"sudo niLicense -l 0KOIk2JeIBYClPWVnMoRKn5cdY4="

The command itself worked for my turtlebot/Ubuntu, with exactly the same values without double-quotation, showing PrimeSense being associated with the key. However I still get the same error.
