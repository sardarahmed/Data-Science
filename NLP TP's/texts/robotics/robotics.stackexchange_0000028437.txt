Would you mind posting the output of the following commands?
apt show libignition-math*

ldd $(which gazebo)

@sloretz Edited my OP with results. Thanks for looking into this!

A:

libignition-math4.so.4 => /usr/local/lib/libignition-math4.so.4

Looks like at some point ignition-math4 was installed from source - it has the prefix /usr/local/lib. If installed via apt it would be in /usr/lib.
It probably was built before this pull request was merged. If the build folder is still around then do sudo make uninstall to uninstall it. Otherwise you'll have to find and delete its files manually. This list is probably incomplete:
/usr/local/share/doc/libignition-math4
/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libignition-math4.so.4.0.0
/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libignition-math4.so.4
/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/ignition-math4/*
/usr/local/include/ignition/math4/*

Then I would force reinstall ignition-math4 in case something from it accidentally got deleted
sudo apt-get --reinstall install libignition-math4*
