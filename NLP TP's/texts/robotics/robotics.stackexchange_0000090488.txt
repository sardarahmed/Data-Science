Q:

Is it possible to have Indigo or Hydro along with Kinetic on ubuntu 16.04?

I need to stimulate the 1st edition Darwin OP, but it requires ROS Hydro or Indigo. The installation states the packages cant be found. I know they are meant for older versions of Ubuntu, but would it be possible to install them?

A:

Why don't you try docker? I run all the ROS stuff under docker so it doesn't kill my OpenCV library
