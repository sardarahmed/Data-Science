Q:

Why wouldn't my robot stop?

I am working on an Arduino based robot which engages a braking mechanism detecting anything in front. I was using an ultrasonic sensor, to detect obstacles which worked well while the robot was on my table (i.e under construction). But when I ran it on the ground, it doesn't stops and crashes.
The robot is programmed as if anything is detected 50 cm ahead if the robot, the braking mechanism stops the wheels. But when testing, the robot just wouldn't stop.
My robot is running at an average 7.5m/s . Thinking that doppler's effect might have rendered my sensor useless, I tried a little IR sensor I had lying around (range 25 cm approx), but that didn't work as well.
What am I doing wrong here?

A:

7.5m/s is pretty fast for a robot, but still not that much compared to speed of sound (approx. 330m/s), so Doppler effect may introduce some error to measurments, but not critical. The point is that if you set detection distance to only 50cm, your robot has only some 66ms to:

perform the measurment
communicate with the sensor, or make a AD conversion
run the algorithm
send a command to motor driver
stop motors and decelarate

Even if it starts braking immidately, its inertia may be to big to decelerate completely before cruching into the obstacle. Would a car driving 7.5m/s (27km/h) stop in a distance o 0,5m? 
Suggested soultions:

Try increasing a detection distance
Try using a IR sensor with a digital interface - they measurment times are much lower than in US sensors
If you have to brake really quickly, think of using additional mechanical brakes
