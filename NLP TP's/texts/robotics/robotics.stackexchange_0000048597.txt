Q:

Can I dynamically set a parameter for c++ node?

I have c++ node running, I am wondering can I change value of a parameter(define value in launch file) dynamically in that node(which means take effect without relaunch the launch file)?
Thanks in advance!

A:

You can change the parameter on the parameter server anytime you want, but unless your node checks for changes, it won't know about it. For values that you expect to change during execution, dynamic_reconfigure is a better option.

Also, you can call getParamCached() anytime a new value might be worth using. Don't use getParam() in that case, it would hammer the parameter server too hard.
