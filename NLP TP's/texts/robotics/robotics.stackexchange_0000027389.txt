Q:

How to manipulate joints in a simple legged model

What's the easiest way to programmatically manipulate a legged model? Through the excellent "build a robot" tutorial, I was able to build a simple four-legged platform. How would I manipulating the limbs to test different gaits?
I've read through some of the other tutorials, and I'm a little confused on how to proceed. Do I write a model plugin, or connect it to ROS...or both?
I'm not trying to do anything fancy. I just want to be able to write a simple program to extend/retract/rotate legs in different sequences.

A:

A model plugin should work for you. Just use Joint::SetVelocity or Joint::SetForce.
See the DiffDrivePlugin for an example.
