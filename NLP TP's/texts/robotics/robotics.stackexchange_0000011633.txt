Q:

Alternatives to Kalmam Filter

I am currently working on a self balancing robot project. I am going to use a MPU6050 to get data from both the accelerometer and the gyroscope. Since I need to get accurate data in a very small amount of data I need to filter the raw data I get. So many people have suggested me to use the Kalman Filter but I could not comprehend it (the maths behind it). Are there any other types of filters I can use in my project?
Thanks in advance.

A:

A good choice for sensor fusion with the MPU6050 is a second order complementary filter, which I used for the orientation estimation in a project. The complementary filter is computational cheap and so a good choice for a microcontroller. A paper about the implementation you can find here:
