Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: 2D Mapping

Is there a way (or any example) to build a 2D map using Senz3D camera without using SLAM?
Thank you

A:

You can use this driver - https://github.com/ipa320/softkinetic - to get a pointcloud from the camera. I'm not sure why it's not released as a ROS package, perhaps there are still issues to work out.
Sure, you can convert a single pointcloud into a flat 2D map. However without SLAM you will not be able to properly stitch multiple clouds together to obtain a combined map, so you will be limited by the sensor's FOV and occlusion.
