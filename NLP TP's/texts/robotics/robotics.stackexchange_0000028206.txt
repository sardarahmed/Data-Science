Q:

how to use roslaunch having gazebo on verbose mode?

Dear all,
when you develop plugins in gazebo, you can get the verbose feedback by executing:
gazebo my_world.world --verbose

When we use roslaunch to launch the gazebo simulation, do you know a similar way to get verbose feedback?
I tried to find a simial input arg but I couldn't since debug means different thing.
(using gazebo7.8 and ros kinetic)

A:

You can add extra_gazebo_args:="--verbose" to your roslaunch command.

I've tested this parameter extra_gazebo_args:="--verbose" on ROS Kinetic with Gazebo 7.15.0 but at the end --verbose is not passed to gzserver. Do we need a specific ROS or Gazebo version for that?
