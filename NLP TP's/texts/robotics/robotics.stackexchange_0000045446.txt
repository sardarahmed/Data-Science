Q:

programming question

Hi everybody
I understand ROS is an operating system for robots. I have installed it both on a robot and on a linux machine.
I want to write a program that will give me information from the robot's camera(s) and sensors. This program will be a user interface of what the robot sees and senses.
My question might sound very stupid but I have to ask this so I can get it clear in my head: Do I use ROS to write this "user interface program" or do I use a regular programming language like C++ to do this?
Thank you all

A:

Have a look at the ros wiki to find out more about what ros actually is, in particular this page.
ROS is not a specific programming language. It is a set of utilities and libraries for implementing all different kinds of functionality on robots. Among other things, it provides many C++ libraries.
