Q:

cvAlign Question

Short version: Hello, I was wondering what cvAlign does in the inner functions.
Long version:
I've been looking at cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK code and there's a function
pyrA = cvGetMat( pyrA, &pstubA );

if( pyrA->step*pyrA->height < icvMinimalPyramidSize( imgSize ) )
    CV_Error( CV_StsBadArg, "pyramid A has insufficient size" );

which then leads to this:
static int icvMinimalPyramidSize( CvSize imgSize )
{
    return cvAlign(imgSize.width,8) * imgSize.height / 3;
}

can anyone tell me what cvAlign does (is it bit alignment)?

A:

Okay I solved my problem.  It seems for Python, at least where I'm running ROS's OpenCV for Python, the images and the pyramids are mixed up if you got the error:  error: pyramid A has insufficient size. So wherever you would put your images, you would then put your pyramids and viceversa.
