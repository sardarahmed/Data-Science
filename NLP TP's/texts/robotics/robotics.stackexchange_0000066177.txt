Q:

Rospy Services with method class

Hi,
How can i use a class method for rospy.Service()?
The .srv file is
int64 a
int64 b
---
bool response

The code in the server.py is
s = rospy.Service('setVelocity', SetVelocity, self.setVelocity)

The signature of the setVelocity method
def setVelocity (self, r, l)

In the client.py i've
s = rospy.ServiceProxy('setVelocity', SetVelocity)
s(3,5)

and i get this error:
error processing request: setVelocity() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)

Sorry for my bad english

A:

The service callback should only take one argument other than self, which will be of type [YourService]Request.
