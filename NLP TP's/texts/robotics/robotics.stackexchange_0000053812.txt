Q:

Adding more packages to a wstool generated workspace

I have made a source build of hydro using the instructions here (substituting hydro for groovy):
http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Source
I followed REP 131 and only made a rosinstall including viz.
However, now I would like to add perception to the workspace.  So I created a new rosinstall as such:

~/ros_catkin_ws$ rosinstall_generator perception --rosdistro hydro --deps --wet-only > hydro-perception-wet.rosinstall

~/ros_catkin_ws$ wstool init -j8 src hydro-perception-wet.rosinstall

But when I tried that I got the following error:

Error: There already is a workspace config file .rosinstall at "src". Use wstool install/modify.

I tried looking for documentation of wstool here:
http://wiki.ros.org/wstool
But the documentation is sparse.  When I type wstool help, I don't see either install or modify as options.
Is there a way to build upon a previous wstool-created workspace or do I need to make a ros_catkin_ws_2 or something like that?
Any help would be appreciated!

A:

Based on dornhege's answer, I was able to use the following:

~/ros_catkin_ws$ wstool merge hydro-perception-wet.rosinstall -t src

~/ros_catkin_ws$ wstool update -j 4 -t src
