Q:

TurtleBot USB Connection - No Data

Hi!
I'm trying to get a Roomba 555 with Turtlebot power board to work, but keep getting the following message:
"Failed to contact device with error: [Error reading from SCI port. No data.]. Please check that the Create is powered on and that the connector is plugged into the Create."
I connected the Turtlebot to a Dell Inspiron 6400, running Ubuntu 10.04 and ROS diamondback.
My serial device looks like this:
crw-rw-rw- 1 root mate 188, 0 2011-11-03 10:48 /dev/ttyUSB0
As listed in lsusb:
Bus 004 Device 006: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC
I've tried the traditional fixes, such as restarting, unplugging-replugging, looked at dmesg, but no clues.
Any ideas how I could fix this would be very much appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Máté

A:

Check that the iRobot Create is turned on. ( The green light should be on next to the power button.)

Hi ROS community !
I have the same problem here, on an eu turtlebot 1 (based on roomba 521).
I think is correctly turned on and i can see the ttyUSB0 file in /dev.
I think is cause of the board, it's an old turtlebot.eu card on which I can't find any information on the internet.
Thx !
