Q:

Symbol 'subscribe' could not be resolved

Hello,
I am trying to subscribe to a topic, namely nav_msgs::Odometry.
subodom = nh_.subscribe<nav_msgs::Odometry> ("RosAria/pose", 1,  &SensorSonar::callback, this);
Strangely I get this error message:
Description   Resource    Path    Location    Type
Symbol 'subscribe' could not be resolved libSENSOR.h    /mmrprojekt/src line 79 Semantic Error
Just one line bellow I subscurbe to another Topic without any problem.
sub = nh_.subscribe <sensor_msgs::PointCloud>  ("/RosAria/sonar",1, &SensorSonar::callback, this);
Any ideas?
BR

A:

You are using the same callback for both subscribes. I would guess, that the parameter only fits one of those, so that the signature of the templated method does not match the given callback.
