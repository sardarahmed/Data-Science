Q:

catkin generating lib packages instead of bin packages

Hello all;
I am starting with ROS, groovy version.
I have managed to compile some code in a package using catkin, but the executables generated are placed ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/package_name.
In my CmakeLists.txt I have used "add_executable" and "target_link_libraries"
I think the executables should be in ~/catkin_ws/devel/bin/package_name., instead under lib directory.
Is this correct? Where could I have the error?
Thank you all in advance,
Best Regards,

A:

AFAIK this is correct and not an error at your side, although a bit ugly.
My guess is that this is used to not pollute the namespace in $PATH that adds bin/... and only run nodes via rosrun. A comment from the developers would be nice.

Not a developer, but I've been documenting catkin lately. Here's my current draft, which agrees with your answer: http://farnsworth.csres.utexas.edu/docs/catkin/html/howto/building_executables.html#installing
