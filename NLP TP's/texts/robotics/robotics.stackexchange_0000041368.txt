Q:

Using rgbdslam with .oni files

Hello,
I needed to use the rgbd slam package with .oni files. After some hours of searching, I couldn't find any real help for this. Finally I figured out how to do it and it turned out that it's pretty simple. In fact, it's enough to add the following line to openni_nodelet.cpp:
device_ = driver.createVirtualDevice("yourONIfile.oni",true/false,true/false);
in the OpenNINodelet::setupDevice method as an alternative to the existing getDeviceBy options.
Finally, rebuild the openni_camera package (do not forget to move ROS_NOBUILD to ROS_NOBUILD_BAK or to delete it).
Hope this can be helpful!
Best

A:

FYI, I used your proposal to create a patch for openni_camera, by applying the patch you can use the openni_launch toolchain and let the openni_camera nodelet read from an oni file:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch device_id:=/path/to/your/file.oni

You can find the patch attached to this ticket: https://kforge.ros.org/openni/trac/ticket/60
