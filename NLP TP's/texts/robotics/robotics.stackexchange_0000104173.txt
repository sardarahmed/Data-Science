Q:

What are these parts called?

This is a part to a toy that as you can see is pretty well damaged. I'd like to get a replacement but I dont know what this is even called. From this picture, google lens found something called a "reversing screw" which looks similar. I also found results for "scrolling camshaft" and "worm shaft" that look kind of like this too. Its about 3 inches from end to end and has a hex channel in the center where the motor attaches.
The part is connected to an electric motor that spins it. There is a square plastic part with a hole in the middle that moves up and down on this part. This movement is via a small metal semicircular "fork" that looks like --C where the C part moves in the grooves of this piece and the -- part is in the square plastic.
While I was inspecting the damage on this part, I managed to lose the --C so I need to replace that as well, but I cant find any name for it.  Since these are small mechanical parts driven by an electric motor I figured this may be the best audience to ask. Can someone put a name to the piece shown and/or the --C so I can try to locate replacements?

A:

The picture shows a barrel cam.
The --C is a cam follower.
The cam is very likely a custom part.
You could try to have the cam 3d printed.
