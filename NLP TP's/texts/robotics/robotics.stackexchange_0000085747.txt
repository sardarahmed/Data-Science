Q:

is it possible to define custom costmap values?

Hallo
I want to define custom value for for the costmap.
In costmap2D API there are 4 special values:
static const unsigned char NO_INFORMATION = 255;
static const unsigned char LETHAL_OBSTACLE = 254;
static const unsigned char INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLE = 253;
static const unsigned char FREE_SPACE = 0;
How can i define my particular costmap value ?
thanks

There's nothing stopping you from saying const unsigned char FOO=42 but I have the feeling you mean something deeper. What do you want that value to do?

yes you are right,case is deeper.I want to integrate/use that custom value in the global path planner. Global path planner should create ways on this new defined const unsigned char.The Question is: is it possible and which files should be manipulated?(except costvalues.p, costmap_2d_publisher.cpp )

A:

You have to do two separate things:

You have to get the value into the costmap (if it is not already in the costmap). You could start here
You have to get the global planner to see the value and act differently because of it. That's a semi-complex operation, but I would look here to start.

Is there a way to do this to create "virtual preferred paths"?
