Q:

Problem in building imported catkin workspace - Can't see "Fixing Preprocessor ..." in "Projct properties"

Hi,
I have read and followed several instructions for importing my catkin workspace in Eclipse. Including:
[1] http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#Eclipse
[2] http://cs460.coins-lab.org/index.php?title=Eclipse
So I have got the required knowledge.
Then I have successfully built Eclipse project files and imported my ~/catkin_ws/build directory into Eclipse.
I am, however, unable to build my ROS workspace and Projects.
In addition, when I want to "Fix Preprocessor Include Paths" at:
Project Properties --> C/C++ General --> Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros, etc. --> Providers tab.
Even I can not see the " Preprocessor Include Paths, Macros, etc" item.
Can anyone help me in this case?
Best regards
Reza

A:

I would recommend using the ROS Qt Creator Plugin for ROS Development. I just released the latest version with a custom installers found here. I am still updating the wiki to reflect this change but this walks you through the installer process but download the Online Installer from the previous link.
