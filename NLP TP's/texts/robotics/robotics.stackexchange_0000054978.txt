Q:

How to mark a given location as obstacle

Right now i have a robot that stops when it detects a person.  I need to be able to mark a coordinate as obstacles, even though it still is not an obstacle.  This is because im predicting the behavior of the person so i need to mark as obstacles the path i think it will walk.  Any ideas how to accomplish this?
Can i just add an obstacle on the obstacle topic? and if so how can i manage this?
Also i found out you can change the laserscan to add the new arbitrary obstacle here is this a possibility?
Thanks

Consider discussing this at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/ros-sig-navigation , the navigation SIG.

A:

If you are using Hydromedusa you could create a costmap2d layer that increases cost along the predicted path of the moving obstacle.

right now im using fuerte, is there a way to do it in fuerte? Thanks

For costmap2d layers you'll need Hydro. I assume there is a way to achieve it in Fuerte as well, but I'm afraid I have no idea how.

@Hendrik SeveQ Wiese  @KruseT instead of using a layered costmap is it possible to just "change" the obstacle topic to add new obstacles?

i would like to know how to use this to detect dynamic targets
