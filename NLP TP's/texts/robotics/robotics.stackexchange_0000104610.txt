Q:

Design Considerations Behind Creating controller_interface::ControllerInterfaceBase

What were the design considerations behind creating controller_interface::ControllerInterfaceBase in ROS2 Control? While it appears there are many controller_interface::ControllerInterface derived classes, I couldn't find any as far as my GitHub search shows.

A:

I think the rationale is mentioned here: both ControllerInterface and ChainableControllerInterface inherit from ControllerInterfaceBase, but controllers should not.
/**
 * Base interface class  for an controller. The interface may not be used to implement a controller.
 * The class provides definitions for `ControllerInterface` and `ChainableControllerInterface`
 * that should be implemented and extended for a specific controller.
 */
