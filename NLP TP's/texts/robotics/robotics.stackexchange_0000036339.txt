Please be clearer what link is broken.  The above link works fine for me. And so does the follow up link to electric installation instructions.

yes this link work fine , but svn download link in this page in broken , when i try to download svn link in this page that show this error : The requested URL /svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/sandbox/hark was not found on this server.

A:

Follow the link at the bottom for installation, under the Installation header.  You can file a ticket for them to update their manifest url which is rendered at the top.
