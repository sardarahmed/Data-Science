Q:

Problems sending two goals

Im using the simple_navigation_goal and i need to first send a goal to 7,2 (x,y) and then when he arrives he need to go to 10,4.  the problem is that i dont understand if the second goal i send must be 10,4 or 3,2.  Also when i give the robot a goal does this goal start from when the robot is, or does it represent a place in the map where it does not change when the robot moves?
I need to send my robot to a goal x,y and before he arrives i need him to go to 10,4 y have the /pose so i know where he is but dont know if the goal i must send is 10,4 or one related to the actual position posted by /pose
Any help would be really apprciated

A:

The goals for the navigation stack are in the global frame, which is usually the  /map frame. This means that you'll always send the absolute goal, in your case 7,2 followed by 10,4.
You can use the actionlib interface to the navigation stack to request navigation to the first goal, and get notified when the robot arrives there, so that you can send the next goal.
