Q:

Problems with compiling Beginner Tutorials [Solved]

Hi,
I am new to ROS and was trying to compile the Beginner Tutorials as explained in ROS tutorial website. I am getting the following error

+++ processing catkin package: 'beginner_tutorials'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(beginner_tutorials)
-- Using these message generators:  CMake Error at
/opt/ros/indigo/share/genmsg/cmake/genmsg-extras.cmake:268
(message):
Could not find
'share/std_msgs/cmake/std_msgs-msg-paths.cmake'
(searched in
'/home/titoro/catkin_ws/devel'). Call
Stack (most recent call first):
beginner_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt:70
(generate_messages)

I am at my wits end trying to figure out the problem. I will appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.
Edit 1:
I somehow messed up CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, I fixed it and now its working. Thanks for the help.
Regards,
TM

Do you have std_msgs installed? http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs

How did you fix your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH? (Ok delete build/devel and source /opt/ros/distro/setup.bash seemed to do it)

A:

Just FYI, you shouldn't be manually adjusting CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, you should be letting the setup.bash script located in the devel/ directory of your workspace manage your environment variables for you. Is your problem solved now?

Yeah I realized that later, as I was trying to link OpenCV with ROS I changed CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. Yeah my problem is solved.
