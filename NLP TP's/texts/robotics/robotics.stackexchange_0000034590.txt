A:

I'm not sure if the TurtleBot SDK will work on the Mac, but I have been working on ROS support for the Mac and you could follow my instructions here: https://github.com/wjwwood/ros-osx/tree/master/electric-lion-homebrew http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/OSX/Homebrew
Once you get the basics of ROS installed on your Mac you can give the TurtleBot SDK a whirl.
If you want to "drive" your turtlebot with your iPhone, Michael Carroll is working on an general OSC client for ROS which we have used in the past with the TouchOSC iPhone app to drive our robots.
