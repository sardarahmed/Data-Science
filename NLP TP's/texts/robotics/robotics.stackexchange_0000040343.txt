Q:

installing mongodb into my computer

Hi, friends
I have simple question about how to install mongodb into my computer.
I am working on laser_slam and I installed svn. When I run the code below,
$ roslaunch laser_slam laser_slam.launch
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [mongodb/wrapper.py]: Cannot locate installation of package mongodb: [rospack] couldn't find package [mongodb]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/electric/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/jkim/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks:/opt/ros/electric/stacks]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [laser_slam/laser_slam_node]: Cannot locate node of type [laser_slam_node] in package [laser_slam]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [laser_slam/cloud_snapshotter]: Cannot locate node of type [cloud_snapshotter] in package [laser_slam]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [laser_slam/scan_match_constraint_generator]: Cannot locate node of type [scan_match_constraint_generator] in package [laser_slam]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [laser_slam/scan_match_localizer]: Cannot locate node of type [scan_match_localizer] in package [laser_slam]
there was error, So I just started installing mongodb first.
If you know how to install mongodb, please teach me :)
Thank you

A:

You can install warehousewg  package. This provides monodb and a ros wrapper over it.
Other errors refer to missing packages. You can search in ros repository for each of them. After install them, laser_slam should not pose much of a problem.
