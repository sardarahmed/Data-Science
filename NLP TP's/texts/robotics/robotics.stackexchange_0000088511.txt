Q:

Problem with subscriber

HI,
I'm using a roboteq magsensor, and I want to read data from.  so I'm going to use Roboteq Linux API to interface one the sensor form a C++   ROS node through CANbus . The problem is I didn't come to know how to work: it's only one node that's gonna read from the sensor , how to use topic in this situation ?

A:

A node that reads sensor data is usually just a publisher, not a subscriber.
This node will use the Roboteq Linux API to read the sensor data, then it will publish that sensor data to the ROS network in a topic.
Then if you want to use that sensor data for something, you would write a separate node that subscribes to that topic.

Okey, a publisher node will read sensor data using Roboteq Linux API,
My problem is: I didn't come to know how to implement the API, especially when i don't know how the node will read data , because i don't know how to use the "topic" in this situation

Have you went through the beginner tutorials already? If not, I would suggest going through them before going any farther.
