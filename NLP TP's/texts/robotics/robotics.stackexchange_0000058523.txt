Q:

Unofficial msgs tutorial - rosjava

I'm going through the rosjava tutorials, and I'm running up against problems with making unofficial messages.
I followed all of the steps in section 2.1, but when I attempt to catkin_make, my build fails. I get the following:
.
(...)
:my_java_library:jar UP-TO-DATE
:foo_msgs:generateSources UP-TO-DATE
:foo_msgs:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:foo_msgs:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:foo_msgs:classes UP-TO-DATE
:foo_msgs:jar

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not copy MANIFEST.MF to '/home/team5/RSS-hydro/src/myjava_msgs/foo_msgs/build/tmp/jar/MANIFEST.MF'.
> A Jar can only accept a valid file or directory: /home/team5/RSS-hydro/src/myjava_msgs/foo_msgs/build/classes/main

I'm not sure what I need to do to fix this...have you seen it before? I've gotten through the Publisher/Listener tutorials, set up launch files, etc, so I thought that I was on the right track...but I have no clue where to run with this one.
Thanks!

A:

Just following up on here with what I posed to the rosjava sig group. I suspect this means you haven't created, or don't have the real foo_msgs package on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. If that's correct, I probably need to add this point more explicitly on the tutorial.
