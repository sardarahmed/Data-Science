Q:

State of the ECTO-based object recognition stack?

Hello,
I've been spending some time trying to figure out the puzzle, and I need some help: I'd love to try the ECTO-based framework for object recognition, but I've a hard time installing all the pieces.
I've tried on 2 boxes (one is Ubuntu 10.04, the other one is Ubuntu 12.04), on both electric and fuerte.
I understand these tools are new and everything is not stabilized yet. I summarize below my current experience. Hopefully it may help sorting out the documentation :-)
(for each step, I've referenced the link to the corresponding documentation)

On Ubuntu 10.04, electric:

I went for:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-electric-object-detection [1]
$ roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
$ rosrun object_recognition_core orb_template.py -o my_textured_plane [2]

=> ImportError: No module named ecto

-> no package ros-electric-ecto (how ros-electric-object-recognition can work, then?), so I went for a manual installation of ecto.
$ cd ~/ros-dev-electric
$ git clone git://github.com/plasmodic/ecto_kitchen.git
$ cd ecto_kitchen
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

[here, the doc on [3] forget a few steps that are mentionned in README.rst, in the ecto_kitchen repo]
$ git submodule foreach git checkout master
$ ln -s ./catkin/toplevel.cmake CMakeLists.txt
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make -j4

It takes some time, but eventually everything compile.
[3] mentions python_path.sh that does not exist anymore. I've sourced instead ~/ros-dev-electric/ecto_kitchen/setup.sh which allows to import ecto in python.
$ rosrun object_recognition_core orb_template.py -o my_textured_plane

=> from ecto_image_pipeline.io.source import create_source
=> ImportError: No module named io.source

Here, I'm stuck. I do not know to install ecto_image_pipeline. I've tried to clone it from https://github.com/wg-perception/ecto_image_pipeline.git to  ~/ros-dev-electric/ecto_kitchen, and then rebuild ecto_kitchen, but it fails at configuration (with a KeyError: 'ecto_image_pipeline').

On Ubuntu 10.04, fuerte:

No package for object recognition, but ecto is packaged:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ecto ros-fuerte-ecto-opencv ros-fuerte-ecto-pcl

Then, I've installed the recognition_kitchen [4]:
$ unset PYTHONPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
$ source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.sh
$ cd ~/ros-dev-fuerte
$ git clone git://github.com/wg-perception/recognition_kitchen.git
$ cd recognition_kitchen
$ rosinstall . /opt/ros/fuerte ./install/rosinstall_main ./install/rosinstall_pipelines ./install/rosinstall_ros

Which fails after cloning all repos with: rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install. After a while, I've figured out that I was still using rosinstall-0.5. I went a bit further with rosinstall-0.6:
$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

=> CMake fails with:
[...]
-- Generating .msg files for action object_recognition_msgs/ObjectRecognition /home/slemaign/ros-dev-fuerte/recognition_kitchen/object_recognition_msgs/action/ObjectRecognition.action
/opt/ros/fuerte/share/genmsg/cmake/pkg-genmsg.cmake.em:33: error: <type 'exceptions.IOError'>: 
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/slemaign/ros-dev-fuerte/recognition_kitchen/object_recognition_msgs//home/slemaign/ros-dev-fuerte/recognition_kitchen/object_recognition_msgs/srv/GetObjectInformation.srv'

For some reason, @ARG_SERVICES@ in /opt/ros/fuerte/share/genmsg/cmake/pkg-genmsg.context.in get configured in recognition_kitchen` with a duplicated path.
I've stopped here...

On Ubuntu 12.04:

Ubuntu 12.04 ships with its own libopencv 2.3 which conflicts with the one from WG (because, amongst other issues, WG links against libjpeg62 and Ubuntu's one uses libjpeg8). So I could not install much.

The four link of ubuntu 12.04 seems disappeared. Where are them? Thank you~

A:

I installed ECTO object recognition on Ubuntu 11.10 / ROS Electric and finally managed to get some of the tools working (template tracking and capturing preview). I did open my own question (it says: can this be done easier?), you might want to have a look: http://answers.ros.org/question/32015/running-ecto-object-recognition-on-ubuntu-1110-ros
