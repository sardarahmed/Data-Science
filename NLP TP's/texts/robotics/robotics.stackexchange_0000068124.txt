Q:

Weird characters in the log file

When I run roscore and redirect the logged output to a text file I can see weird characters:
 [ESC]]2;roscore[BEL]

where [ESC] and [BEL] are single characters within a small box (I could not add unicode to this question).
I suspect these codes come from colored ouput. How do I get rid of these characters?

A:

I could get rid of the first character with the following regulary expression (made for Python's re engine): '[^[:ascii:]].;'.
The second character could be removed by discarding all \a characters.
