Q:

turtlesim_node wont start on MAC OSX 10.6

Im trying to start with ROS, so im following the tutorials, my problem comes when I want to launch turtlesim_node by using the command rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node. It says:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named turtlesim_node below /Users/ME/ros/ros_tutorials/turtlesim
Then i try:
rosmake turtlesim and i got these errors:
"wxBitmap::wxBitmap(int, int, int)", referenced from:
turtlesim::TurtleFrame::TurtleFrame(wxWindow*)in turtle_frame.o
"_wxDefaultPosition", referenced from:
turtlesim::TurtleFrame::TurtleFrame(wxWindow*)in turtle_frame.o
ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[3]: *** [../bin/turtlesim_node] Error 1
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/turtlesim_node.dir/all] Error 2
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
any idea what could be wrong?
thanks in advance

A:

I just built the diamondback ros_tutorials stack from source on a OS X 10.6.7 machine, and had no trouble compiling, linking, or running turtlesim/turtlesim_node.  It works fine for me.  Looks like you have a problem with your wx installation.  Suggestions:

Make sure you have wx (and other supporting libraries) installed:

    rosmake --rosdep-install ros_tutorials

Reinstall wx:

    sudo port deactivate wxWidgets-python
    sudo port uninstall wxWidgets-python
    sudo port install wxWidgets-python
