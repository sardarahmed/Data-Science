Q:

Connecting android_tutorial_pubsub from Android device to PC

I can't seem to connect to the PC from an Android device running android_tutorial_pubsub.
I changed it so that android_tutorial_pubsub is not running it's own ROS master as per:
http://answers.ros.org/question/30726/does-android_tutorial_pubsub-connect-to-other-ros
I use ifconfig to get the IP on the Ubuntu VM (running on a Mac), but when I ping that address from adb shell, it says that it's unreachable.
Also, adb logcat tells me:
E/Registrar(21222): Exception caught while communicating with master.
I/DefaultPublisher(21222): Publisher registration failed: Publisher<PublisherDefinition<PublisherIdentifier<NodeSlaveIdentifier</android_gingerbread/ros_text_view, http://192.168.0.116:42837>, TopicIdentifier>, TopicDefinition<TopicIdentifier, MessageDefinition<rosgraph_msgs/Log, acffd30cd6b6de30f120938c17c593fb>>>>
Am I missing a step somewhere or using the wrong URI?
Edit: I've seen posts about setting ROS_IP and I tried that too (set in .bashrc).
Edit: The problem was with VMWare Fusion.  It was a networking setting.  In VMWare, select the wrench icon for the VM, then choose "Network Adaptor" and then "Connect Directly to the Physical Network (Bridged)".  Now I can ping and the publisher on the android device can send to the ros master on the VM.  Yay!
Thanks!
