Q:

Stereo camera calibration fundamental matrix

I'm writing a stereo camera driver, and am using the camera_calibrate package, with the command:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --approximate=0.1 --size 9x6 --square 0.025 right:=/stereocamera/right/image_raw left:=/stereocamera/left/image_raw left_camera:=/stereocamera/left right_camera:=/stereocamera/right

When storing the results to the camera this seems to trigger set_camera_info for the left and right cameras, but what about the mapping between the two cameras (the fundamental matrix calculation)?  Does camera_calibration do this, and if so what service call does it use?

A:

When using the camera_calibration package for stereo camera calibration the images of right and left camera are rectified and adjusted to become "ideal" stereo images. That means that corresponding points in left and right image have the same value in y (i.e. the epipoles are infinite, epipolar lines are parallel to the x-axis).
In this setting, no fundamental matrix but the baseline (distance from left to right camera center) is needed for 3D triangulation. This information is found in the CameraInfo message of the right camera. Please have a look at the CameraInfo message and at corresponding documentation.
