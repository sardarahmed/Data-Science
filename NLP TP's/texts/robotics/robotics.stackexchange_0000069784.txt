Q:

Rospack find problems

I am at the point that I may have to uninstall and reinstall ROS.  I had ROS working fine, but now I am having some problems.  When I try to run rospack find roscpp this is what I get:
leaf@leaf:~/catkin_ws$ rospack find cpp
[rospack] Warning: error while looking for /opt/ros/hydro/share/cmake_modules/CATKIN_IGNORE: boost::filesystem::status: Permission denied: "/opt/ros/hydro/share/cmake_modules/CATKIN_IGNORE"

[rospack] Error: stack/package cpp not found

But I get this when I :
leaf@leaf:~$ roscd roscpp
leaf@leaf:/opt/ros/hydro/share/roscpp$ 

My path looks ok :
leaf@leaf:~$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/leaf/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

Any help would be much appreciated.

[..] but now I am having some problems [..]

In addition to what @ahendrix asked, could you perhaps also think about what you changed (recently)? Did you install any additional packages? Did you do anything with cmake_modules you shouldn't have? Etc.

Also: you write you want to rospack find roscpp, but the error output you copy/pasted shows you ran rospack find cpp (note the missing ros prefix on cpp).

A:

It looks like the permission on /opt/ros/hydro/share/cmake_modules is wrong.
Try doing an ls -l on that directory and edit your question to include the results:
ls -l /opt/ros/hydro/share/cmake_modules

That was the problem.  Some reason cmake_modules folder was gone on this machine, so I copied and pasted cmake_modules folder from another machine. But I didn't change permission to allow use of folders with the properties.  After correcting permission everything seems to work fine.  Thank you!

You should never directly modify the contents of /opt/ros; if cmake_modules was missing, you should have reinstalled it through the package manager. You probably still should. On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-hydro-cmake-modules
