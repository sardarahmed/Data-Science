Q:

Installation of packages on Fedora has change from YUM -> DNF

I have an update to the installation of ROS on Fedora 4.0.4-301.fc22.x86_64: the command for yum has changed to dnf.
Here is the correct command for the installation:
sudo dnf install collada-dom-devel python-matplotlib pcre-devel PyQwt-devel gtk2-devel tinyxml-devel PyQt4 yaml-cpp-devel python-nose pcl-devel opencv-devel ogre-devel libuuid-devel console-bridge-devel sbcl tango-icon-theme fltk-fluid cppunit-devel python-empy bzip2-devel pcl-tools python-devel mesa-libGL-devel urdfdom-devel apr-devel vtk-java pcl wxPython-devel qhull-devel numpy cmake urdfdom-headers-devel python-mock boost-devel PyOpenGL log4cxx-devel PyQt4-devel graphviz-python libtool-ltdl-devel libtheora-devel assimp libtool hddtemp vtk-python gtest-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel graphviz fltk-devel poco-devel gazebo-devel eigen3-devel python-psutil pydot mesa-libGLU-devel libcurl-devel lz4-devel libogg-devel python-pillow-qt python-netifaces opencv-python sip-devel qt-devel assimp-devel

I have the ability to update all the scripts and insert the correct build commands, can we initiate this in GIT?

I've reformatted your question a bit, as it was completely unreadable before. Please use the formatting tools in the toolbar in the future.
