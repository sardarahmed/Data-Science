Q:

usb_cam installation on ubuntu and default launch file

Hello All,
I installed ros-jade-usb-cam with apt-get and then made a "sudo dpkg -L ros-jade-usb-cam" which generated the following files:
/opt
/opt/ros
/opt/ros/jade
/opt/ros/jade/include
/opt/ros/jade/include/usb_cam
/opt/ros/jade/include/usb_cam/usb_cam.h
/opt/ros/jade/lib
/opt/ros/jade/lib/libusb_cam.so
/opt/ros/jade/lib/usb_cam
/opt/ros/jade/lib/usb_cam/usb_cam_node
/opt/ros/jade/lib/pkgconfig
/opt/ros/jade/lib/pkgconfig/usb_cam.pc
/opt/ros/jade/share
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam/cmake
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam/cmake/usb_camConfig.cmake
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam/cmake/usb_camConfig-version.cmake
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam/launch
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam/launch/usb_cam-test.launch
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam/package.xml
/usr
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/ros-jade-usb-cam
/usr/share/doc/ros-jade-usb-cam/changelog.Debian.gz
and then I launch
rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node
and the image launches.
Where is the default .launch file, I created a usb_cam.launch file under ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib and I can launch roslaunch usb_cam.launch and it will work. (however when only I am in ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib directory.
I previously installed usb_cam on this computer from source, and everything was working fine - so the real question is:
when we install usb_cam tru ubuntu package system, where do we put the usb_cam.launch file?
Best regards,
C.

A:

It would be ugly but you could drop another launch file alongside this one:
/opt/ros/jade/share/usb_cam/launch/usb_cam-test.launch

And then roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam.launch.
https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg/usb_cam/blob/develop/launch/usb_cam-test.launch
But really you should have a catkin package that contains your custom usb_cam.launch like catkin_ws/src/my_package/launch/usb_cam.launch, and then make sure to fill in the CMake commands to get it get installed if you are sourcing catkin_ws/install/setup.bash instead of devel/setup.bash, and then roslaunch my_package usb_cam.launch should work.

Hey Lukasw
I tried a similar command in order to achieve this result.
 source /opt/ros/kinetic/share/usb_cam/launch/usb_cam-test.launch

However, error message
 bash: /opt/ros/kinetic/share/usb_cam/launch/usb_cam-test.launch: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token 'newLine

I apologize if it is a silly doubt. I am a newbie in ROS.
ROS- Kinetic, Ubuntu 16.04.
Thanks in advance

You can't source a launch file, use roslaunch instead.
Comment by aaditya_saraiya on 2017-08-25:
Thank you so much, that works perfectly.
Just one more question. If I need to change the default camera to be an external USB camera and not my integrated webcam. what changes do I need to make?
<param name="video_device" value="/dev/video1" />

I changed the launch file this way, doesnt work.
Comment by aaditya_saraiya on 2017-08-25:
edit. It works as per this
link text
However then I need to cd into the launch directory and then run roslaunch. It doesn't work if I run the command you mentioned. Any idea what could be the reason.
Thanks in advance
