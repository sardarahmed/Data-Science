Q:

Rosbag record to different path?

Hi all,
Is there any way to record rosbag data to a different location than the default location?
I am getting the following error:
[ERROR] [1460470166.869390414]: Less than 1GB of space free on disk with corridorlocalization_2016-04-12-16-00-06.bag.active.  Disabling recording.
[ WARN] [1460470167.370142337]: Not logging message because logging disabled.  Most likely cause is a full disk.

Is it possible to record rosbag data to a pen drive?
Thanks

A:

The rosbag wiki has the information. Assuming your pen drive is at /mnt/pen you can use either the -o or -O flag:
rosbag record -o /mnt/pen/ /chatter
rosbag record -O /mnt/pen/test.bag /chatter

The first case with lower-case -o will output a bag file with the timestamp at the location you specify. The second case with upper-case -O will output a bag file simply named test.bag at the location you specify (without the timestamp on the filename).
