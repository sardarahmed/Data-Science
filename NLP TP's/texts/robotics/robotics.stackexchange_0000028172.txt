Q:

Spawn SDF and control joints

I have an SDF file of a robot, and would like to be able to control it's joints in the same way as shown in the tutorial here.
The reason why I need this is that I need gearbox joints in my model, like in the example here, but they cannot be parsed in URDF. On the other hand, I also need to able to control joint torques, which seems like it cannot work in SDF.

A:

So while digging through the source code, I found that the robotParam is parsed for the transmissions. That is also mentioned in the tutorial above, but somehow I missed it. So the solution is to provide the URDF location to the robotParam of controller plugin and the transmissions will be parsed from the URDF.
