Q:

Doubt regarding collision map

Hi,
i have a few doubts regarding the collision map -

is it possible to use our own cloud data as a collision map?
is there a possibility to identify clusters/cloud within the collision map as objects so that my arm does not consider those as collisions and can go near it..

i know these features should be present i am still looking for them, till then if any1 of you has any idea do let me know.
Thank you :)

A:

Yes

You will have to do the work yourself such as clustering deciding what is to be avoided etc. And then publish on a separate topic to populate the collision map.
