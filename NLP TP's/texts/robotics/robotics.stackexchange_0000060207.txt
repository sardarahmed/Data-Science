Q:

rosrun robopluscom robopluscom

Hi , what do I need to install to make the following command : "rosrun robopluscom robopluscom" work? It shows command not found error in my ros Groovy.
Thanks in advance.
[edit] The full context of error is : [rospack] Error: stack/package robopluscom not found

A:

You should always post the full text of an error -- as it is printed. "command not found" probably means rosrun was not found? I don't know for sure since you haven't posted the exact error message. If rosrun was not found, you probably don't have it on your path -- have you sourced /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash?
If instead rosrun is telling you that "robopluscom" is not found -- well, is it installed? Is it built? Is it on your path?

I do apologise. The full error is : [rospack] Error: stack/package robopluscom not found

how have you installed robopluscom (I'm not at all familiar with the package -- I've never heard of it)
