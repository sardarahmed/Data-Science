Q:

Anybody planning to integrate NVIDIA's Isaac SDK with ROS?

Sorry if this isn't really answers.ros.org is for. Just curious if anybody is planning to implement this. I've had some experience implementing a Keras RL network with a ROS/MAVROS node but I wonder if Isaac might enable tighter integration with ROS.

A:

In 2020 IINM, NVIDIA officially made ROS bridge for Isaac SDK.
I have yet used it so I can't tell anything. I couldn't find their release policy though, so far their release cycle doesn't seem rapid (release once or twice a year?). As of 2021/03/02 the latest version is still 2020.02 and runs on Ubuntu 18.04 (I'm not necessarily saying no frequent release is bad. It's just something to keep in mind).

I've marked this as the answer (by accepting it), as this seems like it is the answer.
"Anybody" seems to be NVIDIA here, which, seeing as Isaac is NVIDIA's product, would be the ideal person/entity to provide that ROS wrapper.
