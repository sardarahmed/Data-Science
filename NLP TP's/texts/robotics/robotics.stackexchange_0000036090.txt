Q:

Potential Field navigation implementation in ROS?

At Player/Stage, I often used VFH, a potential field navigation means. However, I have not really come across any potential field driver implementation at ROS. Has anyone attempted to do so ? Can VFH be ported in to ROS ?

A:

A very simple implementation of potential fields is available here. You can use it for inspiration. AFAIK there is no VFH implemented in ROS (people seem to prefer the dynamic window approach), but it shouldn't be hard to port the Player implementation in ROS. A Player wrapper is provided in the same repository.
