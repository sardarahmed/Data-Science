Q:

TF tutorial crash

I'm following this tutorial
http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf
The last step in the launch file
  <node name="turtle_pointer" pkg="turtle_tf" type="turtle_tf_listener.py" respawn="false" output="screen" >
  </node>

systematically fails:
[turtle_pointer-6] process has died [pid 4833, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/geometry_tutorials/turtle_tf/nodes/turtle_tf_listener.py __name:=turtle_pointer __log:=/home/erupter/.ros/log/a1d3b986-354a-11e2-9db2-d49a205b33a5/turtle_pointer-6.log].
log file: /home/erupter/.ros/log/a1d3b986-354a-11e2-9db2-d49a205b33a5/turtle_pointer-6*.log

here is the log content

So I edited in the launch file the last node and removed the .py from turtle_tf_listener.py
This way it doesn't crash anymore but I have these
[ INFO] [1353660856.840262559]: waitForService: Service [/spawn] has not been advertised, waiting...
[ INFO] [1353660856.928373839]: waitForService: Service [/spawn] is now available.
[ERROR] [1353660857.031546679]: Frame id /turtle2 does not exist! Frames (1): 

and I can't get past this.
Also why when I use a launch file my master is not accessible from other terminals as it always is?
Meaning that when I launch this launch file, open another terminal for example to use rxgraph, this can't find the master although it's at the usual URI
http://localhost:11311

A:

There looks to be a regression in waitForTransform: https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/102 please help track this down on the ticket.
