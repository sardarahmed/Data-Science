A:

Those are documented here, I'll copy pasta though:

lower (optional, defaults to 0) - An
attribute specifying the lower joint
limit (radians for revolute joints,
meters for prismatic joints). Omit if
joint is continuous.
upper (optional, defaults to 0) - An
attribute specifying the upper joint
limit (radians for revolute joints,
meters for prismatic joints). Omit if
joint is continuous.
effort (required) - An attribute for
enforcing the maximum joint effort
(|applied effort| < |effort|). See
safety limits.
velocity (required) - An attribute for
enforcing the maximum joint velocity.
See safety limits.

Effort is between 0 and 100 (units are %) and velocity is radians per second for revolute and continuous joints and meters per second for linear or prismatic joints.

I'm not sure this is correct: fi velocity is in rad/s for all revolute and continuous joints, while it's m/s for linear type joints.

You're right, I corrected it. Thanks.

Effort is between 0 and 100 (units are %)

I'm not sure if the effort unit is correct either. Isn't it in N? And I'm pretty sure it's not limited to 100.

"The effort limit is an attribute of the limit tag. In this case, a controller cannot command an effort of more than 30 N (N-m for revolute) nor less than -30 N (N-m for revolute) on the joint."
