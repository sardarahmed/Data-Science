Q:

Get RGB image of Segmented Objects?

Hi,
is there any way to get rgb image of segmented objects in tabletop_object_detector node?
(Actually i want to send the rgb image of segmented objects to a 2d object recognition node which is using sift library!)

A:

Yep, just requires a few steps.

Choose which camera you want to use (on a PR2, narrow_stereo might be a good choice). I'll refer to this as camera.
Create a [image_geometry](http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_geometry).PinholeCameraModel using camera/camera_info.
Let's say you have a PointStamped called object_center which represents the center of mass of some detected object. Transform that point into camera's frame using a tf.TransformListener.
Project that point onto camera's image plane using your camera model's project3dToPixel.
