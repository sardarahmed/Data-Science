Q:

BeagleBone Black & Kinect

Hi Everybody,
Does anybody know how complex of a process it is to get a Ubuntu, Kinect and ROS running on a BeagleBone Black? I would like to do this for my humanoid robot project.
Thanks.

A:

Don't bother. The BeagleBone Black doesn't have enough processing power to handle a Kinect.
Some of the newer, more powerful ARM boards such as the Odroid U3 can handle a Kinect or an ASUS Xtion fairly well.
