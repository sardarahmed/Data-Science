Q:

How do you completely uninstall old versions of gazebo?

Hi, I am new to gazebo, and I am trying to install gazebo through Homebrew on Mac OSX 10.8.5.  I had an error when I installed gazebo 1.9.5, so rather than try to fix this error (which I think was just a missing program), I installed gazebo --HEAD, which I think should have given me gazebo 3.0.  I compiled gazebo using catkin as instructed, but now this happens:

It appears as if gazebo is still 1.9.5.  Sometimes I am able to connect to master, but most of the time I am not.  How do I get rid of the older versions of gazebo?  Or is there another problem that I should fix?
Homebrew doctor gives no warnings or errors.
Thank you for your help!

Can you post the output of the following commands: brew info sdformat, brew info gazebo, which gazebo? This will help with debugging. Thanks.

A:

Gazebo requires an internet connection in order to download model files (such as the sun and ground plane for the default world). If you don't internet access the first time you run gazebo, it will give this error. One option is to manually download model files from gazebosim.org/models and put them in your ~/.gazebo/models folder. Another option is to clone to the https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models repository and place its location in the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH environment variable. Let me know if this works for you.

Ok, thanks for your help!  It seems to be working now. I have the models in the folder by cloning them.  It must have been a combination of internet error on the first run and some other problem that must have resolved itself after rebuilding.
