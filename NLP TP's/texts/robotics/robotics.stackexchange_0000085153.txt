Q:

ROS networking unable to see mesages published by slave computer

I am running Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic on both a Beaglebone black(Master) and intel NUC(Slave). My problem is connecting the NUC to the ros master on the beaglebone over wifi. I set the ip address of the BBB as 10.0.0.30 and IP address of the NUC as 10.0.0.35. I am able to launch a publishing node on the BBB and echo those /turtle1/cmd_vel messages on the slave but not the other way around. Below are the shell scripts that run on boot on both machines and output of roswtf on each machine when the publisher is running on the nuc(slave) and I am attempting to see the data on the BBB.
BBB(master):
 #! /bin/bash
cd $(dirname $(readlink -f $0))
. devel/setup.bash
ulimit -c unlimited
export ROS_IP=10.0.0.30
until ping -c1 $ROS_IP &>/dev/null; do :; done
roslaunch robot2017 main.launch
#roslaunch robot2017 turtle_pub.launch

roswtf on BBB(Master)

NUC seems to have the same startup script as master, is that a typo?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-02-06:
Can you please clarify why this is not a duplicate of #q281760 and #q281434? If it is a duplicate: please close / delete this one, pick one of the others and update that.
Please don't post duplicates of your question unnecessarily.
#q281760 even has some comments already.

A:

Turns out it was a firewall issue that turned on after an update.
