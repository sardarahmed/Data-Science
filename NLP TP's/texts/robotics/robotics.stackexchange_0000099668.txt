Q:

How to assign xacro arguments to xacro macro parameters?

I am initialising a macro in my xacro file as
<xacro:macro name="sensor_d435" params="name:=realsense_d435_camera topics_ns:=realsense_d435 parent *origin">.
I have a xacro argument with the name robot_namespace in my launch file. I want to assign it to the topics_ns while initializing my macro, something like: topics_ns:=$(arg robot_namespace). When I do this and launch my original launch file, I get an error saying invalid expression: $(arg
Probably, it is seeing $(arg and robot_namespace) as 2 different and separate parameters.
Any way how I can achieve what I want?
TIA

A:

I raised an issue regarding this on xacro's GitHub and a kind developer created a PR for this feature request. It has now been merged. I hope now it will be possible to assign argument names to macro parameters.
Thank you, community!
