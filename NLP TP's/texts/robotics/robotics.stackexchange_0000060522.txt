Q:

Error running rviz "undefined symbol error: /opt/ros/hydro/lib/librviz.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7package10getPluginsERKSsS2_RSt6vectorISsSaISsEEb"

This is different from the solutions and questions that are already asked. I even tried to fix this with the already existing solutions although there differed by the "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/librviz.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3ros7package10getPluginsERKSsS2_RSt6vectorISsSaISsEEb" part of the error message.
The whole cmd line says:
developer@haf:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun rviz rviz
[ INFO] [1404305441.695792813]: rviz version 1.10.16
[ INFO] [1404305441.695862492]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.4 (Cthugha)

A:

I saw something similar recently. Try upgrading your installed versions of roslib and rviz to the latest versions:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rviz ros-hydro-roslib

Also, doing a dist-upgrade helps most often.
