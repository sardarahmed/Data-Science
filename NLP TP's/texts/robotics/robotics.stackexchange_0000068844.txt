Q:

catkin_make causes hard shutdown

Hi all,
I have encountered a very strange problem and can't seem to find any other instance of the problem. I have a catkin workspace that I tried to perform catkin_make on. For some reason, when I execute catkin_make, it runs for a while and then my computer blacks out completely. I believe that is a hard shutdown of the computer.
So, I have no idea why executing catkin_make should cause a hard shutdown and was wondering if anyone had any ideas as to why that would be happening. I don't believe my CPU is overheating and I have done a SMART self-test and it comes back ok.
Thanks!

A:

Turns out the solution was what gvdhoorn recommended; Running

catkin_make -j1

seems to fix the problem. Still don't really know the root cause but it does suggest that overheating might have been occurring. Thanks for the help! Really appreciate it!

That is not really a solution, but more of a work-around. Does your computer ever show these symptoms if you run other CPU/GPU intensive applications? Do you have a swap partition setup? CPU temp is easily monitored: SensorInstallHowto.
