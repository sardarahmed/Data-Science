Q:

Passing arg between launches

Hi,
I have a master .launch file that runs another .launch.
My problem is when i do the example of the (http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/arg), i get an error message included file [/home/user/catkin_ws/src/] requires the 'test' arg to be set.
<launch>
<group if="$(arg cam)">
    <include file="$(find openni_launch)/launch/openni.launch">
             <arg name="Kinect" value="1.5" />
    </include>
</group>
</launch>

And on the other file i have:
<launch>
<arg name="Kinect"/>
....
<param name="Test" value="$(arg Kinect)"/>
</launch>

Anyone can help me?
Thanks

A:

I don't see anything in the sample you posted that would cause the error you describe.
That error usually indicates that your included launch file has an <arg> tag without a default value, and you aren't providing a value for that argument. I would check your included launch file for a line like: <arg name="test">.
If you can't find this on your own, please post a complete sample that reproduces the issue; maybe by removing the other parts of the launch file and checking that it still produces the same error.
