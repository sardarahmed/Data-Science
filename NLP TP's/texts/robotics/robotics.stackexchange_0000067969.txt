Q:

Arduino rosserial - Unable to sync with device

Hi,
I have been using the rosserial_arduino in order to run a ROS node on arduino.
I have the following error:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1433855869.447165] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

But, If I use the Arduino IDE before run the node it works fine.
[INFO] [WallTime: 1433858173.848825] Note: publish buffer size is 512 bytes
[INFO] [WallTime: 1433858173.849108] Setup publisher on /joystick_raw [lhd_msgs/Joystick]
[INFO] [WallTime: 1433858173.855225] Note: subscribe buffer size is 512 bytes
[INFO] [WallTime: 1433858173.855483] Setup subscriber on /leds_ocu [lhd_msgs/Leds]

If I disconnect the arduino, and I connect it again doesn't work again.
Is not a problem with the permissions of the USB.
Thanks
Can you help me out?

do you have hydro installed and did you compile the libraries with groovy?!?!

A:

I encountered the same problem, mine was due to the buffer being over filled ( see q/a ). Try increasing the buffer size or reducing the message size. Im not sure of the contents of you messages but that was my issue.
Also try a diferent USB cable, I also encountered faulty cables giving this issue.

I had the same issue and the errors looked like a memory problem: I could run each half of my code separately, but when I put the halves together I got that error. Also, I tried to comment out code to identify the "problematic section," but kept identifying different lines that caused the error. In the end I was able to work around this by reducing the number of publishers and the message size in each one.
