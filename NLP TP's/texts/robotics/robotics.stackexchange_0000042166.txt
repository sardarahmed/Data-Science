Q:

How to remove the shade of markers in rviz?

Hello everyone. I am visualizing about 100000 marker points in rviz. Due to the shade (or shadow) of markers and small size of points, the color of points is not clearly visible. Is there any way to remove the shade of marker points?

What do you mean by "shade"?
Comment by Ali Abdul Khaliq on 2012-07-10:
Maybe its batter to call it shadow of markers (cubes or points).

Do you mean the alpha channel (transparency)?
Comment by Ali Abdul Khaliq on 2012-07-10:
No its not the alpha channel. I have added the following screen short where the shadow of points are creating magnetic field like pattern. I want to remove this pattern.

A:

Try zooming in or out. Those look like aliasing issues (likely due to the small size of your markers).
For a more detailed explanation, take a look at the description of the Moir√© pattern
