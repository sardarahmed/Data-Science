Q:

navigation stack build errors

I am trying to build the navigation stack from ros-planning/navigation/tree/indigo-devel but am having problems with libraries:
ros/catkin_ws/src/navigation/map_server/src/image_loader.cpp:43:27: fatal error: SDL/SDL_image.h: No such file or directory
 #include <SDL/SDL_image.h>

Solved that with apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev
But I cannot get past this one:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lorocos-bfl

It comes up while trying to compile the robot_pose_ekf package.  Removing that package allows the entire nav stack to build.  The same problem is referenced here
but the answer is to build robot_pose_ekf separately.  There should be a better way, so that the entire nav stack builds with catkin_make.
Suggestions?

Have you run rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src before trying to build? That should resolve any missing dependency issues (and would've told you about sdl-image missing).

A:

TRY THIS.
 sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-bfl
