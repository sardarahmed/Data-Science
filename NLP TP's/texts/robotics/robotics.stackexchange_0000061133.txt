Q:

Strange error when installing gazebo

I'm using groovy, and I followed this tutorial in order to install gazebo http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/Installing_gazebo_ros_Packages
So I when I made rosdep check --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy
it said

A:

Try
rosdep check --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy

or executing the command you have stated in the src directory, not workspace root.
