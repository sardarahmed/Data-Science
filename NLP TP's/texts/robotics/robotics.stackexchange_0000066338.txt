Q:

Where to configure the detecting range of urg_node?

Hi, guys,
I am using hokuyo UTM-30LX EW laser. I can set the parameters in my launch files, such as "ip_address", "angle_min", "angle_max" and so on, shown in link text. But how to set the detecting range in launch file or someother place? Thanks.

I'm not familiar with a detection range setting for the Hokuyo. Can you provide a link to the manufacturer's documentation or an excerpt describing the parameter you want to set?

@ahendrix The laser I used is Hokuyo UTM-30LX EW. I hope to set the minimum and maximum detecting range. I don't know how to set them for urg_node.

A:

You could use the LaserScanRangeFilter of the laser_filters package.
