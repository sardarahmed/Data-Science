Q:

Source Install Fails with "No package vtk-phython available"

I am trying to do a source install of Jade onto Fedora 22, using the instructions here. I am trying the desktop-full install. Everything works until I try to resolve the dependencies with the command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y

I then get an error that No package vtk-pHython available. I assume this should be vtk-python? if so, who should I report the error to? The full console output is below.
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y

A:

I agree that this definitely looks like a typo. The mistake can be seen here. The rosdistro package is where you would want to submit a bug report.
Assuming that the vtk-python package will actually provide the necessary libs/headers/modules/etc. needed for the python-vtk dependency (it probably will), you could continue with your install by commenting out this dependency in any of the package.xml files in your ~/ros_catkin_ws/src/ directory.
