Q:

rosbag meta data

Is there a way to extend the bag file format with a description field that explains how the data was achieved/recorded. Or at least a link to a document that gives this details.
I was thinking of something like:
rosbag record /tf -m "this was recorded for IROS paper 2011 with <settings> active and female test person, more info in bag_specs.txt"

Or even a:
--detail-file="_bag_specs.txt"

Perhaps there is such a functionality that I'm not aware of? (and no I don't want to be putting this into a topic which is also recorded)

A:

How do I go further in implementing such functionality? Is there interest from WG to give support? Do I file a ticket?

Please open a ticket and we can discuss the feature there.  Thanks.

This would indeed be my next question, how should we implement this?
Comment by Tim Field on 2011-03-16:
A ticket would be good; a patch better.  We've held off on implementing this as there's room for abusing the feature, but it's been demanded enough and is useful in enough circumstances that I think we should pull the trigger.  I like your -m option.
