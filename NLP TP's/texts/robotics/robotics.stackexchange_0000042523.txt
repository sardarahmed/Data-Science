Q:

multiple clientservice in rosserial?

I need multiple service clients on an arduino running rosserial.
In setup() I have:
nh.serviceClient(client1);
nh.serviceClient(client2);
Only the first is connecting. If I swap the order then client2 is the only one called. No error messages in either serial_node.py or by the Arduino.
Anyone get multiple service clients to work?

Didn't realize I needed to have the ServiceServer running. Without it running it got hung on the first serviceClient and wouldn't continue to the second one.
