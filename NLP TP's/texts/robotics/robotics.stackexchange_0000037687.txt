Q:

set priority on python node

How I can change the priority of a node written y python?
Im working with the kinect and a haptic device to be used in the chest of a person, after I get the information about the distance of the object and some processing I want to send it through the serial port to the haptic devic, I realized that I have some delays, so I want to change the priority of xecution of the node or some portion of the node ( written in python) in order to get a behavior close to real time.

So you want one node to run before another?

Could you explain what you mean by "priority" and what you're trying to accomplish?

A:

You could use the launch-prefix flag in a .launch file, with a value something like "nice -n -1" (nice being the UNIX command for setting priority).
However, this feels very much like an XY Problem to me; can you edit the question to explain in more detail what you're trying to do? Using nice is a hack; there's probably a better answer.
