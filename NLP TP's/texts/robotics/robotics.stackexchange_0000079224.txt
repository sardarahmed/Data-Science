Q:

MoveIt! Adding Collision Objects

Hey guys,
im trying to add some simple collision objects in Python to my planning scene in RViz to plan some trajectories with my UR5 Robot.
I tried something like
scene = moveit_commander.PlanningSceneInterface()
p.pose.position.x = 0.4
p.pose.position.y = -0.2
p.pose.position.z = 0.3
scene.add_box("table", p, (0.5, 1.5, 0.6))

but this didnt work. Unfortunately the MoveIt! Tutorial is missing this part for Python (only got it for C++). Can anyone help please?
Im running ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.

p.pose.orientation.w is probably initialised to 0. That is not a valid quaternion. Try setting w to 1 and see if that changes anything.

Did you see this related question: #q209030 ? If that doesn't solve your problem: is this the complete code or just a small part? Also, did you see an error message of some sort?

I was missing some parts of the code. Just look at the answer on the linked question, there is the completed code and it worked for me.
