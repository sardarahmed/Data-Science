Q:

opencv2/opencv.hpp missing on vc2008 Express

Hi,
I'm trying to run the program ssimTest found at this URL:
http://nma.web.nitech.ac.jp/fukushima/opencv/ssim/ssim-e.html
I have the same environment, OpenCV2.1 and VC2008 Express.
When I compile, I see this:
c:\users\asus24\documents\visual studio 2008\projects\ssimtest\ssimtest\main.cpp(2) : fatal error C1083: Impossible open the include file 'opencv2/opencv.hpp': No such file or directory
And this file does not exist.
Some friends of other list have suggested to me to ask here.
Also I have see the www.ros.org pages and the Win download seems to be compiled
with MinGW and CMake. As I have VC2008 Express now I'm in confusion and totally lost.
Ciao
Leo

A:

You need to use a more recent version of OpenCV that has C++ bindings and the file you are mentioning. 2.3.1 got released in July 2011.
That will solve your issue but you can also file bug reports for OpenCV on:
