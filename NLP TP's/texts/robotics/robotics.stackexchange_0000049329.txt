Q:

Preferred ROS XML parser/generator

I would like to create a node/library that both reads in xml and writes xml with a well defined format (sort of like URDF).  I know there are tons of libraries for doing this, but I want to know what are the preferred libraries to use with ROS in either C++ or Python?

A:

Here are some quick examples I found:

TinyXML for C++ (in urdf_parser.h and srdf)
minidom for python (in roslaunch and urdf_parser_py)
BeautifulSoup for python (in ur5_driver)
