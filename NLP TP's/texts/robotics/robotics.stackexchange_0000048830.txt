Q:

Calling a python script with ROSRUN

Hello,
I have seen that you can call python scripts with rosrun, i.e.:

rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py

and I have been trying to setup my project so that I can call a python script in the same way:

rosrun myproject mypythonscript.py

following the structure of the tf2_tools project, I have created a folder named scripts in the myproject, but I can not yet call that script using rosrun.
What else do I have to do?
Thanks in advance!

A:

First, make sure the python script is executable (chmod +x mypythonscript.py).
Next, make sure you have a shebang line at the top of the script that looks like #!/usr/bin/env python.

It works now, thank you! I did not had a blank at the shebang line >.<

For me, it was a problem of file format (between unix and dos format). Explainations here
I ran the command : 'dod2unix mypythonscript.py' and the rosrun command did work then.
