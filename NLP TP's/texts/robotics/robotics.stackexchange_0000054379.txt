Q:

kinect green light keeps freshing. Seems no driver

I have installed freenect from
                sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-freenect-stack

and also blacklist gspca_kinect(I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)
But when I try the command
                roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch

It says that
                [ INFO] [1380174487.842752473]: No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected

and then I try
lsusb
it shows me like
               Bus 002 Device 015: ID 045e:02c2 Microsoft Corp. 
               Bus 002 Device 016: ID 045e:02be Microsoft Corp. 
               Bus 002 Device 017: ID 045e:02bf Microsoft Corp. 

These are kinect's and I could not find something like camera or others.
Could you please help me? Since for this Sept I could not even run kinect on Ubuntu
and I feel confused.
Thank you so much and I will wait for the reply.

Does it work using openni_launch? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with Hydro and not having any issues with my Kinects.

Do you mean that you can launch Kinect successfully? What is your version of Kinect?
Could you plz leave your email and we could discuss directly.

@brianaxelrod please post your comment as an answer in order to be able to mark this question properly as closed. Thx.

A:

It turns out that it was the specific kinect. Changing the kinect seemed to fix it. I'll have another chance to use it on Tuesday or Thursday so I can grab some more information and test it. @Battery, how would i grab the version? feel free to email me at kinect-problems@mit.edu in the next 48hours.

Did you still use a Kinect for Windows or chaged for a Kinect for XBOX? I'm having the exact same problem with a Kinect for Windows 1517.
