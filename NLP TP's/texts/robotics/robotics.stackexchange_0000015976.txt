Q:

Which motors are specifically used for UR3 (Universal robot arm)

I am looking for the specification of UR3, peak torque and rpm.

A:

The technical specs sheet publicly provided by Universal Robots doesn't list the RPM or peak torque. When this is the case, I find it beneficial to simply call the manufacturer/developer for more technical information. Fortunately, at the bottom of the technical specs sheet, a phone number is provided.
