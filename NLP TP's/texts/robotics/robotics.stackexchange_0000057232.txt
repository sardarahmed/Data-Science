Q:

ros::init API Documentation

I am having trouble finding the ros::init call in the documentation. I've followed a few of the tutorial links and tried searching through the documentation. Here are my main leads:
http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/roscpp/html/index.html
http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Initialization%20and%20Shutdown -- The links here 404
Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

I looked through the header and saw that my second link pretty much describes all of the init functionality. So I guess my question is just related to navigating the doxygen documentation ... am I doing it wrong or is ros::init really not in there?

A:

Short answer: http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/roscpp/html/init_8h.html
But I don't know why it doesn't appear in the API doc under the same url as before. It seems like doxygen is not correctly referencing any symbols in the ros namespace.

Perfect! I like all functions laid out. I didn't think to check each header individually. I was hoping it would be under the namespace section or functions sections but nope. Thank you!
