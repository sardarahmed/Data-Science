Q:

Most appropriated simulator?

What software package would you suggest to simulate a team of UAVs in USAR scenarios?
Required features:

3D
realistic outdoor environments
multiagent
simulation of the appropriate sensors (IMU, GPS, cameras, ...)
ROS integration

We will use some AscTec firefly but any simulated quadrotor would be fine.
I tried USARSim which has all the required features but lacks the integration with ROS. There's an open source (wannabe) bridge project USARSimRos that should do the job but has some bugs (e.g. here). Nothing unresolvable but before reinventing the wheel I am scouting for alternative solutions.

A:

I think that Gazebo should cover these features as well.
Have you looked at what others have done with the hector_quadrotor package?

Thank you tringhost, in fact I am about to try the tutorials, as soon as the gazebo installation is done... :-)
One concern: do you know of any ready-made outdoor scenarios available?

I made the simple outdoor scenario that is used in the outdoor demo, but creating your own is pretty easy if you add the the required Gazebo models (or just drag and drop some of the existing ones into your simulated world).
