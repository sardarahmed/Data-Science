Q:

turtlebot kinect mounting

Hi!
I was wondering how the kinect is mounted on turtlebot as I'm trying to mount one on our Pioneer robot sporting a pan tilt unit. So I thought I could ask a quick question about that.
I can see that perhaps you drilled some holes on Kinect and used just the right screw to squeeze it in (if not how to fasten from the other part?) Or used the existing holes under air vents for the bottom part?
If you have a parts list and some quick instructions for mounting that would be most helpful.

A:

If you pull off the little vent covers on the bottom (they are just a stick on, flexible plastic), you'll expose a total of 4 screws. These screws do require a security Torx driver to remove, but once out, you can thread a standoff into them.
I believe this is what the turtlebot is using. I am using these mount holes on my robot Maxwell.
