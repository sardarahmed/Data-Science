Q:

TCP vs Plugin interface. What is better?

According to official documentation there are two ways for an interaction with a robot in simulation: TCP and Plugin interface.
What is better? Could you write pros and cons of each.
And what will be easier to integrate with real robot?

A:

The two ways of interaction are very different, and are designed to facilitate different use cases.
A plugin has direct access to the Gazebo internals through the C++ api. A plugin also runs in the same process as Gazebo.
Message passing does not have direct access to the C++ api, but it does allow you to run code in a separate process (or on a different machine) from Gazebo.
