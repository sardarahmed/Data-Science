Q:

MacOSX 10.7 ROS Installation python-eggs write permission error

Following Homebrew instructions on http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/OSX/Homebrew, Desktop-Full rosinstall, stops with this error message:
File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 928, in extraction_error
raise err
pkg_resources.ExtractionError: Can't extract file(s) to egg cache
The following error occurred while trying to extract file(s) to the Python egg
cache:
[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Users/Ross/.python-eggs/PyYAML-3.10-py2.7-macosx-10.7-intel.egg-tmp/tmpjfwmGh.$extract'
The Python egg cache directory is currently set to:
/Users/Ross/.python-eggs
Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  You can
change the cache directory by setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment
variable to point to an accessible directory.
How to I set write authority to this directory or other action to allow this file to be written?

A:

"How to I set write authority to this directory or other action to allow this file to be written?"
to modify permissions:
sudo chown -R $USER {directory/file}
sudo chmod -R u+rwx {directory/file}

chown changes owner to you the user and chmod adds read/write/and execute&search to you. Please replace {directory/file} with either a directory name (and the -R will recursively change everything within) or a file name. To learn more about these commands, type:
man chown

or
man chmod

in a terminal window and read the man pages.
