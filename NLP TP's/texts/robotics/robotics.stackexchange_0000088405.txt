Q:

Setting project name "debug_msgs" occurs error while "mydebug_msgs" is ok

when I build my msg project whose name is "debug_msgs" with ros2 bouncy, I get error as follow:
command:
   colcon build 

output:
Starting >>> debug_msgs
--- stderr: debug_msgs

Summary: 0 packages finished [1.21s]

but after I changed the project name to "mydebug_msgs", It goes well, could any one tell me why ?

A:

CMake uses a few keyword to identify libraries with special semantic: debug, optimized, and generic.
The code was supposed to only detect those but it turns out the regex was incorrect and matches the library in your case (starting with debug).
Please see the following PR which fixes the regex and allows you to build your package as expected: https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/pull/148
