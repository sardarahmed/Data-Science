Q:

What type of actuator should I use?

I need to find out if There is a way to get at least 60 Hz of linear Motion with at least 5 mm of stroke that I intend to make linear persistence of vision device(not rotating one)It must be small and light as possible. ( maybe 50 mm long and 10-15 mm diameter or around these) (less than 500 grams) The Load will be around 50 grams.  There are voice coils that is very expensive, can I use solenoids for instance or what do you recommend? 
Thanks 

A:

A few guidelines to help you search:
Max displacement: +/- 5mm. 
Frequency: 60Hz = 377 rad/s.
Now, some math:
$$
x = 0.005 \sin{(377 t)} \\
v = (377)(0.005) \cos{(377 t)} \\
a = -(377^2)(0.005) \sin{377 t)} \\
$$
Then, the max values are wherever the particular trig function is equal to 1, so:
$$
x_{\mbox{max}} = 0.005 \mbox{m}\\
v_{\mbox{max}} = 1.9 \mbox{m/s}\\
a_{\mbox{max}} = 710 \mbox{m/s}^2 \approx 72 \mbox{g}\\
$$
Now, $F = ma$, so the peak force you are applying is:
$$
F = ma \\
F = (0.3)(710) \\
F = 213 \mbox{N} \\
$$
Peak power is force times speed. 
$$
P = (213)(1.9) \\
P = 405 W \\
$$
Per your guidelines, you want (I'm assuming) a cylinder that's 0.05m long and 0.01m in diameter. This means that the volume is (approximately)
$$
V = Ah \\
V = \pi r^2 h \\
V = \pi (0.005)^2 (0.05) \\
V = 0.00000393 \mbox{m}^3 \\
V = 0.00393 \mbox{liters} \\
V = 3927 \mbox{mm}^3 \\
$$
Now, you can try looking at power density and see that you want 405W of peak power in a space of 0.00393 liters, or a power density of about $405/0.00393 = \boxed{103 \mbox{W/l}}$, or about the same power density as a Ferrari engine.
I'm not saying it's not possible, but good luck.
If you are a PhD student at a university, you should consider asking your committee members to guide you to another grad student for assistance with this. 
Typically I would vote to close an open-ended design/shopping question like this, but I figured I'd go through the steps to show that what you want isn't really attainable.
