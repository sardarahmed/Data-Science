Q:

Error while compiling modified cmd_vel_mux

Hi,
I am using ROS fuerte version and the simulator is USARSim. I use the ** velocity multiplexer (sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-yujin-ocs)** designed by YujinRobot(http://wiki.ros.org/cmd_vel_mux).
I modify the one header file and one cpp file, to incorporate one more subscriber (so that nodelet manager subscribes to amcl_pose topic). But when I compile the code following error appears.
make output

NOW ABOVE ERROR IS SOLVED BY FOLLOWING THE ANSWER
Problem OCCURS When I run FOLLOWING COMMAND
roslaunch cmd_vel_mux standalone.launch
http://pastebin.com/XnUkXRCZ
nodelet_manager and velocity_multiplexer nodes  don't get initialized
You can view the highlighted portion of the header file here

Please help..LOOK in the above TWO LINKS

As an aside, logging in as root and performing operations is not considered good practice. Everything you need can be accomplished using the 'normal' user.

A:

I suspect that you forgot to add
#include <geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped.h>

in  cmd_vel_mux_nodelet.h.
I´d recommend posting code directly or a link to it, as opposed to taking screenshots of it (as screenshots don´t allow copy/pasting code, eat bandwidth and are generally unwieldy)

Oh, thanks a lot. Now, there is no error while 'make'. But when I try to launch nodelet_manager, some error appears as updated in the question..

If a new error appears after solving the first problem, please do not exchange the original question. Any answers won't match any more and anyone that finds this problem later won't be helped. Open a new question for a new problem instead.

Now I use pastebin @Stefan Kohlbrecher. I have changed the question accordingly @dornhege.

Why we can't add our own function? Added a new question, please have a look http://answers.ros.org/question/157886/error-while-loading-nodelet-velocity_multiplexer/
