Q:

ros installation on mac architecture symbol error

Hi,
That is my first time programming on mac since I just bought a brand new mac book pro. When I try to install ros by following the wiki, I get this error :
 Linking CXX executable ../bin/rosplay
 Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
    "boost::filesystem3::path::wchar_t_codecvt_facet()", referenced from:
        ros::record::Player::open(std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, ros::Time, bool)in rosplay.o
    "boost::filesystem3::path::extension() const", referenced from:
        ros::record::Player::open(std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, ros::Time, bool)in rosplay.o
  ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  make[3]: *** [../bin/rosplay] Error 1
  make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/rosplay.dir/all] Error 2
  make[1]: *** [all] Error 2

The architecture isn't x86 on a mac...so I don't really understand this error, does someone happen to know why?

All modern mac's are x86 as of a few year ago.  And in the last year or so they switched to 64 bit.

A:

Adding
#define BOOST_FILESYSTEM_VERSION 2

immediately above the #include <boost/filesystem.hpp> line in ros_comm/tools/ros_record/Player.h at least gets it to build for me.
As yet untested; caveat compiler.

Confirming that this will let the package build, but probably not a long-term solution to this problem.

There's a ticket for a similar problem at https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4923
