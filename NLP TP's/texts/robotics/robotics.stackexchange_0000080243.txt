Q:

iphone 6s camera calibration parameters

How can I get camera calibration parameters for iphone 6s? I need the following intrinsic parameters:
Cam_fx: normalized focal length in x
Cam_fy: normalized focal length in y
Cam_cx: normalized camera center in x
Cam_cy: normalized camera center in y
Cam_s: normalized distortion factor
I tried using the PTAM camera calibration process but im getting some errors. Can anyone please suggest me some other way?

A:

After trying a few tools recommended here and various sources, the one that worked end to end is provided by the MRPT project.
It uses the pinhole method to calibrate the camera. It has worked fine on an iPhone 5, although I have little practice with the generated parameters at this point.
