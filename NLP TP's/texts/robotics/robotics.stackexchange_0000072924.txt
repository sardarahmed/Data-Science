How can I use Wireshark to capture ROS packets?

Hello,
I want to analyze ROS network traffic directly from wireshark. What are the steps to do that?

Capturing ROS traffic is no different from how you'd normally use Wireshark. If you don't yet know how Wireshark works, I suggest you find a suitable tutorial and read up on that first.
Using it 'with' ROS should then be easy.
