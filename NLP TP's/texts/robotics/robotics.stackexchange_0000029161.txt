Q:

ign gazebo collada meshes issue

I'm trying to spawn a model with dae texture files and they don't load correctly in the GzScene3D.
If you look the camera plugin, the texture was loaded well, but in the scene it is a mess.
I tried to use models from fuel, but all that have dae texture cause the same problem.
I'm using Ignition Citadel.

Any pointers where to find a solution are highly appreciated.

tweaking some parameters in the Colladaloader file may help, not sure though.

I don't know how I can change that parameters. I tried different versions and different computers and got the same issue.

Trying on different machines won't necessarily solve the issue when there's a problem with the .dae file. What I am trying to say is that try scaling your file in the blender or any other app.

Right, but I did not use the same mesh in the tests. I tried different models from fuel (models that was demonstrated in the tutorials). I tested with many models from fuel and all that use collada meshes have the same issue. This is not related with my collada mesh.

Did you solve the problem? I think that I have the same problem, if I see in ogre2.og say and error about textures

A:

Hello,
I solve the problem, I added export LC_NUMERIC="C" before to run ign gazebo.
The problem is described here
