A:

The ROS_DISTRO envrionment variable will tell you which release you have. You can run:
printenv ROS_DISTRO

on the command line and it will tell you.

And how do we know which version are we installing ? Coz i guess it is not mentioned in the installation instructions.

I think you need to export this variable (export ROS_DISTRO=bouncy  # or ardent : https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Linux-Install-Debians#install-ros-2-packages)

If you already have a distro of ROS2 installed then it will already be set

Yes, now I see it, I guess the documentation is updated within the last month.

Yes probably, this is all moving quite fast at the moment!
