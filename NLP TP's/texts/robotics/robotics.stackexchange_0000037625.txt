This usually means that the network is not configured properly.

A common cause is that the machine cannot ping itself.  Please check
for errors by running:

    ping faiz

Can you please give more information? Can you ping faiz? Did you go through the network setup steps? Did you try setting ROS_IP?

A:

Can you ping your own computer? If you execute:
ping faiz

Does the ping come pack? You could consider setting your ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME variables. For example  add:
export ROS_IP="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"

to your .bashrc, where the xs are your IP number. If you don't know where to find your IP, use ifconfig.
