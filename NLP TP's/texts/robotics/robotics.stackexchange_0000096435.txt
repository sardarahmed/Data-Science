Q:

Can I still use catkin init and catkin build when I can't install python-catkin-tools?

I'm using ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04. When I type sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools, I get this:
Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming. The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies: python-catkin-tools : Depends: python-catkin-pkg (>= 0.2.9) but it is not installable Depends: python-osrf-pycommon but it is not installable E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

A:

The straight answer to this would be no you cannot, seeing as python-catkin-tools provides the catkin program.
If it's not installed, you cannot run it.
However, the problem you show with python-catkin-tools not being installable is a known issue.
See catkin/catkin_tools#594 where this is being tracked.
Refer to #q353113 for a work-around (note: a workaround, this is not a solution).
