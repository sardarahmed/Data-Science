Q:

How to change light direction in rviz

How do I change the lighting direction in rviz?
So instead of the light coming from the left, I want it to come from the right :)
Thanks in advance.

Hi, thank you for the interest. For me it is also possible to change the placing of all the objects, but I thought there would maybe be an easier solution :)

I'm also trying to find that out. I want it to come from the sky. I'm pretty sure that you would have to modify a file in the source code from RVIZ that would affect the OGRE scene rendering.
