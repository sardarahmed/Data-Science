Q:

Minimal ROS installation

Hi all,
I'm working on a project for UDOO based robot and I would like to take advantages of ROS features.
I followed the tutorial on wiki.ros.org for UDOO.
When I have to choose which package install I choose ros-hydro-ros since I want a minimal installation
(other packages will be installed when needed).
I was surprised when list the content of /opt/ros/hydro/bin since roscore is not there!
So my question is: which package contains roscore?
More general: which packages are need to run ros  and develop basic packages (only message publish and receiver)?
Thanks for support
Alessandro

A:

So my question is: which package contains roscore?

$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
$ dpkg -S `which roscore`
ros-hydro-roslaunch: /opt/ros/hydro/bin/roscore

At least, on Ubuntu Precise, x86.
But I'm surprised that ros-hydro-ros does not include that.
