Q:

Generating Octomaps

Hi,
I can't find the script "generate_color_octomap_from_estimate.sh" for the evaluation on the Benchmark dataset.
There isn't in the RGBDSLAM package (http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~endres/rgbdslam/rgbdslam.tgz).
Where can I find it?
many thanks!
Francesco

A:

Sorry, forgot to add it to the archive.
It is contained now, so just redownload it.
Don't forget you need the octomap branch mentioned in section 2.4 on the wiki page.
