Q:

Wireless camera for usb_cam

I'm looking for a wireless camera solution that could feed what it sees into the usb_cam node. I want to experiment with ar_pose however the camera is to be mounted on a quadcopter and obviously running a cam would be disadvantageous. Is there a camera system that would work over short range (5-10 m or so) that would permit this?

@Chad Rockey experimented with a wireless camera at some point.

A:

You can try the Trek AI ball.  They are kinda expensive ($80) and run through batteries quickly, so I would power them externally.

There's a ROS MJPEG driver here:
