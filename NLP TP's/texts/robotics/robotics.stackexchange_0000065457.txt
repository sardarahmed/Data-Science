Q:

How can start contributing to Ros Development

I have previously worked on path planning for self driving vehicle at Autonomous Ground Vehicle Research Group in my college. I have worked on ROS and Gazebo and designed a planner for the vehicle based on ROS Navigation Stack. I am a beginner at open source programming. I wanted to inquire about the projects I can contribute for the development of Ros as a part of GSoc 15. It would be great to be associated with such a wonderful organisation.

A:

There are some possible projects listed at: http://wiki.osrfoundation.org/gsoc15 for GSoc 2015. You can also create your own. Find a package which you want to contribute to and consider contacting the maintainer to propose a project.
