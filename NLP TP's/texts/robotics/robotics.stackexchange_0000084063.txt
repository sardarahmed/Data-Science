Q:

Comparision time of ICP and NDT in Matching

Theoretically NDT is faster than ICP. But when I measure the time of NDT by clock_t, it costs 10s, while ICP costs only 0.2s through the same way. I don't know what the reasons could be. Thank you!

A:

Please check the implementation of ICP.
I guess it is implemented to use multi-thread or GPU acceleration.
By the way, NDT-D2D registration between two sets of about 3000 Gaussian components with multi-thread processing on Intel I7 CPU takes about 0.2-0.3 sec.
