Q:

erratic_navigation error before costmap

I have a problem with the navigation stack. I use Fuerte and tried to run a simulation with the erratic robot:
roslaunch erratic_navigation move_base_local.launch
â€¦.
NODES
  /move_base_node/local_costmap/
    voxel_grid_throttle (topic_tools/throttle)
  /
    move_base_node (move_base/move_base)

I guess they are connected, but I don't know where the problem is. Just installed it and tried to launch it and make the first steps. Any ideas?

This works, for whatever the reason: roslaunch erratic_navigation_apps demo_2dnav_slam.launch

A:

I have to start first the Gazebo simulator and set up a robot model like this:
roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch
roslaunch erratic_description erratic_mobile_base.launch

And then:
roslaunch erratic_description erratic_mobile_base.launch
