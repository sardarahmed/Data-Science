Q:

hokuyo model-based topic name

Hello every body,
I am trying to use the Hokuyo sensor for a multirobot simulation. I would like to have the laser publishing on a different topic based on the model name. Is it possible?
I tried to edit the sdf gathered from
laser tutorial
but it defines only a fixed topic.
Any suggestions?
Even on the basis of the namespace would work
Thanks
Andrea

A:

Solved, more or less. When defining the tag topicName, omitting the initial '/' will tell the plugin to use the robot namespace.
  <topicName>laser/scan</topicName>
