Thank you so much for your help! If I installed rgbdslam v2 on a thinkpad x220, can I use SIFTGPU? I have read your paper and I found that It is much better that other algorithms.

On mine, no. I am not sure whether there are x220 models with "real" GPU. However, I'll soon publish an update on github, where ORB is as fast and as good as SIFTGPU.
