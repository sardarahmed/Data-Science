Q:

.bashrc analog for windows 10

I am new to ros for windows and for using turtlebot3 I need to set environment the variable
set TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle

every time
in ubuntu, we use to add
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle

in .bashrc file so we don't need to perform it every time
how can I perform this in windows

Add the command in the .bat file that starts the terminal script.

A:

If you look at the ROS on Windows installation in step 6:
http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -arch=amd64 -host_arch=amd64&& set ChocolateyInstall=c:\opt\chocolatey&& c:\opt\ros\noetic\x64\setup.bat

It's calling for 2 .bat files, you can add your .bat file to this startup script by adding && then the name the path of your .bat file.
To learn how to create .bat file, check this tutorial:

Then you can add set TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle so you don't have to do it in every terminal.
