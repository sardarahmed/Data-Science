Q:

integrating available components with ROS

Hi there,
I have different robot application components, all written in C++, separately working. I would like to use only the communication capabilities of ROS, i.e Messages, Services and networking multiple PCs, to integrate these components. Is there any tutorial for this? Could someone please give me some hints how to do this?

A:

You can do the basic ROS tutorials for c++ first:
http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
Then you can write ROS nodes which use you existing c++ libraries and provide the messaging interfaces. For networking on multiple PCs, look here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
