Q:

How to import correctly an Assembly created in SolidWorks into Gazebo

Hi guys!
I'm trying to import a 3D model of a Fanuc robot into Gazebo. I've already created the URDF using the sw_urdf_exporter
plugin obtaining the following result.
What's next?
I succeed in importing a single part like in this tutorial http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=import_mesh&cat=build_robot.
Do I have to follow a similar procedure?

Thanks a lot!

A:

You'll need to create a model.config file (manifest.xml is deprecated) as shown in this tutorial. From there, you need to put it somewhere gazebo can find it. Either set GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH, or just put it in ~/.gazebo/models (I think that one works by default).
If you have further issues comment on this answer or update your question.
