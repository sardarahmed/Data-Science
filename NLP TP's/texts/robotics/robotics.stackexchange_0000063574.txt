A:

The issue is that you do not have a world frame in your /tf tree. As @forinkzan suggested you may need to run a SLAM or localization node which provide this mapping from world -> the robot's base, usually base_link or base_footprint.
If you just want to visualize stuff you can click on the drop down for the fixed frame and select some other frame to visualize in. The available ones will be listed in the drop down.

What if there is not drop down menu? I am running a SLAM package with the same issue and I get the data to come into the point cloud topic. However, odometery fails with the error (Fixed Frame [velodyne] does not exist.

there is no world in the fixed frame.
