Q:

Configure Eclipse to work with ROS and OpenCV

How to configure Eclipse Luna to work with ROS and OpenCV?
I followed the ROS IDE instrucitions and I have succesfully set up an eclipse project. On the OpenCV website in step 8 they tell to click on Settings in C/C++ Build tab. Unfortunately in my ROS project I don't have such an option. The picture shows the properties window of my project.
If I create a new project in Eclipse the C/C++ Build tab is where it should be.
How can I add OpenCV headers and libraries to my ROS project?

A:

Shouldn't the OpenCV include paths (because the libraries are not used in Eclipse) be added to your Eclipse project automatically if you have your package dependencies setup correctly (ie: you state your OpenCV dependency in your pkg manifest)?

Edit: I should've said: "you state your OpenCV dependency in your pkg manifest CMakeLists.txt".
The Eclipse project file generator only works with the information in the CMakeLists.txt, so you need to add it there.

I have such declaration in my package.xml file:  <build_depend>opencv2</build_depend> <run_depend>opencv2</run_depend> but #include <cv.h> produces an unresolved inclusion

It works. Thank you! I followed this tutorial and adapted it to ROS.

The 'official' ROS docs are at vision_opencv. But they seem similar enough to what you did.
