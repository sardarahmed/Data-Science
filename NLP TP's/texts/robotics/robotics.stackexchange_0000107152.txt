Gazebo Garden: How to publish the transform of elements in a simulation

I need the depth ground truth of a camera view in gazebo and decided to go with an rgbd camera which produces a pointcloud. In order to visualize this I need to somehow publish the transform of the rgbd camera. How can I publish such a transform in gazebo? I can transfer gazebo topics to ros topics with my setup but I don't know how to publish the transforms from the simulation in the first place. Any ideas?
I am working with a gazebo garden setup where I use a gz-ros2 and ros2-ros1 bridge in order to work with ros as well (I know this is not a good setup and the endeavor is to only use ros2 at some point.)

A:

You should be able to get the rgbd camera pose through the pose publisher plugin.
