Q:

Algorithm to pick up moving objects

Hello Everyone,
I am a newbie to ROS.
I have a task wherein there is a running conveyor belt with objects on it which have to be picked up a Robotic Arm and placed at some other location all with getting data from a Microsoft Kinect.
I would like to know of some ideas / algorithms that one may use in such a scenario to accomplish this task. Some help with some tools to accomplish this task would also be helpful.
Cheers,
Jalashwa

A team of researches at CMU did this a while back: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/files/planforsmoothpick_icra14.pdf and even got an article in IEEE spectrum about their work: http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/pr2-learns-pick-and-place-skills-gives-baxter-a-run-for-its-way-less-money

Hi Hendrix, I did spot that research paper a while ago.
Would you recommend me using MoveIt! for my application ?
I'm sorry if I sound a bit stupid :(

I'm not sure; I can't tell from their research paper if they were using MoveIt! or not.
