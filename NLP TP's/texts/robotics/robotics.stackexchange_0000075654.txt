Q:

TurtleBot on Jade ROS

I face a problem while running ~$ roslaunch turtlebot_example turtlebot_gazebo.launch
. I see on the website http://wiki.ros.org/action/show/Robots/TurtleBot?action=show&redirect=TurtleBot
The latest officially supported release is for indigo.
Is there any solutions for tackling this problem?
The Result while running command line is :
[turtlebot_gazebo.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot_example] nor is [turtlebot_example] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

A:

The TurtleBot stack is only targeting the long term support releases. All packages are in Indigo and most are in Kinetic already. There are no plans to release TurtleBot packages for Jade.

SO can I install kinetic on Ubuntu 15.05

I'm not sure what you mean by 15.05: The target platforms are defined in REP 3
