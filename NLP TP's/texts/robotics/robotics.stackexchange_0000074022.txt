I m new user of rviz
I am using Kinect 2 and want to see point cloud information
I want to see the cloud information in rviz however my fixed frame popup only shows map ... however in different tutorial i have observed many other frames availble in the pop up. How can i add these frames in my pop up menu and how these are useful. and for me which frame is important.
Plz reply with details keeping in mind that i m new user of ros and rviz thankss

haha ok got it ...

A:

@Orhangazi44 is right.
rviz displays all frames that are present in the tf tree (i.e. broadcasted to tf using a tf broadcaster), and, by default, just map.
If there are no other frames broadcasted, it will not show any. So you need to add respective tf broadcasters.
If you, however, just want to visualize the point cloud data in the frame it is sent in, it typically is enough to manually type the frame_id in which the data is published (check the header/frame_id field with rostopic echo) in the fixed_frame field in rviz.
