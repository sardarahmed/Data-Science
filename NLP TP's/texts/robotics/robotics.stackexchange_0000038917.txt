Q:

Can I get a latched topic with rosh?

I've noticed that if I start up a node, create a latched publisher, and then publish a single message (let's say on the topic foo), if I then go into rosh and do topics.foo[0], it will just sit there blocking. According to rosh's documentation, this makes sense, but is there a way to get a latched topic at all in rosh?

A:

It's quite possible that latched topic support  was not added to rosh yet.
