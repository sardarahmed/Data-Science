Hi,
I got problem on installing with procedure of openni_kinect (www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect).
Regarding 3.2 Sourse based installation (electiric), I cannot do " make and make install" and "make debian and sudo dpkg -i *.deb".
I wonder if I could have answer. Thank you.

Could you post the exact issue to as to get help.

A:

Is there a certain reason you're trying to build it yourself ? Following 3.1 works good enough for me;
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect
Remember its either 3.1 or 3.2, it is not necessary to do both.

Thank you I was confused. I was thinking I need to follow 3.1 and 3.2 as well. Thank you for you answer.
