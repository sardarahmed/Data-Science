Q:

ROS logs with robot upstart

I'm using robot_upstart to launch a single launch file when my system boots. I just noticed that when using robot_upstart the normal roslaunch log files do not appear under ~/.ros/log. I then run the kill all command and do roslaunch and the logs show up like normal. Does anyone know how I can enable logging with robot_upstart? Or if tthe logs are being stored elsewhere.
PARTIALLY SOLVED: I was getting an error trying to write the logs. I just never saw the error because, you know...  there where no logs. Here is a related question but it has no verified answer at this time.

A:

It looks like robot_upstart saves its own log file under /var/log/upstart/[job-name].log. This log file looks like it has all node messages for every run, as opposed to the normal roslaunch logs which create a separate file for each node each time roslaunch is called. I wish there was a better log file to look at but at least its something.
