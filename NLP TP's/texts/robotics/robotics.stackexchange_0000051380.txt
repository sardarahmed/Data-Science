Q:

no ros workspace after rebooting

ros doesn't keep the workspace in "fuerte" after rebooting my computer, I have to keep telling ros where the workspace is after booting the computer. Can anyone help assess what the problem is or how to solve it?

Did you source the setup.bash in the workspace in your .bashrc?

I am not sure what you mean, I just followed the tutorial from ros and it says to re-source with: source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash .... was there an extra step I had to do?

Thank you joq!

A:

When you run source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash, it only sets things up in the current shell (terminal window).  To get things to work every time you start a shell (terminal window), you need to add the line
source ~/fuerte_workspace/setup.bash

to the file .bashrc in your home directory.  This file is sourced every time you start an (interactive) shell.

This is what joq asked in the comment to the question.  I'm assuming that your answer was "no".
