Q:

Do servos stop at their limits automatically?

I'm moving from controlling a robot arm with basic time based motors controlled using a raspberry pi and python to a more advanced robotic arm that has servos (e.g HS-425BB). With the time based motors I must constantly keep track of the arms position (guess work) and make sure it doesn't over turn.
Do servos automatically stop if you give them a position that is outside of their boundaries rather than grinding the gears?

A:

I have worked with quite a few servos (Industrial and RC) and from my experience they don't come with a limit switch that actually takes the current off the motor when they hit a limit. They are however limited in rotation by the PWM signal you send them and are as such limited to a rotation safe area. 
It does become a bit more complicated when you link several servos into a robot arm as there is a chance that individual arm segments might hit each other or the ground or... . 
For a reference feedback i recommend measuring the internal voltage over the servo reference potentiometer as outlined in the following link:

This analog voltage gives you an indication of the actual servo position. This voltage can be sampled from eg. an Arduino board or any other board with an analog/digital converter.
I have done something similar with a hexapod robot, and it worked perfectly.

A:

Most PWM servos (including the one you indicated, the HS-425BB) do stop at their limits automatically. This can be useful for initial calibration as it allows you to move the servo to a known point.
