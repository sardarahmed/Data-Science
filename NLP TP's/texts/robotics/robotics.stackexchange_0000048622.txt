Q:

Kinect frame synchronization: does ros openni_launch provide message filters?

I am curious if the openni_launch package already provided message filters such as an ApproximateTime message filter.
I am getting a warning when running the Kinect such as:
[WARN] [1361652036.274076110]: [image_transport] Topics '/camera/depth_registered/image_rect' and '/camera/depth_registered/camera_info' do not appear to be synchronized. In the last 10s:
    Image messages received:      100
    CameraInfo messages received: 196
    Synchronized pairs:           14

Ubuntu, Precise, Fuerte

A:

Why do you want a ApproximateTime message filter? '/camera/depth_registered/image_rect' and '/camera/depth_registered/camera_info' should have EXACT same timestamps.
Do you use W-Lan? I think your problem is, that you have much more CameraInfo messages as Image messages, because you don't have sufficient bandwidth.
So you need a bigger queue_size.

I'm not sure what the problem is...I'm not using W-Lan.  I have the Kinect directly plugged into my computer.  I keep getting these warning messages when running fovis.
