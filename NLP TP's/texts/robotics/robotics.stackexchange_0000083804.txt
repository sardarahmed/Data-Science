Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Navigation

I have obtained a map using RTAB-Map. Now I want to use the point cloud obtained to navigate from a place in the map to the required goal created using the Kinect XBOX 360 and RTAB-Map. Please suggest how should I do it?

Hi there, this is a quite common task that is solved with the ROS Navigation Stack (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation)
You can install it like this:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation
assuming you have Ros Indigo installed, if you have Kinetic, just change it to kinetic.
Since you have a Kinect XBOX you also want to look into the Turtlebot navigation package (http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation)
You'll end up with something looking like this:

But for that t happen you need to convert your pointcloud to a laserscan, good luck for you there is a package for that ;)
Check it here: http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan
Afterwards, you use the navigation stack and create your map with the laser scan, it'll be as easy as publishing a 2D Nav Goal for your robot to navigate. Good luck!
