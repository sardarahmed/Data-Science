Q:

Localization on a robot grid

I have a skid steer drive train with an encoder on each side of the robot along with a gyro to measure the angle of the robot. The width of the robot is 26 inches. Using the encoders I would like to set up an x and y coordinate grid to know the pose of the robot and set up the system to go through waypoints to reach a destination. The robot has a starting reference point and I would like to go to another point in the area. Anybody have an idea of how to approach this?

A:

Possible approach:

Mapping
Localisation
Path planning (+ obstacle avoidance if there a need)

You can check out ROS (Robotic Operating System), which consists of many libraries and tools (including those for robot localization, mapping, path planning, etc.)
