Q:

rosjava_jni or rosjava

Hi, all,
Just wonder what the status of ROSJAVA (pure Java implementation) is now. I am at the stage of choosing between RORJAVA and ROSJAVA_JNI. Is ROSJAVA reliable and mature enough for use, at least for basic functions, e.g. service server/client? I know ROSJAVA_JNI is also partial implementation, but it seems to have been used by some libraries for quite a while. It looks ok for my task.
I do not need to run it on Android or similar, only on my PC. Is there any advantage of using pure java implementation then?

A:

rosjava_jni is no longer being developed, so you are best off using rosjava.  rosjava is regularly used to develop applications on Android, so, from a technology point of view, it is ready to use, though it is still in 'alpha' state and may have some API and tooling changes as it matures.
rosjava_jni and rosjava have different APIs, so you are better off in the long run using rosjava.
