Q:

How do I compute the feedforward terms in a control law using Matlab?

I have the following situation. I have computed the linear and angular velocity which are the controls for a mobile robot, which have the form:
$v_d=v_{fb}+v_{ff}$
$\omega_d=\omega_{fb}+\omega_{ff}$
now, I would like to define the acceleration controls, and I know that I can do it in the following way:
$a_v=(v_d-v_{actual})+\dot{v_d}$
$a_\omega=(\omega_d-\omega_{actual})+\dot{\omega_d}$
I would like to do this using Matlab\Simulink. This code is inside a Matlab function clock.
my question is:
Is there a way I can compute the feedforward terms $\dot{v_d}$ and $\dot{\omega_d}$ without computing them manually?
I would like to avoid to compute them manually since their expression is really complicated and it is almost impossible to not make mistakes.

A:

How are you calculating $v_d$ and $\omega_d$? Simulink has a derivative block, have you tried using that?
