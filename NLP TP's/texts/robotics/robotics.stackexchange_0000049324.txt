Is anyone developing a ROS wrapper for Segway RMP440 Omni or has already developed it?

A:

I assume the RMP440 Omni uses the new protocol used by the RMP440 (http://rmp.segway.com/about-segway-robotics/segway-rmp440-le-and-se/).  If so William's driver won't work on it.  We have a student in our group currently working on a wrapper for the new protocol.  I'm not sure of the status, but I'll check on it and try to post shortly.

@david.hodo I think you're right. The RMP400 Omni is a new model that came out last year. Look forward to hearing the student's progress. Thanks!

I know someone who contacted me about supporting the x440 (similar protocol), but when I declined he said that he implemented his own. I have pointed him to this question, so hopefully he can chime in later.
