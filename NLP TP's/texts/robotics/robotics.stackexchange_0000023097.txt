Vex Robotics- Falcon 500

I need two motors powerful enough to accelerate a 200 lbs robot at 10 ft/s^2. From doing the calculations, I know I am looking for a two 430 watt motors. I found the Falcon 500 motor on vex robotics website. But those motors are only 3 inches in length and weigh 1 pound. They are advertised to be able to provide the necessary 430 watts, but it is extremely hard to believe this due to its small frame and weight.
If anyone has had first hand experience with the Falcon 500 and used them to power and maneuver heavy robots, please tell me if two falcon 500 motors would be sufficient for this project.

A:

It depends on how many seconds you want to run the motors, and how many minutes you want to wait between runs.
Those motors are certainly not going to operate at 430 watts continuously. At 40 amps, the "brochure" suggests a 32C rise at 150 seconds, and the motor data shows an overtemp shutdown at 260 seconds.
They are targeted at the FIRST community, so if you don't abuse them I'd expect them to work really well, for a few months at least.
