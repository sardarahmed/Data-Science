Q:

Fuerte PCL/Flann Repo github.com/wg-debs no longer exist. Where was the source moved to?

Hi Everyone,
It has come to my attention that the "github.com/wg-debs" no longer exists.  This has been for some time the place where I pulled down the source for the packages in Fuerte, and the source for PCL and Flann.
Where do we get the source for PCL 1.5 and Flann that is needed by Fuerte?
I have found the other packages for Fuerte at the repo located in github.com/ros-gbp, but there does not seem to be a PCL 1.5 in there.
Thank you

A:

I figured out where the repo was moved to:
flann: git://github.com/ros-gbp/flann-fuerte-release.git
pcl: git://github.com/ros-gbp/pcl-fuerte-release.git
