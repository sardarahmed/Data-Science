Q:

Subscriber in sample_app of android_ndk not working

Hello everybody,
I'm currently trying to port a c++ Desktop Applicatioon to Android. I have been able to build the andoird_ndk sample app following this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/android_ndk/Tutorials/SimpleNativeActivityApplication
But when I start the app and publish a message from my workstation as described in the tutorial, the callback is never called, as i have verified with logcat.
To check the general connection, i have modified the test.cpp file to publish a single message before entering the while-loop and i am able to receive this message on my workstation.
Does anyone have an idea, what could cause this issue?
(Since I'm new to ROS, tell me if you need further information)

A:

After some debugging i found out that my network was not set up properly. I had to set the ROS_IP environment variable to my local ip.
