Q:

Connecting two remote networks over internet

I'm looking for suggestions on how to connect two networks over internet to use with ROS. This is as an attempt to collaborate between two universities so anything that can avoid bureaucratic juggling with network permissions would be best.
We can open up a port for the rosmaster to communicate between the two networks and we are able to see a listing of topics and services remotely. But no data can be read from the topics. I assume this is because when trying to do rostopic echo <topic> a p2p connection fails due to other ports not being open?

I have got the same problem, if you have solutions, please share.

A:

I think your problem is related to name resolution. As stated in ROS Network Setup,
all the machines need full bi-directional connectivity, on all ports. Moreover they have to resolve the name of each other. But I do not know how to solve these issues. I am also interested in.
