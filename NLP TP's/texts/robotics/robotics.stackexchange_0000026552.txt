Q:

How can I use ROS Msgs ind Gazebo

I followed this tutorial http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.5/ros_enabled_model_plugin, but when I tried to add the header of an own messages, the compiler can't find the package. How can I fix this issue?

A:

First, you'll need to include a lot more info for us to help you - including your package.xml and CMakeLists.txt (assuming you are using catkin), your version of ROS, etc.
I suggest you look at this updated tutorial:
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.9/Creating_ROS_plugins_for_Gazebo
Your tutorial link above is dead, by the way.
