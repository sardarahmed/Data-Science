Q:

Rviz not subscribing to visualization_marker?

I am trying to add points to rviz following the tutorial "Markers: Points and Lines". Even when I followed the code and instructions exactly like in the tutorial, I could not see the markers displayed in rviz. $rostopic echo visualization_marker showed that the topic was published well and continuously. When I tried $rostopic info visualization_marker, I realized that there was no subscriber to the topic. How come rviz was not subscribing to the topic? Any idea what is wrong?
Thanks! :)

Is RViz properly configured? Does it has any warning or error?

A:

So sorry, I skipped the first tutorial. I need to add a "markers" display first from the GUI to make rviz subscribe to the vizualisation_marker topic. Now it is working fine and displaying the markers.
