Q:

Can robot_localization be used with Noetic?

Is robot_localization not available for ROS Noeic?
I git clone the "robot_localization" Package and tried to do a "catkin build", but it skips as follows.
[build] Warning: Skipping package `robot_localization` because it has an unsupported package build type: `ament_cmake`
[build] Note: Available build types:                                           
[build]  - `catkin`                                                            
[build]  - `cmake`      

From my research, it seems that "ament_cmake" is a ROS2 specific build tool and cannot be used with Noetic. Please let me know if I am wrong.
Is there any way to use robot_localization with ROS Noetic?
Thank you.

A:

Yes.
Below are the two ways to install robot_localization in ROS Noetic:

Install from Pre-built Binaries (Preferred): Please use the following command:
 $ sudo apt install ros-noetic-robot-localization

Install from Source: To answer you completely, I tried this approach as well. Please see below:
 $ cd ros_ws/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization.git --branch noetic-devel
 $ cd ros_ws/
    $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
 $ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Dear ravijoshi.
Thank you for your patience.
And thank you for your advice.
Thanks to you, everything went well.
The only thing I did was change $ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release part to $ catkin build.
