Q:

depend on debian package not in rosdep database

How does one get rosdep to install an arbitrary debian package that looks like this...
foobar:
  Installed: 2.0.1-1ubuntu1
  Candidate: 2.0.1-1ubuntu1
  Version table:
 *** 2.0.1-1ubuntu1 500
        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/universe amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     2.0.1-1 500
        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/universe amd64 Packages

...and is unreferenced by rosdistro ?
Is my only recourse to contribute a rosdep rule to a rosdistro fork?

A:

I've got this working for me:
cat >/srv/foobar.yaml <<EOF
foobar:
  ubuntu: [foobar]
EOF

cat >/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/00-foobar.list <<EOF
yaml file:///srv/foobar.yaml
EOF
