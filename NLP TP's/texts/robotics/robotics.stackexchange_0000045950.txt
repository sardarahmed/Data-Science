Q:

How to install turtlesim under Fuerte?

A colleague of mine is in the process of learning ROS and he has encountered something odd in the Understanding ROS Nodes tutorial. Specifically step 1.1 Prerequisites instructs him to install the turtlesim. However when he executes the provided instruction he receives an error.
$ sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-turtlesim
[sudo] password for matt: 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-turtlesim

How is the turtlesim tutorial stuff supposed to be installed under Fuerte?

A:

Try installing ros-fuerte-ros-tutorial. According to http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlesim?distro=fuerte, turtlesim should be within that stack.
Update:
Too late. ;) Verifying before posting took too long...
Glad you solved it.
