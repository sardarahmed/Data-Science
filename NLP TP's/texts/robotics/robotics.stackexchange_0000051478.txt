Q:

rosjava installation

Iam trying to install rosjava with following steps.
mkdir ~/my_workspace
cd ~/my_workspace
rosws init
rosws merge /opt/ros/groovy/.rosinstall
rosws set --git --version=groovy-devel rosjava_core 'git://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core.git'
rosws update
source setup.bash
Everything seems to be working fine until I run the rosws update command.It gives the error as following.
[rosjava_core] Updating /home/jhansi/my_workspace/rosjava_core

Are you installing for ROS groovy?

A:

Hey,
First do not use rosws, that was what I was told. Install from source and run catkin_make.
ROSjava has been  catkinized. Basically what I did to install was to download into my work space from source https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core
cd into my work_space and run "catkin_make". It then nicely compile everything for me. I did run into an error at one point but it has been resolved here https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core/issues/156
If catkin_make does not work, you can cd into ROSjava package and just run ./gradlew as well. Or at least I could about a month ago.
Hope that helps :D

other potential bugs when it does start compiling for you, usually solved by setting JAVA_HOME, I ran into the same problem as this link and the second answer solved the issue for me

It gives the error as:     What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':rosjava_test:compile'.

Could not resolve junit:junit:4.8.2.
