Q:

Monitor multiple Turtlebots with 1 workstation?

This might not necessarily be ROS/Turtlebot question and instead general linux question, but is there a way to monitor multiple Turtlebots from a single workstation ROS machine using turtlebot_dashboard?
Looking at this tutorial, environmental variable is in use and it can contain only 1 host's name/address. It would be nicer to be able to observe dashboard of multiple bots on a single computer.
Thanks.

That tutorial is written for the on robot case, you can set your ROS_MASTER_URI in a new terminal session for each robot

A:

Open a new terminal
Export a new ROS_MASTER_URI for another turtlebot in that terminal
Run the dashboard
Tada! you have two dashboards running connected to multiple turtlebots :)
