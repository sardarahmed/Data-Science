Q:

How can I simulate baxter in MoveIt without a real baxter?

I follow the tutorials  Rethink Robotics MoveIt tutorial to install my baxter with MoveIt. When I run
$ ./baxter.sh

It shows:

EXITING - Please edit this file, modifying the 'baxter_hostname' variable to reflect Baxter's current hostname.

I don't have a real baxter robot,how can I simulate it with MoveIt ?

A:

If you wish to use the Baxter simulation, you need to first download and install the simulation framework according to the instructions at 
http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Simulator_Installation 
Once you've done that, you'll have to replace the baxter.sh line in your MoveIt command with this command 
/baxter.sh sim
