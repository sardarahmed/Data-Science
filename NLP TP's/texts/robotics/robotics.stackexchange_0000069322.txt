Q:

writing and running a code

Hi
Just a funny question for whom are clever in ROS!
I have read the tutorial just for well understanding checking I ask the following question? (Please do not refer me to Tutorial)
What are the main steps of a written and execution of C++ code in ROS
1-writing a C++ code
2-making cmake
3-run roscpp
Is there any other files that there is obligation to make before running?
(What about launch file or others? Is there any obligation?)
Thanks
Fi
