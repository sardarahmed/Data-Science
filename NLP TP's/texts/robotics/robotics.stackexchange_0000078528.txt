Q:

Navigation Stack : Speed of Robot

So finally got things working, again people on here are awesome and I am actually now reading a book on ROS to fill in the gaps.
I used code from https://github.com/DaikiMaekawa/navigation2d_example
Parameters on the Robot seem to be in
https://github.com/DaikiMaekawa/navigation2d_example/blob/master/param/base_local_planner_params.yaml
https://github.com/DaikiMaekawa/navigation2d_example/blob/master/param/costmap_common_params.yaml
My question is, does either of these files control the turning speed of the robot as it is struggling to turn on carpet?

A:

Yes, the file base_local_planner_params.yaml will control the turning speed (as well as the longitudinal speed). Specifically, the parameters: max_vel_theta, min_vel_theta, and min_in_place_vel_theta. These are standard parameters for the base_local_planner package. You will find their definitions here.
The second file you reference contains parameters for the costmap, which you can read more about here.
However, the maximum velocity setting may not be you problem. When turning on carpet you could be power limited, or also be experiencing excessive slip, which will not only lengthen the turning time, but also add time just for the localization to realize the robot has not turned sufficiently far.

Thanks for the help, thats awesome!

When you say power limited are you saying the motors are not powerful enough?
Comment by Steven_Daniluk on 2017-01-24:
It is possible. But without knowing anything about your robot I can't say for sure, I just though I would mention it since you emphasized the behaviour on carpet. A robot with small wheels, weak motors, and on plush carpet, could have difficulty moving.

Thank you, could I ask if max_vel_theta = 1 does that mean 100% power?
Comment by Steven_Daniluk on 2017-01-24:
No, that means 1 radians/sec. As per the definition of max_vel_theta on the base_local_planner link I provided: "The maximum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec".

Oh sorry I am pretty new to this, Now I just need to work out the actual value :)

No worries. Just always try to look at the documentation for whatever you are doing. Most information you need is usually there.
