Welcome! What package are you using?

A:

If you take a look at the velodyne tutorial you'll see that there's already a launch file that you can use. Just run
roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud 32e_points.launch calibration:=/home/user/32db.yaml

Note: set the calibration parameter to whatever your calibration file is.

Update:
It looks like it may not be supported:

This driver supports all current Velodyne HDL-64E, HDL-32E and VLP-16 models.

but the wiki says nothing about the 32C. Maybe you should file an issue.

yes I have done that but it's for HDL-32E module. I have got the calibration file in the flash drive and everything but need to create a new launch file for the VLP-32C module.

Please update your question with what you've done/attempted so far.

Have you come any further? I'm interested since I might get a VLP-32.
