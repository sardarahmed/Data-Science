A:

When you open Gazebo, you spin up two processes:

a server gzserver for simulating the physics, rendering, and sensors

a client gzclient that provides a graphical interface to visualize and interact with the simulation

It's also possible to run these processes separately.
You can read more on Gazebo's architecture on this tutorial.
