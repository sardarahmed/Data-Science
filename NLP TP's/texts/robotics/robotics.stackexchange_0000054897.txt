Q:

How to navigate with moving people or objects

Right now i have working a pioneer dx3 with navigation and gmapping.  The robot learns dynamically from gmapping and navigates the environment.  But i need to navigate with moving people in the environment and I dont know how to accomplish it.  Ive seen that eband_local_planner works, but as the person moves the path the person just walks is marked as obstacle.  So i need to be able to have an environment of moving people and clear the path they walk.  Any ideas will be appreciated
