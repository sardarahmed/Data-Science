Q:

Run node debug on a remote master

Hello everyone,
I have a question about IDEs and debugging.
I am currently working with a Baxter robot that has its own ROS core so whenever I need to launch a node I do that from a terminal where I set the master uri and other necessary variables (this is usually done automatically by a provided script). As my project becomes more complex it would be useful to use my IDE debugging utility but I could not find an option or a workaround to tell the IDE to run my code the same way.
Maybe you can give me a hint? I am currently using IntelliJ IDEs (pyCharm, IDEA, CLion) and I am mainly interested in the Python part.
Thank you!

A:

Finally found the problem. Apparently, you just need to launch pycharm from a baxterized terminal and it will work. Just sorucing ROS or modifying the desktop file as reported on the ROS wiki is obviously not enough.  Still, it would to have a way to set this inside the project or launch a "baxterized" PyCharm from the desktop launcher.
