Q:

Turtlebot with Groovy failed

Hi. I've got following error with turtlebot_bringup, in ROS Groovy.
I have followed http://ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot.
Anyone succeeded to run turtlebot in Groovy?
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/turtlebot_create/create_node/nodes/turtlebot_node.py:56: UserWarning: roslib.rosenv is deprecated, please use rospkg or rosgraph.rosenv
  import roslib.rosenv
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/turtlebot_create/create_node/nodes/turtlebot_node.py", line 65, in <module>
    from turtlebot_driver import Turtlebot, MAX_WHEEL_SPEED, DriverError
ImportError: No module named turtlebot_driver

It works with ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Try this version and check.

I get the same fatal error as @Hyon Lim when using a Create-based TurtleBot.  I am using Ubuntu 12.04LTS and the latest Groovy debs.  The file turtlebot_driver.py does not exist anywhere under /opt/ros/groovy.  It does exist under /opt/ros/fuerte.

Hello all,
Daniel Stonier already provided a solution on Turtlebot SIG:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ros-sig-turtlebot/To8BAPnLDeA
I copy/paste it here:
If you're using the create base these are only working from the turtlebot_xxx 2.0.0+ deb releases. I backported the turtlebot code to work with the create and bugfixed various things going from 1.9.x to 2.0.x - the first warning you have above is indicative of 1.9.x so I'm guessing that's what you have.
If you want to test the new release immediately. then can you try changing your ubuntu repository to use ros-shadow-fixed and upgrade.
Also make sure to check melonee's advice about the pip installed rospkg, rosdep, rosinstall, vcstools. Keep uninstalling them until nothing is left. I think everyone in our lab has been bitten by that one.
Cheers,
Daniel.

The error is gone now that I have the turtlebot_xxx 2.0.0+ deb releases on Ubuntu 12.04LTS and I can now teleoperate the Create.  Thanks!
