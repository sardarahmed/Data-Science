Q:

How to install ROS2 Bouncy from source

I would like to install ROS2 Bouncy from source on my Ubuntu 16.04 machine. I've been following these install instructions: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Linux-Development-Setup and only changed the --rosdistro parameter from crystal to bouncy in "Install dependencies using rosdep" section. However, I keep getting crystal as an output of 'printenv ROS_DISTRO" command after sourcing the workspace.
What else needs to be changed in order to obtain Bouncy source?

A:

You'd most likely have to change the URL to the ros2.repos file in the Get ROS 2 code section from pointing to the latest-release to bouncy (which are basically two different branches in the ros2/ros2 repository).
So:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/release-latest/ros2.repos

should be:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/bouncy/ros2.repos

See also the Maintaining a Source Checkout of ROS 2 page.

You might be able to use rosinstall_generator as well:
rosinstall_generator --tar --deps --rosdistro=bouncy  ros_core > bouncy.rosinstall

But I'm not sure whether that will result in a successful build on Xenial (as Xenial support for Bouncy is basically "Tier 2").

I used the first solution you proposed and it worked, thank you.
