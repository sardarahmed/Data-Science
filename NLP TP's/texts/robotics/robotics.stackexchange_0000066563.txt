Q:

ROS nodes for aerial vehicle localization

Hey there,
I'm developing an aerial vehicle which is equipped with a GPS, IMU and bottom camera (pointed at the ground for target tracking).
I was looking for a way to fuse the data, with two objectives:

Obtaining a coordinate for the "drone" localization (I could assume it starts at (0,0))

Extrating a position of the detected targets (on the "local coordinate system" and GPS information)

Which nodes will prove useful for this application?
Thanks in advance

A:

I think robot_localization may be what you are looking for.

Thanks for the help! That seems to be what I need, but does it work with only GPS and IMU?

On the ROS wiki page for robot_localization you can see an image showing that you can also use a camera and a 3D sensing device, provided that you extract the necessary information from them. For the camera you may use something like viso2_ros package.

Does that mean that the GPS combined with the IMU is not enough?
Another question: The IMU data used by robot_localization needs the pose? or only the raw data (linear accelaration and angular velocity)?
