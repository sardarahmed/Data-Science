Q:

How to send a message from a non ROS node to a ROS node

Hello,
Is it possible to have a program on a remote device which doesn't have ROS installed that sends messages to a ROS node on another device (which has ROS)?
I was thinking to start small and have a small c program that sends an int via a udp channel, but I'm not sure how this is going to be received, or published to a topic. Any guideline on how you would go about this?

A:

You probably shouldn't try to publish directly to a ROS topic from a non-ROS system (this would effectively mean re-implementing the ROS libraries for some other platform, which probably isn't what you want to do).
Instead, the common pattern here is to write a gateway node which communicates over standard TCP or UDP on one side, and publishes ROS messages, and to run this node on your ROS system.

To add to this: alternatively (depending on the amount of integration desired), you could use something like rosbridge or perhaps cROS.
