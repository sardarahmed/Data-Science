Q:

virtual memory error while making catkin class_loader

Hi everyone,
I am trying to install class_loader on Gumstix Overo(ARM Cortex-A8). However, I got the following error while I try to catkin_make it.
root@linaro-alip:~/catkin_ws/build# make [ 20%] Built target console_bridge Scanning dependencies of target class_loader [ 40%] Building CXX object class_loader/CMakeFiles/class_loader.dir/src/class_loader.cpp.o
virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory
make[2]: *** [class_loader/CMakeFiles/class_loader.dir/src/class_loader.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [class_loader/CMakeFiles/class_loader.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I can make other catkin packages such as dynamic_reconfigure, but I have no idea why I cannot make class_loader. Is it because ROS cannot find libpoco-dev which class_loader depends?
Thanks for any help in advance!

Ok, the problem is fixed when I restart the Gumstix Overo.
