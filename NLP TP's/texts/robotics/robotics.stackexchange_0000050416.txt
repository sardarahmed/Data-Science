A:

I think you still have the CD ROM option ticked in your Software Sources:

If ticked, Ubuntu will install packages from the installation media rather than downloading from the internet.
After un-ticking it, reboot the system and follow the steps given here, that should do.
Update:
Open the sources.list file in /etc/apt folder. Check if the first line that points to CD-ROM is un-commented. If un-commented, comment it and try the apt-get command.
