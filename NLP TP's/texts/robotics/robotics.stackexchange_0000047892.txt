Q:

why do I get an Error when I set ROS_WORKSPACE?

Hi, I have installed Ros_groovy. And I  am creating my workspace with the tutorial:
"Installing and Configuring Your ROS Environment"
and everything goes okay, until I write:
john@john-G41D3C:~$ rosws set ~/groovy_workspace/sandbox
ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.
I try even with other name of my workspace, but i get the same error:
john@john-G41D3C:~$ rosws set ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox
ERROR in config: Command requires a target workspace.
What am i doing wrong?

A:

Did you create a new overlay first? $rosws init ~/groovy_workspace /opt/ros/groovy
