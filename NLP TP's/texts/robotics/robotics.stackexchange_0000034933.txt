Q:

Installing Simple Arms

Hello!  I was trying to follow the turtlebot arm setup tutorial and I got the following error when trying to install simple arms:
$ rosmake --rosdep-install simple_arms
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['simple_arms']                             
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/marc/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20111013-160200
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['simple_arms'] to:
[]                                
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['simple_arms']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

Does anyone have an idea of why I am getting this error, and how I should go about fixing it?
In addition to this, I am getting the following error upon trying to run the next step, to install the turtlebot_arm software.
marc@marc-howard:~/ros$ hg clone hg https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot_arm
abort: repository hg not found!

I don't know if this is because of the previous problem or if that is it's own problem.  Any help would be appreciated!  Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!  I have attached my command history for getting it set up below so that everything can be seen:

Thank you, the new one worked!  I just want to let you know that I just copied and pasted from the tutorial, however, so I went and updated that!

it looks like your hg clone command is wrong.. hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot_arm

A:

Is simple_arms actually on your ROS path (is ~/ros on your path? can you "roscd simple_arm_server"?). You might also try a "rospack profile" to update things.
Also, I just updated the ROS tutorial, you can actually install simple arms from debs now:
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-simple-arms

turtlebot_arm will be in debs shortly.

~/ros is on my path.  I was not able to resolve this issue, but the deb install worked fine.  Thank you very much!
