Q:

Mathematical Moddeling of Elastic Robots

We can easily compute the rigid robot kinematics and dynamics. There is many resources, simulators and modelling tools about it. But i couldnt find any of these for elastic robots. Can you suggest resources and modelling tools?

A:

You can use Finite Element Anlysis (FEA) tools like Abaqus. Also please look this paper.
