Q:

Turtlebot: Live USB Install can reconfigure for ASUS Xtion Pro?

I have turtlebot and I use live USB Install(ROS groovy) which I have got when I buy turtlebot, Now I want to change Kinect to ASUS Xtion Pro , what should I do? I tested with turtle_follower with ASUS Xtion Pro, nothing happens , I aslo use command "rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure" , it just recognised the follower_velocity parameter, after I do like this step in this web www.isep.ipp.pt/roswiki/turtlebot%282f%29Tutorials%282f%29groovy%282f%29Asus%2820%29Setup.html, and command "rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure", it recognised the camera parameter, but turtlebot didnt anything.
Must I use 'Deb Installation'? Because I see ' Live USB Installation: This is pending information/testing of the live usb release.' for ASUS Xtion Pro.

A:

If you used the Live CD the instructions should be similar to the Debian install. It may require some slight tweaks but should work.
