Q:

Gazebo ignition (garden/fortress) attaching model to arm

I'm trying to attach a moving object with inertia to a robotic arm. I saw that there are plugins for detaching joints but is there a way to do the opposite and attach one model to another via a joint? preferably it would maintain its velocity and angular velocity till acted on by the arm.
If not, then could 2 separate SDF models be designed one with the model attached, then swap one model for the other during simulation?

A:

The detachable joint plugin can also attach two models (specifically, links from two different models) together with a fixed joint. Here's an example of how that's done in code
