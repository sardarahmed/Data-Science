Q:

Robot_localization ekf vs ukf process noise

Attempting to compare results from both ekf and ukf (ubuntu, indigo).  Would one expect to use the same process noise covariance matrix for both?  Thanks

A:

Both filters use the same process noise covariance matrix parameter. However, I'm guessing what you're asking is whether the output estimate error covariance matrices would be the same for the UKF and EKF. I've never done any analysis, but I would expect them to be similar, but certainly not identical. They use different methods for projecting the state and error covariance matrices forward during prediction.

Thank you Tom.  That verifies my assumptions.  Still tuning Q matrix and hoped that effort would apply to both ekf and ukf.  Regards.

I'd say that if you use the same process_noise_covariance for both/either, then that ought to work.
