A:

RGBDSLAM V2 is available and works well. There is a decent amount of explanation and instructions here:
http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/
The documentation lists it as using openni_launch, but it works with freenect_launch as well.
One note about installing RGBDSLAM V2 is that you may experience an error during compiling due to SiftGPU, such as *** [build/CuTexImage.o] Error 1. If this happens, you can adjust the CMakeLists.txt file to turn off SiftGPU by changing the line set(USE_SIFT_GPU        1) to set(USE_SIFT_GPU        0).
Hopefully this can get you started.

Sorry, I didn't explicitly state that it works for Indigo. Some of the documentation is outdated, but if you look on the GitHub link there will be a branch for Indigo, which is fully functional.

thank you for your help. i git cloned the package to my workspace , but while executing "rosdep install rgbdslam_v2"
i get following error:
ERROR: ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource rgbdslam_v2
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros

Two things to mention here,

The package name is rgbdslam, not rgbdslam_v2. If you look in the launch files thats how it is referred to. So try running rosdep install rgbdslam.
Based on the error output from Rosdep, it doesn't look like you have a catkin workspace setup. Did you clon
