Q:

Mark / tag detection - Indigo, help!

Hi,
I tried to do tag recognition with ardrone_autonomy, but it is not working.
Is it possible to use this mechanism in Gazebo? (with tum_simulator package)
Please check screen: image description http://snag.gy/Opmr5.jpg
I also read this information here but I have no idea what I am doing wrong.
Is it necessary to do camera calibration even using Gazebo?
I also find that there are other option to do tag recognition, but It will also work in Indigo?
Packages like: http://wiki.ros.org/ar_pose or http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar
I don't have a lot experience with ROS, please tell we, what is the simplest way to do this? Which option will be better and simpler?
Thank you for your support.

Edit:
I tried to install ar_pose, is this version compatible with ROS Indigo?
Or I should use sth like this: https://github.com/srv/ccny_vision/tree/indigo/ar_pose/launch ?
Please help.

A:

I found answer to my problem, according to tum_simulator_wiki tags are not implemented.
