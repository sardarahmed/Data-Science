Q:

Why isn't the Visualizing Turtlebot Kinect data tutorial working?

I am trying to use the Visualizing Turtlebot Kinect data tutorial. I run the command on the turtlebot, and start rviz on my laptop. I then add a camera, and set a topic without a problem. Finally I don't get any visualization and rviz says it is getting input.
Rviz:
rosrun rviz rviz -d rospack find turtlebot_navigation/nav_rviz.vcg
10. Camera (Camera) CameraInfo  No CameraInfo received on [/camera_info].
Topic may not exist. Image  No image
received Image Topic 
/camera/rgb/image_color

Turtlebot:
turtlebot@turtlebot-0169:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch

Comment by mmwise on 2011-09-18:
your console output looks correct/ Can you rostopic hz /camera/rgb/image_color?

A:

I wasn't setting ROS_HOSTNAME on the turtlebot. So it was defaulting to the hostname, like ROS_HOSTNAME=turtlebot-0169. My laptop couldn't resolve turtlebot-0169, and so it couldn't pull the data for rviz.
