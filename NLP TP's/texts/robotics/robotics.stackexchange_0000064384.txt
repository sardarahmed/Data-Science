Q:

how to install ccny_g2o

Hi everybody
I need to install ccny_rgbd_tools stack but I am getting errors, and none of the suggested solutions helped. Therefore I decided to install ccny_g2o package first. I have cloned the the source file but I dont know how to install/rosmake it. I have tried both commands:
    rosmake ccny_g2o
    rosmake socrob-ros-pkg

and I get error.
I'm using ROS fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04
I get errors when running "rosdep install" and also when running "rosmake"
when I rosmake the latest version of ccny_rgbd_tools from  https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_rgbd_tools.git, I get the following result:
In the last part of the result, it is mention that "Halting due to failure in package lib_rgbdtools."
result for rosmake latest ccny-rgbd-tools
