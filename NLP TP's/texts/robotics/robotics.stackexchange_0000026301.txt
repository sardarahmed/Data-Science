Q:

DRCSIM: When will pelvis height control work with STAND and MANIPULATE modes of BDI Sim interface?

Using latest drcsim-nightly build, the system is using Sim Interface 1.0.8.
When will the next version be released? (I see 1.1.0 is in testing)
When will the use_desired pelvis_height control start working?
(It does not seem to impact MANIPULATE in the current release.)

A:

It's supported in 1.1.0, and pending this pull request review and merge.  Please see the DRCSim RoadMap for details on ROS API changes.

The road map doesn't give an expected date.  I presume it will be released prior to the DARPA "code freeze" May 17th.  Will 2.6 (including 1.1.0 interface) be released prior to that date for testing?

We'll make a release after Qual's over.  For now, you can get it by sudo apt-get install drcsim-nightly.
