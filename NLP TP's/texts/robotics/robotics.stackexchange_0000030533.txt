Q:

can ROS be installed on Ubuntu 9.10?

Hi All,
The ROS wiki has tutorials about installing ROS on Ubuntu 10.10 & 10.04, bu for some certain reasons I need to keep my current Ubuntu 9.10. Does anyone know if there will be problems if I install ROS on Ubuntu 9.10? Or has anyone tried that?
Thanks,
Zhu

A:

I believe that according to REP 3, that Box Turtle and C Turtle both support Ubuntu 9.10, Karmic Koala. CTurtle Ubuntu installation instructions
That's not to say that you couldn't at least attempt to install Diamondback or latest on 9.10, but you may have a longer road ahead than just the ROS installation guide.  You may have to add additional packages to Ubuntu in order to support the newer dependencies that come with Diamondback.
