Q:

How to change the output of a /cmd_vel topic?

Hi,
I'm currently working on a project with a BlueRov2 and I measured the global speed (with motion tracking cameras) of the ROV for different input in the /cmd_vel topic and now I have the equation that matches the input (in the topic) to the real speed.
What I would like to do is to change the coefficient (according to my equation) so that when I publish (for exemple) linear x=0.1 my ROV goes to 0.1 m/s (in real life).
I'm quite new to ROS and I have no idea on how to do that, could somebody advise me on what's the best solution would be ?
Thanks !
(I'm using ROS melodic btw)

A:

One option is to create a new node that subscribes to the /cmd_vel topic and does the transformation that you're looking for and publishes the transformed data and then have the robot subscribe to that topic instead of the /cmd_vel.
