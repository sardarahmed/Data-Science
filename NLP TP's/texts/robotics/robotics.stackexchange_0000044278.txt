Q:

Phidget interfacekit 8/8/8 outputs

My phidgets interfacekit 8/8/8 works great with the sensors (inputs). However it also has 8 outputs. Can someone tell me if these can be used as well? I have found an example for the sensors here:
http://mediabox.grasp.upenn.edu/roswiki/phidgets_ros.html#InterfaceKit_ROS_API
And another package here: http://ros.org/wiki/phidgets
But the documentation is either missing or vague..
However the usage of the outputs is not documented..or am I missing something?

A:

http://ros.org/wiki/phidget_ik allows you to use the outputs, although it doesn't provide a ROS API (see http://ros.org/doc/api/phidget_ik/html/classPhidgetIK.html for the class description). Another option would be the stack at https://launchpad.net/phidgets-ros-pkg .
