Q:

Miss libdc1394-dev in Diamondback

When I built camera1394 package, I was told I missed libdc1394-dev as shown below.

$ rosdep install camera1394

Failed to find rosdep libdc1394-dev for package trunk on OS:ubuntu version:natty
rosdep install ERROR:
failed to install libdc1394-dev

My ROS works on Ubuntu 11.04. My current ROS version is Diamondback which should support Natty. And It seems like libdc1394-22-dev is the right library on Ubuntu, not libdc1394-dev.
How can I solve this problem? Thanks for help!

A:

Fuerte is not supported on Ubuntu Natty. How did you install it?
If you had the Fuerte version of rosdep, it should say:
$ rosdep resolve libdc1394-dev --os=ubuntu:natty
#apt
libdc1394-22-dev

Although Fuerte may have problems running Natty, I would expect camera1394 itself to work OK.
Overall, I recommend either upgrading to Ubuntu Precise or Oneiric, or going back to ROS Electric.
EDIT: Now you mention Diamondback, which is supported on Natty (though not actively at this point).
Why can't you install ros-diamondback-camera-drivers using apt-get?
I don't know why the Diamondback rosdep is not working correctly for you. Nevertheless, you should be able to install that library by hand and compile the camera driver:
$ sudo apt-get install libdc1394-22-dev
$ rosmake camera1394 --no-rosdep
