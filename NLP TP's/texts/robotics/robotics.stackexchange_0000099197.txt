Q:

How to decompress compressed image topic?

Hello people,
I have a question on how to decompress image topics. I have a /D435/color/image_raw/compressed image and I am interested in decompressing it and get a new  /D435/color/image_raw topic. My search led me to the image_transport package but probably I am not using it correctly. I am interested in using the nodes it has because I have 0 knowledge of cpp and I can not use the api. So far I've tried this and I got the following warning.
rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=/D435/color/image_raw/compressed  raw out:=/D435/color/image_raw

[ WARN] [1622914313.899141980]:
[image_transport] It looks like you
are trying to subscribe directly to a
transport-specific image topic
'/D435/color/image_raw/compressed', in
which case you will likely get a
connection error. Try subscribing to
the base topic '/D435/color/image_raw'
instead with parameter
~image_transport set to 'compressed'
(on the command line,
_image_transport:=compressed). See http://ros.org/wiki/image_transport
for details.

Any idea how to cope with this or any other way to do it?? Thank you in advance.

A:

Listen to what the error says and instead try:
 rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=/D435/color/image_raw  raw out:=/D435/color/image_raw
