Q:

ros_control packages missing from Jade

I've just updated to Jade, and I'm having trouble running a Gazebo simulation using my previously working packages.
Right now I'm focused on this error:
File "/home/sam/aav-ros-car/aav_car_ws/src/aav_description/nodes/ackermann_controller.py", line 125, in 
    from controller_manager_msgs.srv import ListControllers
ImportError: No module named controller_manager_msgs.srv
I am seeing this too, though I think it's unrelated:
/opt/ros/jade/lib/gazebo_ros/gzclient: 17: .: Can't open /usr/share/gazebo//setup.sh
/opt/ros/jade/lib/gazebo_ros/gzserver: 22: .: Can't open /usr/share/gazebo//setup.sh
It looks like I am missing the service message definitions for ros_control, and that according to the wiki, this ought to be solved by sudo apt-get install ros-jade-ros-control ros-jade-ros-controllers.  But that doesn't work either:

/opt/ros/jade$ sudo apt-get install ros-jade-ros-control ros-jade-ros-controllers
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-ros-control
E: Unable to locate package ros-jade-ros-controllers
This is on a standard 64-bit Intel system running Ubuntu 14.04.  Here's the contents of my /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main
My system seems to otherwise be working fine.

A:

I don't know why, but according to debbuild/jade.html?q=controller_manager_msgs, controller_manager_msgs (and almost all other ros_control packages) are not yet available in the public ROS package repositories. They should be installable from the shadow repository though.
That would explain why you can't apt-get install ros-jade-ros-control. Were you able to install any of the other ros_controlpackages on Jade?

Thank you so much! No, I hadnt' tried. It looks like the ros_control packages haven't been released for Jade yet. It hadn't occurred to me that a ROS release might not include such a critical set of packages. I assumed the fault was mine.

The packages have been released, they just haven't reached the repositories most people use to install ROS from. If you setup your system to use the shadow-fixed repository (see the wiki page I linked), you can already install them on your Jade system. Otherwise, wait for the next sync.

Also: you can always build packages from source. I assume that is what most users have been doing with ros_control.
