Q:

how to make ROS to work on a microcontroller like PIC24

Hi,
I am doing research on CubeSat (a small satellite) It contains PIC24 microcontroller, so I want to know that can we install ROS in a microcontroller like other RTOS.
If we can install please guide me how to make it or what are the prime requirements??
I am completely new to this field please provide information from basic, I feel its complicated.

Thanks & Regards
Rama K Ande

Yes it is complicated :)

I am not sure a PIC24 can run linux and then ROS on top of it. I don't think this is possible. Even if it is, I personally haven't heard anyone talk about it. Take a look here and here to see if you can meet the hardware requirements.

The hardware requirements are also very dependent on what functionality you want to get out of ROS.  If you want to run a GL accelerated simulation that won't work.  If you want to do basic IO it will be much easier.
