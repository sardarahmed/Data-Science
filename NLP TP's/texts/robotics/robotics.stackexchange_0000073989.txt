Q:

Diagnosing issues with bloom + github two-factor authentication

I am trying to release a package with bloom, but I also have two-factor authentication on my github account.
I tried following these instructions:
http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/GithubManualAuthorization
and have a ~/.config/bloom file with my private github token. However, bloom still fails to authenticate:
==> git push --dry-run
Username for 'https://github.com': felixduvallet
Password for 'https://felixduvallet@github.com': 
remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/felixduvallet/grasp-synergy-release.git/'
Cannot push to remote release repository.

Is there a way to diagnose the bloom+github authentication by itself?

A:

The way I get around this is by adding the following to my .gitconfig:
# Always use ssh for github, even if the remote URL uses https or git                                                                                                 
[url "git@github.com:"]                                                                                        
  insteadOf = git://github.com/                                                                                
[url "git@github.com:"]                                                                                        
  insteadOf = https://github.com/     

                                                                    

Then just make sure that you've added the your ssh key from the computer you are on to your github profile.
