Q:

Is ros-perception/open_karto different from nav2d_karto/OpenKarto?

The README in https://github.com/ros-perception/open_karto says it's a catkinized version of SRI International's OpenKarto library.
In https://github.com/skasperski/navigation_2d/tree/master/nav2d_karto/OpenKarto, Sebastian Kasperski has included a copy of the OpenKarto library (non-catkinized).
The question is, why does the source code look so different? Compare open_karto/src and open_karto/include/open_karto with nav2d_karto/OpenKarto/source. Was the library refactored as part of the catkinization?
Most importantly, are the two more or less equivalent?

A:

I think the version used in nav2d_karto was called "OpenKarto 2.0" on the SRI-Homepage, so maybe the version in open_karto is the original one.

I tried to confirm, but the code.ros.org link mentioned on SRI International's announcement is ofc not working any more.

I'll see if I can get one of the authors or maintainers of the open_karto package to comment.

I noticed this in the Authors file of open_karto: Karto Open Source Library 1.0, However, there's also a new open-source Karto commit message (https://github.com/ros-perception/open_karto/commit/def830d7c019e7b75bb1face379cbaceb070e5f7) that coincides with the date of the 2.0 SRI announcement.

To top that of, the copyright note in nav2d's version of Open Karto reads Copyright (C) 2006-2011, SRI International (R). The "2011" confused me even more. It's as if there was another release after the May 2010 release of Open Karto 2.0
