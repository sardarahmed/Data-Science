Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

Please tell us how you installed ROS. Any tutorials you followed? catkin_pkg is a base package and should have been installed for you.

Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE:/usr/local/bin/python

are you using some custom version of Python? Built from source?

Hi,
I just followed instructions from
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

A:

Your version of python is in /usr/local/bin/python ; this means that at some point you've installed a custom version of python, and you're not using the system's version.
Your custom version of python probably isn't finding the system-installed python libraries. The general options here are to either remove the custom version of python, or install the required python packages where it can find them. Which option is better depends on why you installed a custom version, and whether you're still using it.
