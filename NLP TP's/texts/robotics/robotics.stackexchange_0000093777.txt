Q:

Invisible robot model in Rviz

Hello, I'm new to rviz and I encountered a problem while i was trying to run project from this repo . When im working on Gazebo i can see a whole model of the robot but when i try to do the same on Rviz i can see only laser scanner model.

Full code is available HERE.
The only thing I've changed is when i was trying to run for example gazebo i had errors which were saying that something is wrong with mybot.xacro, I've changed the type of point separated values were typed from
 <box size=".4 .2 .1"/> 

to
<box size="0.4 0.2 0.1"/> 

end everything work fine except the thing i cant see the model in Rviz.
I'm working on Ubuntu 18.05 LTS

Additionally: please attach your screenshots directly to the question, instead of linking to an off-site image host. That way we keep this post self-contained.
I've given you sufficient karma for that.

A:

I'm not sure, but as you mention your robot model is invisible in RViz, perhaps this is #q272692. Worth checking.

Edit:

was about to say that this doesn't work but then I've typed first source devel/setup.bash and then export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" - finally it worked !

you'll probably want to add that line to your .bashrc to avoid having to retype it every time.
Note that this will change the way your OS represents/encodes/decodes floating point nrs though.
Finally: according to ros/urdfdom_headers/issues/45 - comment the fixed version of urdfdom_headers should finally be released as an update to Ubuntu Bionic.
So you should not need to override LC_NUMERIC any more in the near future -- after installing that update.
