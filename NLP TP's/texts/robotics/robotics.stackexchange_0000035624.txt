Q:

rosserial custom message compilation problems

I have updated rosserial to 0.3.0, and as far as I can tell also updated everything else along with it.  I have a custom message defined and now my rosserial_arduino sketch won't compile.
The compiler was complaining about my message being an abstract type so I added const to the end of the serialize function definition.
When I use make_library.py to recompile the message it has an error about Header. I get
"roslib.msgs.MsgSpecException: sensor_state.msg: Header header is not a legal message type"
I'd appreciate a pointer in the right direction please.

A:

SOLVED. My message definition file (.msg) had some Tab characters separating the type and the name.  When I removed those the message compiled, and then my sketch would compile.
