Q:

Installing rqt_graph in ROS2 Dashing

I am trying to install rqt_graph for ROS2 to visualize the ROS nodes and the computation graph.
I have ROS2 dashing installed in the docker (using the Autoware.Auto class/tutorial)
After entering ade and sourcing the setup.bash in Autoware.Auto, I use the following command:
sudo apt-get install ros2-dashing-rqt_graph
and I get the following error:
Unable to locate package ros2-dashing-rqt-graph
Could anyone help me out here? Thank you!
