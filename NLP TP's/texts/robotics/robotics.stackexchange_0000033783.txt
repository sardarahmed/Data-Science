Q:

rosbag results in OSError

Hello all,
I'm trying to run this tutorial, but rosbag fails to record data. I tried both the specified instructions
rosbag record -a

as well as recording a single topic
rosbag record /turtle1/command_velocity

but either results in the same error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/mrath/ros/ros/bin/rosbag", line 35, in <module>
    rosbag.rosbagmain()
  File "/Users/mrath/ros/ros_comm/tools/rosbag/src/rosbag/rosbag_main.py", line 807, in rosbagmain
    cmds[cmd](argv[2:])
  File "/Users/mrath/ros/ros_comm/tools/rosbag/src/rosbag/rosbag_main.py", line 115, in record_cmd
    os.execv(recordpath, cmd)
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

I'm running ROS in OS X Lion, which I suppose is the problem, but I have no clue to the solution, so please advise.

The most up-to-date instructions now live at: http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/OSX/Homebrew

This: https://github.com/wjwwood/ros-osx/tree/master/electric-lion-homebrew is currently the best approach at getting ROS working on Lion.  Many tools are still not working, so use at your own risk.  I would suggest a Ubuntu VM for now.

Have you followed the guide to date for OSX Lion?  It is currently very unstable, and would probably not make the best platform to learn on until it stabilizes a bit.

A:

This error probably means that rosbag has not been built properly.  The most likely cause of the error is because rosbag/bin/record does not exist.
