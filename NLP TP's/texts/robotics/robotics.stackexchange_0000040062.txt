Q:

RGBD-SLAM publish pointcloud Dropped 100.00% of messages

hi,i'm new to ros,
i was able to  run offline RGBD-SLAM package from a bag file,and it
work fine,but when i try to send the result point cloud to octomap_server
through pressing 'ctrl+M'.The saved bt file is alway be the size of 18k,and
only containing one node. Here is the log info I found
[WARN] MessageFilter [target=/map ]: Dropped 100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the [ros.octomap_server.message_notifier] rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more information.

the bag file i record is follow this command:
rosbag record -O filename-prefix /tf /camera/rgb/image_color /camera/rgb/camera_info /camera/depth/image /camera/depth/camera_info

anyway,if i do online rgbdslam, all is ok!
could anyone help me out?Any suggestion is appreciate!!

A:

My guess is that the timestamps of the /map -> /openni_camera transformation are set to ros::Time::now(). The transformations /openni_camera -> /openni_rgb_optical_frame from the bag file are old. Try running the static transformations launchfile for the kinect (roslaunch openni_camera kinect_frames.launch or something similar) before sending out the model but after you finished mapping with rgbdslam.
