Q:

Has groovy base install been shrinked from fuerte?

I've installed groovy on a pandaboard following this tutorial
Now I'm trying building the hokuyo node and I'm missing a LOT of dependencies:

sensor_msgs
geometry_msgs
diagnostic_msgs
diagnostic_updater
self_test
dynamic_reconfigure

And possibly more.
Now I have two problems with this:

Why do I have do manually download so many packages there were previously part of the base install?

Is there a way to automate package downloading and building? Isn't rosdep supposed to be the solution to this? why doesn't $ rosmake <package_name> --rosdep-install work anymore? (no such option)

I may also point out that groovy builds with catkin, why instructions for the hokuyo for example still point to rosmake so I'm doing a mix here, and I hope in the end it will work.
Edit: http://www.ros.org/wiki/dynamic_reconfigure/Releases doesn't exist. So I'm manually perusing the svn trying to find the package source.

Hi Claudio, does dynamic_reconfigure solved the hokuyo_node install issues? I have same issue for install hokuyo_node, but after i install dynamic_reconfigure, seems nothing change. i have no idea how it's work. can you point out what should i do on next step?

A:

The page you linked to tells you that there are more variants you can use with the wstool command, so that the pacakages you miss would be included (e.g. 'robot'). I have not tried this though, so maybe there are problems with that.
Find latest dynamic_reconfigure on github now, as many other ros packages:
https://github.com/ros/dynamic_reconfigure
The hokuyo_node package seems to still use rosbuild/rosmake, so to install this from source, you will need a rosbuild workspace in addition to the catkin workspace.

Most of the mentioned packages are available in the Mobile variant. Thanks KruseT.
