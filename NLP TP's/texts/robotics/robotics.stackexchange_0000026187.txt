Q:

BDI walking does not work in my PC

hi.
I tried BDI walking script, but it did not work.
Atlas failed to walk in simulation world.
Is it 'my' problem?
I want to know whether another user can success atlas BDI walking or not.
I did following process for testing.
drcsim version is 2.3.
1)start simulation
 $ roslaunch atlas_utils atlas.launch

2)run BDI walking scripts
 $ cd /usr/share/drcsim-2.3/ros/atlas_utils/scripts
 $ ./5steps.py

Then, atlas falls down.

If you reset the world/model pose, and then run 5steps.py again, it works (for me at least). Not that this is all that helpful, but if you just needed to collect some data...

A:

It's a known (and fixed) problem for the current drcsim_2.3 packages  http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/2274/atlas-failing-in-boston-dynamics-controller-demo/.
Immediate solution:
It was fixed in the drcsim 2.3 branch of drcsim repository. To have it working compile drcsim from source using the drcsim_2.3 branch.
Short term solution:
A short release cycle for this 2.3.1 version is planned which will ship this fix and can be installed using ubuntu packages.
