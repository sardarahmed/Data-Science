Q:

roslaunch problem

Hi,
When I use rosrun to begin a package, it works fine, but when I change to roslaunch it (it is a very simple launch file with only one node, and the package does not need any parameters), the package fails, the error information is: "process has died [pid 13287, exit code 255]." Nothing valuable is shown in the log file. Appreciation for any suggestions!

A:

roslaunch will add extra ROS arguments to the invocation of your node.  You should check to make sure that your node is capable of taking in these arguments.  Both roscpp and rospy come with libraries to filter these extra arguments out.

Thanks for your reply, but could you tell me which libs of roscpp I can use, or where could I get the related information?
