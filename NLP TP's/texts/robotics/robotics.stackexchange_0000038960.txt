Q:

Database for storing PCD files?

Hello all,
I am working on Robot Object Detection and Identification project.
I am using kinect camera, ROS and Point Cloud Library for that.
Well my questions are
1] Which kind of databases are more suited to store PCD files?
2] Do we have to interface ROS and PCL for processing of ICP algorithm.
thanks!

A:

Roboearth object recognition package is generating PCD files after recording the models and the user can upload this model to an online database provided by roboearth which is containing different object models.
I think you can use this database!
