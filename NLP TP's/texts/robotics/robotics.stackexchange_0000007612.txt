Q:

Raspberry Pi Hexapod 18DOF, Best servo control board?

Recently I've bought a hexapod kit and 18 TowerPro MG995 servos.
My objective is to apply also the Pi camera, sensors and perhaps a claw...
So I've been researching and I haven't found a clear answer when comes to the servo control board.
Which servo controller board shall I choose to complete my project?

A:

Servo's are controlled by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) so you need a PWM controller that has enough pins and power to drive Servos. I'd go with 2 of Adafruit's I2C-based controller but Pololu has a USB one that is rather popular.
