Q:

adding rgb data into a point cloud?

Hi, i'm currently working on a single line ladar which we've managed to transform into a point cloud via rviz so now i want to add some rgb data from a camera onto this point cloud.
assuming i have worked out which pixel to add to which point cloud point, is it possible to do this?
thanks
*edit:
im using pointcloud and not pointcloud2 at the moment

thanks for the answer, but we're currently using pointcloud 1, is it still possible to do this?

Yes, by using the channels, but I'd recommed switching to pointcoud2, if possible.

thanks, i'll do that in that case

A:

yes it is possible and quit common. Just check this link and you will find a description of the data type PointCloud2.
