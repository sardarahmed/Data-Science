A:

Look into the turtlebot package. In the turtlebot_description folder you can find the kinect.urdf.xacro file, look here to get started kinect.urdf.xacro. You can find the description of kinect inside with robot model for the turtlebot. You can ignore other parts as you only want the kinect description. Copy and paste the kinect description and use it for you new urdf file.  Start from the urdf tutorials and tf tutorialson ros wiki.
