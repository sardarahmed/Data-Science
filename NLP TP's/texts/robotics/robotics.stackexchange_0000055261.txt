A:

I'd say go for the XBOX360 Kinect, since it's widely used in the ROS community and some people report problems getting the Kinect for Windows to work with ROS.
PS: IMO the ASUS Xtion Pro Live is an even better choice, since it only requires an USB connection, is smaller and lighter and has the same performance as the Kinect. Unfortunately, it is usually a bit more expensive.

I included a link to the Q&A on how to get the Kinect for Windows to work with ROS in my answer. Seems like a bit of work to get it up and running.
