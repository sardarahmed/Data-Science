Q:

catkin_make do not create header files for srv files!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxVQnWhDgfg
I tried this tutorial. This tutorial is about creating srv files. I did everything like tutorial showed me. But in 4:14 tutorial says "you can verify your header files in devel/include" . For me this include file was not created.
I used catkin_make for compiling the workspace.
I did not understand problem. Anyone can help?

A:

For the headers of messages and services to be generated, the generate_messages macro needs to be invoked in CMake. It's currently commented out
As a side note, there is an official tutorial on the ROS wiki that will walk you through it with copy-n-paste able instructions.
