Q:

Node stops working

Hello,
I want to run a node of ROS.
When I tape the commande :
rosrun  ratslam_ros ratslam_Youness src/ratslam_ros/config/config_irataus.txt.in 

The node stops working. And in the log file I get the error :
[ WARN] [1486130761.721137111]: Reason given for shutdown: [new node registered with same name]

But the program still working
What should I do?

A:

The error tells you exactly what the problem is
new node registered with same name

This means that you already have another instance of that same node running. When you start another instance the names collide and ROS Master kills the node you're trying to run. If you want to use this node twice, consider using a launch file and giving each instance a unique name.
