Q:

Clearpath Husky A200 model in gazebo - wrong turnspeed?

Hello community!
I have a question concerning the clearpath husky A200 gazebo model. I set up a simulation for our husky in gazebo. After I got it running, I was able to control the husky model the same way as our "real" husky, running the same nodes in the simulation as on the real husky.
But there is a strange behaviour in gazebo during steering the model. It seems as if the steering/turning speed in gazebo is very slow compared to the "real" husky.
To get some numbers, I ran the "robot_pose_ekf" package to see some odometry data in rviz. When moving forward and backward on a strait line the data seems to be OK, but the turning speed is very different. For example, a 360° spot turn in gazebo are nearly 1080° in RVIZ regarding the odometry data.
Does anyone have some experience with this issue?
Regards
psei

Hello!
This maybe because the "real" husky is running in open loop mode while the simulated one is not. I can verify this but just so I understand the problem well. I am assuming the "real" husky has an IMU? So the 1080 degree you turn you saw in rviz is something you observed physically as well?

A:

A bugfix has been released to the ROS repo and should be available via apt-get in a week or so.
In the mean time, please check out https://github.com/husky/husky_simulator.git for the fixed version.
