Q:

Why is not building package turtlebot3_gazebo on ROS2?

I work with a turtlebot3 burger. In the instructions, when I install packages,
http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_setup/#pc-setup (16.1.4)
mkdir -p ~/turtlebot3_ws/src

cd ~/turtlebot3_ws

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/ros2/turtlebot3.repos

vcs import src < turtlebot3.repos

colcon build --symlink-install

the following error occurs:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_ros_pkgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_ros_pkgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_ros_pkgs"
  with any of the following names:

    gazebo_ros_pkgsConfig.cmake
    gazebo_ros_pkgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros_pkgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "gazebo_ros_pkgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "gazebo_ros_pkgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.

A:

That’s the classic “you didn’t install that package” error. Make sure to install it and/or run rosdep.
