Q:

How can I change the publishing rate of a node when the node is running?

I have a publisher and subscriber with a constant publishing rate. I want to change (increase or decrease) the publishing rate while the node is running ? I want to know if it is possible ?
thank you

A:

The short answer is, if you have access to the source code for your node, you can make it do whatever you want.
Most users use dynamic_reconfigure for changing parameters at run time. If you create a dynamic_reconfigure parameter for your publishing rate, you can use the dynamic reconfigure gui to change it while the node is running.
