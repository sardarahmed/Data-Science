Q:

Problem Installing ROS2

Hi,
I have just tried to install ROS2 but I have this error when I compile the ros2 bridge:
ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (PyInit__roslz4)
I am using the script:
src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py
Thank you.
Enrico

Seeing as this is really all experimental stuff, I think it would be better to report this at the main ros2 issue tracker.
