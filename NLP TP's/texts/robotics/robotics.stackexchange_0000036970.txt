Q:

Enable RSS feed for tags

Would be nice to get an RSS feed for an specific tag.
Tag pages showing lists of corresponding answers display an RSS button which always points to the "all answers" feed.
After checking the askbot site, their links to RSS feed in a tag page can generate this kind of tag feed via HTML param "?tags=". Probably is a question to update the whole askbot since theirs is in 0.7.32 and answers.ros.org 0.6.74.
Thanks.

I concur that this would be useful, at least until email notifications work properly.

A:

We will be upgrading the version of askbot which answers.ros.org runs soon.
