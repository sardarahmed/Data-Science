Q:

teleop_base deprecated, need generic teleop package

Hi All,
It looks like teleop_base is deprecated according to its manifest.
So my question is this: is pr2_teleop the new "generic" teleop package? If so, why the "pr2" prefix? I have a bunch of heterogeneous robots, whats the best "universal" teleop package? I need joystick and keyboard support at a minimum.

A:

There is now a github organization for generic teleop tools in ros: https://github.com/ros-teleop
For teleop using a keyboard, there is teleop_twist_keyboard
For teleop using a joystick there is a new package in ROS Indigo called teleop_twist_joy
