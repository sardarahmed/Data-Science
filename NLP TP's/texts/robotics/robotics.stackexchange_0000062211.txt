Q:

Is (Non RGB) Xtion Pro Supported?

Hi, I have an Xtion Pro Sensor (non 'Pro-Live' version, without RGB camera) and am trying to run:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

It dies immediately with with 'Service Call Failed!' errors.
I'm running Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04. Before I start delving into messing with parameters, wondering if anyone has managed to get the non-rgb Xtion Pro depth camera running with the openni_camera package? Or is it simply not supported?
(I also have a the Pro-Live RGB version of the sensor and it works fine on the same system)
EDIT:
The underlying problem was a symbol lookup error which I solved by updating my system.  Now I'm running openni2_launch and the camera is recognized, but I'm getting this error on launch:
[ERROR] [1409344784.275581907]: Unsupported color video mode - Resolution: 640x480@30Hz Format: RGB888

and this error when I add a PointCloud2 pointing to /camera/depth/points in Rviz:
[ INFO] [1409345247.761731749]: Starting depth stream.
[ INFO] [1409345248.232848173]: using default calibration URL

[ERROR] [1409345248.237372380]: Rectified topic '/camera/depth/image_rect_raw' requested but camera publishing '/camera/depth/camera_info' is uncalibrated

I can't find any easy parameter change fix in the openni2.launch file, do I actually have to calibrate the camera? My Xtion Pro Live RGBD camera gives the same calibration warnings but not the last error shown above

EDIT2:
Couldn't get non RGB Xtion Pro working under Xubuntu 12.04 and Hyrdo, I may have been running into this bug, as the error messages match exactly:
https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni2_camera/issues/14
But a fresh of install of Xubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo did the trick, openni2_launch just works, with default settings.

A:

There shouldn't be any issues using the Xtion Pro. Can you update your question with output from lsusb -v, and relevant parts of dmesg when you plug in the sensor, and when you start openni? Keep in mind that newer ASUS sensors work with openni2 packages instead of openni.

Thanks! You've answered my basic compatibility question but I'm now I'm getting a calibration error, please see update to the question

I've only ever used the live version, and never had that issue, so I can't help you there. You could try running the calibration yourself and see if that helps.

oh and try disabling the rgb_processing argument in openni2_launch, see if that gets rid of your error.

tried everything short of actually calibrating in xubuntu 12.04 + hydro, nothing worked. BUT SUCCESS! >> after a fresh install of xubuntu 14.04 and ROS indigo, openni2_launch just works!

short of upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 and Indigo (I am hoping to stay with Hydro on 12.04), has anyone found a solution?
