Q:

Error running "ign gazebo shapes.org" from tutorial

Ubuntu 22.04.
Iâ€™ve installed gazebo garden using Binary installation on Ubuntu instructions from this page: https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install_ubuntu
Then when I run the command "ign gazebo shapes.org" I get the following response:
"Command 'ign' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install ignition-tools".
After installation of "ignition-tools" I get the following error: "I cannot find any available 'ign' command:
* Did you install any ignition library?
* Did you set the IGN_CONFIG_PATH environment variable?
E.g.: export IGN_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/share/ignition"
I also tried to install "libignition-gazebo" from this page: https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/6.3/install.html - no luck.
What is this "ign" command, and how can I install it?

A:

If you're using Gazebo Garden. You should use the Garden version of the tutorials.
The ign gazebo command was deprecated in favor of gz sim
See: https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/migration_from_ignition for details on this migration.
TL;DR use gz sim shapes.sdf
