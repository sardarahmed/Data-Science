Q:

Installation failed, rodep: command not found

I tried to install ros-kinetic-desktop-full  on a ubuntu 16.4.
I run :
  $ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
  $ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
  $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

the terminal shows like this (part of it ):

After the process is finished , I run:
$ sudo rosdep init
sudo: rodep: command not found

It seems that ROS is not installed.
I tried to install rosdep agan using pip. It seems work.
I also tried to install rosdep using apt, the terminal shows:

After apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-base,  sudo rosdep init will cause rosdep import error. So
I reinstall rosdep using pip  according to #206533.
Thensudo rosdep init && rosdep update execute  can be executed normally.
But  when $ roscore,  ImportError: No module named defusedxml.xmlrpc
So according to #260377,  I reinstalled defusedxml.
but nothing changed.  Still defusedxml.xmlrpc  import error.

A:

It appears OP had multiple Python interpreters installed on his system, one of which located in /usr/local.
As that took precedence over the system-provided Python (ie: 2.7 on Ubuntu Xenial), and apt-distributed python-* packages are only installed in the default locations, including the many ROS Python packages and dependencies, various import statements failed with "No module named X".
Removing the interpreter from /usr/local was not sufficient, as there also seemed to be something wrong with the, still present, system Python 2.7 install.
Reinstallation using sudo apt install --reinstall python-minimal python2.7-minimal python2.7 python-pip seemed to have restored the system-provided Python installation to a state where things seem to have normalised sufficiently for things like rosdep and roscore to start working again.

(this is not directed at the OP)
In the end this appears to be another example of users (inadvertently) using a different Python interpreter (whether another 2.7.x version, Anaconda or something else) and expecting everything to just work (perhaps a justified expectation).
But as each interpreter has its own package/module search path, and apt distributed pkgs are only installed into whatever the Linux distribution maintainers consider the "default path", anything but the default Python interpreter will not be able to locate those packages, resulting in all sorts of problems such as experienced by the OP.
