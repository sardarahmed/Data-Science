Q:

catkin setup.sh overwrites PATH environment variable?

I am following the groovy installation and tutorial.
I source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash in my .bashrc.
I then set up catkin workspace and run catkin_make.
The resulting devel/setup.bash, when sourced, eliminates the /opt/ros/groovy/bin reference that was in my PATH environment variable... meaning I can not continue with the tutorial which is about rospack.
Should the catkin workspace setup.sh be overwriting the PATH environment variable like this? The catkin manual says it should respect already-sourced script like /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash, but it doesn't seem to be doing that.

A:

Ahhh... I figured out what I was doing wrong. I had initially gone deeper into the documentation (as suggested) here:
www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Overlays
The process it explains was causing my failure:
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ rosws init --catkin ~/catkin_ws/src /opt/ros/groovy
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ catkin_make
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
Even if I ensure /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash was installed previously.
To get back on track in the tutorial, I deleted the ~/catkin_ws directory, re-sourced /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash and just did the basic tutorial steps of:
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
