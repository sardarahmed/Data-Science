Q:

Prevent (via command line) a node from advertising topics

I am wondering if it is possible to prevent an existing node from advertising/publishing on a number of unnecessary topics.
In particular, p2os publishes on the following topics:
/sonar
/pose
/gripper_state
/motor_state
/aio
/ptz_state
/tf
/battery_state
/dio

I only care about /pose and /sonar, is there any way to tell the node not to broadcast  the other topics without rebuilding the node?

A:

No, not unless the node exposes parameters or something similar that allow to switch this.
The only thing you can do is redirect those topics to somewhere else, if they interfere with other publications on the same topic.
