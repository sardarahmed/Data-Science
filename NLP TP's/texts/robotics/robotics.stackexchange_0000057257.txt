Q:

Error while building catkin_ws in Ubuntu 13.10

Hi there,
I'm trying to install ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 13.10 from source and I get this error while builiding catkin_ws with rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y :
executing command [sudo apt-get install -y gazebo2]
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package gazebo2
ERROR: the following rosdeps failed to install
  apt: command [sudo apt-get install -y gazebo2] failed
  apt: Failed to detect successful installation of [gazebo2]

Can someone point me out how can I get pass this dependency? (that means, how to make rosdep ignore gazebo2 package)
Already tried rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro -y -r (to ignore minor errors) but no luck.
Thanks!

Hi all,
I experienced the same problem and fixed it by first launching:

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb
http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu
saucy main" >
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'
wget
http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key
-O - | sudo apt-key add

A:

To check all the dependecies without running into errors durign their installation try rosdep check instead of rosdep install. You can also use this info to manually install any additional dependencies that come "after" gazebo2 manually (e.g. with apt-get).
Edit: It is also possible to locally mark a dependecy as met by adding a local rosdep source file with an empty entry for that dependecy, see https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/issues/15.

I had the same issue, but lots of missing dependencies. This one made my life a bit easier:

rosdep check --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro hydro | grep apt | grep -v gazebo2 | awk '{print $2;}' | xargs sudo apt-get install -y

There is also the -s (simulate) flag for rosdep install, but I'm not sure if it would error if a deb package is not found.

And for completeness, I just found out that there is a way to locally mark dependencies as met.
