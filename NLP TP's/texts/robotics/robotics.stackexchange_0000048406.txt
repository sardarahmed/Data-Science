Q:

Problem with ROS Networking

Hello,
I have already tried this tutorial,
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Robots/TurtleBot/Network%20Setup
and everything was perfect, so I don't have a problem with Turtlebot networking setup.
Now I'm trying to follow this tutorial
http://nootrix.com/2012/06/ros-networking/
On my workstation, first I run
ssh name@turtlebot_lap

and when I run
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

I get this error
turtlesim_node: cannot connect to X server 

Any suggestions will be appreciated.
Thanks!

A:

I think that tutorial is not very clear. The turtlesim_node has to be run on the actual machine itself (ie in that tutorial, you have to run it on the r2d2 machine) and not through ssh. This is because turtlesim_node requires gui (X server) and you have to use "ssh -X name@turtlebot_lap" in order to see gui through ssh.
If you want to follow that tutorial, I would suggest using the r2d2 machine, open a terminal to ssh into c3po, and run roscore. Then, open a new terminal (this will be the r2d2 terminal) and run turtlesim_node.
Following the tutorial here would be easier.
