Q:

is there any benchmarks for comparing the methods of visual slam

I have studied the matlab code of Javier Civera's 1-point RANSAC for EKF MonoSLAM, but I find I am lack of some datasets to evaluate the visual slam system, because I don't have the powerful robot to collect good data sets.
does any one know some image dataset to test the visual SLAM methods ? or else, tell me some good simulator  to implement the visual SLAM methods and finally evaluate the methods

A:

There is a dataset designed to "establish a novel benchmark for the evaluation of visual odometry and visual SLAM systems" by JÃ¼rgen Sturm at TUM:

Hope that helps...

Here's also the paper about that dataset: https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fvision.in.tum.de%2F_media%2Fspezial%2Fbib%2Fendres12icra.pdf&ei=VAf9UK6QIcSAtAaS_4G4Bg&usg=AFQjCNEJgauHEKqNQbiPCgkcVbNY3TisjQ&sig2=iamLPUhgTUA8yloNx8Oeag&bv
