Q:

How to let ar_track_alvar only detect certain tags

Hi,
So, I'm running ar_track_alvar (the groovy branch) to detect ar tags. It all went well except sometimes it detects something that's not a tag as a tag 154 or some other tag that is way off from like that, So I'm wondering if there is some way I can do to let it only detects the tag that I want it to detect?

A:

I suggest that you just filter the tags after it detects them and republish the filtered set removing any detections that are known out of the scope of the expected tags.
