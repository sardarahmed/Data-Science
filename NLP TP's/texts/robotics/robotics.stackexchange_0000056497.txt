Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROSCON 2014

Are there any proposed dates, venues or location for this year ?
I have found it useful to ask for sponsors grants and contributions 6-12 months before an event.
In addition, it takes some planning for people to attend )
Cheers Everyone

it will be in HongKong.
a professor in my university is the ROSCON 2014 cooperator, I heard him talking about this last month.  <--- treat my words just like a rumor please

This kind of question (and following discussion) would probably be best suited for the ROS users mailing list?

Random guess: If it's rumored to be in Hong Kong it might be attached to ICRA.

I am on far too many mailing lists and not on this ros one so far..
One must be careful about rules in an Opens Source effort, it can cause big adoption problems>
Cloudstack and Citirx made this mistake

Edit: ROSKong 2014 has been announced for June 6th in Hong Kong in conjunction with ICRA.  Full information is available at https://events.osrfoundation.org/ros-kong-2014/
ROSCon 2014 is expected to take place in October near IROS in Chicago.

any chance of intermediary events, besides something each year ?  I am sure they happen )
I will follow the blog and here, I get thousands of email a week across several emails
btw- some rumor can be effective in promoting the org.  It can be constructive.  it is what I learned at Omidyar

I never got an answer to email asking if ROS needs sponsorship from SoftLayer or other resources

@uaflyer I haven't seen your email. Please contact me directly about sponsorship. My email is listed at http://wiki.ros.org/TullyFoote on the wiki
