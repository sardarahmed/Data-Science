Q:

Simple local planner in Python?

Hello everybody,
I would like to implement my own local planner using Python for exercise purposes. Therefore, I make no use of move_base and the ROS navigation stack at all and try to implement those parts (localization, global planner, local planner) in Python. Since algorithms like dwa or teb seem pretty advance to me and I am not too experienced in robotics and Python my question is the following: Is there any local planning algorithm in existence that is feasible to implement for beginners? Any 'light weight' versions of the local planners implemented in the ROS navigation stack?
Thanks in advance!

A:

An excellent resource to consider is Python Robotics: https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/tree/master/PathPlanning
Under Path Planning there are many examples. The examples are as simple as possible primarily in 2D but you can use them as a foundation.
