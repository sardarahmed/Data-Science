Q:

Extract laser scan from a map and known location

If we have the map of an environment (an occupancy grid for instance) and precisely know the pose of the robot within it. How can one reconstruct what the laser scan should look like at a given location ?

A:

You can do it manually with a protractor and straight edge - put the center of your protractor on the scanner center, align your protractor's zero-angle mark to the scanner zero, then mark off ticks at whatever your scanner resolution is.
Then you use the straight edge to connect the dots from the center, through each tick, until either you draw to an object or you reach the max range of the laser scanner.
In software, you can simulate this by "ray casting" from the scanner center along each scan angle.
