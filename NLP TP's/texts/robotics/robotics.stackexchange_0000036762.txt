Q:

Tutorial: Understanding a Topic: run rxgraph I got a nameError

Hi all,
I am following the ROS tutorial and now come to the Understanding ROS Topics. When I key in rxgraph, it give me
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/btian/ros/ros/bin/rxgraph", line 36, in 
rxgraph.rxgraph_main()
File "/home/btian/ros/rx/rxgraph/src/rxgraph/init.py", line 61, in rxgraph_main
print >> sys.stderr, "Graphviz does not appear to be installed on your system. Please run:\n\n\trosdep install rosgraph\n\nto install the necessary dependencies on your system"
NameError: global name 'sys' is not defined
But \n\n\trosdep does not exist. I tried import sys also, does not help.
any idea how to get over this?
