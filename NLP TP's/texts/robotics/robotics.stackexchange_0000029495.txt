A:

These are the best ways to get karma:

+10 for your answer or question being upvoted
+15 for your answer being selected
+2  for accepting an answer to your question

So ask questions, and answer others.

@Gazer You can always ask questions and answer questions. Until you've gained a few points there are spam prevention measures in place with respect to links etc.

How many points do you need to be able to post a question?

But new posts by new users will be held for moderation, and will not show up until a moderator approves them (this is an important anti-spam measure).
