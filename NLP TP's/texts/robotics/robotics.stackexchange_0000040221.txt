Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: markers python

Hi!
I need to add in rviz a marker from a python code. The thing is that I have a ekf map based localization written in python and it is using matplotlib, but I want to plot everithing on rviz, so I need to use markers. All the turtorials I've found are in cpp, but I am obviously not going to change all the code from python to cpp for this.
Where can I find something on python and markers?
Thanks!

A:

Marker messages are ROS messages just like anything else you can publish from a python node, there's nothing special about them. You can find an example in this question/answer.
