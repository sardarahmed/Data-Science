Q:

How do you use jpeg_streamer

Sorry, but I ran jpeg_streamer and another node that publishes a compressed image but now what do I do? Tried to connect a web browser to localhost:8080 but nothing happened. Expected to see my camera image sent as an jpeg stream.

A:

Ok I figured it out ... run:
rosrun jpeg_streamer jpeg_streamer image:=image_raw/compressed

Then go to localhost:8080 in your web browser.

That's not valid syntax... Params should be prefixed by an underscore. That said, neither syntax works for me. It just hangs indefinitely and outputs no status.
