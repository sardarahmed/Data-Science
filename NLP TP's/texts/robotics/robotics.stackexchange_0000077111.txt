Q:

how to make the map thicker? (gmaping params)

I'm using the gmapping/slam_gmapping  node to create the map using ros_arduino_bridge and neato_laser_driver with those the /odom , /scan, and /tf can be published.
I referred the parameter configuration of rbx1: here and I found that:

the map is drawn lightly.
there are many emissive lines which is not as the reality and should be get rid of.

Can you guys tell me which parameter of slam_gmapping influences these features?
Thank You Very Much!!
ps: I'm using the ros-indigo and neato_xv11 laser scanner. THX!!

The map did not get denser even I stay the robot at some position for 1 hour.

A:

The emissive lines typically come from laser scanner max range measurements. Some laser scanners map scan errors to max range as well, which could lead to this problem. I haven't worked with the neato myself, so I cannot tell if this is the problem here.
Also, typically, you don't update the map if you don't move the robot. gmapping has three parameters when to trigger an update:

linearUpdate
angularUpdate
temporalUpdate

If you want to update also why standing still, you should set temporalUpdate to something else then -1.0 (default), which disables temporal updates.

thx mig! I think this problem may be not as so simple. If the map scan errors caused the emissive lines, there should be some black points appears at the end of the emissive lines, more or less. Neverthless, there is no black poit at all.
