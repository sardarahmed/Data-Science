Can you be more specific please ? How an information like "Faculty Office" would be used by a program ? Do you mean something like if you give some coordinates you could get the name of the location pointed to ? That would require some post-processing to manually identify each location.

I don't have examples or any procedure to follow but what you are looking for is called image segmentation (maybe even semantic SLAM). I believe OpenCV may have algorithms able to do this.

Hi john_vector. What i have come to understand is that you want to create a map which would serve the purpose of showing different locations on it. So i came through this link(below) which is doing similar thing. Hope it helps :D
