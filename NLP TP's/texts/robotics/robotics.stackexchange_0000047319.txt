Yes definitely you can run on atom boards.

A:

You can run it on a pc or mac. Generally when a development board can run Ubuntu it is possible to run ROS on it (with some effort). If you want to do some I/o than you need extra hardware. But you should research yourself some more not everything will be explained here..
