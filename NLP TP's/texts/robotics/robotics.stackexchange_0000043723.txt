Q:

gazebo.hh not found

Hi, I'm currently trying to do this tutorial
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/tutorials/plugins/simple_world
but at when I compile the code,
'cmake' works fine but
'make' produces the following error
/home/u0905937/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/hello_world.cc:1:21: fatal error: gazebo.hh: No such file or directory

I did a locate and found gazebo.hh in
/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/simulator_gazebo/gazebo/gazebo/include/gazebo-1.0.2/gazebo/gazebo.hh

Does the problem has anything to do with my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or ROS_WORKSPACE?
I've tried adding the above location to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH but to no avail. My ROS_WORKSPACE is /home/u0905937/fuerte_workspace if that is any help.
I'm running on Ubuntu 12.04
EDIT: Thanks Kai, I've tried using the rosmake method and at least it could partially build the package.
But I still face the problem of the computer not being able to find gazebo.hh. I've tried copying gazebo.hh into /usr/include/ but it came up with a new error of not being able to find the next header which is gazebo_core.hh. So I copy and pasted it again which brought up another new error of not being able to find the next header the previous one referred to. There's got to be an easier way right?
By the way, my system is downgraded to ubuntu 11.10.

A:

In ROS, you can give this tutorial a try.
Alternatively, give the following prefix to your cmake command:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=`rospack find gazebo`/gazebo/lib/pkgconfig cmake ..

and things should build correctly.

Okay thanks. It tried on ubuntu 12.04 and your tutorial works perfectly fine.

Where in CMakelists.txt, I should I add it?
