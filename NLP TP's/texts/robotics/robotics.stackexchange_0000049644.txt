Q:

Git: driver cloning doesn't work

Hi,
I want to clone the driver "sick_tim3xx" for the Sick Laserscanner from the following URL:
   kos.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/sick_tim3xx.git

Unfortunately I get always the error, that the HTTP request failed. Is there another way to install this driver?

A:

It seems they have been removed all the projects from their git server (or maybe they are doing maintenance tasks). You can check this here: link text where a 404 error is displayed saying: No projects found.
I recommend that you contact them directly through its website: link text
