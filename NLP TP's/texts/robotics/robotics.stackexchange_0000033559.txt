A:

he sam
when you run the command

sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-*

you try to install every single package/stack available this way. this is way more than just normal diamondback.
install instructions for diamondback can be found here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation
about those dependencies, have you tried installing the dependencies with apt-get install, when i check it shows them as available (you might have to do an apt-get update)

Thank you~The message is changed to english version successfully. I have updated the original post to english version of output messages.
Comment by dornhege on 2011-08-13:
For me LC_MESSAGE=en_US.UTF8 works. But this only gives english messages, which would be easier than translating. To solve the actual problem try the suggestion by Bram an post errors from that in english.
Comment by sam on 2011-08-13:
I can run export LANG=en_US , but when I run export LC_MESSAGES=en_US, it shows that bash: warning: setlocale: LC_MESSAGES: cannot change locale (en_US): No such file or directory. What can I do next? Thank you~
Comment by dornhege on 2011-08-12:
In that case a translation is probably better ;) You can try export LANG=en_US and export LC_MESSAGES=en_US in the console you run the install from. In any way, can you give the information requested by tfoote and try the suggestion by Bram.
Comment by sam on 2011-08-12:
I know typing is not the best way,but my output is chinese,I have tried to change it to english version,but not works. So I try to translate the original message to english version. I have successfully installed ROS by that command before,but now it would not work. I don't know why.Thank you~
Comment by dornhege on 2011-08-10:
I guess, the manual installation should lead to another error. When that happens, update the original post with those erros and the commands issued and always copy&paste the exact error messages instead of typing.
