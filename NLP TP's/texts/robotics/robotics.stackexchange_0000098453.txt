Q:

Example of using image_proc/resize in ROS2 Foxy

Hello all.
I have not been able to find an example of using image_proc/resize in ROS2 Foxy.
Can someone give me a usage example from the command line?
Best regards.

A:

I was confused by this as well. The answer appears in the CMake file: https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/blob/ros2/image_proc/CMakeLists.txt
Summary:
The image_proc executable contains 2 nodes: RectifyNode and DebayerNode. Example usage:
ros2 run image_proc image_proc

You can use various --ros-args to remap topics as needed.
To use ResizeNode you will need to write a launch file. This example might be helpful: https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/blob/ros2/image_proc/launch/image_proc.launch.py
