Q:

RViz: ros package using_markers not found

Hi everyone,
I tried to follow tutorials for rviz in http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes
However, after I did it step by step, ros cannot find the package even though I have sourced setup.bash. Can someone help me out? Great thanks!!!

A:

The problem is that
z1huo@z1huo-ThinkPad-P51:~$ catkin_create_pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs

was executed from your home directory rather than in the source space (src directory) of your workspace. Therefore, it can't be found by catkin_make. It's easy to miss (and misunderstand), but in the tutorial that you linked to it tells you (my emphasis added)

Before getting started, let's create a package called using_markers, somewhere in your package path:
catkin_create_pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs

This basically means to run that command from the src directory of a catkin workspace. Now, try the same command, but from your src directory just as follows
z1huo@z1huo-ThinkPad-P51:~/catkin_ws/src$ catkin_create_pkg using_markers roscpp visualization_msgs

These are pretty basic concepts (that you need to put packages in the src directory and compile from the root of your workspace), so I suggest that you go through the tutorials on the wiki until these concepts are really driven in.

Make sure to use the advice that @gvdhoorn gave you in one of your previous questions (#q292904) which is basically what I've outlined here. (As a side note, you should also accept that answer as it tells you how to solve your issue.)
