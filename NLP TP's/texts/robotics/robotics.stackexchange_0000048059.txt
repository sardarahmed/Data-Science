Q:

ROSjava VisualizationView

Hi,
have anybody working example of VisualizationView, because the tutorial map_viewer doesn't work. Now I try use VisualizationView for display map and laser scan, but I am not yet successful. In RViz is all working well, and communication should by OK, in rxgraph are all arrows right connected.
My code:

VisualPanel = (VisualizationView) findViewById(R.id.visualization);
...
CameraControlLayer cameraControlLayer =  new CameraControlLayer(this, nodeMainExecutor.getScheduledExecutorService());
VisualPanel.addLayer(cameraControlLayer);
OccupancyGridLayer Map = new OccupancyGridLayer("map");
VisualPanel.addLayer(Map);
VisualPanel.addLayer(new LaserScanLayer("scan"));
...
nodeMainExecutor.execute(VisualPanel, nodeConfiguration.setNodeName("android/map_view")

Thanks for any advice

A:

The visualization view works successfully on some of my android devices, but not on my tablet, Nexus7.(I should say that I rewrote the source code a little to use OccupancyGridLayer as you did.)
I don't know the reason, but you should try your application on another kind of android.
In addition, I wonder if you set the camera frame to a right position by using VisualizationView.getCamera().jumpToFrame() method.
