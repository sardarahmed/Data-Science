Q:

sudo：rosdep: command not found

Hi, everyone!
I'm installing ROS indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and following the instructions on this website: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
After step 1.4, I run $ sudo rosdep init, it says "sudo: rosdep: command not found". I think I've downloaded python-rosdep pack.
Here's what I did:
~$ locate rosdep
/var/cache/apt/archives/python-rosdep_0.11.4-1_all.deb

~$ cd /var/cache/apt/archives
    /var/cache/apt/archives$ sudo rosdep init
sudo：rosdep: command not found

Did I miss any step? Or did I do something wrong?
Thanks! Any help will be appreciated.

A:

How you installed rosdep is the question. Did you follow http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep#Installing_rosdep that says using apt-get?
~$ locate rosdep
/var/cache/apt/archives/python-rosdep_0.11.4-1_all.deb

That just means you somehow downloaded an installer and doesn't necessarily mean it's installed.
