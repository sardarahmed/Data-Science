Q:

rostest error: Test Fixture Nodes failed to launch

Hello. I am a newbie on ROS.
I tried to test some codes with rostest, but error occured.
Would you give me some clues to fix it?
Thank you.
The error message is:

It looks like there's an error in your test file. Please edit your question to include your check1.test file.

I got the Test Fixture Nodes error I think because the nodes were from a package not installed on the system (jenkins CI), adding their package to <test_depend> appeared to fix it.
(It seems to be the general rule with automated tests in cloud CI that useful error messages are put somewhere inaccessible like a log file that the user can't access, you can't ssh into CI runner to view them, or in the best case are somewhere in the middle of thousands of lines of CI console output...)

A:

Yes, I didn't have authority of test files. I solve the problem with chmod -x . I appreciate for your concern.

Do you mean chmod +x? -x removes the permission to execute, but it sounds like you needed to add it.
