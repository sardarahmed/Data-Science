Q:

sbpl_lattice_planner on Fuerte

Hi all
I'm trying to compile the sbpl_lattice_planner package from the navigation_experimental Stack, i have installed all the dependencies but the compilation fails.
After checking the log of the compilation it seems that it could not found the sbpl/headers.h header file
Here is a part of the build_output.log,

Any ideas?

A:

Hi all
I was able to find the error, it was a matter of the include directories for the sbpl_lattice_planner. I search for the "headers.h" file using the command

$sudo find /opt/ros/ -name "headers.h"

and get as the result:

/opt/ros/fuerte/include/sbpl/sbpl/headers.h

so it seems that this path was not correctly established on the CMakeList.txt file, so i add it to the include directories, just adding this line to the file

include_directories(/opt/ros/fuerte/include/sbpl)

then rebuild the package and now seems to work fine
Regards
Mario

was sbpl included as dependency for sbpl_lattice_planner in manifest.xml?? If yes, manual inclusion for sbpl header directory is not required!
Comment by AHornung on 2012-06-25:
The problem (that I also ran into) is that find_package(sbpl) returns "/opt/ros/fuerte/include/" as include path, which requires all includes to be changed from "sbpl/headers.h" into "sbpl/sbpl/headers.h".
