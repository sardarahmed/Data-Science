Q:

How to install packages as subdirectory of metapackage?

So, currently I have packages that install their binaries to catkin_ws/install/lib/package_name
I made a metapackage to contain these directories. Now I would like them to install like this: install/lib/meta_package_name/package_name
Is there any good way of achieving this?

A:

Unless I misunderstand you, metapackages don't work that way (they are not stacks). They are essentially a way to group a number of packages and make them easily installable by only installing the metapackage. Dependency resolution then pulls in the others.
In the original design, metapackages didn't even have a CMakeLists.txt.
Do you have any specific reason for such a directory layout?

well my source is laid out like this: /src/group_of_files/many_individual_package_folders.
I was hoping that my install could look the same way ie: install/lib/group_of_files_/my_packages
I think this is mostly just for convenience and easily identifying package install locations.

i guess its not necessary, but it would be nice. So did stacks used to work this way (sorry im new to catkin/ros)? If so, why did they change it for metapackages? I guess the only point of a metapackage is just to install easier?

If you really want to know, take a look at the rationale behind the move to catkin (FHS compliance, etc). Stacks did not put everything in install/lib, but they did contain all packages.
As to 'being nice': you typically do things like $(find PKGNAME), so does it matter where things are?

ok, thanks for the answer. I guess it doesn't really matter... its just... annoying lol
