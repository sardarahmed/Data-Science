Comment by autonomy on 2013-03-25:
octomap_msgs/OctomapBinary.h: No such file or directory <-- does this file actually exist in that directory? Is the casing correct? (it's not octomapbinary.h, is it?).
Comment by AHornung on 2013-03-25:
Which ROS version are you using?
Comment by FfoNy on 2013-03-25:
ROS version is 1.9.42

A:

Is there a reason you install octomap_mapping from source, and not the binary packages?
You can install them pre-compiled with all dependencies by running sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-octomap-mapping (fuerte) or sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-octomap-mapping (groovy).
It seems to me that you are either missing a dependency (octomap_msgs) in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, or mixing different ROS versions. OctomapBinary.h only exists for fuerte.
If you need a source compile, then you also need to manually download and compile the dependencies, most notably the packages octomap_ros and octomap_msgs. Fuerte versions are at http://alufr-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/octomap_stacks/ and
Groovy versions here:
https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap_msgs
https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap_ros
