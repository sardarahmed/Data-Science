Q:

I cannot get teleop_base

I am not sure why but I cannot checkout teleop_base. Please let me know if I miss anything. Is there another way to get it?
ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~/Documents/WorkSpaceROS$ svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/sandbox/teleop_base teleop_base

A:

That server has long since been taken off-line.
There appears to be a copy at Hudhaifa/teleop_base, but looking at teleop_base deprecated, need generic teleop package here on ROS Answers, the packages in github.com/ros-teleop are intended to replace teleop_base.

I will tried this tonight after work.
Can you tell me specific command I should use to get the package from git? Is it
git clone -b indigo-devel https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard

Then call catkin_make first before I can run it?
Thank you

There is no indigo-devel branch in teleop_twist_keyboard, and I would recommend installing the released version (sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-teleop-twist-keyboard), but if you must use sources, then be sure to run a rosdep check --from-paths .. --ignore-src .. etc.
