Q:

RViz not loading configuration or display area

I am using ros indigo on ubuntu 14.04. When I launch RViz, I get no errors, but I get a screen like this, regardless of my configuration file

I get a grey box instead of the normal viewing window. I can add panels, but the display/visualization window does not seem to work at all. If I try to open a configuration, it just goes back to this screen.
RViz has always worked on my computer until today. I was installing openCV from source recently, which required some massaging of packages, which I assume is causing this problem somehow. I already tried sudo apt-get install --reinstall ros-indigo-rviz

Thanks for the quick response; that is the same issue. Although not a lot of great solutions :/

Have you tried to install rviz from source?
