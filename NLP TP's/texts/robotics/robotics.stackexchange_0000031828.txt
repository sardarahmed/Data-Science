Q:

ROS topic communication between robots?

If I understand how ROS topics work, then communication between two robots running ROS via topics should be relatively straightforward.  Am I correct, and if so can you point me to a helpful resource on the matter?

I asked a very similar question here:

Essentially, there is no "official", comprehensive solution to this problem available so far, but there are some packages available that might (or might not) solve your problem.
