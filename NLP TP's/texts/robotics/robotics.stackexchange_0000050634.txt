Q:

Unable to locate package ros-groovy-executive-smach-tutorials

I have installed groovy on Ubuntu-12.10 Quantal following standard ROS instructions.
I could install executive_smach stack but when I try to install executive_smach_tutorials doing... .
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-executive-smach-tutorials
...I receive this error:
Unable to locate package ros-groovy-executive-smach-tutorials
What it works:
roscd smach
roscd smach_ros
What it doesn't
roscd smach_tutorials
Please if you could help me on how to include the repository where smach_tutorials is inside ROS tree I would really appreciate.
(I have tried using rosinstall including URI of code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/executive_smach_tutorials on /opt/ros/groovy/.rosinstall
etc... It doesn't work :( )
Thank you very much in advance

A:

The smach tutorials stack can be found here: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/browser/stacks/executive_smach_tutorials/trunk?rev=40356
I'll migrate it to github soon.
