Q:

Navigation Stack with gmapping

Has anyone had success getting the navigation stack to work with the gmapping package? If I understand it correctly, it appears that you could stop using the map_server and amcl, replace those with gmapping, and you could then perform autonomous mobility in an environment while you SLAM. Is that understanding correct? Do the local_costmap and global_costmap support this idea, and if so, what are the key parameters to configure this to happen?

A:

I was able to get this to work by not running both amcl and map_server, and running gmapping. The only parameter that I had to change (from the defaults in the navigation tutorial) were to change the global_costmap to NOT have a static map (static_map: false) and to set the rolling_window to true (rolling_window: true) in the global_costmap_params.yaml file.

I think this is a wrong guideline. Even though it can work, the navigation stack will never receive the updated map. The static map should be set to true and the rolling window should be set to false.

I tried to do as you said. I tried to set the goal point in rviz in unknown space and the robot wouldn't go there. Do I have to change some parameter in base_planer like global_base_planner and local_base_planner?
