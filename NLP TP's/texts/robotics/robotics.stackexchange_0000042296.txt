Q:

Source installation of Fuerte but pcl dependency problem

Hi.
I'm installing ROS Fuerte by source intallation.
I have followed below tutorial
http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu/Source
However, there are two problems.
First is following. It seems pcl dependency problem.
hyon@hyon-gt683dx:~/ros/visualization/rviz$ rosdep install -a
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved

ROS path [40]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [41]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [42]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
So I have installed PCL by doing followings
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:v-launchpad-jochen-sprickerhof-de/pcl
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpcl-all
Also there is a problem when I'm doing rosmake.
[rospack] Error: package/stack costmap_2d depends on non-existent package pcl
It also seems pcl problem.
Do you have some advice?

A:

In Fuerte, PCL will be treated as standalone library, not as a package of ROS. From http://ros.org/wiki/fuerte, Section 4- Migration :
pcl: should now be used as a standard system dependency, which means you must update your CMakeLists.txt to link against them directly and add include directories as appropriate.

You had already install pcl, you shall update CMakeLists.txt to reflect include directories and link directories

No. I have a problem during install a ROS in my machine. Not a migration.

answer is still valid.

Is your problem resolved?

I am having the same problem. As far as I can tell this looks like it is some problem with rosdep. I am just following the Ubuntu Source Install instructions directly as posted.
