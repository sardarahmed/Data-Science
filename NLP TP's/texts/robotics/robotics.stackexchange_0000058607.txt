Q:

Hi
The stable version release of Eigen3 library in Ubuntu 12.04 is version 3.0.5. I am trying to upgrade eigen3 to atleast version 3.2.1. It is required for compilation of hierarchical branch of g2o lib.
any suggestion how this can be solved.

Hi Nitin,
Yes you are correct, Ubuntu 12.04 stable uses Eigen 3.0.X. You can do any of the following;

Clone eigen repo or download source and compile and install it on your machine
Upgrade to 3.2 from the following deb provided by the yade crew - http://packages.yade-dem.org/precise/libeigen3-dev_3.2.1-1~precise1_all.deb
Upgrade to Ubuntu 12.10 or the latest stable Ubuntu 14.04 ( not really recommended until ROS indigo is fully stable on 14.04 )

Mrinal Kalakrishnan's STOMP libraries also require at least eigen 3.1. He got around the issue by catkinising eigen here https://github.com/kalakris/eigen. Though I wouldn't necessarily recommend that.
Hope this helps,
Jeremy

I am just wondering whether will upgrading the Eigen break other packages? May be because of API issue!
