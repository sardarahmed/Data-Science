Q:

Gazebo complains about default_robot_hw_sim in hydro

Gazebo complains about default_robot_hw_sim in hydro. BTW if I run the script that is mentioned it runs says successful but still get the same error.
[ INFO] [1383162826.470781248]: pluginlib WARNING: In file /tmp/buildd/ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control-2.3.3-0raring-20131021-0406/src/default_robot_hw_sim.cpp PLUGINLIB_DECLARE_CLASS is deprecated, please use PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS instead. You can run the script 'plugin_macro_update' provided with pluginlib in your package source folder to automatically and recursively update legacy macros.
