Q:

Rosdep fails and blocks the shell

Hi all,
I have some troubles with rosdep under Osx Lion.
It is not able to find the dependencies I need...some examples are eigen and tinyxml.
In installed both of them through macport (I prefer to use it instead of Homebrew) and I modified my .profile in this way:
export CPATH=/opt/local/include:/usr/local/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:/usr/local/lib
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/local/lib:/opt/local/Library/Frameworks:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib/

Furthermore when I execute
rosdep -install geometry

it blocks my shell and I have to reset it for being able to prompt commands again. Sometimes this problems also leaves a running process, called tclsh8.5 which uses a lot of CPU.
How can I fix it?

@tfoote actually it fixed the problem of the process, but not the one of the dependencies. Thanks!
