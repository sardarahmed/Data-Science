Q:

Is there a way to add pipes in Roslaunch files?

So in order to get more information out of GMapping, I had to write a simple publisher to publish what I wanted after I piped it in. My question now is can you add pipes to a Roslaunch file, so that way instead of having to type
roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch | rosrun scan publisher.py
I can just add it to an xml file?

...why not just add the publisher to the GMapping node?

Oh, I was having difficulty finding what I wanted in the code, since the Gmapping node is really just a wrapper. It is possible.

A:

roslaunch does have a launch-prefix option for nodes. Although it is a prefix, not postfix, you might be able to come up with something like a bash script that automatically pipes.
