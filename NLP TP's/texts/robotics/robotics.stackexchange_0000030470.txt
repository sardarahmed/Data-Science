Q:

Administrating the logging directory

How can you administrate usage of the ros logging dir (~/.ros/log)?
At the moment I suspect its only possible via the warning that roscore gives you on startup and use of rosclean. Is there an automated means of management?
Solution
Cannot set a maximum on the logging space, but as GeniusGeeko mentions below, you can wipe old logs fairly effectively using simple *nix magic. Put the following line in your user .bashrc:
find ~/.ros/log/* -mtime +5 -exec rm -rf {} \;

This will clean out any logs older than 5 days old. Alternatively you can put it in your system startup script (on ubuntu /etc/rc.local), just remember to convert the "~" to an explicit folder name pointing to your logs.

How often would you like to "rosclean" your logs?

A:

Just to do this..
echo "find ~/.ros/log/* -mtime +5 -exec rm -r {} \;" >> ~/.bashrc
Replace the 5 with how many days you want to remove that was created before that number. This will remove files older than 5 days old.
It will search for old files every time you open a terminal.

Good idea using find. I probably would not add it to my ~/.bashrc, but that would make a nice alias.
