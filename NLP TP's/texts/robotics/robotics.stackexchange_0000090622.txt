Q:

how to add newly created pkg path

I have just build the redox package from this page. Now how do i link the headers and libraries in ros cmakelist.txt file?
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6 FATAL_ERROR)

project(pcl_visualizer_viewports)

find_package(PCL 1.2 REQUIRED)

include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS} /home/rob/redox/include/)
link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})

add_executable (pcl_visualizer_demo pcl_visualizer_demo.cpp)
target_link_libraries (pcl_visualizer_demo ${PCL_LIBRARIES} /home/rob/redox/build/)

the error comming is:
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/pcl_visualizer_demo.dir/pcl_visualizer_demo.cpp.o: undefined reference to symbol 'redisAsyncHandleWrite'
//usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhiredis.so.0.13: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
CMakeFiles/pcl_visualizer_demo.dir/build.make:367: recipe for target 'pcl_visualizer_demo' failed

A:

This is no different from any other system dependency. Please see whether the Catkin documentation on system dependencies is clear enough.
