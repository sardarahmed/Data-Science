Q:

How to view old .vcg file in RVIZ?

Hi, all, I found some old ROS packages(written in fuerte or even older version of ROS)  where the outdated .vcg files are used to view the status of robot. I think it is very helpful to understand these packages if I can open these .vcg files in RVIZ.
Can someone tell me how to get it?
Thank youÔºÅ

I think a vcg-rviz conversion tool doesn't exist (yet?)

A:

There is no conversion tool for these old rviz files.
The ticket for creating a conversion tool was closed because Fuerte is no longer supported: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/656 . I suspect it would take a good developer 4-8 hours to write such a tool, but no one has needed it that badly.
I've generally had an older version of ROS installed somewhere, so I usually just open the old config in the old version of rviz and recreate it in the new version of rviz.
