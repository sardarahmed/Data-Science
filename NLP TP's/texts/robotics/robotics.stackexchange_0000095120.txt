This isn't a ROS question...
but: https://support.stereolabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/207776845-Can-I-use-the-ZED-without-CUDA-
You cannot use the ZED SDK (for which all ROS wrapped drivers will use) without a GPU. It is a strict requirement.

i dont want to use ZED SDK, i am asking for alternative ROS package by which i can get right and left camera unrectified images to use these topics with my own algorithm.

Doesn't the page which @stevemacenski links already explain how to do that?

The ZED camera is UVC (Universal Video Class) compliant so you can capture the left and right video streams of the ZED on Windows, Linux and even OSX without the ZED SDK.
