Q:

rosserial incompatable with Ardupilot?

I'm trying to add ros support to the Ardupilot board using rosserial but I am unable to include the ros.h header from rosserial_arduino without getting weird compilation errors:

libraries/ros_lib/ros/../rosserial_msgs/Log.h:17: error: expected identifier before numeric constant
libraries/ros_lib/ros/../rosserial_msgs/Log.h:17: error: expected `}' before numeric constant
libraries/ros_lib/ros/../rosserial_msgs/Log.h:17: error: expected unqualified-id before numeric constant
libraries/ros_lib/ros/../rosserial_msgs/Log.h:23: error: virtual outside class declaration

I'm able to compile and run rosserial examples on my Arduino just fine.
The Ardupilot code can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/

Hi Patrick.
I am unfamiliar with ardupilot, however it shouldnt give you errors like that.  If you provide a self contained example of where you are getting the error, I can help.
