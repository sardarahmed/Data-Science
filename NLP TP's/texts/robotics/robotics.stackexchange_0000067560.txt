Q:

Multi robot collision avoidance

I found a package for ROS which solves the multi robot collision avoidance problem:
http://wiki.ros.org/multi_robot_collision_avoidance
The instructions seem so simple, but yet something is missing in them.
I try to follow them in different versions of ROS (Groovy, Hydro, Indigo, even Fuerte) but it didn't help.
The base questions are:
1 where should i git clone the packages, so that catkin_make works?
2 why there is no msg/Stall.msg and src/stageros.cpp files in my stage folder (/opt/ros/hydro/share/stage) which i should patch with stage.patch
3 which version of ROS is suitable to run this project?

A:

in your usual workspace (created as described here, under src folder (/workspace_name/src)
don't know (as I didn't patch stage at all, basic functionality is there without it)
it works under indigo.
