Q:

mongodb_store in ROS Indigo require MongoClient package (as specified in the CMakeLists.txt line 9)

The error message while trying to make the package:
+++ processing catkin package: 'mongodb_store'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(mongodb_store)
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;genlisp;genpy
CMake Error at mongodb_store/cmake/FindMongoClient.cmake:72 (message):
  MongoClient not found.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  mongodb_store/CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package)

The line 9 in the CMakeLists.txt:
find_package(MongoClient REQUIRED)

A:

According to the ROS Index page for mongodb_store, that package depends (among other things), on mongodb and mongodb-dev.
Do you have those packages installed?

In general, to make sure you have all dependencies for a ROS pkg you're trying to compile yourself, you should run
rosdep check --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src

Provided the package you want to build has declared all its dependencies properly, that should alert you to anything missing.
If you want rosdep to also install them for you, replace check with install.

Edit: just to be sure: the mongodb_store package has been released in Indigo and Jade, according to its wiki page. If you don't need to work on the package itself, it might be more convenient to just sudo apt-get install ros-$release-mongodb_store.
