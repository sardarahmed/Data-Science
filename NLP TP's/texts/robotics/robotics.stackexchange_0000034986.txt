Q:

"rosmake teleop_base" gives "Failed to find stack for package [control_toolbox]"

Hi,
I am trying to get working the following simulation tutorial. I have electric on 10.04
http://www.ros.org/wiki/stage/Tutorials/SimulatingOneRobot
When I perform the "rosmake teleop_base" I get the following flavor of error.
Failed to find stack for package [control_toolbox]
Failed to load rosdep.yaml for package [control_toolbox]:Cannot locate installation of package control_toolbox: [rospack] couldn't find package [control_toolbox]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/electric/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/swords/ros_workspace:/opt/ros/electric/stacks:/home/swords/ros_workspace/teleop_base]
Appreciate some help on this.
Thanks!

A:

To answer my own question.
Simply remove reference to the control_toolbox dependency in the manifest.

The other option is to install the control_toolbox package. But if the dependency is unneeded it should be removed from the tutorial code.  If you could please file a ticket to get this fixed so it can be fixed for other future users.

How do you know the dependence is not needed? However, if you want to install it you can find it there: https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/stacks/pr2_controllers/tags/electric/control_toolbox/
