you didn't mentioned, but due to the error, I think you are running on Ubuntu 18.04, using an old Autoware version.
Please pull latest master branch or 1.12 alpha tag to solve this.

A:

As @amc-nu mentioned, you are running an older (pre-1.120-alpha.1) version of Autoware that is not compatible with Ubuntu 18.04/ROS Melodic. See the updated instructions at https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.ai/autoware/wikis/Source-Build to build version 1.12.0-alpha.2 or higher to work with Melodic.
