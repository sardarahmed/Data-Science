Q:

System plugin with DRCsim launch files

The launchfiles used to start up the DRC worlds don't allow for us to add a system plugin.  How would I do this?

A:

In atlas_utils/scripts, there are several scripts that invoke gazebo with plugins (for example run_gazebo calls gazebo -s libgazebo_ros_api_plugin.so. For the moment, you can edit these scripts, but there is a better fix in the works in drcsim pull request #198.

I am trying to run a system plugin (gazebo_ros_api_plugin) with standalone gazebo so that /clock will be published to ROS. Can you please explain how I can run "run_gazebo" with empty.world. Thank you
