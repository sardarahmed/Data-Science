Are you wanting to mark a costmap with your own costs or do you just want to use the costmap to track obstacles and inflation layers?

A:

In rviz you've used a Gridcells Display to try and visualise your costmap. The Grid cells display subscribes to nav_msgs::Gridcells, whereas your costmaps are published as nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid. Change your rviz configuration to use the Map Display type for your costmaps. The Map display type subscribe to nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid

I've not used Gridcells, but viewed costmaps using the costmap topic, in your case it should be /move_base/local_costmap/costmap. Do you have this topic?
