A:

I like to use rqt. Just type rqt in the terminal to access it. Select "plugins" from the menu bar to see all the tools available.
There are lots of plugins available for it which are also listed here. I think the process monitor plugin under the introspection menu would be useful to you, but there are many others that are helpful as well.

That's from 2010, it probably won't work with current ROS.
