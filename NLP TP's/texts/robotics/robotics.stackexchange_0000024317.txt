Q:

Siciliano et al. Rotation Matrix Notation

I'm reading Siciliano et al.'s Robotics: Modeling, Planning and Control, and I'm confused about the notation used in definiting rotation matrices.
On page 46, they state

If $\textbf{R}_i^j$ denotes the rotation matrix of Frame $i$ with respect to Frame $j$, it is
$$
\begin{equation}
\textbf{p}^1 = \textbf{R}_2^1\textbf{p}^2. 
\end{equation}
$$

To me, this notation says, "$\textbf{R}_2^1$ 'rotates' a vector from frame 2 to frame 1." However, in the discussion of fixed frames on page 47, they state that

$$
\begin{equation}
\bar{\textbf{R}}_2^0 = \textbf{R}_1^0\textbf{R}_0^1\bar{\textbf{R}}_2^1 \textbf{R}_1^0
\end{equation} = \bar{\textbf{R}}_2^1 \textbf{R}_1^0.
$$

If I try to apply my original interpretation, it would say that $\textbf{R}_1^0$ rotates a vector from frame 1 to 0, and then $\bar{\textbf{R}}_1^2$ rotates that vector from its frame 1 to frame 2, which doesn't make sense.
If I instead interpret it as, " $\textbf{R}_1^0$ rotates a vector from frame 0 to frame 1, and then $\bar{\textbf{R}}_2^1$ rotates that vector from frame 1 to frame 2," then that make sense too.
But then the first equation from page 46 doesn't make sense, since it would say, "rotate $\textbf{p}^2$ from frame 1 to frame 2."
Any suggestions on the proper way to interpret these expressions? Thank you!

A:

I'm building on Raghav's helpful answer to get to my original confusion. In short, I believe reading these matrix compositions comes down to how you interpret the transformations.
A current frame rotation like
$$
\begin{equation}
R_2^0 = R_1^0R_2^1
\end{equation}
$$
Can be understood two ways.
Way 1:
we rotate frame 0 $(F_0)$ to $F_2$ by rotating $F_0$ to $F_1$ and then $F_1$ to $F_2$. In this interpretation, we read the numbers on the matrices top-to-bottom.
Way 2:
we can express a vector currently in $F_2$ in terms of $F_0$ by rotating it from $F_2$ to $F_1$ and then from $F_1$ to $F_0$. In this interpretation, we read the numbers in the matrices from bottom to top.
Rotation Matrix Composition
At least with Siciliano's notation, we interpret compositions of current frame rotations with Way 1 because the focus is on how frames are being shifted at each step with post-multiplication.
