Q:

in UR5_Driver(Driver.py)--ImportError: No module named BeautifulSoup

Hi All,
This question is with reference to universal_robot package, I did a fresh installation of ROS Groovy on my Ubuntu PC(12.04) and also cloned the universal_robot stack from git-hub. followed all steps until catkin_make and sourcing setup.bash. The very first time I run this command
$ roslaunch ur_bringup ur5.launch robot_ip:=192.168.1.5

I get the below error, which is apparently a parser.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/bucky/catkin_ws/src/universal_robot/ur_driver/src/ur_driver/driver.py", line 11, in <module>
    from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
ImportError: No module named BeautifulSoup

During the previous installations, I overcame the same problem by installing the file using
$ sudo easy_install BeautifulSoup

The Question is, which version of the file should I install, BeautifulSoup or BeautifulSoup4 and should I update the PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did anyone face the same issue when proceeding with this installation?
Thanks and Regards,
Murali

A:

The beautiful soup package can be downloaded by the following:
sudo apt-get install python-beautifulsoup

This should not require any additional updates to the PYTHONPATH variable.  It should just work from here.
As an aside, the universal robot package is also available for groovy using:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-universal-robot 

By downloading the package using sudo apt-get, the dependencies like Beautiful Soup should be taken care of.  However, there are some features in the github groovy version that are not in the debian version.
