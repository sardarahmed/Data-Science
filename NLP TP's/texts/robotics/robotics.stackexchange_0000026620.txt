Q:

Rospython script crashing/unable to downgrade

I have a launch file which uses a python script for my simulation, it launches fine, however when I try to implement any of the functions in the simulation, the script continues to crash.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/david/DRC-Scratch-Repo/qual_task_1_bdi/scripts/qt1.py", line 674, in <module>

My friend who has an older version of drcsim(1.7) says it runs fine. But when I tried to install the older version after removing my own I got this from this command.
sudo apt-get install drcsim=1.7
E: version 1.7 for drcsim was not found.
So my issue is this, how do I properly install an older version of drcsim, or how can I modify the script to keep it from crashing?
This issue can also be followed on https://bitbucket.org/osrf/drcsim/issue/340/rospython-script-crashing-unable-to
where the script code is available
