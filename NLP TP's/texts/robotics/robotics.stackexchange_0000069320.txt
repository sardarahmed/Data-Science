Q:

Gazebo no messages from sensor

I'm just trying to get a basic ROS-controlled gazebo sim with differential wheels and lidar.    I have followed the gazebo tutorial and am launching from this test.launch :
Then my world file has,

model://my_robot

And my_robot.sdf has

model://hokuyo
0.2 0 0.2 0 0 0

hokuyo::link
chassis

0 0 1

0
0

However when I run with
roslaunch test.launch
I see gazebo and the robot, but there are no Hokuyo messages appearing in rostopic.   Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?
(I have tried editing hokuyo/model.sdf to
 /hokuyo_laser map 
but makes no difference)

A:

Self answer -- I'm using ROS Indigo and its gazebo, which are using  ~/.gazebo/models/hokuyo/model-1_4.sdf instead of hokuyu/model.sdf.    The required change to this file is
    -->
   
then it works :)
