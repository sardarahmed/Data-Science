Q:

Referencing non-ROS packages dependencies

Hi.
I'm trying to reference a non-ROS package through one of my ROS package but I not have found the correct option in the CMakeList to make this correctly. I want to include the .h of this non-ROS package on to my files, but i don't find the method to make visible.
Thanks in advance and sorry for this simple question, but I don't find any answer in the tutorials.

A:

You use the standard cmake directives, i.e.
include_directories(dir...) and target_link_libraries(bin lib...).
Additionally it is good practice to make a rosdep entry in the manifest if the library is a system package, so that other users can install the dependencies.
