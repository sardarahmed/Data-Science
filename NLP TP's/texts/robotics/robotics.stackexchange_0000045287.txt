Q:

Priority in rospy loglevel configuration

This wiki page show 2 ways to change log level of rospy; using rospy.init_node in code or using $ROS_ROOT/config/python_logging.conf file. I'm seeing with my system that when both ways are used, the code level config is dominant (meaning, setting in python_logging.conf is ignored). Am I correct? And if so, is there a way to make python_logging.conf reigns?
Here you can look at the python_logging.conf file I used , which I found at /opt/ros/fuerte/etc/ros/python_logging.conf, modified accordingly and moved to $ROS_ROOT/config/.

Good question; unfortunately I don't know the answer. But one quick comment: you shouldn't modify files under $ROS_ROOT; instead point the ROS_PYTHON_LOG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable to the location of your updated conf file, as described on the wiki page you linked to.

A:

I believe setting the logging level in code is always going to take precedence. As such you should rarely use it and only for temporary debugging.  Use the config file if you need it at startup or use rqt_logger_level to set it at runtime.
