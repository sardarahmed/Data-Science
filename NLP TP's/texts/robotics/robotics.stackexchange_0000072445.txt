Q:

On launching 3d sensor: no device connected

Reading through the tutorial I came to turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch

I receive  No devices connected... waiting for devices to be connected.
However, Kinect worked with previous openni_launch openni.launch
(in order to make it work, I had to change Globaldefaults.ini, as suggested in this question, if this info helps )
Did anybody have the same problem? What could be possible fixes?

A:

The problem was that I actually didn't have Kinect, but Asus Xtion Pro. However, as previously Kinect was used, the environment variable ROS_3D_SENSOR (in my ~/.bashrc file) was set to Kinect.
It was enough to remove ROS_3D_SENSOR=kinect from ~/.bashrc file (as asus xtion pro is default for indigo, according to wiki)
