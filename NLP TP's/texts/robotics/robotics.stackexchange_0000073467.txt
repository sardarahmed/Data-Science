Q:

How to change turtlebot gazebo FOV and make it 270 degree?

Hi! I am trying to change the settings of turtlebot  simulation, so I can get a better gmapping result.
But I can't find a better way to change FOV of kinect. Any help is much appreciated.
I went to the turtlebot_description folder and find the urdf file of turtlebot_gazebo.urdf.xarco.
I modified the following code.

<horizontal_fov>${60.0*M_PI/180.0}</horizontal_fov>

I edited horizontal_fov to change its FOV. If I change it like {160.0M_PI/180.0}, the result of gmapping can be shown on rviz tool;  but if I change horizontal_fov to more than {180.0M_PI/180.0}, the gmapping result will not be shown.
I have been looking everywhere but I can't find where I can remove the restriction and make simulated Kinect have a FOV of 270 degree. I wonder if there is a solution?
Thank you very much for helping.

A:

The simulated kinect uses a pinhole camera model. This model only works for FOVs below 180 degree, so there is no way you can over 180 without some major refactoring. There is a wide angle camera available for Gazebo (see this tutorial), but making this work for depth images might be significant implementation effort.
You're probably better off just mounting a simulated LIDAR to your Turtlebot.

Thank you!!! I will try to use a simulated laser scanner.
