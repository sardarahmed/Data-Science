Q:

global path display is shorter than use to be

HI
Some time ago I have the global path full display. From the robot place to the goal.
You may see the green line in the following video.

Now, i can only see the global path inside the dinamic window area.
You may see the line in the following video
It is the blue line (i changed from green to blue, beacuse local path is green)

I cant remember what I have done to do this change.
May anyone help me to restore the full global path display.
Thanks

A:

Changing the topic to be displayed from /move_base/TrajectoryPlannerROS/global_plan to /move_base/NavfnROS/plan may solve the problem.
