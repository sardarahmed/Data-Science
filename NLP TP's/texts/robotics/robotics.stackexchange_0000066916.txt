Q:

Should I bother myself with roslisp?

Hello.
I am choosing whether or not to dive into roslisp. It seems that tutorials are quite obsolete right now. The quesion is for experienced users:
How good is lisp-ROS integration nowdays and where is it going? Will it be maintained in the future?

A:

The code for roslisp is maintained and there are some people actively using it.
But it is true that the tutorials are not properly taken care of... I'll look into it at some point in May.

I've been trying to work out a simple ros hello world for a day but still gets nothing... can you provide some simple tutorial code that could work under catkin system? My email is zhangty10@gmail.com, thanks in advance!

You can find the code for the tutorials here: https://github.com/code-iai/roslisp_tutorials/
The only thing you need to do to get them to run with the current roslisp version is to comment out all the add_lisp_executable lines in the two CMakeLists.txt files.

Right now in order to run the script with ros, I'm putting extra header to the lisp file as mentioned in http://wiki.ros.org/roslisp/Tutorials/OrganizingFiles, and put
install(PROGRAMS
src/beckon.lisp
DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)
in the CMakeList.txt. But it can't work...

...saying ROSLISP does not designate any package
Comment by gaya on 2015-04-21:
Yes, you're definitely doing something wrong, at least the install line seems suspicious. Please create a new question with proper examples of your CMakeLists and the executable script.
