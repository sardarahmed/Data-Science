A:

Roboearth has only been released for ROS Fuerte. This release won't work under Hydro.
One of our students ported parts of roboearth to hydro. Next time I see him I'll ask him if he want's to push his work to Github.
In the mean time you either could use roboearth with Fuerte or start porting it by yourself.

Has there been any news on updating Roboearth to Hydro or even Groovy?
