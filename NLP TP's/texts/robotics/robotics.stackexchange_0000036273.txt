Q:

Synchronizing two or more image_transport subscriptions

Hi All,
I wish to be able to take two subscriptions from two image_transports and synchronize them using boost::bind and message_filters::Synchronizer. But message_filters::Synchronizer only uses sensor_msgs::Image and message_filters::Subscriber.
How do I synchronize image_transport and not message_filters::Subscriber ? so that I can finally use the input with cv_bridge to get a cv::Mat .

A:

Looks like a duplicate of Synchronizer and image_transport::Subscriber. If not, please elaborate.
