Q:

navigation using kinect without laser scan

Hello,
I'm new for ROS. And nowadays, I'm thinking about how to let my robot avoid obstacles and navigation only use a Kinect. I find a video in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmnepqAQIlk
I wonder if there are some important and useful information that you can tell me.
Thanks first.

A:

A really nice node called pointcloud_to_laserscan is used to create a fake laser scan from a kinect's point cloud. It is actually better than using a lidar in some cases since it doesn't just look at a single slice of space, but rather a swath that is defined using the max_height and min_height parameters. Once you have that fake laserscan, you can use it as input to any of the navigation algorithms that are meant for lidars. (I've never used this node, so I'm assuming this is what it does).

Thank you, pointcloud_to_laserscan is really a good choose . But I don't know how to use it, I use another package named perception_pcl instead. This package could work correctly, but its'  status is not good as there are few laserscan points.
