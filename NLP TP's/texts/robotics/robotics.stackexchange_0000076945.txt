Q:

source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash not found

Hello everyone,
I am pretty new to Ubuntu and am have some issues. I installed ros kinetic and can see everything located within the opt folder. However, as soon as I try to source it like the instructions say to do it says that the source is not found. Did I do something wrong during installation? I'm super stuck :/

A:

Can you please tell us how you installed ROS? Which tutorials did you follow (if any)? Which version of Ubuntu is this (probably 16.04 / Xenial)?
What is the output of:
ls -al /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash

(please add it to your question by editing it)
Also, can you check you have the ros-kinetic-catkin package installed? Something like
dpkg -l | grep ros-kinetic-catkin

Should give you that information.
