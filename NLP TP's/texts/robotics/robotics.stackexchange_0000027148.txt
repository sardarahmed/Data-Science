A:

I just had a similar need - a carpet on the floor. What worked for me was the following (with Gazebo 1.9):

In the world file:
 
   
     
       
         
           12.88 12.88 0.005
         
       
       
         
           file:///full/path/to/materials.material
           Materials/Carpet
         
       
     
   
   1
 

materials.material file:
material Materials/Carpet
{
technique
{
pass
{
ambient 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
diffuse 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
specular 0.2 0.2 0.2 1.0 12.5
   texture_unit
   {
     texture carpet14x14.jpg
     filtering trilinear
   }
 }

}
}

I pulled this one from somewhere else and just replaced the script name and texture filename.

carpet14x14.jpg in the same folder as materials.material
