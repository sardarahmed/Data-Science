Q:

Compiling ROS on Windows? Ubuntu not an option

Does anyone here actually know how to compile ROS on Windows? Please don't refer me to Ubuntu, I am using APIs that only works with Windows for my app that is controlling the Nao robot.
Ultimately, I want to be able to test C# code with the ROS Nao simulator--it doesn't appear that I can do this with NAOSim or Webots for Nao.

I'm curious to know what you need to test with the 'ROS Nao simulator': Gazebo support for Nao is extremely recent (a few weeks) and 100% experimental...

A:

There are attempts to compile ROS on Windows but it is experimental. So be prepared to fix things by yourself and face more-or-less up-to-date documentation.
To be honest, achieving to compile roscpp and the other low-level layers is certainly doable if you can deal with the technical issues you will encounter by yourself but having a full environment with big software such as rviz (or other newer GUI) will be extremely challenging.
This is why I would advise you to do as less as possible on Windows. Try to compile roscpp first then write wrappers around your Windows only / proprietary softs and back to Ubuntu for your own development. This will help you not suffer too much from the lack of Windows support.

Here is an alternative if you can use the WSL under Windows 10: http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows
