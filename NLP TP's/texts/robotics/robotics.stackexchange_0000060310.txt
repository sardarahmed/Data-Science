Q:

Why quaternion need to be conjugated first before conversion to rotation matrix?

Hi Stephan,
I am following the tutorial, but I have one thing that I still don't understand:
Why quaternion need to be conjugated first before conversion to rotation matrix?
For example in pose_sensor.cpp inside ssf_updates:
C_wv = state_old.q_wv_.conjugate().toRotationMatrix();
Why it's not just:
C_wv = state_old.q_wv_.toRotationMatrix();
I thought quarternion q_wv_ is already in the same reference frame as C_wv, as its name suggests???
Please give me some lights. Thanks a lot!
Best Regards,
Giovanni

Hi Folks,
I eventually contacted Stephan Weiss personally thru e-mail. This is his respond:
"The naming of the variables is not very consistent, unfortunately. q_wv should be q_vw, hence the confusion."
Hope this helps!
Cheers,
Giovanni
