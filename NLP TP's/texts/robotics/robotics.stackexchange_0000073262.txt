Q:

Using CH Robotics IMU UM7 with ROS

Hi,
I am using the UM7 Orientation sensor with the USB Expansion board from Pololu. I am using um7_ros to use the IMU with ROS. It is getting detected and the port is /dev/ttyUSB0. But when I run rosrun um7 um7_driver, it gives the following :
[ INFO] [1460061766.522068698]: um7_driver ver 0.0.2 connected to serial port.
[ WARN] [1460061766.620629302]: Timed out waiting for packet from device.

[ERROR] [1460061767.112069178]: Unable to set CREG_COM_SETTINGS.
[ INFO] [1460061767.112128423]: Attempting reconnection after error.

Also, when I run it using CHR Serial Interface software in Windows, I get the following error:
Error: Timeout while communicating with sensor.

In both Ubuntu and Windows, it is getting detected but the Communication is not taking place.
I am not able to find why is this happening. Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

If the Windows tool also doesn't work, it could be that something is wrong with your hardware. Can you test a minimal scenario? Has it ever worked?

I have the same problem while executing ros but when I tested the um7 with CH Robotics Serial Interface it works fine! However when try to read configuration by CH interfce it is blocked and only create graph works properly
--> communication with um7 is damaged (UM7 is partially damaged I think)

@Naman @rob_tun, Hi, Naman and rob_tun, now I have the same problem while executing ros node. And my hardware interface is Serial2USB.could you tell me what do you solved your problem?

A:

I ran into this problem last summer. The USB expansion board is crap. Try replacing it.
