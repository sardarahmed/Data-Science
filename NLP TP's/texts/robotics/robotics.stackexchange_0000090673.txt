Q:

Arduino Serial.println and initNode()

Hi, I am new to ROS and am currently playing around with Arduino.
I came across this problem where after I initNode(), the output in serial monitor turns into backward question marks.
  void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    
    //nh.initNode();
    //nh.subscribe(sub);
    
    //myservo.attach(SERVO_PIN);
  }

    void loop() {
    Serial.println(15);//used for testing println
    nh.spinOnce();
    delay(100);
  }

if I comment nh.initNode() the serial monitor works fine. If I uncomment it, the serial monitor turns into backward question marks. Thanks a lot!

A:

You cannot use rosserial and Serial.println() at the same time -- or at least: not with the same serial port.
rosserial must have (and assumes) exclusive use of the serial port it uses to communicate with your host. Otherwise it cannot work.
