Q:

[move_base] make_plan service crashes, transport error

Hey,
so I wrote a custom global planner plug-in and I have tested extensively, so I don't believe the error is there.  can launch rviz with move_base, costmap and a robot description. The issue arises as I want to call the service  make_plan() from the terminal. I am using the template completion provided by ROS.
The first time I call it, it gives me following error message but still compiles and publish the plan.
ERROR: transport error completing service call: unable to receive data from sender,  unable to receive data from sender, check sender's logs for details 

The second time I call the service move_base crashes and the following error message is displayed
[move_base-6] process has died [pid 10011, exit code -11, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/move_base/move_base __name:=move_base __log:=/home/rue011/.ros/log/06aca0b2-d577-11e7-bb08-d481d7bb040a/move_base-6.log]. log file: /home/rue011/.ros/log/06aca0b2-d577-11e7-bb08-d481d7bb040a/move_base-6*.log

Hope somebody can help, I have no Idea whats going wrong.
The log file ".../move_base-6*.log" is not not generated.

A:

Thanks ahendrix,
the issue was that I was calling a callback function while the action of move_base was still running, or rather by calling this callback and changing parameters of the current solver invoke a segmentation fault.
