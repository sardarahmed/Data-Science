A:

There is a tutorial part where they explain you how to install Turtlebot Simulator :
ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/Installing%20TurtleBot%20Simulator
You have to replace 'electric' by the name of your ROS version.
Note that as far as I know, turtlebot simulator is not stable (not working ?) on groovy and so there is no debs available for this version. So I wouldn't recommend you to try to install it from source.

If you want to use the simulator, you should better use a previous ROS version. Like fuerte and to follow the instructions which are on this link : http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_simulator/Tutorials/Installing%20TurtleBot%20Simulator
