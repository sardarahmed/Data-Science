A:

Do you want a dynamic array of geometry_msgs/Vector3 by defining your own message type ?
Like this:
Vector3Array.msg:
geometry_msgs/Vector3[] data

That's right. I guess I should use std_msgs/Float32MultiArray type. Can you give some tips? How can I write publisher and subscriber or create my own message?
