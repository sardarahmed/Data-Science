Q:

ROS Chat Group?

Just a random question as I have lots of questions to ask, is there any active Chat group for ROS?  I have quite a few questions and really don't want to spam the word (people have already been really helpful)

A:

Technical questions are best asked here, on ROS Answers (after having searched for similar questions and answers). For more general discussion, https://discourse.ros.org may be appropriate. There used to be a ROS Slack organization (essentially a chat room), but it has been phased out in favor of https://discourse.ros.org I believe. Ditto for the mailing list.

I think I have that one and 2 others on my Kindle, the issue I have is time (kids) plus I feel I am nearly there.

Man I wish there was a chat group, stuck for days and no ones replying :(

I absolutely agree.
With as many of us involved in this, it shouldn't be too much of a task to get such a chat group going. I love answers as a resource, but whether you get a response is totally random... Time is valuable, for all of us, what can I do to help promote this idea?

For what it's worth, asking questions here is beneficial to everyone because people having the same problem in the future are more likely to find it.
