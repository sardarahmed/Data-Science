Q:

how to calculate the angular velocity of end effector of two link robot arm?

I am trying to calculate the angular velocity of end effector of two-link robot arm. Can anyone help me to find it?
If $q_1$, $q_2$  are joint angular position and $\dot{q_1}$ and $\dot{q_2}$ are joint angular velocities, and $\omega$ is angular velocity of end effector, then I use $\omega=\dot{q_1}+\dot{q_2}$.
Is that correct?

A:

Yes, angular velocities are additive if that is all you're looking for (i.e., $\omega_2$ expressed in the base frame of $\omega_1$).  If you are trying to find the velocity of a point on link 2, then you need to add an $\omega $x$ r$ term.
