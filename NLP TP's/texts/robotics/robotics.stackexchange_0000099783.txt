Q:

Getting direction from single universal laser

I have 360 degrees laser coverage around a robot with the data published into a single topic. But because of that I can not tell what laser data reflects right, left, front or back or the robot.
Just wondering if there is a technic for detecting direction from a single universal laser reading ?

A:

if the message is a standard sensor_msgs/LaserScan, there are fields describing the angular coverage of the scan. The ray lengths in the ranges[] array should be ordered sequentially from angle_min up to almost angle_max, sweeping counter-clockwise if you look down from above.
The answer to your question is that, for the standard LaserScan message, angle 0.0 is "forward" in the sensor's own transform frame.
