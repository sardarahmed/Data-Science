Q:

Error in --rosdep-install

Hello everyone,
When I try this code "rosmake --rosdep-install rgbdslam" it gives the following error.
rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install
I installed rosdep using this command ."sudo apt-get install python-rosdep"
Then I found that   '--rosdep-install' option is available in ROS Electric and earlier. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS groovy. How can I solve this?Can somebody please help?
Thanks in advance

What instructions are you following?

A:

You can call rosdep directly.  The change is simply that rosmake no longer will call rosdep for you.
