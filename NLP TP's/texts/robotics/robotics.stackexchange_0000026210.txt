Q:

Gazebo-1.6 Update : build probem

I recently updated drcsim and gazebo to drcsim-2.3 and gazebo-1.6. SInce then I am unable to build controllers. I think it is not able to find the include files.
/home/bharadwajramesh/gazebo_plugin_tutorial/hello_world.cc:1:21: fatal error: gazebo.hh: No such file or directory
What is the problem here, am I missing something or is there something I should do ?
-thanks

are you using ROS along with it?

I have the DRCSim-2.3 also installed . I believe the DRCSim has Roc packages with it. So yeah, I do have ros

A:

I Have it fixed : I deleted all the files inside my build folder. And executed the cmake../ command inside the build forder again and build it. This WORKS. I dont know what it does though. If someone can tell me how it helped... it will be great. Thanks

When you run CMAKE, a lot of environment specific information is compiled into your executable files.  So when the contents were made before, it might have created executables that, for instance, were dependent on the file path to the old version of Gazebo. These executables end up in your build folder.  By clearing that out and re-CMAKEing everything, you recreate those executables with the up-to-date paths.
