Q:

sound_play.h not in included in ros-hydro-sound-play?

Currently, I am migrating my ros package from fuerte(rosbuild) to hydro(catkin). Even though the ros sound_play package is installed and runs properly, it seems the sound_play.h file is not included in the package anymore.
I worked around this problem by moving the file manually, but...
Can someone tell me whether this is intended and, if yes, the reason about this? The class SoundClient provided through this header file seems to be a very convenient tool to work with the sound_play node.
Thank you in advance!
Adrian

That is a bug in the sound_play package. I have created a ticket here: https://github.com/ros-drivers/audio_common/issues/27
