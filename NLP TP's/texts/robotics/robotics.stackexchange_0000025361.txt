Q:

Simulating Springs

I am looking to simulate a spring on a rotational joint in Gazebo.  My goal would be to have an arm maintain a position when no external force is applied, but give when a force is applied.  I see the "dampening" feature under the joint, axis properties, but I cannot find a spring feature.  Is there a way to do this?

A:

take a look at this spring test world
it checks equivalence between erp/cfm and spring constants.
see video of it in action.  Left most sphere uses a plugin that simulates spring forces, right 4 spheres have prismatic joints with 0 limits with different combinations of cfm and erp.  The world file contains explanation on the underlying equations.
