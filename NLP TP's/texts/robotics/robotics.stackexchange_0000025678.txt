Q:

How to comment an SDF?

Is there a way to add comments that aren't parsed to an SDF?
If so, perhaps this should be added to the SDF 1.3 documentation.

A:

The first line of the SDF documentation tells you that SDF is an XML file format ("The Simulation Description Format (SDF) is an XML file format"), hence you can comment it like any other XML file, i.e. using <!-- comment -->
