Q:

ROSberryPi For GoPiGo3: Install Pkgs or different Variant?

I'm attempting to create a ROS Kinetic installation on Raspbian-Stretch that has the packages needed for a GoPiGo3 node.
I followed ROSberryPiInstalling ROS Kinetic on the Raspberry Pi and chose the "recommended by the wiki" ROS-COMM variant.  (The wiki states only the ROS-COMM and DESKTOP variants have been "tested in Kinetic".)
I followed ROS-GOPIGO3_NODE: INSTALLATION, but my  ROS is missing the following packages:

geometry_msgs
rospy
sensor_msgs
nav_msgs
tf     (listed in packages.xml but is deprecated by tf2)

Should I ??

install only the missing packages,
start over and install the "tested" DESKTOP variant, or
or start over and attempt one of the REP-131 (groovy variants?)
install "ros-base (ros,ros_comm)", or
install "robot(extends ros-base with a bunch of stacks)

A:

I tried the "install only the missing packages" and have SUCCESS!
This is how I did it:

====== adding packages/stacks needed for GoPiGo3_Node
$ cd ~/ros_catkin_ws $
rosinstall_generator ros_comm
geometry_msgs rospy sensor_msgs
nav_msgs tf --rosdistro kinetic --deps
--wet-only --tar >kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
$ wstool merge -t src
> kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall
