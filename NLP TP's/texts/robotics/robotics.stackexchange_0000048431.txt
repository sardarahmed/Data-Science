Q:

Bumblebee2 output left/right images corrupted

Ubuntu 12.04
Ros: fuerte
Pkg: camera1394, bumblebee2 (partial code) migration to fuerte
Fotmat bumblebee2: format7_mode3 (1024x768)
It seems the 2 outputs images publish well but:
As mentioned here:
My left and right images are corrupted. It seems the output array have hollows (no information) and I see void points in the images.
Any ideas?
Thanks.

A:

You could try using the camera1394stereo driver.  It is basically the camera1394 driver adopted for stereo cameras. We have been using it for our bumblebee2 cameras for a while now. We stream the images in raw bayer format from the cameras to not saturate the firewire bus too much and let image_proc do the color conversion and rectification.

I did not know about this driver. Thanks for posting. I'll mention it on http://ros.org/wiki/camera_drivers

Thanks but I used it and get the same corrupted outputs as my program.

Then I would try the original pointgrey software to check your camera. We use this driver for four bumblebee2 cameras and it works fine. Maybe your cam is broken?

Ok I use the pointgrey software (triclops and pnmutils) and works very good. I try put triclops and ROS together but I have a problem with boost libraries. Maybe the problem is the way I launch the pkg. Would you give me more information like the steps you do to launch the nodes? Thanks

We launch the camera1394stereo_node with this parameter file: http://pastebin.com/1ugc1Zzt You can use dynamic_reconfigure to change some parameters online and try different settings.

Thanks a lot. I'll try as soon as I get the camera again.

Hi Stephane, I just want to know if you had a good disparity image result with your bumblebee2. I am using it to extract pointClouds and the result is not really good because of the bad calibration results. How can i use the calibration files of point grey with ROS ? Is it possible ?
Comment by INSA on 2013-04-02:
Or to publish the rectified images directly threw ROS ...

@INSA please ask a new question so that more people are able to help you.
