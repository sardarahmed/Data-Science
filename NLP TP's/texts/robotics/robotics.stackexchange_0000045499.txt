Q:

hector_slam: how to load a saved map (and perform localization)

Hi,
I read the tutorial about creating a new map with hector_slam and save it.
My question now is: how to load a saved map and use it for localization? (thus substituting amcl)
Thanks

that is exactly what I was searching for!

I am also really interested in doing that, but still new in ROS. Is there any update?

Does anyone have any updates?

A:

Yes, this is currently not supported. I meant to add it add some point (shouldn't be too difficult), but I'm quite stuffed with ToDos, so I probably won't be able to implement that functionality in the foreseeable future.

thanks for the nice work man! I am amazed on how well it works with my bad odom robot. implementing localization with a loaded map would be perfect. could you point some direction on how you would do it? I might give it a try! thanks

As long as one doesn't use multiple map resolution levels it shouldn't be too hard. Essentially, the map would only have to be read via some method at startup and not get updated later. The most annoying (even if not really complicated) thing is probably setting the transforms correctly.

Any progress on this yet? I'm trying to use the odom data from hector slam with a pre-saved map. Then I will use move_base with it.

Just brainstorming and was wondering if I just loaded in a presaved map using map_server and remapped the /map topic created from hector slam to something else. Then I could use the localization from hector slam and use a static map. Any comments on this approach?

Hi, may I check if anyone has implemented this (localization only) on Hector SLAM?
