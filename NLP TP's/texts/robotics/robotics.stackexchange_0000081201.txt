Q:

ImportError: No module named rospkg

I am using ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. When I typed this command, "roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch", the following error occurred. Please teach me how to solve it....

As this is FAQ, you should be able to find many other threads that are already answered.
While the accepted answer should work around your issue, I've asked #q282982 as a more fundamental question.

A:

try to install the package
sudo apt-get install python-rospkg
