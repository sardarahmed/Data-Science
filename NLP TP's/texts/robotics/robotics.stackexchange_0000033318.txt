Q:

Is there a simple way to see what services are being waited for?

While setting up new nodes, I find that I'm often trying to debug if I've set the remapping correctly, or what service a node is waiting for to finish starting up. Is there a simple way to list what services are being waited for?

No, there is no way of knowing what services are being waited for.
