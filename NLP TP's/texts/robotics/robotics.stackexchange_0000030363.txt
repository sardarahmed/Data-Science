Q:

Can I call one .launch file from another .launch file?

I'm writing a launch file for my kinect+irobot.
To start the camera driver, I was doing this:
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
Is there a way, in my .launch file, to just call openni_node.launch? Or do i have to copy/paste the node info from it into mine?

Likely an admin came along and did it for him.

Stop linking to other pages without writing the relevant part of the code! Stack Overflow Docet. Stop Ros answer anarchy movement!
