Q:

How to Log connections

Hi,
How can I log ROS TCP connection creations and destructions?
I'm trying to move all my clients to persistent connections to avoid recreating too many TCP sockets (to avoid they dangle for a couple of minutes), but I still have many TIME_WAIT connections (for which I cannot see to which process they belong with netstat nor lsof -i)
Maybe enabling logs for roscore?
We have diamondback but we're migrating soon to electric.
thanks

A:

Maybe it helps to set the loggerlevel of roscpp or similar to DEBUG.
