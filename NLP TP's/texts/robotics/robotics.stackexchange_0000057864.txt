Q:

Costmap subscribe problem in hydro

Hello. I'm now working on navigation stack in hydro. I want to use a global costmap to implement a new algorithm for path planning. So I created a node and subscribe to /move_base/global_costmap/costmap which is nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid type. The problem is this node receive costmap only one time when it come up and never update. In rviz everything is fine. Any idea ?
