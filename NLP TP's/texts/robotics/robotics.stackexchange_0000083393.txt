Q:

How to move to a certain point in space using Twist /cmd_vel

Hi, I'm a beginner and I'm struggling to make my robot move to a certain point. How should I set the angular and linear velocity for my robot to move to a certain point ?
For example, if my robot initial position is (0,0), what angular and linear velocity should I use for it to go to (5,5) ?

A:

I suggest you follow the ROS Navigation Tutorials, which will walk you through setting up a full navigation stack on your robot. This is much more involved than the simple node that BhanuKiran.Chaluvadi suggested, but you'll end up with a highly capable path planning system that can handle obstacles once you add sensors.
