Q:

[Erratic Robot] unable to launch this package!

Hi all
I am looking to launch the erratic robot I downloaded from (Am I using the outdated package?)
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-erratic-robot

then execute:
roslaunch erratic_navigation_apps demo_2dnav_slam.launch

But I got the following errorS from gazebo:
 Error [parser.cc:712] XML Element[filename], child of element[mesh] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[mesh]

A:

You need to also parse the robot model and spawn it into gazebo . Try other launch files in the gazebo apps package. There should be a move_base launch file. If you have your own urdf file, you can use it instead.

Hi, could you provide some detailed advice on parsing the robot model and spawn it into gazebo? For instance, in which package? how to parse the robot model? thanks!

Do you have a xacro file and a urdf model for your own robot? In your launch file you have to include the robot description and joint state publisher. Check gazebo tutorials on how to build your own model and to spawn it in the gazebo. Its pretty straight forward if you understood tf.
