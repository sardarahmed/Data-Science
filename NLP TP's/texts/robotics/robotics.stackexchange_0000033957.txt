Q:

Cannot locate node of type [stereo_vslam_node] in package [vslam_system]

I am trying to run VSLAM on Stereo Data. When trying to roslaunch stereo_vslam.launch, I'm getting this error message cannot launch node of type [vslam_system/stereo_vslam_node]: Cannot locate node of type [stereo_vslam_node] in package [vslam_system].  I cheched and found stereo_vslam_node was under vslam/bin, ans was not sure why ROS could not locate it?
I found a similar question posted earlier, and followed suggestions described in the "answer" section, but still got the same error message.  Any advices will be appreciated.
Thanks

A:

vslam is experimental research code. It is not actively being supported, but patches are welcome.
If you would like a robust method of localization and mapping with a stereo camera or kinect, use the 2D slam_gmapping stack. See the pointcloud_to_laserscan package from the turtlebot stack and the SLAM Gmapping with Kinect Tutorial for the turtlebot.
