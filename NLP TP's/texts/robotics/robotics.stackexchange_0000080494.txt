Q:

Is ROS2 going to support Python 3 and C++14?

My main question is in the title.
If these languages versions are not going to be supported, what are there the main reasons that prevent it from happening? What would be the libraries that are only supported for Python 2.7 and <=C++11 but not for the new versions of the programming languages, that the ROS team would like to include anyway in the system?

Probably yes. See this github wiki: https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki

A:

This page currently says the following:

C++ standard
The core of ROS 1 is targeting C++03
and doesnâ€™t make use of C++11 features
in its API. ROS 2 uses C++11
extensively and uses some parts from
C++14. In the future ROS 2 might start
using C++17 as long as it is supported
on all major platforms.
Python
ROS 1 is targeting Python 2. ROS 2
requires at least Python version 3.5.
