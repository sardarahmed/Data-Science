Q:

Any ROS tutorial which uses custom made msgs to publish data over topic

I have found a lot of tutorials in which messages files which are already provided by ROS are used to publish data over a topic. However I am planning on making my own custom messages to publish over ROS. Is there any tutorials which helps in that.
