Q:

"rostopic echo" of the kinect

I am using ubuntu 11.10.
I place the kinect toward white wall
and
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image
I can see the depth image
But rostopic echo /camera/detph/image
put different numbers(datas).
How can I get the same datas?
And how can I find actual distance using openni driver?

A:

What do you mean different? Are they very different, then something is wrong. If they are just a bit different, then that's normal. It's a sensor that has noise.
For the distances, you would subscribe to a pointcloud2 topic and not the depth image.
