Q:

How to determine the min_range and max_range for my RGB-D camera?

Hello guys,
I'm trying to do some basic depth detection and as described [here] by (http://answers.ros.org/question/10222/openni_camera-depth-image-opencv/?answer=14994#post-id-14994) by @fergs I need to know the min_range and max_range for my camera in order to convert my image. So how do I know that?
I am using a Carmine 1.09 and the website lists 0.35m as a minimum distance and 1.4m as a maximum one. Are these the values I should be using?

A:

You could use those values and filter out data beyond them. You probably won't see data below 0.35m, but you will definitely see data > 1.4m. With the 1.09 I've seen points out to ~6m, HOWEVER, note that the onboard calibration is really only valid for points in the 0.35-1.4m range, beyond that, the points become quite noisy and probably should not be used for anything like costmaps/octomaps.

By filter out do you mean ignore? Or is there some "soft" way to deal with the out-of-range data?
