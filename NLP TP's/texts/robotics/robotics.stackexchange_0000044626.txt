Q:

When will Debian packages available to Electric be available to Fuerte

I am working through the book "ROS by Example".
The book states:
"The latest version of Ubuntu is 12.04 (Precise) and the latest version of ROS is Fuerte. Many ROS users are still using Electric but Debian packages for Electric are not
available for Precise."
What is the projected date for this situation to change?

A:

There will not be Electric debian packages created for Precise, it's not a supported platform.  See REP 3
