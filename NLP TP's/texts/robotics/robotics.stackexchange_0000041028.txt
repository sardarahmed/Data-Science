Q:

sending sensor_msgs/CameraInfo with rosjava

Hello,
I'm attempting to send a sensor_msgs/CameraInfo message using rosjava. The message itself gets sent just fine, but I'd like to fill in every field of the message with my correct camera calibration information. I noticed there is a setK() method, as well as setP() and others to accomplish this task.
When I try to set those fields to some values, rostopic echo reports different ones.
In my code I have:
sensor_msgs.CameraInfo caminfomsg = caminfopub.newMessage();
double[] K = {160, 0, 160, 0, 160, 120, 0, 0, 1};
caminfomsg.setK(K);

But when I run it and take a look with rostopic this is what I get:
K: [4.4e-323, 5.337368564e-315, 0.0, 5.337368564e-315, 0.0, 5.337368564e-315, 5.33542582e-315, 0.0, 0.0]

Any suggestions?
