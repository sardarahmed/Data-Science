Q:

Is it possible to control a Motoman SV3 (MRCII controller) with ROS

Hi,
I have to work with this old industrial style robot for a university project. Does anyone have experience controlling this robot with ROS by any chance? Or have any other experience for controlling it? Or by any chance does someone have the Yasakawa mode password for the MRCIIs?
Thanks,
James

A:

You should look at the ROS Industrial stack: http://ros.org/wiki/Industrial/supported_hardware
Currently only DX100 controllers are supported. For the password you should contact your Yasakawa representative.
