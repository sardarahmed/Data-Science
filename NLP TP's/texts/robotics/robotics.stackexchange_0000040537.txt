Q:

ant finished with (non-zero) exit value 1

Hi,
I'm trying to build and install my android_core and up until now I've managed to get everything working except for an error which occurs during compilation of android_core. Here is the output of "./gradlew debug" in android_core directory:
    BUILD FAILED
/home/sam/Development/research/android-sdk-linux/tools/ant/build.xml:818: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/home/sam/Development/research/android-sdk-linux/tools/ant/build.xml:820: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/home/sam/Development/research/android-sdk-linux/tools/ant/build.xml:832: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/home/sam/Development/research/android-sdk-linux/tools/ant/build.xml:278: null returned: 137

Total time: 43 seconds

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':android_tutorial_camera:debug'.
> Command 'ant' finished with (non-zero) exit value 1.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Hi
We had the same problem
try this:
android update project --path ./android_tutorial_camera --target android-13
but make sure the target is the API level you want.
This worked for us.
We had to do it a couple of times for different packages.
Good luck
