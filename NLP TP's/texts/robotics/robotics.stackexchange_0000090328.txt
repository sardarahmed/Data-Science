Q:

rosout node and rosout topic

According to wikiros tutorials and my ros textbook, the node rosout subscribes to the topic /rosout, takes the messages, records them in a textual log file.
My inference from this explanation is some nodes publish some messages to the topic /rosout, and the node rosout records them in log file. In this point, a question comes to my mind:
which nodes publish messages to the topic /rosout ?
Can any node publish a message to the topic /rosout ?

A:

Can any node publish a message to the topic /rosout?

Sure: every node can publish to any topic

which nodes publish messages to the topic /rosout?

Any node using any of the ClientLibraries (which means: every).
Check out this section as well as the links. There it is detailed how ROS logging (e.g. using rospy.log* and ROS_* end up in /rosout).
