Q:

Is ROS-I support ABB S4C controller?

Hello! I am new to ROS.And I have an IRB 1400 robot arm and S4C controller. For now, I can't find any evidence show that ABB package support S4C controller. Had anyone try this? Or it just can't work?
Here is the link of related answer: is ROS industrial supported on ABB IRB 6400 m97a controller?

It's not a good idea to post comments on questions from 2016 with already accepted answers.
In any case: nothing has changed since I posted my original answer. Or at least: I'm not aware of anyone having ported abb_driver to S4C controllers or made anything else available.
That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just that I don't remember anyone releasing anything.

A:

I'd really recommend you send a message to the ROS-Industrial mailing list and see whether someone has already done this. Most users of those packages will be on the mailing list, so you'll have a better chance of getting a good answer there.
Do please report back if/when you get an answer.

You could always just try and see if you can get it to work, of course. The sources for abb_driver are here.
