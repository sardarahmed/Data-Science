Q:

How can I apply different control approach without having a state space model?

Recently i am working on a hydraulic control system of a vehicle. But in this system I don't have any mathematical modeling of the system so i am not able to get any state space model for the given system. I have to control the length of Piston in Hydraulic Cylinder by giving input of desired piston position. Modeling of this system is established in Matlab/Simulink using physical modeling tools SimScape Toolbox and simFluids. As one approach i had already try to apply a feedback with P-control as show in the figure Matlab System  and also the gain of P control is derived by trial and error.
Now if i want to apply state obeserver or optimal Control than how can i apply on this given system.
And is necessary to derive mathematical model of this system to desing controller?
Thank You.

A:

Many control strategegies (PID is not neceserily one of these) are computing some of their parameters from your system. If you do not want to model your system yourself (or play around with it until you identify its charecteristics) you can use Matlab to identify your system model using the system identification toolbox. 
The System Identification Toolbox will give generate some inputs for your system and will record the responce for these. Based on this it will generate a simplfyied model which can be used to represent your system. It is simplifyed but in many cases it works well as a substitute. 
When having this identifyed model you can freely implement any control strategy using the equations given after the system identification process.
