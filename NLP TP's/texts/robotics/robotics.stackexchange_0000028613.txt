Q:

subscribing gazebo messages for joint

Hi, I was subscribing gazebo messages from topics like ~/pose/info , ~/joints in stand-alone C++. I want to get data of joint like angle, velocity,etc. But, I am unable to see on any topic in gazebo. Can you help to access joint data from topic? Which topic should I access ?

A:

There are several ways, here's two of them:

You could send a request for entity_info like it's done here.
You could use introspection as described on this tutorial.
