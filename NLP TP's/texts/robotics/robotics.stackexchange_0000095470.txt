Q:

What's the meaning of "Don't forget to add the script to the CMakeLists.txt install rule"

I am parctising this web page:
http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28Python%29
There is one sentence:
Don't forget to add the script to the CMakeLists.txt install rule, reinvoke catkin_make_isolated and use your terminal with the devel_isolated/setup.bash sourced.
I don't understand the meaning of "Don't forget to add the script to the CMakeLists.txt install rule", what should be done according to it?
What scirpt? Where to add?
Thanks.

A:

It means to use the install CMake command like: https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/blob/melodic-devel/map_server/CMakeLists.txt#L101.
This makes it available in your install space and not just your devel space for debug.
