Q:

Groovy Source Install "rosmake -a" Build Error

Hello All,
I've been trying to install ROS Groovy from source (following the online instruction from the wiki) on my 32-bit Ubuntu 12.04 VM and have been making some progress.  But, I'm running into build problems when I execute the last step of the instructions, 2.2.3 Build the ROS Stack with the following commands:
$ source ~/ros_ws/setup.bash
$ rosmake -a

The starts of fine, but then errors out with the following error:

I've been trying to debug this, but since I'm new to ROS I haven't been able to get very far.
Has anyone else encountered this problem or a similar problem that would be able to point me in the right direction?  Maybe it's something that I'm overlooking?  Thanks in advance!

A:

The solution that I found at this time to get the rosmake -a step (the last step) to work is to delete the laser_pipeline folder (i'm working with the mobile variant) in the rosbuild workspace and clone the laser_pipeline stack from https://github.com/ros-perception/laser_pipeline.
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/laser_pipeline.git

Then checkout the latest branch (at the time of this post laser_pipeline-1.5.3)
$ cd laser_pipeline
$ git checkout laser_pipeline-1.5.3

Then re-run the rosmake -a command.  This is what worked for me to get my workspace built.
