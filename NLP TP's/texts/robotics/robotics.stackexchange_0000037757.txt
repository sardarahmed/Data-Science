Q:

Need to check the rosinstall for openni

Hi. I'm using ROS Electric in Ubuntu 10.04 lucyd. I have followed the full installation process and actualy I have already made some nodes succesfully. I want to use the openni_kinect pakage. I'm following this tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect#Ubuntu_installation-1 and it says that I need rosinstall. For that I'm following the next tutorial http://ros.org/wiki/rosinstall. Everything seems to be all right until this point sudo easy_install -U rosinstall. But when the tutorial says "After installation, rosinstall writes a bash setup file, called setup.bash, into PATH. Source this file to configure your environment variables." I dont know where to find that file. I wrote rosinstall --version and I got rosinstall 0.5.26. So I want to think that everything is ok whit rosinstall... but when I return to the kinect tutorial in 3.2 the make or even the make debian commands brings the following: GIT: Program not foun /  Built error 127. Is something wrong with the rosinstall? Or do I need something extra? I have already tried sudo apt-get install git, but it say git package is not aviable.

A:

Since you're using Ubuntu, you should follow Ubuntu Installation, not Source based installation. All you need to do is
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-openni-kinect

You don't need to run rosmake on packages you've installed using apt-get. "Failed to contact master" likely indicates a network configuration problem. Take a look at the troubleshooting wiki page (http://ros.org/wiki/ROS/Troubleshooting#Common_Problems).
