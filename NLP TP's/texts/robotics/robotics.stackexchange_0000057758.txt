Q:

how to find packages that meta-package contains

As far as I understand, ros is the meta-package that contains several packages, https://github.com/ros/ros/blob/indigo-devel/ros/package.xml, how do we not that which package does the ros contains?
k-okada@kokada-t430s:/opt/ros/hydro/share$ rospack depends ros
[rospack] Error: no such package ros
k-okada@kokada-t430s:/opt/ros/hydro/share$ rosstack depends ros
[rosstack] Error: no such package ros
k-okada@kokada-t430s:/opt/ros/hydro/share$ rospack depends roslib
catkin
rospack

As a side note: metapackages are only valid dependencies of other metapackages. They are mostly a convenience for users when installing.

A:

Metapackages are not supported by rospack / rosstack. Since metapackages are only meant for backward compatibility and convenient package installation for users there is no plan to add support for them.
As a workaround you can run something like this:
roscd ros
cat package.xml | grep "_depend"
