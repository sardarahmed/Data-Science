Q:

catkin configuration question

I have ros kinetic installed
I have projects that use rosmake
I have projects that use catkin_make
I have projects that use catkin build
I can not longer seem to get some of them to locate executable. I had them under a single directory under different src's
What is the proper structure for a system like this.  Since I added PTAM to src_nstd/src it can not  find executable s when using the launch file , keeps looking in src path and not devel.
My .bashrc file currently looks  like this:
   source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash 
   source /home/rjn/catkin_ws/src_nstd/setup.bash             # for rosmake
   source /home/rjn/catkin_ws/src_nstd/devel/setup.bash   # for catkin_make
   source /home/rjn/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash                 # for catkin build

catkin source structure looks like:
/home/rjn/catkin_ws/src_nstd/        # for rosmake -- does not use a src
/home/rjn/catkin_ws/src_nstd/src   # for catkin_make
/home/rjn/catkin_ws/src                 # for catkin build

I moved the catkin_make stuff to its own workspace.   I will do the same for rosmake.
But, Only the workspace build with catkin build a nd the kinetic installed launch files work. The ones built in catkin_make_ws exit with out giving an error. I can run them if I use rosrun which is odd but not launch file.

A:

issue resolved .... I created three independent workspaces and sourced them and add to ros path.
Looking ok.
