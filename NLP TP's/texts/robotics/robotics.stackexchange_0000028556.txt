Q:

How can I check if a commit has been updated to my Gazebo?

I want to use the Actor API but I am waiting on a commit that contains BVH distortion fix. How can I check if that commit has been added? I am not using Gazebo from source. Would there be a way to update my Actor.cc and Actor.hh files from source?

A:

You can find the instructions to install Gazebo from source here. In your case, since you want to use a custom branch, the advanced tutorial series should be useful to help you figure out how to pull the specific branch you want.
You may end up doing something like this:
cd <path to osrf/gazebo clone>
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/mingfeisun/gazebo -b default
hg up default
cd build
<usual build instructions>
