Q:

How can we change the quality of image/video which is streamed over web_video_server

I am using the usb-cam node to get the video from my webcam and using web video server to stream it in my private network. But the average bandwidth  is about 20MBps . I do not have that much link speed. What should be done to reduce it
so that i can stream without any buffering.

A:

See the web_video_server wiki page.
There's the description of the different video encoding parameters.
You can set these parameters within the URL e.g.:
http://localhost:8888/stream?topic=depthcloud_encoded&bitrate=250000&type=vp8
uses the VP8 compression with a bitrate of 250k.
