Q:

Using two topic's information in a subscriber's callback

Hi,
I have a design problem.
I have a topic with an image, that needs to be analyzed and I need to get a certain coordinate from it. I also have another topic with a certain coordinate.
I need to use both of those coordinates in a callback method. So let's say I have a subscriber's callback:
callback(imageInfo) {
    //I only get the imageinfo here
}

So I get the imageinfo there but I need to use the certain coordinate info also, to calculate a result.
I could create a global variable for the certain coordinate and have a different subscriber with a callback setting its value and then use the global variable in the callback(imageinfo).
But is there a better way? It doesn't seem that good.

A:

have a look at http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters
if your messages have Header fields with sync'ed time stamps you could use the TimeSynchronizer for instance:
