Q:

Turtlebot won't stop

hyness@turtlebot:~$ sudo service turtlebot stop
[sudo] password for hyness: 
stop: Unknown instance:

why does my turtlebot do this? It will start just fine, but the stop command does not work. Please advise if you need screenshots, or any other additional info.

That is printed if the turtlebot service is not running when stop is called.
