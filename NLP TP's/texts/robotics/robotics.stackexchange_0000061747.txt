Q:

what is the Timestamp?

1-Can someone please explain what exactly is the timestamp that is sent along with every message regardless of the data type ? This number is huge and its in the range of 4.7x10^18 .
2- For synchronization between GPS and for example IMU, can we simple look for the closest Timestamp and regard them as one ?
Thanks,
Naz

A:

In ROS messages timestamp is taken from your system, which is unix epoch time.
Check Unix epoch time here.
For synchronisation look  message_filters
Documentaiton of the datatypes are at: http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Time and http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Time

Also, if the workstation and the device are significantly off, you can sync the two with chrony. Just mentioning because it took me too long to figure out...
