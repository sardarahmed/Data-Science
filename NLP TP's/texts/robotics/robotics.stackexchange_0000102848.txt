libpcl-dev is a system library. Do you have a find_package(PCL REQUIRED ...) statement in your CMakeLists.txt?

A:

one of the missing part from my try, but I added that also in CMakeList find_package(PCL COMPONENT REQUIRED), AND missed this part : include_directories(   include   ${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS} ) and before ament_package() add this - ament_export_include_directories(include) Now it is working.

Your ros app having a dependency on pcl_conversions in CMakeLists.txt should have been enough for your build to succeed. However, this is the correct workaround if that doesn't work for some reason.
