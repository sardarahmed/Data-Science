Q:

Why there are two origin in defining xacro:macro link

Hi,
I am following the tutorial about urdf. In example 08-xacro, I don't understand why when defining the xacro:macro for a link/visual tag, there are two origin tags before and after geometry tags.
  <visual>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="${pi/2} 0 0" />
    <geometry>
      <cylinder radius="${wheeldiam/2}" length="0.1"/>
    </geometry>
    <material name="black"/>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
  </visual>

Thank you very much for your help.

A:

Having two origin tags does definitely not make any sense. This is wrong.
Can you link to the tutorial with this error? I didn't find it.
