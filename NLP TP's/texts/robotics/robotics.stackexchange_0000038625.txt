Q:

Problems with importing android_gingerbread into eclipse

I tried to build android app on ros. I followed the steps listed in this page:
http://answers.ros.org/question/2178/rosjavajar-missing-certain-packages#3713
When I am trying to import android_gingerbread into eclipse, I got errors in class org.ros.android.views.PublishingPreviewCallback. Eclipse has problems to resolve the type org.ros.message.std_msgs.Header.
The problem code is like this
**image.header.stamp** = node.getCurrentTime();

And the full error message from eclipse is like this:
Multiple markers at this line
- The type org.ros.message.std_msgs.Header cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
- Header cannot be resolved to a type
Can anyone help with this problem?
Thanks a lot.

Are you using the deb release or building rosjava from source?

Hi! I am trying to build rosjava from source

A:

finally with the help with these three links, i successfully import gingerbread
here is the link:

http://answers.ros.org/question/2178/rosjavajar-missing-certain-packages#3713
This on gives a general idea of how to setup the environment for rosjava android development. But since rosmake does not work on the latest rosjava, i have to refer to the second link to figure out how to build rosjava

http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/building.html
With the help of this link i managed to build build rosjava. You can find the generated jar file under rosjava_core/rosjava/build/libs/rosjava-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

http://geus.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/starting-with-rosjava-and-image-messages/
With this link i got my sensor message compiled and solved the problem for not being able to import org.ros.message.sensor_msgs.CameraInfo and org.ros.message.sensor_msgs.CompressedImage.

PS: Three jar files needed to be imported

rosjava_core/rosjava_bootstrap/build/libs/rosjava_bootstrap-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
rosjava_core/rosjava/build/libs/rosjava-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
guava-11.0.2.jar (http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)

Hope it helps!
