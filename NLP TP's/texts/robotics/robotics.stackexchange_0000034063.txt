Q:

Turtlebot Bringup error

Hi everyone,
The kubuntu was already installed on laptop, so I installed ros-electric-turtlebot, ros-electric-ros and ros-electric-apps and I configured the networks settings. But when i type "sudo service turtlebot start" I get:
"start: Job failed to start". and when I type "sudo service turtlebot stop": "stop: Unknown instance:"
This error is shown when I try to use "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup robot.launch":

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [robot_pose_ekf/robot_pose_ekf]:
Cannot locate installation of package
robot_pose_ekf: [rospack] couldn't
find package [robot_pose_ekf].
ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/electric/ros]
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/opt/ros/electric/stacks]

.
Also, when I use  "roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch", i get these errors:

[turtlebot_laptop_battery-4] process has died [pid 2985, exit code
1]. log files:
/home/USERNAME/.ros/log/9db4292a-d59d-11e0-8222-74f06d20ce80/turtlebot_laptop_battery-4*.log

.

Does anyone know how can I fix these errors?
Thanks in advance,
Lucas

A:

On your robot you should install ros-diamondback-turtlebot-robot. Currently the TurtleBot software is only stable on ROS diamondback.
On your workstation computer you should install ros-diamondback-turtlebot-desktop
If you have import errors similar to what is listed above then you are most likely missing rosdeps
try:
rosdep install turtlebot
