Q:

ros install on debian sid

Hello,
I installed fuerte catkin on my amd64/sid.
rosdep check ros_comm ran OK.
But rosdep install turtlesim returned

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
turtlesim: No definition of [qt4-qmake] for OS [debian]

Thus I updated my file rosdep.yaml by adding these lines:

qt4-qmake:
debian: qt4-qmake

I updated the file /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list by adding this line:

yaml file:///home/fabien/robot/ros/ros/rosdep.yaml debian

But rosdep update ends with this error:

ERROR: invalid sources list file:
line:
yaml file:///home/fabien/robot/ros/ros/rosdep.yaml debian
url must be a fully-specified URL with scheme, hostname, and path: file:///home/fabien/robot/ros/ros/rosdep.yaml

Any hints

@joq: Ok. I will give a try to commit my changes. As I'm not yet familiar with git, I hope I will not mess things up :-)

I encountered this problem while I tested the update from my git repository: ERROR: unable to process source [https://github.com/theedge123/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/debian.yaml]: mapping values are not allowed here in "<string>", line 6, column 19:

A:

The best solution is to contribute the missing rules.
That way, the problem you discovered will be fixed for other Debian users.
