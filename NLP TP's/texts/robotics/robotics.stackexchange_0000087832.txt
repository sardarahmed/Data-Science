Q:

Gazebo Simulation - Can't Find Node

Hello! I am attempting to run a simulation of a Turtlebot3 package on Ubuntu16.02 Gazebo. Everything seems to be going fine until the last .launch file (which of course is the one that I really want to see the behavior of), where I receive the error ERROR: cannot launch node of type [explore_lite/explore]: can't locate node [explore] in package [explore_lite] .

First, I launch roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch.
Second, I launch roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping since my other code is dependent on it.
-Then roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation move_base.launch
Last, I launch the following which is where I get the previously mentioned error roslaunch explore_lite explore_costmap.launch .

I'd love to be able to use Gazebo effectively, but there's just not much documentation out there that shows how to actually test your own code - just how to bring up Gazebo. Anyway, thanks for reading!

Hi @AmateurHour,
Have you installed the 'explore_lite' package?
I installed and ran it and it ran without any problems.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-explore-lite
roslaunch explore_lite explore.launch

I did a rosclean purge and rebooted my pc and that seems to have fixed it, thank you!!
