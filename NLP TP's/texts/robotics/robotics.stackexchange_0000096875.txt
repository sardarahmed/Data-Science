Q:

Issue with subscriber launch

I am working through tutorials and am having issues with launching my subscriber launch file.
I have created a launch file named odom_subscriber.launch and have the following text in the launch file:
<launch>
    <node pkg="read_odometry" type="odom_subscriber.py" name="odom_sub_node" output="screen" />
</launch>

I have created my python file named odom_subscriber.py and have the following text in it:
    #! /usr/bin/env python
    
    import rospy
    
    from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
    
    def callback(msg): 
    
      print msg 
        
    rospy.init_node('odom_sub_node')

sub = rospy.Subscriber('/odom', Odometry, callback)

rospy.spin()

However, when I try to launch the launch file I get an error. I know I am not subscribing to anything just yet but I wanted to test it to see if all was good at this stage.
To launch the file I used the command:
roslaunch odom_subscriber.launch

I then get the error:
[odom_subscriber.launch] is not a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Does anyone know where I have gone wrong?

I actually had this in my notes that I had taken and never spotted that I had to add the package also, how silly of me....

A:

EDIT: as corrected by @gvdhoorn
The syntax for running a launchfile is
roslaunch <package_name> <launchfile_name>

OR
roslaunch /path/to/file.launch

So in your case it would be sth like this:
roslaunch your_package odom_subscriber.launch or roslaunch /path/to/odom_subscriber.launch
See the roslaunch wiki

It could be this helped the OP, but for completeness: roslaunch does support launching .launch files not hosted by packages. So you could actually roslaunch /path/to/my.launch.
