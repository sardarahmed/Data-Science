Q:

Gazebo missing methods GetDamping() and GetUseCFMDamping() for joints

How do I find out the damping of a joint in Gazebo?
There is a SetDamping method for joints, but no GetDamping method.
dampingCoefficient is a protected attribute, so I don't know how to access it.
Thanks
Chris

A:

ticketed.  Without direct access to gazebo API, one can also get the robot parameters from robot URDF stored in ROS parameter /robot_description (just the damping coefficient, not use_cfm_damping).
Non-compilable pseudo-code below:
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <urdf/model.h>
#include <urdf/link.h>
...
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  ros::init( argc, argv, "get_robot_description");
  ros::NodeHandle rosNode;
  std::string urdfString;
  rosNode.getParam("/robot_description", urdfString);
  urdf::Model urdfModel;
  urdfModel.initString(urdfString);
  std::cout << urdfModel->getLink("l_leg_lax")->dynamics->damping << "\n";
  return 0;
}
