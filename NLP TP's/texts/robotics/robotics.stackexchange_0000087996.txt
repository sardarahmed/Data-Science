You could read the documentation and tutorials and come back as soon as you run into a real problem.

Callbacks are used with the subscribers to get messages from topics, so just check the ros publisher tutorial

A:

I would suggest you go through tutorials, and get basic grasp of what callbacks are for and how publishers work.
