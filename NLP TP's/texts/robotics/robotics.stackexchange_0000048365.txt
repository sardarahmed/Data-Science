Q:

Running gscam simultaneously on multiple laptops having a common ROSmaster

I have three laptops of which one will act as the master. They are all connected to the same network. When I try to run gscam on one slave and access it from the master the setup works perfectly. But when I run gscam on the second slave, the first slave's terminal that was running gscam receives a shutdown request citing the reason "new node registered with same name" and stops working. The second slave starts working. But I want them both to run simultaneously.
I tried changing the node name by changing the executable name in the CMakeLists.txt file. Even then the problem persists.

A:

Don't change the name of the executable, change the node name by passing: __name:=new_name
You can also produce a roslaunch file the automatically assigns anonymous node names.
