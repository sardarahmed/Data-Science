Q:

Conversion between world and occupancy grid msg

Hi all,
I have a map of the environment my robot has to move in. The map is stored in the standard way as an occupancy grid
map and served via map_server service. I want to implement a PRM on top of this map so I need to access the value of
the occupancy grid from the world coordinate. To be more precise, given a point in the map frame (say [x0,y0]), I need
to access the value of the occupancy grid of [x0,y0], that is, I need a conversion from the world coordinate to the index
of the vector that represents the occupancy grid.
Do I have to implement everything from scratch or there are already some api that perform this conversion?
Regards

Also, this question should be closed or merged with the other one. I am new so do not know how to do that.
