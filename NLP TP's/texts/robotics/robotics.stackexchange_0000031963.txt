Q:

Adding Header files to package

This may be so elementary, but by using functions from any header file in the "include/whatever_pkg_name" folder of the package, the compiler complains about "Undefined reference to...". What step am I missing? The include files are properly called from the source code.

No, it's nothing external. It's a very simple call to a function declared on a header file inside the "include" folder. I will send you the code for you to see what I'm talking about.

Looks like a linking problem. Are you calling functions from an outside package?

A:

Actually, my problem was that I wasn't including the related .cpp files in the CMakeLists.txt, for example, I only had

rosbuild_add_executable(sphereo_node src/sphereo.cpp)

which was missing the remaining source files that implement the functions in the header file my_header.h, such as:

rosbuild_add_executable(sphereo_node src/sphereo.cpp src/my_header.cpp)

Thanks to Bill and Ivan!

Thanks! Searched for quite a while. Thanks for pointing out such a mistake for me. Now it seems so obvious... :)
