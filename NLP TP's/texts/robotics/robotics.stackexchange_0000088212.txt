Q:

ros_canopen: virtual joints, is it possible?

Hello,
Currently I have three working canopen motor drivers,
but my system will consists five motors later (the two missing motors have not been delivered yet).
I have already tested some basic motions based on the five motor system in gazebo, and now i wonder is it possible somehow to test these motions on the real robot.
So, i have a JointTrajectoryController, consists of joint_1, joint_2, joint_3, joint_4, joint_5, and  (required_drive_mode: 7)
but in the driver.yaml file which is passed to the canopen_motor_node, i only link three joints, namely:
nodes:
  - name: joint_1
    id: 1
  - name: joint_2
    id: 2
  - name: joint_3
    id: 3

My question is: is it possible to somehow, virtually, link joint_4 and joint_5 to the canopen_motor_node?
Because with the current yaml file, i got the error that there is no hardware interface for joint_4 and joint_5.
Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Ákos

A:

Currently, canopen_motor_node does not offer this feature.
Please feel free to open an issue. Of course a pull request would be welcome as well :)
