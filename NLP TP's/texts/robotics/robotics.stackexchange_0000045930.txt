Q:

Gazebo Crashes when modifying joint velocities

Hi All
Just trying to test a plugin to a sdf model of a 7DOF manipulator. In order to test, my i've included the following line in the plugin's OnUpdate() method:
joint1->SetVelocity(0, 0.001);
There are a few other lines in that method but they dont crash the system.
joint1 is a physics::JointPtr and SetVelocity is a method of a joint. I am using rosmake, and it seems to compile fine. However when I go to start GAZEBO I get the following message:
gzserver: /usr/include/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:418: T* boost::shared_ptr::operator->() const [with T = gazebo::physics::Joint]: Assertion `px != 0' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
Any suggestions

Okay got to the bottom of this one too!
Very simple, joint1 was not initialized properly.
the name used in physics::model::getJoint was not correct!
it was "joint1" not "Joint1"
cheers
