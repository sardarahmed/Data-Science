Hi there,
does anybody know if there's a way to put an enum type into a message? How's it done?
Thanks!

A:

You can use constants in ROS messages:

They don't map explicitly to higher-level enum types in programming languages, but they generally let you deal with the same issues.

@Murph: that's correct

Do you mean something like .. create an integer field, then create a series of constant fields to map integer values to the enumerated types?

I know this is a very old chain, however has this been implemented? Could I have a look?
