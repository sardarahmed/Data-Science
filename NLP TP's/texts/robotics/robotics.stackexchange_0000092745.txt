Q:

How to build and source from Eclipse

I am currently working on a .cpp file in Eclipse (called myownstuff.cpp which I put in the turtlesim package). Whenever I want to run it, I have to type this in the console:
catkin build turtlesim
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun turtlesim myownstuff

Is it possible to do (parts of) these commands in Eclipse? I tried some options related to building and sourcing, but they don't seem to work. Any help or ideas are welcome!
