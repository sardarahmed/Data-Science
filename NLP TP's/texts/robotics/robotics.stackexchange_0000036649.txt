Q:

Unscented Kalman Filtering?

I want to use an unscented kalman filter (UKF) in ROS to do state estimation. I can't find any ROS packages that implement an UKF so I've been looking around at filtering libraries for C++ that I could use within ROS. Does anyone have any recommendations? I've found the following libraries but many are poorly documented or inactive. Any suggestions?
UKF support:
Bayes++
bfilt
No UKF support:
Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (The main page lists UKFs but the code doesn't appear to implement them)
Orocos Bayesian Filtering Library
KFilter

Hi Andrew! OpenCV implements Kalman Filter,  Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is fully integrated with ROS. But I am afraid it doesn't implement UKF (as far as I know).

A:

Since you already know you want to do an unscented KF, I assume you understand the mathematics. I would suggest just implementing the math yourself using the matrix/vector capabilities of either OpenCV or Eigen libraries which are already part of ROS.
