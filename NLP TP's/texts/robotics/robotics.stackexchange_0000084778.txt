Q:

Invoking "make -j1 -l1" failed

Trying to set up a ROS environment in Ubuntu with the instructions here:
http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_software_setup/#install-ubuntu-on-remote-pc-desktop-or-laptop-pc
I run into an error at step 5.2.1 after the last command below.
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros_kinetic.sh && chmod 755 ./install_ros_kinetic.sh && bash ./install_ros_kinetic.sh

error: ‘const struct turtlebot3_msgs::SensorState_std::allocator<void’ has no member named ‘torque’
if (msg->torque == true)
^ turtlebot3/turtlebot3_bringup/CMakeFiles/turtlebot3_diagnostics.dir/build.make:62:

Error 2 Invoking "make -j1 -l1" failed

Any thoughts on what may be causing this? I get the same error if I try to run catkin_make after following the emanual robotics instructions as well.

A:

I have encountered a similar problem with the same error output:
error: ‘const struct turtlebot3_msgs::SensorState_<std::allocator<void>’ has no member named ‘torque’  if (msg->torque == true) ^ 
Explaination:
There is no current message that has the format turtlebot3_msgs::SensorState which can be found in your catkin_ws workspace.
Steps To Rectify:
1. Follow the steps after where you left off at step 5.2.1 (Here's the link again.Click Here)
2. Under 6.3 Install Independent Packages, ensure that you are in your catkin_ws/src and run the following command according to the emanual.
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
This is where the turtlebot3_msgs::SensorState message is located.
3. Return back to the root of your catkin_ws  by running $ cd ~/catkin_ws
4. run $ source devel/setup.bash
5. run $ catkin_make
It worked for me. Hopes it works for you as well.
