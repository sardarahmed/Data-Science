Q:

[Error] nodelet pcl/* crash

Hi,
I've switch to Groovy and we i tried to run my launch file with calls a pcl nodelet, the nodelet crashes.
I tried to load it manualy (command-line) and i'm getting the same error.
I do
$ rosrun nodelet nodelet manager __name:=nodelet_manager

And get
[ INFO] [1360435647.453864706]: Initializing nodelet with 8 worker threads.

all OK.
In another terminal i run:
$ rosrun nodelet nodelet load pcl/PassThrough nodelet_manager ~input:="/camera/depth_registered/points"

and i get:
[ INFO] [1360435704.541942377]: Loading nodelet /pcl_PassThrough of type pcl/PassThrough to manager nodelet_manager with the following remappings:
[ INFO] [1360435704.542172024]: /pcl_PassThrough/input -> /camera/depth_registered/points
[FATAL] [1360435704.550783258]: Service call failed!

and on the 1st terminal (nodelet manager) i get
[ERROR] [1360435704.550185447, 1358879347.082131986]: Failed to load nodelet [/pcl_PassThrough] of type [pcl/PassThrough]: According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class pcl/PassThrough with base class type nodelet::Nodelet does not exist. Declared types are  depth_image_proc/convert_metric depth_image_proc/disparity depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyz depth_image_proc/point_cloud_xyzrgb depth_image_proc/register image_proc/crop_decimate image_proc/debayer image_proc/rectify image_view/disparity image_view/image nodelet_tutorial_math/Plus openni_camera/driver stereo_image_proc/disparity stereo_image_proc/point_cloud stereo_image_proc/point_cloud2

This happens even without running anything that publish the /camera/depth_registered/points. I can make this happen with just 3 terminals, the roscore and the two i described here.
Also this happens for the Passtrough, VoxelGrid, StatisticalOutlierRemoval
Thanks

I get the same error using the very latest Groovy debs (pushed just last night) and Ubuntu 12.04LTS.  Everything was working fine under Fuerte.  Ticket submitted here https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/issues/7.

A:

This has now been fixed in the latest Groovy debs.  See the (now closed) ticket at: https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/issues/7.
