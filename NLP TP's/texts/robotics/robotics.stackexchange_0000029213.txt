Q:

gzserver: error while loading shared libraries: libdart-collision-bullet.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I don't even know how did this happen. One day, I just open the laptop and start to work. Suddenly, it's not working anymore.
I can't even run turtlebot3. I reinstalled foxy and gazebo11. No luck. It just...out of blue not working again.
killall gzserver/killall gzclient/ pkill doesn't help at all. ANy idea? I really want to use gazebo again
error
gzserver: error while loading shared libraries: libdart-collision-bullet.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

even i reinstall gazebo11, this happens still.
bwuk@robots:~$ cd /usr/local/bin/gazebo
bash: cd: /usr/local/bin/gazebo: No such file or directory
bwuk@robots:~$ 

I still have .model though
bwuk@robots:~$ cd .gazebo/models/
bwuk@robots:~/.gazebo/models$ 

Everytime I load gazebo from launch, it simply frozen, crashed or says directory doesn't exist.
How did this happen?
I even echo path, but it just don't show any result
bwuk@robots:~$ echo $GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH

bwuk@robots:~$ echo $GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH

bwuk@robots:~$

A:

Solution:
sudo apt remove --purge libdart*
Remove dartsim/ppa in Software & Updates -> Other Software
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libdart-dev
sudo apt install libdart-all-dev (only if above installs)

But if this failed due to unable to fetch some archives, run this
    sudo apt update --fix-missing && sudo apt install libdart-all-dev
    

    Install gazebo curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh

Finally,
Type gazebo (to check if it works now)
If you still getting error after attempt to load gazebo from launch in ros2, then follow this;
. /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh inside your workspace.
