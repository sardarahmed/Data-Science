Roslaunch machine tag on include

I want to run a launch file on a remote machine. Is it possible to specify a machine for an  call in a roslaunch file?

A:

No this is not possible, this is nodes which are run remotely. On the opposite there is no computation linked to the XML files so there is no mean in launching one remotely. Therefore, all includes are local to your machine.

As @Girmi 's answer shows, there actually is a way to tell subsequent node launches which machine to use. Are there plans to put that implicit mechanism into an explicit tag for include, too? It would be extremely helpful since the current situation is sub-optimal for hierarchical launch structures.

Maybe Thomas is right. I tried @Girmi suggestion but still run local launch file on my local computer, not remote.
