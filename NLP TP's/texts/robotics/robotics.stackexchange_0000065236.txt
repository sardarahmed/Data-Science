Q:

roscore fails to start

I have just recently moved.  My project worked before, but I cannot even run roscore now.  This is the error I have received.  Does anyone know a fix?
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ roscore
... logging to /home/ecejames01/.ros/log/314256dc-9f5b-11e4-96a8-000a9de008e4/roslaunch-ECE521-2982.log
Checkingt log directory for disk usage.  This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage.  Usage is <1GB.

Unable to contact my own server at [http://ECE521:43402/}.
This usually means that the network is not configured properly.

A common cause is that the machine cannot ping itself.  Please check for errors by running:

    ping ece521

For more tips, please see

    http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup

ping ece521 gives me: ping: unknown host ece521
Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

EDIT:
In a new terminal window, here are the results from commands:
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ hostname
ECE521
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ echo $ROS_HOSTNAME

ecejames01@ECE521:~$ echo $ROS_IP
68.55.84.72
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
http://localhost:11311

Running ifconfig eth0 gives me inet addr: 10.0.0.9.
My localhost is 127.0.0.1.
Forcing ROS using these methods allows roscore to run:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
roscore

export ROS_IP=MY_IP_ADDRESS
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$ROS_IP:11311
roscore

Thanks gvdhoorn for all your help.

A:

ping ece521 gives me: ping: unknown host ece521

Make sure your current hostname is actually ece521. If it isn't (which your ping output seems to suggest), make sure you aren't forcing ROS to set ROS_MASTER_URI (or ROS_HOSTNAME) to include that incorrect name (check your .bashrc).

My project worked before, but I cannot even run roscore now.

The ROS middleware needs a properly working network. If that is not available, roscore can't start.

Edit: before trying more complicated things, first try to force ROS to use bare IPs, instead of hostnames. In a fresh terminal:
export ROS_IP=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$ROS_IP:11311/

Then try to start just roscore in that same terminal.
You can retrieve your IP either through the Network Manager, or by simply running ifconfig eth0 (provided you are using your (first) wired NIC).

This is what I got:
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ hostname
ECE521
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ hostname -i
hostname: Name or service not known
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ hostname -y
hostname: Local domain name not set

I checked .bashrc and didn't see anything changing the ROS_MASTER_URI/HOSTNAME.

afaik, hostname will return whatever is configured locally. You might want to make sure your local hostname/dns/network configuration is consistent with what your network admin has configured for you in the DNS & DHCP. If ece521 does not resolve to an IP, you will get problems.

I am relatively new to this beast called Linux, so I probably need a walk-through, if you don't mind, since my Google search hasn't helped me much.  I am on my home router.
Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.
Comment by sealguy77 on 2015-01-27:
Both of these worked:
export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
http://localhost:11311
roscore

and
export ROS_IP=MY_IP_ADDRESS
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://$ROS_IP:11311/
roscore

However, I have to run both sets of commands for each new terminal window. Thanks

So that would seem to be a DNS issue then. Note that setting $ROS_HOSTNAME to localhost will prevent multi-pc setups to work properly.

However, I have to run both sets of commands for each new terminal window

You could add the two export statements to your ~/.bashrc.

Is there any way to correct the DNS issue?
Comment by sealguy77 on 2015-01-27:
Also, something I have noticed since moving is that something is unusual with using sudo...for example:
ecejames01@ECE521:~$ sudo echo hello_world
sudo: unable to resolve host ECE521
[sudo] password for ecejames01: 
hello_world
ecejames01@ECE521:~$

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-01-27:
I would systematically check your hostname/dns setup on your local machine as well as on any routers/home gateways/what-have-you. Also check /etc/resolve.conf, NetworkManager, /etc/hosts etc. If all else fails it might pay to do a sudo grep -i ece521 -r / and see what comes up.

Maybe see this question/answer: http://askubuntu.com/a/59517/37292
Comment by sealguy77 on 2015-01-27:
jarvisschultz: I checked that site out and made the appropriate changes.  It fixed my sudo: unable to resolve host ECE521 issue.  Still no-go on roscore.  I will continue to investigate as gvdhoorn suggested.  I'm new to Ubuntu/Linux, so any info to help me configure my network so roscore works...

Now when I attempt to run roscore, I get:
... logging to /home/ecejames01/.ros/log/bb787ab2-a658-11e4-a844-000a9de008e4/roslaunch-ECE521-2610.log

Then it just gets stuck until I KeyboardInterrupt.
Comment by sealguy77 on 2015-01-27:
Okay...I'm an idiot.  Checked my .bashrc and found export ROS_IP=68.55.84.72 there for some reason.  Took that out and everything seems to be running peachy-keen.  I don't remember why I had set my ROS_IP in my .bashrc.

Thanks all!!!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-01-27:
I distinctly remember asking you to check your ~/.bashrc file in my first answer .. ;).
Comment by sealguy77 on 2015-01-27:
You did...lol.  You said check for ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME, not ROS_IP.  Sorry...I'm too new to know to look for anything other than what you said.
But once you walked me through the export ROS_IP=MY_IP_ADDRESS, I learned what you were trying to get me to do and what to look for.
