Q:

Easy way to change your camera in ROS-gazebo

Hi,
The camera in my model does output a black-white image, and I do not know how to change it (it's quite a complicated model), therefore I've decided to change the camera to a different one.
I am wondering, what are the places in which I should do changes, except my .world file.

A:

The camera will be somewhere in your robot model's file. That can either be a SDF file or a URDF file.
If it's a SDF file you can see what a camera tag looks like here.
If it's a URDF file you can see what a camera tag looks like here.
