Q:

How to create a GUI for turtlebot

Hi all,
I am new to ROS and currently I can run a launch file which tell the turtlebot where to go but he next step is to create a GUI with different button so it will run different launch file when the button is pressed. After some research I think ROSbridge is what I need but I am very confused on how it works. If you have any idea, please help. Thanks

A:

You could look at making a Python rqt plugin.
If you want a standalone GUI with none of rqt's extra features, here's a really good video series to get you started in 10 minutes:
Designing a GUI
Unfortunately it doesn't cover ROS integration.
Either way, I don't think ROSbridge is required unless you want a web interface.
