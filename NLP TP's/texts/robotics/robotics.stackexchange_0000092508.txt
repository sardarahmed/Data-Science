Q:

ros-kinetic-husky-simulator installation failed

I try to install ros-kinetic-husky-simulator by commanding:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-husky-simulator

as is said in the tutorial at http://wiki.ros.org/husky_gazebo/Tutorials/Simulating%20Husky .
I get this error
E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

and notice a lot of errors like this one
E: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-kinetic-husky-gazebo/ros-kinetic-husky-gazebo_0.3.1-0xenial-20190131-135412-0800_amd64.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 64.50.233.100 80]

If I look at the website, I see that version 0.3.1 is no longer there. It now contains 0.3.3. Therefore I suppose the installation-link that I am using is not working properly. Can anybody help me on how to install the simulator? (I am at beginners-level in Ubuntu.) And also, hopefully we can fix it in the tutorial, as I suppose at this moment everybody who tries to install it has the same problem.
Thanks in advance!
