Q:

attach model to link

Hello,
I've been trying to attach a static model to a link of a mobile robot. Somehow this is completely ignored by gazebo and I don't know why. Please see the code below:
        physics::WorldPtr world = physics::get_world();
        physics::ModelPtr test_model = world->GetModel("test_model");

        physics::LinkPtr link = model->GetLink("link3");
        math::Pose pose;
        pose.Set(1,1,1,0,0,0);
        link->AttachStaticModel(test_model,pose);

in what context are you doing this? in a plugin? maybe you could provide us with a file that we could test with.

Hi,
I cant upload a file because of my insufficient karma < 10.

The code is called within the ConnectWorldUpdateStart callback, so it should been updated in every simulation cycle. Is there another way to provide you the file?

yes, pastebin.com should work, in the case you can't put the link in directly just use some spaces in the link :S. Is there a reason why you're not using SDF for that matter? Do you want to change the attachment state during runtime? Otherwise you can use something like in this tutorial: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.4/build\_robot/attach\_gripper

Hi,
I've just added the file. Can you see the problem?

A:

A note about your pasted code: Pausing and unpausing the world within an update call does nothing.
Is camera_model a static model?
Make sure to detach a static model before attaching it to a different link.
