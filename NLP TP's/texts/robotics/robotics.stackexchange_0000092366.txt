Q:

What is the difference between the usage of %i, %d,%f in ROS_INFO("")?

I see a lot of usage of like
ROS_INFO("%d")
ROS_INFO("%i")
ROS_INFO("%f")
used, is there a difference in the usage of them? If so, what are the differences. Is there like a webpage where this has been explained?

A:

ROS_INFO and other ROS log functions follow the same format as the standard C printf function. You can find more information here http://wiki.ros.org/rosconsole and http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/
The ones you mention:
int decimal_integer_value = 5;
float float_pont_value = 10.0f;
ROS_INFO("%d", decimal_integer_value);
ROS_INFO("%i", decimal_integer_value);
ROS_INFO("%f", float_point_value);

Would output:
 5
 5
 10.0

%d and %i are equivalent and use to print decimal integer values, %f is used to print floating point numbers"
