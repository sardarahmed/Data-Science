A:

I haven't seen anyone on this forum asking about AGL before. I had a quick look at the AGL mailing list and found a similar question, but no report of success or failure: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/automotive-discussions/2017-June/004319.html
ROS can be compiled to run on most flavors of Linux, assuming you can meet the dependencies specified in REP-003. I'd suggest you start with the robot metapackage, since it includes the command-line tools but doesn't include rviz (which can be difficult to build and run on embedded Linux)

From a quick look it appears AGL is Yocto based, so perhaps bmwcarit/meta-ros can be of help (if it doesn't already answer the OP's question). @Lukas Bulwahn is maintaining that.
