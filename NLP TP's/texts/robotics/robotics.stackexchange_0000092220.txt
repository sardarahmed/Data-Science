Q:

Time stamps in header message is always 0

Using ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu linux. For some reason, the time stamps (sec, and nsec values) in the standard header msg always come out as 0.
Does something have to be 'enabled' somewhere?

A:

ROS does not set the header timestamps automatically; the code that publishes the message has to set the timestamp.
