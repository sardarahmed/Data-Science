Q:

It is possible to run the simulated omni-wheel robot without plugins

Hi there,
I am wondering if it is possible to simulate an omni-wheel robot without moving it with the gazebo plugin (Planar Move Plugin), If so, can someone help me make it?
I would appreciate it, thank you!

A:

yes you can if you thing of normal wheels, but with mecanum \ onmi wheels it get to complicaten with all the roller and and friction so you resould would not be better then the planar mover.

In my case, I want to build my robot in a simulation in order to test there some things, not in the real one but to have almost the same results as if I did it in the real one... it is achievable or it isn't worth it?

what kind of kinematic do like to use? if you have somethin like http://www.karispro.de/ then it schould work if you have some think like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIiF0I7LT-g you will not have bennefits compared to the planar mover.

It's something like this

if it is the 3 sweden wheel then it is in the same class as mecanum and you can use the planar mover.
you can look at the https://github.com/GuiRitter/OpenBase may it helps.

Basically, I am trying to do  the same as he does from around two weeks ago and it's difficult to implement it, and many problems in the movement were appearing.. maybe I am doing something wrong idk because I am relatively new to this environment. Nevertheless, I will move on with the planar move plugin so thank you for the time and help! If you want something to add, I am waiting.
