Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rospy nodes

The rospy API docs have a list of modules that are part of the rospy library. For someone wanting to write nodes using rospy, which modules in the api docs should he/she be concerned with. The reason I ask is that some of those modules are marked internal only. Does that mean people writing nodes need not be concerned with them?

A:

For writing a rospy node, the best documentation of the rospy API is the rospy overview.
The most commonly used rospy functionality is documented there. In general, I would suggest only looking at the autogenerated API docs if you can't find what you are looking for in the overview pages.
