Q:

Can I test gmapping without a moving robot?

I know that gmapping needs to subscribe to /tf and after searching on websites, /tf is published by odometry of a moving robot (I'm not sure if I understand in the right way).
Now I only have .pcap file collected by velodyne and I successfully have converted it into laserscan. I don't have a moving robot but I want to test if gmapping works (The .pcap file contains data of my room, I want to see if gmapping can draw a map of my room)
I tried to do that but in RVIZ, the map status says "no message received"
Does it mean I must have a moving robot to realize?

A:

Gmapping requires odometry to go along with the laser scan, see http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping section 4.1.5. It needs the TF base_link -> odom
It may be possible to provide this with laser scan matcher package:

I saw that the laser_scan_matcher has indigo release but when I run
roslocate info laser_scan_matcher

It says it does not exist. Do you know if it's available for indigo?
