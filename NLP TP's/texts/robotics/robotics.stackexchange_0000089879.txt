Q:

CMake Error while installing ROS2 packages with colcon

I am following the colcon tutorial: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Colcon-Tutorial/.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/master/ros2.repos
vcs import ~/ros2_ws/src < ros2.repos
colcon build --symlink-install

I got an error message below.  How would I fix it? Thanks.
 Starting >>> fastrtps
--- stderr: fastrtps

A:

That sounds like you're missing a dependency or two. Have you installed all the system dependencies for installing from source?
https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Linux-Development-Setup
In particular the libasio-dev package, but you should make sure all the dependencies are available.

Yeah. Thanks. Missing libasio-dev. The colcon document did mention it.
