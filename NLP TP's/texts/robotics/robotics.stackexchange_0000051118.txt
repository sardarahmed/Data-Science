Q:

geometric_shapes_msgs has not been declared

Im following this tutorial : http://www.ros.org/wiki/ompl_ros_interface/Tutorials/Specifying%20pose%20goals, and it says geometric_shapes_msgs has not been declared.
I check the package and it's not in my ros system (fuerte, 12.04). do I need to install that package separately? Thanks in advance

A:

The problem is solved, since the motion_planning_msgs has been changed to arm_navigation_msgs, geometric_shapes_msgs is not longer valid, replaced by arm_navigation_msgs itself.
