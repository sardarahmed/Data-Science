Q:

Problem with OpenCV on Kinetic

I am finding a way to resolve OpenCV issue with ROS Kinetic. After trying using cvg_sim_gazebo package, the functionality is now broken which previously was working. Is there any workaround to make it work, be it using OpenCV2 or OpenCV3. I've also tried to use OpenCV2 but I am restricted to ros-kinetic-image-view package and its dependencies.
