Q:

Finding python modules in rqt plugins?

I have defined Python modules in setup.py for a package and these modules are found when running Python programs from another package using rosrun. But running
rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui -s lrs_rqt/rqt_quad.quad.Quad

where I in quad.py have:
from quad.qcon import *

then it does not work. It does not find the qcon. So does it work differently with plugins? And if so how does it work?
I am using groovy and catkin.

A:

This was a Python mistake. The file I did
from quad.qcon import *

in was called quad.py and that seems not to be a good idea. I renamed it and everything is working as expected.
