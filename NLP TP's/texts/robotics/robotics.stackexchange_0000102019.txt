Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable

Hi, I did exactly what's written in the procedures above, and it seems like no error popped up. However, ROS is not actually installed...when the above commands are executed, ROS is simply not there and when I run roscore, an error popped up

A:

This is being tracked in ros2/ros2#1287.
As this is a known issue, I suggest (future) readers to refer to that issue, instead of posting here.
