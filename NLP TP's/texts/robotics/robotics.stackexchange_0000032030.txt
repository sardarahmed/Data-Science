Q:

how can I modify the value of a transform when playing back a bag file?

Just like there are message filters, would it be possible to make tf filters?
I often find I want to modify the value of a single node in the tf tree when I have a bagfile, or to eliminate broadcasts on tf altogether.
It also could be useful to associate/utilize multiple tf's together, even when broadcast at different rates. Like ApproximateTime can do with messages

A:

There's a tool called tf_remap which does approximately what you want.  You can use the mappings to rename the unwanted frames and then republish them using another process.
