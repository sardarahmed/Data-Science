Hi Eduardo,
I'm afraid you tried to follow the ros_control tutorial that was not ready to be used yet (as noted at top of page). There have been lots of changes with ros_control since I made that initial draft. I just over-hauled the tutorial and now I'd say it is much closer to being production ready (90%).
In particular, the format of transmissions that you have attempted to use has changed, be sure to update your URDF transmissions.

Very good Dave, your tip worked, but I'm still having a problem, [WARN] [WallTime: 1374687405.894700] [48.796000] Controller Spawner couldn't reach controller_manager to load controllers. My yaml:(https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6072791) and my launch: (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6072802)

I think this is a namespace error...
you might could try to change your namespace to ns="/"
This worked for me...
