Q:

Joysticks priority setting

Hi everyone,
I'm trying to set up a priority between two joysticks which from different computers to control a robot.
Now, the robot will follow the latest signal come from the joysticks. I want to set a main joystick and a second joystick.
Thanks

Are you using them to send cmd_vel twist messages?

Yes, I have a node to subscribe the topic "joy",
So I'm thinking is it possible to edit the joy_node to public different topic name? like joy1 joy2
I found  /opt/ros/groovy/share/joy but I dont know how to edit

A:

You can use a launch file to assign different namespaces to the nodes as shown in this tutorial under 1.4.2.  Also, you can use cmd_vel_mux which allows you to assign priority levels to cmd_vel messages which will block conflicting messages by dropping one with lower priority.
