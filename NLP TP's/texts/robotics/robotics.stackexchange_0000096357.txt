Q:

ROS2 Python quaternion to euler

Dear ROS community,
I am trying to use the function "quaternion to euler" using python for ROS2 eloquent, but I can not import the right library.
Here there is not example related to that: https://github.com/ros2/geometry2

A:

For anyone who stumbles upon this in the future, now there is a function available in the tf_transformations library called euler_from_quaternion in ROS2 Humble and above.
You can use it by importing it first from tf_transformations import euler_from_quaternion
Then convert the quaternion to roll, pitch, yaw by
orientation_list = [orientation_q.x, orientation_q.y, orientation_q.z, orientation_q.w]
(roll, pitch, yaw) = euler_from_quaternion(orientation_list)
self.pose_yaw = yaw
