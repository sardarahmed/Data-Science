Q:

Meaning of s_last in D star Lite algorithm

In the D*Lite algorithm, described in line 21 of Figure 3, on page 4, in D* Lite, the main() starts with defining $s_{last}=s_{start}$. But value of $s_{last}$ is never updated in the entire algorithm. 
So what is the purpose of defining this term and what does it mean?

A:

$s_{last}$ does change.
Looking at the pseudo code, $s_{last}$ is updated upon each iteration of the while loop in main(), in line 31, $s_{last}=s_{start}$, if the condition on line 29 is met:
if any edge costs changed

Likewise, in figure 4 $s_{last}$ is updated on line 39:
