Q:

Cancel RosService Call

In my program I have a service call when I need to get some data.
if(ros::service:call("service_x", call_x))
This service goes and gets data from a sensor, processes the data, and pubishes the results.
I want to know if there is way that I can cancel or kill this service call if the sensor node crashes or becomes unresponsive.
Thanks All

A:

No, services do not support timeouts, cancellation or preemption.
If you need that, you should probably take a look at actionlib.
