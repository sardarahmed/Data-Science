Q:

Weird magnetometer values

I bought a 3-axis magnetometer (Similar to this one ) And plugged into an Arduino in order to read the heading value.
I mounted it on my robot and I drove with the robot for around 30 meters, turned 180 degrees and drove back to my starting position. I plotted the heading value and it shows inconsistent values. The 180 degrees turn started at sec 55, the rest is driving in one direction using a joystick and following a wall as reference so small deviations are expected but not that big as in the image.

When the robot is turning in-place, there is no such problem and the heading variation follows the rotation of the robot. The robot (Turtlebot) is a little bit shaky such that the magnetometer doesn't always have the x and y axes parallel to the floor but I don't think few degrees of offset can cause such a huge difference. I calculate the heading as follows:

heading = atan2(y field intensity, x field intensity)

Why does this happen? Could it be form some metals or electric wires under the floor?
Can you suggest a more robust method/sensor for estimating the heading in indoor environments?
EDIT:
I drove the same path again and the pattern similarity is making it even weirder

A:

Apparently a magnetometer is useless in indoor environments like man made buildings. I cite from this paper
Multi-Magnetometer Based Perturbation Mitigation for Indoor Orientation Estimation

Nevertheless, the success of these sensors for orientation estimation
  is conditioned by their capacity to sense Earth’s magnetic field in
  environments full of magnetic anomalies like urban canyons and
  indoors. These artificial fields contaminate Earth’s magnetic field
  measurements, making orientation estimation very difficult in heavily
  perturbed areas.
