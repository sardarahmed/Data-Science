Q:

Dynamixel Speed control / wheel (continuous rotation) mode

Hi,
I have started working with Dynamixel motors (RX-64), and I know that it is possible to use the motor in a continuous rotation (a.k.a wheel) mode. I can't seem to figure out how this should be done?
Somewhere I found that if I set the motor's CW and CCW angles to 0, it should change to a speed controller, but I can't figure out how?
I have tried calling a service of set_speed.
In addition, can someone explain what does the values in the motor field in the tilt.yaml file?
There is init, min, max. I understand that it is something to do with the angles, but don't understand what.
Thanks,

Hey,
http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/CreatingJointPositionController   // This link has information about what init, min, max refers to
http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/Creating%20a%20joint%20torque%20controller // This link as it officially states is the way we can run the dynamixel motors in wheel mode
Idk if it is helpful or not now.
