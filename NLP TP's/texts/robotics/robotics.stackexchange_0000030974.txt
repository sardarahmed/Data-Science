Q:

Is CyberGrasp ROS interface available?

Hello, all.
It appears that ROS I/F for Cyberglove is available.
(http://www.ros.org/wiki/cyberglove)
This I/F will be very helpful for those who use Linux system to integrate the CyberGlove series.
I am wondering if ROS also supports for I/F for CyberGrasp system.
CyberGrasp system consists of CyberGlove, exoskeleton module, and Force Controller Unit(FCU).
The FCU communicates with external user PC through ethernet.
This is somewhat different from CyberGlove which uses serial port or USB.
