Q:

Is it possible to set xbox controller rumble using JoyFeedback?

I see when I use rxgraph while running the joy_node for an xbox controller that it does not subscribe to JoyFeedback or JoyFeedbackArray. Is there any other way to set the rumble for the xbox controller?

I'm considering buying a Logitech Rumble Gamepad F510, I'd really like to know if ROS can set the rumble there also (or if rumble works or it from Linux at all).  The p3joy page mentions supporting the JoyFeedbackArray ( http://mirror.umd.edu/roswiki/ps3joy.html?distro=hydro ).

Did you manage to get the xbox controller rumble working from ROS ?

A:

I made this feedback node a while ago (and haven't tried it recently):
https://github.com/lucasw/joy_feedback_ros
It uses a custom message type rather than JoyFeedback.
