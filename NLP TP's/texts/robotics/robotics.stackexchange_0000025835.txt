Q:

Atlas controller ignores limits from URDF

In the DRCSim 2.0, I have noticed that when sending position commands (to say for example the neck_ay joint), that the velocities reported by /atlas/joint_states are much higher than the velocity_limits defined in the URDF.
Can we expect this to be fixed for the VRC, or should we continue to assume that we can see velocity and/or effort values that exceed the URDF limits?

I've noticed that because there is no limit checking going on, if you are tuning the PID controller, and choose a bad value for a PID gain, you can easily cause Gazebo to crash (presumably because the effort it commands is too high or low).

A:

For effort limit, there is a pull request in gazebo.

This pull  request works so much better than before, as tuning PID gains on joints doesn't cause the robot to collapse or Gazebo to error due to high effort/velocity values.  When can we get this into the Debian repository version so that all my VRC team can start tuning controllers?

will create a new pr targeted at gazebo_1.4 for patch release.
