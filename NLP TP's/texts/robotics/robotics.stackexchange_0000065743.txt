Q:

running several nodes in different machines using bash or python script

I want to use multiple machines to run several nodes. The idea is to use ssh from several terminals. I am workingon running these nodes using a python scipt using sshpass command. I am aware of the security issues but all machines are mine.
before i run the command in a python script or in a pash file I run it in the command line and it didnt work:
I wrote the folllwoing in the command line:
sshpass -p 'password' ssh user@host rosrun package_name node_name 

but it didnt work... The error was :
bash: rosrun: command not found

What should I do ?

Stuff like this is usually solved with the machine tag in a launch file.
