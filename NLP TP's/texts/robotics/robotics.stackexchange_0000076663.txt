Q:

RViz: backward-compatible?

Let's say I have a robot, running Indigo on Trusty, and a laptop, running Kinetic on Xenial. Would I be able to monitor the robot via RViz from the laptop?

A:

In this case I think it will work. However, you normally cannot assume comparability between distributions.
This is only possible because there were not so many changes between the two versions that affect rviz.
