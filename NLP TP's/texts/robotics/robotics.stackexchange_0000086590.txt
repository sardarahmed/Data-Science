Q:

rosbag : rewrite the values of a topic

Dear all,
what can be the best way to rewrite the values of the messages in a topic in a bag file. For instance, how can I go about creating a new bag that contains modified values of a topic of another bag file (example : multiply the twists in topic of nav_msgs/Odometry messages and store the results in a new bag) ?
Thanks a lot for your help.

Thanks for your answer. I have already seen that page. I have two problems with that :

I don't know python
Therefore I need a tool or a code snippet that replaces the values in a topic and saves the changes in a new bag

Thanks a lot.
