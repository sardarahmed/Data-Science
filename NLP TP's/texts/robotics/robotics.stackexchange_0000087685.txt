Q:

Use of --symlink-install

When we use --symlink-install for a build, that means the changes made in the source files would be reflected in the install files automatically ? Is this correct ?
If I change a source code in the source directory and save and run the node using ROS2 run command, would it be reflected ?

A:

Generally yes, but that's only true for interpreted languages. Compiled languages need to be recompiled to take effect.

yes, I meant python for example.

Just make it more clear for future people, --symlink-install applies for languages such as Python, but not for languages such as C++.
