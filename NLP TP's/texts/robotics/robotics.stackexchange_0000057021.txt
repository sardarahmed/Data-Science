When I run:

Comment by hsu on 2014-02-03:
what do you see when you run  "ls /src/testbot_description/urdf/my_robot.urdf"?

A:

There is a dot missing in the second tutorial.
From your catkin workspace, run: ./devel/lib/testbot_description/parser ./src/testbot_description/urdf/my_robot.urdf
It worked for me.
