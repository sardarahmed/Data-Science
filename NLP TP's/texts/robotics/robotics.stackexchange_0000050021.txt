Q:

pr2_robot source on kforge or github?

The pr2_robot stack page links to kforge/pr2_robot for the sources, for every distro, but it states new issues should be reported on github/pr2_robot. As there also is the full and newer (?) source, and with the general move to github in mind, I'm confused if the source link is correct and to be used?

A:

The pr2 github organization and repositories were created after the groovy release, so groovy debians are being built from kforge. However, I presume that hydro releases will come from the new github repositories.

And patches seem to be welcome on github.
