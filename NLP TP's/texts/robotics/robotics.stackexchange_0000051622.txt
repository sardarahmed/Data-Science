Q:

ROS installation on Ubuntu taking too long

I am a ROS as well as Ubuntu newbie. I am trying to install ROS on Ubuntu 12.10 (quantal).Its been more than 6 hrs since I started install Step 1.4 (Desktop-Full Install) described on the Ubuntu installation page on ROS.org. All I see on the Ubuntu terminal is this ....
"Selecting previously unselected package "...insert package name here..."
Unpacking "........"                                                                   (it is doing this selecting and unpacking of various packages one after the other)Seems to be never ending. Is this normal or am I doing some wrong.

A:

That is the normal outputs.  The length of time is surprising, often that suggests you have issues or hardware that is not powerful enough. What hardware are you running?

Old system-Dual boot PC, intel T2400 1.83GHz,RAM 2GB, ATI X1300 ...
