Q:

catkin_make install only selected packages

I have a catkin workspace that contains multiple packages, however I would like to install the catkin workspace to a Install directory, with only a few selected packages instead of all packages. Is this possible?

A:

catkin_make --help
leads to

--pkg PKG [PKG ...]   Invoke 'make' on specific packages only
