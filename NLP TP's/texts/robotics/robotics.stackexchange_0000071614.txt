Q:

How to start gazebo_ros gazebo with DART Physics engine?

I am trying to spawn a manipulator with urdf in gazebo and control using ros_control. How do I set the physics engine to be dart? I can get gazebo to run on its own by running: gazebo -e dart. How would I do the same with rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo?

A:

Yes. You can try adding the verbose flag, in case something isn't right the error or warning is displayed in console:
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo --verbose -e dart

Thanks, but I get this error: ROS get_physics_properties service call does not yet support physics engine [dart].

Am I missing something or is its a work in progress? If its a work in progress I could try to fix this and push the fix.

I am facing the same problem. The terminal shows the error " ROS get_physics_properties service call does not yet support physics engine [dart].", however, the GUI is showing DART correctly. Is this a bug?
