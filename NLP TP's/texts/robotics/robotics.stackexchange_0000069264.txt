Hello,
I'm installing ros hydro on ubuntu 12.04 in beaglebone black,
the processor is ARMv7,
the OS type is 32-bit.
After running "sudo rosdep init" successed, when i run "rosdep update", it shows error as follows:
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ rosdep update
reading in sources list data from /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d

And I run "which rosdep" & "rosdep --version" & "apt-cache policy python-rosdep", the result is:
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ which rosdep
/usr/bin/rosdep
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ rosdep --version
0.10.30
ubuntu@ubuntu-armhf:~$ apt-cache policy python-rosdep
python-rosdep:

Version table:

Please help me do with these errors.

I also have this error, anyone to help?

A:

The error here is Name or service not known, which suggests that you don't have a network connection, or your DNS settings are incorrect.
Are you sure your network connection is working? Try ping www.google.com
