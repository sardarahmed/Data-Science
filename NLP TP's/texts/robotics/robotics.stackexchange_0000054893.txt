Q:

Left side of laser scan visualization on android gets weird

Hi. I'm trying to visualize the laser scan read on android. I am doing similar thing that can be found in many sample source codes. This means that I declare VisualizationView laserView, then I add two layers - laser scan and robot image by laserView.addLayer(new LaserScanLayer("scan")); laserView.addLayer(new RobotLayer("base_link")) and finally I execute it with nodeMainExecutor. The problem is that it display everything perfectly only on the right side of the robot, left side shows some kind of artifacts, remains from previous scans. The laser is hokuyo rug-04lx.

Yeah. I described the problem but didn't ask the question. Do you know how to fix it? I was trying to manipulate the LaserScanLayer code but achieved nothing.

A:

Effectively the artifacts seen are remainders of old scans. The solution was to update the limit of the vertex buffer according to the points received to only show the new data. This was fixed by this PR.
