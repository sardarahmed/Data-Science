Q:

How to highlight points in point cloud on mouse over?

Hello,
Is it possible in RViz to highlight a single point in a point cloud and then publish its coordinate?
Edit: By highlighting I mean get coordinates of the point on mouse moved.

A:

You can select a single point in the point cloud with the selection tool, and you can publish a point which you click on the screen, but I'm not sure you can do both. You might have to write an rviz plugin to accomplish this.
