A:

Hi, the first thing I would do is make sure that your Ubuntu repositories are configured to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse.". You can find the information for this over here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu
And as the error message suggests, you could try to update your Debian package by using sudo apt update in the terminal. After that, you could try to install the full desktop version of Ros with this command in the terminal: sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full.
This worked for me, hopefully for you as well (:

Hi, Ubuntu is already configured to allow restricted, universe and multiverse.
I had also executed "sudo apt update" but it didn't help.
Also, I am trying to install full desktop version only.

Did you try everything else that they specify in http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu?

Yes @MaxM, I had followed the instructions line by line.
