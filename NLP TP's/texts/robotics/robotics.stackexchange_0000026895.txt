Q:

How to Programmatically Create SDF models/files

I want to create SDF files programmatically. The sdformat code has some examples https://bitbucket.org/osrf/sdformat
What is the best way to do this? Is there an example of programmatically generating an SDF?
Is the following the only way to do this?
// Set up a simple sdf model file
std::ostringstream stream;
stream << "<sdf version='1.3'>"
       << "<model name='test_model'>"
       << "  <pose>0 1 2  0 0 0</pose>"
       << "  <static>false</static>"
       << "</model>"
       << "</sdf>";
sdf::SDF sdfParsed;
sdfParsed.SetFromString(stream.str());

I was thinking something like:
sdf::SDFPtr robot(new sdf::SDF());
sdf::init(robot);
robot->root->AddElement("model");

A:

Both of the examples you gave are valid.
Here is the API for SDF elements.
This function has many example uses.
