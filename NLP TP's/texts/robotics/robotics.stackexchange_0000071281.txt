Q:

why do i have to change the environment path every time when i open a new terminal? I am a beginner and now is learning tutorials, Thank you

minphie@Lenovo:~$ rosrun beginner_tutorials add_two_ints_sever
[rospack] Error: package 'beginner_tutorials' not found
As above, I know enter the catkin space and
$ source ./devel/setup.bash
can resolve the problem. But every time when I open a new terminal I have to do this step. Is there another way to solve the problem?

A:

Edit the file ~/.bashrc  and at the end, add the line:
source PATH_TO_YOUR_CATKIN_WS/devel/setup.bash

This way every time you open a new terminal your catkin work space will be properly setup.
