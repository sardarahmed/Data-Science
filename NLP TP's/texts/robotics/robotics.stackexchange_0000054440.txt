Q:

Rosserial Hydro unpack requires string length 4

Hi,I installed rosserial hydro for arduino and ros_lib as written in the wiki. when I try ros hello world example found in ros_lib it compiles and works fine but when i try a ros_lib example with a subscriber, whatever topic name is, i get (from pubsub ros example):
[INFO] [WallTime: 1380287883.995053] ROS Serial Python Node [INFO] [WallTime: 1380287884.001497] Connecting to /dev/ttyACM0 at 57600 baud [INFO] [WallTime: 1380287886.607383] Note: publish buffer size is 512 bytes [INFO] [WallTime: 1380287886.607882] Setup publisher on chatter [std_msgs/String] [ERROR] [WallTime: 1380287886.609524] Creation of subscriber failed: unpack requires a string argument of length 4.
So publisher is created but subscriber fails....! I use hydro on ubuntu 12.04 64bit.Is there a way to solve it?I'm stuck here...!Someone can help me? thank!

A:

I believe it is temporarily broken, but they are at work on fixing it (see https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/76) -- in the meantime, you could do a git checkout, and roll back to the 0.5.2 tag to get back to the working version until a patch is released. In your catkin workspace you would do:
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
git checkout 0.5.2

When I roll back to 0.5.2, the rosserial_xbee gives me the following error: Tried to publish before configured, topic id 125 but it works fine using rosserial_python fine.  I am using the same microcontroller with the same code on it.  However, it works on 0.5.1.  Should I open an issue on GitHub?
