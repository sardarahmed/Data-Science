Q:

ERROR: cannot launch node of type [gmapping/slam_gmapping]: can't locate node [slam_gmapping] in package [gmapping]

This is my first time using ROS. I'm using ubuntu 18.04 and ROS-melodic on my remote (PC) and ROS-kinetic on my turtlebot (pc). I'm trying to run on my Remote (PC)
(roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping)

But I get this error!!!!
process[robot_state_publisher-1]: started with pid [54409]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [gmapping/slam_gmapping]: can't locate node [slam_gmapping] in package [gmapping]
process[rviz-3]: started with pid [54410]
libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
[robot_state_publisher-1] process has finished cleanly

libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile

How can fix this??
Further Work

We tried adding the path of gmapping to the ROS environment to check if it works

```export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/kaos5-q/catkin_ws/src:/home/kaos5-q/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3_msgs:/opt/ros/melodic/share:/home/kaos5-q/catkin_ws/src/slam_gmapping/gmapping```

This is what looks like now!
After I ran, source ~/.bashrc Is this what you mean by sourcing??

Do you have the gmapping package installed?
Comment by turtlebot3 on 2019-01-25:
Yes I have gmapping installed! I believe this is a problem with  Ros/environment variables. Setting a ros path for gmapping. That's my assumption. I'm new to ROS, excuse my ignorance.

How did you install it? From source or using apt?
Comment by turtlebot3 on 2019-01-25:
I installed it from source.
Comment by jayess on 2019-01-25:
Why did you install from source? You should install the binary using apt instead.
Comment by turtlebot3 on 2019-01-25:
I tried at first with the binary using apt but it didn't work. I searched on google why it didn't work and it's because the package has not been released from the melodic release page. I used this website https://answers.ros.org/question/296170/melodic-gmapping/
Comment by jayess on 2019-01-25:
OK, that makes sense then. Are you sourcing the workspace in where the package resides and was compiled?
Comment by turtlebot3 on 2019-01-25:
I've edited my question a little. I tried to source how you said and it still doesn't work. I'm doing something wrong in here.

A:

You should take a look at the catkin tutorials. You need to source your workspace.
I'm assuming that you compiled your workspace using
catkin_make

from the root of your workspace (e.g., ~/catkin_ws).
Anytime that you open a new terminal, you need to source two files: the setup.bash for your ROS distribution and the setup.bash for your workspace. It looks like you've already sourced your distribution's setup.bash, now you just need to do the same for your workspace. Again, assuming that the root of your workspace is at ~/catkin_ws and you are in that directory, then you run
source devel/setup.bash

and then ROS should be able to find your compiled gmapping package and the node(s) that you're using. Now your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable should be set. I've never had to set this on my own.
