Q:

python virtualenvs conflict with kinetic

I set up a virtualenvs for python 3.1 with opencv3. But when I am in the virtual env and execute python import cv2.  Apparently you have to create a link of the 3.1.so file to cv2.so .  I get an error relating to cv2 /opt/ros/kinetic . I do not know why it is looking here? If I uninstall ros then it works fine, no error. Any thoughts.
Update: if I remove the .bashrc source kinetic setup then it also works fine in the virt. What ever the setup is doing is causing a conflict  even when the ros is set up outside the virtual env.

Try this: reinstall opencv3 while in the virtualenvs and specify the target install path to your virtualenvs opencv3 desired directory using CMAKE_INSTALL_PPREFIX=/your/desired/venv/directory

Thanks....I will keep this i mind for future reference. Right now I can use both enviroments by just  commenting on/off the source lines in the .bashrc file.

if false; then
workon cvp3
export OPENCV_VERSION=3
else
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

I am quite curious on this question, could you share more you know, give more instructions.

A:

Right now I can use both environments by just commenting on/off the source lines in the .bashrc file. I am closing this a good enough work around solution.

However if you comment on or off everytime, this means you can not run ROS and your program depend on vitual env simutanously, right?

BTW, if the python is global(which is not your case, but maybe could inspire you)
you don't need to comment on or off, try to add  export $PYTHONPATH with your global python path in ~/.bashrc, as the same time, keep the source line for ros. Then open new terminal, python3, import cv2. It works for m

Thanks for your suggestion ... I no longer have this set up but will keep this solution in mind if I run across this again.
