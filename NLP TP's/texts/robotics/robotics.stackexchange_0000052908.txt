Q:

URDF tutorial probolem

Dear Reader,
I have been trying to work through the tutorials URDF tutorials online and have had a problem with Rviz, It looks nothing like the [tutorial's example](http://     www.ros.org/wiki/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch) and the are a few errors.

Thanks In Advance

A:

Try to set the fixed frame to /base_link or /world if it exists.
Currently it is set to /map which does not exist.
As David Lu wrote in his comment expand the Global Options and double click on /map next to Fixed Frame. There you have to select /base_link. There should be no problem with the VM. The /map frame is the default for rviz, at least for me.
