Q:

How to ssh into turtlebot?

I got my computer for my turtlebot today, and I think (and hope!) I got it set up properly. However, while I was going through the tutorials, I encountered a problem with ssh-ing into my turtlebot. I typed "ssh turtlebot@turtlebot" into my terminal, but it says "ssh: Could not resolve hostname turtlebot: Name or service not known". Is there something I need to know about how to ssh into something? Do I need to type something else into the terminal?

A:

The computer that you're SSHing from needs to know what IP 'turtlebot' refers to is. Try finding the IP of the TurtleBot by running ifconfig in a terminal on the TurtleBot. Then, try:
ssh turtlebot@<IP>

If you are setting up a computer from scratch and are not using the official TurtleBot iso, you may also need to install a server for ssh on your TurtleBot:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

I just checked it is in the ISO.

I don't believe it's in the ISO at the moment.  TIcketed https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/trac/ticket/56

Easiest thing to do would be to run the second line from above to install it - it'll be much faster. I had thought the official distribution had the server installed, but it's possible that it's not included by default.

I was using the official iso, but I did not have an ssh server on the computer. So I may have not downloaded it properly. Can I re load it from the same USB stick?
