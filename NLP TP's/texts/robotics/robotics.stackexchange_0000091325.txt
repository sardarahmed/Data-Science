Q:

The Question is regarding setting up the new workspace in the bashrc file

I had created catkin_ws before and now i have another workspace called my_ws. I have changed the path in the bashrc file to the my_ws and yet whenever i type roscd, it takes me to catkin_ws. Why is that and what needs to be done in order to resolve the issue?
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
#source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
#source /home/yash/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source ~/my_ws/devel/setup.bash
source /home/yash/my_ws/devel/setup.bash

A:

your .bashrc has some duplicates.
It should probaly look something like
...
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/my_ws/devel/setup.bash

As to why roscd still takes you to your old ws, this would happen if you are not using a terminal loaded without the changes in place.  So for the changes you made to take effect you will need to reload .bashrc.
Either open a new terminal and try there.
Or type exec bash into the already open terminal to reload .bashrc.
