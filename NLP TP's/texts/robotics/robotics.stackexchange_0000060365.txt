Q:

How to I fix libgazebo_ros_paths_plugin.so undefined symbol error?

I recently upgraded to the most recent packages of ROS hydro and now when I launch gazebo using "rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo" I'm getting the following error:

gzserver: symbol lookup error:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/libgazebo_ros_paths_plugin.so:
undefined symbol:
_ZN3ros7package10getPluginsERKSsS2_RSt6vectorISsSaISsEE

gzclient: symbol lookup error:
/opt/ros/hydro/lib/libgazebo_ros_paths_plugin.so:
undefined symbol:
_ZN3ros7package10getPluginsERKSsS2_RSt6vectorISsSaISsEE

Using c++filt or http://demangler.com/, I see that the following method is undefined:

ros::package::getPlugins(std::string
const&, std::string const&,
std::vector<std::string,
std::allocatorstd::string >&)

Does anyone know how to fix this?
Here are the ROS / Gazebo packages I have installed on my Ubuntu 12.04.4 64-bit computer:
$ dpkg -l | grep hydro | grep gazebo
ii  ros-hydro-gazebo3-msgs                      2.4.2-3precise                                                          Message and service data structures for interacting with Gazebo from ROS.

Dear liangfok,
I used the same configuration as your system (Ubuntu 12.04+gazebo3+ros-hydro-gazebo3) and sadly got the same error. Still don't know how to get through.
Does anyone help me out of this situation?

My current workaround is to create a script called run_gazebo:
https://bitbucket.org/cfok/hcrl_robot_models/src/23032a61c7299eaead51164eaf2703e0f4ab1868/hcrl_simulator/scripts/run_gazebo?at=develop
The script is started by a launch file:
https://bitbucket.org/cfok/hcrl_robot_models/src/23032a61c7299eaead51164eaf2703e0f4ab1868/stickbot_lowerleg_3dof/launch/gazebo.launch?at=develop
