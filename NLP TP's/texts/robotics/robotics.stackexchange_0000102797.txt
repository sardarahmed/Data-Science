Q:

rqt plugins not working after possible change in python version

When I run any rqt related command( rqt_bag, rqt_image_view), I get the following error:

PluginManager._discover() force discovery of plugins
RospkgPluginProvider._find_plugins() crawling for plugins of type 'qt_gui'
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
I re-installed ros-noetic and the issue didn't go away. Default python version is 3.8.10. I guess I manually removed previous python 2.7 due to some CUDA issue.
Would appreciate any suggestions and help. Thanks!

A:

Got it working.
Probably, some conflict between different installations of pyqt5.
I just typed

pip uninstall pyqt5

on command line.
