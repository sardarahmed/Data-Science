Q:

how to pass argument to executable in launchfile

Want to start a executable within a launchfile which needs an argument (its note a node),
normally i would launch that executable like this from the commandline:
setuart2 on
where "on" is the argument.
I've  put the executable into a scriptfolder into the workspace and am starting it like that in the launchfile:

, seems that it is found through the launchfile, but i get the following error (what is clear, because the parameter "on" is missing:
killing on exit
remote[robotOS.local-0]: /home/robot/ROS-Groovy-Workspace/src/base_controller/scripts/setuart2: either 'on' or 'off' argument is required
Now i've found no way to pass the parameter, tryed it throug parameters, but no success.
Can somebody help?
Thx a lot
Fabian

A:

Try using the args property:
<node name="setuart2" pkg="base_controller" type="setuart2" args="on"/>

But also note that roslaunch assumes that any nodes listed are ROS nodes, and silently passes additional __name and __log parameters to your program (which ROS nodes handle correctly).

Hi, thanks for having a look, allready tried with args, but no success. Still getting error:
/home/robot/ROS-Groovy-Workspace/src/base_controller/scripts/setuart2: either 'on' or 'off' argument is required

maybe i just try writing a scriptfile which passes the argument correct and trying to execute that script instead...

Your program is probably confused by the __name and __log options I mentioned. Try writing a ROS node which calls your program.
