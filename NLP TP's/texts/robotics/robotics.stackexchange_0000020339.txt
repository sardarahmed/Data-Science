Q:

How do "process gain" and "proportional gain" affect the Steady State Error in a PID Controlled machine?

I came across this doubt while reading the Wikipedia page on PID Control. The section on Steady-state error states: 

Steady-state error (SSE) is proportional to the process gain and
  inversely proportional to proportional gain.

First of all I'm not able to understand what "process gain" actually means and how it differs from proportional gain. Secondly, I can't understand the relation between SSE and the two gains. 
PS. I haven't taken a formal course on Control Systems and I'm just a hobbyist trying to make a PID controlled line follower at home. So, it might be the case that I've totally missed something important.

A:

To understand this, take a look at this image, also from the Wikipedia article:

The “process gain” is not part of your PID controller. Rather, it is a representation of what is actually happening in your process. Consider a heater control. The signal you are measuring is temperature, but the output of your controller would be something to turn your heater on and off (perhaps a pulse width modulation duty cycle). The “process gain” is simply a mathematical representation of how the actual temperature responds to what your heater is doing. 
The article is saying that steady state error gets bigger if the process gain gets bigger, but gets smaller as you turn up the proportional gain in your PID controller.
