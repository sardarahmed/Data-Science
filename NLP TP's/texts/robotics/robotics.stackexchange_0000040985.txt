Q:

Sick TiM300 Laserscanner Driver

Hey there,
is there a Sick TiM300 Laserscanner Driver for ROS available? It is a relatively new and tiny Laserscanner connected via USB. So far, I only found http://www.ros.org/wiki/sicktoolbox, but I think this one is for the big older ones with ethernet connection.
A friend of mine got a driver, but only for Player/Stage (which seems to be inactive since 2 years). If there is no solution for ROS yet, I would try to convert this driver to use it in ROS. But as I have no experience in ROS so far, I would be very happy if someone could give me a hint where to find a driver or at least give me some useful information on how to integrate the old player/stage driver into the sicktoolbox, e.g.
Thanks!

A:

Yes, the guys from the University of Osnabr√ºck recently published a TIM3XX driver. It is available here: http://kos.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/sick_tim3xx.git
I just tested it today and it works out of the box. Unlike the hokuyo scanners it does not use a symmetric min/max angle however and the "middle" of the scan thus coincides with the y axis of the scanner coordinate frame.
