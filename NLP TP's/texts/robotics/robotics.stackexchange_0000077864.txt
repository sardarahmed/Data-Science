Q:

Info source in new package release e-mail summary

Out of curiousity, e.g. New Packages for Jade and Kinetic 2016-12-15,

Where are "contributors" taken from? Doesn't look like all the maintainers listed for moveit metapackage for Kinetic are enlisted.
How is package categorized as "added" or "updated"? MoveIt! for Kinetic has never been publicly synced until this time of sync IMO, but it's in "updated package" category.

UPDATE: thanks for taking a look @ahendrix, but in any previous release note moveit has not been included for kinetic (2016-10-24, 2016-10-04). And now I'm the one of a few who run bloom for moveit so I've been paying attention :) . During soak period we bumped versions a few times.

The sync data shows that the public version was updated: ros-kinetic-moveit: 0.9.1-2 -> 0.9.3-0

The GBP repo for moveit also shows multiple previous releases into kinetic: https://github.com/ros-gbp/moveit-release

A:

The report is generated from diffing the debian repositories. The implementation is here: https://goo.gl/kczVY7  Debian control files only support a single maintainer: https://goo.gl/swhwpO so we only get the first maintainer listed at this stage.

That explains for the fewer maintainers listed in the release report. What  about my other question?

Same answer. The output of that script for each sync is here: http://build.ros.org:8080/job/Krel_sync-packages-to-main/ I just copy and paste for the announcement.
