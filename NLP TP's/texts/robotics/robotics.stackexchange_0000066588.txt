Q:

No kinect2 devices found!

I am unable to open kinect2, neither with rosrun kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge  nor with roslaunch kinect2_bridge.launch, the output is always the same:
[Freenect2Impl] enumerating devices... [Freenect2Impl] 18 usb devices connected [Freenect2Impl] failed to open Kinect v2 @4:5! [Freenect2Impl] found 0 devices Error: no Kinect2 devices found!
