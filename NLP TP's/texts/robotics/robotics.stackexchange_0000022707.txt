Q:

Does full motor current pass through 'switches' on children's driving vehicles?

I plan to hijack a powerwheels-like toy to control it with the jetson nano.  Here is the toy:

I want to keep it ultra simple so my idea is to just take off the 'handles'(levers) and hook the wires to two relays controlled by the Jetson.
What I do not understand is if the full 30amp current goes through these wires, so that I would need heavy duty relays, or if some little relays than just take like up to 10amps are fine since it's just a 'switch'.

A:

So the answer is that indeed, the motor current wires are exactly the same wires wired into the switches:

This is apparently the univerally most common way these things are wired, and it would be good for people on this robotics site to be aware of that.
I hope this future robotics prototypers hooking up computers to these toys.  My 10-amp relays have not burned out yet, though I have no  idea how much current they get when eg the toy is pushing against a wall.
