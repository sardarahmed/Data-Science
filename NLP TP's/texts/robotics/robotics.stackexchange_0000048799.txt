Q:

how to localize kinect in pre_saved pcd map?

I have been able to successfully install and run ccny_rgbd and save out a pcd map.
I can also see the map using pcd_viewer.
Can someone tell me the steps to then localize the kinect "within" a saved map?
ie. now that I have a map, what are the steps for the kinect to localize within it and once it does, how can I visualize both in rviz?
Thanks,
-Scott

Are there plans to enhance the stack to support navigation in a map that ccny_rgbd has captured? Or is there a way to do this via exporting it as an octomap or some other way you could suggest?

The support to export an Octomap is there (it's not exported continuously though, you must call a service). We are working on localization, but other navigation features (path-planning, obstacle avoidance) will be outside the scope of this package

Thank you for your comments. I was able to export the map as an octomap and will attempt to use that and localize a kinect within it using humanoid_localization stack. Thanks again. the ccny_rgbd is a fantastic package. Good luck.

No problem, glad you find it useful. If you ever have time, send me a screenshot of your octomap :)

A:

the functionality to localize on a pre-existing map does not currently exist in ccny_rgbd, but might exist using other tools
