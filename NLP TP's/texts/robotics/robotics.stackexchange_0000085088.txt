Q:

dynamixel_controller manager wrong package prefix

Hello,
I'm working with the dynamixel MX-64AT servos.
Using a Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic version 1.12.12
Up until now I had no problem to get them up and running. Then I switched computers and now I get an error message whenever I try to start the controller_manager. Weirdly this problem now also occurs on the computer that up until now I had never had any troubles with.
Basically the error can be reproduced when following this tutorial : http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/ConnectingToDynamixelBus
I do have the baud rate and id set to the right values and also checked that the USB port has the correct read and write permissions.
Also I read that it could be related to faulty cables, but I also changed all of them several times, so that shouldn't be the problem.
Whenever I try to execute roslaunch my_dynamixel_tutorial controller_manager.launch I get these error messages saying something about a invalid response and wrong prefix error.

Weirdly enough, sometimes it will still recognize both motors and be able to work with them.
To me it sounds a bit as if something with the communication is going wrong, but to be honest I can't figure out, where it's going wrong. I would appreciate any help.
Best Regards,
B.

Hello :)
ROBOTIS provides official opensource repository as ROBOTIS-GIT?
In this repository, you can find Dynamixel-Workbench to control all series of DYNAMIXELS. Because it is official package for DYNAMIXEL, you can get a proper solution when you faced some problems.
This is WIKI page for DYNAMIXEL and introduced packages.
WIKI for DYNAMIXEL
WIKI for Dynamixel-Workbench
Enjoy with it!

I believe that this should be a comment instead of an answer as this doesn't answer the question. Instead, it just points to a wiki and GitHub repo.

Hello,
my problem is, that it did work well for a while and I have some work already done in the old framework. If possible I would like to avoid redoing all that work to be compatible to the new package.
Comment by Cataglyphis on 2018-02-22:
In particular with the old package it was very easy to control 3 servos. I tried the workbench, but in the tutorials it only describes working with 2 servos and I couldn't find a way to generalize this to 3 or more motors without rewriting big chunks of the code, following a trail of libraries etc.
Comment by Darby Lim on 2018-03-19:
The new version of Dynamixel supports 3 or more motors connect in tutorial.
You can download in github (not apt-get install)

Thanks for the tip, I will look into it
