Q:

What is the meaning of MoveBase::distance?

I am sorry for my poor English.
I am a beginner at ROS and ROS navigation stack. I would like to know what double MoveBase::distance(const geometry_msgs::PoseStamped& p1, const geometry_msgs::PoseStamped& p2) means , which is a function in move_base.cpp. Does it mean the distance from a present point to a goal point?
In addition, I would also like to know the meaning of geometry_msgs::PoseStamped. Is it a self position?
I would appreciate it if you could answer my question.
Thank you.

According to the code, that method calculates the Euclidian distance between p1 and p2. So not necessarily a goal.

In addition, I would also like to know the meaning of geometry_msgs::PoseStamped. Is it a self position?

p1 and p2 could be any point.
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped is a message in the geometry_msgs pkg, and those can be used to represent arbitrary poses in a Cartesian coord system, relative to some origin.

Thank you for answering my question.
Thanks for your clear explanation, I understood that the function is for calculating the Euclidian distance between p1 and p2 ,which are arbitrary points.
Please excuse any mistakes I have made in this letter.
Thank you so much for your lucid instructions.
