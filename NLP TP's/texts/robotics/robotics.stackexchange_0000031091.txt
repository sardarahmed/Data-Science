Q:

household_database visualization

Hi all,
I am trying to visualize with rviz the objects triangle mesh stored in the database. I call the household database GetModelMesh service and I put the returned points in a Marker for rviz visualization. I have noticed that every time I call the service GetModelMesh the value for mesh type is 0 which should be sphere. If I send the mesh vertices extracted to rviz and I set the marker type as sphere I always get the same sphere shape. Maybe I am missing something. How can I save the triangle mesh in a marker? It is correct that I get always a 0 as type from the GetModelMesh even if I change the object Id?
Thanks

A:

If you just want to see them you can try spawning the objects in gazebo.
I have urdfs for them here:

make sure to turn off shadows in gazebo though - you might get an error similar to this:

Here are also some useful RVIZ markers (which you have probably seen already)

Also, the fact that the returned shape type is always 0 is a bug, which has been fixed for upcoming releases. The type should be 3, for MESH.
