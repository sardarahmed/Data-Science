Q:

Powering 6 servomotors requiring 6V and 2A each

The title pretty much says it all.  I'm on a team that is currently building a robotic arm for the capstone project of my engineering degree, our design is similar to the Dobot (5 degrees of freedom). We purchased our 6 servomotors, and each one requires 2A at 6V.  
From my preliminary research, I haven't been able to find a power source that could satisfy this.  We'd rather not purchase six individual AC/DC power source for each servo, and we've heard that these can introduce problems, as they aren't necessarily voltage-regulated.  Another suggestion we've received is to buy a computer power source, and modify it to output our the voltage and amperage we need. This raises some concerns, since our professor running the course might find this dangerous.
We'd like some input into how we can power our servos effectively, without going overboard on costs (we are students, after all).
Thanks!

A:

Search aliexpress for '6V switching power supply'. You should find 5Amp or 10Amp ones for $10-$20. Silver boxes with holes in them. You can find them on ebay as well (usually the same chinese vendors as aliexpress).
You will need to add your own AC plug.
Keep in mind that you will probably not be using 12Amps because not all motors will be at full torque at the same time.
