Edit: Hello Janidu
I used  quite a  long time  where  exactly  I can find these option  to  solve this  problem .Yes  It  will  not be automatically  saved  Markers  pose.I have  to  give  command or  time steps  to save my Markers Pose
I means  How  Can I  do that.
I  carefully checked Rviz  user  manual and other options  but  did  not find yet the way to  save  pose results  in text file or  any  format.
Would  you mind to give  link or  any thing that  I  should maintain. I  am  using  ROS  Indigo.

You can't do it in Rviz. Simple as that. Identify what data you want to save first. Then identify which topics these data are published to. Then save it to a rosbag or pipe as Felix has said. I hope it's clear?

A:

Rviz just displays results, right? I don't think it computes those results by itself (please correct me if I'm wrong). So what you can do is, finding out the topics that publish your marker poses and record them in rosbags.
