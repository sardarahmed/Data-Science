A:

Unfortunately, there is currently a problem with the released octovis package: The dependencies are just wrong. This will be resolved once the build server catches up and the newest version becomes available.
Until that time you can either build octovis from source or install the correct version from here:
http://50.28.27.175/repos/building/pool/main/r/ros-fuerte-octovis/
Pick your right Ubuntu version and x86 or 64 bit, download the .deb file and run
sudo dpkg -i ros-fuerte-octovis_1.4.2-4*.deb

on it.
Sorry for the trouble!
