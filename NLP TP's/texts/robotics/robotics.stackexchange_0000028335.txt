Q:

Move to point in Gazebo environment

I have a custom robot model in Gazebo connected with ROS. I want to make it move to point in gazebo environment. I have searched a lot but found only for specific robots, or for real robots, and nothing works. Is there some plugin that would work in my URDF?
Any advice will help!
Thank you!
