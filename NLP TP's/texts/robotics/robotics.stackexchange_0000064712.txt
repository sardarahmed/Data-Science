Q:

vicon with ROS INDIGO

Hi,
I have recently upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 meaning an upgrade from ROS fuerte to ROS indigo. Unfortunately, the vicon_bridge package is failing to compile. One of the ‘tf_cb_' error messages is
../../vicon_bridge/src/tf_distort.cpp:154:6: error: ‘tf_cb_’ was not declared in this scope
if(tf_cb_.connected())
Is there a fix for this problem? Are there any plans getting vicon_bridge to work with ROS indigo? If not, are there alternative packages to vicon_bridge that can get vicon messages into 'tf' message type?
Regards,
Moses.

A:

The vicon_bridge in the ethz-asl/vicon_bridge repository (which seems like a stand-alone repository for just vicon_bridge, which was originally here) compiles for me under Indigo.
Note: I have not tested whether it actually works (but I assume it does).

Thanks. I can confirm to you that I have compiled and tested the latest vicon_bridge and it worked.

FYI - Thanks for the link however, the ROS site does not have the most recent catkinized vicon_bridge node link, this is why I could not find it.

Please don't take my answer on catkin 'ized' Vicon Package as criticism, I'm merely trying to avoid posting the same information multiple times by refering people to older answers.
