Q:

Calling Global Localization Service in C++

Hi all.  I have found documentation on calling ros services using ros::service::call but I cannot figure out how to tell it I would like to call the /global_localization service that AMCL provides.
ros::service:call("/global_localization", ???)

What goes in place of the ???
I am working on a program that sends goals to the robot (using the /map frame) and I would like to call the service and have the robot drive around until it is localized instead of using RVIZ to give it a pose estimate manually.  I know that I can use rosservice call /global_localization but I would like to do it programmatically if at all possible.

A:

rosservice type /global_localization will give you the service type to fill in there.
You can lookup the contents of the request in the API description.
