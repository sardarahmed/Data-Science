Question about Tutorial : Introduction to Stage Controllers - stageros problem

HI i'm ROS newbie.
I just follow the tutorial about Introduction to Stage Controllers : link text
I achieved first two commands : "rosmake stage_controllers" and "rospack find stage_controllers"
But I have a problem at the next step.
I typed "rosrun stage stageros rospack find stage_controllers/world/roomba-wander.world" into the terminal
and the terminal show me "[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named stageros below /opt/ros/hydro/share/stage"
Of course I started with roscore.
I don't get why.
plz somebody help me....

A:

I think the wiki might be outdated... If you're using hydro or indigo, you need to run:
$ rosrun stage_ros stageros `rospack find stage_controllers`/world/rooma-wander.world

I am not entirely familiar with the use of stage_controllers, but I think the syntax should be fine. Also, if you want an example of a roslaunch file, here is an example for the p2os stack.

Update roslaunch files to <node pkg="stage_ros" type="stageros" . Related:
