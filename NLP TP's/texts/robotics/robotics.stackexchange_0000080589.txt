A:

The command that you are trying to run installs dependencies of the sound_play package. To figure out what those dependencies are, your system needs to be able to find the package.xml for the sound_play package. So you need to have that package on your machine somewhere. You should be able to type sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-sound-play to install the package from apt-get. Then the above command should work.
Alternatively, you could have a copy of the source code for the sound_play package in a workspace, and have sourced the setup.bash file for that workspace. Then rosdep would use the package.xml located in your workspace instead of the one in /opt/ros/indigo/share.
Note there are many other questions with this same issue on answers.ros.org, these would have been a good place to start. E.g.:
