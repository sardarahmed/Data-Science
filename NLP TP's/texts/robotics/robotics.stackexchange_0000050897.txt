Q:

Add additional packages to catkin_ws?

I've been working on getting ROS Groovy on a BeagleBone. Following the instructions on installing Groovy from source (http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Source) (there are a few errors in this) I can build the catkin workspace with different variants just fine.
As I only need the BeagleBone for interfacing sensors remotely to my ROS PC I'm working mainly with the bare bones variant (ROS-Comm). I tried the Robot variant as it has the additional packages I need but there are erros with collada (and I don't need collada and several other packages that come with Robot so I'm starting with ROS-Comm).
Now my question: After the catkin workspace is built, how do you build new packages into the existing catkin ws?

A:

Add them to the src/ subdirectory and re-run catkin_make.

It appears these can be added after the variant and before rosdep, or after rosdep as well (but does rosdep need to be run again??).

@TJump if you have new packages then they might have new system dependencies, so yes you need to run rosdep... Otherwise their dependencies might not be met and their build might fail.

The other thing you can do is create another catkin workspace on top of the current workspace you have. This might be more efficient depending on your use case.
