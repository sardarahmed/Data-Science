Q:

Methods of visualization_msgs/MarkerArray

Where can I find a complete documentation of visualization_msgs/MarkerArray? I m interested in methods of visualization_msgs/MarkerArray.

Also as it is an array so I assume that it will contain only 1 type of Marker, right?

A:

You can find the documentation here: http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/visualization_msgs/html/msg/MarkerArray.html
As you can see, it is just an array of http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/visualization_msgs/html/msg/Marker.html

They can be of different type, because the different types all use the same class, as you can see from the previous link.

You can also find more info here https://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker and here https://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers:%20Basic%20Shapes

Thanks ct2034,
Thanks for your reply.

The sources you shared does not talk about any methods of visualization_msgs/MarkerArray.
So, it id clear that the array can contain any type marker.

That's probably because they do not have methods. These message types, as all ROS message types, are only containers for data. So you will have to assign values to them directly and then publish them. For example marker.pose.position.x = 99

Will you take a look at line #41 of code given [link text]. (http://docs.ros.org/en/fuerte/api/rviz/html/marker__array__test_8py_source.html)
The code uses append() method. There are many such examples.

Okay, sorry. Anything that is defined as an array in the msg file (like Marker[] markers here) will be converted to a std::vector<Marker> in c++ (see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector for their methods).
There are some other specialities about messages that you can find here: http://wiki.ros.org/action/show/msg?action=show#Fields

Thanks @ct2034, this is what I needed. It is very useful information and is not provided in the official documentation.
