Q:

gazebo_gui-3 error when starting gazebo with roslaunch

Hey
I have this problem that's happening more often the whole last week when starting gazebo using roslaunch, I haven't installed any updates though.
Is there any permanent solution for it because it so annoying not to start gazebo right away and it works only after 5 to 6 times attempts
The system: gazebo 1.9.1, groovy, gazebo_ros_package
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[gazebo_gui-3] process has died [pid 16577, exit code 139, cmd /home/zahraa/catkin_ws/src/gazebo_ros_pkgs/gazebo_ros/scripts/gzclient __name:=gazebo_gui __log:=/home/zahraa/.ros/log/4139ed3a-13e2-11e3-9765-6c626d02622d/gazebo_gui-3.log].
log file: /home/zahraa/.ros/log/4139ed3a-13e2-11e3-9765-6c626d02622d/gazebo_gui-3*.log

I tried to find the error by going to  4139ed3a-13e2-11e3-9765-6c626d02622d
but this directory doesn't not have gazebo_gui-3*.log  file and  it has other log files such as spawn_urdf.log and master.log etc..
thanks in advance!

A:

solved by starting gazebo client in another terminal after sourcing  . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
and rosrun gazebo_ros gzclient
