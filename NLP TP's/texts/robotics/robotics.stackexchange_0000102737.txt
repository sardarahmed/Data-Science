Q:

Setting up Nav2 on real robot

Hi community,
I'm working on building my own SLAM robot as an educational project, and I've been following along the excellent guide on setting up Nav2. I'm a bit stuck, and here's why:
My robot is running a Raspberry Pi 4 (Ubuntu 22.04) headlessly, but the Nav2 setup guide assumes (or maybe requires? I'm not sure) the use of Gazebo. I made it from the beginning all the way through the URDF set up section, but starting from the Setting Up Odometry it gets a bit Gazebo-heavy.
I'd appreciate some help with regards to either:

Knowing which parts of the tutorial(s) to ignore (since I'm not using sim) without skipping critical steps in getting my real robot moving
Using a different guide (if there exists one) that is less sim-oriented and more geared toward setting up a physical robot with Nav2

Thanks in advance and huge kudos to everyone making Nav2 happen!!

A:

I have found this course on YouTube by Articulated Robotics to be extremely helpful in getting things running on a physical robot, not only nav2 but also slam_toolbox and more. Huge props to the creator.
