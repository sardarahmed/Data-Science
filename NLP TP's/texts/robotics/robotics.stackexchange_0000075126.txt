Q:

Install library in ros

I am wondering how I would incorporate a library in ROS. The library I am trying to install is called ulapi to communicate with the kuka robot we have in the lab.
Thanks
Update (7.13.16):
Here is part of my code that I am trying to add the ulapi library. Might be useful.
#include <ros/ros.h>

//library for type of message sent to gazebo topics
#include <std_msgs/Float64.h>

//libraries to control model in gazebo
#include <geometry_msgs/Pose.h>
#include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h>
#include <gazebo_msgs/ModelState.h>
#include <gazebo_msgs/SetModelState.h>

#include <cstdlib>
#include <robsim_gazebo/ulapi.h>

int main (int argc, char** argv)
{
    //initialize node
    ros::init(argc, argv, "publisher_node");

    //create node handle
    ros::NodeHandle rob_pose;

    ros::NodeHandle a1a2;
    ros::NodeHandle a2e1;
    ros::NodeHandle e1a3;
    ros::NodeHandle a3a4;
    ros::NodeHandle a4a5;
    ros::NodeHandle a5a6;
    ros::NodeHandle a6tp;

Here is the part of my CMakeLists.txt file
add_library(unix_ulapi src/unix_ulapi.c)
#target_link_libraries(publisher_node unix_ulapi)

add_library(ulapi_getopt src/ulapi_getopt.c)
#target_link_libraries(publisher_node ulapi_getopt)

Are you just asking how to install the library (.so file) in some specific location, or do you want to integrate the library into a ROS node? The fist is a file copy action, the second requires you program a node (a C++ program fi) and call into the libraries functions.

The files I have are C and H. I am use to installing libraries for Arduino and was wondering how to do it for ROS.

After adding the libraries you need to link them to the executable.
Try to uncomment the target_link_libraries() lines or add the next line at the bottom of the CMakeList:
target_link_libraries(publisher_node ulapi_getotp unix_ulapi)

When I do that I get an error that says this:
CMake Error at robsim/robsim_gazebo/CMakeLists.txt:214 (target_link_libraries):
        Cannot specify link libraries for target "publisher_node" which is not
        built by this project.

off-topic, but what I find much more interesting: what are you doing with robsim, gazebo and ulapi? :)

This is because the executable has another name.
Try replacing publisher_node with the name of the executable.
If you can show us the complete CMakeList we can help you  better ;)

A:

Can you be more specific about "install" ?
Check the library with cmake then compile your code and link it
This is just a sample, modify regarding to your needs
find_package( PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_check_modules( ulapi REQUIRED ulapi )

add_executable( my_exec src/my_source.cpp )
target_link_libraries( my_exec ${ulapi_LIBRARIES} )

What I mean by install is that I want to use the .c and .h files from ulapi (which is what we use to talk to the robot arms we have in the lab) in my c++ code I have written. I am familiar with the way you install libraries for arduino if that is of any help.
