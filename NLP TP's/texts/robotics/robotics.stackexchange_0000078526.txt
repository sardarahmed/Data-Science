Q:

Building Orocos Components in ROS Kinetic

My system has used rtt_ros_integration in the past to build Orocos Components in a ROS Package in ROS Indigo. We are trying to update our systems to ROS Kinetic. I can't find an rtt_ros_integration like package that would work in ROS Kinetic, is one being developed?

A:

Use rtt_ros_integration package with branch 2.9 from github. This will work like a charm.  follow the instructions as it is. but before that also instal ruby, gems and ruby-dev packages. if u want corba support than when building orocos_package inside underlay_isolate pakage use catkin_make_isolated --install -DCORBA ...
