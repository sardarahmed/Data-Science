Q:

Cannot clone a package from github (publickey)

I want to do eye-to-hand using the following package https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/hand_eye_calibration/hand_eye_calibration_tutorial.html , however when I am cloning the git repository I am getting this error
git clone git@github.com:ros-planning/moveit_calibration.git
Cloning into 'moveit_calibration'...
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

A:

Thank you ! I followed the following commands to add public ssh key to my github
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your email id "
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add

Open VS Code and copy ssh
cd ~/.ssh
code .

login into github 
go to setting 
go to ssh and gp keys
add new key 
paste it
