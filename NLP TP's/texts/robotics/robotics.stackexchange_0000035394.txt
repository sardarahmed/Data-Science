Q:

generating versioned rosinstall file from currnt workspace

Hi
Is there any tool that is able to dump rosinstall with version tag from current workspace or .rosinstall file?
For example, I have following .rosinstall for my application,
http://code.google.com/p/rtm-ros-robotics/source/browse/trunk/agentsystem_ros_tutorials/rtm-ros-robotics.rosinstall
for developers to work against the trunk repositories. Then, Jenkins/Hudson server check the
build status and add the latest tag.
I would be very happy if I can freeze this set as a .rosinstall file with version tag in all repositories  so that I can commit the file to as a stable.rosinstall file  and users always be able to setup with stable set of repository versions.

Have you tried the rosinstall argument?
--generate-versioned-rosinstall=GENERATE_VERSIONED
                    generate a versioned rosinstall file
