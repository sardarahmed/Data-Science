Q:

How to run same pakcage twice at the same time?

Hi
im currently running the sicktoolbox_wrapper package for the LMS200 for scanning purpose
I have two LMS200 and would like to use them at the same time
I know the connecting port which are ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1
lets say im running in port ttyUSB0
when i execute the command of
rosparam set /sicklms/port /dev/ttyUSB1
rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms
the old one is killed because of

[new node registered with the same
name]

is there any possible way to change the node name before executing it?
or is it possible to copy and paste then reinstall the same package with a different and publishing a different node name?
I am trying rosparam set but have not found a clue yet
plx help

A:

See this answer, it shows how to set the node name both from the command line and from launch files.

let me make it clear
if i execute
rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms __name:=sicklms
it is executable but doesnt change anything
if i execute this
rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms __name:=sicklms2
i have
[ERROR] [1397226096.240203952]: Initialize failed! are you using the correct device path?
:/

i just found that if i do
rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms __name:=sicklms2
it says
attempting to open devic @ /dev/lms200
which is a path that i never told the computer to do

This is probably the default value. You will need to set the parameter rosparam set /sicklms2/port /dev/ttyUSB1 when you run rosrun sicktoolbox_wrapper sicklms __name:=sicklms2. It is probably best if you create a launch file for your nodes.
