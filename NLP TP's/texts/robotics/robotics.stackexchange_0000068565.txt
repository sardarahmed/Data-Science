Q:

catkin build autocompletion

Hello everyone. This is not an urgent issue, but is quite annoying at time. So, the problem is the following. I am using the python catkin_tools instead of ordinary catkin_make in ros indigo. When I do:
catkin build [tab][tab]

I expect to have the completions of the packages currently in the workspace to pop up, but this is not happening. I am not 100% sure, but I guess I had the indended behaviour before. Instead I get
catkin build usage: catkin [-h] [-a] [--test-colors]
          [build | clean | config | create | init | list | profile] ...
catkin: error: unrecognized arguments: --no-color --unformatted --quiet
usage: catkin [-h] [-a] [--test-colors]
              [build | clean | config | create | init | list | profile] ...
catkin: error: unrecognized arguments: --no-color --unformatted --quiet

So the question is - where should I look for it? Any pointer appreciated. Thanks!

Hmm. It works for me. Not sure what I did or installed to enable it.

@joq, it has been working for me for quite a while too, but then I missed the moment when it stopped. So the intention behind this question is to find if somebody else had the same issue, or, at least to find somebody who just knows more than I do.

Did you install a new version? Looks like I have 0.3.0.
Comment by niosus on 2015-07-14:
oh, @joq, I didn't realize it has been updated. Did an upgrade - this solved the issue. I will point to your comment in a solution. Thanks.

A:

As pointed out in one of the comments by @joq - I have been using catking tools 0.2.0, while there has been an update to 0.3.0. After performing:
sudo pip install --upgrade catkin_tools 

the issue has disappeared. Thanks!
