Q:

Is the Prop Shop website down?

The link to the Prop Shop website listed on the Gazebo homepage: https://thepropshop.org/ seems to be dead. I have noticed this a couple of days ago. Websites like Uptrends also report that the site is unreachable. Is this just a temporary interruption?

Hi, there is active work happening on The Propshop, but the website is not functional yet.

Ok, thanks for the info! Are you wit the development team? Maybe it would be a good idea to put up a temporary page with this info, in stead of the page just timing out.

Thanks, the propshop links have been removed from the gazebo web site. We'll work on a landing page soon.
