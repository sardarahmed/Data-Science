Q:

pointCloud2 to pointCloud

Hi
I am using the pointcloud assembler in the laser_assembler package, unfortunately the package can only assemble pointclouds which are pointcloud1
The kinect i am using only publishes pointcloud2
Does anyone know how to convert pointCloud2 into pointcloud?

A:

I use this http://www.ros.org/wiki/point_cloud_converter
You could look at the source to see if there's any change needed for Fuerte or Groovy (probably not, since it's mostly data copying)

Hi i found  the package sensor_msg http://ros.org/wiki/sensor_msgs there is a fuction in the code api which does pointcloud conversion, but i am not sure how to access the static function http://www.ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/namespacesensor__msgs.html#ab3bdbe5a82173d3483899c776e6ccbab i

You can always search for the function and see if others have used it. And follow how it is done. I would suggest using the point_cloud_converter node instead if you don't really need to know the nitty gritty.
