Q:

Best sensor to determine "up" versus "down"

I want to start designing an Arduino project and have telemetry readings that indicate tilt or angle of placement. 
Would an accelerometer be the best for determining tilt? Are there good tutorials? 

A:

if you aren't moving, the accelerometer will give you the direction of gravity. if you are moving and hoping to use this orientation data for control you'll need to incorporate at least one more sensor. The extra sensor is needed because you have no method separating the acceleration of gravity and the acceleration of the sensor. The other drawback is that the accelerometer has no way to measure heading. 
A magnetometer would also give you a measurement of orientation but the calibration process can be a little intimidating. It makes up for the deficiencies of the accel.
If you're looking for a weekend project I recommend using a three axis accelerometer.
