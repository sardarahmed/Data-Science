Q:

ROS Diamondback on Ubuntu 64 bit

Hi,
using Ubuntu 64 Bit instead of Ubuntu 32 Bit would give some benefits (e.g. you can use more then 8 cpu cores). Is it possible to run Diamondback under Ubuntu 64 Bit? Do most stacks (e.g. ccny_vision) work under 64 Bit Ubuntu? If it is possible at all: Does anyone have experience if it is possible to use Ros and Ubuntu 64 Bit without having much trouble?
Regards,
Bastian

A:

I've been running ROS on various 64-bit Ubuntu systems for years without any problems. Diamondback (or Electric, or C-turtle) will work fine on any supported Ubuntu version. All the build tests are run continuously in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes.
