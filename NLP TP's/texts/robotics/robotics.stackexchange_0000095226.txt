Q:

Where should questions about index.ros.org be posted?

The Github repository has disabled the Issues tab.
Should ROS Discourse be used instead?
Or here, on ROS Answers?

A:

As always questions should be asked here on answers.ros.org
The repository you have linked to contains 100% auto-generated content. If you want to make a bug report (about the structure or generation and not content) or feature request of the site it can be filed on rosindex
Any content specific issues should be filed with the package from which the data is aggregated.

I only now found this page, which includes a link to github/ros-infrastructure/rosindex. It's a bit hidden, and there is a much more prominent link at the bottom left of each page with a Github icon and a ros-infrastructure label. That's how I arrived at github/ros-infrastructure/index.ros.org.
