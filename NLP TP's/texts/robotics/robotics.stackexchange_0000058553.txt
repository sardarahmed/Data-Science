Q:

Turtlebot 3dSensor.Launch cannot find kinect as if it is not plugged in?

Hello, I recently upgraded my Turtlebot from groovy to hydro, and am now trying to subscribe to the kinect data.  However, when I launch the 3dsensor.launch startup file, I get the following error:
No devices connected ... waiting for devices to be connected.
Everything else works fine, except that the Turtlebot cannot seem to find the kinect, despite the fact that the kinect is definitely plugged in.  Anyone know what the problem could be?

@randylewis7: Could you check next items?

You plug your kinect to USB 2.0 on turtlebot PC.
There are two yaml file (depth_.yaml, rgb_.yaml) in ~/.ros/camera_info.

I'm sorry but I don't understand what you're asking. about the yaml files.  THe kinect is plugged in correctly but I can't find any directory called .ros/camera_info

@randylewis7: Do you put the command cd ~/.ros and  ls  on a terminal? If you can't see the directory  camera_info , I think you can do a calibration for kinect. Did you receive some message except for No devices connected ... ?

I can check if I receive any messges in case that there is not camera_info. That means removing my camera_info folder. So I will do that if you wait for me.

@randylewis7: I'm sorry. I checked that, [WARN] happens ,but the error didn't happens. I could look at a image on Rviz. I guess that you miss installing. I have experienced the error at the early version of groovy. When I reinstall ROS, I also reinstall Ubuntu OS. I like Ubuntu 12.04.

Hi.
I had a similar problem after updating Ubuntu (13.04) in my PC.
I'm not sure what happened, but I had to reinstall the kinect driver:
I download this:
https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
And in the "Bin" folder, I extract "SensorKinect093-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1" and install it (by running the install.sh)
I hope that could work for you as well!

I tried this but it didn't seem to affect the error at all.

The only thing I've done that affected the error so far was to reinstall hydro on both the turtlebot and the workstation computer, which changed the error in that when running 3dsensor.launch, it waits till the end to say no devices are connected, rather than saying it every so often while launching other processes and then at the end.

Could incompatible versions of ROS be the problem, or do you think it's something else?
