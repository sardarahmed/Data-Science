Q:

Installing freenect_stack from source

I downloaded the source code for freenect_stack from git to the src folder of my catkin workspace. When I tried to build it using catkin_make, I got the following error:
*-- +++ processing catkin package: 'freenect_camera'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(freenect_stack/freenect_camera)
*CMake Error at /home/ubuntu/ros_catkin_ws/devel/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_info_manager" with any of the following names:
    camera_info_managerConfig.cmake
    camera_info_manager-config.cmake*
  Add the installation prefix of "camera_info_manager" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "camera_info_manager_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "camera_info_manager" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed* 

What is the camera_info_make config file? And how do I get it?

A:

camera_info_manager is a ROS package on which freenect_stack depends. You need to either install it on your system or add it to your catkin workspace.
To install on Ubuntu for Groovy:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-camera-info-manager

If you decide not to build freenect_stack yourself, you can install it similarly:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-freenect-stack

Note: the freenect_camera package has other dependencies you will probably also need for building freenect_stack.
