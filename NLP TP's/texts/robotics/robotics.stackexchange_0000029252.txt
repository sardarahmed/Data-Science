Q:

Question about initial_position in Fortress

I'm trying to figure how to have an initial position without change the system or position coordination.
I originally thought <initial_position> would do the trick in joint_controller, but it doesn't do anything.
What is other way to load the initial position? I wanted to load two servos in 90 degree instead of zero degree.
