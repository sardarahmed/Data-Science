Q:

nav2d exploration plugin

Hi all,
I see nav2d comes with the ability to plugin exploration planners via pluginlib for cooperative exploration.  The source includes some example plugins.
I've gone through the nav2d tutorials as well as the pluginlib tutorials but seem to be missing or overlooking a piece of basic information - how can I load and use one of the exploration planner plugins (of the three provided with the source) with the RobotNavigator?
Thanks!

A:

The Navigator has a parameter "exploration_strategy" to choose the strategy that is loaded at runtime.
