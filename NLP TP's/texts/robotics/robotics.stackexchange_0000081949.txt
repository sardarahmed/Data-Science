could you please provide a little more information? The link you provided gives us (me at least) a directory on their GitLab instance, but not any kind of instruction.
A little bit more of the CMake output would be useful as well.

the link was little bit forwarded page, i've updated it now. what i did is simply downloaded the package in my catkin workspace and than try to build it using command catkin_make but i got above error.

Which rosdistro are you using?

nvm -- I see you're using indigo

A:

The error here is that the build is trying to run git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD and it's failing. The error output isn't included, but I suspect it's because it isn't running in a git repository.
It looks like you need to clone the repository with git instead of downloading a tarball.
