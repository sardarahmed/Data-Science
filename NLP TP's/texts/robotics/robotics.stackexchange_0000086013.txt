Q:

How to extract images from a bagfile properly

Currently I have a bag file which recorded a camera view topic. Now I want to extract the image date with its corresponding time stamp. I am able to get the png form of the image data using the official way provided by ROS wiki, but some frames are missing even if I change the sec_per_frame parameter to be lower than 0.03. I am wondering what is the proper way to extract the image data.
To get the Bag Time, I simply rosplay the bag file and copy the information comes out from the terminal manually. It is okay for short-time recording, but definitely not a possible way for a long-time one. Is there a way I can save the bag time stamp into a text file directly? Is it possible to get the extracted images along with its corresponding time stamp?
Regards.

A:

Not sure if there is a tool included or available, but if not, the rosbag API can help you to write a little tool in Python or C++.
