Q:

Migrate foxy to humble

I have a general question. We are using foxy and it seems that foxy will soon be EOL.
I am wondering if we should change and if so if our nodes which are written in python will still work as well.
So what do I need to consider when switching from foxy to humble?

A:

Only the file setup.cfg. There you should replace the sign - with the sign _
I had many packages implemented for Foxy. Now I have Humble. I didn't have any problem importing and compiling them.
