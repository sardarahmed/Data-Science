Q:

catkin_ws_top: command not found

Creating a ROS package by hand.(ROS Tutorial 1-Intermediate level)
After reading this line:
*This tutorial assumes that we're working your catkin workspace and sourcing of the setup file is already done. *
I executed all tutorial 1-Beginner level and then When I run:
catkin_ws_top $ mkdir -p src/foobar

The Error is:
catkin_ws_top: command not found
Kindly help!

A:

That is a display of your command line and probably shows the path you are supposed to be in. The command starts after the $ sign.

But when we are in catkin workspace the path is catkin_ws. Where is catkin_ws_top?

When you are in a catkin workspace the path is - whatever you named it. It's just an example.
