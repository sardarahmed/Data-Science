Q:

ROS Indigo: Where is rqt_plot

Hello, I try wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics and want to run
$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot
but it says
[rospack] Error: package 'rqt_plot' not found
In the rqt_gui it is not listed in the plugins. I have installed ros-indigo-desktop-full
Is it possible to get rqt_plot running?

A:

It's possible that rqt_plot isn't included in the desktop-full variant for some reason. Have you tried installing it manually?
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rqt-plot

If it turns out that it's installable but isn't included in desktop-full, that's probably a bug in the desktop-full variant.

You're right, I was able to install manually on 14.04.

Ok. I've filed https://github.com/ros/metapackages/issues/4 for this.

Well, now I have installed it manually.
But now, when I execute
$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot
it says:
[DEBUG] rqt_plot.plot: import of PyQtGraphDataPlot failed (trying other backends)
qt_gui_main() found no plugin matching "rqt_plot"

OK, sorry. I'm new to ROS answers. I saw the PyQtGraph problem as a part of the rqt-plot issue. But now, I have googled it and so I found out, this is a separate issues independent from existing of rqt_plot in Indigo and solved it.
