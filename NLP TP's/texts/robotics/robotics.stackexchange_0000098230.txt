Q:

What is the relationship between universal-robot and Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver?

From the description, it seems both provide some sort of ROS driver for the UR robot.  universal-robot seems to contain additional moveit and gazebo resources, while Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver seem to contain a more fully fleshed out c++ ROS driver.

A:

In short:

universal_robot hosts an old, community contributed and deprecated driver which will be removed
Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver is the officially supported driver for all Universal Robots robots with CB3 controllers and newer

universal_robot also contains description packages and MoveIt configurations, and those will stay supported.
The Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver build instructions in the readme currently require you to clone a fork of universal_robot. That will change once things have been merged back into upstream.
