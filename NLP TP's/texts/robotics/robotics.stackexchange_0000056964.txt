Q:

How can I set a relative-path to compile my workspace in another machine?

Hello everyone,
I have written some code for publisher and subscriber and I am currently using SVN for versioning.
I committed the entire workspace, now when I took the checkout on other machine, I am not able to compile the source code.
I get the source-directory not found error.
I know that obviously its not the same workspace but is there a workaround to update the relative path, so that the next time anyone takes any checkout, the source code compiles on their machine ?

A:

You should be a little more specific about what you commit to version control.
In general, you don't want to commit any anything that can be rebuilt by the build process.
Specifically for ROS, you don't want to commit:

The build, bin and lib directories in rosbuild packages
Generated message files, headers, etc
The build, devel and install directories in a catkin workspace
