Q:

nao installation NaoQI Python SDK

Hello,everyone!
I'm fresh new in ROS. I have been followinig the tutorials. When I was tring to install ros for nao "Installing ROS on a remote PC to control Nao", I got stuck. How can I get the NaoQi Python SDK? I tried to search on google,but I didn't get it.
I installed the ros-hydro-desktop-full. I wondered if the SDK is integrated already.
best regards

A:

The NaoQI SDK is only available from Aldebaran Robotics and you usually get access to it by buying a Nao robot. You may also be able to get a trial version at https://community.aldebaran-robotics.com/ but I'm not sure if that only includes Choregraphe and not the SDK.
