Q:

how to make a small change to the move_base code with a standard ROS installation

Hello
I performed the standard installation of ROS KINETIC following this tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace ; http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu). However I would like to make a small change to the move_base code, (being more specific I would like to make a small change to the part of the code of the move_base that calls the my own global planner's make_plan method). Should I download the move_base from github (could someone provide me with the correct link?) to my catkin workspace and recompile with catkin_make? If so, how to make ROS use this new version of move_base recompiled instead of the one that came with the standard installation?
thanks

A:

Navigation Stack on GitHub
ROS will search your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in order, so packages in your own workspace will be found before the ones in /opt/ros... . Your self-compiled move_base will thus be used automatically instead.
