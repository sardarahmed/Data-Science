Q:

Setting up QT creator for ROS

Hi, I would like to ask whether there are any tutorials on how to setup the QT creator so that I can include ROS code into it. i am interested in using the QT creator to create a GUI that can publish msgs to control other parts of my ROS program. Thank you

A:

There is no need to set it up. Just create a package, open its CMakeLists.txt with QtCreator and you are done.
If you are not accustomed to using CMake with Qt you can have a look at this page. Getting to know CMake might require some reading, but I do not regret ditching qmake for CMake.

I had tried creating a package and use QTCreator to open the CMakeLists.txt. However, it seesm that CMake is unable to detect the rosbuild cmake file due to the environment variable $ENV(ROS_ROOT). Is there any way to correct this problem?

@MoggyQuek can you provide the error message that you got when Qt Creator was "unable to detect rosbuild cmake file" as you described? I'm just curious and I haven't seen that error
