Q:

What happened to the Pick And Place Manager in groovy?

In my application, I've been using the PickAndPlaceManager from the pr2_pick_and_place_demos package. At the moment, I'm trying to convert our software to Groovy, but the PickAndPlaceManager is gone. Some questions:

What are the reasons for removing it? Will it come back?
How hard would it be to upgrade it to Groovy? What would have to be done?
Is there an alternative? I.e., what's the preferred way to pick up and place objects using the PR2 on Groovy?

Thanks!
Martin

A:

Pick and place manager has been updated and added back to branch groovy-devel in https://github.com/ros-interactive-manipulation/pr2_object_manipulation .  Sorry it took so long!  Hopefully you had good luck with MoveIt! in the meantime. :)
The pick and place manager will definitely not be in Hydro, in any event--arm navigation and all of that has been deprecated.  Switch now if you can!

Well, I don't think I can switch to MoveIt yet; it doesn't yet seem to provide all the features that arm_navigation, object_manipulation etc. did. Thanks anyway (also to Dan Lazewasky), I'll give arm_navigation on groovy another try.

BTW, make sure you do sudo apt-get remove ros-groovy-geometric-shapes before trying to install.  There's a geometric_shapes dry package in arm_navigation that conflicts with the wet version used by MoveIt! so if you've installed MoveIt! on your computer, you'll have to uninstall it before arm_navigation will compile.

Thanks for the hint! Do you have any plans on solving the geometric-shapes issue?

No plans, alas.  It's likely you'll just have to pick one or the other forever.  Sorry!
