Also, I believe their package is called vrep_plugin if you have a package.xml looking for vrep_ros_plugin, that could be where your error is coming from.

A:

Did you copy the V-Rep ROS packages to your workspace and re-build your workspace as suggested in their tutorial: http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/rosTutorialHydro.htm ? I think that might help solve your issue.
