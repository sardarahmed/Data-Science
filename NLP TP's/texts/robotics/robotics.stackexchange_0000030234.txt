Q:

why cannot I tag one of my answers as answering my own question?

Hello,
I had the case today where I asked a question and found the answer myself a few hours later.
I then posted the solution by answering my own original question.
Now I'd like to mark my original question as "answered" by clicking my solution as answering my original question. But the system insists that I cannot accept my own answer for my own question.
I am afraid that with time, a lot of questions might be left unanswered and will pile up on the main page of ros answers.
So here is the question: is this behaviour wanted?

Ok, good to know that admins clean answered answers. but wouldn't it be more efficient for them to check answers answered by the initial asker? That way they would just need to look for people boosting their karma artificially.

right now admins have the power to answers their own questions and anyone else's questions.. We periodically go through and see if there are questions that have good answers that have not been accepted

if answering your own question increases karma then we would want this behavior. thats my opinion though

A:

This seems to be a useful (and definitely wanted) feature. I've opened an enhancement ticket for it on the ROS trac: Ticket #3405.

Just to reinforce the usefulness of it: I just spoted 2 questions like this in the last 10 minutes. It is so typical to have a quick look at the doc, then ask your question here, go back to the doc and find the answer, and post it here. Thanks for making the ticket!
