Q:

[useless] :rosrun tf view_frames

Hi all
I am unable to execute the following commmand in order to view my tf tree
rosrun tf view_frames 

which return the following error:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named view_frames below /opt/ros/groovy/share/tf

Is it becaue tf is updated and thus, there is other ways to view the tf tree? what is the command then?
Thank you

A:

What version of ros are you using? in Groovy it is just view_frames.

and do you know where is the generated pdf?
Comment by Gazer on 2013-06-13:
never mind. The location of the pdf is actually the curent directory of the running terminal

In the current location of the terminal.  So if you just open a terminal, it would be in the home directory.
