Q:

navigation stack vs my node

Hallo!
Is it possible to subscribe to user node from base_local_planner?
I'm trying to experiment with obstacle avoidance perfomance of my robot by integrating my emergency stop node that set a flag if an obstacle appears in it's field of view (narrow segment). Then given that flag I want to throw a banch of trajectories (which lie in this segment), generated by createTrajectories() function in base_local_planner package. I wonder if it's possible somehow to subscribe to this node so base-local_planner could use this flag.

What do you mean? Which data do you want to subscribe to or what functionality do you want to provide by your own node? Please be more specific.

For such an update to the question, it's best to edit your original post.

A:

The default base_local_planner node does not provide any topic-based interfaces to achieve what you want in a clean way. I suggest to fork it and add the functionality you need. The whole plugin is not that much code so adding new functionality should not be too hard.
