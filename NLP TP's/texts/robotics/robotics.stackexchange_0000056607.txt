Q:

Is there a backup of kforge.ros.org anywhere?

I occasionally find myself wanting to resurrect an old package that was hosted on kforge, and have been having to rely on forking some random person's fork (if I'm lucky). Did somebody manage to grab a backup before it was taken down?

Is there a specific package you're looking for?
Comment by Dan Lazewatsky on 2014-01-18:
At the moment, arm_navigation_experimental, but there have been a few others in the past that I don't remember.

Is the project megatree now hosted somewhere else? Wiki also says it's still at kforge....

A:

The arm_navigation and arm_navigation_experimental stacks are available on Willow Garage's github:

https://github.com/willowgarage/arm_navigation
https://github.com/willowgarage/arm_navigation_experimental

I'm looking for the source code for turtlebot_node which belongs to turtlebot package. is ther any backup for that? the kforge is down.

turtlebot_node appears to be obsolete, and the turltebot package has moved to github: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot . If you really need the turtlebot node, it's still present in the git history for that repository.
