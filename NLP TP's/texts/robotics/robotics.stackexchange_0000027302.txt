Q:

How to simulate AUV in Gazebo?

I'm looking at using Gazebo for simulating AUV in a pool for the RoboSub Competition. I was wondering if anyone knows if that is something that can be done and also if any world files exist for the competition arena.
Thank you.

A:

There is a plugin called Freefloating gazebo ( https://github.com/freefloating-gazebo ).
The model is very simple but depending on accuracy level your project needs it can be useful. Also, you can change the code and improve the model if you want to.
