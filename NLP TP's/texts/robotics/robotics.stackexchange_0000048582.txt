Q:

Parameter list from launch file

I'm using rosserial to pull a list of gains from the parameter server, but I can't seem to figure out how to use the <param> tag to create a list of values in a launch file.
EDIT: Specifically, trying to make one parameter of 'list' type, and then could be pulled in one go as shown here.
EDIT2: <rosparam param = "~pid">[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 100]</rosparam> works to load a list, however roslaunch seems to automatically parse the values as strings
EDIT3: <rosparam param = "pid">[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 100.0]</rosparam> works fine

A:

If you use the tag to load the list you can use a yaml file like so:
- item
- item2
However, if you want to set the param directly as a list within the launch file using 
here is an example. Look for the planner_options parameter.
<rosparam param="planner_options">
        - (planning_scene_navstack_init@libplanner_modules_pr2.so /map 0.05 1)
        - (putdown_init@libputdown_modules.so /map)
</rosparam>
