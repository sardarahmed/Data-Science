Q:

Catkin_make fails due to Bzip2 libraries on Raspberry Pi

Hi, I'm using Ros Indigo installed on a Raspberry Pi model B. When I run catkin_make I get an error during the compilation of RosBag-storage package.  The BZIP2_LIBRARIES BZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR are missing.
-- +++ processing catkin package: 'rosbag_storage'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(ros_comm/rosbag_storage)
-- Boost version: 1.49.0
-- Found the following Boost libraries:

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! Invoking "cmake" failed

How can I add these libraries?

A:

Just install libbz2-dev package with:
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
This package contains the header files required to compile your rosbag_storage.
