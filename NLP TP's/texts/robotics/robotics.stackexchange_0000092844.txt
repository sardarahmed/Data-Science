Q:

I have followed all the command to install ros melodic in Ubuntu bionic but stucked at setting up environment variables

Run
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

Then after
source ~/.bashrc

Showing
bash: /otp/ros/melodic/setup.bash: No such file or directory.

/otp/ros...

is this a typo in your question or what you're actually seeing it should be /opt/ros.... This could be causing your problem.
If you look at the contents of your .bashrc script you can check and fix the typo if that's the case

i copy pasted from http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu
and it is like
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

Ok.
So what is the output of ls -al /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash?
And the output of lsb_release -a?
And of uname -a?
Comment by 1at7 on 2019-08-03:
Output of
1st
ls: cannot access '/opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash' : No such file or directory
2nd
No LSB modules are available.
And for 3rd one.. my PC name, Ubuntu version, GNU/Linux

We need the verbatim, exact copy-paste of the uname -a output. You can change your PC name, but leave the rest.
As to the rest: it would appear that you haven't installed ROS.

unaame -a output as
Linux *********  #26~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 27 07:28:31 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

i even tried instaling LSB but it shows
E: Malformed entry 1 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list (Suite)
E: The list of sources could not be read.

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2019-08-03:
Ah, that would appear to be your problem: it's likely that apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full didn't actually succeed. Didn't you get an error?
I'm pretty sure that the fact that lsb_release doesn't work is the cause of your problems.
What is the output of cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list?
Comment by 1at7 on 2019-08-03:
it gives
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu

(lsb_release -sc) main

output of trying install ros was w/o error when i run 1st time  but it gives this now
E: Malformed entry 1 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list (Suite)
E: The list of sources could not be read.
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?

not saying you're lying, but without ros-latest.list setup correctly, it's impossible for apt to install anything.
Comment by sspanderkar@gmail.com on 2020-10-17:
in my case its still not working

A:

it gives

deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu

(lsb_release -sc) main

The problem most likely is that lsb_release has not been setup/installed correctly, which causes the command given in the installation tutorials to produce incorrect output, leading to a malformed ros-latest.list, which then causes apt to fail downloading indices from the ROS package repositories, leading to apt install never succeeding to install ROS.
Steps to fix:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt clean && sudo apt update

Pay special attention to the output of apt update. It should not report any errors or warnings.
Now you should be able to run sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full successfully, and a source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash should also succeed.
Note that we're avoiding the use of lsb_release -sc here by just specifying the bionic value (which is the codename of your Ubuntu distribution). If you'd like to fix lsb_release (and are sure lsb_release -sc doesn't actually output anything) you could try to do something like sudo apt install --reinstall lsb-release lsb-core and see if lsb_release -sc starts working.

Does it now work?

i am really noob in linux

If you're planning on using ROS, it would be good to get familiar with Linux (or just Ubuntu) a bit more. It will probably help make all of this less 'magic' and complicated.
