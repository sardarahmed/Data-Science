Q:

Spawn URDF Joint Stiffness

I am trying to spawn a URDF model in Gazebo without loading a controller for the robot.  I have found that the joints are very 'floppy' when no controller is loaded.  Is there a command in the launch file or urdf which will increase the joint stiffness if no controller is running?

A:

You could try setting the joint friction and/or damping to a very high value.
<joint name="joint_name" type="continuous">
    ...
    <joint_properties damping="1000.0" friction="1000.0"/>
</joint>

Yep, not a bad idea for a completely static robot model.  However I do plan on writing controllers and using the robot in sim.  Just wanted to see if there was a quick fix, much like launching joints at explicit angles with -J joint_name 0.4 etc.

If no controllers are running, why can't the joints just be fixed?

I did have this previously with damping at 100 and friction at 1000, and after playing with the values from 0 up to 10^5 it still seems that there was no difference.  These properties seem to come into play with the transmission and controllers running.  Hmmm..

This post is quite old, but if possible plz reply. What if I have objects like cupboard and there doors are opening and closing w/o any apparent reason. I want ROBOT to close and open them. in that case I guess I'll not write a controller for cupboard. How to make the doors remain in one position?
