Q:

Creating distro-specific documentation on wiki.ros.org

I can't seem to find instructions on how to make distro-specific documentation on wiki.ros.org.  For example, I have a package called skeleton_markers that has buttons labeled Electric, Fuerte and Groovy at the top.  However, no matter which button is selected, when I edit the page the changes appear on all three versions.  What is the magic for making changes to just one distribution's wiki page and not the others?
Thanks
patrick

A:

You would use a special wiki tag:
{{{#!wiki version cturtle
`openni_camera` is not available in C Turtle. Select a newer distro above.
}}}

An example page to look at would be openni_camera: http://wiki.ros.org/openni_camera
A number of the turtlebot pages actually end up creating a new page and including it:
{{{#!wiki version electric fuerte
<<Include(turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/pre_groovy/TurtleBot Bringup)>>
}}}

{{{#!wiki version groovy
<<Include(turtlebot_bringup/Tutorials/groovy/TurtleBot Bringup)>>
}}}

Thanks @fergs.  The only extra piece of info I needed was to use an extra pair of { and } when enclosing another block like {{{{#!wiki version groovy {{{$ rosmake $ roslaunch package launchfile.launch}}}}.
