Q:

Where is the link to ros::init() code API?

I'm reading this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Initialization%20and%20Shutdown
In this page, there is a link to "ros::init() code API", but the link is broken.
Using Google I've found another page where "ros::init()" is not a link:
http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/roscpp/html/
Could someone help me or write the correct link in the tutorial?
Thanks.

A:

This is related to a doxygen regression: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744762
Doxygen fails to extract the ros::init() functions and therefore API documentation itself can't cross reference it and the wiki can't link to them.
Until doxygen releases a fix for that we can't do anything about it.
Please look directly at the source code (https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/bd10f702dcf4c447cc421ed3fd4838f9173afe28/clients/roscpp/include/ros/init.h#L68-L103) to see the available signatures and their documentation.
