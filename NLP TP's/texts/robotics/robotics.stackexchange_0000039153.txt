Q:

sensor_msgs in Windows

I have images coming from a camera into a Windows PC (through an sdk that only works in Windows) and would like to publish the image as a message in ROS. I've used the image type from sensor_msgs in Linux and would like to publish the same message in Windows, but I haven't found the sensor_msgs package. Has the code for sensor_msgs been ported to Windows yet (or is it planned in the near future)?

A:

You can follow progress of the msvc build on Fuerte at the following links:

WinRos
Msvc Build Environment - Fuerte

It's already compiling common_msgs (including sensor_msgs). We'll start packaging an sdk (libs and headers) sometime shortly.
