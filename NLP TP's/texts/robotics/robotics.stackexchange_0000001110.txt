Q:

Robots minimum distance

I am trying to implement a mechanism to make robots avoid being too close (Say in a distance less than d). I am not familiar with those systems and I have to implement a strategy to avoid robots being too close to each other. Could anyone recommend me some readings for such a problem or a set of keywords to search for? I don't know yet how to start.

A:

A good place to start is with the work by Dr. Jur van den Berg and his colleagues. Check out the publications velocity obstacles and reciprocal collision avoidance. You could start with the latest paper, Reciprocal Collision Avoidance for Robots with Linear Dynamics using LQR-Obstacles, they have released on the subject and use the citations to find more related material.

A:

Do you mean too close to each other?
It sounds like you might be referring to the sorts of steering behaviours that Craig Reynold's refers to in his Boids project. He describes some behaviours that exhibit as flocking or herding because of the way the participants avoid each other, yet stick together.  He uses the terms 'separation', 'alignment' and 'cohesion' to describe the algorithms involved. 
Craig applies these to computer simulations, but you could just as well apply the concepts to robots.
Other searches that may prove beneficial: 'flock simulation', 'crowd modelling'.
