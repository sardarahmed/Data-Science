Q:

bag_to_pcd failed to contact master

i'm trying to run 'bag_to_pcd' from the terminal but keep getting the following error..
[ERROR] [1320830633.224372085]: [registerPublisher] Failed to contact master at [localhost:11311].  Retrying... 

rosrun pcl_ros bag_to-pcd points2.bag /camera/depth/points2 mr 

where,

points2.bag is my bag file
/camera/depth/points2 is the topic
mr is the directory where to put the pcd files

if i ctrl c out of it, the following comes up...
^Cterminate called after throwing an instance of 'ros::TimeNotInitializedException' 
  what():  Cannot use ros::Time::now() before the first NodeHandle has been created or ros::start() has been called.  If this is a standalone app or test that just uses ros::Time and does not communicate over ROS, you may also call ros::Time::init() 
Aborted 

and rosbag info points2.bag gives me...

A:

You should start roscore before running bag_to_pcd.

If you can't figure that out yourself, please post a new question.

yep, that was it. but now there seems to be an issue with the way bag-to_pcd is doing the actual conversion. i get  a bunch of binary pcd files which only display a few points when using rxbag.
