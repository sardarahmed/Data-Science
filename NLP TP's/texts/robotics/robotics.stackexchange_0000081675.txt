Q:

Rosserial arduino connection error

Hello everyone,
I am currently trying to connect my arduino due to my pc in order to run my ROS package I wrote, which shall communicate with the arduino.
I can compile and upload my program via the GUI. To start the serial connection, I run:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

Which produces the output:
[INFO] [1499369503.299387]: ROS Serial Python Node
[INFO] [1499369503.305172]: Connecting to /dev/ttyACM0 at 57600 baud
[ERROR] [1499369520.430946]: Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

I don't really understand the message. I wrote all my nodes in ROS kinetic and also installed rosserial via:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial

just like it was done in the tutorial.
Why is the arduino assigned to a particular ROS version anyway? How can I set this to kinetic?
I am working on a virtual box with Ubuntu 16.04
Does somebody know how to solve that problem?
Thanks in advance,
Felix

such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

this is an example. It does not refer to exact versions of anything. It's basically giving you one specific example of a cause for this issue (ie: using different versions of things).

I know. But still i have no idea how to solve this.

A:

It now works on an Arduino Mega 2650. Same settings, same code, works.
It even got the same amount of pins available.
