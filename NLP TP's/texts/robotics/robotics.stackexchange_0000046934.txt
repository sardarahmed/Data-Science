Have you modified your ~/.bashrc file? If yes, can you please share your modifications?

A:

That error results from a directory not being in existence. You can create it:
mkdir ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox

If it exists, make sure you are in the right user account. Maybe update your post with the end of your ~/.bashrc file? It is highly unlikely that this error is the result of that file, however.
