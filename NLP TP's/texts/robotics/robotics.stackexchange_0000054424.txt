Q:

Fail to load nodelet

Hi, I'm new to ROS and i'm trying to generate a very simple map of the room that i'm in with my Kinect.
I am using ccny_rgbd_tools but I reach a point that gives me nodelets related errors...
I used the command roslaunch ccny_openni_launch openni.launch
process[camera_rgb_frame_tf-5]: started with pid [7726]
[ERROR] [1380277981.435323719]: Failed to load nodelet [/rgbd_image_proc] of type [ccny_rgbd/RGBDImageProcNodelet]: Could not find library corresponding to plugin ccny_rgbd/RGBDImageProcNodelet. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.

log file: /home/dina/.ros/log/f9767520-275c-11e3-b82a-e006e61ca148/rgbd_image_proc-4*.log

Any ideas of why this is happening or any clues of how to fix it?
Or even if you thing there is a better way to make the mapping of the room without using ccny_rgbd_tools.
Thank you very much!

A:

The errors says "Could not find library corresponding to plugin ccny_rgbd/RGBDImageProcNodelet"
The usual cause of this error are that the library has not been compiled. If you're on a remote machine, make sure that the remote machine has the package installed and it has been compiled. (Note the package which needs to be compiled is ccny_rgbd not ccyn_rgbd_tools)
