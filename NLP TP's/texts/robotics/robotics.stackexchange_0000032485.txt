Q:

Creating supernode

I want to create a node which handles other nodes.
Like it looks into the clients and their requests, and looks for the servers which provide the required service, starts those servers and provide the corresponding service to the client. How do i go about it?
Thanks in advance...

rosh offers introspection capabilities into the ROS API and may offer a good set of tools to start with.
