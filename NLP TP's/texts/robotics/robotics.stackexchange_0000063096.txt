A:

Its not possible because sudo is calling the command as root; and your enviroment variables (source setup.bash) are not set for user root!
Theoretically you could log in as root (sudo su) then source and setup everything and then run your nodes as root; However, I'd highly recommend not to do that and find a way to run your nodes as normal user...
