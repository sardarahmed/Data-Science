Q:

ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu Mate 16.04 ARMHF (Raspberry Pi 3)

I'm trying to install ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu Mate 16.04 following these instructions:
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
The site says that armhf is supportet. However when executing
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full

I always get the error
unable to locate package ros-kinetic-desktop-full

Same for desktop or basic install. Is there any idea what I could do?
ros-latest.list contains as first line deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial main, that should be ok...

I am alos using the Raspberry Pi 3 under Ubuntu Mate. It will be good to be in touch with you and have some discussion in this regard. I am also facing various kinds of problems, for example in the installation for rosaria. It will be good to be in touch with you for this purpose kam@hanyang.ac.kr.
