Q:

Turtlesim Pose theta

Hi all,
I'm trying to get the theta (or any) float variable from the turtlesim.msg Pose, and not having any luck.
I've been trying things like;
subscribing directly to theta, rospy.Subscriber("turtle1/pose", turtlesim.msg.Pose('theta'))
or by subscribing to pose and pulling theta out of the pose msg
Thanks for any help,

A:

Subscribing to the pose and retrieving values from the message is the way to do it and does work.
