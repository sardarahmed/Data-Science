Q:

Stage not working

I am following this tutorial:
http://wiki.ros.org/lse_roomba_toolbox/Tutorials/Simulating%20a%20Roomba%20on%20Stage
When I enter this command,
rosrun stage stageros roomba_isr_floor0.world
it gives this error
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named stageros below /opt/ros/hydro/share/stage

Does anyone knows how to solve this? I'm having the same error here... I'm trying to run stage with a simple command:
$  rosrun stage_ros stageros ./map01_Room.world
But I get this error:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named stageros below /opt/ros/indigo/share/stage_ros

A:

You've got the package name wrong, it's stage_ros not stageros and the executable name is stageros not stage_ros (confusing I know). When I run that command:
$ rosrun stage stage_ros roomba_isr_floor0.world

On my Ubuntu 12.04.5 Hydro install I get an error that it cannot find the world file (expected) but if does find and run stageros:
william@ubuntu:~$ rosrun stage_ros stageros roomba_isr_floor0.world
[FATAL] [1438216243.460273767]: The world file roomba_isr_floor0.world does not exist.
 [Loading roomba_isr_floor0.world]err: unable to open world file roomba_isr_floor0.world : No such file or directory (/tmp/buildd/ros-hydro-stage-4.1.1-6precise-20141231-2201/libstage/worldfile.cc Load)

Stage: User closed window

It looks like that tutorial needs to be updated. If you figure out what it should be please feel free to update the tutorial.
