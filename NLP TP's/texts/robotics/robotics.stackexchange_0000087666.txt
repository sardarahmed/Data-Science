Q:

ROS Qt Creator Plug-in installation error

Hi,
I am on ubuntu 16.04.
I am trying to install ROS Qt Creator Plug-in (I followed steps of ROS industrial tutorial) but when I try to launch qtcreator-ros (as showed in plug-in step), I get the following errors :
axyn@axyn-ubuntu:~$ qtcreator-ros 
libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: radeonsi
libGL error: unable to load driver: radeonsi_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: radeonsi
libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
Unrecognized OpenGL version
Unrecognized OpenGL version

Does someone know what my problem is ?
Thanks a lot !

It looks like qtcreator is failing to find the radeon graphics driver (or a part of it). I would check that your graphics drivers are set up correctly.

I tried to fix problems with drivers but impossible to update them. I maybe have a problem between ubuntu version 16.04 and last qtcreator version...

A:

Hello, I just want to confirm that you followed the install procedure found in the link below? Also, what architecture are you installing it on (x86, arm64, etc.)?
