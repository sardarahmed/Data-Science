Q:

rqt_graph in UsingRqtconsleRoslaunch tutorial not working

I'm currently in the process of going through the tutorials so I can get a better understanding of ROS.
I'm currently on tutorial 8 in the beginning tutorials
The problem I'm getting is at the last step when I use the command rqt_graph
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UsingRqtconsoleRoslaunch
At the step where I'm using the launch file to launch 2 turtles. That works fine. Afterwards i use the rostopic pub command to get the turtles to go in a circle continuously. That works fine as well. However when I use rqt_graph I get the following error
angelo@angelo-Satellite-S55t-B:~$ rqt_graph
PluginHandlerDirect._restore_settings() plugin "rqt_graph/RosGraph#0" raised an exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    subgraph_nodeitem = self.getNodeItemForSubgraph(subgraph, highlight_level)
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qt_dotgraph/dot_to_qt.py", line 83, in getNodeItemForSubgraph
    bb = subgraph.attr['bb'].strip('"').split(',')
KeyError: 'bb'

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
Btw I'm using ROS indigo and Ubuntu 14.04

A:

Try:
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

with roscore and the tutorial nodes running.
