Hi,
I got continuos errors when using Indigo with Gazebo.

http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/13054/namespaces-error-waiting-for-1second/ (this error arises when Installing indigo-full and launching gazebo)
Am I doing this in a wrong way or should I stop using indigo with gazebo as this version was abandoned and not maintained well any longer?

A:

Gazebo 2.2 reached end of life on January 2016, so it is recommended you upgrade to a newer version.
See these tutorials on how to use a specific version of Gazebo with ROS.
