Q:

joint controller in gazebo

i created a linear joint . basically, it is like a linear actuator only can move up and down like the pr2 torso. but i stuck at making it moves in gazebo. Is there any gazebo plugin for it ? or do i have to write a controller? Thanks

A:

A working example can be found with the  rrbot tutorial on ros_control. Have you tried this ? Or is it not what you are looking for ? I think you have to write your own controller. I am not sure if there are generic position and effort controllers available as plugging.

Good answer. I don't think you have to write your own controller though, one of the joint position controllers in ros_control should do the trick, as shown in the rrbot tutorial.
