Q:

Use roscore, roslaunch and rosrun in bash script

Hello!
I want to start roscore and several ros nodes from a other program with a bash script:
#!/bin/bash
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source /catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roscore

when I call the script manually everything works, but when i call it from the other program (with system(start_ros.sh)) nothing happens.
Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

A:

Solved it by exporting my ros path in the bash script!
