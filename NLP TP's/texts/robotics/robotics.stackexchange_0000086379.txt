Q:

Run RViz with configuration file from .launch file

Hi everyone!
I was wondering if there is any way you can open rviz from a launch file while openning a custom configuration. The terminal command would be:
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find package_name`/rviz/config_file.rviz

Thank you!

A:

Yes:
<launch>
  <node type="rviz" name="rviz" pkg="rviz" args="-d $(find package_name)/rviz/config_file.rviz" />
</launch>

Note that this is the same approach you would use for any program / node that accepts command line arguments. Doing it in a launch file just allows you to use the find substitutation command.
