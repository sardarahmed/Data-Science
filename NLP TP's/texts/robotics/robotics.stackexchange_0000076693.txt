Q:

ROS installation on ARCH LINUX : qt or shiboken error

I tried to install ROS JADE on my new arch linux machine via AUR repos using yaourt
and I can't even understand the error. sure something in python maybe a dependency related to qt
but I am not able to understand what it is. See the screenshot
the command I use is

yaourt --noconfirm ros-jade-desktop

Please don't use images to show us what is essentially text. Copy/paste from your terminal into your question, then format the console text using the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it). Images are not searchable, reducing the visibility of this question (in Google fi).

A:

The error is "No such file or directory" And it's trying to invoke qmake. I would guess that qmake is not installed on your system.
