I've tried different solutions from the internet but nothing worked.
Thank you in advance

A:

It looks like a permission error in the build folder, check to make sure you have the right permissions in that folder.

Thank you for you response, i accessed the folder using a password, but now i have another error:
Linking CXX shared library /home/ssc044/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libsr_ronex_transmissions.so
[ 35%] Built target sr_ronex_transmissions
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make -j4 -l4" failed

i read somewhere that emptying the build folder then cmake again would do the trick. is it the right path to follow?
Thank you again
