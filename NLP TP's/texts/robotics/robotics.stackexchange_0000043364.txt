A:

All in all, there isn't anything here to be concerned about. You can probably ignore these errors.

No package or stack in context

This is just telling you that the current working directory from which you're calling roswtf is neither a ros stack or a ros package.

ERROR Not all paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
[/home/ahmad/ROSworksapce/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros]
point to an existing directory: *
/home/ahmad/ROSworksapce/sandbox

This is telling you that some directories in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH don't exist. Specifically, "/home/ahmad/ROSworksapce/sandbox" doesn't exist. Check the .rosinstall file in your ros workspace and remove it if you don't want to see this message.

ERROR Not all paths in PYTHONPATH
[/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/roslib/src:/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.6/dist-packages:]
point to a directory: *
/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/roslib/src

This is telling you that some directories in your PYTHONPATH don't exist. Specifically, "/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/roslib/src" doesn't exist. This looks like it's a (benign) bug in the PYTHONPATH exported by setup.sh. It used to be that that was where roslib lived, but not anymore. This might warrant a ticket if one doesn't already exist.

I found this msg is unclear as well, so opened ros/ros_comm#1505.

@jbohren seems that nobody open a ticket for the issue with the PYTHONPATH. I get this message too, if I run roswtf
