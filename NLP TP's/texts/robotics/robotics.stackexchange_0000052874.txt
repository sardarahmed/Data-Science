A:

There's no reason why you couldn't do that. The phantom_omni package gives you a 6D pose (the pose that you want the end effector to be in). You'd have to create an arm navigation configuration package for your complete robot (like kurtana_arm_navigation), then you can write a node that sends the pose from the phantom as a goal to the move_arm action. The motion planner would then plan a path to the desired pose and execute it on the robot.
Maybe even better would be to implement an inverse kinematics controller instead of using motion planning; perhaps this would allow you to send goals more frequently, allowing for a smoother motion of the arm. The package katana_ikfast_kinematics_plugin provides a 5D IK for the Katana arm.
You can also have a look at the pr2_omni_teleop package, where they developed something similar for the PR2.
