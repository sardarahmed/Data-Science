Q:

RGBDSLAM indigo

Hello,
Thanks to Felix Endres for his great package.
I use RGBDSLAM on ROS indigo (Ubuntu 14.04) with freenect driver.
I see errors messages : "Using Standard kinect /openni_camera -> /openni_rgb_optical_frame as transformation (This message is throttled to 1 per 5 seconds)".
May be a problem with freenect (instead of openni ?).
Thanks for reply

A:

If I remember correctly, this just means that rgbdslam doesn't receive the tf  transformation from /openni_camera to /openni_rgb_optical_frame. Maybe the frames are called differently with freenect. However this shouldn't impede functionality unless you intentionally modified and the mentioned transformation and want to use it (e.g. for extrinsically calibrating the camera to a robot).
