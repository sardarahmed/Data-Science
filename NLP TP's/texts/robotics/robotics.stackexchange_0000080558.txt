Q:

How to stop generating msg and srv for certain languages

I followed ROS tutorials where I generated msg and srv and everything worked well.
However, I saw that message_generation creates msgs and srvs not only for Python and C++ as I expected, but also for NodeJS, common-lisp and eusLisp. How can I "turn off" this? I need only Python and C++ types. I searched CMakeLists.txt but couldn't find anything related to these languages.
