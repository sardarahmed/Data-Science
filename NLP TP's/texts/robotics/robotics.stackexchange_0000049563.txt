Q:

uEye camera in ROS

Hello,
I am trying to setup an uEye USB camera in ROS. I already installed the official drivers, and the camera is working correctly.
For ROS integration, I found two references:
http://ros.org/wiki/ueye
It only supports IS_CM_BGR8_PACKED format, so no color images available.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ueye_cam
Seems more complete than the previous one, but the pointer to the repository is missing and I am not able to find it.
Can someone point me out where to find the package ueye_cam ?
Thank you

Are you using a pylon camera?

@NEngelhard you can look at this website https://de.ids-imaging.com/downloads.html, to find your right cmaera model driver. but you have to register

A:

It's up now (it was previously in limbo for various reasons). I can't post links, so just check the ROS wiki page.
