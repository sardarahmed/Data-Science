A:

Running rviz is not enough to see your robot, you must also provide the body relative position using robot_state_publisher for instance. I recommend you use instead:
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch mode:=robot.urdf
It will load the necessary parameters in the parameter server, start the robot_state_publisher node as well as rviz for you.
See the
URDF tutorials for more information.
