A:

First, install that package:

Thanks. Works but I noticed that comments from msg files are not included in the documentation as they were with rosdoc. And comments are missing in the doc on www.ros.org. I seem to remember some doc like the one for NavSatFix having more information before...

Your are right. That's unfortunate. Maybe we should open an issue ticket.

I added an issue in github for this.
