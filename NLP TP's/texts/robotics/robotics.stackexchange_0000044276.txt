Q:

Dual Turtlebot Arms

Does anyone have two of the Turtlebot arms installed on their Turtlebot? Is there any reason this wouldn't be possible/advisable?
Thanks
Andy

A:

You could do this, you would have to adjust a number of configuration files, the urdf, etc. I would suggest using a single ArbotiX and then making the second arm have higher servo IDs so that no IDs are duplicated between the arms.
