Q:

Mock diagnostics?

So far I haven't seen any simulated modules that emit diagnostics topics. Is there actually one that does so?
Without having a real robot that implements diagnostics it's hard to go on making tools that utilize it (eg. rqt_robot_monitor). Fixed diagnostic values might be fine as long as there's a variety.

A:

Diagnostics tend to be very specific for a set of drivers, so I don't think you'll find much simulated.
One option might be to use the ArbotiX drivers, as we do have a "sim" mode that simply sort of just echos whatever commands are given to it. You could run the "fake-maxwell.launch" from maxwell_defs found here: https://github.com/mikeferguson/maxwell The robot doesn't publish a ton of diagnostics, but it does publish the state of each controller/joint.
