A:

So these errors are really misleading. ROS packages are unfortunately not available as homebrew formulae yet, so ros/hydro/pcl_msgs does not exist. You will have to install it from source.
What instructions have you been following and what packages are your current workspace? You must have added something that depends of pcl_msgs. Please edit your question to contain this information.
