Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rviz flick

Does anybody have this problem  with ATI hardware and ubuntu 10.10?

A:

partial solution (from the mailing list):
I tried with glxgears (and fgl_glxgears) and I saw the same flickering
effect, so I searched with google for the enviroment variable you told
me and I found something interesting.
<glxinfo | grep rendering> reports
direct rendering: No (LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT set)
to correct this behavior I typed

and the flickering on glxgears disapperas, and also on Rviz.
I noticed this: if I launch the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T I get
<<direct rendering: No (LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT set)>> but if I launch
konsole instead with ALT+F2 I get <>
I don't understand exactly what is happening, but the only other way
to solve the problem is disabling compiz like Nathaniel wrote. I think
that there is some method to launch a window/console without using
compiz even the system is using it, but I don't know how.
For now I put  at the end of .bashrc and
seems to work fine.
