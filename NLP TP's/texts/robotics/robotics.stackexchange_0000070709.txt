Q:

Python - Compressed Image, Publisher/Subscriber

I have implemented the code provided in:
http://wiki.ros.org/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/WritingImagePublisherSubscriber
however the published topic is empty. It does not contain any information. I tried to dump the topic information into a .txt file and it is empty. when I compare this with the topics published by the camera node, I get the right information (header, frame_id, data).
I printed the msg data structure before "self.image_pub.publish(msg)" (line 87) and the msg structure appears fine.
I have the compressed transport installed and working correctly as I can see the image from the camera node using image_view but not the /output/image (the topic published by the code from the link above). It is obvious I am missing something ... not sure what.
Any suggestion?

A:

Solved the problem: the issue was in using a mix of roslaunch and rosrun. Once I called the code from the link from the same roslaunch file with the camera then everything worked fine.
Not 100% sure why though as a rqt_view showed the right node-tree ...
