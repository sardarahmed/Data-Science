Q:

Inform a node that another node is closed

Hi guys,
I am currently working on a roscpp project and I met a problem: I have a publisher node A and a subscriber node B. Now I want to close the node A via the terminal, and I want to inform B that its publisher got closed. Is there any possibility to realize this?
Thanks!

I've never used it myself, but it sounds like Bond might be something to look into.
