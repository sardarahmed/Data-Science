Q:

How to SLAM Mapping with Ultrasonic Sensors instead of Kinect?

Hey guys,
I am trying to do the SLAM mapping with an ultrasonic sensor(HC-SR04). It works on my raspberry pi using Python.
I wonder if there is any package I can use to use RViz and gmapping, with my ultrasonic sensor. I do not know how to publish the distance reading information from Raspberry Pi to my turtlebot laptop.
Thanks.

Hi! Doing SLAM with just a 1-point range sensor is impossible but you can still do some cheapo mapping, please take a look at the Python code that I wrote at this repo: https://github.com/RiccardoGiubilato/ros_autonomous_car. Here I have a crius board hooked up to a wheel encoder and an ultrasonic sensor. The crius (based on atmega328) publishes odometry and range data which is used by a Udoo board mounted on the car itself to build an OccupancyGrid.
