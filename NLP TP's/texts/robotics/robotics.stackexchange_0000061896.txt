Q:

Robotino ROS pcl::VoxelGrid

Hey,
i checked out the robotino packages from  http://svn.openrobotino.org/robotino-ros-pkg/trunk/ and want to build them via rosmake. When i type rosmake robotino i get the following error and i have no idea what to do about it:
In file included from /home/daniel/Desktop/robotino/trunk/robotino/robotino_node/src/KinectROS.cpp:10:0:
/usr/include/pcl-1.7/pcl/filters/voxel_grid.h: In instantiation of 'class pcl::VoxelGrid<sensor_msgs::PointCloud2_<std::allocator<void> > >': /home/daniel/Desktop/robotino/trunk/robotino/robotino_node/src/KinectROS.cpp:124:44: required from here /usr/include/pcl-1.7/pcl/filters/voxel_grid.h:474:61: error: no type namen 'type' in struct pcl::traits::fieldList<sensor_msgs::PointCloud2_<std::allocator<void> > >
typedef typename pcl::traits::fieldList<PointT>::type FieldList;

I really have no idea what i have to do here, i thaught it would be no problem to build these packages.There are a few more erros like this but this is the first one. Maybe i can resolve the others by myself when i get this one fixed. Can anyone help me here?
Best regards,
Daniel

Which version of ROS was this developed for? Which version of ROS are you trying to use it with? I think some of the PCL point types and ROS integration changed between ROS Groovy and Hydro.

I try to use it with ROS Indigo. I know that PCL is a stand-alone project since quite a time and because of that i use pcl-1.7 instead. I tried to install an older ROS version but it doesn't work. It tells me that ros-groovy-desktop-full has unmet dependencies?! Is it possible to fix this within Indigo?

A:

I suspect the robotino stack was developed against an older version of ROS, and uses an older version of the PCL types.
The robotinio repository you linked to has a migrate_to_catkin branch which may work on newer versions of ROS: http://svn.openrobotino.org/robotino-ros-pkg/branches/robotino/migrate_to_catkin/
If that doesn't work, you'll probably have to follow the PCL section of the Hydro Migration guide to upgrade the code you're having trouble with to the new PCL types.

Thanks for your answer, i will try the migrate_to_catkin branch. For the moment it works to comment out the parts which use the ROSKinect.cpp class.
