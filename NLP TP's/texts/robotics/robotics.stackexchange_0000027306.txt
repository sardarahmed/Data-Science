Q:

Gazebo5 simulator ball bearings leak through bowl walls

I have created a simulation where 1000 ball bearings are put inside a bowl. What happens is that some of the balls get through the walls of the bowl, leaking outside it. Most of the balls remain inside the bowl and react properly to interactions with them, but some others, go through the bowl.
Here there is a video showing the behavior
Ball Leaking Video
The ball bearings model is just the model provided by Gazebo.
Can anyone give me a hint about how to avoid this behavior?
My system:

Ubuntu 14.04
ROS Indigo
Gazebo5 (for ROS packages)

Hi there,
I also noticed this bug and filed an issue report. Feel free to give it a vote/comment so it gets more attention.
This happens because the spheres only collide with the edges of the meshes, so if the mesh triangles are larger the spheres just fall through them.
For a quick workaround you can make your bowls' mesh triangles smaller. This of course will make the simulation slower.
Cheers,
Andrei
