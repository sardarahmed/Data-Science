Q:

Current map provided with laser scan

Hi, I am new in ROS and I want to do a SLAM using gmapping package with "laser scan" and "odometry data".
In the first step I just want to see the current map provided with laser scan in fixed location (x = 0, y = 0, theta = 0) in rviz.
I have laser scan topic but I don't have a odometry data yet, so I want to make a fake odometry data. For this I think I should publish a TF data with all zeros.
I think I should do some thing like this  link:
1 
2 
3 
Am I in the right path? could you please tell me what should I do in details? or show me some references?

A:

If you're using a laser scanner, using hector_mapping can be easier than gmapping. Launch the mapping program and publish a 0,0,0 static transform between base_link and laser to account for your non existent odometry and you should be set.
<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_to_laser_tf" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link laser 100"/>

Just my two cents.
