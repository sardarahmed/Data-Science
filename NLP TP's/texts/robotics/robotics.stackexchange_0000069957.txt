Q:

How do I compile ROS from source using a forked ros_comm

I want to compile ROS from source. To do this, I can follow the instructions from http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source, specifically the lines
rosinstall_generator ros_comm --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only > indigo-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall 
wstool init -j8 src indigo-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall

However, I want to use my own forked version of ros_comm packages from https://github.com/asundaresan/ros_comm
It is not clear to me how I can build a bare-bones ROS from source using the above forked version. I'd be grateful for any pointers or instructions for the same. I could not find any.
Thanks,
Aravind.

A:

I haven't tried this solution myself. But this may work:

Add --upstream option to rosinstall_generator ros_comm .. command:

rosinstall_generator ros_comm --upstream --rosdistro indigo --deps --wet-only > indigo-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall

Modify indigo-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall and change the URI of ros_comm repo to your own fork. Make sure to change the version field to appropriate branch/tag of your fork.

    - git:
    local-name: ros_comm
    uri: https://github.com/asundaresan/ros_comm
    version: 1.11.15

To ensure maximum compatibility, it is a good practice to rebase your changes on top of the current stable version of ros_comm. 1.11.15 in this case.
