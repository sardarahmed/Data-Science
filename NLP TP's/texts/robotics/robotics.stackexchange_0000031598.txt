Q:

opencv2 sources missing on code.ros.org?

Hello,
I was trying to get the source for opencv2 from:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vision_opencv/trunk/opencv2
but it seems to missing most of the files.  The only files that appear at the above location are:
Makefile
conf.py
cvbridge_python.rst
flann.patch
index.rst
mainpage.dox
manifest.xml
opencv2-python-link.patch
pythontest.patch
rosdoc.yaml

I poked around some of the tags as well but they all end up with this kind of short file list.  Has the source been moved somewhere?  Or am I just missing something obvious.
Thanks!
patrick

A:

Patrick,
Source for OpenCV library can be found here. What your link points to is the ROS wrapper which checks out the code from above location at build time.

A good first step when  you find a package that doesn't contain what you expect is to check it's Makefile(s) and CMakeLists.txt. For example, you can see from the OpenCV Makefile that it is using the svn_checkout.mk script (which is documented on the wiki somewhere).
