Q:

Topic List and Service List empty

I want to use the turtlebot3. Therefor I've installed ROS2 Humble on my PC and the RaspberryPi 4. After the successful bringup of the Turtlebot it looks like this:

But when I use the command ros2 topic list I only get this as a result:
/parameter_events
/rosout
I think this is also the reason why I cant control the TurtleBot with my  Keyboard.
Do you have any ideas what I've done wrong?
I'm not quite sure what else you could need from me. Feel free to ask.

A:

From the logs, you just launch the bringup nodes, so the robot was waiting the commands.
You should open a new terminal and launch the teleop launch. You can follow this guide, be sure to let the bringup terminal open and working.
To see that bringup works, you can look in the same guide the previous page
