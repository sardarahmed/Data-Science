Q:

openni_tracker using two Kinects problem

Dear friends.
I am new in ROS and I am trying to track the human skeleton by two different Kinects (from different angles and distances).
But I can not run the "openni_tracker" with two different nods like :

List item rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker image:=/Kinect_1/rgb/image_color
List item rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker image:=/Kinect_2/rgb/image_color

Just one of them works... and the other stoped by the ROS telling :

List item [ WARN] [1403525116.319161909]: Shutdown request received.
[ WARN] [1403525116.319206167]: Reason given for shutdown: [new node registered with same name]

Does any one know how I could run this node two time paralleled in my computer?
Also, in case of the possible answer, the "openni_tracker" publish the output as a tfMessage on "/tf" topic. In case of two nodes working (by two different" camera, what will be the output of this node?
Thanks

A:

I don't know if you can run the openni_tracker on 2 kinects, but in this case I think the problem is that the second node you run has the same name as the first, which is then stopped. So I suggest you to make a launch file where you launch 2 nodes with different names and different parameters.
