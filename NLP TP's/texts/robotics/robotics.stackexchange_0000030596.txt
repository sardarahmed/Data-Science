Q:

Obtaining coordinates of a point using pcd_viewer?

I am using pcd_viewer to visualize a point cloud.
rosrun pcl_visualization pcd_viewer <some-pcd-file>

I'd like to find the coordinates of single points. Is there any quick way to select the points in the graphical tool?
I know that you can toggle some options via keystrokes and on the command-line. I wonder whether I just missed this feature or whether it's implemented.

A:

Unfortunately you can't get the coordinate of a single point using pcd_viewer in pcl_visualization.
