Q:

Error: Config file has not been declared

HI
I am trying to build package: performance_test
It has a configuration file @ performance_test->cfg->performanceTest.cfg. package contains a simple publisher and subscriber.
Screen shot of my files is attached.Please zoom if isn't clear. Any help would be greatly appriciated.
Error: /home/nth/ocean_ws/src/performance_test/src/talker_node.cpp:21:41: error: ‘performance_test::performanceTestConfig’ has not been declared
   void configCallback(performance_test::performanceTestConfig &config, uint32_t level);

@BhanuKiran.Chaluvadi: please don't use screenshots to show something that is just text. Copy-paste the text into your question body and use the Preformatted Text button (the one with 101010 on it) to format it correctly.

A:

First, you should make sure the names defined in the cfg/performanceTest.cfg matches the names you used in you code.
Then you can try these.
In you CMakeLists.txt file, change line 30 to
add_dependencies(talker ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS}). Then shift this line to before the line of target_link() command. Do the same thing for your listener.
After changing the CMakeLists.txt, it should look like this,
add_executable(talker src/talker_node.cpp)
add_dependencies(talker ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS})
target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

add_executable(listener src/talker_node.cpp)
add_dependencies(listener ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS})
target_link_libraries(listener ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

Try to compile again, it may help.
