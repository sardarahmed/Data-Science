A:

AMCL is probably waiting for an initial pose. There are two ways to do this: using RVIZ, or using the parameter server:

This tutorial shows how to send an initial pose using RVIZ
you can set the pose via parameters using the amcl parameters initial_pose_x, initial_pose_y, initial_pose_a (see http://wiki.ros.org/amcl for a description of the parameters)

@fergs, I have the same problem, when I do "rostopic echo /amcl_pose", there is no messages!!!! I try rviz to set the initial pose, then we get the co-ordinate from rxconsole output..Is there any way to calculate robot position by listening to some topic?

hi,i have the same problem,when i use rostopic echo /amcl_pose  give me these warning:
WARNING: no messages received and simulated time is active.
Is /clock being published?
do you solve your problem?
