Q:

How to record NovAtel Raw Observation data in binary for post-processing

New here, is there a way to record raw binary data to a bagfile without using a ROS standard message?  I would like to post-process using RTKLIB.
Thank you

Are you using any ROS drivers for interfacing with the receiver? If so, please mention those, as there are a nr of different components, which probably all do things slightly differently.

I am using a ROS driver.  Here is the link: https://github.com/GAVLab/novatel.

A:

It doesn't have to be a standard message, but rosbag works with messages, so anything in there will have to be some message type.

Edit:

I am using a ROS driver.  Here is the link: https://github.com/GAVLab/novatel.

That driver seems to only publish NavSatFix and Odometry messages.
You could perhaps take a look at novatel_span_driver. Provided it is compatible with your hardware, that would seem to publish a lot of low-level data: see the novatel_msgs docs.

Would be nice if you could tell us what solution you've come up with. That would benefit future visitors of this board.
