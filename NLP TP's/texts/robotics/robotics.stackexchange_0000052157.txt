Q:

ROS Installation Instructions Broken?

We're trying to install ros on a new system, but during the key setup step, ubuntu is responding with an error claiming
wget: unable to resolve host address 'packages.ros.org'
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.

This occurs after attempting to execute
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

The same problem came up about a week ago on a different system, but it was fixable using
sudo gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring /etc/apt/secring.gpg --trustdb-name /etc/apt/trustdb.gpg --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv A258828C

(Which was scrounged up from the depths of an old wiki post)
However, this no longer works. Before this month, OpenPGP has never appeared during the ros installation process, but is now making it impossible to complete installation. Is there an easy way to resolve this?

This seems to be the case. For some reason, the system is unable to connect to the network, even on a wired connection.

I'm getting issues with sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116 timing out, tried sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 0xB01FA116 and get key B01FA116 not found on this server

and as soon as I posted this it worked

A:

This looks more like a connection problem. Maybe just trying again at a later time or using a mirror will fix that. I can currently ping packages.ros.org.
