Q:

TurtleBot Kinect object recognition package

I would like to use Kinect to recognize 2 objects (book, table), 2 people (adult and child), and 2 postures (stand or sit).
I am confused about OpenCV, OpenNI, PCL, TOD and many things like that. Do I need all of them or just one of them?
Any suggestion for a quick, simple vision package?
In the video "Introducing TurtleBot" in official website, it shows Skeleton Tracking, but what software are they using?
Thank you very much indeed for your help.

Take a look at this answer: http://answers.ros.org/question/72511/any-ros-node-for-people-legs-tracking.  Maybe http://wiki.ros.org/people_tracker is (part of) what you need

A:

OpenNI and NITE provides people skeleton detection & tracking using the Kinect, but it requires a static background and when your robot moves, it may fail in tracking. You can find samples in NITE official site and OpenNI official site

Its really good thanks, did you manage to make it work? Because right now I'm unable to make it work.  And I would really appreciate some help, thanks.

@K Chen does it work with a moving camera? or only with a camera that is still?

@ctguell it works with a pre-provided camera matrix estimation, so if your camera is moving, you should update the parameters accordingly to make it working
