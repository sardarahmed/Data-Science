Q:

Importing android_core failed

Error on opening old working android_core project in Android Studio 0.3.4 (also in 0.2.0)
Error on importing new android_core project in Android Studio 0.3.4 (also in 0.2.0)
Till last week I was able to use the android_core project which I imported to Android Studio 0.3.1.
But when I opened it again yesterday (09.11)(in Android Studio 0.3.1) I was getting errors. On Sunday (10.11) I cloned a new android_core from the Github but I could not import it to Android Studio 0.3.1 (no error in catkin_make).
I upgraded to Android Studio 0.3.4 (also to 0.3.5) but the same errors on opening the old working android_core and also for importing a new one.
[Error on importing]
"Resolver error

ap:gradle_plugins:[0.1,0.2).

[Error on opening an old android_core]
"Gradle 'android_core' project refresh failed:

Then I degraded to Android Studio 0.2.0 tried again but it gave again the same errors.
I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and new to ROS. Is there any solution for the above errors ?
Thanks, dtc.

A:

Should use "./studio.sh" instead of "sudo ./studio.sh"
