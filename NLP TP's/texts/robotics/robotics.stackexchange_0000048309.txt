Q:

turtlebot teleop and follower apps do not work

Hello
I just received my Turtlebot 2/Kubiki base. It comes with Groovy pre-installed in the ASUS Laptop.
I wanted to start the two demo applications
So, I did
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

and
roslaunch turtlebot_follower follower.launch
As in Tutorial, I opened an ssh from my PC and run the launch files.
For "roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch" I get the following error:
IOError: Errno 13 Permission denied: '/home/turtlebot/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache/index'
[turtlebot_teleop_keyboard-1] process has died [pid 22131, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_teleop/scripts/turtlebot_teleop_key turtlebot_teleop_keyboard/cmd_vel:=cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop __name:=turtlebot_teleop_keyboard __log:=/home/turtlebot/.ros/log/f6daa71c-7692-11e2-8049-446d57c5292a/turtlebot_teleop_keyboard-1.log].

all processes on machine have died, roslaunch will exit
shutting down processing monitor...

and for "roslaunch turtlebot_follower follower.launch" I get the following error:

Any help?

What user do you use for ssh?
Comment by Anis on 2013-02-14:
I used "ssh turtlebot@IP_ADDRESS_TURTLEBOT" I also executed the demo from turtlebot itsefl and the same problem occurs

That should be correct. I don't know how their default image is set up. A fix might be to re-run sudo rosdep init, rosdep update, but maybe it's supposed to work differently, so I don't give any guarantees that this doesn't interfere somewhere else.

Can you teleop from the Turtlebot Laptop? If yes, then it is connection problem. If not, then it is ROS problem.
Comment by lawr on 2013-05-02:
exactly the same problem happened to me, could you give me a hint about what should I do?

A:

AFAIK there was a bug in the tutorial. delete the .ros directory manually and rerun the rosdep commands above should fix this.
