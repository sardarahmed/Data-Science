Q:

syntax for wstool set?

If you want to specify a version of a catkin package to install (--version -new) how do you do this?
wstool set rosconsole_bridge https://github.com/ros/rosconsole_bridge.git --git --version-new -y

or
wstool set rosconsole_bridge https://github.com/ros/rosconsole_bridge.git --git --version-groovy -y

or is there something I'm doing wrong in my syntax?
