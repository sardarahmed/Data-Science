Q:

Subscriber error in ROS

This is my subscriber declaration followed by the callback function

message_filters::Subscriber<geometry_msgs::Point32>
point_sub(*nh, "tracked_point", 1);
point_sub.registerCallback(&visualservoing3D::pointCallback);

The callback declaration is

void
visualservoing3D::pointCallback(const
geometry_msgs::Point32ConstPtr& msg) {
//Some functions }

But the following error pops up. I know its something to do with my subscriber.

/usr/include/boost/function/function_template.hpp:225:
error: no match for call to
‘(boost::mfi::mf1<void,
visualservoing3D, const
boost::shared_ptr<const
geometry_msgs::Point32std::allocator<void

&>) (const boost::shared_ptr<const geometry_msgs::Point32_std::allocator<void
&)’

Thanks,
Nagsaver

It might be due to your subscriber having point32 rather than Point32.

It is capital P in the code. Dont know how it changed in my question. Everywhere I have Point32

A:

Your callback function is a class member of the class visualservoing3D. Using a class member as callback function is not the same as using a normal function.
You have to provide the class member of the class and the object.
See this example: http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers#Class_Methods
