Q:

Mobile robot simulation with which simulator?

Hi there,
i want to create a simulation for a mobile robot (lunar rover) in a specific environment with consideration of dust and rocks and so on. The main focus will be on navigation with LIDAR and/or stereo vision and the handling characteristics in the lunar testbed. The simulation should be as most real as possible.
Should i use Gazebo, V-REP or an other simulator to do this? Is there any paper with a comparison of the use of simulators for mobile platforms?
Best regards Max

A:

This paper: http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~gudwin/courses/IA889/2014/IA889-02.pdf [1] describes a set of experiments comparing V-rep and Gazebo for simulation.
It is a fairly old paper but the results still hold true in my experience.
Simulation is V-rep with the rocky environment can be easily constructed while that in Gazebo may be harder. You can also add the LiDAR and 3D camera sensors on the robot while using the Lua child scripts to publish messages on topics to interface with ROS. See RosInterface: http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/rosInterf.htm
Hope this helps.
