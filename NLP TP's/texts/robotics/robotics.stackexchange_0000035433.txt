Q:

Yaw angle of lse_xsens_mti behaves weirdly

I ran the lse_xsens_mti driver on my robot . I  had it turn 360 degrees at a uniform velocity, and computed the Yaw angle output by the driver data in two ways:

Using the  tf::getYaw()   function on the quat formed by the orientation.x,y,z,w values output by imu/data.

By atan2(w,z)*2  on the z and w values.

In both cases, the Yaw angle didn't vary uniformly with time as the robot turned. What could be wrong?

The lse_xsens_mti driver did not see much testing since it was created, I will take a look at it and update it soon!

A:

Apparently there was a bug on MTi.h discovered by Prof. Dr. Stefan May which as already been corrected. Could you please verify that the software now works as expected?
