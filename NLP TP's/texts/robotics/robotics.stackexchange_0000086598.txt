Q:

How to use cv_camera with IP cameras?

Hello, I am trying to use cv_camera with an IP camera. I am not sure how to initialize cv_camera such that it can read a cv_camera.
My understanding is that this would be done through setting the 'device_id' parameter. However, when I tried to set it to an http stream, it activated my laptop camera instead.
I did more experimenting and discovered that device_id only worked if it was set to an integer. I thought that the device_id parameter was passed to an instance of Videocapture cap(device_id) but this does not seem to be the case. I tried calling the address of an attached webcam directly '/dev/video1' but that did not work. I experimented with different cv paths as specified here:
http://funvision.blogspot.ca/2017/06/opencv-reading-ip-camera-video-stream.html
but I haven't been able to get anything besides integer inputs to device_id to work.
Any assistance or insight would be appreciated. Thank you for your time.
EDIT: There is another parameter called device_path that is documented on the github page.

I've just accepted it for you.

A:

There is another parameter called device_path that is documented on the github page. This allows you to specify a cv_stream.
