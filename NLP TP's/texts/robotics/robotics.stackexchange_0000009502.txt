Q:

Use data from gyroscope to calculate orientation

From a gyroscope I'm getting angular velocities [dRoll, dPitch and dYaw] as rad/s, sampled at intervals dt = 10ms.
How do I calculate the short term global orientation (drift ignored) of the gyroscope?
Pseudo code would be helpful.

A:

gyroscopes do not measure [dRoll ,...] they measure body rates. These are not the same things. There is a transformation matrix ( that I do not have on hand) that relates body rates to euler rates. The euler rates are then integrated to get the short term change in orientation. 
-- relation --
this is the relation between the measured body rates from the imu and the euler rates.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euler_rates}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot \phi \\ 
\dot \theta \\ 
\dot \psi
\end{bmatrix} 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \sin\phi \tan\theta & \cos\phi \tan\theta \\ 
0 & \cos\phi & -\sin\phi \\ 
0 & \frac{\sin\phi}{\cos\theta} & \frac{\cos\phi}{\cos\theta}
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
p \\ 
q \\ 
r
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{equation}
where $\left[ p, q, r \right] ^T$ are the body rates measured from the imu.
