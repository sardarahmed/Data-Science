Q:

Hello everyone, I have a question. How to add dependencies for package.
For example, when I compilling program that used WiringOP library:
g++ progname.cpp  -lwiringPi -lpthread

So, question is how to add this dependencies in catkin workspace.

A:

You'll want to add the names of the libraries you need to link against to the target_link_libraries tag for the node in your CMakeLists.txt file as shown below:
Change the line:
add_executable(<your_node_name> src/progname.cpp)
target_link_libraries(<your_node_name> ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

To:
add_executable(<your_node_name> src/progname.cpp)
target_link_libraries(<your_node_name> ${catkin_LIBRARIES} wiringPi pthread)

Hope this helps.
