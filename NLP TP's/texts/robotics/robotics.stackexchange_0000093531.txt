Q:

Obtain covariance of pose estimation from ORB-SLAM2

Hi there,
I am trying to fuse pose estimation data obtained from ORB-SLAM2 with IMU data using the robot_localization package.
However, this package requires the pose estimation to be provided according to the geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped message type. I know how to obtain the pose estimation from ORB-SLAM, is there a way to get the covariance that corresponds to this pose estimation?
Thanks in advance!

Thanks for the answer! In that case I'll indeed use trial and error.

A:

ORB-SLAM doesn't provide covariance, for such case you will have to try hit and trial
