Q:

robot model does not appear in rviz melodic

I try to bring my robot model (which I have developed for kinetic) to work under melodic.
Everything works so far (despite some plugin issues where I have already committed a pull request), but not the visualization of the robot model.
The xacro description of the robot is here.
rviz visualization under melodic:

rviz visualization under kinetic:

Here are some points which I have investigated already:

I've checked the model on the parameter server via rosparam get /amiro1/robot_description under kinetic and melodic and they are identical.
The dae model is also valid, because rviz complains when I just manipulate the mesh location.
The wired thing is, that the hokuyo dae mesh is visualized under melodic.
I also check all rviz debug messages via rqt_logger_level and rviz tells me that the URDF description is loaded correctly.
Maybe it is realted to this issue but again, the hokuyo dae is shown, but not my robot.

If one would like to test it, follow these steps:

checkout https://github.com/tik0/amiro_robot.git
checkout https://github.com/tik0/amiro_msgs.git
build and run roslaunch amiro_gazebo amiro_simple_world.launch

Can anyone help me with this issue?

A:

Other rviz users have encountered a similar issue at https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/1249. The solution may be related to your locales.
If that's the underlying issue, modifying the following environment variable will fix it for you:
export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8".

Setting this variable solved the issue indeed, thanks.

that worked, thx
If you want to make it in system;
echo 'LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/locale
