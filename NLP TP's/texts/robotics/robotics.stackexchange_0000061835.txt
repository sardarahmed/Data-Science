Please provide more information. Incluidng all the commands to reproduce your error. as well as the full error in the console. Just copy and paste the whole sequence from the terminal.

A:

If you used the exact command above the problem is with the brackets. Try:
   sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-tutorials

Otherwise you will have to paste more info.
