Q:

bno055 IMU doesn't give absolute orientation

Hello,
For my robot I am using the Adafruit bno055 9DOF absolute orientation IMU. However, the orientation given is relative to it's starting position, not the magnetic north pole.
I have tried using the rtimulib_ros package as well as ros-imu-bno055 but in both cases the result is the same.
I know the magnetometer is working since I can see its output in one of the topics published by ros-imu-bno055 and those values change if I move a magnet close to it, but I'll admit that I don't really know how to interpret that data so I'm not sure what kind of value I should be seeing.
The IMU connected to a Jetson Nano via I2C.
Thanks!

A:

That is expected behavior. Its absolute orientation relative to startup. Some IMUs wonâ€™t even do that fusion for you.

I see. Is there an existing package that will allow me to use the magnetometmer to set the origin to the magnetic north?

hi @jeremie, I've been working on a ROS2 bno055 package for awhile now with plans on adding I2C support relatively shortly.  might be of interest to you:
