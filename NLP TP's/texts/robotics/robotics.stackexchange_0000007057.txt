Q:

How to control Brushless Motor+ESC with BeagleBone?

I can't really find a real straightforward tutorial for that. There are a lot for Arduino but I only have an original beaglebone, an ESC, and brushless motor with me. Please help.

A:

You will need to output a servo PWM signal with a 20ms period and a pulse width generally between 1 and 2ms depending on your ESC, Here is some information about using the PWM output on a beaglebone, and here is an article describing controlling a servo with a beaglebone, it is the same as an ESC.
