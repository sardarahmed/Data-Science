Q:

How can I convert PointCloud2 to PointCloud?

Hi !  I have some problems when I run a "laser-perception.launch" of PR2. The errors are:
Client [/point_cloud_assembler] wants topic /tilt_scan_cloud_filtered to have datatype/md5sum [**sensor_msgs/PointCloud**/d8e9c3f5afbdd8a130fd1d2763945fca], but our version has [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2/1158d486dd51d683ce2f1be655c3c181]. Dropping connection

and  so is the topic /tilt_scan_cloud. The topics' type is sensor_msgs/PointCloud2.
So I think the solution is that PointCloud2 should be converted to PointCloud. But I don't know how convert PointCloud2 to PointCloud in a launch file.  thank you so much.

My ROS is fuerte. the "laser-perception.launch" is in http://wiki.ros.org/motion_planning_environment/Tutorials/Making%20collision%20maps%20from%20self-filtered%20tilting%20laser%20data

A:

via @neil-traft:
Your question is covered in the PCL Overview. In particular, you can either run the point_cloud_converter node, or you can use sensor_msgs::convertPointCloud2ToPointCloud.
