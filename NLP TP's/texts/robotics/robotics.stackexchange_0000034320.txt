Q:

AttributeError: Fedora instance has no attribute error

rosmake ros_comm
AttributeError: Fedora instance has no attribute 'installers' I got this when I ran rosmake ros_comm. I installed ros as root on a glichy internet connection but I reran the install. So this is where I am at.

A:

This bug has been fixed in the code and will be available with the next update to ROS Electric.  For now, you should probably use ROS Diamondback if you are on Fedora.
