Q:

MAVROS coordinate system

Hi, I'm using mavros with PX4 firmware.
I wonder that the values of the orientation published (in quaternion format) are in which coordinate system.
I'm not meaning NED or ENU but the world coordinate or body coordinate.
Please let me know which one is right?

The orientation value is th body position in the world coordinate system.
The orientation value is th world position in the body coordinate system.
