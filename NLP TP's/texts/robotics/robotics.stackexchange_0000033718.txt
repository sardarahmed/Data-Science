Q:

Why is the directory layout of Diamondback different when compiling from source?

I have installed ROS Diamondback from source, following the guidelines here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Arch. Now, for Ubuntu installations I created a rosinstall
file that contains (besides other stuff) the following entries
other: { local-name: /opt/ros/diamondback/ros }
other: { local-name: /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks }

When compiling from source (Desktop-Full) on archlinux, there is no stacks directory. When installing Diamondback via aptitude on Ubuntu, there is a stacks directory. This is both puzzling because I expect the final result of compilation from source to be the same as when installed with some package manager. Also, this breaks the rosinstall file.
Why is the layout different? (maybe also: how to fix the rosinstall file?)

A:

Source trees and binaries installations frequently vary in layout for various reasons.  rosinstall is designed to give you a developer tree, whereas the binary installations are meant to be closer to a legal 'install' layout and support shared usage.  Different use cases result in differing layouts.

The exact layout does not need to be the same as long as your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is set appropriately to find the packages you want to use.
