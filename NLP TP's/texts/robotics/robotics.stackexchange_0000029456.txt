Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: pcl bag_to_pcd

I'm trying to convert a bagfile into pcd files using bag_to_pcd. But
everything I get is
[ERROR] [1297703460.328842013]: You requested a transform at time
1292497206.348,
but the tf buffer only contains a single transform at time 1292497207.122.
When trying to transform between /head_tof_link and /base_link.
What's wrong? Replaying the bag file using rosbag play seems to work
correctly.

A:

By default I believe that bag_to_pcd uses /base_link as the output TF transform. This should be exposed properly through
a parameter. You can either modify it yourself (line 133) and submit a patch, or ticket me and I'll make sure it gets fixed.
