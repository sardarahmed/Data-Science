Q:

Is the "byte" type in messages signed or unsigned?

It appears that moveit_msgs/CollisionObject uses the type byte which isn't discussed in the documentation for message types found at http://wiki.ros.org/msg .  Is this an alias for uint8, int8, or some form of message structure?

A:

From ros/msg - Message Description Specification - 2.1 Fields - 2.1.1 Field Types:

[..]
Deprecated:
    char: deprecated alias for uint8
    byte: deprecated alias for int8

So it is indeed an alias.
