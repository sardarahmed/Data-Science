Q:

Why dwa planner can't reach the target rotation?

I've commanded the robot to go to the green arrow position/rotation, so it went there and started rotating CCW until it got near the upper wall, then it got stuck in that position.
The question is why it don't go a bit forward so it can complete the rotation? Which parameters can be changed so that it better behave in situations like that?

Update:
It keeps writing in the logs:

[ INFO] [1501263591.230230037]: Got
new plan [ WARN]
[1501263591.260831641]: Invalid

and after some seconds:

[ERROR] [1501263591.331646239]:
Aborting because a valid control could
not be found. Even after executing all
recovery behaviors

Currently we have recovery_behavior_enabled = true and clearing_rotation_allowed = false

What's the output at the terminal?

@jayess I've updated the question with console output

A:

I believe it's because you have the clearing_rotation_allowed parameter set to false. It won't rotate to clear the cost map and replan, it'll just give up like you're seeing.
From the wiki, the clearing_rotation_allowed parameter

Determines whether or not the robot
will attempt an in-place rotation when
attempting to clear out space. Note:
This parameter is only used when the
default recovery behaviors are in use,
meaning the user has not set the
recovery_behaviors parameter to
anything custom.

I'll try to enable that, but that behavior has given me problems in the past (like colliding with walls). However, I can't understand why it can't finish the move without resorting to the recovery behaviors, as it would be a simple movement to get out of there
