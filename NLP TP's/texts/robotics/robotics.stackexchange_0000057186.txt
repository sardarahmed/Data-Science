Q:

openni.launch creates a different frames tree for the Kinect

I am using openni pkg on a PR2 that has a kinect sensor attached and running goovy. I need to be able to transform between the camera frame and the PR2 links.
When I launch openni :
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

A different camera frame tree is created that is not connected to the PR2
I tried changing the camera parameter for the openni_launch to be head_mount_kinect but that din't bring the camera tf frames back on the tree.
The only possible solution that I found is to add another fixed frame to tf specifying that the camera and the head_mount_kinect are the same frame with no translation or rotation between them.
That seems to much of a hack, is there a more elegant solution?

A:

You should use the openni launch file that shipped with the PR2; I believe it's in /etc/ros/openni_head.launch alongside robot.launch.

Thanks Austin that worked. I figured also I could use the launch file from the rgbd_assembler: openni_node_new.launch
