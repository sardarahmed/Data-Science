Q:

robot_localization: navsat transform node does not publish

According to tutorial about GPS Integration and use of navsat transform node, i put into node the imu with absolute heading values, odometry that is the output of second instance of EKF and NavSatFix message.
The problem is that the node doesn't publish any data in /odometry/gps. I check the covariances of IMU and odometry message. I check also the value of lat/lon/h of GPS message because I have readed that one of this is NaN the navsat_transform node doesn't make output.
So, what is my fault?

Please post a sample message for all inputs, as well as your navsat_transform_node configuration.

A:

The error was in the wrong frame id of the imu message. I corrected it and now the navsat transform work properly.
Begineer mistake.

Could you explain what you mean by this a little more. I think I am having the same problem.

Yes I'd also like to know more about how you fixed this. I am having the same issue.
My Frame ID's are as follows:
IMU: base_link
Encoders: odom
GPS: gps
