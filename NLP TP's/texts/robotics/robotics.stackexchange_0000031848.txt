Q:

How are link names referenced for gazebo/SetLinkState?

In trying to use gazebo/SetLinkState I can't seem to figure out what to call the links to get gazebo to recognize them. I use the names I see published on "/gazebo/link_states". But everytime I use a link name that I know exists, it always replies with:
SetLinkState: link [My/Link/Name/Here_link] does not exist

I've tried many permutations including prefixing the link name with the model/robot name like:
Robot_Name/My/Link/Name/Here_link

to no avail.
TLDR: How are link names referenced? What is the magic formula for getting gazebo to recognize link names?

A:

It turns out the scope token for models is '::' so to get it to work, the link has to be referenced using a string like:
Robot_Name::My/Link/Name/Here_link

Currently the /gazebo/link_states topic does not publish the root scope (e.g. Robot_Name:: ) but this has been patched and the scope will be published along with the name in "Electric Turtle".
A patch for gazeboros in diamondback is available here.
