I'm looking for examples related to ros_control of differential drive robot.
Please list any real or simulated diff-drive robots (with source code references) that use ros_control.

A:

Here is a link to ros_control Git: https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/wiki . There are some code samples where you can learn about the basics of ros_control in there and you can take it from there. I think Universal Robots also use ros_control, double check about it though.
