Q:

Why Empty message in std_msg?

As in the title, I don't understand why is there an Empty type in std_msgs? What is it used for?
Thanks!

A:

It can be useful in situations where you don't particularly care about content of a message, but just that one has been received. Example: maybe a bump sensor would use an empty message because you just care that you hit something, there may be no other information available worth giving a client.
