Q:

Error while successful "sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full"

Hi all,
I got stuck while installation. See below for the detail. Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Phenom:

While running "sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full", after downloading a few hundred MB of data, it suddenly quitted and showed "E: Unable to locate package ros-diamondback-desktop-full". I did NOT touch the computer during the downloading period.

Output of apt-get update: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxY6w5v6jedHXnc3omkEwCkxlT4abejfEtz3tF-D9ek/edit?hl=en_US
<- For the ROS part, the result is the same on another computer that successfully installed diamondback.

Output of installable ROS packages on the computer. You'll see diamondback packages are missing: https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=10DGLH84UZKyXp1itsPAZl8S0m0ZdsVUZ1R8ZpSyiIfw

Tried workaround:

The things discussed in the pages below are already tried (incl. allowing universe & multi-universe etc.)

http://answers.ros.org/question/702/unable-to-find-install-package
http://answers.ros.org/question/120/troubles-installing-ros-c-turtle-base

sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/ros

Reboot OS.

"sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list" and start over.

Other: Another computer which is on the same network has successfully installed diamondback. And after apt-get update on the same machine, apt-get still shows ros-diamondback as installable packages.
Env: Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick, Kernel Linux 2.6.35-30-generic-pae
Thanks in advance.

@tfoote @Patrick Bouffard sorry again. I replaced with the new URL (turned out my setting on G-docs was correct though).
Comment by Patrick Bouffard on 2011-08-04:
Me either. Use pastebin, it's better.

I still can't follow the 2nd link.
Comment by 130s on 2011-08-04:
Oops, sorry. I switch to the original long URL, and also switched to public instead of "anyone with link" on G-docs.
Comment by Patrick Bouffard on 2011-08-03:
Your bit.ly link doesn't work--it apparently links to a Google Doc that isn't world readable. Maybe try pastebin instead.

A:

I found a workaround by myself. From mirror sites, I chose Case Western and did the same for the rest of steps.
Then I was able to see ros-diamondback* and now download is in process.
Before then, I also tried Maryland but it returned the same result with the issue above.

@tfoote thanks, I'm glad you've fixed the problem and also the mirror site did its job.

Yeah, we had a bug in our distro script which invalidated the entire repository on maverick.  It should be restored now.
