Q:

Combining Angle from AX12 Servo and data from Hokuyo Laser

Hello,
Currently I am trying to generate a 3D map using the AX12 Servo and Hokuyo Laser. As of now I can control the AX12 Servo using the Dynamixel_Tutorials found here and can start up the Hokuyo Laser using the Hokuyo Laser Drivers (tutorials can be found here). How do I get the servo to integrate the angle into the laser scan data so when it is run through rviz it will create a 3D map.

A:

You might want to look at the laser_assembler package that provides nodes that listen to streams of scans and then assemble them into a larger 3D Cartesian coordinate (XYZ) point cloud.
We have pretty much the same setup on our robot - tilting Dynamixel motor with a Hokuyo laser attached to it. I have written a node that interfaces with pr2_laser_snapshotter node to get the cloud each time the laser does a full profile (goes up and down). There's nothing terribly complicated in both of those nodes, one just tells the other when it's at the beginning/end of profile and the other calls out to laser_assembler to get the cloud at that point in time. You can write your own node if you have different requirements.
Look at bottom of this launch file for an example on how to launch these nodes.
