A:

There is a package called node_manager_fkie for managing nodes, topics and so on with a GUI. You can use launch files as well as the buttons in the GUI to launch the nodes that are not running or crashed.

thanks for the reply. It helps me in a certain way. However, I failed to run some of the nodes. The error "usr/bin/screen is missing' appears. How can I fix this error? Does this have something to do with the OS that I am using?
