Q:

Geometric constraint in between two joints

Hi,
does there already exist a possibility to couple two joints by a geometric constraint like a chain drive, e.g. setting the same angle? If yes, how can I access it?
Thank you!

A:

There currently is nothing like a chain drive in gazebo. Feel free to contribute, or file a ticket for this feature on bitbucket.
