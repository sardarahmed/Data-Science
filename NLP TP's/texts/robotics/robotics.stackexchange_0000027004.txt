Q:

Gazebo 3.0 linking error

When compiling an executable for Gazebo 3.0, I get the following linking error:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lDepthCameraPlugin
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lGpuRayPlugin
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lRayPlugin
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lContactPlugin
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lCameraPlugin

I see that @hsu had the same issue and fixed it for Gazebo 1.9:
pull-request 616
I compiled Gazebo 3.0 from source following this tutorial.
Here is the output from: dpkg -l gazebo | grep gazebo
ii  gazebo      1.9.5-1~precise      Gazebo simulator - Main package

Got rid of the error by removing gazebo_ros from find_package inside CMakeLists.
