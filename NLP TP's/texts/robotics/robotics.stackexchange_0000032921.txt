I have it in /opt/ros/diamondback, unfortunately don't know which ubuntu package.

I think this package does not come with the regular distribution of ROS Diamondback and has to be installed additionally
Comment by lakshmen on 2011-07-11:
just to clarify something. Does this package come with ros diamondback? it has to be downloaded.. Am i right?
Comment by Ivan Dryanovski on 2011-07-11:
Also, if you installed ROS from binaries, like the default instructions say, you can install the package from binaries too: "sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-turtlebot"

That stack is under Mercurial version control, not SVN. First, "sudo apt-get install mercurial". Next, "hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot"

to download just that package, i need to type svn co https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot   Am i right?

turtlebot is an iRobot Create based robot by WillowGarage, all its supporting software and drivers (including pointcloud_to_laserscan package) is released for ROS Diamondback.
