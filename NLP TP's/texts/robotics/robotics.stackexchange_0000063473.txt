Q:

Define service or action using adapted c++ message

I've took a class of my existing code and adapted it using this: http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/MessagesSerializationAndAdaptingTypes
It all works correctly. However, I would like to be able to define services and actions having this message as part of their definitions. If I simply write the .srv or .action files and use the name of the adapted type, it is not able to find it.
Is it possible to make the service/action generators to assume that the C++ version of a message already exist and not require a corresponding .msg file?

A:

I wanted to add another way of solving this problem which I found out, by defining services using adapted types, as it is done for adapting types for messages, which avoids requiring the message generator.
A brief explanation is here: http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/roscpp_traits/html/service__traits_8h_source.html
