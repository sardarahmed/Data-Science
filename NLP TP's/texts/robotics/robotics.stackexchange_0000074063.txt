Q:

Publishing a message in an interrupt

Hi,
I don't want to publish messages in while(ros::ok) loop, but rather when an interrupt is called. How can I do that?
I'm completely new to ROS, so please try to answer, so that I could understand it correctly.

A:

The closest thing to an "interrupt" in ROS is that ROS uses callbacks that get called when particular ROS events happen. For example, when creating a subscriber you provide a callback function that executes every time a message on a particular topic is received. You could easily publish a topic in a subscriber callback. There are also callbacks for service providers (which could also contain a publish command).
One thing you may be interested in is a Timer (Python and CPP). These allow you to specify a callback and a time period (as a ros::Duration). The callback will then be executed at the frequency specified by the time period. You can, of course, publish messages in that timer callback as well.
