Q:

Setting output file name for the ROS video recorder

I am using the video recorder to save a video stream to a file using ros, but  I am having trouble setting the filename parameter.
This is the command I am using

rosrun image_view video_recorder filename:="test" image:=/camera/color/image_raw

These are the messages in the terminal
[ INFO] [1548243269.519044136]: Waiting for topic /camera/color/image_raw...
[ INFO] [1548243269.722238288]: Starting to record MJPG video at [640 x 480]@15fps. Press Ctrl+C to stop recording.
[ INFO] [1548243271.470604124]: Recording frame 52
 Video saved as output.avi

The video is saved successfully, but it names the file "output" instead of "test" like I specified.
How do I set the filename parameter?
