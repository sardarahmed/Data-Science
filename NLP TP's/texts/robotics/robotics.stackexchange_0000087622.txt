Hi, could you please provide more details about your problem? Where did you get this package from? Does this package has a CMakeLists.txt and a package.xml file?

A:

The output from rospack profile gives you your answer: home/amburkoff/catkin_ws/src/joy_twist doesn't contain a Manifest, which every ROS package needs to have.  You might want to take a look at this tutorial to see how packages are normally created in ROS, or maybe use an example from another package.
