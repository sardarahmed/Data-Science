A:

Hi Iran,
I guess you are using ROS Fuerte, right? The package that was called motion_planning_msgs in Electric has been merged into arm_navigation_msgs in Fuerte, so it doesn't exist any more. My guess is that you still have some artifacts from an Electric build lying around somewhere. Can you delete the directories ~/.m2 and ~/.ros/rosjava/ and try again?
If that doesn't help, check that your environment variables are set up correctly. In particular, check that the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is correct (see "Environment setup" in the ROS installation instructions).
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH 

should say something like this (first some place(s) under your home dir where you put your own packages, then /opt/ros/fuerte stuff, no electric):
/home/martin/ros-fuerte:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks

UPDATE (solution): For later reference: In private communication with Iran, it turned out that the problem's cause was that an older revision of rosjava_core was built with electric, then rosjava_core was updated to the current tip and compiled with Fuerte. Removing the rosjava_core directory and cloning it fresh solved the problem.

Yes, I have ROS electric installed in my computer. but, as you suggested, I delete ~/.m2 and ~/.ros/rosjava/ and then I try ./gradlew install. Again I have the same error. Also,  my environment variable setup which was correct. any other suggestion? what about deleting the whole ROS electric?
