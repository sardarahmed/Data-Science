Q:

How does `hector_mapping` build the coordinate system?

Now I want to know the localization accuracy of hector_mapping, so I need to measure the actual position of the robot and compare it with the position of hector_mapping publish on slam_out_pose. As far as I know, after the cartographer starts, the direction in which the robot advances is defined as the positive direction of the x-axis, and then based on this coordinate system, the position information of the robot is output. Is hector_mapping based on such a mechanism to establish a coordinate system? If not, what is the `hector_mapping based on to establish the coordinate system?

A:

Yes, hector_mapping uses the standard ROS coordinate frame convention (see REP 103). It starts mapping at the zero pose (translations zero and identity quaternion) with x pointing forwards, y left, z up and estimates the robot pose relative to that.

Thank you,sir! After solving this problem, I have a new question: How to test the accuracy of hector_mapping's localization?

This depends on the application. A common way of testing a SLAM algorithms accuracy is testing loop closure performance.
