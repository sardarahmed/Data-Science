Q:

Rosws error trying to overlay common_msgs

Hi,
i just tried to setup my Fuerte workspace using rosws. This also includes an overlay of common_msgs and one package that depends on common_msgs. When I add the common_msgs stack to my workspace using "rosws merge" and try to build the package that depends on geometry_msgs, i get the following error when trying to rosmake:
[rosbuild] Building package morsetesting
  [rosbuild] Cached build flags older than manifests; calling rospack to get flags
  Failed to invoke /opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rospack cflags-only-I;--deps-only morsetesting
  Package geometry_msgs was not found in the pkg-config search path.
  Perhaps you should add the directory containing `geometry_msgs.pc'
  to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
  No package 'geometry_msgs' found

After removing the overlay of common_msgs (using "rosws remove"), i can build the package again... Is this a bug or am i missing something here?

I should mention that for my project, an overlay of common_msgs does not make sense any more since the python code is now stored outside of the rospackage anyway, but still iÂ´m interested in an answer...

A:

The common_msgs stack builds using catkin, not rosmake, now.
If you need to build it from source as an overlay, you will have to use the new tools.

Tanks. So i cannot mix packages that are build by catkin with packages built by rosmake... Would you recommend to replace rosmake-builds completely by catkin?

Not yet. Catkin building is not yet fully documented. I believe you can build and install something using catkin, then refer to the new version in other packages.
