Q:

Create new another workspace

I'm trying to create another workspace alongside with current existing one.
I have a working workspace named 'catkin_ws' my new workspace is 'reemron_ws'
when i do
cd ~/reemron_ws
and type
catkin_make
I'm getting the error:
The specified base path "/home/lizi/reemron_ws" contains a CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace
I pay attention that the CMakeList.txt in my new workspace is linked to other file.
This is the output of ls -l (in reemron_ws folder)
lrwxrwxrwx 1 lizi lizi   49 Apr 30 14:07 CMakeLists.txt -> /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake
I know the error says that catkin_make must run from the root of the workspace but I'm at the root of the workspace.
And suggestions?

A:

The problem was i run the command:
catkin_init_workspace
at the root of the workspace instead at /src
I delete the folder and create again and its OK.
