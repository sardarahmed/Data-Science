Q:

Error Installing ROS indigo on ubuntu 15.10

Hi,
I am trying to install ROS indigo on Ubuntu 15.10. I am following the tutorials given here:
 http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

When I enter the command
 sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full 

I get the error
"Unabe to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full"

I thought there was something wrong with sources.list file but when I opened it in gedit, the restricted, universe , and multiverse lines are already uncommented. I managed to follow all the steps from 1.1 to 1.4 up until i had to enter
  sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

Which gives me the error mentioned above. Please advise!

A:

In installation page of the wiki, it states;

Setup your computer to accept software
from packages.ros.org. ROS Indigo ONLY
supports Saucy (13.10) and Trusty
(14.04) for debian packages.

Therefore you may not be able to install debian packages on 15.10

The answer on this post says "You can always try building ROS from source if you are stuck on 15.10.". Do you know what this means?

As it tells in that answer, instead on installing ROS using debian package, you can download the source code and build packages on your operating system. Details are here: http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Source

I've succeeded building some part of ROS Indigo on 15.10, That doesn't mean anything will work, but at least the core stuff works. If you'd need to satisfy some dependency that doesn't have a package in 15.10, you may try playing with /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d and create your own dep mapping.
