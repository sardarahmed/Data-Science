Q:

Help with rplidar and autuonmus navigation

Hello everyone
I'm a beginner on ROS, I'm trying to make an autuonmus robot using an rplidar and encoder.
Here is what I have done so far

I installed ROS kinetic on a Raspberry pi 3
I got the rplidar running and I can get the data on rviz map
I have my encoders and motors controlled by a UNO Arduino

Now, I'm stuck on the next step
I don't how to use the rplidar data, I'm not sure if I need to install any more packages ( like SLAM )
and I also, I have no clue how to connect my raspberry pi ( ROS ) to the arduino and transfer the rplidar data to the motor
PLEASE help with a clear ( step by step ) on what to do so I can make my research based on that.
Thank you

There are many questions here. I suggest that to get better help, you break your question into many, directed questions that are ROS-related.

Thank you for the editing, I actually don't want detailed answers. Just a step by step on what need to be done.
thanks

Hello,
You will first need to get familiar with the navigation stack. I found it helpful to go over some tutorials with an existing robot such as the turtlebot or clearpath husky for autonomous navigation. By going over these tutorials, you should become familiar with things like move_base (local and global path planners and their parameters). After this, you may use a package such as this which allows you to use your rplidar to conduct hector slam. Keep in mind that this package is only for mapping, you will still need to launch move_base in order to achieve navigation.
Hope that helps,
Aaron
