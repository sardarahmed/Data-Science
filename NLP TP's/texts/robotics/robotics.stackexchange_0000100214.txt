Q:

Using multiple laser scans for gmapping

Hi, I'm trying to do the SLAM mapping with gmapping on my robot, which has 2 lasers on it, in the font and in the back of the robot. So how can I use 2 laser scans for gmapping, since gmapping only subscribes 1 /scan topic ?

You can also do a search on merge scans in the dialog box at the top of this page, and you will get a lot of hits. If you find a solution that someone else made that works for you, you can help out the community by answering your own question and providing a url.

A:

Thanks to Mike Scheutzow's help, I have merged my scans for gmapping, by following this question. it worked like a charm, using two lidars helps the mapping process much faster and as accurate as using only one lidar.

I'm glad you found a solution.
The question you point at appears to use the laserscan_multi_merger from https://github.com/iralabdisco/ira_laser_tools
