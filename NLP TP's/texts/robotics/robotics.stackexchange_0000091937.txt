Q:

2d navigation robot setup dependency

So I am doing a 2d navigation and am using create_autonomy for irobot
I am following this tutorial
In it I need to create a package with dependency:
my_tf_configuration_dep
my_odom_configuration_dep
my_sensor_configuration_dep

if I am using create_autonomy package and urg_node package do I still need to create those dependency? If so how?
Update:
I created move_base with dependency of move_base urg_node and ca_driver.

A:

I believe what you need is an equivalent of my_tf_configuration_dep.
create_autonomy (specifically, ca_driver) provides odometry on a topic and the transform from the odometry frame to the base frame on /tf. And urg_node is providing sensor data.
Specifically, I think you need to provide the transform from your robot base to your range finder. There are a few ways you could do this. Assuming that your range finder will not be moving with respect to the robot base, you could use a static transform publisher. For example:
rosrun tf2_ros static_transform_publisher X Y Z YAW PITCH ROLL base_footprint laser

I'm assuming that the robot base and range finder frames are base_footprint and laser, but these are configurable in create_autonomy and urg_node respectively. You should replace X Y Z YAW PITCH ROLL with the actual transformation from base_footprint to laser.
Launch file equivalent:
<launch>
  <node pkg="tf2_ros" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_to_laser_broadcaster"
             args="X Y Z YAW PITCH ROLL base_footprint laser" />
</launch>

Other options are to describe your robot configuration with URDF and publish the transform using robot_state_publisher (tutorial1,  tutorial2) or, publish the laser transform from code (tutorial).

oh you mean this: rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 base_link laser 100?
I have this already so I just need to configs and launch file then?
So then I just need to do: catkin_create_pkg my_robot_name_2dnav move_base
instead of catkin_create_pkg my_robot_name_2dnav move_base my_tf_configuration_dep my_odom_configuration_dep my_sensor_configuration_dep ?

That sounds about right to me. Maybe you can replace the "my_configuration_*" dependencies with the actual packages you are depending on e.g. ca_driver and urg_node.

Okay I will try that. Oh and I don't need the robot_configuration launch file right? just the move_base launch file

@jacobperron I updated my progress. Now it just spins alot. Here's a link to it: http://answers.ros.org/question/325237/2d-navigation-goal-robot-spinning-even-when-disconnected/
