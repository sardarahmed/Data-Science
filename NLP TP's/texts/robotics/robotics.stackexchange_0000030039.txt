Q:

Time jumped forward

Hi folks,
I am receiving some error messages from everything that uses planning_environment (OMPL, Trajectory Filter, you name it!), namely that the joint_states messages are discarded and I should turn DEBUG on. When I look at the DEBUG messages, I see a dominant "Time jumped forward by xxx for timer of period [0.010000], resetting timer". Although I don't think that that is the problem, I was curious about this message. What does it mean? Is it bad?
BTW I am currently distributing the nodes among at least 3 computers. Although they query a local ntp server every minute, keeping them in sync is a big problem. How influential is this on the tf synchronisation problems?

A:

If synchronization between different contributing machines is off, this can generally cause a lot of problems with tf. The recommendation is to use chrony (http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/) instead of plain ntp for synchronization, as it is much more reliable.
There are quite a few posts on the mailing list about details:
