Q:

Does anyone have a Simulink library model to publish to ROS

Hi all,
I was wondering if anyone knows how to publish to ROS from Simulink?  I'd like to simply drop down a library block with a mask and then enter the publisher in the mask.  The data can be run in an Inport and the publisher can be declared in an external C file.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
Jason

A:

I have no direct experience with any Simulink <-> ROS bridges, but there are several options that might work for your use case:

Simulink <-> OROCOS: using the orocos-simulink-toolbox. OROCOS then has a ROS transport
ROS <-> Matlab: several implementations exist, see the groovy/Planning/Matlab page for an overview. From there you might be able to create an S-function block (although according to this answer, that could be hard / impossible)
ros_simulink: this one doesn't seem to be included on the Groovy planning page. Seems a bit stale (last commit: 3 years ago)
write your own (MEX and / or S-function) using the appropriate roscpp libraries (again, see this answer for some details)
