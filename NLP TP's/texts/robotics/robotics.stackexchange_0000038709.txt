Q:

Turtlebot bringup minimal.launch, cannot find create on dev/ttyUSB0

Every day I start up my turtlebot, I have the same problem with minimal.launch. Every day, I have to fix it, seemingly through random chance. I get it working, but it takes a significant amount of time everyday. I've looked through every post on the subject many times, and have added rules to give permissions to udev, but every day I have the same problem and simply have to get lucky in reboot.
Even if the create USB is assigned USB0, sometimes it doesn't work.
Can I go in and change the minimal launch so that it's looking for a SYNNAME for create instead of just looking at ttyUSB0?
Then making a rule in udev/rules.d like this:
KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", SYSFS{serial}==SERIAL_OF_USB_CABLE, SYMLINK+="turtlebot"
So my real question is if I do this in minimal.launch, are there going to be problems in the code later where instead of looking for turtlebot, the code is simply looking for ttyUSB0.
Thanks

Are you stopping the turtlebot service before running minimal.launch?

A:

The turtlebot_node has a parameter for what the port is.  You will have to modify the launch file to set that parameter differently if you want to change the port name.
