Q:

Install gazebo-1.9 stand-alone with ros-groovy on Ubuntu12.04

I intalled ros-groovy before, then installed gazebo-1.9.5 according to gazebo_ros_pkgs tutorial. But when I tried to execute command

rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

or

rosrun gazebo_ros-1.9 gazebo

the result is

[rospack] Error: stack/package gazebo not found

or

[rospack] Error: stack/package gazebo-1.9 not found
.
roscore and gazebo-1.9 worked well when ran them one by one.
So please can someone help me find out what's the problem and where is wrong? Thank you.

A:

This looks like gazebo_ros is not s is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or not even installed
to verify that it is try this:
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

and see if you can find the path to the gazebo_ros folder. As suggested by your link, if you are on groovy you need to install the gazebo_ros package from source, which is also described in the link you shared, try the steps in there again and let me know if that worked.
cheers
EDIT:
I just checked the installation guide for groovy and it seems to me that in the instructions it never actually switches to the groovy-devel branch but would only rename the ros_gazebo_pkgs folder to groovy-devel, so use the this command instead:
git clone https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs.git -b groovy-devel

(@OSRF, you could maybe update this in the wiki, if I'm not telling any wrong stuff here ;), I am still on my roadtrip and wasn't following the latest developments)

it is the same problem for hydro (although it is the master branch)
git clone https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs.git hydro-devel

Hey guys thanks for catching that git syntax error. I just fixed it for both the groovy and hydro instructions.

Thanks for your reply. Sorry to give you feedback so late. I have reinstalled gazebo_ros from source just as described in the link. But there is still no gazebo_ros folder in the path returned by "echo $ROS_PACKAGE_ROS" which is "/opt/ros/groovy/share:/opt/ros/groovy/stack" on my machine. But I can find folder "gazebo_ros" in the path "catkin_ws/build/gazebo_ros_pkgs", which "catkin_ws" is my workspace folder for ros. I suspect whether I need to add a ROS_PACKAGE_PATH manully.

BTW your suggestion about git commad works well. I am going to update wiki for it. Thank you

Issue is solved. It's my mistake. I did not run commad ""echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc"". Sorry for stupid mistake!
