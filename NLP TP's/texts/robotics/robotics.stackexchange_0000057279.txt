Q:

bash: sketchbook: No such file or directory

I have the package and the IDE installed, now I want to copy ros_lib from the rosserial package to the sketchbook library folder which is has been created.
I used this command lines;-

roscd rosserial_arduino/libraries

cp -r ros_lib /libraries/ros_lib

but unfortunately I get this error msg

bash: sketchbook: No such file or directory

Why is this happen?

Are You sure, there is a sketchbook directory in Your current dir? You might just did a typo or something simple like that :)
$ ls | grep sketchbook

There is nothing came out. Sorry, I'm still new to this. How can I get it into my current directory?

Sorry, You should provide more information to get a clear answer. Why don't You try copy those files using    Desktop Environment and File Manager like Nautilus or something like that?

A:

You are supposed to replace  with the directory of your Arduino sketchbook (typically this defaults to ~/sketchbook)
EDIT: Furthermore, that's not the right way to setup rosserial_arduino, see http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
