Q:

xv-11-lidar cannot find the right port

I am using ubuntu mate 20.04 focal and i have installed ros noetic,
i'm following the following tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node
when i try to run the following command
rosrun xv_11_laser_driver neato_laser_publisher port_:=/dev/ttyACM0
I get the following error: [ERROR] [1582038870.703246684]: Error instantiating laser object. Are you sure you have the correct port and baud rate? Error was open: No such file or directory
in the tutorial when i try to run the following command it says "error file doesn't exist"
echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", SYMLINK+="sensors/ftdi_%s{serial}"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/52-ftdi.rules
when i change 52-ftdi.rules to the actual file that is in the rules.d folder which is 70-snap.snapd.rules
it says "permission denied"
when i run dmesg -w i get the following output
usb 1-1.2: Product: USB Serial
usb 1-1.2: Manufacturer: Teensyduino
usb cdc_acm 1-1.2:1.0 ttyACM0: USB ACM device
when i run lsusb i get the following
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 046d:c077 Logitech, Inc. M105 Optical Mouse
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 1a2c:2124 China Resource Semico Co., Ltd
Bus 001 Device 008: ID 16c0:0483 Van Ooijen Technische Informatica Teensyduino Serial
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 046d:0892 Logitech, Inc. OrbiCam
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2109:3431 VIA Labs, Inc. Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
i'm not sure if the problem is because the rosrun instruction isn't getting the right port? if this is the problem then how do i change the permissions in the 70-snap.snapd.rules file? or if the problem is due to something else?
the lidar does turn when i plug it in and as far as i can tell it's not a hardware issue.....
please help me

A:

You may not have enough permission to execute the device file.
( /dev/ttyACM0 exists, but cannot be opened from neato_laser_publisher )
$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

and then run
$ rosrun xv_11_laser_driver neato_laser_publisher port_:=/dev/ttyACM0

You can also try

i tried running sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
but it still gave me the same error
[ERROR] [1582038870.703246684]: Error instantiating laser object. Are you sure you have the correct port and baud rate? Error was open: No such file or directory

$ ls /dev/tty*
What do you see when you do this? Does /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 exist?

it worked after i ran sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0 and then re-did a catkin_make so thanks

However, when i run rosrun rviz rviz it's not showing any output from the lidar which so i'm not sure what that means?

You will need to configure rviz. Add the scan topic display. This is becoming different from the original question, so please create another question if this comment does not solve the problem.
