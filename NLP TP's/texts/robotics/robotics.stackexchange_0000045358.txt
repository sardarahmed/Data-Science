Q:

Libfreenect drivers for ROS

Hello all,
I am trying to use the old libfreenect drivers on the ROS.org website. But I can't seem to be able to install them using apt-get install ros-fuerte-kinect. Does anyone know how I can get these drivers?
Moreover, am I able to have libfreenect and openni drivers on the same machine with ROS?
Thanks in advance!
Kind Regards,
Martin

A:

There has recently been some discussion about this on the ros-users mailing list.
In summary, there is on-going work to provide a libfreenect driver that is compatible with the openni driver interfaces.

A few things have changed since the last discussion. The driver is now documented at http://ros.org/wiki/freenect_stack. v0.0.2 has been released.

Thanks a lot Piyushk, I have installed the freenect_stack now and it compiled with zero errors (on one of the two machines in the lab, very strange). I will post a new question with the errors in the libfreenect stack and maybe someone can shed some light on the subject
