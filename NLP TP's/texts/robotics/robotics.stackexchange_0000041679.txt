Q:

How to create a map data for navigation stack using kinect

I'd like to ask that

how to use pointcloud_to_laserscan
Can rgbdslam package be used for creating a map for navigation stack?

I'd like to create a map data with kinect sensor for navigation.
I've already read some tutorials and found that
I have to use not cloud data but laser scan data.
pointcloud_to_laserscan can convert data, but
the usage is not described in the wiki.
Could you teach me how to use it?
And I found that rgbdslam can create a map using kinect.
Is this package able to generate a map for navigation stack?

A:

RGBDSlam is the best choice if you have both the rgb and depth stream, but Depthimage_to_laserscan is better if you only have the depth data (my project is like this).
Depthimage_to_laserscan requires two things, the depth image topic and the camera_info topic (see monocular camera calibration tutorials). You'll also need to set up a coordinate frame to reference the kinect to. For example, with my stationary kinect 360, I use these:
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 map camera_depth_frame 20

rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan depthimage_to_laserscan image:=/kinect/mono16/image_raw camera_info:=/kinect/mono16/camera_info _scan_height:=20 _scan_time:=0.167 _range_min:=0.75 _range_max:=2.5

You'd probably want to use a larger scan height if possible, but my slow little raspberry pi cannot handle much more than 640x40 at 6fps, so im limited in height.
After that, you'll see a new /scan topic. Use that in place of a laser scanner as described in the navigation stack tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup
