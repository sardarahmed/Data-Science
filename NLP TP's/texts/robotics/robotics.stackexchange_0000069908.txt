Q:

Is there a way to get a parameter from the Parameters Server as unsigned type?

I would like to interpret a parameter in the .launch file as unsigned int, but I can't find (in ROS indigo) a function getParam() that accepts an unsigned int& as second parameter.
Are there any other solutions except from casting the variable?
Thanks in advance.

A:

No, I am afraid casting is the only feasible option.
