Q:

Which unit is Gazebo using when publishing to joint_states?

Hello.
I'm wondering which unit Gazebo is using when publishing to the topic joint_states. According to the message definition it could be (for the velocity) rad/s or m/s.
I would appreciate any hint about that.
BR, Florian

whats the type of joint ?

A:

As per ROS REP 103: Standard Units of measure and Coordinate Conventions, units in Gazebo should be specified in meters and kilograms. (...)
https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html
It seems to depend on the controller:
http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control#Controllers
https://answers.gazebosim.org//question/4205/joint_state-ros-topic-from-gazebo-and-ros_control/
and the joint type being controlled (http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/joint):

 (required only for revolute
and prismatic joint)
An element can contain the following
attributes:

lower (optional, defaults to 0)

An attribute specifying the lower joint
limit (radians for revolute joints,
meters for prismatic joints). Omit if
joint is continuous.

upper (optional, defaults to 0)

An attribute specifying the upper joint
limit (radians for revolute joints,
meters for prismatic joints). Omit if
joint is continuous.

Thanks. In the model I am working with right now a JointVelocityController (http://wiki.ros.org/robot_mechanism_controllers/JointVelocityController) is used. The type of the joint is 'continuous'.

Is the joint in the robot prismatic or revolute?
Comment by florian on 2022-05-20:
It's of type continuous.
Comment by ljaniec on 2022-05-20:
What does it mean? Linear motion? Or rotational?
Comment by florian on 2022-05-20:
According to http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/joint a continuous joint is defined as follows:
a continuous hinge joint that rotates around the axis and has no upper and lower limits
Each wheel of the mobile robot has a joint of the mentioned type. It is used to apply linear velocity (in terms of revolutions per second).

Thank you for the clarification. It will be rad/s then

Thanks! =)

I marked the answer as correct. This is what you mean, right? ... Sorry, I am a bit of a newbie in this forum.
