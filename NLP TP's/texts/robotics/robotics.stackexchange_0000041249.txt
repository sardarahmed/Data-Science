What OS are you using? Do other ROS stacks install fine?
Comment by Eric Perko on 2012-06-10:
According to the status page ( http://www.ros.org/debbuild/electric.html ), the brown drivers stack is building fine and should be available.

I am using Ubuntu Precise..... I cannot install other ros stacks either

A:

Ubuntu Precise does not support ROS Electric (see REP 3)
You should first follow the general instructions for installing ROS Fuerte before installing brown drivers. The brown drivers stack should be available on Fuerte (see fuerte debbuild status).
