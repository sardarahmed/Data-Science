Q:

How much torque do I need for a CNC machine?

I have a handful of 31.2oz-in stepper motors (Mouser.com - Applied Motion: HT17-268D), and I was curious if they would be big enough to run a 3D printing/cutting/etching type (think RepRap) of machine. I had in mind to attach them via  a simple gear to a screw-type drive to run the tool head back and forth. 

Maximum bed size would probably be ~1.5'3. 
Heaviest tool head would be something about half the weight of a Dremel tool.
Hardest substances I would use it on would probably be hardwoods (with high speed cutter) and copper (for PCB etching).

How do I figure the amount of torque needed to drive the head, and would the motors that I already have be big enough to do the job?

A:

I was hoping that someone else would answer this question with some sort of formula or rule of thumb that would apply to a much wider range of materials / cutting speeds / etc.
According to the RepRap website,
"It is recommended that you get approximately 13.7 N-cm (= 0.137 N-m or 1400 gf-cm or 19.4 ozf-in or 1.21 lbf-in) of holding torque (or more) for RepRap axis motors to avoid issues, although one stepper with less has been used successfully.
For Wade's Geared Extruder (most widely used one as of 2012) it is suggested to use motor that is capable of creating a holding torque of at least 40 N-cm."

Since your motors have 31.2oz-in of holding torque -- significantly stronger than that recommendation -- the motors you already have should work fine for the axis motors of a RepRap-like machine.
