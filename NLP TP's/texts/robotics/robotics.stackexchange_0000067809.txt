Q:

Laserscan tf to odom frame (RVIZ)

Hi at all out there,
have a problem with a point that is displayed in RVIZ, but seems not to exist in our data, because all filtering efforts fail.
We do the following steps:

A laserscanner subscriber delivers scan data
We transform the data in our odometry frame with the tf package
We throw away some points that are to far away for our calculation
We apply an algorithm on the remaining data. We tried different algorithms but the problem still remains.

The point lies on the odometry frame origin.

A:

Found the problem. I'm splitting my laserscan into left and right and somehow i had some points in both vectors. Now I checked the vectors against each other for duplicates and erased them - problem solved.
