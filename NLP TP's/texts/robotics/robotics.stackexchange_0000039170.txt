Q:

Simulating smoke in Gazebo

Hi all,
i want to simulate smoke in the gazebo. preliminary solution what i think of is i draw some very small particles in environment and simulate them in a way that smoke behaves.
what i want to know that is it possible in Gazebo to achieve that and secondly if yes then how come. Technical details or tutorial will be appreciated.
(p.s i am new to the ROS and gazebo plateform so keep things less complicated)
Regards

For what purpose do you want to simulate the smoke? Is it just for visualization purposes or is it supposed to trigger a simulated smoke sensors? Not that I think I can help you very much, I am just curious!

There has been work simulating and tracking scent plumes in player/stage - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5652518&tag=1

@Goncalo
it is just for visualization purpose only.

@Zee-Q Ok! Cause I developed plumesim for ROS but it only displays the plume in rviz, and it is a 2D simulator for odor plumes, not for smoke. I'd love to upgrade it for 3D and maybe add some visualization for Gazebo if I get some time to learn how to use it!!!

Gazebo uses Ogre3D for visualization, so you can take a look at the rendering classes http://kforge.ros.org/gazebo/hg/file/955ea031a5b2/src/rendering if you want to try and implement something for visualizing smoke.    @goncalo-cabrita can you point us to your plumesim? seems interesting, thanks.

@hsu Sure, http://ros.org/wiki/simulator_plumesim I'm actually cooking plumesim 2.0 I'll take a look at the rendering classes to see if I can add some Gazebo features for the new version!

A:

Maybe you can try Morse simulator with blender.
Here is the video of Introduction to Smoke Simulation.

but can i later on integrate it to my gazebo environment ?

As I know,the answer is no. I'm still going to find a way to combine them together.
