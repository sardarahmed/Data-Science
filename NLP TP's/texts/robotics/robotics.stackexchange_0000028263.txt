Q:

how to control the mobile robot (two wheels) moving?

In this tutorial http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_robot&cat=build_robot
In step 10. Under the Force/Velocity tab, increase the force/velocity applied to each joint. The robot should move around.
Question: How to set the different velocity for each wheel using C++ plugin. This means I can control the mobile robot to move using C++ code plugin, not set the velocity in the GUI of Gazebo by manually.
Thank you very much!
