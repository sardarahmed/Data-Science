Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: 3DM-GX3-25 IMU

It's a little unclear whether the imu_drivers stack supports the newer IMUs. In the summary, it claims to support both 3DM-GX2 and 3DM-GX3 protocols. However, further down it only speaks about the 3DM-GX2 protocol.
Are the newer devices supported?

A:

Yes, 3DM-GX3 protocol is also supported (see this question). I am using the microstrain_3dmgx2_imu package with Microstrain 3DM-GX3-25 IMU without any issues.
