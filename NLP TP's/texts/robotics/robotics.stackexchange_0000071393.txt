Q:

Errors in neato.launch file?

Hi! I'm trying to map with xv-11 in rviz. When I type $ roslaunch hector_slam_launch neato.launch; I have this:"lookupTransform base_link to neato_laser timed out. Could not transform laser scan into base_frame". Are there errors in my launchfile? Thanks.
node pkg="xv_11_laser_driver" type="neato_laser_publisher" name="xv_11_node"
param name="port" value="/dev/ttyUSB0"
param name="firmware_version" value="2"
param name="frame_id" value="laser"
param name="pub_map_odom_transform" value="true"
param name="map_frame" value="map"
param name="base_frame" value="base_frame"
param name="odom_frame" value="base_frame"

Looks like ROS can't calculate transformation from base_link to the laser. Could you provide full launch file? Do you launch tf node?

This is the launch file

How I launch tf node?

I try to type "$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher" but I have this answer "static_transform_publisher exited due to not having the right number of arguments"; what is it? Thanks!
