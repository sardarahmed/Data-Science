Q:

ls: cannot access /dev/ttyACM0: No such file or directory

Hi,
I have installed the Hokuyo UTM-30LX driver as followed by http://www.isep.ipp.pt/roswiki/hokuyo_node%282f%29Tutorials%282f%29UsingTheHokuyoNode.html.
And then I typed $ls -l /dev/ttyACM0 in the terminal, but it displayed that  ls: cannot access /dev/ttyACM0: No such file or directory.
Why? Any help is appreciated!!!

A:

There is no device. Is it plugged in and powered up properly?
The device might also be any like /dev/ttyACM*.
Are there any error messages when you type dmesg?
To check what is relevant, unplug the device, dmesg, replug it, dmesg, and see what changes. There should be either some messages reported the new device (also giving the device) or error messages.
