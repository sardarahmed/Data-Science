Q:

Does ros::Duration::sleep spin?

If I do ros::Duration::sleep does ros spin and are callback functions called?
If not is there a way to pause the program while still managing callbacks?

A:

No. Sleep just sleeps the thread for the specified duration.

If not is there a way to pause the program while still managing callbacks?

You can have a loop that alternates sleeping and spinning, as exemplified in this roscpp tutorial, or you can have separate spinner threads. I recommend reading the ROS wiki page on callbacks and spinning.

If your question is answered, could you post, for the record, which approached you ended up using?.

So if I have an image callback and a service callback and do sleep in the service callback, will the image callback be blocked too?

@Mehdi: With the standard single-threaded ros::spin: yes
