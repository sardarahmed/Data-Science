Q:

Moveit Gazebo Integration for trajectory execution of panda robot

Hello,
I want to view the trajectory generated by moveit in gazebo.
I have done motion planning using moveit c++ interface and i'm observing the robot movement in Rviz.
The code moveit c++ interface is here.
Here are the controllersfrom gazebo side
Here are the controllers from moveit side
controller manager file is here
My questions are as follows[answered below]:-

What kind of controllers are necessary to observe the trajectory generated by moveit in gazebo?  Can anybody give some example??

I know that moveit c++ interface communicates with Rviz by using some ROS topics/ Actions?
How can i find over which topic/action moveit c++ interface communicates with rviz so that i can use it same ROS topic/action to communicate with Gazebo.

Updated questions:

When i launch moveit_planning_execution file i get the error saying Action client not connected: /joint_trajectory_action

Below is the snapshot of the error
can anybody help in this??
Any kind of help is appreciated.

A:

I have been working through this recently.  I am not working with the panda robot, so I can't point you to code for the panda. However, I have been using the ABB 120 repository as an example.  There are a lot of layers to work through, but all the information is there.
To do my best to answer your questions directly:

You will likely need the joint_state_controller/JointStateController and the position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController, see the above ABB repo for examples.

As a starting point, you don't really need to be aware of specific topics, you can use the MoveGroupInterface (which I see you are using in your code).

@ryan.delgizzi: I have adapted my files as per the reference. Gazebo and controllers are getting launched correctly but when i launch moveit i get error saying "Action client not connected:joint_trajectory_action"
i have not got any cluw how to solve this can you offer some help?

The /joint_trajectory_action is how the move_group communicates with gazebo.  I believe that gets launched from whatever you analogous file is to this one
