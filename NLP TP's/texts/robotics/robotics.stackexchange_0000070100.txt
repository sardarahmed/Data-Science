Q:

build and run only one rostest

I have
add_rostest_gtest(TestClassA test/ClassA.test src/test/TestClassA.cpp)
add_rostest_gtest(TestClassB test/ClassB.test src/test/TestClassB.cpp)

and I want to build and execute just TestClassB and nothing else. I already know how to limit this to only that package:
catkin run_tests --no-deps my_package

But this still builds all the unit tests in my_package. Also every other time I get:
IOError: cannot create test results directory [/home/.../my_package]. Please check permissions.

So is there a way to build the tests but not to run them, and is there a way to build just one test?

A:

The answer to this question tells how to do it using catkin_make:

http://answers.ros.org/question/54051/how-do-i-run-unit-tests-for-a-catkin-package/

In summary, the necessary targets are: tests, run_tests and run_tests_PACKAGENAME.
catkin_tools can probably build and run those same targets, but I am not sure of the exact syntax.
UPDATE: To get the exact target names for package foo:
cd build/foo
make run_tests<TAB><TAB>

True, so catkin tests just builds the tests and catkin tests PACKAGENAME builds just that package. Still it builds all the tests in that package and I don't know how to figure out the specific test target names. What I do now: I just commt out the other tests in CMakeLists.txt. works for me.
