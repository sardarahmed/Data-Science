Q:

Why have EKF and PF slam algorithms been abandoned?

As far as I know all current 3d SLAM systems use pose graph optimization, both local and global. EKF and particle filter algorithms are not used or referenced at all as far as I can tell and the estimate of feature locations is deterministic at the output, not probabilistic.
Why is this? Is it purely because of computational constraints or is there another reason?

A:

Particle filters while not abandoned have become quite rare. Nowadays they are really only used to solve localization problems. The reason being that they are quite expensive (each particle essentially stores the entire state) so 50 particles would be 50 times as expensive as an EKF. Also its other two benefits

Being able to handle non gaussian noise distributions
Handling multi modal distributions

Just don't end up being so important in practice. At least not worth the additional computation cost.
EKF's ,however, nowadays are still used a bunch. Typically they are paired together with a pose graph optimization algorithm. Where the EKF part estimates the current pose(and usually some sort of sliding window of past poses), and those then get fed into backend of all past poses(this is almost always solved with factor graph/optimization based approaches).
An example of this is approach is OpenVINS when paired with ov_secondary.
You still have some papers that solve the whole SLAM problem local and global in one EKF framework such as https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08636.pdf.
