Hi salma,
Don't worry about it, the kinect still works with this error message. It is caused (I believe after working more than 2 month with the kinect) that it is due to the depth registration. But you have nothing to worry about, everything works fine evenif you have this error message.
By the way, when you post a message, you should always specify :

what version of ROS you are using
what Ubuntu you are running it on

Bests regards,
