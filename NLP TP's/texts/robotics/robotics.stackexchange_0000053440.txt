Q:

Autocompletion doesn't work via ssh

Hello!
For some reasons when I use ssh connection autocompletion with ros-commands doesn't work. On the original computer tab completion works, but when I connect to it via ssh I cannot use tab completion :(
I have "source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash" in my .bashrc
I get the following error, after writing roscd [+tab]

roscd terminate called after throwing
an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
what():
locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name
not valid terminate called after
throwing an instance of
'std::runtime_error' what():
locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name
not valid

Anyone had the same problem?
