Q:

Syncing time between two machines

Hello,
I have two machines, one is a master(running roscore) and the second is a slave.
Until now I set manually the time for each computer. Now, I want to do set it automatically.
I searched a lot of options in the internet but I couldn't configure well the configurations.
I tried chrony,ntp,ntpdate and nothing happened. I think that our ISP is blocking the access for these ntp servers.
I also tried to get the time from the ntp server of our ISP but I think that I don't understand very well this subject.
I want to know if there is a simple tutorial how I can take the ros time from the master to be on the slave machine. I prefer to not use a ntp server. I believe that there is a simple way to do that.
I will happy if someone can give me a link or instructions for that problem.

that's exactly what chrony does can do.

So, I tried again with chrony and I found a simple explanation how to do that. Now it works.
If someone want the link for that is here:
