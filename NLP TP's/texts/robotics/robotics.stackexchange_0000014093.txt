Q:

Getting started with motion planning

I have recently finished the coursera Motion Planning course and I am looking for a project to do, using ROS, OpenRave, Gazebo and similar tools. My project would be in the area of motion planning for a mobile robot. The objective is to take a turtlebot from point A to point B in an environment with dynamic obstacles. 
I am looking for suggestions regarding the software architecture and how to connect the above mentioned tools together.

A:

If you're interested in doing generic motion planning the best place to start is with the MoveIt Project
If you specifically want to do ground navigation, the ROS navigation stack has been a standard starting point. However if you're getting started now I'd recommend getting involved with nav2 which is an iteration on the design which is being developed for ROS 2.
