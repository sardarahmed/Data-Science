Q:

Get feedback from custom rqt gui interaction made with C++

Hello,
I am trying to make a GUI for a project.
The idea behind this is, that there are a view buttons and multiple text inputs.
Dependent on what button the user pressed, an action will be taken, with the text input values.
I use the rqt software frame and C++ program language to make a plugin.
My system is a ubuntu 16.04LTS with ROS kinetic.
I followed the tutorial steps from http://wiki.ros.org/rqt/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20C%2B%2B%20Plugin and the plugin is show-able in the rqt menu.
I can open it wen roscore is active, with rqt command in the terminal.
The problem i got is, i don't know how to get a reaction from the buttons.
I tried to make a function with the name on_ButtonA_clicked() (same type of function used in Qt program), but nothing happened.
I looked  at the examples linked in the rqt tutorials wiki page, but i that does not give me a clear solution.
Does anyone know how to make a function that reaction of a button press from the GUI or something comparable?

A:

Found my problem
I did not use connect, signal and slot command.
To connect a button interaction with C++ a connection signal and slot command is required.
Something like connect(ui_.button, SIGNAL(clicked()), this, SLOT(Load_object()));.
The connection part connect the button with the action, signal set the type of trigger (this example it is a action wen clicked) and slot select the function, that will be activated.
