Q:

Difference between car-like and skid-steer robot?

Hi,
I am using the base_local_planner package with the holonomic flag set to false.
However, I want to know if there will be any difference in performance between a car like robot and a skid steer robot? If yes, then what care do we need to take to switch between the two.
Thank you.

A:

Ackermann (car-like) robots pose very different navigation challenges from a traditional diff drive or holonomic robot.
The Ackermann SIG is a very loose collection of ROS users working with ackermann-type robots.
