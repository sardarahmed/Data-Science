Q:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:

When I run the command from this tutorial
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y

I get
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:

I am installing this on an Ubuntu server running 12.04, and when I try to manually install the packages one by one:
sudo apt-get install liburdfdom-headers-dev

I get

Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Package liburdfdom-headers-dev is not
available, but is referred to by
another package.   This may mean that
the package is missing, has been
obsoleted, or   is only available from
another source
E: Package 'liburdfdom-headers-dev'
has no installation candidate

I tried installing not using the source but got equally frustrating errors there.

The problem with OpenCV is that we packaged our own version of OpenCV on Precise, but after Precise we get it from apt-get. So Jade (which came after Precise) try's to get it from apt-get, but it's not there.

I had a similar problem when running rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y on Mint 18.3, then I executed rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -y --os=ubuntu:xenial and worked for me.

I found this tip --os=ubuntu:xenial here: https://gitter.im/mavlink/mavros/archives/2015/02/17

A:

This will probably not be the answer you're looking for, but Jade is not officially supported on Ubuntu Precise. Unresolvable dependencies are exactly the kind of issue you run into then. From the page you linked:

ROS Jade supports Trusty, Utopic, and Vivid. Other platforms are possible to use but are not expected to work out of the box.

REP-003 confirms this: "Support for: Ubuntu Trusty (14.04), Ubuntu Utopic (14.10), Ubuntu Vivid (15.04)".
The packages.ubuntu.com page for liburdfdom-headers-dev shows that it is only available for Trusty and up, hence the error you encountered trying to install it using apt-get.

Edit: alternatives to attempting a full from-source install could be using a chroot (see wiki/InstallingIndigoInChroot) or using docker with ROS.
