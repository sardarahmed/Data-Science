Q:

Can we update the package.xml from a python script?

Is there a way to update a package.xml from a python script? I know that you can catkin_pkg to parse a package.xml and retrieve it's contents as a catkin_pkg.Package. I'm wondering if there's a method to go the opposite way - if I have a catkin_pkg.Package and I want to create a new package.xml. Better still update the existing one with my changes from the script.

A:

A package manifest is just an xml file, so any Python xml parsing library that is able to serialise back to XML should work.
I'm not aware of any support for writing our package.xml files in catkin_pkg or any of the other libraries.
