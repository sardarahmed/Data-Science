Q:

How to add gripper to robot arm and plan according to the end effector on Moveit

Hello! I am simulating for a university project, the Elfin 5 robot arm which package can be found here along with a gripper which package is found here.
Being new to Moveit, I am finding trouble to attach the gripper to the robot to be able to control it and plan accordingly.
Looking at the robot's URDF, there's a part that mentions "elfin_dummy_gripper", I am assuming this the part I should edit? Any help is appreciated.
Thanks!

Hello @reuge,

Being new to Moveit, I am finding trouble to attach the gripper to the robot to be able to control it and plan accordingly.

What I would suggest is to first create xacro /urdf and join the gripper init. Have a look at urdf tutorials  Have a look at the tutorials for creating and joining the link.

Yes, You are true you need to create and join the link with the end-effector.
