Q:

visualize omics?

Hi,
I was reading in commonsense knowledge here ' http://ias.in.tum.de/kb/wiki/index.php/Commonsense_reasoning_about_object_locations '
but I want to visualize parts of the output
so I run first rosrun rosprolog rosprolog mod_vis and open knowrob_omics from inside by register_ros_package(knowrob_omics). and then open visualization convas to start querying and visualizations of what geten out but it not success, so I want to know

that is all after launch mod_vis

((1))Is there help to learn how to makeup this query ?!
?- probability_given(knowrob:'OmicsLocations', Obj, knowrob:'Kitchen', Pr).

((2)) How to visualize the knowrob_omics ?!
((3)) How to start doing commonsense about my own environment and objects ?!
Thanks

What would you like to visualize? You get object classes back, if you would like to visualize object positions, you need to find the corresponding instances.

@moritz see update please

A:

There are several issues:

The inference returns object classes ("citrus fruits can usually be found in kitchens"), the visualization needs concrete object instances that have a position ("THAT lemon in THIS kitchen"). You can't visualize "a citrus fruit".

ERROR: Undefined procedure: add_object/3
ERROR:     However, there are definitions for:
ERROR:         mod_vis:add_object/2

means that there is no predicate add_object that accepts three arguments, only one that accepts two. Like most other programming languages, Prolog doesn't allow you to just add arguments to a predicate call (what is it supposed do with them?)

ERROR: Undefined procedure: display_informations_for/3
ERROR:     However, there are definitions for:
ERROR:         mod_vis:display_information_for/2

is an obvious typo. Please do at least read the error messages before asking.
