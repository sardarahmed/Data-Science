i have the following output
Reading package lists... Done

Reading state information... Done

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming.

same problem here. Did you manage to solve it?

A:

I had a similar problem and I managed to solve it by correctly installing restricted, universe, and multiverse repositories as it is described in link.
My problem was that the packages seemed to be installed however, they were not able to find some of their packages. I solved that problem by changing the Download From to Main Server in Ubuntu's software and update.
I also explained my solution here: link
