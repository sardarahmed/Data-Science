Q:

kinect raw data

I am using ubuntu 11.10 and openni.
My question is how to convert the raw depth data to XYZ point?
(x,y,d) coordinate of (pixel, pixel, mm)
I want to know how to convert it to (mm, mm, mm)

Are you using the openni_camera stack? What launch file are you using to start the Kinect (e.g. openni_launch openni.launch)?

I am using openni_launch openni.launch to start  the kinect.

Can you also teach me the changing fomula??

A:

Hi rosmaker,
If you are using
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch

then the conversion is already being done for you.
You only need to subscribe to the topic /camera/depth_registered/points. This topic is of type sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 and represents the 3D point cloud of the scene in meters.
You can find further information on how to access point cloud data in http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl/Tutorials
I hope this helps

What is the way to use the scene in [mm]? If I am using other launch file or not, does I use other way?
Comment by Martin Peris on 2012-07-05:
Well, if you want your coordinates in mm, one thing you can do is multiply by 1000 all the values in /camera/depth_registered/points

openni have convertprojectivetorealworld function in windows openni. Is this same the topic /camera/depth_registered/points?

And does raw depth data send by the kinect on 11bit ? how about changed xyz data?
Comment by Pototo on 2016-06-21:
how do I do the opposite? How do I convert the pixels around point (0.1 meters, 0.52 meters to pixel (x, y) position? I am using the old Kinect (640 x 480 resulution kinect)
