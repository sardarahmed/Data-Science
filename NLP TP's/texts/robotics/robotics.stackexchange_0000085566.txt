Q:

what is header.seq, header.stamp header.frame_id for mavros topics

I am not able to understand the following error (specially first three arguments of the header) with msg type Type: geometry_msgs/PoseStamped. It would be good if I get example for this command
rostopic pub -r 1 /mavros/setpoint_position/local  geometry_msgs/PoseStamped geometry_msgs/Pose '[0.0,0.0,3.0]' '[0.0,0.0,0.0]'
    ERROR: Too many arguments:
     * Given: ['geometry_msgs/Pose', [0.0, 0.0, 3.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]
     * Expected: ['header', 'pose']

Args are: [header.seq header.stamp header.frame_id pose.position.x pose.position.y pose.position.z pose.orientation.x pose.orientation.y pose.orientation.z pose.orientation.w]

Here is datatype of msg
rosmsg show geometry_msgs/PoseStamped
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Pose pose
  geometry_msgs/Point position
    float64 x
    float64 y
    float64 z
  geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
    float64 x
    float64 y
    float64 z
    float64 w

A:

The general command should look like this pub <topic-name> <topic-type> [data...].
So the geometry_msgs/Pose [...] part is wrong in your example.
If you hit tab after geometry_msgs/PoseStamped it will create you the required data fields and you can fill them out. Not that  the orientation in a pose is actually a quaternion and thus requires for values.
rostopic pub -r 1 /mavros/setpoint_position/local  geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: ''
pose:
  position:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
  orientation:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
    w: 0.0"

what are the variables associated with header seq, secs, nsecs and frame_id?
Comment by mgruhler on 2018-02-28:
what do you mean with "what are the variables"? The header is a standard ROS msg (http://docs.ros.org/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Header.html).
