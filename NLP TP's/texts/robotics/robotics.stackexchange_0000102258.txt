Q:

Easiest way for closed kinematic chain?

Greetings.
I have a model containing a closed kinematic chain, which is not supported by ROS URDF file standard. Therefore I could write the description also in SDF which allows closed kinematic chains, however, I am not certain if I could use something like XACRO to parametrize the SDF similar to an URDF.
Alternatively, is it possible to use the <gazebo> tag in the context of the URDF for the definition of the joints which close the kinematic chain?
TL;DR

I have a closed kinematic chain
within a robot configuration.
Is it possible to parametrize the
SDF which allows for the closed
kinematic chain?
Is it possible the achieve the closed
kinematic chain with the use of the
<gazebo> tag within the URDF?
Is there a fast, straight forward way
to get a parametrizable robot
description for closed kinematic
chains?

A:

Yes, you could use xacro to parse a parameterized SDF file directly if you want, either using extensions of the base xacro tool (e.g. https://github.com/gezp/xacro4sdf) or with a little copy paste (or scripting) of the generated output
Yes, you can use Xacro with <gazebo> tags to create closed kinematic chains that would function in gazebo when the generated URDF gets converted to SDF. This might be a useful example: https://github.com/2b-t/closed_loop/blob/humble/urdf/closed_loop.urdf.xacro
Fast and straightforward is a bit arbitrary... depends a bit on your needs and what you're starting with. I'd recommend using the "standard" xacro->urdf->sdf pipeline so your description file remains compatible with other tools like RViz without requiring duplicate definitions. Adding the gazebo tags isn't too cumbersome.

Thank you very much! As you, I prefer the approach with <gazebo> tags, so I have only one file to maintain.
