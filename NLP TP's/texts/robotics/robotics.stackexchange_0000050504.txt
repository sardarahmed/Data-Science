I just checked, and in Ubuntu 11.10 (amd64), the package is there. Which version of Ubuntu are you using?

Hi, I am using ubuntu oneiric (11.10)

A:

The package is definitely there. Make sure that you have a file called /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list with the following line in it:
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu oneiric main

Then do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ros-electric-pr2-apps, and you should be all set. Also see the Installation instructions.
Update: George sent me an email with some screenshots. Your network connection isn't working properly, as you can see from the errors (unable to resolve host address packages.ros.org etc.). Once you've fixed that, it should work.

Dear Martin, I am not sure i understood what i should sent you. Which network connection command  should i run and sent you the output?
Comment by Martin Günther on 2013-04-25:
Dear George, this is a general Ubuntu networking question, not a ROS question. Try googling "unable to resolve host address", or ask on the general Ubuntu help forums, you'll probably get a better answer there.

OK! I will. Thanks!
