Q:

How can I make a motion tracking camera?

I'm looking into CCTV, and am interested in minimising costs by having a motion tracking camera cover an area that would otherwise utilise multiple cameras.
There is already something like this on the market manufactured by a company called NightWatcher (I think).  However, it does not track, it merely senses using 3 PIR's and points the camera in 1 of 3 positions. Ping ponging between them if the subject is between sensors.
I like the idea of this, but not the drawbacks, and was wondering if there was anything I could do with an arduino or similar to achieve a better result.
I stumbled across this, but am not entirely sure about it. Also this is for outside application, and that thread is for indoor (if that makes a difference).

Edit...
Just in case I have mislead you, I want to have a unit where sensors detect movement and then a camera to face that position.

A:

You can do all this with the right software, no sensors required (or the sensors could be other cameras).
The technique you're looking for is known as Frame Differencing - it basically means taking a frame of camera footage and using it as a masking filter on the next frame, this reveals the pixels which have changed in the current frame, these are usually pixels representing observed objects which have moved.
This gives you motion detection and can be done with fairly low resolution 'sensor' cameras, which then tell your main high resolution camera which way to face.
The 'ping-pong' effect would be mitigated by always having the motion target in the center of the main camera's view and only using the interpreted data from the sensor cameras to calculate the object's position.
