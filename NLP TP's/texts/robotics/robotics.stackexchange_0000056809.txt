Q:

Unable to subscribe to [ros-users] mailinglist

i am trying to subscribe to the ros users mailing list, i did confirm the subscription, and i got a confirmation/welcome mail, but I don't get any messages.  Do you know, what I can do, to get it work? I already checked my mail-space, spam-directory and so on.

Have you considered that there maybe just weren't any messages since you subscribed?

A:

I think you may have signed up for the old version of the mailing list. Make sure you are signed up for the new version of the list hosted on lists.ros.org. http://lists.ros.org/mailman/listinfo
We have migrated away from the hosting on code.ros.org, however the list is still available for archival purposes. I have added some more warnings on the subscription page and welcome email.
