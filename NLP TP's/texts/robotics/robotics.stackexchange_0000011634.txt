Q:

Why ODE for optimal control theory?

I am trying to understand optimal control theory which forms the base for reinforcement learning techniques in AI. Whenever I open a lecture or a book or any online notes, everything starts with an ODE and then derivation goes the payoff function which is straight forward.
I am trying hard to comprehend why an ODE models any system? Many say it easy to begin with but why this model?
$dx/dt = f(x(t))$
I could not find the reason and decided to ask for help.

A:

The reason why ODE's are used is simply: physics. It would be great if any system could be modelled by a simple linear function like $x(t)=at$, but nature is not so simple, or linear. Even when you neglect nature, dynamical systems, like $\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t))$ still pop up everywhere, like CroCo said, it is the basis of the mathematical modelling of many systems.
I would suggest looking into differential equations first before starting with reinforcement learning.
