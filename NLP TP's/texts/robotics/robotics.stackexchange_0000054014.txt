Q:

rqt_nav_view get a float division error

I was just click on set pose and set goal and got this error.
How is this panel used? Set goal and set pose work on the rviz main panel.
viki:~$ rosrun rqt_nav_view rqt_nav_view 
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_nav_view/nav_view.py", line 354, in draw_position
    u = (v[0]/mag, v[1]/mag)

I saw ticket so I closed it. Now I can see it was only for documentation enhancement. I will test it again and reopen if it has not been fixed by any recent upgrade.
