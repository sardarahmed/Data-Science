Q:

Save PointCloud2 data

I am running Hokuyo UTM-30LX in real time and getting PointCloud2 published. Each time I move the laser, the previous PointCloud data is lost. How can I save parts of pcl assembled scan?

A:

Have a look at the laser assembler package. That one will allow you to create aggregated pointclouds from multiple laser scans and retrieve them via a service. By calling this service from your own node, you could collect pointcloud data over time, save it to .pcd files or do anything else you want.
