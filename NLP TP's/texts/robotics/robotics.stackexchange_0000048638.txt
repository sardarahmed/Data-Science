Q:

Connect a wiimote

I am trying to get a wiimote connected to my computer. For this I am using the wiimote package (ros.org/wiki/wiimote).
Here is what I did:

install package: sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-wiimote

install dependencies: rosdep install wiimote

make: rosmake wiimote

run wiimote_node.py: The first problem is here. The wiimote_node.py script does not exist in the wiimote package. According to this tutorial (ros.org/wiki/wiimote/Tutorials/StartingWiimoteNode) you need to execute rosrun wiimote wiimote_node.py. This doesn't work. I found out that the script was installed in /opt/ros/groovy/lib/wiimote/. So I executed it there: python /opt/ros/groovy/lib/wiimote/wiimote_node.py

Executing the wiimote_node.py script results in following error:
python wiimote_node.py  Traceback (most recent call last): File "wiimote_node.py", line 87, in <module> from wiimote.msg import IrSourceInfo ImportError: No module named wiimote.msg
Can anybody help me with this problem?
I tried the whole day to figure out whats wrong there. But i cant get it to work.

I think this is a bug in the catkin build / installation, I created a ticket here and I'll look into it. Thanks!

Fix has been committed and will appear in ros-groovy-wiimote 1.9.9

A:

Solved the problem by downloading/building/installing the source:

Download source from github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers

unzip wiimote folder into /opt/ros/groovy/share/wiimote

build and install:

cd /opt/ros/groovy/share/wiimote
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make install

start wiimote node: rosrun wiimote wiimote_node.py
