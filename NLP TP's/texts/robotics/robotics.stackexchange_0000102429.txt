path smoother on Galactic branch

I noticed that the path smoother module is only supported by humble version. Is there a way to add this module to galactic branch?
Regards.

Galactic is EOL in roughly 30 days, it is not our intent to continue to update that branch further beyond critical bug fixes.

Sorry! I'd rather be honest about what's happening than pretend like I'm able to manage support for that many distributions at once.
