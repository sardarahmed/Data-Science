Q:

Effects of manually editing gmapping maps?

I have a map of my house generated by gmapping and now I am using it with amcl for navigation.  Does it make sense to clean up the map in an image editor?  For example, if you have a hallway wall that is slightly jagged in the original map, does it make sense to replace the original pixels with a perfectly straight line?  I'm just wondering if this would help or hinder amcl for subsequent navigation.
Thanks!

A:

Cleaning up the map as you're suggesting shouldn't hurt localization performance, but probably won't help either.  By default, amcl uses a likelihood field model when interpreting laser data; this model has the effect of "blurring" the obstacles in the map, so moving a pixel a bit one way or the other won't have a huge effect.
If you compare performance with both maps, I'd be interested to know the results.

Thanks Brian!  I'm about to run some amcl endurance tests with the TurtleBot.  If I get time to run them with different versions of the map, I'll post back the results.

Can i draw a complete map(.pgm file) on my own and feed that to Robot for navigation? if so how can this be accomplished?

@Kishore Kumar - Did you find a way? Even though that should be highly unlikely since the map was constructed without odometry and it will hard to make the map interactive on RVIZ.
