Have you set up your Ubuntu repositories as described here? Then the package should be found.

Thank you very much sir...now i have knowrob installed ^_^

A:

Just install it from debian packages:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-knowrob

This command installs the complete stack and all its dependencies. A call to rosdep is then not required anymore.
