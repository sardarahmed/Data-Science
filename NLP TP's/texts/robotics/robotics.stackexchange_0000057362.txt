Same problem here in the Netherlands, while status.ros.org is saying everything is fine. http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/wiki.ros.org

Same problem (Germany) (http://wiki.ros.org works, but any link => 503)

A:

Yesterday our hosting partner has added a frontend cache to the ros.org webserver in order to reduce the load on the machine as well as improve the overall response time.
Obviously that is generating random problems from either all pages being unavailable for certain user to only some pages are not working. Our hosting partner is working on the issue. Please see http://status.ros.org for any progress.
A list of current mirrors to use in the mean time:

The change to the webserver has been rolled back and it should by now work for everyone again.

status.ros.org shows no problems, but wiki.ros.org does not point to the wiki but some apache directory with api docs and other stuff.

It's just a roller coaster over there at OSL today. Sorry, hopefully things will smooth out soon.
