Q:

viso2_ros and robot_pose_ekf

Hey guys,
Is there any way to get the visual odometry from the viso2_ros package to the robot_pose_ekf. From what I have had a look , the robot_pose_ekf requires data on the /vo topic. Is the data coming out of visi2_ros can be published on the /vo and fed into the robot_pose_ekf??

A:

yes, just hook up the viso2_ros/odometry to the robot_pose_ekf/vo since they are both nav_msgs/Odometry messages.
