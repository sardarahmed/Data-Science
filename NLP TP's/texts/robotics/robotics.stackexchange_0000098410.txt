Q:

Using a custom lidar in ROS

Hello, i have a lidar called Litra LTME-02A from China. However, i can not find any package to support this kind. Can you help me to connect this lidar with ROS ? Or are there any packages supporting all kinds of lidar ?
This is the link of this product http://www.litratech.com/article/121/24.html ?
Thanks in advance!

A:

Their are no generic packages for such devices. It entirely depends on the type of interface provided with the sensor (ethernet, serial etc) and the configuration parameters/commands for querying and setting up the sensor.
If you already have a way of talking to the sensor (driver) and getting raw packets into your computer then you can write a ros wrapper around the manufacturer/vendor provided driver.
https://github.com/LitraTech/ltme01_driver.git i found this driver for ltme_01 module. perhaps you could try using this first
