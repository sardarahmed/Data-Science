Q:

rosdoc_lite and missing raw_text support?

If I do
git clone https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdoc_lite.git

I get a file msgenator.py that contains support for raw_text. But the msgenator file in the groovy and hydro debs does not contain that change. So what is wrong here? Is it me that uses the wrong rosdoc_lite?

A:

The fix for this issue (#29) has not been released yet.
A new rosdoc_lite release should be available soon.
