Q:

openni_tracker on OS X

Anyone getting this to work, following the directions at http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_tracker?
I get the following:
Warning: USB events thread - failed to set priority. This might cause loss of data...
Find user generator failed: Can't create any node of the requested type!

This with the unstable branch of perception_pcl on OS X.
Other openni binaries work, like NiViewer.
I have the NI binaries from PrimeSense, but maybe they need to be in a specific location? Or marked in one of my paths?

A:

That suggests to me that you have not installed the NITE binaries and registered the plugin with OpenNI correctly.  How did you install OpenNI and NITE?

Got the binaries, since I can't install from source on OS X. Think I put in the code correctly. How should I have done it?
