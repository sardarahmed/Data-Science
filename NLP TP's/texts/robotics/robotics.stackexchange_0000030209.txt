Q:

Which trac component to use when submitting tickets for object_recognition stack?

I'd like to submit feature requests for packages in stack object_recognition but cannot find any suitable component in https://code.ros.org/trac/wg-ros-pkg. Leaving it unspecified is not exactly what I want. Suggestions?

A:

The component should be the stack name, object_recognition, but it is not currently defined.
Try creating it yourself. If you don't have permission, add that to your question (as a comment) and someone with admin authority can do it for you.

Ticket has already found an owner and component is changed to object_recognition. Thanks.

I've created object_recognition as a component.  If you opened a ticket it should get to the right place eventually.

Yes, it's not defined. I followed your suggestion, opened a ticket and will see what happens and whether it's necessary to find someone taking care of it. Thanks.
