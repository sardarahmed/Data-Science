Q:

How to programmatically reset Gazebo

Students in the class I'm TAing are wondering if there is a way to programmatically reset the Gazebo simulation so they can debug their projects faster. I could benefit from this too :). A couple of them said that they looked through the documentation and couldn't find anything in the Gazebo API.
Is it possible to programmatically reset a Gazebo simulation?
thanks,
