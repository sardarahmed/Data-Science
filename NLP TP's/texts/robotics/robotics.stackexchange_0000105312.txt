Q:

Best Robot for Simulation

Can you guys suggest me a Robot with 6 or 7 degree of Freedom which works well with Ros Humble for my Thesis. It will be only on a simulated environment.

A:

It depends on what you need to do. I assume you want to do path planning.
If you just need a kinematic model, and you want to build your own path planning algorithm for that model, you can choose any URDF robot you can find. Here you have an exhaustive list of URDF robots.
If you need a complete simulated environment to run and compare existing path planning algorithms and view and run trajectories, I would follow MoveIt's documentation for a setup with the Panda robot.
