Q:

Rosserial Arduino Problem

Hi, i just started using ROS and i'm trying to use rosserial_arduino.
I'm trying to get the examples working but I have some problems, when I launch:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

I have this error on the console:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1402855665.112426] Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

I read other threads and i loaded the sketch on a Mega 2650 and a UNO with atmega328 to exclude memory issues but i have always the same error.
Some additional information:
$rospack find rosserial
[rospack] Error: stack/package rosserial not found

$rospack find rosserial_arduino
/opt/ros/hydro/share/rosserial_arduino

$rospack find rosserial_python
/opt/ros/hydro/share/rosserial_python

$rosmsg show Adc
[rosserial_arduino/Adc]:
uint16 adc0
uint16 adc1
uint16 adc2
uint16 adc3
uint16 adc4
uint16 adc5

I'm running Hydro on Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit
Any help would be appreciated

A:

I don't think you're specifying the port parameter to the rosserial_python node properly.
Try specifying the ROS ~port parameter:
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0

Tx for the answer and sorry for the late reply. Actually it was a trivial problem related to the fact i was running ubuntu on a virtual machine and arduino program had some problems handling the serial port itself.

Can you specify the solution, because I have the same problem.

@BigAnt please ask a new question instead of commenting on a 5-year-old question.
