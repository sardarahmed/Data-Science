Q:

Why does DRCSIM Atlas robot model use URDF?

Sorry for the weird typing, but if I put DRCSIM in the title, lots of old message titles suddenly appear and I am not allowed to type this text into the interface.
Why is the DRCSIM model using what I thought was the "old style" modeling language URDF? I translated the robot model into SDF 1.3 to get control of and simplify the code used by the plugins. The only thing that didn't translate was the safety-controller field in the joint descriptions. Is there some undocumented magic that is going on with URDF that doesn't happen with SDF?
Thanks,
Chris

A:

A lot of ROS packages rely on URDF, and we need those ROS packages to control Atlas. Until ROS is updated to use SDF, we have to be in this ugly state of supporting both SDF and URDF.
