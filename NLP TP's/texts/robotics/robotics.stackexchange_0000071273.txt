Q:

Draw a path for a robot to follow

I am trying to get a omni-directional robot to follow a user input path. My first idea was to override the global path planner. After reading about it for a few days I think that it might work but it there is probably a better way. The navigation stack seems to be more from getting from A to B, not "hit all this waypoints". Meaning I would have to put every point(or some interval of the points) into the  makeplan function of the global planner. But this seems ineffective and cause the robot to shake.
It seems like there should be an easier way. As anybody done this before?

A:

Write a plugin for the global planner where you create the global plan the way you want it. You could input it by subscribing to a topic, e.g.
Thus, you would make use of the rest of move_base but have full flexibility.
However, you would need to stick the global planner interface.

hello, assuming you are talking about this tutorial
How would I define a sine/circular paths? or any other paths defined by a mathematical function
