Q:

Different time zones between ros nodes

Browsing the ros::now() code I've seen that it returns the local time, if I'm not mistaken it can cause some issues between computers that are on different time zones.
For instance, a robot might be on UTC, but a developer computer might be on a different time zone, wouldn't ros message timestamps be messed up and cause strange behaviour.
Shouldn't ros::timestamps be in UTC?

Yes, that can cause trouble for many components of Linux or Unix, not just for ROS.

Hehehe, the situation is that the robot system time is UTC in order to store the logs from different robots in differents places with the same time zone. But a developer computer might be in his local time zone, and I was wondering if that could case problems.

Your lab must be very large...

A:

ros::Time::now() returns UTC. If you do a ros::Time::now().toSec(), it's going to give you the number of seconds since the Epoc (aka UTC).

You are right, I missunderstood the code.
