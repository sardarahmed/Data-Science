Q:

Problem with creating ROS in Fuerte

Hi,
I recently installed ROS Fuerte on my laptop ( still have ROS electric on it). When I tery to creat a workspace, I get the following error:
turtlebot@turtlebot03:~$ rosws init ~/fuerte_workspace /opt/ros/fuerte
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/rosws", line 52, in 
import rosinstall.rosws_cli
ImportError: No module named rosws_cli
Does anyone have any idea what might be source of the problem?

Fuerte is already old. Consider updating to a newer distro (aka Hydro) so that you can have more people able to help you. Just a wild guess, is it better after running: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get update python-rosinstall ?

A:

You can try swapping your active distro by calling source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
