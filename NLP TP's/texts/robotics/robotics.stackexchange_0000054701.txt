Q:

--install-space on hydro fails

Installing hydro on osx 10.8.5 isolated just went fine, however when it want to install it to the usual place /opt/ros/hydro
with  ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install --install-space /opt/ros/hydro the following error happens:
Unhandled exception of type 'RuntimeError':
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./src/catkin/bin/../python/catkin/builder.py", line 785, in build_workspace_isolated
    number=index + 1, of=len(ordered_packages)
  File "./src/catkin/bin/../python/catkin/builder.py", line 559, in build_package
    "'\n  This sometimes occurs when a non-catkin package is "
RuntimeError: No env.sh file generated at: '/opt/ros/hydro/env.sh'
  This sometimes occurs when a non-catkin package is interpreted as a catkin package.
  This can also occur when the cmake cache is stale, try --force-cmake.
<== Failed to process package 'catkin': 
  No env.sh file generated at: '/opt/ros/hydro/env.sh'
  This sometimes occurs when a non-catkin package is interpreted as a catkin package.
  This can also occur when the cmake cache is stale, try --force-cmake.
Command failed, exiting.

Any ideas how to solve this?
