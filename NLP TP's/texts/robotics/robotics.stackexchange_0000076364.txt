roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_turtlebot.launch
rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find rbx1_nav`/sim.rviz
rosrun rbx1_nav timed_out_and_back.py

it works good,but the fellow command have some problems:
roslaunch rbx1_nav keyboard_teleop.launch

A:

Do you have turtlebot_teleop package?
Try to run
rospack find turtlebot_teleop

and see whether you have it or not.
If no , then you need to install it first. turtlebot_teleop is a part of turtlebot stack.
For example, if your distro is Indigo. You can follow this link for installation.
Let me quote from the link :
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot ros-indigo-turtlebot-apps ros-indigo-turtlebot-interactions ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator ros-indigo-kobuki-ftdi ros-indigo-rocon-remocon ros-indigo-rocon-qt-library ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar-msgs
