Q:

LMS1xx node is not available now?

Is LMS1xx node still available on link text now? I was told this:"Cannot load information on name: LMS1xx, distro: fuerte, which means that it is not yet in our index. Please see this page for information on how to submit your repository to our index." Does someone has this node copy?

I think this is the node copy you are finding.
