Q:

Determine current roomba state / operating mode

Using the SCI messages, I would like to determine the current operating mode or state of a iRobot Roomba 780. Finally, I would like to detect and separate four states: 

Cleaning
In docking station
Returning to docking station
Error (e.g. trapped on obstacle)

What is a fast and reliable way to detect those states using SCI data?
The Roomba SCI Sensor packets "Remote Control Command" and "Buttons" seem to return the currently called commands and not the currently executed ones.

A:

I found a partial answers to my question:
The "current" sensor message indicates if the roomba is operating (< 0) or in the docking station (> 0).
Open remains error handling and "searching for docking station".
I'll adapt my answers if I get further.
EDIT 2015-05-05:
The solution which seems to work looks in pseudo code as follows:
if ( charging_state == 5 ) {
  return ERROR;
}
else if ( charging_state == 2 ) {
  return CHARGING;
}
else {
  if ( charger_available == 2 ) {
    return INDOCK;
  }
  else {
    if ( main_brush_current != 0 && current < 0 ) {
      return WORKING;
    }
    else {
      return ERROR;
    }
  }
}

The "variables" within the if statements are corresponding sensor messages given in the document, linked by @Andrea.
The "return values" indicate the corresponding Roomba states.
