Q:

No module named setuptools.config

Hello, I tried to follow the instructions to install ROS2 using colcon and I get the following error (even though the build continue and pass):

[0.639s]
ERROR:colcon.colcon_core.entry_point:Exception
loading extension
'colcon_core.package_identification.python':
No module named 'setuptools.config'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File
"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/colcon_core/entry_point.py", line 98, in load_entry_points
extension_type = load_entry_point(entry_point)   File
"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/colcon_core/entry_point.py", line 140, in load_entry_point
return entry_point.load()   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources/init.py",
line 2229, in load
return self.resolve()   File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources/init.py",
line 2235, in resolve
module = import(self.module_name, fromlist=['name'], level=0)   File
"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/colcon_core/package_identification/python.py",
line 10, in 
from setuptools.config import read_configuration ImportError: No
module named 'setuptools.config'

With the following command:
colcon build --symlink-install 

I am running on Ubuntu 16.04 and followed this link https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Linux-Development-Setup
Do I need to specify something to remove this error ?
Thanks

What version of setuptools do you have installed? python3 -m pip freeze --all | grep setuptools

A:

Ah! Yes I guess it was too old as explained in https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/512
My version was setuptools==20.7.0 and after the "sudo -H python3 -m pip install -U setuptools" it is now setuptools==39.2.0. thanks !
