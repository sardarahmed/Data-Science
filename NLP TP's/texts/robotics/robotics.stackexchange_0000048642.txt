Hello,
I am trying to build map using gmapping  and i have already built that map but it seems to be inaccurate because the irobot   in map moves to forward and backward only ,but actually irobot has moved to right and left also and it dosen't appear in map
Can anyone tell me how to draw an accurate map?
thanks in advance
