Q:

Draw on a map with mouse

I'm looking for a user to demonstrate trajectories on a map. I'm using RViz for everything, so an RViz would be excellent but other options are ok too. The map is coming from map_server as nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid I want the user to click and drag to draw on the map, and I want to be able to produce a standard nav_msgs::Path from it. Any ideas how to do this?
Do I have to make my own application from the ground up for this? Or can rviz be hacked to do this?

+1 Here ! , I also want to draw things (like polygons) on the map , to define prohibited area easily without image editors and save it as a new file for global costmap. Any suggestions?

A:

May not be what you need though, use Publish Point tool on RViz (surprisingly I don't find it described anywhere on ROS wiki). It's usually on the top bar of RViz. See this video that shows placing multiple Publish Points in a closed loop draws polygon.

Not entirely sure, but with frontier_exploration package you can specify a region for the robot to explore, and the software computes a path to that location. In the same link I mentioned above is a bit more about the package.
