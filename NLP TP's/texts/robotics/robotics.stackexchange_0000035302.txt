Q:

Gazebo, pioneer model and plugins

I'm porting a pioneerAT gazebo model on urdf model for ros.
What I should do is loading that urdf model on gazebo (ros version) and after move the robot programmatically (I have to test my own path planner).
What is the best way for do that, maybe use plugins?

A:

Here is an introduction to using Gazebo with ROS commands.
Here are some tutorials for using urdf with ROS. You should definitely look at the tutorial for "Building a Movable Robot Model with URDF".
Finally, you could also look at the guardian stack to see how to properly manipulate a four-wheel skid steer robot like the pioneer2AT.
