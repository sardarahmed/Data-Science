Q:

what are the states and transistion matrices used in the robot_pose_ekf stack

Does anyone know what state vector, inputs, transistion matrix and measurement matrix is used with the robot_pose_ekf package?
The package fuses data from odometry, IMU and vo. how does this implement the ekf?I've read that you do a prediction step and then a correction step. During which step is each of the data used?
I'm trying to modify the code to incorporate a gyro, but am unable to understand the code.
Thanks!
