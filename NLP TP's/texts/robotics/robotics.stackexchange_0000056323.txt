Q:

turtlebot calibration no IR scan using Hydro

I can't get the turtlebot to calibrate using the turtlebot_calibration calibrate.launch file.  It just outputs "Still waiting for scan" and I can see that the IR sensor never turns on.  The kinect works fine when I've tried gmapping though so I know it does work.

A:

I would guess it's the same issue discussed here:
http://answers.ros.org/question/112391/nothing-published-to-scan-under-hydro/
Nothing is published to /scan (which is required for calibration) unless depth_registration is set to false.  You might try:
roslaunch turtlebot_calibration calibrate.launch depth_registration:=false
I can't test it directly because I'm using Kobuki-based turtlebots.
