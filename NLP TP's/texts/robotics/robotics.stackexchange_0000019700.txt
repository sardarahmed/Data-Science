Q:

Will a 2.4ghz controller work with a 5.8ghz video transmitter?

Iâ€™m building an fpv racing drone and I accidentally ordered a 2.4ghz controller and a 5.8ghz video transmitter. Will they work together?
I have 5.8ghz fpv goggles so I assume they will work.

A:

I am not sure about the details of your setup, but two devices can communicate to each other only if they use the same frequency band(s) and the same (read: matching) signal encoding.
On the other hand, you can use (as example) 2.4GHz for commands and feedback and 5.8GHz for video transmission.
