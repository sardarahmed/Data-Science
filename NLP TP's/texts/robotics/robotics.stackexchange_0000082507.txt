Q:

Slam to path planning

I wanted to know what way to implement a complete Slam test. I currently have a Omron OS32C laser scanner mounted on a AGV. Please suggest me the approach to create a map from a laser scanner and then making my AGV follow a specific path.
I know that gmapping package can be used to create the map from laser scanner readings. Still I want to know whether there is a full stack implementation someone has carried out and can suggest me.
Thanks

You can take a look at the ROS Navigation Stack which offers several options for global and local planners plus plenty of tutorials for getting up to speed!
