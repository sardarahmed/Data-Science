Q:

roslaunch can't find 'resource' and says file doesn't exist

Working through this tutorial on navigation package: http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup
I built the launch files as directed. The first one launches OK. The second one fails.
Launch file with issue:

<launch>
  <master auto="start"/>

  <!-- Run the map server -->
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find catkin_ws)/map.pgm map_resolution"/>

  <!--- Run AMCL -->
  <include file="$(find amcl)/examples/amcl_diff.launch" />

  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="global_costmap" />
&lt;rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="local_costmap" />
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
&lt;rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_2dnav)/base_local_planner_params.yaml" command="load" />
  </node>
</launch>

The error code:

Traceback (most recent call last):

ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/jade/share
ROS path [5]=/opt/ros/jade/stacks
linux@linux-Latitude-D630:~/catkin_ws/src/my_robot_name_2dnav$

It is referring a folder (catkin_ws) as a resource. I'm not sure what to make of that. The error shows the ROS Package Path and it's definitely there. I have sourced it from opt folder and rebuilt without help.
To see what happens if I get past that error, I deleted the map_server line from the file and ran again and got this error.

The file it says doesn't exist, does exist and the path is correct. So with the succession of errors, it looks like I have a configuration problem, but can't figure out what the issue is.
Any help is appreciated.

If you feel your question has been answered, please indicate that by ticking the checkmark to the left of the answer. That will clearly mark the question as answered in the question list.

A:

 <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find catkin_ws)/map.pgm map_resolution"/> 

the problem is in this line in your launch file: you are asking roslaunch to search for a package called catkin_ws, which it can't find. Hence the ResourceNotFound exception.
You can only ask roslaunch to look for packages, not directories, and if you look at the launch file example given in the tutorial you linked, you'll see that is exactly what they do:
  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find my_map_package)/my_map.pgm my_map_resolution"/>

Notice the $(find my_map_package).

If there was an emoji on the board with a forehead slap, I would use that here. Thank you for taking the time to explain.
Any idea what causes the file-does-not-exist error? Is it possible that the duplicated line causes an issue? It was in the tutorial so I left it in.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-06-09:
? I'm not sure I understand: there is no duplicated line (at least not in the launch file you posted). You seem to have altered the map_server node args, substituting catkin_ws (which is a directory) for my_map_package (an actual pkg). roslaunch can't search for dirs, only pkgs.

GVD,
I was unable to fix the file-does-not-exist rationally, so I deleted and created a new one. That corrected it. Launch file is functioning now. Now I'm on to the next issue of AMCL not recognizing the robot pose.  Thanks again for your help. If you guys weren't here to help, I'd be screwed.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-06-09:
Well, basically you put catkin_ws as an argument to the $(find ..) substitution arg. That will cause roslaunch to go looking for a package called catkin_ws. There is no package called 'catkin_ws'. It is a directory. Pkgs have package.xml files. roslaunch only finds pkgs.
