Q:

cmake error at cmakelists.txt:21 (find_package): by not providing "findcontrol_toolbox.cmake" in cmake_module_path this project has asked cmake to find a package configuration file provided by "control_toolbox", but cmake did not find one. could not find a package configuration file provided by "control_toolbox" with any of the following names:
control_toolboxconfig.cmake
control_toolbox-config.cmake
add the installation prefix of "control_toolbox" to cmake_prefix_path or set "control_toolbox_dir" to a directory containing one of the above files. if "control_toolbox" provides a separate development package or sdk, be sure it has been installed.

A:

CMake can't find control_toolbox.
Have you installed control_toolbox (sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-control-toolbox) or is control_toolbox cloned in the source workspace that you are trying to build?
