Q:

How to modify and build a rosbuild package from source in ros groovy?

I am trying to modify and build the rosfalcon package. I am using ubuntu 12.04 and groovy.
How do I set up a workspace from an existing package in groovy? There seems to be tons of examples about creating a workspace from scratch, but I couldn't locate any about setting up your environment to modify an already existing package. Everything I tried ended up with either ROS not being able to find that package, or the package not building.
So, if I have the sources for a package I want to modify, where do I place them and which commands should I use to tell ROS it exists/build it/install it?

A:

I haven't done this for rosfalcon (and can't find any information about it on the wiki), but this has worked for me:
cd $catkin_ws/src
git clone http://<blah blah blah>
cd $catkin_ws
catkin_make
roscd <package>

Where $catkin_ws is an already existing catkin workspace, whose setup.bash file I've already sourced. I'd guess that you either missed the catkin_make or sourcing the workspace's setup file.
Edit:
Thanks for the link! After downloading the code via:
bzr branchÂ http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cyphylab/cyphy/bonsai

It became clear that the problem is this isn't a catkin-ized package. Check this out for information about using the old-style rosbuild system with catkin. In short, make sure you have the bonsai directory somewhere in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, after which you should be able to
rosmake cyphy_rosfalcon

Unfortunately, this gives errors on my system (I'm using OSX), but this should at least solve your build problems.

Thanks for answering! The rosfalcon package is developped by Queensland UTech, and is located in their bazaar repo, which you can find at tinyurl mvpne3a. I did source the setup file and use catkin_make. It looks like catkin_make doesn't see the package. Anything I can do to fix that?

I'm sorry - I've never used bzr before ... how do I clone that repo, or whatever the equivalent is? ("bzr branch " didn't work for me - I get "not a branch")
