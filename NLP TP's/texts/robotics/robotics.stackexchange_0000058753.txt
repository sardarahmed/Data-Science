Q:

Starting rviz tutorial, fail to send markers

Hi Guys,
I am following rviz tutorial below
http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes
I have downloaded the C++ Codes and use catkin to make it as a ros-package. Then I have runned
roscore
rosrun rviz rviz
rosrun using_markers basic_shapes

But I still not able to find any markers and shapes in rviz.
After I  did rosrun using_markers basic_shapes, no information showed in the terminal. Can anyone help me this problem?
