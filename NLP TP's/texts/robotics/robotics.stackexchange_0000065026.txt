Q:

Best implementation of robot state control

Hello,
i have a simple robot which different states:

idle
do something
do something else
...

I wanted to change my states with some button inputs and every state has it own node.
I thought about a state machine with smach, but smach isn't under developing at the moment. Or can I use actionlib for that? I also found the package decision_making
What is the best approach to implement this in your experience? Or do you use something without ROS?
Thanks for your help

A:

smach is probably the best option.  It's not currently under development, but it works well, and and covers exactly what you want to do.

Thank you for your answer. Do you have a example/tutorial for smach with catkin_make? I tried it with groovy but it didn't work http://answers.ros.org/question/200512/smach-groovy/
