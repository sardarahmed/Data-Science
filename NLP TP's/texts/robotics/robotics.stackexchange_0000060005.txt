Q:

ueye package error

I install the driver and ros package successfully but when I launch this commande:
>$ roslaunch ueye_cam bayer_rggb_image_proc.launch

I got this error:
[bayer_rggb_image_proc.launch] is neither a launch file in package [ueye_cam] nor is [ueye_cam] a launch file name

What's going wrong ?

A:

I'll answer myself :D so that's how can everybody look at the solution
Just type this everytime you open a new shell:
$>cd /home/<name>/catkin_ws
$>source devel/setup.bash

Or you can add it to your .bashrc file as follows:
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
This way, every time you open your terminal the command "source ..." will run.

I tried to do that but it doesn't work
what I did is

$ cd
>$ gedit ~/.bashrc
and then I add this line <source devel/setup.bash> on the file at the end and I save it.
I don't know if do it right !?

So just gedit the ~/.bashrc file and add the follow two lines at the end: source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash and source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
