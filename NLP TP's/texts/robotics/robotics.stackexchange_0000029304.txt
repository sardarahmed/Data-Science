Q:

Question about command line's delay and array

So, I use command to load robots/ground by this line:
ign service -s /world/free_world/create --reqtype ignition.msgs.EntityFactory --reptype ignition.msgs.Boolean --timeout 300 --req 'sdf_filename: ''"models/sdf/new_ground.sdf" pose: {position: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}} ''name: "ground_%s" ''allow_renaming: true'
SO if I ran this with a loop, each line takes one second to load approximately. So, it seems that it has a delay. Is there any way to reduce the delay?
Also, is there a way to load more than 5 models at once?
Like for example:
ign service -s /world/free_world/create --reqtype ignition.msgs.EntityFactory --reptype ignition.msgs.Boolean --timeout 300 --req 'sdf_filename: ''"model1.sdf, model2.sdf,model3.sdf" 'pose: {position: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0},{x: 2, y: 0, z: 0},{x: 4, y: 0, z: 0}} '
Obviously, above is just guess or psuedo command line. Is there any official command for it?

A:

My first guess as to the delay is likely due to transport discovery. Each time you run the command gazebo's transport has to find the service.
You can send a batch request using the /world/WORLD_NAME/create_multiple service. In your example it would look like:
ign service -s /world/free_world/create_multiple --reqtype gnition.msgs.EntityFactory_V --reptype ignition.msgs.Boolean --timeout 2000 --req 'data{MODEL1_INFOMATION} data{MODEL2_INFORMATION} data{MODEL3_INFORMATION}'

This answered my questions, thank you so much!
Last question if you don't mind! What about remove? I couldn't find remove_multiple
