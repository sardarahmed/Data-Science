Q:

Wiki & Tutorial Updates

Hi everyone,
I couldn't find any proper procedure for updating the ROS wiki and tutorial pages, if there is one.  Specifically I'm looking at fleshing out the openSUSE installation section and some pages on using custom messages.
Are there any ROS-specific update procedure description pages?  I assume updating the openSUSE pages will be less of an issue than updating the widely used tutorials.
Thanks!

@joq Thanks.  I didn't see these links before, but now I see where they are linked from on the ROS wiki.
