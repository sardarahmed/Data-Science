Q:

Rviz xyz plane view

Hello, when I connected my Hokuyo laser to my computer and walked through the tutorials on How to use Hokuyo Laser Scanners with the hokuyo_node it changed Rviz to only view the XY plane. I feel like I'm just forgetting to change something very obvious but how do I change the plane view back to XYZ?

A:

There is a drop-down box in the "Views" panel that contains three choices: TopDownOrtho, Orbit, and FPS. If you select "Oribit", you'll be able to rotate in the XYZ planes.
