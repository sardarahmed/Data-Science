Q:

Where is the code that builds the Ubuntu packages?

I was hoping to find some ground truth for what comes with the .deb packages and how they are built.

A:

bloom is the tool in ROS which generates the Debian control files based on the metadata available in the package manifest.
ros_buildfarm is the Python package which drives the buildfarm which actually produces the .deb files. But uultimately it simply invokes gbp buildpackage and apt-src build.

It seems the ROS2 config is here: https://github.com/ros2/ci

That repository doesn't contain any logic to create Debian packages. It only creates logic for CI jobs.
