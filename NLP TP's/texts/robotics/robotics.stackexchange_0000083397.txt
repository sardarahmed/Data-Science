Q:

getParam questions

The var have_calibration is always evaluating to false. I also tried this with just
ros::NodeHandle nh 

and in place of that
ros::param::get 

and
  ros::NodeHandle nh("~");
  // kill program, if we don't have a camera calibration
  bool have_calibration = true;
  have_calibration = have_calibration && nh.getParam("/Cam_fx", Cam_fx);
  have_calibration = have_calibration && nh.getParam("/Cam_fy", Cam_fy);
  have_calibration = have_calibration && nh.getParam("/Cam_cx", Cam_cx);
  have_calibration = have_calibration && nh.getParam("/Cam_cy", Cam_cy);
  have_calibration = have_calibration && nh.getParam("/Cam_s", Cam_s);

from parameter server:
PARAMETERS
 * /Cam_cx: 0.500156
 * /Cam_cy: 0.515833
 * /Cam_fx: 0.0.836562
 * /Cam_fy: 1.1233333
 * /Cam_s: 0.4

I loaded the parameters using: in launch file.
<rosparam command="load" file="$(find skimap_ros)/SkimapPtamFixParams.yaml"/>    

There appears to be some kind of syntax or value error in the yaml file....but it is not reported . I will report back on the cause soon.

A:

The value
/Cam_fx: 0.0.836562

is causing the parameter sever to become corrupt can someone please verify this.

perhaps it does not see it as numeric and that causes the test to fail...but there should have been an error msg some where..no?

getParam doesn't display an error message. It indicates failure by returning false, allowing the user (you) to decide what to do. It seems you have answered your own question, so please select this answer as correct by clicking the checkmark.
