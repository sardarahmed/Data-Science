Q:

UWSim: Simulating RADAR using Multibeam Sensor

I would like to simulate a radar sensor in UWSim environment. I know that it is somehow possible using the multibeam sensor facility, but I would like to get some more ideas about how this could be achieved. Basically I want to get the distances of obstacles from the boat, and I want to do this with a radar mentality. Send rays and get the distances.
<multibeamSensor>
      <name>multibeam</name>
      <relativeTo>part0</relativeTo>
      <position>
        <x> -1.5 </x>
        <y> 0 </y>
        <z> 0 </z>
      </position>  
      <orientation>
        <r>0</r>
        <p>1.57</p>
        <y>0 </y>
      </orientation>
      <initAngle>-60</initAngle>
      <finalAngle>60</finalAngle>
      <angleIncr>0.1</angleIncr>
      <range>50</range>
</multibeamSensor>

How should I use the multibeam sensor facility in order to achieve this? Is there a way to visualize the rays, so that I can verify that I am not doing something odd?
Thanks in advance.

Hi,
Multibeam sensor provides the distance of obstacles from the sensor. You can visualize the rays using the visible tag "1" just after  relativeTo tag. Unfortunately this feature is not in the deb packages yet (next version), so you need to use UWSim from source. You should see something like this (right image is a zoom):
