Q:

$(catkin_LIBRARIES): no such files or directory

Hi,
I've created 2 packages and catkin_make results in twice the error above. The only dependencies in both CMakeList.txt and packages.xml are rospy, roscpp and std_msgs which are there. In $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, the ROS path is present, but not the path to my newly created packages. Is this a necessity? Any help or hints is appreciated.
Thanks
hvn

Can you post your CMakeList.txt, and ROS environment variable :) ?

Thanks for your response. William's answer solved it.

A:

I believe you want to do ${catkin_LIBRARIES}, with {} rather than ().
