Q:

Choosing a platform to start

I'd like to start with robotics, but unfortunately I know very little about HW engineering. Moreover I used to use such languages as Python, C# and Java, and do not have much experience in C. Still I want very much to be able to program a robot, and I have very big interest in Computer Vision and AI. Are there any platforms/kits that you can buy, and with little time spent you already can program them, preferably in high-order languages?
I'd prefer something wheeled (something flying would also be nice, but it may be too hard to be the case for a first robot), with a camera and some additional sensors. Would be also nice to have there something, that could help to avoid obstacles, like laser distance sensor or ultra-sonic sensor. Ideally I would like to build a robot that can navigate in the room without the help of operator. I'd like to look at SLAM some time in future, but for now I just need something to get familiar with the robotics.
Also it should probably be not very expensive, at least not before I will be very sure that I am ready to go deeper into robotics. Something for 300-500$ would be awesome.
Can somebody suggest kits/platforms/tutorials/any other info?

A:

I would suggest trying lego mindstorms. It removes a lot of the electronics, and mechanical barriers when starting to learn about robotics.
