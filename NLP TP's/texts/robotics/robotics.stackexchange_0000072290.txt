Q:

gmapping bag rviz problem

Hi,
I am following the gmapping tutorial
But rviz can not draw the map out:
I've add the MAP display,but with the error "No transform from [] to [map]".
No map disappear but a black square in the view.
Did I miss some key configurations?
Thanks!

A:

Choose /map in the Global options -> Fixed Frame menu.
Choose /map in the Map -> Topic menu.
