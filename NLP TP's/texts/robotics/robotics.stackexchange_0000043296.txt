Q:

Configure diagnostic aggregator to ignore a diagnostic?

Is it possible to configure the diagnostic aggregator to ignore a particular diagnostic message? In my case, the xsens_driver always publishes GPS warnings since there is no GPS attached.
I understand that this could be addressed at the driver layer, but it seems like something useful to have at the aggregator level.

A:

The docs say, there is a DiscardAnalyzer. I've never used it though.
