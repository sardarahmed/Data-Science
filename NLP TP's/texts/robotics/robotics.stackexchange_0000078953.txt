Q:

Service "ERROR: Unable to load type" for a remote Master

My setup is an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS VM on Win10, and RaspberryPi running Ubuntu Mate 16.04 LTS. I have ROS Kinetic installed on both of the Ubuntu machines and they can ping each other with hostname fine.
I wrote a new node on my remote Master (which is the RPi) that exposes 2 services and I can call the services fine locally on the RPi. The node is reachable from the Ubuntu VM, I can rosnode ping and can see it in rosservice list. However, when I rosservice info it from the VM, I get:
$ rosservice info get_humid_rh  
Node: /sht15_node  
URI: rosrpc://mlotfy-pi:36003  
Type: sht15/GetHumidRh  
ERROR: Unable to load type [sht15/GetHumidRh].  
Have you typed 'make' in [sht15]?

When I try to rosservice call it from the VM, I get:
$ rosservice call get_humid_rh  
ERROR: Unable to load type [sht15/GetHumidRh].  
Have you typed 'make' in [sht15]?

What could be missing here?

A:

Message definitions will need to be present on all hosts that want to participate in the ROS node graph.
In other words: make sure the workspace in your VM has a copy of the message package and build the workspace.
PS: this is one of the reasons why having packages with just messages is a good idea: that way you can access remote services / topics without needing to have the rest of the software duplicated as well.

You made my day! That worked. Thanks for the design advice as well, it will take me sometime to learn ROS design patterns.
