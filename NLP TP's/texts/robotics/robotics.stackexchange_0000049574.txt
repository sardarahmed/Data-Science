Q:

PTU schunk PW70 drivers

Hi everyone,
As my experience is limited within ROS, I would like to ask what is the best procedure to follow in order to connect the PTU Schunk PW70. The PTU is connected via serial-to-USB adapter but so far, my efforts with COB packages and ki-ros-pkg available online in "github.com/alesko/ki-ros-pkg/tree/master/amtec" were unsuccessful. So I would really appreciate if someone has any directions to follow.
