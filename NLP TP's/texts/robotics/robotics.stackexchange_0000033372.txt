Q:

use a single static_transform_publisher for multiple sensors

Hello everyone,
I just started using ros to build a sonar sensor array composed of 16 sensors. I was wondering if there is a way to use a single static_transform_publisher to broadcast all the sensors frames to tf instead of creating a node for each sensors, which i think would introduce some overhead (16 processes vs. 1).
Please correct me if i'm wrong, or suggest an alternative solution to static_transform_publisher if it isn't the best way to do this.

A:

As @arebgun mentioned you can publish them all manually.  Or if you create a URDF  and use robot_state_publisher it will publish them all for you.

What do you mean it can't find the frames?  I suggest you ask a new question explaining what you did and what errors you get.

I tried this solution, but TransformListener can't find the frames I defined in the URDF file, while they show up correctly in tf_monitor and tf_echo...

Completely forgot about robot_state_publisher and URDF. I think that would be the best long term solution.
