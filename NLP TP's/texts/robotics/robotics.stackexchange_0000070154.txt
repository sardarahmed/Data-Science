A:

Hello!
I found  solution. Just my mistake. I modified the serial_out.msg file and I modified the subscribe file in my project. The publisher file was not modified. I did catkin_make, rosrun my nodes and got an error, because the subscribe file has been compiled with the new header files serial_out.msg and the publisher file with the old. Everything was very simple.
P.S. Sorry for my english. I hope the meaning is clear. Thank you.
