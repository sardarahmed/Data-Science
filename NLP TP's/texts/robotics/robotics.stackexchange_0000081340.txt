Q:

visp_tracker /object_position dimension

Hello there,
I have followed the http://wiki.ros.org/visp_tracker tutorial.
Then, I can changed this tutorial by creating my own .launch file, where I give to the node the params I need for get images from my cams.
Now, I want to control the head of my robot, and for that I have developed a rospy node which subscribe to /object_position but the point is (and sorry if it is a obvius question) that I don't know and I haven't found it, which are the position and rotation dimensions. I mean, this position, I assume that are not in real world coordinates, but in scalated pixels?
How can I convert this values to real world values in order to develop my control?
Thanks for your answers.

Well, I have been looking around, and I have found this website: http://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-2.9.0/tutorial-calibration.html
With this, what I am not sure now, is what information is given by /object_position with two vectors: Position {x, y, z} and Rotation {x, y, z, w}

A:

Ok! I am going to solve this issue myself.
The fact is this /object_position in deed returns the actual object position in meters.
My main issue was that I had done a calibration for stereovision in place of a calibration for each camera.
