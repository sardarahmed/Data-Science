Q:

How to initialize a subscriber only when a 'if' condition meets?

Hello.
I want to initialize a subscriber only when
if(i>0){              // 'i' is received as node argument
  ros::Subscriber sub = nh.subscribe("/image_rect_color/compressed", 1, imageCallback);
  }

Problem I am facing is: main thread comes into if-scope but couldn't initialize the subscriber.
I guess problem is introduction of new scope.
BTW:This code is in main().
How can this problem be solved?
Thanks

A:

ros::Subscriber sub;

if(i>0){              // 'i' is received as node argument
sub = nh.subscribe("/image_rect_color/compressed", 1, imageCallback);
}

This worked for me.
