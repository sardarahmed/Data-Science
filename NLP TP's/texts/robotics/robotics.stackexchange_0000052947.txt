Q:

lse_xsens_mti error ubuntu 12.04

Linux: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bits
ROS: fuerte
Intel core 2 duo E8400
device: Xsens MTi-G-28A53G35

I have some troubles with this package:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/lse_xsens_mti
I have to install some dependencies like gps_commons and cereal_port. When I resolve the dependencies, I do rosmake and the package is installed with 0 problems.
I launch with xsensDriver.launch and everything seems to work very well but not is this case, the topics are publishing at good rate but all empty.
I get all values 0.
I don't know what I must do from here.
Any Ideas?

A:

Ok, the problem is the configuration of synchronism mode in the device.
If one program configure the device in synchronism mode, this pkg publish only 0 in all topics.
I wonder if there are some way to change the sync mode to async mode with this pkg.
Somebody?
