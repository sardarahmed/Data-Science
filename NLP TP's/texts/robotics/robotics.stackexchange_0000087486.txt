A:

You'll want the tf2_ros/static_transform_publisher.
tf2 is designed to be ROS agnostic (aka no roscpp or rospy) tf2_ros has all the ROS client library bindings.

Thank you so much.
Can you tell me why my queternion seems invalid:
Ignoring transform for child_frame_id "100" from authority "unknown_publisher" because of an invalid quaternion in the transform (0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000)

?

It's not normalized. Read more at #q9981 And please don't ask unrelated follow up questions in comments. It's bad for discoverability.

Okay, thanks. Point duly noted.
