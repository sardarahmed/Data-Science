Q:

Split ROSbag to two

Hi All,
I am using rosindigo on two computers. I am using a ROS bag which includes sensor data from a robot (it's the Cartographer Deutsches museum 2D dataset) used to build a map.
I would like to split the bag such that I will be able to run it as if it's collected from two robots, so lets say if the bag is 2000sec long the I would like to split it to two 1000sec bags and treat it as if both halves where collected at the same time by two different robots.
Would I be able to do this using rosbag filter? If so how? Would I need to fix time-stamping in the rosbag?
I am a relatively new user so would be happy for pointers...
Thanks

Split it as in first half and second half w.r.t time?
Comment by ecidon on 2018-05-01:
The first half time, so lets say the whole bag runs form 0-2000sec and we have a message each second I would like to have
sec 1: message 1 from first half + message 1 from second half
sec 2: message 2 from first half + message 2 from second half

See #q99711
Comment by robotchicken on 2018-05-02:
Since the messages have to be played simultaneously, the messages would have to be time stamped accordingly. So I am guessing #q99711 wouldn't apply.
Either way, please mark the question as resolved based on the answer that worked.
