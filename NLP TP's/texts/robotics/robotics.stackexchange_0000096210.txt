Q:

controller type 'position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController' does not exist

I try to follow a tutorial in the "Programming Robots with ROS" book. In this tutorial I want to show and move my own robot model in Gazebo. The URDF description loads correctly in Gazebo, the model is shown. Then I extended the URDF by dynamics and ros_control. When I launch the configuration, there are errors from gazebo_ros_control, that my controller could not be loaded. controller type 'position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController' does not exist.
In the Doc of JointTrajectoryController http://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_controller in the minimal description, position interface is written, that type: "position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController" should be used.  In my case this leads to the above error. 
My controller definition:arm_controller:
type: "position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController"
joints:
- hip
- shoulder
- elbow
- wrist

rosservice call controller_manager/list_controller_types
types: 
  - diff_drive_controller/DiffDriveController
  - joint_state_controller/JointStateController
  - position_controllers/JointGroupPositionController
  - position_controllers/JointPositionController
base_classes: 
  - controller_interface::ControllerBase
  - controller_interface::ControllerBase
  - controller_interface::ControllerBase
  - controller_interface::ControllerBase 
There it shows position_controllers only with JointPositionController. In this case my arm_controller is not found.

My Environment:

Ubuntu focal
ROS - noetic
Which is the correct way to follow, to bring my robot to life?
rostopic list should show my arm_controller. But it is not loaded.

Think I got it to work. I changed JointTrajectoryController to JointGroupPositionController. /arm_controller is now loaded and a topic /arm_controller/command is visible. Now I must see, how I can get functionality of the JointTrajectoryController.

Thank you xibeisiber. Your answer helped me. Only I had to install ros-noetic-joint-trajectory-controller. This one was not automatically installed.
