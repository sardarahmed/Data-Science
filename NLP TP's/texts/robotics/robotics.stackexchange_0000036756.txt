Q:

"apt-get source" for packages.ros.org?

Where are the sources (*.orig.tar.gz, *.diff.gz, and *.dsc files) for the debs on packages.ros.org?
Specifically, how to make "apt-get source" do the right thing for packages from this repository?  Adding the obvious deb-src line to ros-latest.list doesn't seem to help (see below).  Poking around on the packages.ros.org http interface, it looks to me like the sources have not been uploaded.
Packages I care about include ROS dependencies like assimp, yaml-cpp, and eigen.  For example,
$ apt-cache policy libassimp2
libassimp2:
  Installed: 2.0.0.6-ubuntu1~lucid1
  Candidate: 2.0.0.6-ubuntu1~lucid1

A:

Just a follow-up; with the current package repository of ros.org (Sep 2014), you can obtain the source of the released packages by simply apt-get source. No deb-src needed. I documented it here.
Update 12/10/2014) deb-src seems to be required. I updated the link above too.
Edit with full instructions:
You just need to explicitly specify deb-src entry in the apt sources:
For example update /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros_latest.list as follows:
  deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main
+ deb-src http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main

This assumes precise substitute your applicable ubuntu distro.
$ apt-get source ros-hydro-laser-pipeline

This downloads from the server all the files in the released version of the package (i.e. things not installed in the installation rule (e.g. CMakeLists.txt) are also included).

This does not seem to work for me. I'm running Hydro on 12.04, e.g., both
apt-get source ros-hydro-gmapping

and
apt-get source ros-hydro-slam-gmapping

return E: Unable to find a source package for ros-hydro-slam-gmapping.
Am I missing something?

@damjan I've updated my post above.

@130s that's not an appropriate place to put that information. Placing that at the end of the procedural instructions will distract/confuse beginner users as it's not necessary/useful for them to get started. It should be documented for power users, where I think this thread is pretty good.
Comment by tfoote on 2014-12-09:
I would also highly recommend using rosinstall generator instead of apt-get source for fetching packages as you will get a version controlled source.

I pulled the full content in here and promoted this answer. It's already the top search result for apt-get dsc ros https://www.google.com/search?q=apt-get+dsc+ros

@tfoote Very much agreed.
