Q:

Quadcopter cannot balance!

I am bulding a quadcopter using these compenents:

Microcontroller: Tiva C Lanchpad (ARM Cortex M4 - 80 MHz), but
running at 40MHz in my code
MPU 9150 - Sensorhub TI
ESC - Hobbywing Skywalker 40A

I use the sample project comp_dcm from Tivaware and use that angles for my PID which running at 100Hz
I test PID Control on 2 motors, but the motors oscillate as in the video i found on youtube from one guy!
Quadcopter  Unbalance

A:

A couple possibilities come to mind,

PIDs need tuning, this is relatively simple (entire books have been written on it)

Basically, set the I and D terms to 0 and slowly move up the P term till it oscillates and turn it down again to just below that point

Your code is running too slowly (this can cause all kinds of odd errors)
