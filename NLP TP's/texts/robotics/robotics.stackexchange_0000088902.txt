Q:

Display only one layer of a costmap in rviz

Hi everyone,
I have a costmap with two layers (static_layer and inflation_layer) and I would like to be able to display them separately or in different colors because it is difficult to distinguish the two (there is only a very small difference in brightness between them) :

Thanks in advance for your advices!
[UPDATE]
As advised by David Lu, I changed the Color Scheme of my costmap from map to costmap:

A:

There is not currently functionality to visualize layer by layer, but you can change the color scheme of the OccupancyGrid display in rviz to Costmap, which will make the color differences more apparent.

Thanks, it's exactly what I needed. If I understand correctly, the purple zone corresponds to the real geometry of the obstacle and the light blue corresponds to place where the robot center can never be, whatever its orientation, right?

That is correct.

Hi, if the light blue represents the inflation layer, what's the meaning of the dark blue layer? Thank!
Comment by David Lu on 2022-10-06:
The light blue comes from the inflation layer, but more things come from the inflation layer. Light blue/red/dark blue are different values in the actual costmap (253 down to 1)
