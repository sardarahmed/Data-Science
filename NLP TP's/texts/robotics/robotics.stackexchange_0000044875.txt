Please dont delete older questions by overwriting them. Nobody would be able to interpret the answers, without the appropriate question.

A:

Since this is a very generic question, the answer has to be very generic, too.  You should work your way through the other tutorials at ros.org.  They describe the mechanisms of ROS in detail.  One of the examples is very close to the use case you gave in a comment to your question.
