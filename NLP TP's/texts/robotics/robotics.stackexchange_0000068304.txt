Q:

ROS indigo key server down

Hello all;
I am trying to install ROS indigo in a new system, but keyserver is down:
alberto@OptiPlex-9010:~$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116
Executing: gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --homedir /tmp/tmp.ryx941KSlA --no-auto-check-trustdb --trust-model always --keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --primary-keyring /etc/apt/trusted.gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0xB01FA116
gpg: requesting key B01FA116 from hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net
gpg: keyserver timed out
gpg: keyserver receive failed: keyserver error
alberto@OptiPlex-9010:~$ 

Is there any possibility to set up keys manually and continue with installation?
Thank you all in advance,

Have you tried just going ahead and installing (e.g. sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full)? What errors do you get when attempting that?

A:

The keyserver seems to be back up now. If it goes down again you can use this to get the key from github over an SSL connection.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
