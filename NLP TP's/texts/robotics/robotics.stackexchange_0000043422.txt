Q:

Gazebo can't find rendering system

Hi everyone ! I have installed  the linux OS Ubuntu 12.04 and gazebo-1.0.1 on my laptop. Although the installation of Ubuntu 12.04 is successful, I ran into some issues while running gazebo. I hope that you guys can give me some advices on how to resolve them.
I have already installed the debian package of gazebo 1.0.1 using the software centre and set the environment variables as described in the online instructions. However, when i tried to run " gzserver" in the terminal. it returned the following error
Msg Waiting for master
Msg Connected to gazebo master @ http://localhost:11345
Error [RenderEngine.cc:356] Unable to load Ogre Plugin[/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/OGRE-1.7.4/Plugin_CgProgramManager.so]...Skipping
After that I added OGRE PPA, but it didn't help. I then downloaded and installed latest version of OGRE and run "gzserver" again, but it gave me another set of  errors,
Exception [RenderEngine.cc:468] unable to find rendering system
Error [Rendering.cc:37] Failed to load the Rendering engine subsystem
unable to find rendering system
Exception [RenderEngine.cc:468] unable to find rendering system
Exception [Sensors.cc:39] Unable to load the rendering engine
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'gazebo::common::Exception'
Aborted (core dumped)
Could anyone here help me with this issue? Thanks in advance.

A:

i think your gazebo is not completely integrated with ogre...you have to install gazebo with source pkg as in debian package it does not completely integrates with ogre...other things u can do is that to check whether u have setup environment variables correctly.

Thanks Kumar. I understand that you solved the problem by reinstalling using source pkg. May I know did you encounter problems while doing Cmake? I encountered build error ( e.g.missing: tinyxml) while doing Cmake. I followed the steps in the Readme text.
