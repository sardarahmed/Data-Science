Q:

How to add dynamically a package in the manifest.xml file in python?

Hello,
I program in python and javascript.
Firstly, my node make a list of all published topics and their types.
Then, after a human interaction in JavaScript, it subscribes to a topic and imports the library necessary to define the subscriber.
My question is how include this package in the manifest.xml file of this node during its execution.
Waiting for earing from u,
Have fun with ROS

A:

you can call roslib.load_manifest(package_name) of any package to add it to the sys.path of your node's execution.
