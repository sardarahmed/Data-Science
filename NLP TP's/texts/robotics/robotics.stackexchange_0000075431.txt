Q:

Are there Windows Compatible ROS nodes?

I am trying to write a program in Windows that is able to send packets to a ROS node. It does not necessarily have to be a Windows node, just a program that runs on a Windows machine and can send ROS (linux) -compatible packets for another computer running Linux to handle/receive those packets via a ROS node.
Does roscore (the 'Master' node) influence this in any way?

A:

Publishing and subscribing to ROS topics is not just a matter of sending properly-formatted packets. Your program also needs to communicate with the ROS master to advertise its topic, and it needs to negotiate the topic setup when other ROS nodes want to subscribe to that topic. The technical overview goes through the details of topic setup if you're interested.
Instead of running a full publisher on your windows machine, you can run a ROS node which bridges a simpler transport mechanism into ROS.
Two of the more popular approaches for this are:

Encode your messages as JSON and communicate over a websocket to rosbridge. (easy)
Use rosserial_windows to tunnel messages over TCP to the rosserial_server. (better performance)

Hi I have been trying to do this Using JSON over rosbridge, But haven't been able to figure it out. I tried to just create a Python script on Windows and connect to the port that rosbridge is running on and listen for JSON queries. And it just didn't work. Is this the right approach or not?
