HERE IS MY CODE
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import time
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import Float64
from Tkinter import *

rospy.init_node('adi', anonymous=True)
pub1 = rospy.Publisher('/joint1/command', Float64, queue_size=10)
.
.
.
pub10 = rospy.Publisher('/joint10/command', Float64, queue_size=10)

def a():
    pub1.publish(3)   # It sets the motor to center position
.
.
.
.
    pub10.publish(3)
    print  w1.get(), w2.get() , w3.get(), w4.get() , w5.get() , w6.get() , w7.get() , w8.get() , w9.get() , w10.get() 
    pub1.publish(w1.get()*0.01)
    .
.

.
         pub10.publish(w10.get()*0.01)

master = Tk()
master.title("ADI")
w1 = Scale(master, from_=-360, to=360, orient=HORIZONTAL,length=300)
w1.pack()

Could it be related to the fact that your shift or caps-lock keys seem to be stuck?

I've fixed your question title. Please don't use ALL CAPS for titles; it's the online equivalent of shouting and is considered rude on this forum.

A:

I used 2 different files a1.py & a2.py to write 2 different functions of five arguments (for each motor) in each py file.   i called those functions from other py file to communicate to the motors at a time. I succeeded for my operation what i want to do.
