Q:

Terminal Software for ROS/Ubuntu?

I have recently used http://realterm.sourceforge.net/ in Windows-7. Is there any such Terminal Software suitable for ROS or may be specific to Ubuntu ? It is a great help since it scans for open ports in my computer, and once connected, can send commands and receive data from device/robot.
