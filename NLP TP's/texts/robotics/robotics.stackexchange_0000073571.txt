Q:

different rpm/port/return type velodyne VLP16

Hi Everyone,
I'm trying to figure out how to launch the velodyne driver if a vlp16 is using different parameters such as :
-Different RPM
-Different Port

return type
Destination IP address

I've been testing out : roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch pcap:="path_to_pcap_file" on "standard" pcap files, and I'm not even sure that's correct..
That would be for a pcap file, but I'm not convinced if I had mine connected on how to launch the driver with different configurations.
I've seen various questions for the 32 and 64 model, and even that was unclear so I figured I would just ask it here.
Thanks in advance,

A:

Several recently added parameters are missing as arguments to the installed launch scripts. I just opened issue #90 to fix that.
Meanwhile, I suggest you create copies of velodyne_driver/launch/nodelet_manager.launch and velodyne_pointcloud/launch/VLP16_points.launch in some package of your own, then edit them to add the desired parameters. Don't forget to make VLP16_points.launch refer to your copy of nodelet_manager.launch. You might want to rename those files to avoid confusion.
If you want more detail, say so in a comment, and I'll try to make a complete example.
