Q:

catkin build stuck on rospack failure

POST EDIT
I'm installing on El Capitan (os x 10.11.1) and it appears that a lot of people are having issues with this version of os x without a solution. In my scouring the web I've found a handful other people running into the same issues.
ORIGINAL
$ catkin build  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
fails with:

I know Python is installed. I even added the location to .bash_profile like so:
echo "export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile

But I'm still stuck. How can I get past this issue?

Are you sure Python.h file exists?
Comment by jacksonkr_ on 2015-12-11:
find / -name "Python.h" finds the file in a number of different spots. Is there a specific one I need to check for?
Comment by William on 2015-12-14:
Have you tried using catkin_make_isolated instead? catkin build is still in beta.

A:

No luck with any of this so far. I ended up getting everything installed after I switched to Ubuntu 12.04 ran from a virtual machine using these tutorials:
https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=ros%20install%20hydro
http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/
PS- I had luck on 14.04.03 with ROS indigo and rgbdslam. There were numerous errors but I eventually figured them out. Still have camera issues though.

I was able to get everything installed on el capitan. I'm not sure what I did exactly beside ignoring one error saying that gazebo could not be detected (second to last step: $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro jade -y)
