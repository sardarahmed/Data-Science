Q:

How do I create a rosserial_arduino package under Cmake with Groovy?

Working with rosserial_arduino within the Arduino IDE is tedious and I would like to start using CMake to automate builds of my package.  Unfortunately, the following tutorial seems woefully out of date for Groovy:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/CMake
The tutorial uses roscreate-pkg, but the cmake scripts were removed from rosserial_arduino a few months back by Fergs.  I guess the reason why is explained here.
Can anyone provide hints how to get rosserial_arduino based projects working with cmake under Arduino?  A pointer to an existing package for Groovy that I could copy under github or something would be terrific.
Thanks,
Mike Thompson

A:

The old Cmake scripts are still in the repository history. Unfortunately, they were out of date and so they were removed as I didn't have time to update them. If someone updates them and opens a pull request to merge them back in, in an updated form, I'm sure the rosserial team would merge that request.

OK thanks for the info.  I'm looking at the ROS Arduino Bridge as well so I may pursue that route.
