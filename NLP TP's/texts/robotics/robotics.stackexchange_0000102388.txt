Q:

pass agruments/parameters to included launch file in yaml

How would you pass arguments / parameters to an included launch file? The following doesn't work and gives the following error: Unexpected key(s) found in 'include': {'param'} 
launch:

- include:
    file: "$(find-pkg-share test)/launch/test.launch.py"
    param:
    -
      name: "color"
      value: "red"

A:

use "arg" instead of "param" to pass arguments into an included launch file. Names and values must all be strings in quotes.
launch:

- include:
    file: "$(find-pkg-share test)/launch/test.launch.py"
    arg:
    -
      name: "color"
      value: "red"
