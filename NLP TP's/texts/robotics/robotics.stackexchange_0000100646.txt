Q:

launch file: parameters via -- (double dash) don't go well with commenting

I have a rqt being loaded with a custom perspective, see:
<node name="my_rqt_dashboard" pkg="rqt_gui" type="rqt_gui" respawn="false" output="screen" 
    args="--perspective-file $(find my_rospkg)/cfg/viz/asdf.perspective"/>

My "problem" is that commenting out that line breaks the xml, as double hyphen are not allowed in comments, see Link.
A workaround is to use  &#45;&#45; instead of --, but that is kind of ugly.
Any other ideas? Unfortunately, the --perspective-file does not seem to have a single hyphen equivalent, e.g. -q

I put a space in between the two hyphens, so I have <!-- - -perspective-file -->. In my particular case it's a gdb command line, and luckily its argument parser interprets - -foo as --foo, so I don't need to remember to remove the space when commenting back in. FYI, this is my usual way for debugging a crashing node <!-- launch-prefix="xterm -e gdb -ex 'catch throw' -ex 'catch syscall 60' -ex run - -args" -->.

A:

There seems to be a way to make comments like this.
<?ignore
<node name="my_rqt_dashboard" pkg="rqt_gui" type="rqt_gui" respawn="false" output="screen" 
    args="--perspective-file $(find my_rospkg)/cfg/viz/asdf.perspective"/>
?>

( <?ignore <stuff> ?>, and <stuff> is said to be a comment. )
