Q:

why the command : rosrun libuvc_camera followed by UVCCamera.cfg not the uvccamera_node?

Hi:
I'm new to ROS system, and i have a problem when using the libuvc_camera package;
below are my steps:

Firstly,  clone the libuvc_camera from  https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc_ros
commands in the consol : cd libuvc_camera ;  mkdir build;  cd build;  cmake .. ; make ; sudo make install
commands:  source devel/setup.bash
then if i run the command:  rosrun libuvc_camera  camera_node;  it display messages : couldn't found executable file camera_node in libuvc_camera ; found  libuvc_camera/build/devel/lib/libuvc_camera/camera_node  but it is  not a executable file;
and when i use the tab; it display commands: rosrun libuvc_camera UVCCamera.cfg
can somebody tell me what is the problem ? thanks!

A:

I guess you should have done more like:

create the workspace folder
create src folder inside workspace
clone into src folder
execute catkin_make in workspace folder

and before the last one you could install the needed dependencies as seen here:
http://answers.ros.org/question/75241/install-ros-dependencies-from-apt/
Btw you should also be able to install it by package manager I guess
it should be just sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-libuvc-camera

Christian

Thanks very much;  i have done what you suggest; and the workspace build successfully.
Now i want to run the camera_node in the libuvc_camera package, and manual its focus absolute;
Can you please give me some more suggestions?
Thanks so much!

I guess you should create a new question for that. Cause having an error and making it run and specific settings are completely different things.
