Q:

calling a python script from cmake

I have written a Python script to parse some data from a csv file which lists out all the errors during the runtime of my robot. Now I want to call this Python script from CMake. What is the best way to do this?

You really want to "call from CMake" or something like rosrun your_package your_parser.py?

A:

In cmake there's something called execute_process. Look here for documentation.
