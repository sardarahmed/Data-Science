Q:

navigation stack costmap problem in front of robot

Hello everybody! I'm trying to use navigation stack on husky. Gmapping works great, pose estimate too but when I'm trying to do a nav goal, and the robot starts moving, in front of it there's always a block of occupied cells in the costmap, when ideed there are no obstacles. Why?
unfortunatly I cannot upload a photo

A:

Is your laser scanner scanning the edges/corners of your robot? I had a problem like this and i decreased the scan angle and it worked.
