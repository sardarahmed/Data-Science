Q:

Why import my own cad file is more slow than import PR2 cad model?

I tried to covert my own cad file to stl file.
And I use the command to import
  rosrun gazebo spawn_model -file foot.urdf -urdf -model top -z 0.5

I have waited several minutes but do not see any progress or message.
Why it be so slow? And how do I speed up?
Thank you~

Please upload your URDF and STL files somewhere.

A:

I have tried to reduce the resolution of my stl file.
I found 3 ways to do it,and I only try the third.
1.Use SOLIDCast to reduce the triangle number.

2.Use 3ds Max to reduce the vertex.

3.Use Inventor to export stl file with options.
It can be choice : high,medium,low,custom
What I found is if I try to import the same motor stl with different resolution successfully,
 load motor_lowest.stl（296k，about 0 sec）
 load motor_low.stl（512k，about 0 sec）
 load motor_medium.stl（1028k，about 3 sec）
 load motor_high.stl（2820k，about 10 sec）
 load motor_highest.stl（51M, very very long）
