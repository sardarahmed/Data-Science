Q:

tf2_eigen include does not find library Eigen/Geometry

Hi,
I want to use tf2_eigen to convert geometry_msgs/Vector3 messages (and further geometry_msgs) to eigen-vectors to use them for calculations.
The preprocessor does not find this include in tf2_eigen:  #include <Eigen/Geometry>
I deem the reason for this is that eigen3 is installed on my computer and the path should be: <eigen3/Eigen/Geometry>
Do you have an idea how I can handle this problem? I have no permission to change the tf2_eigen file.
Additionaly my CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(px4_data_observer)
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  message_filters
  geometry_msgs
  sensor_msgs
  eigen_conversions
  tf2
  tf2_eigen
)
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
catkin_package(
)
include_directories(
  include
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${Eigen_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

Thank you in advanced!

A:

I include now Eigen3 and fixed a misstake I did in my code. I used the wrong namespace. Instead of the correct tf2::fromMsg () I used Eigen::fromMsg() because the autocomplition suggests this. My preprocessor still does not find the Eigen/Geometry include but building works. Also the function tf2::fromMsg() works now :) Thank you very much for the hint!
