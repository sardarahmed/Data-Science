Q:

Problems with gazebo plugin tutorials

Hi, I am now doing the gazebo plugin tutorial and came across some difficulties doing rosmake. My cpp file is
#include "gazebo.hh"
#include "physics/physics.h" 
#include "common/Events.hh" 
#include "common/Plugin.hh" 
#include "common/Time.hh" 
#include "common/common.h"

namespace gazebo
{
  class PluginTemplate : public Plugin
  {
    public: PluginTemplate() : Plugin() 
            {
            }
    
    public: void Load( sdf::ElementPtr &_sdf )
            {
            };

    
  };
   
  GZ_REGISTER_PLUGIN(PluginTemplate)
   
}

However, I got the following error while running rosmake
"home/chengxiang/gazebo_tutorials/src/simple_world_plugin.cpp:26:1: error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘}’ token"

the "}" in question here is the last "}"
Could any kind soul please enlighten me on how to solve this issue?
