A:

You could be missing either printenv or grep.
What is the output of which printenv and of which grep?

i have the same problem .
output of which printenv is "/usr/bin/printenv"
and which grep is "/bin/grep"

On Ubuntu, /bin/grep is provided by the grep package. /usr/bin/printenv by coreutils.
Do you have those pkgs installed? You can check with dpkg -l | grep 'coreutils\|grep'.

Note btw that you can also use env to print the currently defined environment variables.
