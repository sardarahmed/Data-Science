Q:

King Robota: Does he speak for himself?

I want to know if its currently possible for a robot to speak by it self as King Robota does, or is just someone speaking on his behalf?

A:

Not only is a human voice behind this (likely through a vocoder), I believe you are looking at a mechanized costume and not an actual robot -- someone is inside.  
Using fake robots to attract crowds has worked since "Elektro" at the 1939 World's Fair (video).  You can also buy your own King Robota suit if you want to take up this form of entertainment yourself.
A more interesting question is how the costume's mouth reacts to the incoming speech, to emulate actual speaking.
