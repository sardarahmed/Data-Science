Q:

Missing links in new camera stack wiki pages

I recently created several new camera driver stacks:

camera1394
prosilica_driver
wge100_driver

While working on their documentation pages in the ROS wiki, I have been unable to get the "ChangeList" and "Releases" links to display, despite the fact that those sub-pages actually exist.
Also, the "Dependencies" and "Used by" links on the camera1394 page show up, but do nothing when clicked.
Is some additional documentation index update required for these new stacks?

The "ChangeList" and "Releases" problems seem to have been fixed as a side-effect of some other change. A workaround for the "Dependencies" problem is described below.

The "Dependencies" and "Used by" problem was caused by a bad interaction between the Version() and StackHeader() macros, fixed by moving the StackHeader() outside the Version() scope.
