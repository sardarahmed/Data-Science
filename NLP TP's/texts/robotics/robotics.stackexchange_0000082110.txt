A:

This problem is solved by doing exactly what it told you: "Please create a subscriber to the marker"
When you do rosrun using_markers basic_shapes, this node publishes to topic /visualization_markers. You can verify that markers are being published by running rostopic echo /visualisation_markers in another terminal.
To visualise the marker in rviz, you have to do few additional things in rviz:

Add display of Marker (this subscribes to the marker topic)
Change the Fixed frame to my_frame (this is specified in line 47 of basic_shapes node)
