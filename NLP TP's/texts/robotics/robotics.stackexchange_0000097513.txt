Q:

external config for spdlog or ability to set custom filename for log in ros2

Is there anything in the pipeline in terms of building ability to read external config files for the default logger, spdlog?
Alternatively, does a method exist or is currently being developed, for setting custom names for log files?

A:

Afaik, the implementation of the default logger (spdlog) does not currently support custom log configuration:
https://github.com/ros2/rcl_logging/blob/galactic/rcl_logging_spdlog/src/rcl_logging_spdlog.cpp#L73
If you compile ROS2 from source, you can use log4cxx instead, which does support external configuration. There are however a number of other issues with that (which is why the default logging system was changed to spdlog).
