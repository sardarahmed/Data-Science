MoveIt Setup Assistant ROS Jade

What is the preferred method for installing the MoveIt Setup Assistant with ROS Jade? Do I need to build from source?

Looking at ros.org/debbuild/jade?q=moveit (and wiki/moveit_setup_assistant), it looks like it hasn't been released for Jade yet.
Building from source would seem to be your only option.
