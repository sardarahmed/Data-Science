Q:

ar_kinect compile error conversion from ‘tf::Transform’ to non-scalar type ‘btTransform’ requested

Hi, I am trying to rosmake the ar_kinect package on Ubuntu 11.10 and I get the following error. It is the last package I need to before running the mini_max grasp object tutorial, so any help would be appreciated.
I also get a lot of warnings prior to the error, so I have included those as well.
Thanks,
-Scott

A:

This error most likely has to do with changes to the tf datatypes for fuerte as described in this migration guide. If there is no migrated version available, you probably have to fix the package yourself for fuerte.

in the page you mentioned, I solved my problems running the scritpt:
rosrun tf bullet_migration_sed.py
