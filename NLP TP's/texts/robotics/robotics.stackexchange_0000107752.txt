Q:

How to turn the wheels on a robot that uses ros_control?

I have made a robot with 4 wheels and it uses ros_control. At the moment I can use a python script to make it move forward and backward but I don't know how to make the wheels turn as it only has the /command topic which accepts a Float64 data input so no linear and angular axis inputs like /cmd_vel etc. Am I able to make the robot subscribe to another topic, if yes, how do I do that?
Github code for the robot: here.
The whole project can be launched using the following command if you want to run it on your own machine:
roslaunch ford_bot launch_all.launch

Some guidance on this would be very much appreciated.

A:

So I managed to fix the issue. I removed the ros_control controllers I was using and replaced the control for the robot with the skid steer plugin which I found out about in this video and now I can move my robot with the teleop keyboard node that's readily available to send messages on the cmd_vel topic which the robot is already subscribed to. The new code is available on my GitHub. The roslaunch ford_bot launch_all.launch command will launch the robot and gazebo etc. and then you can use the rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py command to control the robot.
