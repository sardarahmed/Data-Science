searching for ros2 and web brought back many manuals mentioning ros(1 ?) and web tools or rosbridge.

A:

Depending on how the web frontend is designed it might not even be tight to a specific ROS version. E.g. when using the Robot Web Tools your client side code only talks to a websocket.
A few of these server-side packages have already been ported to ROS 2. The last repository is currently in the process of being ported: https://github.com/ros2/rosbridge_suite/issues/1 Once that work is complete you should be able to use a webfrontend developed for ROS 1 in the same way for ROS 2.
One example of such a webfrontend is an RViz-like interface: https://github.com/osrf/rvizweb

thanks for that ! will be watching the releases there The new server side implementation looks like a pure python based one. the old one requiered nodejs so that is probably a good change
