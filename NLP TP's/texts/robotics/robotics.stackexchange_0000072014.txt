Q:

Convert from Int32MultiArray into vector (roscpp)

How to simply put array from the std_msgs into vector<double>
 void setdot(const std_msgs::Int32MultiArray::ConstPtr& arr){
    vector<double> tmp;
        tmp.push_back(arr[0]);
        tmp.push_back(arr[1]);
        tmp.push_back(arr[2]);
}

error: invalid use of void expression if i compile it.

A:

For anyone who is interested I had a look at this, which converts the std_msgs into an Array but this is how the vector is done:
    void setdot(const std_msgs::Int32MultiArray::ConstPtr& array){
    vector<double> tmp;
    for(std::vector<int>::const_iterator it = array->data.begin(); it != array->data.end(); ++it)
    {   
        tmp.push_back( *it);
    }
    //do sth with tmp ..
    } 

Furthermore check if the input message is not empty, which might occur on the first callbacks as it was in my case. Otherwise Segmentation fault (core dumped) might happen.
