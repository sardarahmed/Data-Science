Q:

transform tolerance

hi, All,
I am getting TF transform error.
my setup is two laser, one SICK LM100 for AMCL. one Hokuyo URG for local cost map.
the move_base Local cost map is dropping packages and complains old data.
Transform [sender=/hokuyo_scan]
For frame [local_laser]: No transform to fixed frame [world]. TF error: [Lookup would require extrapolation into the future. Requested time 1407940054.418783996 but the latest data is at time 1407940054.271341707, when looking up transform from frame [local_laser] to frame [world]]

I found there's a transform_tolerance setting in  costmap_2d package, and I believe it's been set more than enough >1.0s.
the error still persists.
however, when I use either single laser for both purposes, there isn't such problem.
anyone share a light?
thanks.
ray

Does this happen once or all the time?

A:

The transform tolerance parameter in costmap_2d doesn't get used everywhere you'd expect. Try setting the transform tolerance in amcl instead, which post-dates the localization transform, making them valid slightly longer into the future. Just not 1 s, it should only need to be high enough to cover the lag in the system.
