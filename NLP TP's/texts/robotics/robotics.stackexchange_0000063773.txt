Q:

Getting the navigation goal from RVIZ

I am able to get the initial pose of my turtlebot using :
rospy.wait_for_message('initialpose', PoseWithCovarianceStamped)
rospy.Subscriber('initialpose', PoseWithCovarianceStamped)
This allows me to get a the initial pose when a user clicks sets the 2d Pose estimate in RVIZ. My question is threefold

How do I achieve the same with the 2d Navigation Goal (getting it fom RVIZ)?
What message should  I wait for and subscribe to?
What TYPE of message am I looking for? For example with initialpose I get a PoseWithCovarianceStamped message.

A:

rviz publishes goals on the topic /move_base_simple/goal as a geometry_msgs/PoseStamped.

@David thanks got it. Do you know how I can now convert this to a goal coordinate. Im not having any luck

What do you mean by goal coordinate?

Sorry about that. How do I convert the PoseStamped to  MoveBaseGoal() if at all possible?

If you look at http://wiki.ros.org/move_base_msgs you'll see that all MoveBaseGoal contains is a PoseStamped.
