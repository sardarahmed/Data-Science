Q:

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] while running a roslaunch launch file

Basically like the title refers on using this command:
roslaunch a1 a1.launch

This is the appearing the error in terminal :
while processing /opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/gmapping.launch.xml: Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/gmapping.launch.xml' The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Of course I manually looked for the file and found it there in the normal directory, I checked my a1.launch file and my include syntax looks like in order aswel:
include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/gmapping.launch.xml"

It goes without saying that I am a complete amateur in all this, I've shown some interest in a robotics internship and am required to know basics and all.
Thanks in advance!!

A:

The repository shows that the file you are (probably) looking for is at a different path: you are missing a gmapping/ string in the include. So, in your a1.launch file you should change the line you have to:
<include file="$(find turtlebot_navigation)/launch/includes/gmapping/gmapping.launch.xml"/>

Instead of going to the repository online you could also use roscd turtlebot_navigation and find the path to the file you wish to include from your local filesystem.

Does one have to re-compile after adding this (And how do you do that?). I added it but it doesn't seem to recognize the change.
EDIT: Disregard

@ahumay: so did it work for you in the end? If so: what did you change? Or was something else not working?

@gvdhoorn yes, I just rebooted my machine
