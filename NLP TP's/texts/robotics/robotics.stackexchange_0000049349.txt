Q:

kinect calibration- ImportError: No module named cv_bridge

Hi,
UBUNTU 12.04 and FUERTE
I am following the tutorial on calibrating kinect at http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration
I am getting the following error
I have cv_bridge installed and I also rosmake it
sai@sai-HP-EliteBook-8460w:~$ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw camera:=/camera/rgb --size 5x4 --square 0.0245
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/image_pipeline/camera_calibration/nodes/cameracalibrator.py", line 52, in 
from camera_calibration.calibrator import cvmat_iterator, MonoCalibrator, StereoCalibrator, ChessboardInfo
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/image_pipeline/camera_calibration/src/camera_calibration/calibrator.py", line 40, in 
import cv_bridge
ImportError: No module named cv_bridge

Hi Sai, have you checked whether you included the cv_bridge in your manifest.xml?
Comment by sai on 2013-03-14:
yeah it is there

A:

In the last version of CvBridge, some changes have been made. The tutorials on cv_bridge make no difference between includes in electric and Fuerte/Groovy, but there is some.
Thus, instead of
#include <cv_bridge/CvBridge.h>

You should try
#include <cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h>

Or the inverse ^^
As I'm not sure it'll really help, Let me know...

This issue with cv_bridge got solved when I added the path to cv_bridge.py to the python path of environment variables                                                     ....                                   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/vision_opencv/cv_bridge/src/cv_bridge

If the same error occurs with image_geometry, then just remove import image_geometry. For calibrating ASUS replace the /camera/rgb/image_raw with /camera/rgb/image_mono in the rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator................
