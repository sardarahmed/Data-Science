Q:

FastRTPS Topic & ROS2 Topic list

Hi, All.
When using the HelloWorld example of the C++ example in ROS2, it appears in the node list, but not in the topic list.
Of course, when node_demos_cpp is used, it appears in the Topic list.
But I would like to use another DDS topic other than ROS2. (E. G., Using microRTPS, FastRTPS, etc.)
Is there anything I have to do separately?
Does not the topic list of ROS2 fetch the topic list registered in DDS?

A:

Can you please link to the example you are referring to or share the code. Otherwise it is unclear what are a referencing.
Yes, it is supposed to show all ROS 2 specific DDS topics. But it doesn't show all native DDS topics.

Thanks for your answer!

HelloWorld Example

Can you tell me the difference between ROS2 specific DDS topics and native DDS topics?
Are the ROS2 specific DDS topics such as std_msgs in ROS2?

The referenced example is not from ROS 2 but from FastRTPS - it doesn't contain any ROS specific code an won't appear in the ROS topic list. Please see http://design.ros2.org/articles/topic_and_service_names.html how ROS topic names are represented in DDS. Only those are reported by ros2 topic.
