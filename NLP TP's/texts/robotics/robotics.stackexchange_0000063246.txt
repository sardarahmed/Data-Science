Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: tab completion

I am on Ubuntu 12.04 running Hydro and with roscd I can't tab complete. Is there something wrong with my install or is that just not a feature available with the ROS file navigation tools.

A:

roscd should tab-complete ROS package names.
If this isn't working, you should check:

That you're sourcing the setup.bash and not setup.sh in your workspace. (setup.sh is for posix-compliant shells that don't have any fancy features.)
That your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH are set properly (The setup files should do this automatically when you source them, but there's always a possibility that something is overwriting them later)

Yeah, my source is correct: $source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash Not sure what is preventing it... Just strange. Thanks for the quick feedback!

Are you using a shell other than bash?

Note that ahendrix was referring to the setup.bash in your catkin workspace (i.e. "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash"), which is another script than the one you mention (in /opt/ros/). You need to run BOTH scripts (first /opt/ros/... then the one in your catkin workspace) to get it to work.

Thanks guys! That makes a lot of sense.
