A:

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-sicktoolbox-wrapper

and your done.
Note: rosdep install installs the dependencies of a package, NOT the package itself.

I used sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-sicktoolbox-wrapper, the package got installed properly.
However running rosdep install sticktoolbox_wrapper still gives me an error. And if rosdep installs only the dependencies of the package then how do i download the package , by the apt-get ?
