A:

You can use stereo_image_proc to create point cloud. (http://wiki.ros.org/stereo_image_proc)
It will also publish rectified image topics which allow you to use rtabmap_ros to create a map. (http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros)
Not sure it is what you are looking for (maybe there is also other packages to do that).
