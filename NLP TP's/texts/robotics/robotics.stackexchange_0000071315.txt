Q:

Opening A .URDF in Gazebo

I created a .URDF from SolidWorks using SW2URDF plug in, but the model doesn't appear in the insert model list in GAZEBO, even after i paste relevant files in .Gazebo folder. I know its basic stuff but please help. How do I open my model in GAZEBO after creating a URDF from SOLIDWORKS.
Thankyou.

A:

There is a tutorial here to open an urdf in Gazebo. (I don't know if you can have the urdf model in the gazebo list model)
You have two ways to do that :

Command line
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file rospack find MYROBOT_description/urdf/MYROBOT.urdf -urdf -x 0 -y 0 -z 1 -model MYROBOT (you must create a ros package)

Launch file

This node to start gazebo :
<launch>
    <!-- We resume the logic in empty_world.launch, changing only the name of the world to be launched -->
    <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
      <arg name="paused" value="false"/>
      <arg name="use_sim_time" value="true"/>
      <arg name="gui" value="true"/>
      <arg name="headless" value="false"/>
      <arg name="debug" value="false"/>
    </include>
</launch>

This node to spawn a model :
<node name="spawn_urdf" pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" args="-file $(find baxter_description)/urdf/baxter.urdf -urdf -z 1 -model baxter" />
