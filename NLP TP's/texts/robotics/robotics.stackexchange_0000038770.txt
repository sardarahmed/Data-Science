Q:

Questions regarding usb cameras

Hi,
I'm new to ROS as well as to linux and has been trying to get the usb camera to work.
I've followed the tutorials from:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
and
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/StackInstallation
and
http://www.iheartrobotics.com/2010/05/vision-for-robots-1-of-n-setup.html
but I'm still unable to install it properly. When i try to enter the command
$rosmake --rosdep-install
I get the error "No package or stack specified.  And current directory 'usb_cam' is not a package name or stack name."
Can someone help me? thanks in advance!

A:

If you can deal with the code being GPL, you may want to try using this driver

The tutorials will be updated after Fuerte is released hopefully.

The only caveat is the USB camera has to support USB Video Class (UVC). It seems a lot of them do, but not everything ... for example the camera in my MacBook.
Comment by Ken on 2012-03-18:
uvc_camera uses video4linux, so it should work with most of the non-UVC cameras that v4l supports. Support for non-UVC cameras is probably going to be moved into a separate node when uvc_camera is replaced with a cross-platform, UVC-only version.

Ah ... I am confused. I was referring to libuvc_ros (which does work on my macbook, just not with the built in camera) and got confused with uvc_camera (which I guess uses v4l).
