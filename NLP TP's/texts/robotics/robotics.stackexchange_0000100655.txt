Q:

Sending my own path to ROS Navigation stack, Where can I locate the 'internal' nav_msgs/Path in the code?

Does anyone know where I can find this 'internal' nav_msgs/Path in the code of the ROS Navigation stack?
Is it move_base.cpp? navfn_node.cpp? trajectory_planner_ros.cpp?

A:

This is much easier in Nav2's distributed server design https://navigation.ros.org/. You can easily inject your paths rather than using the path planning algorithms if you like.
