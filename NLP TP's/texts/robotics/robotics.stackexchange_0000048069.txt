Q:

How can i use my own rosbag version

Hi,
I need to be able to set the duration for a rosbag play command.
This feature is not implemented in rosbag yet, there is a pull request though.
Since I need this feature now I would either have to stop the rosbag play process at an given time or I would have to implement it in my own rosbag branch. When I am using my own rosbag branch I will also have to install this custom branch on other computers which will use my package.
Is there a nice way to do any of this?

A:

You can checkout the rosbag package into a catkin workspace, make arbitrary changes to it and than build the workspace with "catkin_make". After that you source the setup.bash from that workspace instead of /opt/ros/groovy and your version of rosbag overlays the installed one.
This is how you can override any catkin package in ROS.
