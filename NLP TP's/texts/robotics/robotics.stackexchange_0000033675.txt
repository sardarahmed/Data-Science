Q:

People Detection Algorithm

Is it possible to modify the people detection algorithm that openni_kinect uses? I am currently making the kinect save the calibration data and load it immediately when it finds a "person". However, it detects many things that are not people and do not look like people, such as poles and tables. Is the people detection part of the code completely closed source, or can I access it?

A:

The NITE software for people detection is proprietary; PrimeSense has not released its source code, although the device driver and OpenNI middleware layer are fully open source.
