Q:

Rosbridge PNG decompression in Obj-C/C++

I use rosbridge/websocket for an iOS project. I want to use the PNG compression option for image transfers but cannot figure out how to implement this "hack" of decompressing the PNG data in Objective C (C++ should also be ok) .
Is there any alternative compression method in rosbridge e.g. gzip?
If not, how would you go about implementing the PNG decompression in Objective C (or perhaps C++)?

A:

If you have opencv (it's ported to iOS) you can use cv::imdecode (http://docs.opencv.org/modules/highgui/doc/reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html?highlight=imencode#imdecode). It works same like cv::imread for reading+decoding png/jpg etc. data from files with the difference  takes not a file but a  binary buffer e. g. std::vector<uchar>  as input for decoding...
