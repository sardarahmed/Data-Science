Q:

How to get sensor_msgs dependency with catkin (fuerte)

After upgrading to fuerte, the ros command "rospack depends sensor_msgs" is empty.
I have seen, that in fuerte some packages have changed the buildchain to catkin.
But how is it possible to get the dependency of this package with catkin? For example it depends of "geometry_msgs".

This happens on Oneiric, as well.

A:

This is a bug that should be fixed in upcoming Debian packages. See this ticket.
Edit: Fixed in current Debian packages.
