Q:

Planning sequence of motion using arm_navigation/moveit

Hi,
I would like to planning sequence of motion with planning_component_visualizer. In the menu handler, there are only the option: set start and set end position.I would like to add option: "set next motion" which will swap the current end_state_ to a new start_state_ and selectmarker from the new start_state_ to set new goal. But I don't know how to set new start_state_ to "current" end_state_ (which is KinematicState), therefore, the start_state_ also changes when I start move the marker to the new end_state.
Is there any way to get the current KinematicState?

A:

Problem is solved:
vector< double > state_vector;
gc.end_state_->getKinematicStateValues(state_vector);
gc.start_state_->setKinematicState(state_vector);
