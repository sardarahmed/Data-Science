Q:

Camera Pose Calibration

Is there an equivalent package to camera pose calibration in ROS Hydro? Finding the exact transform connecting the frame of a new camera to an existing robot's tf tree is almost impossible ...

A:

Similar packages are industrial_extrinsic_cal for ROS Hydro, and camera_pose_calibration for ROS Indigo.

These aren't maintained anymore, and they're not even well documented.
