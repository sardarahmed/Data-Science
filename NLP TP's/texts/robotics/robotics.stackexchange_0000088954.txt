Q:

Is pluginlib working on ROS2?

I've been fighting to port over some plugins to ROS2, and everything builds fine, but the plugins aren't discovered at runtime. Before I dig into this further, I'm wondering if this is expected to be working, and if so, is there any description of the changes between ROS 1 and ROS2?
Also are there any command line tools under ROS 2 for debugging? For example, in ROS1 there is rospack plugins --attrib=plugin

A:

rviz is using pluginlib in ROS 2 right now, so maybe you could use it as a reference.

Also are there any command line tools under ROS 2 for debugging? For example, in ROS1 there is rospack plugins --attrib=plugin

Not right now. That would be a nice enhancement though :)
There's some small documentation here:

Not that I'll have time to do it for quite a while, but where is the right place to add the rospack functionality? Does it belong as part of the ros2 pkg command?

Yeah, probably so. There might be room for a ros2 pluginlib type verb separately, but I'd have to think about that more. I always found the --attrib=plugin to be unnecessarily obtuse.
