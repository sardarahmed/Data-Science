Q:

Write a Plugin. Should I know clearly about the function defined by gazebo if I want to write a plugin by myself?

I read about the tutorial of Write a Plugin. I don't understand the functions listed by the tutorial. Do you think I should learn about the header files first?

A:

Gazebo's API is quite extensive, so it's probably not viable to "learn" all the functions. Depending on your use case, only a fraction of the functions will be relevant. For example, if you want to apply forces and velocities to parts of your robot, you'd need some functions from gazebo::physics::Link API. To tune a camera sensor, you'd look at gazebo::sensors::CameraSensor and so on.
Instead of going through the API, I suggest you search for keywords related to the problem you're trying to solve and go through some related tutorials and examples first. This way, you naturally start becoming familiar with the functions.
