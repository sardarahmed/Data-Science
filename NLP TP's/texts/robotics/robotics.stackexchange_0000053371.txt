Q:

Using ICP inspectors in ethzasl_icp_mapper package

Hi,
I have been using the package ethzasl_icp_mapper to build 3D maps.
Now I would like to use the inspector provided in the package.  But when I enable the PerformanceInspector in the icp.yaml file like this:
readingDataPointsFilters:
  - RandomSamplingDataPointsFilter:
      prob: 0.2

matcher:
  KDTreeMatcher:
    maxDist: 0.3
    epsilon: 3.16

outlierFilters:
  - TrimmedDistOutlierFilter:
      ratio: 0.75

errorMinimizer:
  PointToPlaneErrorMinimizer

transformationCheckers:
  - DifferentialTransformationChecker:
      minDiffRotErr: 0.001
      minDiffTransErr: 0.01
      smoothLength: 4
  - CounterTransformationChecker:
      maxIterationCount: 40
  - BoundTransformationChecker:
      maxRotationNorm: 0.8
      maxTranslationNorm: 0.4

inspector:
#  VTKFileInspector
#  NullInspector
   PerformanceInspector:
      baseFileName: matcher-output
#      dumpPerfOnExit: 1

I get the error saying:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'PointMatcherSupport::Parametrizable::InvalidParameter'
 what(): Parameter baseFileName for module PerformanceInspector was set but is not used

Then the roslaunch exits.
When I enable the VTKInspector it works and the terminal shows the message that it is writing the data to some files which begin with baseFileName: point-matcher-output
but I am not able to find out the location of these file written.
Regards
