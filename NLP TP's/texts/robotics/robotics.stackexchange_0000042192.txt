Q:

question about manipulation of gazebo gui

Hello, I have a simple question about the manipulation of gazebo gui: How could I make the view in the gazebo follow the model? Now the view seems to only focus on the center point of the simulated plate when gazebo starts. Also I have the similar problem with changing the view in rviz. It seems that I can only change the view according to certain point, and I can not freely change it. I use fuerte on ubuntu 12.04.
Thanks in advance, Mike.

A:

I would think you'd need a world plug-in. Have you checked out the www.gazebosim.org site? Maybe the 'Rendering' section in the api will have what you're looking for.
