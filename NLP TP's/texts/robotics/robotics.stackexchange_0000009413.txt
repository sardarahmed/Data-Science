Q:

RRT algorithm in C++

I want to implement RRT for motion planning of a robotic arm. I searched a lot on the internet to get some sample code of RRT for motion planning, but I didn't get any. Can someone please suggest a good source where I can find RRT implemented in C++ for any type of motion planning.

A:

The OMPL library has some good quality implementations of several sampling-based motion planners, as listed here :

In particular, you can find several variants of RRT under the BSD license.
