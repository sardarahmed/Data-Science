Q:

How do I build everything?

There's no Makefile in the root of ros-pkg!

A:

ROS packages live in a federated space where's there's no central list of things to be built. For reasons of (disk) space and time, usually you just want to build the things that you're working with. E.g., if you're using the pr2_2dnav_gazebo package, which brings up a navigation stack in simulation, you can build all the pieces you need with rosmake:
rosmake pr2_2dnav_gazebo

Having said that, if you really want to build everything, you can use rosmakeall:
rosmakeall

It will build all packages in your ROS_ROOT and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH directories. Note that this will take about 90 minutes and consume about 1GB on disk. As of now, rosmakeall also runs all the tests for each package. It will eventually be modified to not run tests.
