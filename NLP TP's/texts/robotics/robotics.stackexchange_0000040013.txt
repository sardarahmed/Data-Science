Q:

Linking error libboost_system with tabletop_object_detector

Hey,
I decided to upgrade my laptop to Oneiric today and after fixing quite a few new issues, I'm stuck on an issue I can't seem to get fixed. When rosmaking tabletop_object_detector I get the following error :
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/tabletop_object_recognition.dir/src/tabletop_object_recognition.o: undefined reference to symbol 'boost::system::system_category()'
/usr/bin/ld: note: 'boost::system::system_category()' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.46.1 so try adding it to the linker command line
/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.46.1: could not read symbols: Invalid operation

I tried various things, from reinstalling libboost1.46-all-dev to making with --pre-clean, nothing seemed to have helped.
Can anyone help me out with this probably minor issue?
ps. I'm still running ROS Electric.

A:

I (hack)fixed it for now by adding -lboost_system to the target_link_libraries for tabletop_object_recognition, but it still beats me why this started to give errors now ...

I fixed it by adding set(CXX_FLAGS "-lboost_system") to CMakeLists.txt on Ubuntu 11.10
