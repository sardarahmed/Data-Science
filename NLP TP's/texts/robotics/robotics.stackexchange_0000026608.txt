Q:

Cannot find gazebo_ros plugins after update from 1.9.4 to 1.9.5

I just updated gazebo-prerelease through ubuntu(12.04) update manager from 1.9.4 to 1.9.5 and now gazebo cannot find the gasebo_ros plugins which were working well till now.

Error [Plugin.hh:127] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_gpu_laser.so: libsdf.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Error [Plugin.hh:127] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so: libsdf.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

These were the only plugins I was using for you. I did a search for the plugins and found them in the ros simulator_gazebo stack for some reason. Adding them, to GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH doesnt solve the issue either. 
ROS: Groovy

A:

Try using the main gazebo debian (which is currently 1.9.0). This should work with gazebo_ros.

Works! with main debian. Had to install the gazebo_ros_pkgs from source once more to make it run. Thank you

Hi,
I quess It all runs with the source install again if you update and rebuild gazebo_ros_pkgs too.
libsdf.so has been replaced with libsdformat.so in the newest releases.
