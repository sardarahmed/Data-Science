Q:

Removing part of a published topics path

Say if im publishing diagnostic messages from a node using this;
nh.advertise<diagnostic_msgs::DiagnosticArray>("diagnostics", 10);

In the case its from our IMU node, making the topic its publishing called /imu/diagnostics. Is there a way to remove the /imu prefix so that the aggregator doesn't get confused? Or should I be running diagnostics from a separate node or something?
Thanks for any help.

A:

I found my own solution.
When defining a publisher, if you're trying to publish to the top level you must add a '/' to the front of the path. For example;
nh.advertise<diagnostic_msgs::DiagnosticArray>("/diagnostics", 10);

publishes to the topic;
/diagnostics

While
nh.advertise<diagnostic_msgs::DiagnosticArray>("diagnostics", 10);

publishes to the
node_name/diagnostics

You're right, the wiki Names explains it with more details if you want.
