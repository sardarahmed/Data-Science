Q:

Kinematics and dynamics analysis of manipulator in zero gravity

Is there any change in the analysis of kinematic and dynamic analysis of the manipulator which is working in zero gravity or microgravity?

A:

Kinematics is based on geometry and joint constraints, so no change there at all. 
Dynamic motion results from the sum of forces, so the only change to a dynamic analysis is that you don't include gravity, but all other forces would remain.
