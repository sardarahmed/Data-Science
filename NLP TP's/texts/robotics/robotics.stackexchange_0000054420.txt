Q:

problem creating a new package with catkin_create_pkg

I'm trying to create a new package in my workspace with catkin_create_pkg and I get this error:
afgonzalez@afgonzalez-desktop:~/ros_workspace/src$ catkin_create_pkg 
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/catkin_create_pkg", line 10, in <module>
  from catkin_pkg.package_templates import create_package_files, PackageTemplate
  
  ImportError: No module named catkin_pkg.package_templates</div>

I have reinstalled ros-groovy-catkin and python-catkin-pkg package but the error still there.

Please post the version number of your catkin_pkg package: python -c "import catkin_pkg; print(catkin_pkg.version)"
Comment by ane_fernandez on 2013-09-29:
The version of the catkin_pkg is 0.1.20
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-09-30:
Please get the folder where catkin_pkg is in your installation ( python -c "import catkin_pkg; print(catkin_pkg.file)" ) and post the directory content.
Comment by ane_fernandez on 2013-09-30:
The directory content is: /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/catkin_pkg/init.pyc
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-10-01:
That is pretty incomplete. Please remove remove the file and reinstall the Debian package python-catkin-pkg again.
Comment by ane_fernandez on 2013-10-02:
I have deleted init.pyc file and reinstalled  the python-catkin-pkg and the templates aren't found yet. The content directory is still the same: /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/catkin_pkg/init.pyc

A:

Looks like you have an out-of-date caktin_pkg, but since you said that you have updated recently I would guess that you're using Ubuntu and had catkin_pkg installed from pip at some point.

I have followed the instructions of the link but the error is still there.
Comment by William on 2013-09-30:
That's odd, the only way this can occur is if you don't have catkin_pkg installed or you have an older version installed which is overriding the updated one (which is commonly the case with pip and apt-get). Which is what @Dirk Thomas is getting at in his above comments.
