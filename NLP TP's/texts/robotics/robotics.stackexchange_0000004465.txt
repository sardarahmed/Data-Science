Q:

What's the difference between Yaw and Attitude in Quad Rotor

I have a big miss conception between Yaw and attitude ? 
Isn't both represent "how far is the quad from earth ?" 
Also if you could post how to calculate them from IMU (gyro +accele + magent ) 

A:

I think you're confusing two words that are spelled almost identically:
Altitude:  (with an L) is the distance from the vehicle to the earth.  It is given in terms of meters.
Attitude:  (with a T) refers to the orientation of the vehicle with respect to a reference frame.  It is usually given in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw, which are all essentially angles of rotation along the x, y, or z axis.
