Q:

calculation sequences when using RPY-transformation vs Euler-transformation

I have trouble understanding calculation sequences for RPY-transformation and Euler-transformation.
Let's assume that there are 3 (rotation/translation) instructions.
I will notate transformation matrix for instruction 1 as [1],
transformation matrix for instruction 2 as [2],
transformation matrix for instruction 3 as [3]
In this situation when using RPY-method, calculation order will be [3][2][1] -> [3][2 * 1] -> [3 * 2 * 1].
First multiply [2] and [1], and then multiply [3]. Right?
When using Euler-method, I am not sure what is correct order.

[1][2][3] -> [1 * 2][3] -> [1 * 2 * 3]
First multiply [1] and [2], and then multiply [3]
[3][2][1] -> [3 * 2][1] -> [3 * 2 * 1]
First multiply [3] and [2], and then multiply [1]

What is correct sequence when calculation Euler-method? Is it 1) or 2) ?
Also I think the resulting 4x4 matrix should be same whether I use RPY or Euler transformation. Is it correct?

A:

I would like to add to your answer a simple concept i used to understand rotation matrices.
So, first you rotate the x- axis. No problem here.R=[x]
Second, you rotate the already rotated axes(that was rotated around x) around z.
Hence you pre-multiply first matrix by second matrix as it is now changing the previous rotation.
Post multiplying here would mean that the frame was rotated around x now affected the rotation around z which is not true. Hence pre-multiplication. Rot. matrix becomes R'=[z][x].
Now, third you rotate already rotated axes (that was rotated first around x and then around z) around y. As your rotation around y affects the previously rotates axes, so you pre-multiply them with y- rotation matrix. Post multiplying would mean that rotation around x and z affects the rotation around y which is not true as frames were rotated around y in the end (not first). New matrix R"=[y][z][x].
So any new rotation around reference frames affects all rotations done before so should be placed first. The first rotated matrix doesn't affect anyone but themselves should be placed last.
I hope that makes sense.
