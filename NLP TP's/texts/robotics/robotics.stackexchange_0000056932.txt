Q:

Issues launching nao_sim

Hi Guys,
I am currently on a mission to recreate 3d navigation functionality described in the paper "Real-Time Navigation in 3D Environments Based on Depth Camera Data" by Armin Hornung et. el.
I have gone through the process of installing and validating the ROS install (Hydro), and am now trying to just get the following command to work:

roslaunch nao_bringup nao_sim.launch

When I launch the command I get the following error:

I have validated that the required packages are installed using rosdeps and roscd.
I am on ubuntu precise64, ROS hydro and pynaoqi-python-2.7-naoqi-1.14-linux64.
Any help would be appreciated!

What happens if you just start a single node, e.g. "rosrun nao_driver nao_sensors.py"? (start a roscore in a separate terminal before, as well as NaoQI)
Comment by Quinton Anderson on 2014-02-18:
I have only tried for 30 minutes, but at this stage that command simply exits without any real output, besides: No handlers could be found for logger "rosout"
I have checked the logs, they are also empty. I will continue some more tomorrow.
Comment by dnth on 2014-02-20:
have you sourced your workspace? Like the command below
source /devel/setup.bash
Comment by Quinton Anderson on 2014-02-20:
yes, I have sourced ./devel/setup.bash

Hi! I have the same poblems, No handlers could be found for logger rosout. My configuration system is similar (ubuntu 12.04 64, ROS hydro and pynaoqi 1.14.5) for the Installation of ROS for NAO I followed the Armin's tutorials "ROS on a remote PC" but I installed just the precompiled binaries. should I uninstall them and install the github ones? including the extras_nao? Quinton Anderson, did you solve the problem? thank you!

Hi, I didn't get it working, but I haven't tried very hard yet. I have been distracted at work. I will get back to focussing on it shortly.
Comment by PabloM on 2014-03-21:
Quinton, our problem is the linking with the pynaoqi (export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/path/to/pynaoqi/") in my case i have an error in the path to pynaoqi. now I have other problem when i launch the NAOnodes (ERROR: cannot launch node of type [nao_driver/nao_sensors_cpp]: can't locate node [nao_sensors_cpp] in package [nao_driver]) .

Comment by PabloM on 2014-03-21:
Armin, thank you for your advice, right now I'm able to launch the python nodes with the same instruction that you suggested in the above question ( roslaunch nao_driver nao_driver.launch force_python:=true nao_ip:=192.168.1.206) without any error and i tested a simple forward motion of the Nao.
Comment by ROSwithNao on 2014-06-05:
I am having the same problem. I get the "No handlers could be found for logger "rosout" " error message when I try "roslaunch nao_bringup nao_sim.launch" as well as when I tried "rosrun nao_driver nao_sensors.py". Was this problem ever resolved?

A:

@PabloM That is a different problem, you try to launch the C++ nodes. They require that you compile them for the robot (with the C++ SDK). You should try launching the Python nodes instead.
