Q:

colcon build package blacklist

I am trying to build a ros2 workspace with colcon.
How I can blacklist packages?
I am looking for the catkin-equivalent to:
catkin config --blacklist baz

--- updated information --
I tried unsuccessfully the following:
$ colcon build --packages-skip mypackage

usage: colcon [-h] [--log-base LOG_BASE] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL] {build,test,test-result} ...
colcon: error: unrecognized arguments: --packages-skip mypackage

also tried unsuccessfully:
$ colcon build --packages-ignore mypackage

usage: colcon [-h] [--log-base LOG_BASE] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL] {build,test,test-result} ...
colcon: error: unrecognized arguments: --packages-ignore mypackage

Do you have the Debian package python3-colcon-package-selection or the Python package colcon-package-selection installed?

Nopes. That was the issue. Thank you.

A:

There's --packages-skip baz which might serve your purposes. See the docs for lots more including and excluding options.

--packages-ignore could also be an option: see https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/discovery-arguments.html
