Q:

Global and Local costmap configuration

Hi,
I am new  to ROS and was reading about the global and local costmap configuration here http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup.
I noticed that the static map parameter is set to true in global_costmap configuration while it is set to false in the local costmap configuration. Can somebody explain this to me ?
