Q:

Issues of gazebo 2.0 used with ros-hydro

Hi, I have just upgraded to gazebo 2.0, I use ros-hydro and ubuntu 12.04 32bit. It seems that the new gazebo is not compatible with ros, as when I start the gazebo with ros: roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch, I get the following error messages:
Error [Plugin.hh:141] Failed to load plugin /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libgazebo_ros_paths_plugin.so: libgazebo_common.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Error [Plugin.hh:141] Failed to load plugin /opt/ros/hydro/lib/libgazebo_ros_api_plugin.so: libgazebo_common.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Then there is no service provided by gazebo to spawn model using urdf, which is waited by the ros-gazebo interface programm spawn_model. Someone else also encounters the same problem: http://answers.ros.org/question/88826/plorblem-in-loading-gazebo-in-ros/
Thanks for any help!

Seems to me like it is exactly the same problem described in the answer 88826 as you well pointed out. Let's follow things in that answer and close this one.

Let me ask you another question: how did you install gazebo and ros-hydro-gazebo-pkgs? From debs? From source? Thanks.

Thanks for your reply! That question(88826) has been unfortunately closed by the manager of the ros forum, probably as it is a gazebo topic. I install both gazebo and ros-hydro-gazebo-pkgs from debs.

Ouch you are right, much a better place this. It's weird that you could install gazebo-2.0.0 and ros-hydro-gazebo-pkgs at the same time since gazebo-2.0.0 conflicts with < 2.3.3 version of these packages. 2.3.3 new versions should be available very soon and probably will solve the problem for you.

A:

The integration document about Gazebo/ROS should help to solve all problems related to the gazebo 2.0 (gazebo_current) release and the integration with ROS.

Could we mark this answer as solved, clicking that check button? That way I don't see it as "unanswered" any more. Thanks.
