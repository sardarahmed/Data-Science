Q:

when will Python 3 become the ROS standard

I understand that someone has decided to discontinue support for python 2 by 2020. Are there any plans to move rospy to use the python3 interpreter by default?

A:

For ROS 1, it's not clear when Python 3 will be the default. You can read the discussion on Melodic target platforms here: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/139
"ROS 2 supports Python 3 only." https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Migration-Guide

Thanks for that info! The fact that ROS doesn't support Python 3 in 2018 is honestly absolutely ridiculous.
