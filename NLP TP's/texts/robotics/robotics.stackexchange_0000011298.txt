Q:

Self balancing robot control system strategies

I’m in the early stages of designing a self-balancing robot as a way to refresh my knowledge on control theory, which has been gradually slipping away since graduating about a year and a half ago. I'm wondering if anyone has any input on how best to approach this problem.
My plan is to use a 6 DOF IMU as an angle sensor, and to control the pitch by accelerating and decelerating the cart. I'm looking for robust response to disturbance, and to add in RC differential drive capabilities later on. This block diagram is a pretty close match for what I was planning to do,  (source: Sebastian Nilsson's Blog):

Would this be a good approach? Any recommended alternatives? Thanks.

A:

I can recommend an alternative which has worked for me quite well.
I derived the dynamical model of a inverted pendulum, then linearised it around the stable operating point. With this simplified model I found the LQR controller which keeps my robot upright and tracks my desired linear and angular velocities.
