Q:

Can I build nodes in packages separately?

Can I build nodes in packages separately and use own CMakeLists for them?
One of my nodes can't use C++ 11, but other depends on it. Also I want to separate them to git-submodules.

A:

You should be able to write your CMakeLists so as to compile some nodes with C++11 and some without. It will require a little bit of CMake logic.
