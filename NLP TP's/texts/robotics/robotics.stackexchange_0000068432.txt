Q:

Are there any limitations to using ROS in VirtualBox Ubuntu?

I installed Ubuntu 14.04.2 on VirtualBox on Mac OS X Yosemite and I then installed ROS Indigo on Ubuntu.
I am wondering if there are any features of ROS that this setup does not allow, such as connecting to hardware like sensors or actuators.
Thank you.

A:

Well, maybe you could have problems with USB devices (USB 3.0). I just know that USB 2.0 devices are supported only by this plugin. But maybe USB 3.0 is supported as well, but you would have to check for that and I am in doubt that you need USB3. Most kind of stuff I guess will work, even serial interfaces can be bound to the virtual machine.
I have used it multiple times to simulate multi machine setups on one computer. I did not experience any problem so far.
