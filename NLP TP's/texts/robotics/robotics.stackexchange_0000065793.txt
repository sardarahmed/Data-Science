Q:

About publishing via terminal (turtlebot)

Hello, I was trying to move the turtlebot via terminal and my surprise was that this instruction is not moving the robot
$ rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  '{linear:  {x: 0.1, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 0.0}}'

Before using this instrucction I used:

$ roscore 
>
>  $ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

So I think that maybe its a good idea try to use the name of the turtlebot before /cmd_vel but there is no turtlebot_node on the list of obtained using rosnode.
(with the teleop key works fine)
What can I do?
Thanks beforehand!
