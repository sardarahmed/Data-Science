did you delete the build and devel folders after removing these files? You should delete them in order to do a clean catkin_make.
Comment by Abdu on 2017-05-22:
yes i already did, thx

A:

This error message tells you that the ROS Package diagnostic_updater is missing.
There can be some reasons for that:

Is your workspace sourced correctly?
Is your ROS Distro sourced correctly?
When you compile it from source are your dependencies set correctly?

If its even not installed I think you just can
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-diagnostics

Than the package which is missing is installed.

thx to ur reply, it works now, the problem was that I wanted to fee up some space in ubuntu, I have used bleachbit, then it seems I removed some important files. Finally, I was trying this code in terminal [sudo apt-get install ros_kinetic_diagnostics], but it doesn't work, then I used yours, thx
