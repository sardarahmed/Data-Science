Q:

Can Textures be added to simple objects from my own source?

If I build a simple object such as a cylinder or a box I can add texture from the gazebo.material file e.g.:
     <script>
        <uri>file://media/materials/scripts/gazebo.material</uri>
        <name>Gazebo/CeilingTiled</name>
      </script>

And this is matched with the block from the gazebo.material file:
material Gazebo/CeilingTiled
{
receive_shadows on
technique
{
pass
{
ambient 0.5 0.5 0.5 1.000000
  texture_unit
  {
    texture ceiling_tiled.jpg
  }
}

}
}
... and then I can get a nice textured and properly lit object in Gazebo.
But this seems to be limited to just the materials in this particular file - about 20 of them. How can I specify my own .material file to map my own texture onto the object model?

A:

So there's two ways (that I know of) that you can do this:

Within the model directory: create a materials/scripts and materials/textures directory in the directory of the corresponding model and put the texture into materials/textures and the corresponding *.material into materials/scripts ... have a look at your very own brick_box_3x1x3 for example. ;)

If you want to specify materials that can be used by multiple models you can create a folder "media" that, again, contains "materials/scripts" and "materials/textures" as sub-directories and then add the directory that your "media" directory is part of to your GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH. So for example with the default setup you have a "/usr/local/share/gazebo-1.4/media" directory (compiled from source, debian package installation would be in /usr/share/...) and "/usr/local/share/gazebo-1.4" is in the GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH. To add your own materials you simply create a "<my_package>/media/materials/" directory with the desired scripts and textures and add "<my_package>" to the GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH.
