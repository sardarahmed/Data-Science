Q:

How to build rtabmap_ros with octomap?

Hi,
This guide says that the topics pertaining to octomap like octomap_full, octomap_binary, etc. are only available with I have rtabmap_ros build with octomap. How exactly am I supposed to do this? In the documentation of rtabmap_ros I could not find a way to build it from soruce with octomap.
Can anyone help me if I am missing anything?
Thanks and cheers!

A:

The binaries are already built with octomap. If you build from source, jsut make sure ros-$ROS_DISTRO-octomap-ros is installed, then cmake/catkin will find it.
