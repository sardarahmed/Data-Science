Q:

PCL and ros::Time

Hi,
I was looking through this example and..
http://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros
PointCloud::Ptr msg (new PointCloud);
msg->header.stamp = ros::Time::now ();
The second line where the stamp takes the time from the ros::time function does not work. Is there any reason to it or a workaround to directly use the current time?
Basically the compilation error is as follows:
error: cannot convert ‘ros::Time’ to ‘uint64_t {aka long long unsigned int}’ in assignment
Running hydro btw. Thanks!

A:

ros::Time time_st = ros::Time::now ();
msg->header.stamp = time_st.toNSec()/1e3;
From what I saw in the pcl_conversion header. for hydro there is no toPCL for time but for indigo there is.
Probably the wiki should be updated since hydro is using the newer PCL.
