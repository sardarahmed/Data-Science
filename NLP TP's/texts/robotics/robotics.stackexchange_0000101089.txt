Q:

unable to install catkin on noetic, ubuntu 20.04 with kubuntu

Suposing that catkin was automatically installed with noetic, when I used catkin_make, the command was not found. I tried to install catkin but I received :
The following packages have unset dependencies:
    catkin: Depends: python3-catkin-pkg (>= 0.4.14-2)but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

The package python3-catkin-pkg (0.4.24-100) is really installed.
What can I do?

Pls make sure not to forget to source.

I did not forget to source.
I also had used the same repositories as in question 3417.and that was the result.
Comment by AlessioParmeggiani on 2022-01-25:
Have you tried installing python catkin tools?
sudo apt install python3-catkin-tools

Comment by MiguelMTS on 2022-01-25:
Yes, I did too, and finally arrived to the impossibility aforementioned.
I have repeated the process from the beginning several times and in different ways and always gat the same final result.
Comment by osilva on 2022-01-25:
It could be a Kubuntu issue not necessarily ROS. Ubuntu is the recommended OS
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2022-01-25:
What is the output of:

lsb_release -a
dpkg -l | grep catkin
after sourceing: which catkin_make

And what does:

I did not forget to source

mean exactly?
Unless you've setup to auto-source (via your .bashrc fi), you'll have to source in every terminal manually. A single time won't work for future terminals.

Edit, just noticed:

I tried to install catkin [..]

how? Which command did you use, exactly?
Note that catkin is not the same package as python3-catkin-pkg.
And the latter is not the package which provides the catkin_make command. That would be ros-noetic-catkin. Are you perhaps mixing in wiki/UpstreamPackages?
Comment by MiguelMTS on 2022-01-25:
Yes, I included source via .bashrc.
I  used ros-noetic-catkin
The result for dpkg is:
      ii              python3-catkin               0.8.0-1ubuntu2                 all
      ii              python3-catkin-pkg        0.4.16-1                            all

Comment by MiguelMTS on 2022-01-26:
Sorry.
1.-Before installing noetic
From lsb_release -a, I receive:
NoLSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
Release:         20.04
Codename:     focal 

But now the situation has changed
I am installing on RaspberryPi 4.
Ubuntu 20.04.3 Server LTS (desktop versi√≥n is not available)
With the apt update after the curl command, there appears an error when getting
http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu foval InRelease
   The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:   NO_PUBKEY F42ED6FBAB17C654

Then I tried with gpg --fetch-keys https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc
That imported the key for 'Open Robotics <info@osrfoundation.org>"
But again Received the same error after apt update.:
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2022-01-26:\

I am installing on RaspberryPi 4

this is the first time you mention this.
In the future, please provide pertinent details like this, as otherwise it will be very difficult for people here to help you.

there appears an error when getting http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu foval InRelease

is foval a typo? Or did you copy-paste it?
The correct codename for your distribution would be focal (note: c, not v).
Comment by MiguelMTS on 2022-01-26:
Sorry. It was a typo error in the comment. Of course the message says focal, not foval.
And sorry again, I missed to mention the Raspberry in my first entry.

A:

Thank you all for your help.
Finally I got everything installed correctly.
Bu I don't know yet where was the failure.
For sure, as  I had included the source into the .bashrc file as a first step, in my first reboot it didn't recognized the path of the source because ths noetic directory did not exist yet. From so on, that source was not registered.
Thank you very much indeed and I apologize the time you have dedicated.
