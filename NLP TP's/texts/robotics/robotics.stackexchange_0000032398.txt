Q:

Error in building a Package (ppl_detection)

Hey,
I was trying to install this package from source :
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ppl_detection
I cannot build the package. Apparently, there is some dependency error. It says,
[rospack] couldn't find dependency [pcl_visualization] of [ppl_detection]
What can I do to resolve this issue? Thanks in advance

A:

Hi,
It is complaining about a missing dependency in your package.
It needs the package "pcl_visualization"
You might want to confirm if you do not have the package "pcl_visualization".
 roscd pcl_visualization 
If you cannot find it, you would have to obtain it from this source

More specifically, "sudo apt-get install ros-electric-perception_pcl_addons" should solve the issue (if you're on electric).

Thanks. I had tried that out. I went back to ubuntu 10.10 from 11.04. That solved the problem.
