Q:

Remapping IMU data in launch file

Hello there!
I am very new to ROS so forgive me if that's too easy question. I was trying to find some information on this forum and on ros wiki but couldn't find any.
I want to use hector_slam for my mapping project and right now I am experimenting with IMU data and hector_imu_attitude_to_tf . What I am trying to achieve now is to transform my IMU data to tf. My understanding is that in order to do that I need to publish my IMU data on imu_topic.
For experimenting with those ideas I downloaded some bag file with IMU data and created the following simple launch file:

/auk/fcu/imu is the IMU topic on which my bag file publishes. After launching the file rostopic list command lists imu_topic but unfortunately nothing is being published to that topic. The same is with /tf topic. After running roswtf I got the following message:

WARNING The following node
subscriptions are unconnected:  *
/imu_attitude_to_tf_node:    *
/imu_topic

Should my /imu_topic point to the same data as /auk/fcu/imu ? I would be grateful for any tips about what I might be doing wrong.
I don't know if it's relevant but I am using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.

A:

Here your node expects data on imu_topic but its available on auk/fcu/imu
<remap from="imu_topic" to="auk/fcu/imu"/> 

OR
you can change topic while playing your bag file like
rosbag play bag_file.bag /auk/fcu/imu:=/imu_topic

Thank you for your suggestion! Unfortunately changing launch file as you suggested didn't work for me. Does it matter in which node do I try to remap? Luckily changing topic in bag file worked! For now I will stick with that.
