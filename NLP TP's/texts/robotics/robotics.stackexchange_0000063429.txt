Q:

Setting MoveIt! controller manager

I think the best available document for setting controller manager for MoveIt! is available from this QA post, which is not sufficient for me to do my task. Is there another document for this?
I have a controller (w/o source code) that takes trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory. I tried controller manager setting as below but still get the error.:
Created 99 (49 start + 50 goal) states in 75 cells (40 start (40 on boundary) + 35 goal (35 on boundary))
[ INFO] [1413825616.200813156]: Solution found in 0.828512 seconds

[ INFO] [1413825625.393148074]: Received new trajectory execution service request...
[ERROR] [1413825625.393265662]: Unable to identify any set of controllers that can actuate the specified joints: [ CARM/ELBOW_P CARM/LINEAR CARM/SHOULDER_P CARM/SHOULDER_R CARM/SHOULDER_Y CARM/WRIST_P CARM/WRIST_R CARM/WRIST_Y ]

Some values are just my random guess from looking at what others do (eg. maxwell, pr2).
X_moveit_config/config/controllers.yaml
controller_list:
  - name: arm_controller            # Can it be anything or is this specified somewhere?
    action_ns: joint_trajectory     # Can it be anything or is this specified somewhere?
    type: JointTrajectory
    default: true
    joints:
      - ARMGR/LINEAR
      - ARMGR/SHOULDER_Y
      - ARMGR/SHOULDER_R

    type: HandMove
    action_ns: gripper_action       # Can it be anything or is this specified somewhere?
    default: true

X_moveit_config/launch/X_moveit_controller_manager.launch

<!-- Set the param that trajectory_execution_manager needs to find the controller plugin -->
<arg name="moveit_controller_manager" default="moveit_simple_controller_manager/MoveItSimpleControllerManager" />
<param name="moveit_controller_manager" value="$(arg moveit_controller_manager)"/>

<!-- load controller_list -->
<rosparam file="$(find X_moveit_config)/config/controllers.yaml"/>

is it solved?,if yes, then can you just give the summary of procedure?

The documentation on this is lacking and tutorials insufficient. Any luck in finding a good tutorial on MoveIt with non-pr2 robots?
