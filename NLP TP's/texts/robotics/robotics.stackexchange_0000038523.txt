Q:

Turtlebot Kinect fails since dropped 100.00% of messages and wireless crashed

Hi, I am planning to test "Visualizing TurtleBot Kinect Data". I followed the tutorial from this:  http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot/Tutorials/Looking%20at%20Camera%20Data
I started the turtlebot service on the Laptop, use "lsusb" , I saw the device id of Kinect, so I am sure that the Kinect is recognised correctly by the operating system.
Here is the output from the Turtlebot Laptop.
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup kinect.launch

I am using Ubuntu10.04 x64 on the TurtleBot Laptop, installing ROS Electical version. On my workstation, the OS is Ubuntu10.04, installing ROS Electrical.
But every time, when I add camera from Rviz, the wireless connection between the TurtleBot Laptop between the Router would be crashed. This was very strange. How can a software make the wireless connection fail?
Do you have any advices or do you have the same problem?
Thanks in advance. Shan.

I have exactly the same setup (Ubuntu 10.04, ROS electric...) and exactly the same problem (dropped 100% of messages). So what is the solution ?????

A:

Hi,
One straight issue i see here is with the capacity of the transfer of clouds and images over the wireless communication. Advice would be to process the cloud and images at the laptop itself and get the results to the router. It might be actually problem with the configuration of the laptop.
Thanks, Karthik

Would you explain in more detail what commands we need to type? Thank you very much.
