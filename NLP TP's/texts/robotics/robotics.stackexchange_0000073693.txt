Q:

Use rosconsole with argument of type double

The wiki does not state which argument type rosconsole takes. How do I get the double printed with %d, the conversion to int is obviously working but not right. mmh
double distance = 0.1;
int tmp1 = int(distance);
ROS_DEBUG_THROTTLE(1,"min:%d", tmp1);

In case I use type double it wount compile

A:

The logging statements in C++ use printf-style formatting. For doubles, you should use the %f format specifier.
There are lots of good documents about the printf format types on the internet; for example: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/
