Q:

rosmsg md5 Cannot locate message

On a fresh install of Fuerte on Oneiric (desktop-full installed from binary packages)
the command rosmsg md5 does not appear to work:
$ rosmsg md5 std_msgs/String 
Cannot locate [std_msgs/String]

while rosmsg show works as expected:
$ rosmsg show std_msgs/String
string data

Any suggestion about what might be causing the problem or on how to investigate the issue further is much appreciated.

I have a suspicion that this is a bug. rosmsg show std_msgs/String works for me, but not md5 (same goes with a few other message types I've tried).

I can confirm this too. You should file a ticket.
