Q:

Hello,
for some reason I'm unable to install this package, I'm using this command:
sudo apt-get install -y ros-hydro-visp-tracker

and this is the error I'm getting:

You should edit your question to add that kind of information. It'll be easier for everyone.

thanks, but do you have any idea how to solve the problem ?

A:

This could be due to the migration of the visp-tracker package to catkin. Thomas Moulard (author/maintainer) posted to the ros-release mailinglist some days ago (from [1]):

Hello,
could you please add my account: tho..m..@gmail.com to ros-dry-releases?
I would like to remove vision_visp from the repository and release the
new one through Catkin and Bloom.

It could be that the rosbuild package has been removed, but the catkin package hasn't been released yet.

I see, thanks.
do you have any idea how to continue with the installation of rosjava (master)? I'm following this tutorial
wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/hydro/Source%20Installation
and I'm getting these errors:
pastebin.com/LV31s8g0
I'm new to the community and I appreciate all the help I can get

@AMiNAsFour: this looks like a completely new problem, you should open a new question for that.
