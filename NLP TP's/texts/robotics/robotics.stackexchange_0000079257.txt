Q:

dynamicEDTOctomap.h: No such file or directory

I installed dynamicedt3d library using sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-dynamicedt3d
Included in my CMakeLists as:

set(DYNAMICEDT3D_LIBRARIES "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/libdynamicedt3d.so")
include_directories( ${DYNAMICEDT3D_LIBRARIES} )
> add_executable(get_occupancy src/get_occupancy.cpp)
> target_link_libraries(get_occupancy $(DYNAMICEDT3D_LIBRARIES))

But while doing a catkin_make, I still get the error fatal error: dynamicEDTOctomap.h: No such file or directory
#include <dynamicEDTOctomap.h>
Can somebody help me figure this out?

A:

What you did was to declare your library file to be the include directory. This is clear whythis fails...
To quote from the dynamicEDT3DConfig.cmake:

#  Usage from an external project:
#    In your CMakeLists.txt, add these lines:
#
#    FIND_PACKAGE(dynamicedt3d REQUIRED )
#    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${DYNAMICEDT3D_INCLUDE_DIRS})
>     #    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MY_TARGET_NAME
>     ${DYNAMICEDT3D_LIBRARIES})

You should probably also add dynamic-edt-3d as a depend to your package.xml.

I was following a tutorial given here http://wiki.ros.org/mallasrikanth/octomap
But I think that is for an older version and the issue is solved now that I went back to simply finding package and including directories. Thanks!
