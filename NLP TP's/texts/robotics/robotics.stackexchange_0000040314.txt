Q:

run gazebo simulation without graphics output

Hello,
I'm not interested in graphics output so I would know if it is possible to run a simulation without displaying the output in order to speed up simulation.
Thank you!

A:

You can run gazebo headless with argument -r ( Check there for detailed informations )
However have a look on this question about some issues with -r options.
