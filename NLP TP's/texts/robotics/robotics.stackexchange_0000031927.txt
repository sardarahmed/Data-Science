Q:

Concepts of parameters and services

I'm going through this tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams) and am unclear about one thing. After setting a new parameter (rosparam set background_r 150), why we need to call clear service (rosservice call clear) to make the change take effect?
How do they work? Thanks!

A:

The parameter is only stored in the parameter server (that lives with roscore). When you change it the program does not necessarily know about this and will not react to a change.
The clear service call just triggers the program to redraw and in the process acquire the current (newly set) parameter.
For parameter changes that should take effect immediately there is dynamic_reconfigure.
