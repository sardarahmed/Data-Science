A:

How does the other program communicate now? A ROS program has access to all the ROS infrastructure, but it's just a process like any other and can communicate with any other process using whatever other means you have at your disposal. If you just have some ROS-agnostic classes that you want to use and they don't need to be an independent process, then include them, link against them, and use them as you would for any other program. If you want to communicate with some non-ROS process from a ROS node, then you have any number of options available to you, e.g., ActiveMQ, shared memory, etc.

thank you,I want to communicate with some non-ROS process from a ROS node, are there some built-in ros api I can use ?

I don't think so. Is this an existing process/program, or just a non-ROS class? You can always wrap your non-ROS classes in ROS if you want to pass data to them.
