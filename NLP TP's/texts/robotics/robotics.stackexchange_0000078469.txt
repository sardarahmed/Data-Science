Q:

using two nodes at a time

i have two nodes 1) which receives CAN messages from uc board to ROS (publisher) 2) which transmit CAN messages to uc board (subscribing). I need to run both the nodes in order to to these two tasks.
Now I am supposed to do: if receive node receives message, it should transmit a CAN message. How can I combine these two nodes or how can use one node information by other?. any suggestions

A:

you could implement the nodes as nodleds understand then nor those in an node, or you define a new topic which is your sync signal. if you receive a can message then you publisch to the sync topic and if the send node receive a sysnc topic then you write your CAN message.
