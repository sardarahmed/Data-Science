Would Java be a good option to use as a programming language for ROS?

I am not well versed with C++ so would using RosJava would be a better option?

A:

Python would be the preferred language for ROS imho. It's very easy to learn and very powerful as well. Maybe that would be an option?

I agree with @Chrissi. Try python if find C++ difficult. It's very easy and robust programming language!

I'd like to add that I find C++ somehow closer to Java than python so since the poster is a Java expert, it might be easier for him to start with C++.
