Q:

Why do current manipulators tend to use 7 DoF instead of 6 DoF?

In theory, controlling a 6D pose (3D position + 3D orientation) would require 6 joints, and - assuming the robot is carefully designed - the inverse kinematics should be solvable for that case.
Adding a 7th joint, and still targeting a 6D pose, would result in a null space of at least one dimension anywhere in the workspace. Why is this desirable?
My intuition is that it allows controlling the direction of the velocity and that the desired target changes; however, I didn't verify or investigate this so it is at most a best guess.

That is basically one the reasons people may wish to use a 7-DOF Robot for a 6-DOF End-Effector. It adds what is called Kinematic Redundancy. Your robot's end effector can reach a certain pose with different joint position sets.
Have a look at the following video for example:

As you can see, even though robot moves with changing some of the joint positions, end effector is not moving. You may wish to have multiple joint positions for a single end-effector pose if you have obstacles in the environment, or there is a possibility of your robot to have a self-collision.
Sometimes in industrial environments, these robot arms have limited free-space.  Even though a certain configuration can be achieved with multiple joint positions, one of them may cause robot to collide with its surroundings (another robot arms, a vehicle, and etc.).
