Q:

octovis for ros-electric

How to install octovis for ros-electric?
I tried $ sudo apt-get install ros-electric-octomap-visualization.
But it reported can't locate the package.
Then I read some of the discussions in ros.answers and tried from
$ svn co https://octomap.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/octomap/trunk octomap
and compiled using commands cmake and make
after that in the terminal I typed command $ ocotovis
It says command not found.
Any solutions?
Thanks in advance
Updated:
Also, while compiling I see the compilation is successful. I can see files inside folder build, bin and lib. Though, I am unable to open the octovis GUI. I used the above command to open that.

Did you check if it's build in a subdirectory like bin/?

Yes, it's built in the subdirectory. Though, it says command not found
Comment by dornhege on 2012-07-29:
So, did you execute the binary in bin/octovis or just type octovis?

yes, I got it. Thank you..

A:

If the file is in bin/octovis relative to your directory, execute bin/octovis.
