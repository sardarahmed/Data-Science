i think, this is usefull. Because, for example, footprint involved at common costmap parameter. This interested in robot's shape. This is relating for inflaction and costmap. But, if you use gazebo and rviz.

A:

In some cases, it would be required: Lidar slam packages like cartographer; Kalman filter packages like robot_localization.
If your robot will not use any existing packages that requires URDF file, you may skip it.
