Q:

groovy on Raring

Hi Guys,
I am having a lot of dependency issues for ROS installation on Raring.
Will there be a release of Groovy on raring, or will ROS move onto Hydro Medusa directly?
Thanks

A:

No, Groovy will not support Raring. Yes, Hydro Medusa will. But, note that Raring will probably have issues with packages not yet supporting Python 3.

Thanks joq. Yes, I spent some time and I ended up with the same conclusion. There are dependencies on older versions of basic ubuntu desktop libraries such as libice which makes groovy unsuitable for raring.
