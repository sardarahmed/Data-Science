Q:

Initial pose in amcl

Hi guys,
1)
How do you guys set your initial pose if the origin of map is [0.000, 0.000, 0.000] ?
Simply by estimation or there is a way to let us know the exact point we wanted?
2)
Inside this yaml file(map info) there is this resolution, how does the resolution affect as it changes?

A:

The simpler way to assign the initial pose to amcl is through rviz using the button '2D Pose Estimate'; this will publish the position on the /initialpose topic. Note that your fixed frame must be /map.

Maybe I didn't understand well the question... What do you mean?

How do you guys set an initial pose parameters? Simply guess the x y yaw value?

When I used amcl I always have done like this. Consider that even if the initial position is not precise, with amcl your robot can localize properly after moving it a little bit around.
