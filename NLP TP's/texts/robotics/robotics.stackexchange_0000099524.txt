Q:

How to use get_planning_pipeline_id?

How should I use get_planning_pipeline_id? It is not clear what I should input as planning_pipeline, an example in python would be appreciated.

A:

You need to set both the planning_pipeline_id and the planner_id. You can easily check the available pipelines and the planners of each pipeline in the RViz Motion Planning plugin, in the Context tab.
Example Python code:
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("your_planning_group")
group.set_planning_pipeline_id("pilz_industrial_motion_planner")
group.set_planner_id("LIN")
[...]
group.set_pose_target(your_pose)
group.go()

If only one pipeline is available, you should regenerate your moveit_config package.

What about the getter (get_planning_pipeline_id)? Why it requires planning_pipeline as parameter, if I just want to get? Is it perhaps a bug in the implementation?

Yes, that's a bug. It will be fixed shortly.

Got it, thanks. I'm opening an issue on moveit to track this.

It's fixed.
