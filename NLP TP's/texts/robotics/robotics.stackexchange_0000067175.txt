Q:

adding a python node that uses opencv - ROS Indigo

I followed this guide http://rodrigoberriel.com/2014/10/installing-opencv-3-0-0-on-ubuntu-14-04/
for setting up OpenCV for ROS Indigo (since it doesn't come bundled anymore).
Now, the problem is I don't have an executable node that is produced from a CPP source file for target_link_libraries but I have a python node that uses OpenCV.
After adding
1)
all the dependencies in "package.xml" file,
and 2)
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(${OpenCV_LIBS})

in the  CMakeLists.txt file, I get this error:
CMake Error at HELLO_WORLD/CMakeLists.txt:168 (target_link_libraries):
  Cannot specify link libraries for target "HELLO_WORLD" which is not built
  by this project.

How do I resolve this issue?
Other nodes written in Python, I can just say "rosrun [PACKAGE_NAME] python_node.py"
But in this Python node that uses OpenCV, I need to make changes appropriately in the CMakeLists.txt file. Only, I'm not quite sure what it is. sources I've referred to talk about CPP nodes.

A:

If you're only using OpenCV with python, you don't need to add anything in your CMakeLists.txt. As long as the python module is on your PYTHONPATH, you're all set.

Thanks! Yes, I realised that "import cv2" already exists in the code.
And it was pointed about by another gentleman on another post as well but this makes it clear :)
