Q:

Connection between ROS running on PC and mobile robot by TCP

Hi, I'm new with ROS. I have a robot (Pololu 3pi) with WLAN module. I would like to communicate with that robot wirelessly through TCP or WiFi (to remote control). I was looking some information on this site http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/TCPROS but i couldn't find anything helpful. I would be very grateful for any response.

Depending on you needs, you may only need to establish the correct RosNetwork settings - specifically, setting ROS_MASTER_URI to be the same on your machine and robot and only launching one roscore. Check out this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines

But how to set ROS_MASTER_URI on my robot (pololu 3pi)?? It has only Atmega328 controller.

applologies to the original post. I didn't look at your specific robot and was thinking you were already runninngvROS on it.

@gvdhoorn using rosserial, should I use arduino platform?
In this way it would look like this:
Arduino connected through wire with PC then Arduino connected with WLAN module through WiFi. Is that possible?

I'm not sure what you're trying to do exactly. rosserial is typically used to bridge an Arduino into a ROS node graph. The connection can be serial, serial over usb or a (wireless) network. I'm not sure why you'd want both a wired and a wireless connection.

A:

You could probably make use of rosserial. You don't want / need to run a full-blown ROS on such restricted hardware.
