Q:

Simulating the Kinect Output using a world

Lets say I start turtlebot up in the willow garage world as shown in:

Is there a way to simulate the Kinect PointCloud data that world would produce, so I can see it in rviz?
Best Regards,

Hi,
Yes you can see that Kinect cloud in the rviz. But this will only be the depth cloud and rgb cloud will not be present.
First run the gazebo using
roslaunch gazebo_worlds <your_world>.launch

Then launch the turtlebot_gazebo using
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo robot.launch

Now try visualizing the same on rviz
rosrun rviz rviz

You can see both images and pointclouds published by the simulated kinect in rviz.
Make sure your world has some objects to be scanned by the kinect.
Hope it helps,
Karthik
