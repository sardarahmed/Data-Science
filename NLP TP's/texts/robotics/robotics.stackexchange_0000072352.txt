A:

I think you might be missing what depthimage_to_laserscan does. In depth image, you have a depth value per pixel. This, together with the camera parameters, can be converted to X,Y,Z points. That package is simply transforming points at a given row of the depthimage to X,Y,Z by using the inverse Pin Hole model. There is not any algorithm.
