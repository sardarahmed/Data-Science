A:

When I saw this issue before, it was related to performing rosmake on a fuerte package when groovy was installed (likely the whole dry wet thing).
If you're running Ubuntu, I'd suggest first trying to install the package from the repo: sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-hector-slam

This worked for me, when I was getting the error: "[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names." after i use command "rosmake hector_slam"
