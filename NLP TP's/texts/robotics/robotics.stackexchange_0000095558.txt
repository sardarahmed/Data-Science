Q:

expcectedCycleTime in Ros2

Hi!
I am migrating a ros1 melodic program to Ros2 eloquent at the moment and I was wondering if there is a function similar to "expectedCycleTime".
I use ros rate to create a loop cycle. Now i want to get dynamic access to the Rate that is set.
Thanks in advance

A:

You can get the period of the Rate object using the period() method which is the the inverse of the "expectedCycleTime". The API was changed to be clearer about exactly what that datatype is returning. A cycle time is not clearly a rate.
API docs: http://docs.ros2.org/eloquent/api/rclcpp/classrclcpp_1_1GenericRate.html
