How to calculate attitude from IMU ? 
For example, mathematical equations 

A:

Altitude is usually determined from pressure and temperature sensors of an IMU.  You can see a formula here.  
However, you must realize that raw data from a sensor is NEVER RELIABLE.  Sensors do not always give a correct reading.  Instead, they give you a value somewhat close to the true value, but with some random "noise" added to it.  So, instead of just using the data that you obtain from the sensor, you should always filter out the noise using some form of kalman filter.
