Q:

Name conflict between msg and srv

I want publish a message reporting an actuator state change, but I also want to provide a service to allow setting that state. When I tried to create a msg called MyState and srv called MyState, catkin_make gives me a name conflict error. Why can't msg and srv files use the same name? Do they share the same namespace?

A:

No you cannot have a Msg and Srv of the same name in the same package. Messages and Services are identified by both the package they are in and the name. For example, std_msgs/String is different from your_package/String. You cannot, however, have std_msgs/Empty.msg and std_msgs/Empty.srv. That's why, for example, we have std_msgs/Empty (http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Empty.html) which is a message and a separate package for std_srvs/Empty (http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/std_srvs/html/srv/Empty.html) which is a service.
ROS 2 isn't ready yet, but this ambiguity doesn't exist in ROS 2 anymore. Messages and Services will not share a flat namespace.
