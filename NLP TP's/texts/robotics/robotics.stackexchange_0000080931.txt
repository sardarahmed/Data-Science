Q:

Installing Kinetic on Ubuntu 17.04: possible? Known issues?

I'm new to this but I saw this: "ROS Kinetic ONLY supports Wily (Ubuntu 15.10), Xenial (Ubuntu 16.04) and Jessie (Debian 8) for debian packages."
in here:
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
So wondering if there's any known problems In should be aware of. Thanks!     : ]

I've changed the title of your question to more accurately reflect what your question is -- and also to make it slightly more concise.

A:

Known problems (already during installation):

no binary packages available (the buildfarm doesn't build them for 17.04, as is stated on the install wiki page)
source build required, but:

not all dependencies may be available on 17.04 (pkgs might have been renamed / not released / something else)
dependencies are no longer compatible (ie: newer Boost versions with deprecated / removed / changed functionality, etc)

Apart from that: not many people will have run ROS on this version of Ubuntu, so the part of the community that could help you is probably also small.

Edit: ROS Lunar is available for Ubuntu 17.04 (see REP-003), so you could try that.

Note that these are not really "known problems" in the traditional sense: these are not issues that have been identified while running ROS on 17.04, but is more a speculation of what you will probably run into when/if trying to get ROS to run on unsupported OS releases.
