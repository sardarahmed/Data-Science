You mean when you start the build? You can do something like: --cmake-args -CMAKE_VEBOSE_MAKEFILE=TRUE when launching colcon command line.

I think this is actually supposed to be "--cmake-args -DCMAKE_VEBOSE_MAKEFILE=TRUE"

A:

If the CMake code hasn't changed I would expect colcon to behave the same as ament_tools (since it is basically invoking CMake and Make for you).
By default colcon doesn't show the output from stdout. Have you tried enabling the output as mentioned in the docs?
