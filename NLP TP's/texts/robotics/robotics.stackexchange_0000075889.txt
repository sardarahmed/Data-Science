A:

Try this "sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino" or "sudo apt-get install ros-jade-rosserial-arduino".(This might be helpful cuz Ubuntu 16.04 supports kinetic officially but you can also build the packages separately which is not recommended).
(Download the source from git hub: https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial and copy it in your local catkin_ws and run catkin_make. Not a recommended solution but for a workaround.)
I have tried "sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino" in Ubuntu 14.04. It is working fine.
you can also change the rosdistro to ros-jade i guess.
