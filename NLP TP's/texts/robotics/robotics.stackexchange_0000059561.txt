Q:

Stage simulation inconsistency

Hi there,
I do have a question concerning the simulation in stage. I read in the documentation that no noise is being simulated, nevertheless my results vary. As I run my node (exploration --> which depends on position and laser scan) on stage, my results like the required exploration time differ highly. Does someone have an idea what causes such behaviors?
Thanks in advance,
Daniel

A:

ROS nodes run asynchronously with respect to each other, so itÂ´s expected that the system is not fully deterministic. For example, depending on system load (and scheduling), messages might arrive in a different order in different trials, so variations in overall system behavior can happen. In most cases, these should be pretty small and much less than the effects of noise acting on a real system.
