Q:

Tutorial rosmsg error

Hi,
I was learning ROS by doing the tutorials. But at tutorial 5 (http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics) at section 13.1 I encountered the following error:
s0214828@pma-09-043:/net/pma-robot-quad/home/nfs/s0214828$ rosmsg show turtlesim/Velocity 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/s0214828/studentjob/ros-py3/ros/bin/rosmsg", line 35, in <module>
    rosmsg.rosmsgmain()
  File "/home/s0214828/studentjob/ros-py3/ros_comm/tools/rosmsg/src/rosmsg.py", line 537, in rosmsgmain

  File "/home/s0214828/studentjob/ros-py3/ros_comm/tools/rosmsg/src/rosmsg.py", line 255, in get_msg_text
    text = str(spec)
  File "/home/s0214828/studentjob/ros-py3/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/msgs.py", line 354, in __str__
    return _strify_spec(self)
  File "/home/s0214828/studentjob/ros-py3/ros/core/roslib/src/roslib/msgs.py", line 249, in _strify_spec
    buff.write("%s%s %s\n"%(indent, type_, name))
AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'write'

Does anyone know how I can resolve this error?
Thanks,
Peter
