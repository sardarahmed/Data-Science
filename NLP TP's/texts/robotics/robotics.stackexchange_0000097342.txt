Q:

Make global plan that includes obstacles from local costmap

Hi,
I have a navigation setup for a mobile robot. Local and global costmaps are running and navigation is working, however I would like to have the global planner replan when it sees obstacles in the local costmap. There are situations where it should come up with a new global plan because a pathway is blocked, but now the robot just stops. How can I make the global planner take local costmap obstacles into account if a pathway is blocked in order to generate a new global path?

A:

The culprit in my case was the plugins defined in the local and global costmap yaml-files. After removing those plugins and just using the normal settings everything works as expected.
The robot now makes a new global plan when its initial pathway is blocked, see the video below:
