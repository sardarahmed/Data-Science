Q:

Can't build the face recognition package

Hi,
I got face recognition tutorial on ros wiki page:
www.ros.org/wiki/face_recognition
but i can't build it. I tried to build the workspace using catkin_make and rosmake.
I use the command "catkin-make" in the face_recognition workaspace but it already contains a CMakeLists.txt so the command doesn't work. I also tried the "rosmake face_recognition" but I have this error "ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names." despite the fact that there is a "stack.xml" file in the folder.
Can somebody help me please?
Thank you

Please edit your question to include more information, like the exact commands you are executing and the full output you are getting.

Sorry. I edit the question.

A:

This is a rosbuild/rosmake package, so don't try to build it with catkin. The code hasn't been touched for the last two years it seems, so not sure if you can make it work easily.
Please make sure the stack is contained in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable.
What does env | grep -i ROS output?
Edit:
To add your folder to ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, you need to exectue export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/your/folder/containing/face/recognition:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH after the source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash command. You can either do this directly in the terminal, or add it to your .bashrc file.

The output is :
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ros/hydro/lib
CPATH=/opt/ros/hydro/include
PATH=/opt/ros/hydro/bin:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
PWD=/opt/ros/hydro/lib/gscam
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=hydro
PYTHONPATH=/opt/ros/hydro/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/ros/hydro/lib/pkgconfig
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/ros/hydro
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros
OLDPWD=/opt/ros/hydro
The stack is not in my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. How can I add it?

Thank you, It works. But if I do a "source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash", the path is cleaned so I have to do it again. Is there a way to change definitly the path?

put both commands in your .bashrc
Comment by RosFaceNoob on 2014-04-01:
I add those lines to my '.bashrc' but it doesn't work.
"source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/procrob_functional-master:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"

Have you opened a fresh terminal afterwards?

I just forgot to source the file before testing. It's fine now
