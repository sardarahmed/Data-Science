Q:

ekf_localization control command

Hi!
I just saw it now is possible add to the filter a control command, but looking at the code this control applies on the accelerations directly, and not x(t + 1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t).
What model use in the filter?
The command of my robot is linear velocity and angular velocity, How i do it?
Thanks.

A:

I think the control_config can control the input of your integration.
and I think its order is Vx,Vy,Vz,VRoll,Vpitch,Vyaw.
