A:

Please see REP-3 - Target Platforms - Platforms by Distribution - Kinetic Kame (May 2016 - May 2021) and Lunar Loggerhead (May 2017 - May 2019).
So you'll have to upgrade to at least Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) to be able to use either of those.
Note that this is also clearly stated on the installation pages on the ROS wiki.
For Kinetic (here):

These instructions will install the ROS Kinetic Kame distribution, which is available for [..] Ubuntu Xenial (16.04 LTS) [..]

For Lunar (here):

These instructions will install the ROS Lunar Loggerhead distribution, which is available for Ubuntu Zesty(17.04), Xenial (16.04 LTS) [..]
