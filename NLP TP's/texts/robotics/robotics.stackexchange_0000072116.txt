Q:

teb local planner installation

Hi all,
I am trying to install and use the teb_local_planner in ROS hydro by following this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner/Tutorials/Setup%20and%20test%20Optimization
However, I am getting the following errors:
powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-teb-local-planner
[sudo] password for powerbot67:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-teb-local-planner
powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~$ rosdep install teb_local_planner

ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource teb_local_planner
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

Any ideas on what I am doing wrong?
Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

A:

Afaict, teb_local_planner has not been released into Hydro. See the wiki/teb_local_planner page (notice no Hydro button in the version rocker), and status_page/hydro.html?q=teb_local_planner.
Options:

upgrade to Indigo
try to install teb_local_planner from source on Hydro: this will probably fail (but it depends on the differences between the Hydro and Indigo+ versions of the navigation stack and any other dependencies it might have)

Thanks for your reply @gvdhoorn. I'll try installing teb_local_planner from source in the next few days.
