Q:

How to use --headless-rendering on Fortress

I ran this line, ign gazebo -r models/sdf/freenove_smart_car.sdf --headless-rendering and ign gazebo --headless-rendering -r models/sdf/freenove_smart_car.sdf
Both return the same result where it display GUI and made an output like this:
ign gazebo Unable to setup EGL (headless mode)

Is this expected or a bug?
If this is the bug, I will close this and create an issue on the github.

A:

This was bug. It's fixed now. If you want to learn how to use it, use ign gazebo --help in command line
