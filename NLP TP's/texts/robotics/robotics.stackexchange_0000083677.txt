Q:

how to publish topics while using messagefilter?

Hi,
I am using an LRF and a servo for my application and need to synchrnize the position of servo and laser data in time. I looked into message_filter and trying to play with it. I was wondering whether ApproximateTime synchronizer publishes on any topic or if not then how to get the data to publish in user defined topic? I looked into quite a few previously discussed answers on this issue here, but could not understand this part.
I need to access the synchronized dataset for servo and lidar.
thanks,

A:

Ok, I got a solution. I initialized publishers on required topics as global variable. Then,  published in the callback of the registercallback in the message_filter.
