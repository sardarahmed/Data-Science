Q:

ROS-plugin for QT Creator

Not sure wether this is the right place for this question, but I don't really know where else I might find an answer for this.
The thing is, I'm on my roscpp code in QT Creator. I found out, there is a ROS-plugin for this IDE, but on the Computers that I'm working on, I don't have admin rights and therefor can't install the plugin as described here. Is there any way to install this plugin on linux without being able to use sudo?

Can you clarify where in those instructions you believe you should use sudo?
The plugin comes with a Qt Creator installation and places everything in your $HOME directory, so sudo should not be needed.
It's only used in those instructions to remove something, but only then if you had that on your system in the first place:

If previously installed using the ppa please follow the procedure below to remove old version

My bad, I'm sorry. You are right, sudo isn't necessary
