Q:

In URDF how do I get more than one geomtry element in a link?

I would like to build a simple robot model in urdf with just visualization and display it in rviz. I just have one tf frame for the body (it is a quad rotor) so how can I use the same frame for more than on geometry element?
Or is it possible to take a 3D model and just use that?

A:

Short answer is that you currently can't do exactly what you're saying.
The easiest way to get around it is to create a second link with an appropriate offset, connected with a fixed joint.
This does create an extra frame which will need to be published. This is most often handled with robot_state_publisher.

I suppose I will get one extra frame per geomtry I want to have. I was afraid that would give possible delays but maybe it will work. I will test it. SO if I used tix joints I can use robot_state_publisher. I assume I could also just have no joints and just publish the frames from my program.
Comment by David Lu on 2013-02-21:
robot_state_publisher is a little wonky, I think, in that it will only publish tfs when it gets joint state messages, so you may also need joint_state_publisher.

Joint state is not needed if you only have static links.
It is necessary with dynamic links.
