Q:

ROS2 Humble on Windows 10 - RVIZ2 gives error "Process exited with failure 3221225595"

I am trying to use RVIZ2 on Windows 10 with ROS2 Humble, without much success so far. Running (after activating local_setup.ps1):
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2

Returns with the message:

[ros2run]: Process exited with failure 3221225595

When running the executable directly:
C:\dev\ros2_humble\bin\rviz2.exe

I get no messages at all, but the exit code is -1073741701.
I can reproduce this with Windows Sandbox (although the numbers are slightly different), with a fresh and default install of Humble.
ROS2 is working normally and I have installed Qt 5.12.12.
What could be the problem here?

A:

Partial answer already: I noticed that when I ran rviz2.exe directly from Explorer by double clicking I got a bunch of error dialogues about missing DLLs. Unsurprising, because it's missing the ROS2 environment.
So from the ROS2 environment I ran:
start C:\dev\ros2_humble\bin\rviz2.exe

(I did it without start ... before.) Now I got a meaningful error: I got a dialogue with a missing DLL for zlib1.dll. After searching I see that C:\dev\ros2_humble\opt\rviz_ogre_vendor\bin\zlib.dll does exist. So I created a symbolic link for the file zlib1.dll to solve this:
cd ...
mklink "zlib1.dll" "zlib.dll"

This fixed RVIZ2 on my PC!
In the sandbox I have more errors: "OpenGL 1.5 is not supported", but that is outside this scope.
