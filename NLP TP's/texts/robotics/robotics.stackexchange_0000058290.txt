Q:

Interactive Markers Teleop (groovy) has rviz error and doesn't work

Hi all, I have a turtlebot 2. I roslaunch "turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch" on turtlebot and configure the network as http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/groovy/Network%20Configuration. Afterwards I run commands (http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_interactive_markers/Tutorials/UsingTurtlebotInteractiveMarkers) on my workstation I met errors: Grid and RobotModel on the left of rviz window are red-marked, and both of then have a sub-red-marked Status: Error. After choosing InteractiveMarkes and Interact, I dragged the mouse but turtlebot didn't move. Pls give me a hand, thanks!

A:

Did you try roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch? I recommend that you check whether turtlebot moves. I don't try InteractiveMarkers yet, but my experiment might be usefull for you http://answers.ros.org/question/139701/turtlebot2-doesnt-work-with-amcl_demolaunch/. I guess that the problem is /etc/hosts. I think that you need to check if your turtlebot receives messages that rviz publishes.
