Q:

Convert geometry_msgs/twist to asctec_msgs/CtrlInput

Hi,
I am working with an asctec pelican and ros. I wanna control the pelican via ros, but the pelican need asctec_msgs/CtrlInput messages. But most things in ros publishes geometry_msgs/twist as velocity commands.
My question is, is there something in ros which can be used to translate the twist messages to CtrlInput messages ?
Or does somebody knows something about the asctec/CtrlInput? I would write the node myself, but I do not know much about the CtrlInput messages?

Take a look at the STARMAC package, they use AscTec Pelican. http://www.ros.org/wiki/starmac-ros-pkg
