Q:

Can I visualize a voxel_grid on RViz?

Costmap_2D publishes voxel_grid (type costmap_2d/VoxelGrid) when publish_voxel_map parameter is set to true, but I cannot find the proper display on RViz. I suppose I need to install the appropriate plugin, but I cannot find it.
Thanks

A:

There is no appropriate plugin to my knowledge. You could write one, or you could use the costmap_markers node provided in the costmap_2d package.
