Q:

Local costmap has unknown space where no obstacle in laser range

Hi,
in my simulations the local costmap has unknown space for directions where there is no obstacle, see image:

I think it should be the same or a similar problem described here: http://answers.ros.org/question/190170/local-cost-map-not-updated/
How do I fix this? The other thread also offers no clear solution.
Thanks,
Micha

A:

Once again, I answer myself: The solution is to unset the following parameter for the local costmap:
track_unknown_space: false

For the global costmap the parameter is still true though.
