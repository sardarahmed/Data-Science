Q:

gazebo failed on virtualbox with fuerte

I use ubuntu 11.10 on virtualbox with 3D support.
I run
  roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world.launch 

And when I click plane1_model's body and move cursor to gazebo world, gazebo exited.

 OpenGL Warning: crPackDrawElements: trying to use bound but empty      elements buffer, ignoring.
 Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
 exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
 reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

How to solve it?
Thank you~

Ogre often has trouble doing 3D graphics in a virtual machine. You may need to run it with a real driver (i.e. without virtualbox).
