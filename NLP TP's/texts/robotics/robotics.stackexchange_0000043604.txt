Q:

Configure ROSTest + Hudson for individual bug reports?

Hey gang,
Since I notice that Willow Garage is using Hudson for managing their build process, I was hoping somebody could help me understand if there's a way to set up my own Hudson (which I've done) and config it and ROSTest to generate individual bug reports, rather than the 1 big build + test report.
As I currently have things, my hudson server is performing a clean checkout of my ROS project every night, then invoking a small script which sets up the paths, performs the "rosmake" (which puts out a bunch of output on the console) and then I have it trigger the "make test" in each package/stack that we're working on to run the unit tests. If ANY of these fail, it produces a single master roll-up error report that Hudson posts to our bug tracking system.
What I'd really prefer to do is have each unit test generate it's own bug report if there is a problem (we're using Collabnet's Teamforge system and the Hudson Collabnet plugin.)
Is there a way to set things up to do that?

A:

tests in ros produce standard junit xml output.  You can parse them anyway you want and send triggers however you want as well.  That's more of a Jenkins type issue.  I suggest you contact the Jenkins forums.
