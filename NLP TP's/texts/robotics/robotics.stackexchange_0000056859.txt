Q:

Simple scripting for PR2

Hello,
I'm thinking about some super simple solution for controlling PR2. It should be understandable for newbies - students and allow them to make simple demos. Something like cob_script_server. Is there something specific for PR2, or maybe is there existing configuration for mentioned script server?

A:

A few years ago when we were taking the PR2s to the Hack the Future event for kids, a few of us at Willow wrote the pr2_hack_the_future stack, which includes a simple web interface, a script queue, and a simplified interface for interacting with the PR2: pr2_simple_interface.
It's currently undocumented, unmaintained, and out of date, but it's probably still better than starting from nothing.
