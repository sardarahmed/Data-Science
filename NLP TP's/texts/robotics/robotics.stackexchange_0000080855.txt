Q:

Which dynamixel package shoud be used?

Does anyone have experience with both "dynamixel_motor" and ("dynamixel_sdk" or "dynamixel_workbench")
If I am understanding correctly, it seems that "dynamixel_motor" has long been the package ROS community has been using.
However, now there is an official package from ROBOTIS called "dynamixel_sdk" and "dynamixel_workbench"? But, it does not yet seem popular.
I am leaning toward the official package because it is official package but does it have all capabilities of "dynamixel_motor" package? Has anybody tried these new official packages? Any thoughts on which package I should start with for my motors (MX-12W)?

A:

ROBOTIS has started ROS supports in earnest last year. We have many useful packages and maintain its every day.
The dynamixel_sdk is a ROS wrapper for the ROBOTIS Dynamixel SDK. It is a software development library that provides Dynamixel control functions(like "sync_write") for packet communication. It is designed for Dynamixel actuators using protocol 1.0(AX, RX, MX, PRO) or protocol 2.0(X series(It is NEW series!!)). Moreover, it supports all programming languages used by ROS(C++, Python).
The dynamixel_workbench is developed by using "dynamixel_sdk". ''single_manager'' shows Dynamixel status using ROS Topic and it can helps access all control tables of Dynamixel in terminal and even GUI("single_manager_gui"). So, anyone can change ID, Baudrate, Operating Mode and other data in ROS. (We have been developing "dynamixel_manager" in Linux version. It will be showed soon.) "dynamixel_workbench_controller" and "dynamixel_workbench_tutorial" are showed how to use "dynamixel_sdk" in ROS. It supports how to launch Dynamixel actuators have different operating mode. ROS user who want to use Dynamixel for their platform can use this packages.
"dynamixel_motor" is compact and user-friendly package and it has been supporting Dynamixel in ROS. We are grateful for maintainer who helps our products.
Nowadays, ROBOTIS supports ROS. "dynamixel_sdk" and "dynamixel_workbench" provide software for all Dynamixel actuator and its are updated every day. After using our nice packages, please feel free to give feedback or question. We are ready to any issues. Thanks :)
