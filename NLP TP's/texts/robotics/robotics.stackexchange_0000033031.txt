Q:

How to add the node name in warning or fatal message?

Because I use a launch file to launch many nodes.
If there exist any method to output the message with corresponding node name,
it will be easier to debug.
Thank you~

A:

Check section 7 of rosconsole. You can include the node name in the output format.

Thanks~~I figured out the answer such as : export ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT='${severity}:${node}:${file}:${function}:${time}:${message}'
