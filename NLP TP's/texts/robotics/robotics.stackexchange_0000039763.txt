Q:

How to make launch files?

Hi, I've been reading some examples of ROS programs, and one of my questions so far is how can I create the launch file I need for the purpose of my program?, what is the correct scheme?, where can I find some sort of a list of commands I need in order to create a launch file? Is there any documentation about it?
Thanks (:
