Q:

Turn off video stabilization for bebop drone

For the purposes of my project, we want to read the live video feed of a parrot bebop 2 drone, but without any video stabilization running. I'm using ROS with the bebop_autonomy package to do so. However, the footage is automatically stabilized.
I tried adjusting the parameter PictureSettingsVideoStabilizationModeMode through rqt_reconfigure, but this seems to have no effect. Is there another parameter that needs to be adjusted, or is there something that I need to do before the change takes effect?
I'm using the latest version of the package, compiled from source (commit d386d20).

I feel like you may have a better chance at getting a good answer by reporting this to AutonomyLab/bebop_autonomy/issues. If the dyn_recfg infra shows that option, then it should work. If not, that seems like a potential bug. So report?

A:

I've update the driver to support SDK 3.10.x and firmware 3.9. I can confirm that you can now disable video stabilisation using dynamic reconfigure. The corresponding ROS parameter is ~PictureSettingsVideoStabilizationModeMode.
The code has been merged into the main branch of bebop_autonomy.
