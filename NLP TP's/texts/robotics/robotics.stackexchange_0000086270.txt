Q:

TutrleBot2 installtion for kinetic

Hello everybody!
I am new learner to ROS. I am using TurtleBot2 for learning purpose. But wen i visit ros website for installation of TurtleBot2, i found that it's not available for Kinetic. this is written on the website when I click on Kinetic version.

Recently overhauled entire tutorial for indigo (24/03/15).

Then what should I do ? Do i need to install previous versions for ROS like Indigo  etc. Please guide me about this problem. Thanks.
