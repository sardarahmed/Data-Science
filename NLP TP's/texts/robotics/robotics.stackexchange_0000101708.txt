Q:

Can't locate node [joints_receive_from_arduino.py] in package [ros_control_example]

I have been trying to build and run ros_control_example(https://github.com/bandasaikrishna/ros_control_example) package.
But, it seems I have done something wrong.
I have created catkin_ws folder and cloned it from github to catkin_ws/src folder and catkin_make finished without any error. And also I have added it to .bashrc(source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash)
But when I try to run this package with "roslaunch ros_control_example check_velocity_controller.launch"
it gives "ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ros_control_example/joints_receive_from_arduino.py]: can't locate node [joints_receive_from_arduino.py] in package [ros_control_example]" But that python code "joints_receive_from_arduino.py" is under "~/catkin_ws/src/ros_control_example/ros_control_example/scripts/" folder.
And an empty rviz starts.
What should I have to do to solve this issue?

I've updated the title of your post to better reflect what the problem is you report.
This is not related to RViz.

A:

Did you make your file readable? I mean the python file .
Chmod +Ã— (name of .py file )
In the package you cloned you will have a .py file in the launch file
You have to make the .py file executable from the src folder . Cd into the src and  make the file readable
