Q:

stdr_simulatorTutorialsCreate a map with gmapping - "the right topic"?

In this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/stdr_simulator/Tutorials/Create%20a%20map%20with%20gmapping in section 4 it says:

After you have subscribed to the correct topic, you should see the generated map by gmapping...

What's the "correct topic" and how do I subscribe to it in Rviz? Thanks!

A:

You can get the correct topic in RViz by

Clicking the "Add" button
Clicking on the "By topic" tab in the popup
Search for the topic under the /gmapping node (or whatever name you have given it) that has a message type of nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid (most likely the /map topic)
Click "Ok"
