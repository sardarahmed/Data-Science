Q:

How do I build ROS VLP16 Velodyne driver for Indigo using Catkin

Hi,
I am a noob to both linux and ROS. I installed ROS indigo and the velodyne stack. Later, I found that the apt-get version does not contain the vlp16_points.launch. I have read other posts in this ROS answers forum discussing about building the velodyne package from source using catkin. There aren't any instructions in the velodyne github page either explaining this procedure. Can someone tell me how to build this package (https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne) using catkin_make in Ubuntu? Should I just clone it to a folder and invoke catkin_make from that folder? I really need help regarding this build procedure as I need to get this up running ASAP.  Thanks in advance.

A:

First, build a catkin workspace:
$ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne.git

Install all the dependencies:
$ cd ..
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

Then, build everything:
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash

Thank you:) I successfully got the drivers into my Ubuntu machine! But, now I have a problem receiving the UDP packets in the Ubuntu Virtual machine. I will probably post a separate question for that!

Yes, please make that a separate question. Your virtual machine may not be configured correctly. You can use wireshark to see if any packets are being received.
