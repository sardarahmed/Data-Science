Q:

xacro command not found

I am trying to run a xacro command to generate the latest baxter.srdf file to use with Moveit config.  I found the command in a readme file in the baxter_moveit_config folder.  It has been modified to give the paths to the files since it was having trouble finding them:
xacro --inorder ~/ros_ws/src/moveit_robots/baxter/baxter_moveit_config/config/baxter.srdf.xacro left_electric_gripper:=true right_electric_gripper:=true left_tip_name:=left_gripper right_tip_name:=right_gripper >> ~/ros_ws/src/moveit_robots/baxter/baxter_moveit_config/config/baxter.srdf

I keep getting:
xacro:  command not found

I have sourced everything properly:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash

I even ran a catkin_make and tried it again.  When I run rospack find xacro it returns the location of it.  I am running it on Ubuntu 14.04 with Ros Indigo.
printenv | grep ROS output:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/baxter/ros_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_DISTRO=indigo
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros

Any suggestions?

How have you installed ROS? The xacro binary should be located at /opt/ros/<version>/bin/xacro You can install it manually with sudo apt-get install ros-<version>-xacro

It is installed and I have ran it many times.  I can try manually installing the xacro package again to see if that fixes it though.  Here is were rospack find says it is:
/opt/ros/indigo/share/xacro

Can you add the output of the linux command printenv | grep ROS to your question, so we can check your environment.

I ran the install and the rospack find came back with the same location.  I get the same command not found message when I run the xacro command.

A:

I don't believe xacro is put on the regular PATH on Trusty/Indigo. That is only in Kinetic (and Jade probably). You should probably use rosrun xacro xacro ...

Note: the readme you refer to (probably this one) is the readme for Kinetic. The Indigo one (this one) does not contain any instructions to generate an .srdf.

If that is the case then I somehow loaded the incorrect version.  Do I need to switch it?  I want to do a project with Flexbe and I need to run MoveIt configuration wizard to setup the points. Can I run the Kinetic package on an Indigo ROS setup?

You'd have to ask the maintainers of that package whether that is possible.
