@tbh  can u  help us in it plz ?

A:

The error message indicates that
configure: error: "Cannot find SWI-Prolog. SWI-Prolog must be installed first"

That means you didn't install swi-prolog, after running
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog

rosmake re_comm again.

json_prolog is part of the knowrob stack. I would suggest to not install it from souce anyway but with sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-knowrob. That will pull in all required dependencies, including swi-prolog.
