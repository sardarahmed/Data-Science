Q:

Log and print Clearpath Husky sensor data with ROS and joy node

Hello,
I'm driving Husky A200 by using a joystick with this command:
roslaunch clearpath_teleop example.launch

everything works OK, but I would like to print in the shell and also write in a text file the current used by the motors, the temperature and in particular the linear and  angular velocity.
I know that clearpath_teleop cmd_vel publishes some information, but how can I read them and save them in a text file?

A:

rosbag can be used to save data that is published. There is logging for C++ & Python.  I don't believe that the Husky publishes motor current and temperature.
