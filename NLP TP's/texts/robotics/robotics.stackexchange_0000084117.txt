Q:

ImportError while installing ROS2 from source

I followed the instructions for installing ROS2 from source (from github wiki).
Isolated and non-isolated build:
src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py build --build-tests --symlink-install <--isolated>: I'm getting a Import Error: No module named 'catkin_pkg' and a NameError: name 'catkin_pkg' is not defined.
The errors occur at line number 34 and 48 in ros1_bridge/__init__.py.
$ <path-to-python> -c 'import catkin_pkg' reproduces this error.
Any ideas why? Is there a step that I've missed? Should there be a sudo -H pip install catkin_pkg rospkg somewhere in the docs?

I would really suggest you report this at the ROS2 github issue tracker.

A:

Yes, the ros1_bridge package depends on a number of ROS 1 packages. These are not listed in the main ROS 2 installation instructions that you linked to, but in the ros1_bridge-specific instructions at: https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/README.md
Note that there is a particular order in which ROS 1 and ROS 2 workspaces need to be sourced, so you'll need to pay close attention to the steps in the instructions when building from source.
