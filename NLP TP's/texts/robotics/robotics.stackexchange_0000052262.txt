A:

This means that the package opencv2 is not in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  Please make sure it is there.  What is your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and where do you find opencv2 on your system?

i checked everything twice. opencv is included in the package-path. i solved the problem by adding "find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)" in the CmakeList.txt and deleting "" from manifest.xml
