Q:

Suggestions requested for writing ROS plugins

I am new to writing Rviz plugins. What would be the preferred method/ rviz class lists that I could look into for visualizing line segments, circles and beziers for writing rviz plugin?"
Thanks

A:

You'll want to subclass rviz::Display. For examples (assuming C++), you can download the RViz source code and look at the
default plugin classes.
Edit: also, go over the Display plugin tutorial. I personally work better from actual source code examples, but the tutorial may helpful.
