Q:

nxt for ROS hydro

Any chance there is support for the NXT on hydro. Or a .URDF for MoveIt. I know there are people that have used NXT in MoveIt but there is little support that I can find. Does anyone have any examples?

A:

I have stared making an attempt at https://github.com/chalko/ros-nxt/tree/catkinize  However I am completly new to ROS.  Any help would be appreciated.  Or any pointers to others work.
I have made some progress on this
set your .rosinstall to
- git: {local-name: nxt_python, uri: 'https://github.com/chalko/nxt-python.git'} 
- git: {local-name: nxt, uri: 'https://github.com/chalko/ros-nxt.git'} 

then
catkin_make

And you will at least be able to run
rosrun nxt_python nxt_test

which on my machine says
NXT brick name: Nick-NX 
Host address: 00:16:53:13:8C:D3 
Bluetooth signal strength: 0 
Free user flash: 61688 
Protocol version 1.124 
Firmware version 1.31 
Battery level 7422 mV

@nick-j-chalko: I've also catkinized the nxt-package (https://github.com/ToPitz/nxt_ros_catkin). Currently I'm testing and migrating the package to nxt_python 2.2 - Perhaps we could help each other...
@drews256: Have you tried the catkinized package under hydro?

@mdtobi, that is great.  Yes I am using hydro.
So what have you got to work so far?

Hello, I'm sorry and maybe I'm totally stupid, but I have problem with this command:

git: {local-name: nxt_python, uri: https://github.com/chalko/nxt-python.git'}

Should I put the command to terminal exactly like above ?
If I do that, I'm getting: -: command not found .
Or how to set .rosinstall ??
I have a hydro on Ubuntu 13.04.
THX!

hello, i am working with nxt too but with electric version. I am thinking in change to nxt_ros_catkin that you are speaking. Do you try this version? (https://github.com/ToPitz/nxt_ros_catkin). IN what ubuntu version and ros version are you working?
thanks million!
