Q:

Using SLAM map in a custom node

I have followed the SLAM Gmapping tutorial. I have used rviz to set the goal for the robot.
I want to write a program in which robot moves autonomously. Therefore, I want to ask how can I set the current pose and navigation goal in the code (cpp node) without using the rviz? And also how can I used the learned (and saved) map in my code (cpp node)?

A:

The goal can be set by using the actionlib server provided by the move_base node. There are tutorials on how to do  this.
