Q:

load custom world in gazebo from a launch file

Hello everyone,
I've built a custom wold for gazebo (dae file) and I'm trying to load this file from a launch file. When I run the world file directly from gazebo, it woks and I can see the world (gazebo maze.world). But when I build a launch file and include the world file inside the launch file, I get the following error:
Error [SystemPaths.cc:367] File or path does not exist[""]
Error [Visual.cc:2138] No mesh specified

Here is the content of the world file (maze.world):

and here is the launch file(maze.launch):

both launch file and world file are in the same directory and I've set the GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH to that directory. Can someone tell me what's the problem here? I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, Indigo, and gazebo_ros.
Thanks

A:

I think the problem may be related to how the mesh file location is specified:
<mesh><uri>file://maze_parallel_wall.dae</uri></mesh>
I would recommend following an example from gazebo_models, such as the cordless drill:
<mesh><uri>model://cordless_drill/meshes/cordless_drill.stl</uri></mesh>
