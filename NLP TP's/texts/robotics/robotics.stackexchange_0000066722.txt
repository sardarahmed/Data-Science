Q:

MotionPlanning in Moveit only partly works?

Hello List,

Using Indigo I created a setup with moveit setup assistent and an urdf for our crustcrawler arm.
The urdf is adapted from the smart_arm_robot.xacro from ua-ros-pkg.
The urdf works fine using rviz and joint_state_publisher.
But with Planning Request in Moveit/Rviz the eef-joint (wrist_roll_joint) gets DETACHED from the rest of the arm.
Normally the rest of the arm should follow, but it does NOT move while the (moved) eff-joint immediatly turns red.
The moveit-command however DOES work. I can see the moves in Rviz when I give e.g. "go rand".
Also the pr2 example does work perfectly.
You can find my setup in http://fwn06.housing.rug.nl/ros
I only used the setup wizard and used an urdf I am fairly confidant about.
Why does the planning in MotionPlanning not work ?
Thanks in advance,
Sietse

A:

To answer my own question:
I had to flag "Allow Approximate IK Solutions" to get it to work.
I don't know why this is needed (of how I could have known this), but for the moment it works for me.

That option is almost always needed to work around the fact that your manipulator has < 6dofs, and the MoveIt interactive markers control a 6D Pose. The IK plugin used (probably KDL) cannot solve for a 6D pose with less than 6dof in your robot, hence the need to allow approximate solutions.

OK, clear. Thanks!
