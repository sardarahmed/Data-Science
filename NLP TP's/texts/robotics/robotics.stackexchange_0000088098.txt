Q:

ROS co-ordinate system for orientation

So I know through reading http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html that the ROS co-ordinate frame follows the right hand rule.  So when getting transformation data from a VR device I have to convert:
x= -z,
y=-x,
z= y
I've managed to map movements of positions correctly, however I'm having trouble with rotations...
I tried doing the same mapping for for rotations & it doesn't seem to work.   Is there another rule I have to adhere to or another conversion I can do to get correct mapping for orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)? or perhaps a way to find the correct mapping..?
Thanks!

What are you trying to do? 2) Did you check this? https://answers.unity.com/storage/temp/12048-lefthandedtorighthanded.pdf

Can you provide more info on what your setup looks like? What information is your device reporting (e.g., position, velocity, orientation, acceleration, angular vel)?

Hi, I'm trying to map HTC controllers to a Baxter robot through ROS to achieve teleoperation.  Right now, I believe I have got the position (x, y ,z) mapped correctly using the right hand rule, but struggling with orientation now...

A:

You can convert any left-handed coordinate system to right-handed by flipping the sign of one of its axes. [1] By changing more axes, you are rotating the coordinate system.

A quaternion (x, y, z, w) in a left-handed coordinate system (x,y,z) should simply become (x, y, -z, w) in a right-handed coordinate system (x, y, -z). Please try it out and report back.
