Q:

Error while trying to follow tutorial

Hello everyone,
I'm currently learning how to use ROS, but while I was following the tutorials in part 3 of the tutorial, I encountered an error. I was at the part where I try to edit:
The beginner_tutorials
When I try to change what's inside of the <> I get this error:
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
The same thing happens when I try do edit anything in the <> in the next few part of the tutorials.
Thanks in advance.

Well in the tutorial it said i could change it to anythine i wanted. So i just changed it to test instead of deacription.

A:

You cannot change the tags in the XML file: i.e., what's inside the <> angle brackets. Rather, you can change what's between the two tags, i.e., you can write
 ABCDEF 
or something else. But the tags themselves are predefined and when this xml file is read, the system looks for what's between the description tags. So changing the tag itself will result in the system not understanding what you are specifying.
