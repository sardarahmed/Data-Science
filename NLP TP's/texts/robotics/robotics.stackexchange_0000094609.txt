Q:

Autoware 1.13 Lane_planner / velocity profile

Hi everyone,
I think I have a quite simple question, but I can not find a solution or anything in the documentation.
Until know I used mainly the OpenPlanner or recorded waypoints with a velocity. Now I would like to use the lane_planner and waypoint_planner. But I have issues with the velocity control, my vehicle does not slow down in front of curves. Which node is responsible for the calculation of the velocity profile of the waypoints based on the curvature?
Autoware version 1.13.
ROS Melodic
Thanks a lot for your help!
Best,
Markus

A:

@mschratter The waypoint_replanner node handles this function. You need to set replan_curve_mode to true and the radius_thresh and radius_min parameters. You can launch the waypoint_loader, waypoint_replanner, and waypoint_marker_publish by using the waypoint_loader.launch file from the waypoint_maker package.
