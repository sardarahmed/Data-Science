Q:

launch a node within another node

Hi All,
I have two nodes: A and B implemented in C++. Now I want Node A to be launched (by the program, not by users' input in the terminal) within the execution of Node B that is launched by users in the terminal. Is there a ROS way to do this? Or should I just encode a shell command in B's source code to launch A, like executing a shell command in C++ programs?
Thanks,

A:

The usual ROS way is running them both from a roslaunch script.

This will bring up A and B at the beginning, and then B can designed to idle until it is contacted, thus not providing significant overhead.  This also has the advantage that it decreases issues like latency at startup.
