Q:

Mobile robot localization in a known map

I want to localize a mobile robot equipped with a 2D laser scanner in a known indoor environment.  The map is a 2D occupancy grid, but is not perfect.
What algorithms are appropriate for mobile robot localization?

A:

Particle filters or Monte Carlo localization can be used. Basically you distribute a set of points at random across the maps and see which points would have sensor readings most similar to the reading from your map. The best points survive and you create new points and so forth. After some iterations you have a group of points, hopefully, all in the same place on the map as your robot. 
I believe there is a few methods explained in this course.
