Q:

Error while building map with slam

Hi everyone, I was trying to build the environment map with slam and hokuyo on my robot. At first, I can view any image. But some times,there was error:
Error: m_distanceThresholdCheck overridden!!!! *************
m_distanceThresholdCheck=20
Old Odometry Pose= 0.530987 -6.86704 -2.86229e-17
New Odometry Pose (reported from observation)=  22.7237  -20.1116 0.255681
***********************************************************************
** The Odometry has a big jump here. This is probably a bug in the   **
** odometry/laser input. We continue now, but the result is probably **
** crap or can lead to a core dump since the map doesn't fit.... C&G **
***********************************************************************
Laser Pose= 22.7237 -20.1116 0.255681
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
[slam_gmapping-1] process has died [pid 3044, exit code -6, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/gmapping/slam_gmapping __name:=slam_gmapping __log:=/home/shixiaolu/.ros/log/eb024742-a87b-11e5-a7f9-e0db55f0e591/slam_gmapping-1.log].
log file: /home/shixiaolu/.ros/log/eb024742-a87b-11e5-a7f9-e0db55f0e591/slam_gmapping-1*.log

than, it can not continue to build the map. Is it due to the Odometry has a big jump.
Sometimesï¼Œthere was the same error but it can go on build  a map . For For example
Error: m_distanceThresholdCheck overridden!!!! *************
m_distanceThresholdCheck=20
Old Odometry Pose= 0.554374 -3.801 -2.64545e-17

Where do you get your odometry values from?  Does it show any position jumps (in rviz or howeer you can see the values)?

A:

Maybe you ran out of the memory.
