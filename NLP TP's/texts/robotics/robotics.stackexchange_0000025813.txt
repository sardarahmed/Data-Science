Q:

ROS Groovy with Gazebo standalone

@nkoenig has mentioned that in my previous question that I can use standalone Gazebo with ROS Groovy..
So, I am curious how it can be done because I want to use the latest version of Gazebo..
In ROS, I have been launching PR2 in Gazebo by
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_emptyworld.launch

If I want to do the same with Gazebo standalone, how can I have the same thing happen?
Obviously, first I launch Gazebo by simply
gazebo

And then, how do I bring up PR2 and ROS?
Thanks!

A:

EXPERIMENTAL
Checkout this simulator_gazebo hydro branch.
Despite the branch name, build against groovy.
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-urdfdom*

Next, checkout gazebo deprecated_parser_sdf_1.2_support branch and compile.  This has actually been merged with the latest default tip of gazebo.  Set install target to /usr.
cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/opt/ros/groovy/share -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

Lastly, go to the simulator_gazebo groovy overlay, and do a rosmake.
