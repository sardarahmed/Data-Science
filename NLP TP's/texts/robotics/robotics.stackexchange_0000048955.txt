Q:

Rosws (ROS CVS) Tutorials link is broken?

Hello everyone,
I just wanted to point out that the link to the rosws tutorials are broken in these websites:

ROS > /wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
ROS > /wiki/rosws

The link that does not work is:

ROS > /doc/api/rosinstall/html/rosws_tutorial.html

I have tried to find the correct link to the tutorial, but I have had no success.
I do not know what to do about it (I am starting to use ROS), so I decided to post this question. Sorry for the cryptic webpage links, I do not have enough karma to post them.
Thanks!

A:

In the rosws wiki page I found this link referring to the documentation for the "new rosws" in the "Documentation" section. Browsing the docs I found this page which seems to be the equivalent to what you were looking for.
