Q:

Installing libgazebo_ros_moveit_planning_scene.so

Tried

sudo apt install ros-noetic-gazebo*

sudo apt install ros-noetic-moveit*

I assume libgazebo_ros_moveit_planning_scene.so would live in /opt/ros/noetic/lib.
I need this lib to publish a world scene (basically a robot workcell) from gazebo for moveit to use in collision detection/path planning for a robot within a workcell.
Does anyone know where the library is located/how it is installed?

@osilva Thanks for the PR link. I have submitted a similar PR for the noetic branch.
