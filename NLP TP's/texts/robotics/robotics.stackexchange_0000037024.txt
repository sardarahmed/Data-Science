Q:

Publishers and Subscribers in ros

Hi,
I have created a package in my ros_workspace(directory),and I have tried to write a simple publisher into the "Codeblocks" software, in the package directory, but it seems that the software cannot compile the program at all because it cannot find the headers needed. Although, the headers exist, I found them and add the paths to the program, but there are lots of them, I can't everytime add 10 or more paths for a publisher only. Does the fact that I did not create beginner_tutorials package with turtle node and all that first, matters?is something in those files needed?
