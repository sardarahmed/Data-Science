Q:

build ros2 with c++11

I have a project written in c++11.
I would like to integrate a ros2 node in it.
Is there a way to build ros2 code with the c++11 flag instead of the c++14 one ?
Thank you

A:

No, ROS 2 relies on C++14 features, so it must be built with a compiler that supports C++14 and has it enabled (e.g. with --std=c++14 or --std=gnu++14).
If you project builds with C++11 but your compiler supports C++14, then you can likely just build your C++11 based project with C++14 turned on and be fine.
