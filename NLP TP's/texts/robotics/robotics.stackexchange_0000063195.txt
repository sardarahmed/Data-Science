Q:

Distance of a Robot to Obstacles in a Known Environment

I know this is not a trivial question, but Is there a way in ROS to compute the distance of a robot to the closest obstacle in a known environment.
Thanks

A:

Right now, the inflation layer has functionality to figure out how far any point in the costmap is from the closest obstacle. It could extended to just output the distance. This might be the best approach, depending on what kind of application you're looking for.
