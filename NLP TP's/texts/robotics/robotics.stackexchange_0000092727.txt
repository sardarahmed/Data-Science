Q:

Load TurtleBot3 on Rviz

I'm trying to launch turtlebot3_bringup and turtlebot3_remote on PC with this command line:
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch

The result:
[turtlebot3_remote.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot3_bringup] nor is [turtlebot3_bringup] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

What can I do?

Are you sure you are running the command in the host where you have run roscore?

I have not worked in the workspace. I managed to solve the problem. Thank you for the help!

A:

I solved it. Before opening a new terminal to write: $ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch , go in your workspace and add source, in my case:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
