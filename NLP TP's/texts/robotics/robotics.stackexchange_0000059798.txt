Q:

SRDF and group_state

Dear all,
I'm trying to start up in Gazebo my arm manipulator with a fixed configuration. In order to, I have created an SRDF file, with a group for the arm, and a group_state with the homing position. However I don't know how to active this homing position. Could anybody help me?
Thanks in advance
Ane

A:

If your project involves creating a 3D model file to realize your robot on Gazebo, you should better use the model format SDF that Gazebo works the best with.
I doubt if Gazebo works with SRDF, which was invented to compensate semantic context of a robot in URDF format.
