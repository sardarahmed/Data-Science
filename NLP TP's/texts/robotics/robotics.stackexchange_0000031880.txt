Q:

rosbag keyboard controls unresponsive

I have been using rosbag play to test some CPU-intensive computer vision algorithms on recorded data. Periodically during playback the command-line interface to rosbag play becomes completely unresponsive: the timer stops counting and it is no longer responsive to keyboard controls. Messages are still being published while it is unresponsive (verified with rostopic hz and image_view). If I play the same data back without the CPU-intensive nodes running, everything is fine.
Stepping through the data is important for evaluating my nodes, so this has been very frustrating. Has anyone found a workaround for this problem?

Im getting the same behavior, but I have noticed that (for me at least), /clock is no longer being published, even though the actual data messages are. Since /clock is so important, I am a bit surprised at this.

Hi,
I will offer some observations I made when I was playing back and processing bags with Kinect data, which may or may not fix your issue.
First, try tweaking the --rate and --queue parameters.
Second, try loading the bag using rxbag, and playing it from there, instead of the command line. Using rxbag, I was able to get better system performance than rosbag play. Also I think it gives you better control over the playback - like starting at specific times or stepping through frame by frame.
Hope this helps,
Ivan

Using the --rate options with a fractional rate fixed the problem. Thanks!
