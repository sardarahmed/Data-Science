Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS on Windows

Hi all,
I would like to run a very thin client on windows. It is supposed to be only a message sender. I found this link on ROS web site. http://www.ros.org/wiki/cturtle/Installation/Windows
It asks me to install roslib and rospy on my windows client. The question is how it is possible. Is there any binary file that I install it on my windows, or I have to install them from their source codes? They have dependencies to other packages. What should I do with them?
Bests,
Shams

Now that Fuerte is released, this should be easier, but I don't know how to do it.

A:

Update
It is possible to install and use ROS Lunar on Windows 10 thanks to WSL:

This is the best way to use ROS on Windows right now, though it is not perfect.

Please see the more recent Fuerte-era ROS Windows instructions.  ROS on Windows is a work in progress, and you should always use the most recent release.

I believe it's important to recognise that ROSonWSL is not the same as having a native Win32/64 ROS. WSL does not have the same level of access to Windows resources, so 'driver' components wanting to access hw (usb, gpus for gpgpu fi) will not work (easily).
