Q:

Is there a 3rd-party buildfarm for pre-release tests?

Hi,
As the ROS buildfarm does not perform pre-release tests anymore (see http://answers.ros.org/question/219500/no-more-prerelease-test-on-the-buildfarm/ ), I tried to setup a  virtual maschine with docker to run the tests locally. Unfortunately I have a 32-bit system and docker requires a 64-bit system. I'd like to avoid reinstalling my whole system just to run the tests.
So: Is there any 3rd-party buildfarm/cloud/server/host where I can run the tests on?
Regards,
Sabrina

A:

I'm not aware of anyone running that as a service. You could probably rig up a travis build to do this for you, or launch a 64 bit VM in with a cloud provider.

Ok, thank you. We were thinking about a cloud provider, too. But in the meantime I have a 64-bit system and I did the tests on this machine.
