Q:

Can you use python 3 with ROS Kinetic?

I hear that it isn't supported according to this question: http://answers.ros.org/question/237613/how-to-define-ros-kinetic-to-use-python3-instead-of-python27/.
However, can anyone be more specific as to which parts of ROS will not work and how crucial/useful they are?
Thanks.

A:

Unless someone has explicitly tested ROS Kinetic with Python 3, you won't find a list of known compatibility problems.
roscore and most of the command line tools are written in Python, so there are lots of places where brokenness may be a big problem.
