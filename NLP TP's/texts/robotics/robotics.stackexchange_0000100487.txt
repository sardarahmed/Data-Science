Q:

Turtlebot3 description not found

Had issues with my ROS since some packages were deleted (https://answers.ros.org/question/390335/python3-rosdep2-install-broke-ros/), so tried re-installing. Now I'm getting this error:
Resource not found: turtlebot3_description
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/noetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/roshan/Documents/ROS/turtlebot_test/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/noetic/share
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

And looking through the files in the /opt/ros/noetic/share, there is no turtlebot3_description. Have done

source devel/setup.bash

, still getting the error. Have also tried reinstalling the turtlebot3_simulations package in my workspace and catkin_make, still getting the issue

A:

Had to manually install this package, which is weird since it used to come automatically when installing ROS Noetic or turtlebot3 sim
