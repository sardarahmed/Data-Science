Is missing, in a new workspace or in /opt/ros/hydro?

Check your catkin workspace for this file.

A:

If you are referring to the /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash file being missing then you might have only some ROS hydro pakcages installed but not some of the low level packages. Try to install the ROS base packages:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-ros-base
