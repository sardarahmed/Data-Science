I suggest to take a look at the wiki/IDEs page.

A:

I personally use VS Code and I am happy with it. Note that you need to install a few of extensions and clang for auto complete to be working properly.
C/C++ Clang Command Adapter

can be installed freely from market place of VS Code. You also need to create a .vscode folder under root folder of your project, which will have proper setting files, as an example you can refer to link below and adjust the oaths according to your system,

Hello, thank you. I edited the "c_cpp_properties.json" fiile as you suggested and replaced your "/home/atas/catkin_ws/src/ROS_Raw_Kitti_Player/kitti_ros/include" by my ws "/home/fele/catkin_ws/src/basics/include"
and other all in the path [ ] and it works now!!! thanks
