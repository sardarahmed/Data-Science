Q:

'catkin build' gives 'command not found

I have ROS Indigo Desktop Full installed from binaries on Ubuntu 14.04.2.
I've been reading about the catkin make system, and am lead to believe there are 3 variations:

catkin_make
catkin_make_isolated, and
catkin build

I'm familiar with the first two and have used them for my projects, but I would like to make use of catkin build but I get an error catkin: command not found. There is no catkin script or executable in the /opt/ros/indigo/ folder structure.
What could be going wrong?  Is there something else I need to install?
Cheers,
Nap.

A:

The catkin build command is part of the catkin_tools package. On apt-get the package is called python-catkin-tools.
The documentation for the package can be found here: http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
Since the package was officially released, I have completely stopped using catkin_make. It is a great package!

I issued this command in the terminal, and it worked:
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools 

Thank you!

The command that solved it for me was:
sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-tools

I was missing the python3 specification.

This is the error that shows up while running the "sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-tools" command.
how do I solve it?

It has been ages, but for someone else also looking for the answer:
https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html
First you need to add the repositories and then do apt install.
