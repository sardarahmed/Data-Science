Q:

cannot run roscore due to error in rosversion

When running roscore with a new groovy install, i get this error:

It's recommended that you use the 'rosclean' command.

A:

This is caused by having a previously-installed "pip" version of rospkg which is out of date.
Fix this by:
sudo pip uninstall rospkg
repeat this until it says "not found"
then to be sure you have the latest:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-rospkg
The "pip uninstall" version is supposed to work, but personally I did:
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/catkin*
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ros*
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/ros*
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/catkin*
to remove the old pip-installed versions.  This should be safe for both Fuerte and Groovy users, because these tools are all now installed to /usr/ instead of /usr/local and are available as debian packages.

Thanks this really helped me out.

Worked for me as well for Indigo, I had an old Fuerte installed. But I didn't had to do the last steps with sudo rm.
