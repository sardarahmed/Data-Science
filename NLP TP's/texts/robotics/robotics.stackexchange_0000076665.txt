Q:

Bump Sensors on Simulated TurtletBot in kinetic

Can anyone get a reading from the bump sensors on a simulated turtlebot in Gazebo on kinetic?
I have 4 terminals open.
1) $ roscore 

2) $ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch   # run Gazebo simulation

3) $ rostopic pub -r 10 /mobile_base/commands/veloty geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x:0.2}}'    # move the turtlebot forward

4) $ rostopic echo /mobile_base/events/bumper   # display any bumper messages

When the bot runs into an obstacle, and the bump sensor should be pressed, I'm getting no output in terminal 4.
Can anyone confirm a different result or explain why there aren't any bumper messages?
I suspect this is not a problem on indigo.
Thanks a lot.
Rob

A:

I have the same problem. I cannot seem to get anything published on the bumper topic (ROS Kinetic @ 16.04, everything from packages) I have given up for now but if you are interested in pursuing this further, here is some information.

The bumper messages are sent by a gazebo plugin called gazebo_ros_kobuki. You can find where it is included in the file kobuki_gazebo.urdf.xacro. Here is that file's source: https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki_description/blob/master/urdf/kobuki_gazebo.urdf.xacro

The source code for the plugin is here: https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki_desktop/tree/kinetic/kobuki_gazebo_plugins. Recent commit history: https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki_desktop/commits/kinetic/kobuki_gazebo_plugins

I cannot easily see the problem and don't have time to set this up this right now for debugging so my answer can be a bit unsatisfying.

Yes, thanks. I've given up too - for the time being I'm using the laser sensor at close range to develop my algorithm.
It seems to me that the biggest clue here is that others are reporting  a bump sensor can be read straightforwardly in versions of ROS prior to kinetic. What could have changed?
