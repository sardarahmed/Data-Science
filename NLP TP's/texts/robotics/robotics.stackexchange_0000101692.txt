Q:

[ROS2] Service call keeps waiting for the service to be available

Using ubuntu 20.04 + ROS2 foxy
I am trying to call a service from mavros package with ros2, but it gets stuck in waiting for service to become available...
I am pretty the service is available. I can see it with ros2 service list.
Is this a bug with ros2? foxy? I saw some issues on github about people complaining about bugs depending on the DDS, can this be related?
service call:
ros2 service call /mavros/cmd/arming mavros_msgs/srv/CommandBool '{value: True}'
waiting for service to become available...

ros2 service list:
ros2 service list -t | grep cmd
/mavros/cmd/arming [mavros_msgs/srv/CommandBool]
/mavros/cmd/command [mavros_msgs/srv/CommandLong]
