Q:

Minimal ROS2 Installation

Is there a repo file available that produces a minimal ROS2 installation similar to ros-base from ROS1?

A:

The repos file is an artifact of our development process from before ROS2 distros existed. You can get what you want using the rosinstall_generator just like you can with ROS 1 distros. e.g.
Release tags:
rosinstall_generator --deps --rosdistro dashing ros_base

Upstream tags:
rosinstall_generator --deps --upstream --rosdistro dashing ros_base

Upstream devel branches
rosinstall_generator --deps --upstream-devel --rosdistro dashing ros_base

For faster checkouts you don't plan to edit you can use the tarballs option.

Awesome.  I didn't even think to try the old setup.  Thanks.

Looking for the same thing as OP.  I've been following the ROS 2 build guide here: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Eloquent/Linux-Development-Setup/
For a minimal install, I should run rosinstall_generator prior to the colcon build command, correct?

You should replace the wget of the 'ros2.repos' file with the rosinstall_generator command.

How big should the ros_base download be? I tried this with foxy and it downloaded >800 MB of source repos.

That's a little higher than I'd expect. If you check out the tarballs with just the latest checkout I see 124MB. Dependeing on what packages you're pulling the repositories from you can have a good amount of historical versions included in the default clone of the repositories, especially the release repositories which are not optimized for minimal git clones.
