Q:

How do you start to play a bag paused?

I am playing a rosbag through a launch file (that also contains a python script and rviz) and it works fine.
However, rosbag play starts to run after some time  (of course). I can pause it by pressing the space bar and reinitiate again. Great.
My question is, is there a way to specify that the playing of the rosbag should start paused? (and wait for my space bar pressing)

A:

Found the answer!
use --pause
<launch>
   <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag_play" output="screen" required="true"
         args="--pause /opt/robomaker/datasources/mybaggroup_1/myS3prefix/log_0.bag"/>
</launch>
