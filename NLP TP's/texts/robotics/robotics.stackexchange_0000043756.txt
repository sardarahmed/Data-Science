Q:

How to enter multi-line code in our questions?

Hi All,
For me, it seems that the tool for entering code (available on the toolbar above our ros-answer-question editor) only works for one-line code; we have to click the tool again for a new line.
How if we want to enter multi-line code?
Let's say, I want to copy-paste a chunk of code.
What is the trick, guys, please?
Thank you.

Indent by 4 characters the whole mulitline block of code and it will be highlighted.

A:

You can first paste the whole (multiline) code snippet, mark it afterwards and then click on the < code > icon. This should have the requested effect.

I think the editing window has changed. I don't see an < code > icon. Markdown syntax of three backticks before and after the code doesn't seem to work for multiline blocks. What's the right way?

@dinosaur: the syntax for displaying blocks of code is just to indent by 4 spaces.
Alternatively, select any number of lines and click the < code > button, which is the one with '101 010'.
