Q:

What does "6 degrees of freedom" mean?

I am looking at this page that describes various characteristics of gyroscopes and accelerometers. Close to the end (where they speak about IMUs), the names of the items have something like this:

9 degrees of freedom
6 degrees of freedom

Can anyone explain what does this mean?

A:

Most "meters" of all varieties include up to three degrees of freedom simply to observe all three dimensions of reality we find ourselves in.
That said, every object in our three space has three additional dimensions of rotation.  Therefore an unconstrained object is typically said to have six degrees of freedom.
I had to search nine to understand.  Apparently, magnetometers are somehow considered a third set of dimensions, which to me is odd marketing.
