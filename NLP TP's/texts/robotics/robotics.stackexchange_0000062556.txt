Q:

Visualize inertia

Hi all,
Do you know if there is a way to visualize the inertia of the different links of a urdf? Something like RViz or gazebo displaying the inertia ellipsoid centered on the center of mass...
I could not find anything relevant. Any idea?
Thanks,
Antoine

A:

You can actually visualize the inertia under the shape of a box (rather than an ellipsoid - but really who cares) starting from ROS-Indigo / Gazebo 2.2 (you may actually visualize it with an earlier version of Gazebo but there is no ROS version associated).
ROS-Hydro / Gazebo 1.9 does not allow to visualize inertia...
