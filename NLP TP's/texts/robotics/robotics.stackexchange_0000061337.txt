Q:

problem in installing hydro

Hai,

I am new to linux and ROS. I am using 12.04 (32 bit) in a 64 bit machine. I tried to install ros-hydro package. After fetching (sudo apt-get install) 90-95% package, download stops by giving an error:

unable to fetch some archives maybe run apt-get update or try with fix-missing
Earlier, I installed same package in a 32 bit machine without any error.

Links that are failed to open  in terminal window are accessible through web browser in UBUNTU O.S.

I am accessing internet through co-axial cable modem (does n't have any proxy  settings)

Thanks,
kota

A:

It's possible that you hit the repository at a bad time.
Try running sudo apt-get update and then retrying your installation.

I've had trouble a couple times in the last week accessing all the ubuntu repositories. It's unusual but does happen sometimes.
