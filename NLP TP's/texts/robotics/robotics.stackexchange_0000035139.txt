Q:

cannot install ros-electric-desktop-full right now

I cannot install ros-electric-desktop-full at the moment. I am not sure that whether the repo now invalid or some thing wrong with me. The result I got are many unmet dependencies, but when I go to the repo by the web browser they still be there! Can anyone tell me what am I supposed to do please.

Please provide more information about what architecture and OS you are running.

A:

What OS and repo are you using? Please quote your sources.lists and show the console output of your problems.  If you don't provide more information we can't help you, please see the support guidelines at http://www.ros.org/wiki/Support
Based on your outputs it looks like you're using lucid.
http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-amd64/Packages shows consistent versions of opencv.  As does http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-i386/Packages
