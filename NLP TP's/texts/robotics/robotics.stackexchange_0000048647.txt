Q:

converting optical frame to base frame tf

I'm trying to transform an optical frame -> x=right, y=down, z=forward to a base frame with the orientation -> x=forward, y=left, z=up.
I attempted to try the translation in a tf broadcaster, but was unsuccessful. Any ideas?
System:Ubuntu, Fuerte, Precise

You need to be more specific about what you mean by unsuccessful. Check out the launch file kinect_frames.launch file in openni_launch package for an example of how to do exactly what you are asking here

A:

What exactly did not work with the tf broadcaster? If the origin is supposed to stay the same, all you need to do is find the right rotation between the frames and broadcast like so:
tf::TransformBroadcaster br;
tf::Transform transform;
transform.setOrigin( tf::Vector3(0,0,0)); 
transform.setRotation( tf::Quaternion(x,y,z,w) ); 
br.sendTransform(tf::StampedTransform(transform, ros::Time::now(), "optical", "base_link"));

Thanks, I was on the right track...I just wasn't sending the right angles.
