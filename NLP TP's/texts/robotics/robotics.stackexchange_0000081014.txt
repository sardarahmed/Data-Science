Q:

Depending on unreleased versions of packages

Suppose I have a package A that has been released using bloom, and I am developing a package B that depends on A. Then, I add new functionality to A, and B makes use of this new functionality. If I release A but it has not made it to the public Debian repository yet, will package B successfully build on the build farm?
That is, does the build farm build packages by getting dependencies from the public repository? Or does it get the latest released versions of the dependencies?

A:

Yes. The build farm uses the latest released version of a package when building binaries.
"dev" and "pr" jobs, however, will pull from the testing repository I believe, which will be more up-to-date than "public" but still will lag slightly behind the repository the build farm uses for binaries.
