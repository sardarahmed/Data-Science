Q:

rosdep is not working in my ubuntu 11.10

Tutorial link: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
while I run
rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials
I got the following error
ImportError: No module named rospack
ImportError: No module named rospack
[rospack] Error: could not find python module 'rosdep2.rospack'. is rosdep up-to-date (at least 0.10.4)?
How can I tackle this problem

Can you check rosdep --version and which rosdep?
Comment by unais on 2013-03-07:
rosdep version is  -    0.9.3
which rosdep:  - /usr/local/bin/rosdep

A:

You have an old rosdep installed.
Uninstall/Remove the rosdep version in /usr/local/bin and
install the package python-rosdep.

@dornhege I am encountering the same problem. I have removed rosdep from /usr/local/bin and reinstalled via "sudo apt-get install python-rosdep" but still I am encountering the same problem
