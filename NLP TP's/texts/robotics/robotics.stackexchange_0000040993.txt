A:

If you do it correctly, nothing. However, using roscreate-pkg is easier, and you'll be a lot less likely to make a mistake.
What you want to be really careful of is creating a package by copying files from an existing one ... its tempting, but tends to cause obnoxious problems.
For more details, see the roscreate wiki page
