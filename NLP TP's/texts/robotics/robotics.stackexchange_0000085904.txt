Q:

Running ROS in a Tensorflow virtual environment

I run Tensorflow in a virtual environment and I want to run a python node in this virtual environment. I'm getting an error saying:
ImportError: No module named 'rospkg'

I've tried running source ./devel/setup.bash but that didn't help solve the problem.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve this problem?
Thanks in advance.
