Q:

After changing a links Inertial values dynamically, its behavior does not change

Hi,
I am using Gazebo 1.8.0. In a plugin I am changing the Inertial values of some links, even though the values change, their behavior stays the same in the simulation.
Do I have to re-load them somehow?
Here is the code snippet how I set the values:
this->link->GetInertial()->SetInertiaMatrix(new_inertia, new_inertia, new_inertia, 0, 0, 0);

Thanks,
Andrei

A:

After calling Link::SetInertiaMatrix, you'll need to call Link::UpdateMass. This is implemented for ODE, but not yet for bullet.
