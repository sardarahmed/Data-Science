Q:

ROS2 Foxy slam_toolbox crashes trying to load libconsole_bridge.so.1.0

OS:
Ubuntu 20.04
ROS2 Installation:
Ros2 Foxy through ros-foxy-desktop
Problem:
Im trying to test slam_toolbox through its binary install(sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-slam-toolbox) with my RPLidar A1, but if I try to execute the launch file online_async_launch.py through ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py
, it crashes with the error:
error while loading shared libraries: libconsole_bridge.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[ERROR] [async_slam_toolbox_node-1]: process has died [pid 24195, exit code 127, cmd '/opt/ros/foxy/lib/slam_toolbox/async_slam_toolbox_node --ros-args -r __node:=slam_toolbox --params-file /opt/ros/foxy/share/slam_toolbox/config/mapper_params_online_async.yaml --params-file /tmp/launch_params_nr3o0zlj'].

apt-get says "Unable to locate package libconsole_bridge.so.1.0", it seems to be apart of the ros console_bridge package, but sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-console-bridge is also unable to locate the package.
Is there a place where I can install this from source? Or did I install something wrong.

A:

Ok, I installed the binaries to make sure they're not busted (cough maybe I should have been doing that for a while instead of only building source cough). Things look good on my end, I just did an apt install of slam toolbox from binaries, sourced my /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash in a clean terminal and I don't get a crash.
ros-foxy-console-bridge you are right isn't a package, but ros-foxy-console-bridge-vendor is. That's what's getting your right vendor for your OS. Try installing that and potentially doing an sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade to get updates in case your local lists are old.
