Q:

Using C++ to control a drone

I am relatively new to using drones and was wondering if someone more experienced in the topic could lend a hand. I am familiar with C++ and OpenCV, a facial recognition software that has libraries in C++. I would like to be able to use the software to control the drone (engaging it/turning off or on. Flight patterns would be a plus). 
In other words I need someone to point me in the right direction to finding the right materials so that my C++ code can control the drone. If anyone can point me to the reading materials or specific drones to purchase I would be extremely grateful.
Note, I used quadcopter as a tag because I did not have enough reputation to use drone

A:

You could use ROS. There's  AR Drone Autonomy for well.. Parrot AR-Drones. 
TUM ARDrone from the Technical University of Munich, who used that with OpenCV to control a drone.
You can simulate a drone using Hector.
Or simply search google for quadcopter ROS
