Q:

Drifting problem in Hector_mapping

Hi guys!
Recently, I tried using the hector_slam package for mapping. The Laser which I am using is Hokuyo LiDAR UTM-30LX.

A:

Do you have an IMU in your UAV? hector_slam works well without it (the IMU) as long as you maintain it levelled with the floor. You can make an experiment and move the laser with your hand while tilting it, in an attempt of reproducing the motion of your UAV, to see how good your map becomes...
