Q:

How to visualize PointCloud2 in rviz

I have a BAG file, XXX.bag
I started roscore and rosbag play XXX.bag. Then I opened rviz.
I added a PointCloud2
But I got an error
Transform[sender=unknow] For frame [velodyne] fixed frame [map] doesn't exist
My global options has fixed frame map
I am new to ROS. I don't understand any of these error messages.

A:

The problem is that you have left the fixed frame to map. RViz doesn't know where to place the point cloud, since the map -> velodyne transform doesn't exist. So, either use the static_transform_publisher in tf to publish that transform, or just change the frame in rviz to velodyne.
