Q:

How to make the Turtlebot rotate in place a set # of degrees/radians

I looked at the geometry_msgs::Twist class but that allows you to only set the velocity of a turn.  I want to make the turtlebot slowly rotate in place a set number of radians/degrees on command.
Thanks!

A:

Keep sending a Twist messages with your desired yaw rate (angular.z in radians/sec) until it reaches the desired heading. Then, start sending Twist with a zero yaw rate.

Thanks this worked out!

I have the same question. I wonder if it's possible to send the desired radian/degree as a parameter to the programme? So that when I run the script it automatically rotates a desired degree.

Maybe I didn't get your advice right, but how do I fixate the moment it reached the desired heading given that I set only the velocity?

You need some feedback, probably from an Odometry message.

Thank you! I will try that.
