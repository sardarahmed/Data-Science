A:

Your post seems more like an announcement or call-for attention, which suits better in the general mailing list. I'd recommend to post there once, then move the discussion to somewhere more specific (the ros-users mailing list is only an entry point, may not be for elaborated discussions).
If you're thinking of educational projects that goes beyond an entry level working group, there's a special interest group for educational purposes.

Many tutorials, on/off ROS site, are available.
