Q:

Continued: Installing on Mac Sierra: qt_gui_cpp_sip errors

It's turning out to be really important for me to try and get ROS installed on Mac even though I realize its not a supported platform (yet). I've made it through lots of hurdles and learned more about python and packages and macOS and ROS than I ever thought possible!
This command fails:
bash-3.2$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

And at the end of the log it gives me this command to reproduce the problem. Here's the output:
cd /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/qt_gui_cpp && /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j8 -l8

A:

This issue is described in the installation docs in section 4.3: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source
You should manually create this link:
ln -s /usr/local/share/sip/Qt5 /usr/local/share/sip/PyQt5

Also check out my gist of successful ROS installation on macOS Sierra for solutions to further problems. I hope it helps somewhat.
