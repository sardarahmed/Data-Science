Q:

Nodelet won't initialize in different manager

Hi,
I have the following problem. I've created a nodelet and it runs fine, when I load it in a manager I created just for this nodelet. However when I try to load it into different manager that is in the system, the onInit() just won't get called.
What can be the possible causes of this problem? I have a suspicion that some other nodelet under the manager has blocking onInit() is it possible? Can I somehow list which nodelets run under the given manager?

A:

Problem solved. The output didn't go to the same console I started the nodelet from, but the nodelet was working.
