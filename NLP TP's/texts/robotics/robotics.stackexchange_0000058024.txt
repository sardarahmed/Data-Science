Q:

Error in Building a Visual Robot Model with URDF from Scratch

-In the tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch
when I typed the following command roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/01-myfirst.urdf in the terminal to examine the model, I had the following error
... logging to /home/eman/.ros/log/c7aa09c8-aee6-11e3-82a3-f46d04518b4d/roslaunch-eman-K52F-6478.log

    with open(textfile, 'r') as f:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'urdf/01-myfirst.urdf'

even though,the urdf_tutorial package are found in the following path filesystem/opt/ros/hydro/share and contains the urdf file.
when I tried the command rospack find urdf_tutorial,it returned the package path /opt/ros/hydro/share/urdf_tutorial.
so,it means that ROS can see the package.
So,my question is; What is the cause of this error?? & why does it return "no such file or directory" ??

my distribution is hydro.
I use Ubuntu 12.10.

please,help.
Thanks in advance.

Comment by BennyRe on 2014-03-18:
Did you run roslaunch from within the urdf_tutorial package? Did you run roscd urdf_tutorial before roslaunch?

A:

To extend a little on the answers by @Maya and @BennyRe: the tutorial explicitly tells you that you should either first roscd urdf_tutorials, or always provide the full (absolute) path to the urdf files.
From the tutorial:
# All of the robot models mentioned in this tutorial can be found in the urdf_tutorial package.
[..]
$ roscd urdf_tutorial

and:

This launch file assumes that 01-myfirst.urdf is in the urdf subdirectory of the directory that you type the command in. Otherwise, you should say model:='$(find pkg-name)/urdf/01-myfirst.urdf' where pkg-name is the name of the package that the file is in (single quotes required). All of the example files are in the urdf_tutorial package, so if you are in that directory you can run the commands without modification.

It would appear that your current working directory is not the urdf_tutorial package, hence the launch fails.
