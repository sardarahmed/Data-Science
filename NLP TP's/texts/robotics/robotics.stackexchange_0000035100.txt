Q:

broken packages installing electric full on natty

I'm trying to install ros-electric-ros-full on a natty machine and get:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-electric-ros-full : Depends: ros-electric-rx (= 1.6.1-s1314989513~natty) but 1.6.1-s1314993028~natty is to be installed

Did apt-get update, and tried uninstalling and reinstalling ros-electric-rx to no avail.

A:

The repo is probably being updated.
Wait a while, then try updating and installing again.

Three hours later still having the same issue. Can anyone from Willow confirm that the repo is/was being updated?
