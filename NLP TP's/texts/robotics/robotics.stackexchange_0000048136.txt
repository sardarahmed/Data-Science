Q:

Cannot build Flann

I'm trying to build the newest groovy on my debian testing distro, following the wiki instructions under the ubuntu source pa. ( I got wstool, rospkg and rosdep via Pip btw. not from the ubuntu repos)
I can init my catkinworkspace (even desktop-full), dependencies also complete with a success state.
However when invoking: $ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install
It fails on building flann (and we do kinda need it). the relevant output from the console can be found at the bottom of the message (I can't post my pastebin link? :S)
Unfortunately nothing really useful to me, maybe not all errors are displayed? Anyone got thoughts on it?
Cheers,
Riemer van der Zee

A:

"No such file or directory" seems to cause this, maybe a directory is not created as it should.
But since other users have build groovy from source without running into that error, the origin of the problem is probably either something different about your build environment or that you use a broken version of flann that few other people tried.
