Q:

How to solve dynamics of cardan joint manipulator

We can use the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm to solve the dynamic problems of open chains manipulator, but how about the Cardan-joint manipulator?
For example, if we have one Cardan joint (Universal joint),2 degrees of freedom, like this picture, one is rotate around the z-axis,and another is rotate around the y-axis 
In order to solve the inverse dynamics of this model, my idea is to set the virtual link between $\theta_1$(assume rotation axis is z-axis) and $\theta_2$(rotation around y-axis), and then the problems become open chains, so in forwarding iterations of Newton-Euler Algorithm, the velocity of $\theta_1$ can transfer to the velocity of $\theta_2$ by virtual link, and finally, the wrench of end-effector can be transfer by backward iterations. But the inertia matrix of virtual link is diag([0,0,0,0,0,0]), is my idea correct? 
I didn't know how to transfer the velocity and wrench between $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ in the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm Framework, Or maybe I should use another method to build the dynamics of this model.

A:

In your diagram now, if it were real and "unpaused," your end-effector would drop. I think the trouble you're having with your dynamics is that you're missing a constraint - what holds the end-effector stationary? To illustrate, if the following were a snapshot frozen in time:

And then you "unfroze" time, then the "dynamics" you would see would result in:

The cross, being an unactuated bearing, cannot support a moment. If it weren't for the faces or end-caps colliding with one another, the entire assembly would swing completely down:

This is what I meant when I said the cross moves - you have one joint between the base and the cross, and then you have another joint between the cross and the end-effector cylinder. The complex part here isn't the joint definitions, it's the addition of the constraint. You don't have one pictured here, so I'm not sure what you're expecting is going to hold the end-effector up.
You either need a bearing or support of some kind for the end-effector or you need to actuate the universal/Cardan joint.
