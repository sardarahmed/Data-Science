Q:

Creating a GUI for ROS

Hello,
I am a high school student working on a project to submit to an affiliate competition of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. I am trying to create a graphic user interface for ROS to make it even easier for hobbyists and schools to start working on robotics. I am testing it on a turtlebot. Essentially, it will allow you an area to download libraries as well as control the robot. I want to know how you guys think I should go about this. Is there a way to have a 'click' on the screen translate into a written command for the terminal? Thanks for any help you can give!

A:

Almost all ros command line capabilities are available in ros python APIs like roslib, rospy, rosparam, rosnode, etc. So a good start point could be wxwidget for python.
If you don't want to use the python APIs you can invoke processes through the python os.system method or te subproccess library.

@Pablo Iñigo Blasco : Fully agree with you, I would have started with wx python or probably pygame

I would suggest using Qt instead (there's also PyQt). It has a nicer API and afaik most wx code in ROS is being ported to Qt (or at least it is planned to).

I second this, since wxWidgets is already in ROS (C++ at least), so less dependencies. Also, I like wxWidgets :)
