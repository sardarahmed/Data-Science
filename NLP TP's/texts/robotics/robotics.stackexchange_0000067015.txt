Q:

There is no move_base node in move_base package

Hi!
I am trying to launch move_base, but I am getting such messages:

when launching it through launch file:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [move_base/move_base]: can't locate node [move_base] in package [move_base]
when launching it by rosrun:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named move_base below /opt/ros/indigo/share/move_base
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /opt/ros/indigo/share/move_base

The system sees the package move_base, but there is no nodes in it. Other packages and nodes of navigation stack work fine. I use Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine with ROS Indigo. I installed navigation stack with sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation. My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is /home/viki/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
 I am very new to ROS, so I have no idea what caused the problem. Please, help me!

A:

It's not an answer but comment don't seem to work these days :s. Here are some leads to explore:
Can you see move base in the list when you run ls /opt/ros/indigo/lib/move_base/ ?
If not, this means that move base has not been properly installed. So try:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-move-base 
then you should see move base in /opt/ros/indigo/lib/move_base/
If yes, run rospack profile to update you package list and then you can try to run your node move_base again.
Hope this helps,

Thanks for your answer! I can see move base in those folders. Actually, I fixed the problem, it was in the wrong settings in catkin workspace. After I reset the workspace and modified ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, all was working

hello! I met the same problem, can you tell me, what exactly do you do?

Actually, I do not remember exactly what I did. After that problem I reinstalled Ubuntu several times on different machines and I never got this problem again. I think, that you should look at setting catkin workspace tutorial on roswiki

I had a similar problem where move_base was not installed (if in doubt type "rospack find move_base" into terminal and it should return the file path if its installed). Running "sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-move-base" fixed the problem for me.
