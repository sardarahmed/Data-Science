Q:

Eclipse ROS fuerte

Hi guys,
I did exactly as described here
http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs
to import my ROS package to Eclipse.
It compiles and runs without problems using the shell,
but when using "Build Project" in Eclipse I only get:
/usr/bin/make all  
rospack: error while loading shared libraries: librospack.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory 
Makefile:1: /cmake.mk: No such file or directory 
make: *** No rule to make target `/cmake.mk'.  Stop.

I don't see where the problem is.
I checked the environment variables and they are fine.
Cheers,
Andreas

A:

When starting eclipse from the shell it worked.
Otherwise it seemed to ignore the environment variables.

It makes sense as bash environment provides required environment varibles. It always works. The problem sometimes we face are indexer problems because indexer could not get the path to header files.  This is easily resolved by adding path to relevant libraries.

it also worked for me, by launching from a terminal shell, but only on FUERTE projects, any ideas why?

I am still using diamondback and electric variants. The procedure always work fine for me. I can not offer justification  for "why only for FUERTE projects  ...". Also I had still not installed FUERTE, so my system still holds good for packages belonging to diamondback and electric variants.
