A:

As far as I know, all that exists is the docs on the wiki (http://ros.org/wiki/ar_pose). A somewhat related, but not exactly ar_pose tutorial, is one I built around ar_kinect some time ago: http://ros.org/wiki/mini_max/Tutorials/Grasping%20an%20Object (note, that tutorial is quite old and the code might have changed).
