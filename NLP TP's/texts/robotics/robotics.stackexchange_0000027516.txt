Q:

Human Model, do we have one in GAZEBO?

Hi all
Is there a HUMAN model in GAZEBO?
I don't need it to be move-able, just a human model. Either in URDF or SDF is fine.
Thank you
Candy

there's one in https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/348b3de008a00cc7b73ad95ad1b8ce00c9d22024/worlds/actor.world?at=default

A:

There's no human model in the database yet. You can always use your own model if you have the COLLADA or STL meshes.
Also note that there's currently a pull request to gazebo_models to add couple of human models without joints to the database.
