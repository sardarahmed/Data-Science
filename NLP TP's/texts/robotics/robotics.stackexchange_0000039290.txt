Q:

Any successful examples of rosdep python-qt-bindings on Electric?

I can't figure out how to use a rosdep for python-qt-bindings in Electric on Ubuntu Oneiric.
It works in Fuerte. I define a compatible rosdep.yaml stanza as follows:
 python-qt-bindings:
   ubuntu:
     lucid:
       apt:
         packages: [python-qt4, python-qt4-dev, python-sip-dev, python-qt4-gl]
     oneiric:
       apt:
         packages: [python-pyside.qtcore, python-pyside.qtgui, libpyside-dev, libshiboken-dev, shiboken, libgenrunner-dev, python-qt4, python-qt4-dev, python-sip-dev, python-qt4-gl]

The install appears to work, then fails at the end:
$ rosdep install art_teleop
Executing script below with cwd=/tmp
{{{
#!/bin/bash
#Packages ['python-pyside.qtcore python-pyside.qtgui libpyside-dev libshiboken-dev shiboken libgenrunner-dev python-qt4 python-qt4-dev python-sip-dev python-qt4-gl']
sudo apt-get install python-pyside.qtcore python-pyside.qtgui libpyside-dev libshiboken-dev shiboken libgenrunner-dev python-qt4 python-qt4-dev python-sip-dev python-qt4-gl
}}}

A:

Probably hard to tell w/o throwing more instrumentation into the code, but probably a bug.  A little surprising as the detection code in rosdep 2 is a pretty direct port of the Electric code.  The detection code runs " dpkg-query -W -f='${Package} ${Status}\n' " and simply parses the output.

OK. I'll open a defect ticket and we can pursue it there: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3914
