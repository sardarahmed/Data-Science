Q:

ROS serial communication with microcontroller

I am newbie to ROS and I want to send Odometry data from P89V51RD2 controller to ROS. I found link: text , but I am not able to run it .. Can someone help out with same code , right from creating packages and meeting dependencies..
Thanks..

I want to send the 'x' 'y' 'z' coordinates as (char) from uC to ROS ..

I presume you're referring to http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosserial. Could you provide some background into what problems you're having?

Hmm. I am referring to the code in the link .. I just found out that it is working, but it is taking 30 seconds or more to receive data.. it takes data for some time  and after few seconds, it publishes all .. is it possible to make it more nearer to real time.. should i change rcvBufSize..?

When i set rcvBufSize to 1, i dont get any true response, it keeps on giving data = ' ' as output to rostopic echo uc0Response.. when i set rcvBufSize to 5 , I get response in group of 4 without loss of any data..but it take more than 20 seconds to show up on the screen..

is it normal to get such slow data fetching and publishing?

A:

It isn't serial specific like rosserial, but rosbridge may also suit your needs (full disclosure, author of rosbridge here). Check out this video of using rosbridge with an Arduino (though the principles apply to any uController).

We tend to recommend rosserial with uCs with Arduino-like specs, and rosbridge for more capable ones (ARM, for instance).
Comment by tjay on 2012-03-21:
Good point. I guess I tend to think the opposite because with less capable uCs I use a machine side adapter program and a light custom protocol. I hate having any sort of real protocol implementation on the uC unless it's beefy. The exception is rosserial on Arduino, because of the good support.
