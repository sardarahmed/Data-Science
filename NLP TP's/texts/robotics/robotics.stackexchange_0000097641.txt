Q:

rviz2 dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libIrrXML.dylib

I've carefully followed the instructions to install ros2 foxy on MacOs (Mohave) and sourced the ~/ros2_foxy/ros2-osx/setup.bash file.
When I run rviz2 I get the following error:
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libIrrXML.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/opt/assimp/lib/libassimp.5.dylib
  Reason: image not found
Abort trap: 6

Could someone assist me in resolving this?  Thank you.

A:

So I had omitted to disable SIP on the Macbook which prevented it from loading the Dynamic Link Libraries.
