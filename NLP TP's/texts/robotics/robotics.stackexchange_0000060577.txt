Q:

Detect open sides of a box

Hey Guys,
I am using a Baxter and ROS Groovy. I am given a box with one side missing. I want to use both the  arm cameras to detect which side is missing and then be able to use the appropriate arm to go in and out of the box.
How can i achieve this task ?

A:

I would recommend that you be specific in asking questions to get the support you need. Are you familair with OpenCV? Start by developing the vision part of the project and detect the missing side. If you have questions, go to OpenCV Answers and ask your OpenCV related questions.

I am basically given a cardboard box with one face missing. I need to figure out a vision based scheme that detects which of the 5 visible faces is missing. I have skimmed through opencv and did not find anything useful.
