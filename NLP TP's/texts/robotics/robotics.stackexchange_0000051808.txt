Q:

Cannot get listener and talker working on two machines

So I have two machines #1 and #2.
I selected #1 as the master by
$ ssh #1
$ roscore

Now I opened a new terminal on #1 and then
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://#1:11311
$ rosrun test1 listener

(Now the terminal is halting, waiting for messages to be posted on the topic)
Now I go on machine #2 and
$ ssh #2
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://#1:11311
$ rosrun test2 talker

(The "Helloworld x" pops up continuously with incrementing x)
When I look at #1, the listener is still halting, I should expect "heard x" with incrementing x. If I try the two nodes on each machine, they work perfectly fine. It is just when I now use two machines.
Btw, they are in the same wireless network and I already check the network setup as in the ROS tutorial.
Could anyone solve my problem? Thanks.

I have the same problem and setting the ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME did not do it for me...

A:

Most probably you forgot to specify ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME environment variables to make it work. From the manual:

With the exception of 'localhost', it
does not affect the actual bound
address as ROS components bind to all
available network interfaces. If the
value is set to localhost, the ROS
component will bind only to the
loopback interface. This will prevent
remote components from being able to
talk to your local component.
