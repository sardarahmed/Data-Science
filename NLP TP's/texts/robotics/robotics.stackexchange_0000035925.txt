Q:

rviz visualization

Hi everybody
I have problems visualizing rviz, I have installed ros in ubuntu 10.04
In one terminal I run roscore and in another terminal I run rosrun rviz rviz and I get
rviz revision number 1.6.7
ogre_tools revision number 1.6.2
compiled against OGRE version 1.7.3 (Cthugha)
Loading general config from [/home/acp/.rviz/config]
Loading display config from [/home/acp/.rviz/display_config]
RTT Preferred Mode is PBuffer.
Texture for pass 0: creating with size 1 x 1
Segmentation fault
Any clue about this segmentation fault?
In advance thank you very much
