Q:

libdc1394 package not available for Diamondback?

Hi,
I am new to ROS and Ubuntu environments... I have been trying to install bumblebee2 package for my system.. but it gives me the following error
      '[rosbuild] Building package bumblebee2
        Failed to invoke /opt/ros/diamondback/ros/bin/rospack deps-manifests bumblebee2
         [rospack] couldn't find dependency [libdc1394v2] of [bumblebee2]
        [rospack] missing dependency' 

I tried to look for the package libdc1394v2 in ROS .. but I couldn't find a valid package that works for Diamondback version...
Does anyone know how I can solve this? Is there another package that I can use instead of libdc1394v2? Or do I have to re-install the C-turtle version of ROS?

A:

The libdc1394v2 package has been deprecated for a very long time. It was long ago replaced by a rosdep dependency on the system version of libdc1394.
If you have a bumblebee driver that depends on libdc1394v2, it is not being actively maintained. You may be able to get it working by converting that <depend> to a <rosdep> in the manifest.xml file. But, I expect you will uncover other problems, beyond that.
There may not be any actively maintained bumblebee driver right now. It probably would not be terribly hard to create one, but a maintainer with access to the device would be necessary.
