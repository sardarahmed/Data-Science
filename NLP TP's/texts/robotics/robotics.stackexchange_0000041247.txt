Q:

How to move through tracked person?

Hi,
I am using Openni tracker for tracking and recognizing user's gesture and i want to move through the tracked person by navigation!(I have transformed its position to the /map frame)
But the tracked person is an obstacle on the map so the navigation goals are aborting!
Is there any way that i can go near the tracked person using navigation ?
Edit:
Finally I solved my problem! i just decreased the x value of tracked human by 0.5 meters and then i sent the new goal to the navigation, and every thing is ok now!

Can you not just put the navigation goal in front of the person? Why does it need to go "through" them... and do you really want to collide with the person, or do you want it to follow a moving person without colliding with him or her?
