Q:

Max motor voltage for RoboClaw controller

The RoboClaw data sheet from ServoCity mentions various current limits, but what about voltage? Can I run a 110 Vdc treadmill motor?

A:

As mentioned on page 7 of the datasheet, 

The main power input can be from 6VDC to 34VDC on a standard RoboClaw and 10.5VDC to 60VDC or 80VDC on an HV (High Voltage) RoboClaw.
