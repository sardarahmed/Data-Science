Q:

Run one node in another node?

The subject looks weird and difficult to understand so I am going to explain what I mean here. I want to know if it is possible to run a node inside another node. For example, when you have written a ROS node A and what you want A to do is to run other several ROS nodes B, C, D and etc. How to implement that? I don't want to use roslaunch to run several nodes in this case because after node A has run other nodes, it also has to do other stuff.
To go further, I want to write a ROS server and what it is supposed to do is waiting for "node request", that is , when a client calls this service, the server tries to run a node instantaneously.  That is to say, how to run nodes in a service server? I think this case is essentially the same as the former one.
Any suggestions are appreciated very much.

A:

How about using nodelets? You can load multiple nodelets in a node at runtime and each nodelet runs in it's own thread.
