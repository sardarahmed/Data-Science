Q:

ImportError: cannot import name CvBridge

Hello,
I am trying to use the cv_bridge package to convert an Image topic to opencv format on Indigo.  I am using the code from the cv_bridge tutorial, and I added cv_bridge to my package manifest as a build_depend, buildtool_depend, and a run_depend.  When I attempt to run the bridge, I am getting the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "cv_bridge.py", line 9, in <module>
    from cv_bridge import CvBridge, CvBridgeError
      File    "/home/kghite/catkin_ws/src/comprobo2014/src/neato_robot/neato_2dnav/scripts/cv_bridge.py", line 9, in        <module>
    from cv_bridge import CvBridge, CvBridgeError
ImportError: cannot import name CvBridge

I would really appreciate any help you can give.  Thanks!

Hi, I'm having the same issue. Did you solve this by any chance?

A:

Solved quite a while back, but hadn't seen the comment above, so:
It actually ended up being that I had named the python script I was writing cv_bridge.py as well, which was messing with the import statement (basically it was trying to import from itself).  I changed the name and everything worked fine!
