Q:

Typo in ROS Wiki Page on Building Packages

Hello,
I found the following line in the ROS Wiki tutorial for building ROS packages [http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages]:

You should see a lot of output from cmake and them make, which should be similar to this:

I think the "them" should be "then", or even totally absent. Am I right? If I so, how do I correct it or any other typo I discover later?
Thank you.

A:

You can sign up for a wiki account and edit the wiki page yourself: http://wiki.ros.org/action/newaccount/Documentation?action=newaccount
In the meantime, I've fixed the typo on that page.

The typo mentioned above was fixed today, but the last edit date of the page is still '2012-12-24 23:17:03'. Could that be and error?

That is not an error. That page includes two other pages, one for the catkin version and one for the older rosbuild version. I only needed to update the catkin version.
