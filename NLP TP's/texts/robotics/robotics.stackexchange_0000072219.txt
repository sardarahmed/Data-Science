Can you provide more information.
Which machine are you running roscore on, have you run roswtf, what does rqtgraph show you when you run it

I have my laptop with ubuntu and raspberry pi with raspbian ..
roscore running on raspberry pi ..
I export ROS_MASTER_URI as pi roscore for my laptop and pi
,when I run talker node on my laptop it run correctly
and a listener node run correctly too on raspberry pi
but it doesn't listen to the talker

I updated my question with the roswtf output

A:

Most probably, you are not setting the ROS_IP (or ROS_HOSTNAME): http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_IP.2BAC8-ROS_HOSTNAME
