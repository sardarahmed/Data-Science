Q:

Using ros common tutorials packages

I have a machine that has the common tutorials package being installed but I'm not sure where it is installed or how can I use those packages.

A:

You can find the tutorials by using rosbash (here's how to navigate the file system). To find out if you have the common_tutorials simply run roscd common_tutorials and if you have it then this will take you to them (/opt/ros/<distrobution>/share/common_tutorials).
You'll find that, however, that package is empty except for the package.xml. So, as @2ROS0 pointed out, just go to /opt/ros/<distrobution>/share/ and look for the actionlib_tutorials, nodelet_tutorial_math, pluginlib_tutorials, and turtle_actionlib folders. They have the actual tutorials.
To use them, just use them as you would any other package.
