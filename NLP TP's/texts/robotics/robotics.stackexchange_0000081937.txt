Q:

Communication Gazebo Ros GPS

Hi! I need help to create a topic for the communication between a gazebo plugin and a ros node. The plugin receives the GPS measures and it should publish on a ros topic the data. The problem is that I have not understood how to make the communication between the plugin and the ros topic. Have you got any idea? Thanks!

A:

Your plugin needs a node handle to publish ROS messages. Here is an example of a GPS plugin for Gazebo.
Especially look at the following lines:
152. node_handle_ = new ros::NodeHandle(namespace_);
153. fix_publisher_ = node_handle_->advertise<sensor_msgs::NavSatFix>(fix_topic_, 10);

236. fix_publisher_.publish(fix_);
