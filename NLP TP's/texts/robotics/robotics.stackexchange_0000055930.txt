Q:

Turtlebot Navigation using simulated turtlebot in gazebo?

I am trying to navigate simulated Turtlebot in gazebo. All tutorials in ros are for real robot. I have already launched turtlebot using
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
Now, I am trying to launch 3Dsensors using
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch
but its giving
started roslaunch server

I am having the same problem. Did you find the solution?
Comment by DPK27 on 2013-12-14:
without launching 3D sensor, by just launching the rviz after turtlebot using
"roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch"
and selecting laser or point cloud you can see the obstacle in front.
So, as I think there is no need of 3dsensor.launch for me, see if it will help you

A:

The turtlebot simulator wont work on groovy. Some people have managed to get it work with tweaks. From the ros wiki only compatibility is with electric, fuerte and hydro at the moment.  I would suggest looking into the hector_turtlebot package, that will work with the groovy. They have a hector_gazebo_simulation for running turtlebot with a hokuyo laser.

I am using hydro only.

Have you installed the turtlebot package along with the simulator?
