Q:

How to combine robot odometry with RGBD SLAM algorithm for mapping?

I use rgbdslam package for building a 3d map and it is successful. Now, I would like to combine the robot odometry with this algorithm for mapping. Is there any possiblity to do this?
If possible, how to do it?
Thanks in advance for the reply.

updated:
Now, I defined the transformation between frames 'odom' and 'openni_camera'. Also, the '/tf' has 'odom' as its initial frame and it is subscribed by package 'rgbdslam'. Even though, I have a doubt that whether 'rgbdslam' will consider it for mapping or not?

A:

Later, I came to know that we have to set the following parameter in launch file - "rgbdslam_sample_config.launch"
param name="config/odom_frame_name"
value="fixed_frame_to_odometry"
