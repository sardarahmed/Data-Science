Q:

RVIZ2 not displaying visuals

I just started learning ROS2 by porting the osrf prius simulation to ROS2 and here i ran into the problem that rviz2 is not displaying the visuals (as seen in the figure)

However when I change the Description Source to File the visuales are displayed (see below)

Any idea how to solve this?
Edit:
I am loading the urdf as follows:
       urdf = os.path.join(
           get_package_share_directory("prius_description"),
           "urdf", urdf_file_name)
       
       Node(
           package="robot_state_publisher",
           executable="robot_state_publisher",
           name="robot_state_publisher",
           namespace="prius",
           output="screen",
           parameters=[{"use_sim_time": use_sim_time, "robot_description": robot_desc}],
           arguments=[urdf]
        ),

A:

Just after editing my question I realized I am using a namespace on the robot_state_publisher. Thus I needed to change the Description Topic in rviz2 to /prius/robot_description to make it work

can you please elaborate on this, as I'm facing the same problem
Comment by GeorgNo on 2023-03-05:
In the case above I needed to change the topic on which to listen for the urdf file.
However, on my current simulation I am facing the problem again and I don't know how to fix it.
If you you find something please inform me, I will do so as well.
