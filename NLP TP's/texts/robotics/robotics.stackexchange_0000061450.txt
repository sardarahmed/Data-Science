Q:

gazebo unable to create glx visual

I install ros hydro and gazebo 1.9. When I run the gazebo command to start simulator it gives error.
Msg Waiting for master
Msg Connected to gazebo master @ http://127.0.0.1:11345
Msg Publicized address: aaa
Error [RenderEngine.cc:641] Unable to create glx visual
Warning [RenderEngine.cc:92] Unable to create X window. Rendering will be disabled

I found several solution like "configure x11" ,but it doesn't help.
How can I fix this problem?
