Q:

How to rostopic pub multiple line for std_msgs/String type topic

How to use rostopic pub to publish multiple line or \n or \r\r for std_msgs/String typed topic.
I tried  as YAML commandLine said. but nothing works.
Thank you!!!

$ rostopic pub /send_BTSVR std_msgs/String  ['test'] --- ['test2'] ---

Usage: rostopic pub /topic type [args...]

rostopic: error: no such option: ---

$ rostopic pub /send_BTSVR std_msgs/String  ['test'] --- ['test2'] ---

Usage: rostopic pub /topic type [args...]

rostopic: error: no such option: ---

A:

Not sure about the approach the wiki describes, but at least in a Bash shell, the following works for me:
$ rostopic pub /send_BTSVR std_msgs/String "data: '\
first line

second line

third line
'"

note the \ after the '. This allows you to continue on the next line.

How is this multiple lines? There are no CR or LF in the topic that is sent. This also doesn't answer how to do \r or \n in a message

Testing this on my ROS Melodic/Ubuntu Bionic install I see this output:
$ rostopic echo /send_BTSVR
data: "first line\nsecond line\nthird line "
---
data: "first line\nsecond line\nthird line "
---
data: "first line\nsecond line\nthird line "

etc.
Afaict, that is a multiline string encoded in a singe std_msgs/String. A Python node subscribing to this with print(msg.data) shows me this:
$ python ./sub.py
first line
second line
third line 
---
first line
second line
third line 
---

etc.
\n==line feed==LF, which is the standard Linux newline.
\r would be something else. I've not checked how to get that in a YAML string, but I would expect it to work the same way (ie: by adding the escape sequence to the string).
Did you expect rostopic echo to also print the multi-line string?
