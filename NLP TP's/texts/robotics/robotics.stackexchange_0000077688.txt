Q:

how to save the published data of a topic for using in matlab

Dear All,
I am using rviz for monitoring the path planning of my mobile robot. It is easily possible to subscribe to a topic and visualize the results data. I wonder how I can save the data of planned path by the planner. I can save topics in a bag file but the problem is that I cannot extract and use them in other software. More clearly, I need to plot this path in Matlab software. Does anybody have any idea how to do it? How do I extract this information from a bag file or Is there any other way to save this data in another format which is usable in Matlab?

A:

The easiest method is probably to convert the data in the bag file to a csv file, have a look at this topic for some suggestions how to do that:

Matlab is capable of loading the csv files and for a description of how one person did that you can even have a look over here:

Good luck

No need to convert to csv if you have the Robotic System Toolbox. See Open and parse rosbag log file.
