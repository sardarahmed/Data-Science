Q:

Best ROS distribution for Universal robot

Hi,
I am starting a project with a UR5 (CB3) from Universal Robot and I would like to use ROS for this.
I have a linux based laptop, with Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
What is the best ROS distribution to work with the Universal Robot packages?
I see that the newest distribution is Noetic, does that mean this is the best to use with the ur5?

Regardless of your question, your choice of OS limits you to ROS Kinetic, as that's the only ROS version supported on Ubuntu Xenial (ie: 16.04). See REP-3: Target Platforms/Platforms by Distribution/Kinetic Kame (May 2016 - May 2021).

Okay thanks. So I have the option to keep Ubuntu Xenial and install ROS Kinetic, or I can upgrade to Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04) and install ROS Noetic. Would u suggest the last option?

Is Melodic on Bionic not an option?

Yes that is also an option, I want to use the best ROS distribution for universal robot. I can reinstall my laptop to get the correct Ubuntu version.

Is Melodic or Boinic a better option for the ur5 (Universal Robots)?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-08-04:
Melodic is the name of a ROS release. Bionic is the name of an Ubuntu release.
You can install Melodic on Bionic, but your question as-is doesn't really have an answer.
I would suggest to install Ubuntu Bionic and then ROS Melodic, to get started.

Oh excuse me I typed 'or'  i.o. 'on'. Thank you, I will install Ubuntu Bionic and ROS Melodic.
