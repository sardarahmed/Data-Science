Q:

Dependencies on user_packages

Hello everyone,
I have in my catkin_ws/src folder two packages, A and B.
Package A depends on package B and joy on build time. I have declared at package.xml of A
<build_depend>B</build_depend>
<build_depend>joy</build_depend>

I would like to use rosdep to have users install joy automatically. However, that means that rosdep will try to download package B as well, and naturally fail.
Is there a way for rosdep to discern user packages and not search for them?
Thanks

A:

You can tell rosdep to ignore packages that are already in the src directory, like so:
rosdep (check|install) --from-paths /path/to/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src

If package B is already in your source workspace, rosdep will not try to download it.
