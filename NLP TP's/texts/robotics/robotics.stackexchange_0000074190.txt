Q:

is hector_slam includes any kind of kalman filter? if not, how should i do?

Hello,
I have -only- LMS100 lidar and can create map with hector_slam. My question is hector_slam includes filters like kalman filter or extended kalman filter (EKF)?
If hector_slam itself doesnt include it, how should i do the filter when creating map with hector_slam??
Thanks, Basak

What do you want to achieve with the KF? Do you want to localize in the map built using hector_slam ?

actually i dont need to localization(but hector_slam does it anyway-with no odometry data) my graduate thesis is just about mapping but my teacher said "use some filter like kalman to get better results and it should be more academic!" :/ so i'm looking for to do in hector_slam which i currently use

I can't help with that, but here's something you might find useful as you're working on your thesis: http://home.isr.uc.pt/~davidbsp/publications/SPR_SSRR2013_SLAM.pdf

A:

There is no Kalman Filter included in the hector_mapping executable, but the output can be fed to a filtering framework. I think robot_localization is the most used and best documented one. There is also hector_localization, but there is no extensive documentation available.

thanks for the answer, i'm gonna check them. Can i ask a little bit unrelated question? (to the one of the creater of hector_slam :)) is the represantation of map from hector_slam is occuancy grid or something else?
Comment by Stefan Kohlbrecher on 2016-05-31:
Yes, it's using a (2D) occupancy gridmap representation.

by the way, does it include or use any kind of filter in hector_slam itself when extracting and building map from laser data, (not in the localization part)?
