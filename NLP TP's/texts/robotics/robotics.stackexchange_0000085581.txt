Q:

tf view_frames syntax error

I have Indigo ROS and Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS. Few month ago when I run rosrun tf view_frames, it worked, but now it gives me a SyntaxError (as seen in the picture). I can't fix the syntax, because I don't have a permission to change files inside ros folder.
Is there any solution to this problem?
ubuntu@ubuntu-MS-7817:~$ rosrun tf view_frames 
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/tf/view_frames", line 57
    print "Listening to /tf for %f seconds"%duration
                                          ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(int "Listening to /tf for %f seconds"%duration)?

I just let your post out of the moderation queue, but if I would apply the support guidelines strictly, I should immediately close it. Was:
Please DO NOT post a screenshot of the terminal or source file.

Not clear enough?

As to your issue: have you installed Anaconda or Python 3 between now and "few months ago"? If so, it could be that python3 is now the default interpreter, and view_frames has not been made Python 3 compatible yet, leading to the syntax error.

@gvdhoorn I'm sorry, I didn't see the guidelines before. Luckily my issue isn't of that sort that would require copying the error to find out what is wrong.

@gvdhoorn I don't remember doing anything with python ever on this computer, but my roommates might. I wouldn't know. Is there a way how to change the default python interpreter version?

I didn't see the guidelines before

they were shown to you almost fullscreen when you created your post.

I'd still like you to replace the image with the copy-pasted text of the error.

@gvdhoorn I have edited the question. Is this done right?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-01:
That's great. Thanks.
As to your problem: what is the output of python --version?
Comment by simff on 2018-03-01:
An alternative way to view tf frames is: rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree. This requires to have this into your workspace :)
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-01:
That would be a possible work-around yes, but it might be better to get to the bottom of this so we can make sure it's not an issue with the packages.

A:

@gvdhoorn it used to output 'python3' I have changed it into 'python2,' but the error remained. I used a command which python to see the path and discovered it leads to python2 inside miniconda3 folder. I have deleted the miniconda3 folder and now it works. Thank you for your patience and help.

Let's make this the answer. I would still it if you could check whether you are up-to-date, as the exact problem you are reporting should have been fixed (on 2017-07-24 already).

@Kri: afaict, ros/geometry#151 should have resolved some lingering python2/3 issues with tf, even on Indigo. Can you make sure you're up-to-date?
Comment by Kri on 2018-03-01:
@gvdhoorn I don't know how to do that. I don't even understand what that means, which makes it hard to search for.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-01:
When was the last time you did an sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade, or used the Ubuntu Software Centre to update your ROS packages (assuming you use Ubuntu)?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-01:
Note that I'm not saying you should upgrade now. I just want to figure out why you're running into this issue which should have already been fixed quite some time ago.
Comment by Kri on 2018-03-01:
That might me problematic. I did that few days ago, but since then the updated ubuntu doesn't get pass login screen (update broke something). Therefor I have to chose older version of ubuntu from GRUB. I don't know what else is not up to date when I run on the older version.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-03-01:
Ok. Let's just chalk this up to using an unsupported Python version for now, and assume it has been fixed in recent versions of tf.
