Q:

Accessing map_server using rosjava

Hi,
I am trying to access the map_server through a client service call to retrieve map information through nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid into my android device using pure implementation Rosjava. However, it seems that there is currently no support for that in Rosjava.
Could anyone help me if you have tried and solved a similar problem?
Thank you very much.

A:

I don't know whether it's still the case, but I remember some discussion about not implementing service calls in rosjava.
In any case, you can get the map by subscribing to the map topic instead of calling a service.
