Q:

Rostest arguments in CMakeLists

I want to hand arguments to a test script which I can do with a regular call:
rostest package_name testlaunchfile.test argument1:=vaule1 argument2:=value2

But what do I do in CMakeLists:
add_rostest(test/testlaunchfile.test argument1:=vaule1 argument2:=value2)

I realize that it wount be working like this because the arguments are interpreted as source files. But what can I do?
Edit: What I tried before:
I was giving the arguments to the launchfile via env vars. which seems to not work either. when i set them manually, it works. but catkin seems to fail setting them correctly. Any Ideas on that?

A:

You can pass arbitrary arguments to rostest using the ARGS KEYWORD, e.g.
add_rostest(test/testlaunchfile.test ARGS argument1:=vaule1 argument2:=value2)

Thank you! This is really helpful. But could I have found this out by miself? I am just asking whether I am missing out on a great ressource or unable to google any more. ;)

This is the third result for rostest arguments: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/232 which I see you've already found.
