Q:

How to plot a message bool in a bag file?

A lot of times there's a bool in a message which qualifies analog data in the message; e.g. nav_data_valid or is_stopped, and which needs to be viewed to understand node behavior. I know I can look at these values in rqt_bag by viewing the raw message, but that doesn't readily show 1-cycle blips in these booleans, or put them in the context of related variables like speed. rqt_bag and bag-tools/plot.py don't allow plotting bools.
I have to imagine this is a common use case - how do people handle it? Thanks for any suggestions.

A:

Found that bag-tools/plot.py does actually plot bools as value 0 or 1 for False or True.
