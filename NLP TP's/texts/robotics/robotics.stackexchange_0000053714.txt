A:

This topic has to be used to set force vector on device, not to get it. Technically there is no force sensors in any of PHANToM devices, so there is no way to obtain such information. Though you can calculate it based on spring-damper model giving displacement as its input.

Send a message to appropriate topic, e.g. to /omni1_force_feedback. To set the force from command line use rostopic pub. See http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics and http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic#rostopic_pub
