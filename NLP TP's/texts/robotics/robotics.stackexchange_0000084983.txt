Q:

Not able viewing image using image_view package

I have been trying to use image_view to to view bottom camera of ardrone simulated in Gazebo but not able to see anything. The below command I've used:
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/ardrone/bottom/image_raw

The gui of camera is just appeared for about 3 seconds before it freezes. I have just upgraded to OpenCV3 anyway. Has it something to do with OpenCV3?
Anything that could go wrong?

A:

I found out that after reinstalling the ROS solves the issue by running the following command along with setting up the appropriate ROS environment variables:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
