Q:

How can I add a plugin to an existing model?

What should be contained inside the  tags of the .world file. ??
Can I use  tags and inside them use  tags?

A:

All sdf tags are described in detail here
To answer your specific question... you can use include tags within a word/sdf file to include model elements, but I don't think it works for plugin elements. The most common usage of include is for models, since people typically include a model file from a world file.
Examples:
some world files
some model files

I guess, I am not clear with my question.
See http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=plugins_model&cat=write_plugin#RunningthePlugin
In the .world file, plugin is applied to the box, but in my case I want the plugin to be applied onto a quadrotor (an existing model), how do I do that?

you just put the plugin tag in the model tag of the quadrotor model.
