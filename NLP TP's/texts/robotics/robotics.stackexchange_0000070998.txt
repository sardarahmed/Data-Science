Q:

Unable to install libgazebo5 in debian Jessie. Please help

Dear all, I am not able to install libgazebo5 package in my Debian Jessie system. I read that this package is required for installing gazebo_ros package(ROS jade has a dependency on this).
The package is shown in my synaptic package manager. However, when I try to install it I get the following error.
"libgazebo5:
Package libgazebo5 has no available version, but exists in the database.
This typically means that the package was mentioned in a dependency and never uploaded, has been obsoleted or is not available with the contents of sources.list"
Can someone please help me with this issue. All I can understand from this error is that the package libgazebo5 is not there in the ubuntu vivid distribution(I am using ros packages build for vivid distribution as mentioned here).
Thank you in advance.

Can you please explain what that means ? I was of the impression that I am using libgazebo package built for ubuntu vivid.

A:

"There is an effort for migrating ROS packages to Debian which probably can help you to bring gazebo binaries to jessie. https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/Robotics/ROS
Check for the http://sir.upc.edu/debian-robotics jessie-robotics mainwhich is managed by Leo Palomo-Avellanade who works in debian-science and uses ROS."
I found answer in another thread in github. I hope this helps others having similar issue.
