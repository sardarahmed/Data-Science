Q:

Displaying my own URDF

I have tried many different methods with no results and now I am asking this kind community.
I have created an URDF file in a package located inside catkin_ws
catkin_ws/src/farmbot_fyp/urdf/farmbot_urdf
and I would like to launch it in rviz, I have tried using the launch files from multiple sources but it did not work, HELP.
I will just want to launch it without depending on the urdf_tutorial display.launch

if you don't tell us what you've already tried - and if it didn't work, what happened instead - we cannot help you.
We're here to help, but always include enough information.

Try putting your display.launch here so we can give it a look.

Also, did you tried adding the robot model in the rviz window? You might be forgetting that.
It looks something like this:

Click the button that says Add and then select Robot Model.
