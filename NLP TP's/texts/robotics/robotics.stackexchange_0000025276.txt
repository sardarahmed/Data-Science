Q:

exception (renderingEngine) 1.0.2 version

dear all,
I installed gazebo from source (debugging-modus), which I downloaded using the mercurial repository. It's the 1.0.2 version and I get some exceptions trying the gzserver command:
Exception [RenderEngine.cc:471] unable to find rendering system
Error [Rendering.cc:37] Failed to load the Rendering engine subsystem
unable to find rendering system
Exception [RenderEngine.cc:471] unable to find rendering system
Exception [Sensors.cc:39] Unable to load the rendering engine
Is this a problem of my system? Should I switch to the 1.0.1 version, if I'd like to create some plugins?
Thank you for your help.
Ferdinand

A:

This problem occurs when Gazebo cannot find the RenderSystem_GL.so that is installed by Ogre.
I would recommend bypassing this issue by upgrading to Gazebo 1.2.3, which has some better logic to find and install the necessary dependencies.
