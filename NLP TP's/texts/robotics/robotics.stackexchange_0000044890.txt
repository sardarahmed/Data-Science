Q:

Bluetooth Serial Errors

Hi,
1.
I am trying to run an Arduino ROS node connected with a bluetooth serial link. I can get it connected, (with rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/rfcomm0)
but it won't stay connected for very long. I get the following error (repeatedly):
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1350185780.476810] bad callback: <bound method Subscriber.callback of <rosserial_python.SerialClient.Subscriber instance at 0xa2b65cc>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/src/rospy/topics.py", line 581, in _invoke_callback
cb(msg)
File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/rosserial/rosserial_python/src/rosserial_python/SerialClient.py", line 121, in callback
self.parent.send(self.id, data_buffer.getvalue())
File "/opt/ros/electric/stacks/rosserial/rosserial_python/src/rosserial_python/SerialClient.py", line 473, in send
self.port.write(data)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/serial/serialposix.py", line 485, in write
raise SerialException('write failed: %s' % (v,))
SerialException: write failed: [Errno 5] Input/output error
Has anyone seen this before and knows what to do about it?
2.
Also, does any one know what this error means? I get it as I run my program, but I can receive messages from my Arduino regardless of if its showing...
[INFO] [WallTime: 1350185758.107044] Packet Failed :  Failed to read msg data

A:

[Errno 5] usually indicates that the port read/write has failed because the port was no longer available, perhaps your Bluetooth link if dropping out?
As for question #2, it means that part of a packet was corrupted/lost causing the whole packet to be dropped (over a noisy wireless link this is somewhat expected).
