A:

Your source.list mixes lucid and maverick entries. You should only have lucid entries in a 10.04 installation. I would replace all maverick entries with the respective lucid entries, run apt-get update and hope that is enough.
In the case this doesn't work something on your system doesn't fit together anymore. What I would suggest is to follow the problem to the root, i.e.

Try to install one of the packages (e.g. ros-electric-vision-opencv) manually/directly
You should see more errors - follow the procedure until you hit a non-ROS package
reinstall this package - you should now have the package installed that fits the rest of your system

You can always check what is going on with your package by using apt-cache policy, e.g.
libopencv2.3-dev:
  Installiert: 2.3.1+svn6514+branch23-9~lucid
  Kandidat: 2.3.1+svn6514+branch23-9~lucid
  Versions-Tabelle:
 *** 2.3.1+svn6514+branch23-9~lucid 0
        500 http://ros.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/packages/ros/ubuntu/ lucid/main Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

This tells you which versions are available, what you have installed and what a candidate for installation would be. The versions should fit.
You especially have a problem if a package is installed in a newer version than available as it probably originated from maverick.

I replace maverick to lucid, and start new terminal to try update & install. But the situation still the same.What to do next? (I have updated the original post)
