Q:

Error when building android_core

Following http://wiki.ros.org/android/Tutorials/kinetic/Installation%20-%20ROS%20Development%20Environment:
When I catkin_make I get the following error msg:

path-to-android-sdk/build-tools/25.0.2/aapt: 3: path-to-android-sdk/build-tools/25.0.2/aapt: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string

:android_10:processReleaseResources FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':android_10:processReleaseResources'.
com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: Failed to execute aapt

Per other threads I've attempted rolling back my build tools version to 23.0.3 however 25.0.2 gets re-added and used.

A:

Update: The issue was, that for some reason I was using a 32bit version of Ubuntu and Android Studio now only supports 64bit systems. Flashing 64bit Ubuntu solved the issue for me.
