Q:

Connect rosccp with graphics

Hello,
I was wondering if I could connect ros C++ with graphics. For example, if I want to draw a map from my lidar data (I know about gmapping, but I want to create something on my own), is there a library or generally a tool that can help me with that?

A:

rviz is the canonical tool for displaying data in ROS; it has built-in plugins for maps, transforms, most types of sensors, and a fair number of other things. It also handles TF and displays the relative position of different data sources with respect to each other in 3D.
ROS doesn't provide any other C++ libraries for displaying graphics or interacting with images; there are already lots of good C++ libraries for doing these things if you want to integrate that functionality directly into your program.
