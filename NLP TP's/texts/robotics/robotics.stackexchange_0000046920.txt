Q:

ROS_WORKSPACE is not supported with catkin workspaces?

Calling roscd with no arguments gives "No ROS_WORKSPACE set" error while using catkin workspaces in Groovy. So it is not supported anymore?
Is there any other way to quickly jump into either top level directory of catkin workspace or its development space?
Thanks,
Boris

UPDATE: Opened a ticket.

+1 for opening the ticket about this

A:

No, currently no such tool exists.
However you can manually set ROS_WORKSPACE currently, to achieve either.
You could also raise a ticket on catkin to start a discussion if you feel others would benefit from such a feature.
