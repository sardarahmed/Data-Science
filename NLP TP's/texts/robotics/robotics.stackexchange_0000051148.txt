Q:

How to calculate the time when robot moved from one position to another or to a some distance?

Hello
I would like to know the travel time for my robot when he move from one position to another. So for example I wont to know the time needed that my robot move 10 m forwards. So I have a map ov the environment and my platform has IMU, laser, Kinect and encoders. So I do not do any navigation just driving the platform for example 20 m forwards and wont to know the time needed to complete that task. Any help?
Thanks

Are you driving yourself by hand? In that case, you'd anyways have inaccuracies in the measurements and you can just use a stopwatch instead of software.

I need a software ROS solution and not a stopwatch. So I need to know the time when platforms move from one position in the map to other.

Im not driving by my self. Im observing when someone else is driving it.

You can read out the encoders to measure the travelled distance and run a timer in parallel?
Comment by Astronaut on 2013-05-15:
the encoders are drifted. So maybe better to use the pose, How to run  a ROS timer??

A:

You can just use the system clock, and subtract the start time from the end time.  In python
import time

start = time.clock()
# Do something
end = time.clock()

print end-start, 'seconds'

and in C++, use gettimeofday() or some similar function.
