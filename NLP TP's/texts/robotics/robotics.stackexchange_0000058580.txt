Q:

Can I make a directory in launch file?

My local machine is a laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 (old, I know).  While collecting data during my experiments, I am generating text files for Matlab, but I want to organize a single experiment into a new directory. Here is my test code (found on an ANT reference page):
<!-- -*- mode: XML -*-  -->
<launch>
  <mkdir dir="/home/turtlebot/00x/"/>
  <!-- Other Stuff excluded as irrelevant -->
</launch>

Does anyone know a way to have a directory (in this case /00x/) automatically generated using XML?

Also, nodes can be shell scripts, making directory creation pretty straightforward.
