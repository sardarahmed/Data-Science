A:

Press Alt+F2 and write this command there with Ubuntu (or you can do with terminal instead of Alt+F2):
nautilus ~/.ros

This command opens your file manager with the path: /home/$USER/.ros
In linux, file/folder names that start with a dot . means that they're hidden. You can toggle viewing/hiding hidden files in your file manager nautilus by Ctrl+H.
