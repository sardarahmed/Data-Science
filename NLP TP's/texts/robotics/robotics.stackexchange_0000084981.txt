Q:

Error The manifest must contain exactly one "description" tags

I recently try to build a package for standalone ROS node in MATLAB Simulink. I've followed the instructions perfectly until build catkin workspace step.

I failed sereval times finding work around for this problem, but still...!
I use ROS Kinetic in Ubuntu 16.04. Many thanks !

A:

Your package.xml is probably missing or has an extra <description> tag. Either add the missing or delete the extra tag(s).

that isn't the case. This workspace "USV_ws2" is duplicated from USV_ws and the original USV_ws is built successfully.
When I duplicated USV_ws to USV_ws2 I also deleted 2 folders build and devel. And then catkin_make again. Then this error happens.
