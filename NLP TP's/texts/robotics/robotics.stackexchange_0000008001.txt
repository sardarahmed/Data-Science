Q:

Add hardware reset button for Create2

Is there any way to add a reset button to the Create2 that would be the equivalent  of temporarily disconnecting the battery? 

A:

There is no good way to do this by hacking in a switch because the battery goes right into the main PCB, but you do have two other good options.

Send opcode 7: "This command resets the robot, as if you had removed and reinserted the battery"
Press and hold the SPOT and DOCK buttons for 10 seconds.
