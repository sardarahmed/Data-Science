Q:

rviz segmentation fault on launch in electric

Hi,
I am running electric with 10.04, I get the following:
xxxxx@ubuntu:~$ rosrun rviz rviz
rviz revision number 1.6.4ng with size 1 x 1
ogre_tools revision number 1.6.2
compiled against OGRE version 1.7.3 (Cthugha)
Loading general config from [/home/xxxxx/.rviz/config]
Loading display config from [/home/xxxxx/.rviz/display_config]
RTT Preferred Mode is PBuffer.
Texture for pass 0: creating with size 1 x 1
Segmentation fault
I have done some searching here on answers without anything working for me. The suggestion is that you should just remove .rviz/display_config, however one doesn't exist in the first place. So guys and gals, what should I do? I would rather not install diamondback. There was suggestions that that still works. This should work under electric.
Appreciate any help.
