Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: gtest-config

Hi,
I upgraded from diamondback to electric. Compiling my sources with rosmake I get
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/roslisp/cmake/roslisp.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/rospy/cmake/rospy.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/electric/stacks/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp/cmake/roscpp.cmake
CMake Error at /opt/ros/electric/ros/core/rosbuild/public.cmake:448 (message):
Failed to invoke gtest-config
Am I missing a (kubuntu) package?
libgtest-dev is already installed on my machine. Unfortunately, it does not contain the gtest-config script.
Any ideas?
Tobias

A:

When upgrading from one ROS distribution to the next, it is generally a good idea to completely rebuild any working tree previously compiled using the previous version.
$ rosmake <your_packages> --pre-clean
