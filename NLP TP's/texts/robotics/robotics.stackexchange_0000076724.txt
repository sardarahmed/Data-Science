Q:

[MoveIt!] How to set a start pose with python?

Hi guys,
is it possible to set the pose (e.g. described as a list of joint angles) of the robot to certain values without planning a path, using the python move_group interface?
Possibly there doesn't exist a path from my current pose A to the desired start pose B, but I want to find a path from B to C.
I think the 'set_start_state' function is supposed to provide this; however, I don't know how the start point is supposed to be specified (as msg).

A:

It appears to be a RobotState message from here. You can print out the start_state to see what it consists of.

Using the robot_state doesn't work for me.
I used these functions:
state = robot.get_current_state()
group.set_start_state(state)

If the state is set like that, and then a path is planned somewhere else, the path will start in the state it was before setting it to something else.
