Q:

Is ROS able to support C# language?

Hi,
I want to use c# to build robot interface.
I found c# is very convenient,because both windows and linux can run the same c# program.
c# can use mono to run.
So if c# can also be included in ROS, it will be very great~

A:

C# is not supported yet; if you must use C#, your only option would be to re-implement the basic network protocols in C#, but that will be a lot of work.
If you are just looking for a way to build a platform-independent robot interface, you could have a look at rosjava.

Is anyone who want to implement c# interface? Because I found that many useful libraries like aforge which has a lot of high level of tech like machine learning,neural network,fuzzy,genetic algorithms...etc.

It's not really necessary to re-implement it. You could also use a foreign language interface and wrap it around roscpp as the old jni based rosjava did it. Of course, that wouldn't run on windows then :)
