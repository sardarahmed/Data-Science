Q:

If publishes faster than calling SpinOnce, would CallBack Queue be filled up eventually?

If we have a publisher publishing at 40Hz, and the subscriber is calling SpinOnce at 20Hz, would our CallBack Queue be filled up eventually?

A:

Depends on how long your callbacks run. But spinOnce does not just execute only one callback but it will empty the queue if possible and then return.
