Q:

Don't see interactive markers in MoveIt demo.launch

Hi,
I have done the moveit configuration procedure for my robot, however when I launch the demo.launch I don't see the interactive markers in RViz. I have defined four planning groups and kinematic solvers for these groups (KDL) in the kinematics.yaml file. I do get a warning when launching the demo, that no parent groups have been defined for my end effectors. What could be the problem?

A:

Just solved my problem: I didn't have the parent link for the end-effector properly configured in my srdf file.
Thanks anyway!

Could you elaborate about what change made your configuration proper? I have the same problem and haven't found the trick yet.
