Q:

How to find the number of times a package has been installed for apt

Hi
I'm trying to generate metrics for packages I maintain to see how many times they've been installed from ros buildfarm deployment system through apt-get/other package managers. Is there a way to find this info from repositories.ros.org or any other links? Anyone I can contact to get these metrics?

A:

It's a bit indirect and your package(s) may not be listed, but from ROS Metrics Report extension on ROS Discourse you can get to awstats.osuosl.org/list/packages.ros.org which is the Awstats page for packages.ros.org.
From there to this page for December, 2018 and then finally to the full list for the Downloads (Top 10) section.
ctrl+f on your package name should give you some statistics.

Thanks for the answer, that's a really solid find thanks! However, my packages (and most packages) don't appear in that list, they look like mostly the core packages or things with very high install rates.

Well, as I wrote:

your package(s) may not be listed

It's all parsed data, so things below certain thresholds will not be shown.
Afaik this is as much detail as you're going to get, so if this doesn't cover it then I'm afraid the answer -- in your specific case -- is going to be ..

.. that you can't get those statistics (for now at least).
