Q:

is there a way to zoom or maximize the images in rviz?

In rviz when you add an Image, a pane to the left appears and it shows the images a topic is publishing.
For example in the bottom left you can see the pane

Is there a way to:

Maximize the image pane?
Zoom the image
Have some interactivity with the pane?

A:

Maximize the image pane?

not in the traditional sense of maximising. You can make it a floating window and then change the size, but it won't be docked in the main RViz windows any more.

Zoom the image

No.

Have some interactivity with the pane?

No.
Not with the default version of that display.
Perhaps there are some community contributed versions or alternatives, but I wouldn't know of any.
