Q:

Is this supposed to be a bearing?

I'm looking at the assembly of a tail rotor that should look like this

I wonder if the "tail output shaft stopper" (circled in red) is meant to be a bearing or just a piece of metal stopper:

My reading is that, since it's held by 2 set screws, the whole part should rotate with the rod. While rotating, it'd rub against the bevel gear on the tail drive though. Am I missing something?

A:

A shaft stopper like that is made to let you assemble the device more precisely.  The bearings look like they are in the "Tail Gear Case Plate" subassemblies.  By using a shaft stopper you can insert the shaft into the bearings, but keep the shaft stopper set screws loose.  Then add whatever preload you want and locktite it in place (notice the "red" instructions in the drawing).
Regarding your additional question about how to secure the bearing: attaching a shaft and bearing can be a challenge.  Often a press is used if they are smaller components.  For large items the bearing is often heated, and, less commonly in my experience, the shaft may be cooled in dry ice.  A press may still be needed.  The tight clearance between the inner race of the bearing and the shaft helps to ensure the load is spread along the ID of the bearing.
