Q:

Limiting Velodyne point cloud

The view_direction and view_width parameters updated for HDL32 doesn't seem to work. Has anyone tried it?

Are you installing the binary driver packages, or building it yourself from source?

A:

It works for me.
Run the driver in one terminal (with a PCAP or using the raw device):
roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud 32e_points.launch pcap:=~/Downloads/velodyne/32e.pcap

Run rviz in another.
In a third terminal run rqt.

select Plugins>>Configuration>>Dynamic Reconfigure
click on the cloud_nodelet
set view_width to something less than 2*PI
set view_direction to the desired angle (0 is straight ahead)
