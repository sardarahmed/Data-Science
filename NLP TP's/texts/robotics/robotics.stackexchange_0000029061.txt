Q:

What is the Ignition Gazebo equivalent of WorldPose()?

How could I get the world pose of a Model in Ignition? The closest I can find is
std::optional<math::Pose3d> WorldPose ( const EntityComponentManager &  _ecm) const

but this function only seems to be for links.

A:

There's ignition::gazebo::worldPose from Util.hh, which will work for any entity that has a components::Pose. All models will have that component.
