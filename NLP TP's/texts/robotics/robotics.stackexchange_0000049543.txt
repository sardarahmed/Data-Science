Q:

serial numbers in a launch file

I am new to ros and I am trying to create a launch file to start two motor controllers, roscore, and some other nodes. I have two motor controllers that are identical except for their serial number. When using the terminal I would type (each in its own terminal),

rosrun pololu_smc_driver smc_driver_node __name:=r_controller _smc_serial:="3800-6F06-3055-3932-7560-0343"

rosrun pololu_smc_driver smc_driver_node __name:=l_controller _smc_serial:="3800-6B06-3055-3932-4160-0343"

Doing that would make two nodes, one named  "r_controller" using the device with the serial number of" 3800-6F06-3055-3932-7560-0343"
and the other node being "l_controller" with its serial number. How do I do that same thing in the launch file? What would that translate to?

A:

In general, take a look at the XML spec for roslaunch files: http://ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML
For your specific case, you'll want  tags that specify a name, and parameter tags for the serial numbers. Something like:
<launch>
    <node pkg="pololu_smc_driver" type="smc_driver_node" name="r_controller">
        <param name="smc_serial" value="3800-6F06-3055-3932-7560-0343"/>
    </node>
</launch>

Along with a similar  tag for your left motor controller.

I tried   " 

</launch
but when I tried to run it, it returns "Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: mismatched tag: line 5, column 3""

You're closing your  tag prematurely; don't do that.  In particular, /> at the end of the tag specifies a self-closing tag, which is not what you want.

<node name="r_controller" pkg="pololu_smc_driver"  type="smc_driver_node"
    

Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 4, column 2

as you can tell, I have no clue what I am dong.
I looked at "http://ros.org/wiki/roslaunch/XML" but it did not help much. I am trying to start two nodes, one that uses a specific device with a serial number of"XX-XX"

Updated my example. I suggest you go read an XML tutorial to get a better grasp of how XML tags and nesting work: http://zvon.org/comp/r/tut-XML.html
