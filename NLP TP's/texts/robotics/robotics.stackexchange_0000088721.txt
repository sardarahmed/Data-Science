Q:

How to edit package source code?

I get the source code files for move base with apt-get source, but how do i put them in move_base directory so i can edit them there and it gets saved and compiled??

A:

There are a variety of old answers that walk through this process: #q252478 is one.  You'll want to git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git (package wiki pages usually link to the source repo pages) to put the source into a catkin_ws instead of using apt-get.  If you source devel/setup.sh after building you'll be using the customized version of move_base instead of the one perhaps already installed with apt.

@lucasw: @topkek has used apt-get source. That got him the sources of move_base as they were used to build the currently released version of move_base.
See #q301627 for some more context.

Maybe this works https://askubuntu.com/questions/28372/how-do-i-get-and-modify-the-source-code-of-packages-installed-through-apt-get ?  Even if it does I think a regular catkin_ws + git clone is more likely to be what they want, and is on the path to pushing changes back to github and pull requests.
