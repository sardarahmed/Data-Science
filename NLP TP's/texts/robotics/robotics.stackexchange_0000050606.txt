Q:

Modify stage appearance

Is there a way of modifying the appearance of the "floor" of the field in certain regions without adding obstacles?  I'm making a simulation where bee-like robots congregate under areas of high temperature, and I want to show these regions of high temperature by coloring the floor of the field in those regions differently than the rest (so there will be big red circles in some spots and the rest will be the normal checkerboard pattern).  Is this an option, or do I have to configure my own visualization window or something?

do you want to visualize the temperature regions on stage or rviz? or it does not matter?

A:

Currently stageros support certains capabilities of stage simulator,(like just laser ranger sensor and just allow one laser per robot), if you want to add extra features, like a background, (I want this too), you have to make a custom simulator based on stage (maybe modifying stageros?).
