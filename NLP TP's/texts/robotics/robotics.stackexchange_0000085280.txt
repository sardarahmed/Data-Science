Q:

Simulate and control multiple AR drones in tum_simulator+Gazebo+ROS

Hi,
Update: I have also installed hector packages mentioned in this post. It was need to control a single drone.
I am currently trying to simulate (and potentially wish to control) two Parrot A.R. drones in tum_simulator + Gazebo 7 + ROS Kinetic setup.

I am having the exact same issue as asked here. The first drone keeps rising when the command to takeoff is published.

I have also used code from this but it doesnt improve anything for me.

I also came across this github pull request for tum_simulator for ROS indigo. However, it doesn't seem to have been merged in with the master branch which leads me to think whether it is correct modification or not? (Also, I'm currently using kinetic while the pull request is for indigo. I don't mind reinstalling indigo, but I don't know if that code is correct or not).

Anyone who has faced this issue before and managed to find a solution,
Could you kindly help me out ?
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Hi, I have already done that earlier. It was required to control a single drone.
