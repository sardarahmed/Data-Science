Q:

How to configure ekf_localization_node in robot_localization package

How to use ekf node in robot_localization package, I have odom and Imu data check discussion.
Is it possible to calculate robot_Pose with out using tf and urdf ?
should I start all node together in launch file??
correct me If i am wrong.

How to compare  this position with ground truth.

@Tom Moore and @Anas alhashimi plz look into this

A:

It depends on the frames in which your data is reported. If your odometry or IMU data is in a frame other than your world_frame or base_link_frame, then you will need to provide a transform using tf so that robot_localization knows how to transform the data. I would advise that you start robot_localization in its own launch file. How you organize your launch files for everything else is entirely up to you. robot_localization doesn't need any URDF models, unless you are using those models to provide the tf transforms for your sensors.

It is working Now, Is there any way to draw a graph or plot for robot_localization's output. (Odometry/filtering)? Some default Covariance matrix is given, on which basis I should update that one.

Have you tried rviz?
Comment by KDROS on 2015-01-21:
Nope, How to use that one? with robot_localization.
Comment by KDROS on 2015-01-22:
Thanx @tom moore I can see in rviz. Understood my mistake.

@Tom Moore
But Can you tell me, How should I decide values for Covariance matrix.
I dropped one mail to you. Waiting for reply.

Yes, I'm afraid I've been a bit busy the past couple weeks. I'll look into it as soon as possible.
