Q:

How to kill master process 'rosout'? (will always respawn)

I used 'roscore &' to launch the ROS master server in a shell script. That might not have been a good idea. After invoking this script I failed to kill process rosout as it always respawns with a different pid. It looks like a watchdog process but I couldn't find one so far. Is there any possibility to kill rosout without having to restart my system?

A:

It's a python script.
So killall python will work.
If you have other python stuff running:
ps aux|grep roscore and kill the python process with roscore in the name

Yes, you're totally right that my suggestion to use 'killall python' is nasty (I pointed this out, too). I removed my answer to avoid any further confusion and let quality rule over quantity.

I strongly recommend against running "killall python".  That will kill every python process on your system.

killall python no longer works. Is there an elegant solution to this problem?
