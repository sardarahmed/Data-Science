Q:

Unable to find executable

Hello Everyone,
I am completely new to ROS and programming in C++, I am looking for a program to move the turtlebot forward and found a tutorial named sending simple goals to navigation stack. However, I tried the tutorial (http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/SendingSimpleGoals) to move the robot forward by 1 meter. I have followed the tutorial in the exact way but unable to execute the program and it shows an error message:
asun@asun-Latitude-E6400:~$ rosrun simple_navigation_goals simple_navigation_goals

[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named simple_navigation_goals below /home/asun/catkin_ws/src/simple_navigation_goals
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   /home/asun/catkin_ws/src/simple_navigation_goals
[rosrun]   /home/asun/catkin_ws/src/simple_navigation_goals/include/simple_navigation_goals

I can see the executable file under this folder:
home/asun/catkin_ws/src/simple_navigation_goals/include/simple_navigation_goals

Please help me with the solution. I am using ROS-Hydro and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS precise.
Also, I am completely new to this. Please help me with any tutorial in C++ or python to move the robot forward or backward in the simulator as well as the turtlebot itself using code but not teleop.
Any help will be much appreciated.
I have built the code using catkin_make and it produced the following result:
asun@asun-Latitude-E6400:~$ cd ~/catkin_ws/

Then i have executed the program using command
rosrun simple_navigation_goals simple_navigation_goals
but this time it shows a new error which doesnt make sense, as i have created a package myself as per the tutorial.
asun@asun-Latitude-E6400:~/catkin_ws$ rosrun simple_navigation_goals simple_navigation_goals
[rospack] Error: stack/package simple_navigation_goals not found

What's your CMakeList.txt look like? Can you confirm where simple_navigation_goals.cpp is located?
You also asked for more tutorials, you can check out our ROS tutorials The ROS101: Creating a workspace, package and publisher tutorial seems to suit your needs

I am facing the same issue, have you found the solution to this?

A:

I think you missed sourcing your workspace after catkin_make:
source /home/asun/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

If you have only sourced the setup.bash of the ros distro in /opt/ros/...  your environment will not know where the packages/execs in your workspace are places....

I have sourced it as per your comments. Now it returns to the previous error and displays that the executable is not found.
