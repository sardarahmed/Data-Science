Q:

What happened if I install two version of ROS?

Because I found that the latest version of ROS is coming(electric).
If I want to try that version,but also use the origin version of ROS.
Is they will conflict?
Or should I just upgrade to the latest version?
I have tried 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'.
Is this instruction will check any version of ROS could be update? And if not,it just upgrade all the other packages?
Thank you~

A:

Your ROS installations won't interfere with each other, if using the precompiled .deb packages or installing from source into different directories. E.g. diamondback will install into /opt/ros/diamondback, whereas electric will install into /opt/ros/e-turtle (or "electric", whatever the actual directory will be). Once you source one "setup.bash" you will run (and compile) in that ROS version only.
So, apt-get dist-upgrade will not upgrade your ROS installation into a new distribution as the package prefixes are different.

Yes. Your code might not be compatible to both, though.

If I want to change versions,I just run the correct setup.bash file without other steps,right?
