Q:

xv_11 laser_driver tutorial

Hello,
I am trying to run the xv_11 laser_driver tutorials.  I am trying to run it in Hydro.  I have FTDI cable setup to communicate with the lidar unit.  I have verified that it is putting out information running putty with Windows.  Every time I try to run:
rosrun xv_11_laser_driver neato_laser_publisher _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0.  I get [ERROR] [1409421260.809415062]: Error instantiating laser object.Are you sure you have the correct port and baud rate? Error was Permission denied.
Here is a list of my lsusb:
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 005 Device 003: ID 413c:2107 Dell Computer Corp. 
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 004 Device 002: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 045e:0745 Microsoft Corp. Nano Transceiver v1.0 for Bluetooth
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub

It does show the FTDI adapter.
Any help with what I am doing wrong would be very appreciated.
Thank you

A:

This is most likely a simple permission problem (as the error states). See if this answer (to Rosrun as super user) helps.
