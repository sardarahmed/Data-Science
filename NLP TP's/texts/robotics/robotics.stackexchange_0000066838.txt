I am having the same problem.
Indigo, Ubuntu 14.04, Firefox 44.0.2
Tutorial simple.html can be found at https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs/blob/develop/examples/simple.html
The Firefox webconsole reports;
ReferenceError: ROSLIB is not defined (simple.html line)

A:

Did you download the roslibjs repository from source? The example file attempts to load the JS file locally from the source build. If you are trying to copy-and-paste the example and run it without the source code, you can change line 6 of the example to include the following:
<script src="http://cdn.robotwebtools.org/roslibjs/current/roslib.min.js"></script>
