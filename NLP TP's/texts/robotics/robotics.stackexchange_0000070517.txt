Q:

Error compiling visp_vision

Getting the following error when making visp. Any idea on how to resolve this? visp_bridge was installed via ubuntu  software center and rosdep install visp_bridge was also run in terninal.

Why do you install it by source? If you have Indigo or Jade, you could just install it from the repositories:
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-visp
