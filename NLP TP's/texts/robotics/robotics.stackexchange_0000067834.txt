Q:

Docker prerelease setting and ROS Indigo incompatible?

New way of prerelease introduced upon Jade release requires some python3 packages, such as following to my knowledge, which uninstalls so many packages on my Trusty machine so that ROS Indigo (and perhaps Jade too) becomes unusable. How can I use this method while I keep using Indigo?
python3-ros-buildfarm, python3-catkin-pkg, python3-rosdistro, python3-ros-buildfarm, python3-rospkg

A:

I ran into this as well. Instead of python3-ros-buildfarm, just install python-ros-buildfarm.
