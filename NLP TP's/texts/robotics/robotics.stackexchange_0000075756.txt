Q:

rosbridge can't be installed in ubuntu 16.04

I can't install rosbridge for some reasons.
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosbridge-server
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-rosbridge-server
The system is update and all the other packages are working fine. I'm using kinetic.
Thanks.

A:

Lots of users have requested a released version for Kinetic: https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/issues/214 , but the developers are still working on it.
