Q:

Creating an Autoware Vector Map from CARLA Point Cloud Map

Hello,
I am running Autoware (1.12.0) with Carla (0.9.5) using a ROS bridge.
The bridge works fine, but the agent does not avoid obstacles. LiDAR Euclidean clustering detects objects and passes them on to the costmap generator. The costmap generator however does not have any output. I suspect that the problem is the missing vector map.
Therefore I tried to create a verctor map based on the point cloud map, using Autowares Vector Map Builder (https://tools.tier4.jp/feature/vector_map_builder/). But when I try to upload the Carla PCD file nothing happens. Apparently the Vector Map Builder can not import binary compressed PCD files.
This error appears in the console of the Vector Map Builder
THREE.PCDLoader: binary_compressed files are not supported

Is there a way to import binary compressed files, or a way to uncompress the file?
Thanks for yours support!

Hi udeto,
Just wanted get your feedback.
I'm trying something similar with Carla.
Were you able to create vector map for any Carla Towns?
What was your experience?
Did the agent avoid obstacles after using vector map?
Thanks

Hi have you managed to do this as i'm in the same boat now trying to generate a vector map from carla town pcd using the vector map builder yet it doesn't import it ...

A:

Hi!
Vector map tool can only read ascii.
So, you should convert by using pcl_tools.
It is a command line tools for pcl.
