Q:

RVIZ unable to load libdefault_plugin.so

Hi,
After I tried running motion planning example for PR2 robot , there is a problem with my RVIZ that it is unable to load libdefault_plugin.so and thus when I click add , an empty panel appears and I am unable to add any display type .e.g camera.
Exact error at the terminal when I launch RVIZis as follows ;
"

[ERROR] [1349764334.800506677]:
wxWidgets Error
[/opt/ros/electric/stacks/robot_model/colladadom/lib/libcollada15dom.so:
undefined symbol:
_ZN7pcrecpp2RE4InitEPKcPKNS_10RE_OptionsE]
[ERROR] [1349764334.800632354]:
Unable to load library
[/opt/ros/electric/stacks/visualization/rviz/lib/libdefault_plugin.so]

"
I shall be thankful if any one could guide me to get out of this.

A:

Check if you have compiled version of colladadom.
roscd colladadom
ls lib/

if the lib/ directory is empty try to recompile the package
rosmake colladadom
