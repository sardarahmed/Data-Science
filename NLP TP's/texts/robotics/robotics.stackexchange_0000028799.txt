Q:

How does Gazebo publish ROS messages?

HI does someone mind please explaining how exactly Gazebo is able to publish ROS topics on a high level?
My understanding is that Gazebo uses Google Protobuff and boost::ASIO to publish/subscribe topics between its own libraries (e.g. physics, rendering); however, how are these messages "converted" to ROS messages? My guess is that there is a Gazebo plugin to access one of the Gazebo libraries and in that plugin there is code to convert a Gazebo message to ROS message, initialise a ROS publisher, and then publish the ROS message, but can someone please confirm?
Thank you for your help in advance!

Yup, you pretty much nailed it. There isn't an automatic "conversion", hence why you can't publish custom gazebo message types as ros messages without writing a bunch of code to do that conversion (or vice-versa). You can find some further explanations here:

and the source code for those plugins here:
