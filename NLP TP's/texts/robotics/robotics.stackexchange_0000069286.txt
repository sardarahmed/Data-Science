Q:

Should global costmap have an obstacle layer when using a SLAM node?

I am trying to build a navigation system, but am a bit confused about the configuration of my global costmap for move_base.
I am using gmapping to create a map of the environment, which is published to /map.
I want global_costmap to use this map while planning, so I set static_map to true.
I find that global_costmap will load an obstacle layer and inflation layer by default.
Should I keep the obstacle layer? Wouldn't it just be redundant with the gmapping?

A:

I agree that it would most likely be redundant in the global_costmap, so you should not keep it.

Thank you very much.

Wouldn't it make sense to keep the obstacle layer, given it uses a VoxelLayer (2.5d obstacle info) while the SLAM node (gmapping) might not?

If the obstacle layer is a voxel layer, then possibly it might not be redundant.
