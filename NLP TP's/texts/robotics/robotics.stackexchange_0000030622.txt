Q:

Purpose of pose estimations in tod_detecting?

What is the purpose of the pose estimations in tod_detecting when recognizing textured objects using "rosrun tod_detecting recognizer --mode=0 ..."? Are they relevant for the recognition process (not running kinect mode)?

(picture showing the estimated pose of a training object, as described by rvec and tvec)
Why do we need to make pose estimations in the tod_training pipeline, apart from using the pose estimation to segment the point cloud to generate a ROI mask? I mean the training pipeline does not really collect any real 3d features.

A:

I don't understand first part of your question.
We do pose estimation in training for calculation transformation between frames.
mode = xx
Now tod_detecting contains two recognizers. First version of TOD (textured_object_detection package) was implemented for recognizing objects on 5 MP prosilica dataset. Later Ethan and me began to refactor this code. In result we get two versions of detection algorithms: Kinect mode and TOD mode. Kinect mode gives better results on Kinect data, TOD mode gives better results on 5MP data.

Thanks! I just wondered where the pose estimates are used in detecting objects. In other words,  is the pose estimation required in tod_detecting and if so, why? See http://answers.ros.org/question/537/are-my-findings-about-tod_detecting-correct
