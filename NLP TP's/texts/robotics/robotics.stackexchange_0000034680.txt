A:

Hi,
have you installed all system dependencies? (execute the apt-get command generated by 'rosdep satisfy knowrob'). It sounds like Java is not correctly installed on your system. After this, try a 'rosmake --pre-clean knowrob'
If that does not help, some information about your setup would help (Java JDK type and version, OS version, which command produces this error etc).
thanks,
Moritz
