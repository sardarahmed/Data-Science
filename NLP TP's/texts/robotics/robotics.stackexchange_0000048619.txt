Q:

InteractiveMarker with multiple interaction modes?

This seems like something that ought to be possible, but I'm not seeing how to do it. I am making interactive markers for display in rviz, and I would like to have both the BUTTON and MENU interaction modes for each marker. As far as I can tell, though, it is only possible to assign one interaction mode to one marker. Surely there must be a way to assign multiple modes to a single marker? Does anyone have any suggestions? I am on Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS Groovy.

A:

Button controls can have a right-click menu assigned to them, like all other types of controls except for NONE.

Thanks for the reply. Can you point me to some documentation for how to do that?

There is a menu example in http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/Tutorials/Interactive%20Markers%3A%20Getting%20Started

Ah, thank you, that makes more sense. I had been looking at this page: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz/Tutorials/Interactive%20Markers%3A%20Basic%20Controls
