Q:

Is it possible to create a catkin package to provide precompiled libraries?

Is there a way to create a catkin package that only provides precompiled libraries instead of building them, so that other catkin packages can depend on them and the libraries are present in the devel folder when the other packages are build?
Greetings, Thiemo

Why pre-compiled libraries? For what architecture? Do you not have the sources?

A:

The question is better framed "is there a way to do this with CMake". catkin doesn't make any restrictions on this, but it also does not provide specific infrastructure to support it.
Distributing precompiled binaries is bad because it basically limits the package's availability to select platforms and architectures. That being said maybe you can look at the prosilica_gige_sdk:
https://github.com/ros-drivers/prosilica_gige_sdk
This package distributes binaries for several architectures.
You'll also want to review the legal consequences for distributing binaries which you got from somewhere else with do not provide the source code. If they do provide source code I highly advise you to use that instead.
