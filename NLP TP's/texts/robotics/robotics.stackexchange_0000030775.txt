Q:

Laser beam visualization in Stage

Hi,
I tried out the Erratic simulation using Stage and it works fine. But for some reason the visualization of the laser beams (as shown in the sample Stage output on SimulatingOneRobot ) don't show up. That seems to be a nice feature to have for a simulation. Has the feature been removed in CTurtle or do I need to make some changes to the .world file to see this.
Thanks,
Sagnik

A:

Press the "D" key in the Stage window or select to show Data from the menu.
