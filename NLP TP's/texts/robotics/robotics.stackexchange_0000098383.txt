Q:

ROS2 Python launch files

Greetings. Since ROS2 allows for launch files written in Python I would like to ask if there is a usable/proper documentation available for such files (possible commands, their definition and so on)?
I am hard pressed to find even the syntax for more advanced use cases as the generic ones of the tutorials. Almost all examples are written in XML, however I imagine the things written in XML are also possible in Python.
Such as the usage of a launch file inside of another launch file, the search for ROS2 packages in the workspace, etc.
Unfortunately, the documentation on github is not really extensive enough to use the Python launch system properly. Is there maybe a comparison between the XML commands and the Python commands?

A:

I agree, this was confusing for me when I made the transition previously.
I think the ros2_cookbook might help you in:

including other launch files
getting the share directory of the workspace
