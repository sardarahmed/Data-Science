Q:

gazebo crashes on startup

Running the command
gazebo

opens two blank windows, then closes them, then opens a window with a nice toolbar and stuff that looks like it's doing what it's supposed to do. A fraction of a second later, the program closes. It doesn't seem to have any sort of error message. It just has

I also tried running gzserver and gzclient on separate terminals. gzserver seems to work fine.

However, gzclient does not.
gzclient: error while loading shared libraries: liburdfdom_model.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Edit:
Sourcing did nothing.
gazebo /usr/empty_world.sdf got me

Attempting to install ROS with the instructions here failed on step 1.5:
sudo rosdep init

which gave me:
sudo: rosdep: command not found

I think this can fix your problem. Source: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.5/ros_enabled_model_plugin
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/local/lib/gazebo_plugins:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/gazebo_ros_plugin/models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
gazebo ~/gazebo_ros_plugin/<your_world_file>.world

A:

How did you install gazebo?

Can you run just gzserver?

If you can run gzserver, try running gzstats in another terminal while gzserver is running.

gazebo /usr/empty_world.sdf is a bad command, as the resulting error messages indicate. The file /usr/empty_world.sdf does not exist.

Can you provide a backtrace?
