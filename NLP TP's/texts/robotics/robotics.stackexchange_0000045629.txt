Q:

How to install moveit on fuerte?

As the title suggest I'm trying to install moveit for motion planning purposes on ROS Fuerte. In this page it's written that it is available for fuerte only from source. However in the instructions page, there is nothing about fuerte. How should I do that?

If you figure it out I'd be really happy to know how you did it. I'm also trying to get moveit to work but I'm trying to use Groovy beta packages and not having a lot of success either.

There are two packages that I should test: ros-fuerte-moveit-core and ros-fuerte-moveit-msgs. I don't know if they do the job or not. Have you tried with these two?

A:

Did you try replacing all groovy packages with the corresponding fuerte versions? You might run into build problems but there is a certain chance that it works.

I tried but there are several packages that have no corresponding in fuerte. Don't think it will really work.
