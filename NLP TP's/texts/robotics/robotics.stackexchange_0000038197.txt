Q:

turtlebot + gazebo + simulated kinect

Hello,
I'm having problem with reading simulated Kinect raw or rgb image. I'm running electric with turtlebot_gazebo on Ubuntu 10.04. I don't get any of the data to build point cloud in rviz. It is like that Kinect is not publishing to any of the topics even though I see /cloud_throttled [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2] topic.
The only thing I can read (I assume from kinect?) and visualize in rviz is topic /scan [sensor_msgs/LaserScan].
Oh, and one quick question. Should turtlebots dashboard work in simulatated environment? Because if I call rosrun turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard the dashboard does come up, but only the middle icon under diagnostic is green.
Thank you for your help!

Nobody had this problems? Any tips?

the dashboard is only meant to work with the physical robot

A:

This is a bug in the gazebo.urdf.xacro file. The camera frame names were not correct and therefore the gazebo plugins couldn't initialize properly. It's fixed in 330:4253a4e5f257 . It's released in turtlebot 0.9.2
