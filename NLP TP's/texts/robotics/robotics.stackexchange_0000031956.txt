Q:

Relative Rotation Between two Quaternions

I want to find a relative rotation between two quaternions quatA and quatB, i.e. quatC is a quaternion rotation that if applied to quatA would result in quatB. Is there a command/library in ROS which does this? Will tf be of any help?

A:

There is a Python version of the KDL library (PyKDL), which allows you to do all sorts of conversions between rotation representations. An example would look like this:
import PyKDL
a = PyKDL.Rotation.Quaternion(x, y, z, w)
b = PyKDL.Rotation.Quaternion(x, y, z, w)

c = a * b.Inverse()
c.GetQuaternion()  # get quaternion result
c.GetRPY()  # get roll pitch yaw result
c.GetEulerZYX()   # get euler angle result in zyx format

There is a small tutorial here that will give you some more background.
