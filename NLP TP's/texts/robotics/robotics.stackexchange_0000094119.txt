Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ros2 turtlesim

Hi guys,
I am using ros2 dashing and work with turtlesim (1.0.1). Unfortunatly, I realized that a number of features described in the tutorial do not work for me.

Action Servers explained in Understanding ROS Actions are not available. According to the tutorial I expected to see something like Action Servers: /turtle1/rotate_absolute: turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute. But when I run

ros2 node info /turtlesim

no actions are visible.
    /turtlesim
    Subscribers:
        ...
    Publishers:
        ...
     Services:
        ...

The Parameter setting is described in Understanding ROS2 Parameters. When I run
> ros2 param set /turtlesim background_r 150

I receive
    Set parameter successful

but nothing happens, the background remains in the same color as before. I assume that I am doing something wrong. Does someone have advice for me?
Best wishes!
Sebastian

A:

The overview page for the beginner tutorials states:

Currently, the beginner level tutorials target Eloquent. Certain features may not be available for older distributions.

The ros2 node info command listing actions is one of those. It is only available as of Eloquent.
Regarding the immediate update of the background color when setting the parameter: that feature is available in turtlesim in Dashing. You just need to use the latest version which is 1.0.2 in Dashing.
