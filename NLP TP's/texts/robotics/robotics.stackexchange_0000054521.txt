Q:

pcl_ros(hydro) fails to compile on Mac OSX 10.8.5

Here is what I get compiling Hydro on OSX 10.8.5 Particularly I get the following errors during pcl_ros compilation.
       /Users/artemlenskiy/ros/hydro/src/pcl_ros/src/pcl_ros/features/feature.cpp:50:10: fatal error: 'pcl/io/io.h' file not found
    #include <pcl/io/io.h>
...

The reason is IO is turned off in homebrew PCL, and therefore the headers are missing.
Does William of anyone else know how to overcome this problem?
Thanks in advance!

You should be able to:
brew uninstall pcl
brew update
brew install pcl

To resolve the issue.
