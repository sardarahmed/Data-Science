Q:

PCL undefined reference to boost

Hi guys, I'm currently using Ubuntu 11.04 and install ROS via the source code method. I'm new and tried to play around with the erratic_robot example. When trying to do a rosmake, I came across a perception_pcl problem when compiling, the pcl folder in particular. Heres a snippet of the build_output.log:
/home/walter/ros/perception_pcl/pcl/build/pcl/build/io:
../libpcl_io.so.1.1.1: undefined reference to boost::system::system_category()' ../libpcl_io.so.1.1.1: undefined reference to boost::filesystem3::detail::status(boost::filesystem3::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'
../libpcl_io.so.1.1.1: undefined reference to boost::system::generic_category()' collect2: ld returned 1 exit status make[3]: *** [io/tools/convert_pcd_ascii_binary] Error 1 make[3]: Leaving directory /home/walter/ros/perception_pcl/pcl/build/pcl/build'
make[2]: *** [io/tools/CMakeFiles/convert_pcd_ascii_binary.dir/all] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory /home/walter/ros/perception_pcl/pcl/build/pcl/build' make[1]: *** [all] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory /home/walter/ros/perception_pcl/pcl/build/pcl/build'
make: *** [installed] Error 2
Any ideas? Thanks.

A:

Hi,
Pls check the version of the boost library in your system. It has to be >= 1.46.1.
Hope this helps,
Karthik

Thanks for the response. ROS electric is set to use boost 1.42 (part of rosdep.yaml). I've installed boost 1.48 manually, however I don't know how to set ROS to use 1.48. It seems I should modify the rosdep.yaml file however I can't figure out how to do it correctly in the proper format.
Thanks,
WW

You just have to compile everything from source after upgrading boost.
