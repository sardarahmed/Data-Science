What type of camera are you using? Webcam or some else?

please help me

Actually, the problem is you are not getting the image from webcam, just using image_view can't show you image. You have to get the image on image:=/Image/topic. If you were using usb webcam it would have been much easier but for integrated webcam i am not able to find any package for indigo.

But i have just written my own package for integrated laptop webcam. I will try to upload and give you link here.

A:

Just download package from this link  extract it in your work_space/src run catkin_make and then rosrun webcam_pub webcam_pub.
Then you can use image_view image_view image:=/webcam/image_raw

I think you were missing roscore. What do you want to know about image processing? Do you know openCV?
Comment by fatima on 2015-12-12:
yes thats right roscore was missing, now its working, i know opencv a little but think may be i could work with image_proc but it looks like opencv is the only way rights?
Comment by Ameer Hamza Khan on 2015-12-12:
Image_proc is only used for image rectification. For general purpose application u should use OpenCV. I suggest to start with this tutorial. Although written for visual studio for windows but you can easily use it in linux. It will give u general intro of openCV.

Hello,
I am also new to ROS and I am facing the same problem, can you please send me the link again, because the one in your comment above is not working anymore
Comment by Ameer Hamza Khan on 2016-02-10:
@Marouane  Here is the link
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6L50j9T2roKNTBPelpJUnJKbjg/view?usp=sharing
To change the webcam, you need to change the cv::VideoCapture cap(0) line in main function.

@Ameer thank you very much for your help, I was able to better understand how everything is working.
