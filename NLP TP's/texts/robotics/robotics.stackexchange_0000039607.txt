Q:

rosrun & node_name

With the advice from Lorenz I was able to resolve the errors I had when running rosmake.  However I tried to launch rosrun but found that I am not using the correct node_name.  Actually, I (incorrectly) assumed that after rosmake run completed one of the outputs would the creation of the node_name.  Can anyone tell me how is the node_name created and where do I look for it?
Thanks,
Gene

A:

In ROS there are separate names for packages, executables and nodes. Rosmake creates an executable file for each node. The default node name will be the string it passes to ros::init(), but that name can be overridden:
$ rosrun my_package node_executable __name:=my_node1

The equivalent roslaunch command is:
<node package="my_package" type="node_executable" name="my_node1"/>

thanks for the info. A minor issue that: it should be
<node package="my_package" type="node_executable" name="my_node1"/>

You're right, I updated the answer.

This doesn't seem to be supported for all nodes. Specifying __name when running rqt_image_view is ignored, and the node still uses an auto-generated node name like "/rqt_gui_cpp_node_12409".
