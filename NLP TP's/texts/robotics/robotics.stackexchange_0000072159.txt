Q:

Converting ros::time to double value without uint_t

I had a look at the ros::durationBase and it has functions toSec toNsec to convert the following into one int64_t which would exceed a double in c++;
int32_t     nsec
int32_t     sec

A:

Both, ros::durationBase (API Doc) as well as ros::timeBase (API Doc) contain the respective toSec() functions which return a double.  What you did is not required!

So this is also ok? ( I could not get it to run with the function first)
double h_time = h.stamp.toSec();
