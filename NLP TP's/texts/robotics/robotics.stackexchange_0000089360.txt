Q:

Get the location of executables of nodes

What should I do if I want to find the path to the executable for the node spawner  in the package controller_manager ?
bryant@bryant:~$ roscd controller_manager        
bryant@bryant:/opt/ros/kinetic/share/controller_manager$ ls
cmake  package.xml

You may want to look at how rosrun finds executables. Be warned, it's a bit of a mess to keep compatibility with rosbuild packages: https://github.com/ros/ros/blob/kinetic-devel/tools/rosbash/scripts/rosrun#L71

A:

Please see #q209051.
