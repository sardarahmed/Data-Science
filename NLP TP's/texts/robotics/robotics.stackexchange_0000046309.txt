A:

ccny_vision is a stack which provides the ar_pose package, which is a system to track visual markers.
It was released by the CCNY Robotics lab several years ago, but unfortunately, no one is currently in charge of maintaining it here, which is why the wiki page headers (and possibly other things) are broken.
