Q:

ROS navigation without amcl / localization?

Hi,
Is it possible to run ROS navigation without amcl or any kind of localization? I still want to a static map that I built using gmapping, just don't want any localization.
Would that mean I should publish a zero transform from /map to /odom? My tree earlier was map -> odom -> base_link and amcl used to publish the transform from map to odom.
EDIT: I did the above but I am unable to set the initial pose of the robot in the map using rviz.
Thank you.

A:

The solution was quite simple. You cannot set the initialpose using rviz since odom and map are the same now. So I reflected the initialpose into the static transform that I am publishing from map to odom.
