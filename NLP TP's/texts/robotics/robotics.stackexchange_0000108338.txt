Q:

base_footprint of articulated vehicle

I have a conceptual doubt. The base_footprint for a vehicle is given with respect to the base_link (projected on the 2D plane). I am unable to comprehend what happens when we have an articulated vehicle. How is the base_footprint then defined. Is it that we define to big polygon defined with respect to the front vehicle base_link or about the coupling point or is it two independent polygons for the two parts of the vehicle (which would make more sense considering a farming vehicle and an attached implement, but then will there be two paths and two controller),  I am unable to understand.
Any help is much appreciated.

A:

What you are asking is quite an interesting topic, and think there are multiple solutions.
When it comes to defining the base_footprint, I position it at ground level directly beneath the pivot point. Following a child link in the pivot point and then two childs to front and rear.
Nav2 have one reference frame when navigating, but does not mean u need two path planners or controllers. Essentially, one should design a controller capable of changing the reference frame between the front and rear based on the direction of the path(forward/reverse). At least that worked for me.
For the footprint, you'll only need 1 big polygon footprint, that uses the articulated angle feedback to dynamically change its footprint. What Marcus suggested works, but will introduce challenges in small spaces. Keep in mind that articulated vehicle such as tractors with equipment are very large, so the robot radius could results in 10-20m.
