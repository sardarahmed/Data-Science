Q:

Which source variant contains ros_control?

Hi
I would like to build Hydro from source to specifically use ros_control. What is the variant that contains ros_control, or does ros_control need to built separately from source? If so how?

A:

The robot variant doesn't include ros_control however:
You can download the zip for ros_control from git and include the extracted ros_control-hydro-devel folder with your other source folders in ~/ws_catkin/src during the install. Catkin will pick it up during make call.
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install

Otherwise outside of installation, see the catkin Tutorial on building and using catkin packages in a workspace.
