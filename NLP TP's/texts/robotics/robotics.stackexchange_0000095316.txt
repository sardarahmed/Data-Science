Q:

IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'params.yaml'

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams
$ rosparam dump params.yaml

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/bin/rosparam", line 35, in <module>
    rosparam.yamlmain()
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosparam/__init__.py", line 620, in yamlmain
    _rosparam_cmd_get_dump(command, argv)
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosparam/__init__.py", line 444, in _rosparam_cmd_get_dump
    dump_params(arg, script_resolve_name(NAME, ns), verbose=options.verbose)
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosparam/__init__.py", line 299, in dump_params
    f = open(filename, 'w')
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'params.yaml'

Where is params.yaml? Need I create it before this command?

A:

Replace  with the name of your ROS distribution (e.g. indigo, jade, kinetic, lunar...):
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt ros-<distro>-rqt-common-plugins ros-<distro>-turtlesim

NOTE: you may have already built rqt and turtlesim for one of the previous tutorials. If you are not sure, installing them again will not hurt anything.

Is this an answer? Or an update?
It's unclear to me how installing rqt solves a permission problem.
