Q:

ROS Packages vs. Linux Packages

In general, how do ROS packages differ from Linux packages?  Can I expect to use them to install libraries and other software, in the way I expect RPM and DEB packages to manage software installation in Linux?  I would like to update the wiki pages to make any distinctions clearer to those coming from Ubuntu backgrounds.  Thanks, friends!

A:

ROS packages are not related to standard linux packages such as RPMs and debian packages.
ROS packages are described on the wiki at http://www.ros.org/wiki/Packages
On Ubuntu you can install debian packages of ROS stacks which contain ROS packages.
