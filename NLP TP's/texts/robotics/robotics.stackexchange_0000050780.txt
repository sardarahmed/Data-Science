Q:

ros-groovy-pcl problem

Hi,
I have installed pcl in ubuntu with command:
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-pcl

When I try compile the example of tutrial I have the nex error:
openni_grabber.h no such file or directory

I look in io folder and the library openni_grabber isn't.
Could anyone help me?
Thanks.

A:

Note that standalone pcl will collide with ros_pcl and anything build on top of it.  You may have better luck with pcl17 http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl17

You are right. I am currently using Fuerte as well as Groovy. My answer works on Fuerte as it has PCL version 1.5.

@Tfoote, Henmu: the better way to install both pcl and ros is using pcl17? it looks complicated in pcl17 page whereas the installation of pcl (at pointcloud.org) and ros normal install is straightforward. Is there any other way to fix this collision?

If you use newer versions of ROS it uses pcl 1.7. Moving large systems takes time and we need to make sure to provide stability to our users. In Hydo we package pcl 1.7. In Indigo it will use the upstream version.

@tfoote : I was just trying to resolve the collision between standalone opencv library and the one provided by ROS. I came across a idea of creating my own 'Find***.cmake' for the standalone library file. Do you think it can help to prevent the collision even if pcl_ros and standalone pcl are of same version but different installation paths?

@Hemu you can try, but I don't think that's the biggest problem. I expect by jumping versions around you're going to run into actual differences in the code, not just packaging issues. Both can be found adaquately, but they cannot be used simultaneously due to collisions.
