Q:

How to modify ros-launch file?

Hello, I'm using ROS kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
I've ever modified existing ROS-launch files some times, but all I did was to change the parameter's name or values.
This time I want to add another node into the launch file, and I'm pretty wondering above whether I have to modify CMakelist.txt or any other files to make sure I'll use another node.
Is it OK if I add some lines into the launch file without any modification on the files kinds of CMakelist.txt?
And also, can I include a node which is in another workspace?
I mean,
<include file="$(find A DIRECTORY FROM ANOTHER WORKSPACE)/THE_LAUNCHFILE.launch" >

is the above OK?
Thanks in advance :)

There is a little tutorial here explainning how to write a launch file.

Don't hesitate to try and see what happen ;) The answer is yes, CMakeLists.txt files are used to build your packages while launch file will simply look for the executables created after the building.

And also, can I include a node which is in another workspace?

Just to be clear : you include launch files but not nodes.
You can do that, it's called workspace chaining.
