I'm guessing, this is pretty much this question...

that problem I just simply use
roslaunch leddar leddar.launch
instead of github provide one. Then the problem was solved. now is that I can connect the leddar eva kit but just a while it will died then reconnect back again, repeating the problem until totally failure

A:

Hello! I had the same problem. I think that my Leddar was configured so that its measurement rate was max. Maybe too many data sent caused troubles... So, I changed 'Accumulation' and 'Oversampling' in order to decrease the measurement rate (see user guide of Leddar Evaluation Kit p28) and it fixed it.
To change the configuration, I modified src/leddar/src/leddar.cpp :
Search for LeddarSetProperty(Handler, PID_ACCUMULATION_EXPONENT, 0, config.accumulations);
and LeddarSetProperty(Handler, PID_OVERSAMPLING_EXPONENT, 0, config.oversampling);
I changed config.accumulations by 7 and config.oversampling by 3 so that measurement rate becomes 12.5 Hz.
I am looking for a smarter way to configure my Leddar, but it's working for now.
