Q:

local variable 'logger' referenced before assignment?

Using fresh install ROS indigo with Ubuntu 14.04
When trying to start openni2_launch I get below error.
What could be wrong?
ros@host1:~$ roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
[openni2.launch] is neither a launch file in package [openni2_launch] nor is [openni2_launch] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
Traceback (most recent call last):openni2_launch
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/bin/roslaunch", line 35, in <module>
    roslaunch.main()
  File "/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 292, in main
    logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'logger' referenced before assignment

A:

roslaunch is complaining that it can't find the openni2_launch package. Do you have it installed?
Try:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni2-launch
