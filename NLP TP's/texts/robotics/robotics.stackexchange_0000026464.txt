Q:

Set Odometry and SetModelState

For repeated tests, I want to move my robot back to (0,0). I've been using SetModelState, but that does not reset the odometry. Is there a way to reset the odometry easily?
I found LAYER_POSITION2D_REQ_SET_ODOM here but it's unclear how to use it from ROS.
Edit: I'm using the basic PR2 setup in conjunction with ROS. I create an empty world and spawn a PR2 in it. The /base_odometry/odom topic is published by the /gazebo node.

what robot and which odometry are you talking about? Where do you get the odometry from, a plugin?

A:

Hi David,
PR2 odometry information is published by a ROS odometry controller.  All controllers in gazebo are loaded through a gazebo plugin that mimics the PR2 controller manager on the robot.  Gazebo itself does not keep odometry information.
