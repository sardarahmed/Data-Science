Q:

add_message_files() directory not found:

I'm absolute beginner in Ubuntu and ROS. I'm using 12.04 LTS (virtualbox in windows 7) and groovy. I'm using catkin to build my workspace. This is what I did
1- I did create workspace for catkin.
2- I did create "catkin Package".
3- I did build and use catkin package in the workspace.
4- Now I want to use the example WritingPublisherSubscriber(c++)
I'm getting the following error

CMake Error at
/opt/ros/groovy/share/genmsg/cmake/genmsg-extras.cmake:64
(message):   add_message_files()
directory not found:
/home/croco/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/msg
Call Stack (most recent call first):
beginner_tutorials/CMakeLists.txt:8
(add_message_files)
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! Invoking "cmake" failed

I'm sorry I can't post links; however, I'm following the tutorials literally.

A:

The tutorial seems to need an update. Please try commenting out the following three lines in your CMakeLists.txt:
# add_message_files(FILES Num.msg)
# add_service_files(FILES AddTwoInts.srv)
# generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES std_msgs)

Those are not necessary since this tutorial does not create any custom messages or services.
