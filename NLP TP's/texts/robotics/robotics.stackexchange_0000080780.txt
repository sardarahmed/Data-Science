Q:

amcl tuning for better localization

Hi all,
I'm pretty desperate right now because I can't figure out where my mistake is. I hope someone can enlighten me.
When I try to localize my robot (while driving) the laserscan data moves with it (but it should stay on the obstacles in the static map I use). In detail: I set the robots pose with the "2D Pose Estimate". I drive towards a wall (using robot steering) and as the robot approaches the wall the laserscan data moves towards the robot. As a result of that the robot does not localize properly. Here are two screenshots of rviz for better visualization (before and after driving)
Can anyone give me a hint into the right direction?
Any help would be appreciated!

please, post your amcl config and your tf tree.
is this a real robot or a simulation? how are you generating your odometry?

A:

I'm sorry for the late reply. Thank you for your help but I figured out the problem. It was in the base_controller responsible for handling the cmd_vel commands.

What was the reason for the error in laserscan data
