Q:

gazebo 1.6.7 in ros fuerte problems

Hello,
I'm working on ros fuerte with gazebo, yesterday i installed the version of simultaor gazebo 1.6.7 because i need to work with the contact sensors of the shadow_hand and the version that i have (1.6.16) has a problem with the contact_sensors, the installation was ok, but when i open my gazebo y too slow, then i try to run it in headless mode but it doesn't open it remains freeze.
When i run the gazebo normally i try to spawn the shadow hand but it doesn't appear, i don't know what is happening, someone knows what is wrong???
Runing in headless mode:
jose@ubuntu:~$ roslaunch gazebo_worlds empty_world_no_x.launch

A:

Gazebo is a stand-alone package. Please do not use the version of Gazebo that ships with ROS. The version within ROS is old and unsupported.
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/install describes how to install Gazebo.
Do not follow any of the Gazebo tutorials on the ROS website. They are old and unmaintained. Only use the tutorials on http://gazebosim.org/wiki
You can still use ROS Fuerte, but you should install Gazebo from the repository hosted by OSRF.

hey, i went out for a long time, i just read your anser and i installed the gazebo like you said to me, it works but the problem is when i need to work with ros and gazebo the tow applications are not bound, it works like a independient applications... any idea?

Can you explain your problem in more detail? Gazebo has always been a stand alone application (not tied to ROS).

Is @hsu just committing to the simulator_gazebo stack for kicks? https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/changeset/40366
Comment by hsu on 2013-03-13:
@jbohren well, it is fun, you should try it sometimes  :)  trying to spin up another groovy release with gazebo 1.5.  turns out some of these test worlds might end up as gazebo unit tests directly in gazebo.
Comment by jbohren on 2013-03-13:
@hsu (: I might if I still had commit access to ros-pkg. I was actually going to create a branch to add something a couple months ago. Any thoughts on migrating that to git/hg/github/bitbucket?
