Q:

Choosing motor for a tricopter

I'm a newbie in RC field..I am planning to construct my first Tricopter ever.  Can anyone help me to find the power rating to select the motor for a tricopter?
I am at the beginning stage of construction.  Arm length of frame: 50cm each.  I need a thrust of about 2Kg -- nearly 666 gms for each motor.

A:

This depends on what you want to do with your copter.
Hovering:                              100-150 Watt/kg 
ScaleFlight:                           200-300 Watt/kg 
Some chilling acrobatic flight:        350-400 Watt/kg 
3D acrobatics                          500+ Watt/kg 
Hardcore 3D                            1000 Watt/kg 
Just take the real weight of your copter, calculate the total power and divide it by 3 (in your case)
I also have a source for this but i know only a German one:
