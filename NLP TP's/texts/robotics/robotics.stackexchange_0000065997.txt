Q:

p2os_urdf pioneer3dx bug

Hello,
I'm trying to simulate a pionner like this one (pionner3dx), but when I run the launch file in the package p2os_urdf. pioneer3dx_urdf.launch I get a bugged robot. The wheel is out of place. I think there is a bad definition on the swife joint. Is probably out of place.
I get he following robot in Rviz.

Paulo.

A:

I went into the p2os and copied the pioneer3dx.urdf and I used my own launch file and I got a good result. No problem in the URDF file.
