Q:

Without using slam gmapping!

Hello,
I just want to know whether we can give our predefined map of an office room without using slam gmapping? I want to use laser and camera in the robot, and with the help of both obstacles of the given map can be avoided?
Will it be a problem if I want to write my own navigation stack with my own map?
I am using USARSim simulator on windows& and ROS Groovy on Ubuntu11.10.

A:

You don't really mention it in your question, but I guess you want the robot to localize itself on a given a map using lidar data? For that I suggest having a look at http://wiki.ros.org/amcl

It's all open source, everything is possible :). You can of course write your own navigation stack. However, there are already solutions available in ROS for mapping/localization/path planning/obstacle avoidance.

If I don't want to go for amcl as well and try to build a visibility graph (or occupancy map) from sensor data, then will it be a problem ? # jodafo
