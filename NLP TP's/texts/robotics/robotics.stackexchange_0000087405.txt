Q:

I can't install rosbridge_suite

Hello I try installing rosbridge_suite on ubuntu 18.04 with melodic.
I tried

sudo apt install ros-kinetic-rosbridge-server
sudo apt install ros-indigo-rosbridge-server
sudo apt install ros-melodic-rosbridge-server

and also

sudo apt install ros-kinetic-rosbridge-suite
sudo apt install ros-indigo-rosbridge-suite
sudo apt install ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite

I can't get it. Always the message "Unable to locate package ros--rosbridge-suite" or "Unable to locate package ros--rosbridge-server".
What I do wrong?

Nothing really, other than not checking whether rosbridge_suite is actually released into ROS Melodic.
As you can see both on the wiki page that you link us to (note how the version selector right under the package name at the top of the page doesn't have a button for melodic), as well as on status_page/ros_melodic_default.html?q=rosbridge, the package(s) simply hasn't (haven't) been released yet for Melodic.
So apt telling you it can't find the package is actually correct.

I read that but thought I can still install a older version?

No, you cannot install kinetic or indigo packages on Ubuntu Bionic, as those ROS versions are simply not supported on Bionic.

Thank you very much. I tried to additionally install the package in a ROS Melodic docker file. But than I go with a ROS Kinetic docker file.
