Q:

camera_calibration runs but cannot calibrate

Hi all,
I tried to calibrate my Firefly MV Firewire camera with the provided ROS Indigo package.
So I ran roscore and camera1394, and then the command on the wiki.
The wiki says that to start the calibration I have to press the Calibrate Button but it is gray and nothing happens when I press it.
Anyone can help me?
I use Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo.
This is the command I ran:
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x5 --square 0.030 image:=/camera/image_raw camera:=/camera

A:

You have to collect the samples first, then the the 'calibrate' button will be enabled
