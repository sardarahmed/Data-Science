Q:

import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('organizer') error

Hi, I'm new to ROS so probably my error is silly. I'm trying to run this open source project on Baxter. I have pasted the master branch under ros_ws/src. When I try to run the right_hand_camera_srv.py file like that, rosrun organizer-baxter-master right_hand_camera_srv.py, I'm getting the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/anton/ros_ws/src/organizer-baxter-master/src/right_hand_camera_srv.py", line 3, in <module>

ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/anton/ros_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

What am I doing wrong?

A:

This looks like a rosbuild package.
It looks like it's expecting to be placed in a folder named organizer but instead you've placed it in a folder named organizer-baxter-master. You may want to try renaming the folder to see if that helps.
