Q:

How do I get depth_image_proc?

The package summary for depth_image_proc say it is new in ROS Electric however my Electric (OSX 10.7.3) doesn't have it installed under the image_pipeline folder. I tried updating my ROS Electric using "rosinstall ." but nothing got downloaded/updated that gave me depth_image_proc. Is there a proper way to update my Electric install to get this or is it really an experimental package that I must manually install using SVN?

It isn't present on my Ubuntu 11.10 Electric install either. It is present in image_pipeline in my Fuerte install from .debs. Perhaps that should be "new in Fuerte"?

A:

depth_image_proc was indeed introduced in ROS Electric, but in the openni_kinect stack. In Fuerte I've moved it to image_pipeline as it should be useful for working with 3D cameras in general, not only the Kinect.
I'll make a note in the wiki docs.
