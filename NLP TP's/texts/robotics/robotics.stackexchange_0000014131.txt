Q:

Rate random walk from datasheet MPU6050

i have been trying to extract rate random walk paramater from the data sheet but couldnt find any clue ...
is there any way to do  that or what ? how should it be calculated  ?
thanks !

A:

As far as I am aware, figures for random noise coefficients like the Rate Random Walk, or Drifting balance, are not usually included in accelerometer or gyro datasheets (not just the MPU-6050).
Values are normally obtained by creating an Allan Deviation plot as described in this Application Note from Freescale Semiconductor.
I did a brief online search, and I found a paper describing the process for calculating and plotting the Allan deviation function to obtain the Rate Random Walk for an IMU-based attitude sensor using the MPU-6050, which might contain the information you are looking for.
