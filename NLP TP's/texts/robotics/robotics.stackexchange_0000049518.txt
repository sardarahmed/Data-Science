Q:

Subscriber issue

What should I do if I want that the callBack function of a subscriber returns a value. In particular I have a subscriber that receive sensor_msgs/Range and I want the callBack function to return the range value that is in the message but I don't now how to implement it.
Any suggestion?
Thanks in advance

A:

Callback cannot return values.
Where would you want to have that value returned to?

You could take an example from the talker tutorial, to communicate to the sender of the original message.

That's what services are for.

I want it returned in the main where I declare the subscriber

You just want to have the message value available in the main? You could write it to a global variable or better use boost::bind for the callback and pass in a reference to the value to write to.
