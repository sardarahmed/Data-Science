Q:

Python Numpy Error

Hi I am following this tutorial to use numpy with rospy
http://wiki.ros.org/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/numpy
when I am running

rosrun numpy_tutorial
numpy_listener.py

I am getting the following error

terminate called after throwing an
instance of 'rospack::Exception'
what():  error parsing manifest of
package numpy_tutorial at
/home/tanmay/catkin_ws/numpy_tutorial/package.xml

any suggestions what I might be doing incorrectly?
Thanks,
TM

Im getting an error: [rospack] Error: package 'numpy_tutorial' not found

A:

Not sure what the exact problem is, but the error is pretty clear -- package.xml in numpy_tutorial is unparseable. Perhaps post the contents of that file and we can debug what is actually wrong with it.
(as for why you're even parsing package.xml, you've made a call to roslib.load_manifest().. it should be noted, that this is not needed for an actual catkin package, and in fact, is generally recommended not to do with a catkin package. You might try removing that line also. Regardless, I'd guess that tutorial is out of date)
