Q:

Custom Message Creation

I've followed the ros tutorial for creating a custom message, but I'm unsure as to where to put it. Does it go in ros_workspace/package/msg/CustomMessage.msg? Or does it go into opt/ros/electric/stacks? If so, where exactly?
I'm making a node to publish a Vehicle.msg message filled by the Joy driver. I'm using the turtle_teleop_joy tutorial as my base. I need the custom message to define the axes.

A:

Your first suggestion is correct. You put it in the msg directory of your message package. Make sure you then update the CMakeLists.txt to add the rosbuild_genmsg() option. Also, be sure to make any package using this message to depend on your message package (unless your messages are located in the same package as your node).

Thanks! I thought this was the source of my error, but I see it successfully generated the msg_gen folder and files in the package folder.

Also if other packages need to use the custom message from package A, make sure the manifest of package A exports the include cflags.

@Ivan Dryanovski: I believe the CFLAGS export is provided automatically, now.
