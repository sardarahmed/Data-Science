Q:

Issues with setting up models

I want to clone the models repository on my system, so I followed this step from the documentation:
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models
This gives the error:
abort: error: _ssl.c:510: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number
Okay, then I opened Gazebo gui and opened the Insert tab. Which shows the following messages:
/home/xxx/.gazebo/models
/usr/share/gazebo-6.5/models
Connecting to model database...
And, nothing else. I don't think it is able to connect to the models database.
I'm working behind a proxy. Is there a way for gazebo to use these proxy settings?
Or, bypassing all this, can I simply download the models from my browser, without Mercurial or anything else? Why such a roundabout way for downloading models?
