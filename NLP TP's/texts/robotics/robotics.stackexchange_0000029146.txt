Q:

How to pass parameters to GUIPlugin for gzclient

I need to run a separate node with Gazebo client like this:
<node name="gui_w_plugin" pkg="ros_gazebo" type="gzclient" args="--gui-client-plugin libgui_plugin.so"/>

However I was not able to pass any arguments to the plugin. I was also not able to find much documentation to GUIPlugin (but very brief API description).
Do you have an idea, how to:

pass arguments to plugin, so I can use tem in C++ plugin definition (either constructor or Load())?

start gazebo client other way, so I can use SDF parameters or other means?

Thank you!

A:

In the end, I used kind of workaround to pass arguments via local ROS parameter. However, I don't think this is the best way and I would find the most elegant way to be able to specify the sdf parameters even with node call.
