Q:

Creating /tf (position) from IMU, 2D/3D SLAM (LiDAR+IMU+Octomap) (no need for high accuracy))

Hello,
Iam trying to build a simple SLAM system consisted of:

RPLiDAR A2 M8
Razor IMU 9DOF M0

used packages:

octomap_mapping,
razor_imu_9dof    (razor-pub.launch)
rplidar_ros    (rplidar.launch)

own packages

mctr-132_ros (sends transform of
world 0,0,0 and transform of laser
which has location 0,0,0 and
orientation is quaternion from imu)
mctr-132_laser (only converting
LaserScan to PointCloud)

System: Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic
Iam in the phase that I put those points into map and I can visualize it in Rviz, but I only take IMU rotation into account. The position is being published into the /tf topic as 0, 0, 0. I can therefore build map of the surrounding environment. But I'd like to move my device around. So I need a proper /tf with position transform.
I was thinking about robot_pose_ekf, but it needs odometry and I have no idea how to create fake odometry from 9dof imu.
Q1: Is it possible to create fake odometry from IMU and if so how?
Many thanks
ps.: I would upload also a photo but 5 points are required...
ps.: I tried google cartographer, hector_localization, rf2o_laser_odometry but I failed to build/run them...

Hello! I am sorry I am really late to this thread but heres how I would do it, I would also love to hear how you ended up building your SLAM system.

Use a visual odometry software like a laser_scan_matcher (http://wiki.ros.org/laser_scan_matcher) or ICP odometry from rtabmap or hector_mapping (http://wiki.ros.org/hector_mapping) to emulate wheel_odometry data from the RPLiDAR
Fuse the visual odometry with IMU yaw and acceleration using the robot_localization package (This will give you a reliable odometry data source odom->base_link)
Use LiDAR data to build map and publish loop closures using rtabmap/ cartographer to correct the odometry drift (map ->odom)

Thanks!
