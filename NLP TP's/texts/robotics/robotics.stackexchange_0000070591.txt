Q:

Indigo ros_core source compile error in actionlib_msgs

I'm compiling indigo-ros_core from source on Debian and I'm getting stuck at actionlib_msgs with the following error:
<== Finished processing package [43 of 63]: 'std_msgs'

==> Processing catkin package: 'actionlib_msgs'
==> Building with env: '/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh'

CMake Error at /home/crunchex/uproot/iso_catkin_ws/build_isolated/actionlib_msgs/cmake/actionlib_msgs-genmsg.cmake:3 (message):
  Could not find messages which
  '/home/crunchex/uproot/iso_catkin_ws/src/common_msgs/actionlib_msgs/msg/GoalStatusArray.msg'
  depends on.  Did you forget to specify generate_messages(DEPENDENCIES ...)?

  Cannot locate message [Header] in package [std_msgs] with paths
  [['/home/crunchex/uproot/iso_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/std_msgs/share/std_msgs/cmake/../msg']]
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /home/crunchex/uproot/iso_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/genmsg/share/genmsg/cmake/genmsg-extras.cmake:304 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:12 (generate_messages)

At this point, I've already finished processing std_msgs, which is where the Header message is defined. So I'm not really sure why it would be failing at this point. Anyone have a clue?

Not a solution, just a fyi: there is a packaging effort for Debian underway at DebianScience/Robotics/ROS. Might save you some time/trouble.

Great! Thanks, I will check it out.

A:

Found a workaround to the problem, but I think there is still some sort of bug in the actionlib_msgs dependencies.
Since my original command, part of the official Debian Indigo installation process, is this:
sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/indigo

The packages that were built successfully up to the point where actionlib_msgs fails, will make it into /opt/ros/indigo. If I source that workspace and try the same command again, then the build will work fine (63/63). Not sure why this is.
Update: turned out to be a permissions thing. This answer pointed me in the right direction: http://answers.ros.org/question/59178/catkin_make_isolated-fails-with-install-space-optrosgroovy/?answer=59180#post-id-59180
