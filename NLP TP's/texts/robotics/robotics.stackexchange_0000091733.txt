Q:

Docker pull ros returns no matching manifest

Hello guys, I am trying to pull ros using docker but I got the following error:
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/ros
no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries

I installed ROS Kinetic on Linux (Dont think it matters) and here are my info for Ubuntu:
4.15.0-45-generic #48~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 29 18:03:19 UTC 2019 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux

I suspect the reason for this is the fact that I am using a 32-bit laptop instead of 64-bit. Its there any way to pull the ros image on a 32-bit computer?
The image I was trying to pull is:
Sudo Docker pull ros

You don't show the image you're trying to pull, so your question is hard to answer.

A:

According to docker success center: Error pulling image : no matching manifest the problem would indeed be that you're trying to pull an image for an unsupported OS/arch combination.

I'm not aware of official i386 images. The tags on hub.docker.com/ros also seem to suggest only amd64, arm64 and arm are supported. The Supported Architectures under Quick Reference also states that:

Supported architectures: (more info)

amd64, arm32v7, arm64v8

It should be doable to build 32bit images yourself though: changing this line to read i386/ubuntu:xenial should work.
At least for Kinetic. There are no i386 builds for Melodic any more (Lunar dropped this support: see REP 3: Architectures).
