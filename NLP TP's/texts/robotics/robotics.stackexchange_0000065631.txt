Q:

A simple C# GUI for ROS

Dear All,
I wonder that if there is any possibility to write a simple Web-based or desktop-based GUI in C# for ROS. To be more clearer,foe example, if I write a simple desktop GUI in C# with Mono, How can I make connection with this desktop application and ROS? Do I use Rosbridge? How?
Thanks,

A:

I think the easiest by far is probably making use of ros_bridge. That will allow you to interact with a ROS node graph using JSON messages. No (direct) ROS dependencies in your C# application, and it would also make it possible to run it on Windows.
An alternative might be to use an actual ROS client library in c# (or any .net language, really). ros.net appears to be one, although I cannot say anything about how feature complete it is.

Edit: for video, people apparently use mjpeg_server.
