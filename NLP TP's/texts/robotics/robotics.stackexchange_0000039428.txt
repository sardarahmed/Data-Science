Q:

Is there a minimum tag size on answers.ros.org?

Don't know if it is just me or answers.ros.org. When I search "osx" I get no returned questions. When I search "lion" I get a bunch of questions returned, most with the "osx" tag attached. Is this just me or is this a bug/feature? I also do not get anything if I search "ROS" which leads me to think a tag must be at least 4 letters long.
