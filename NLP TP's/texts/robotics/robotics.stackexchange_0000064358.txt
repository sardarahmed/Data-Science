Q:

Hector Slam input IMU data

Hi there,
I am running hector_slam in ROS Hydro with a Neato XV-11 laser and a Razor 9dof IMU.
The IMU has been included via hector_imu_attitude_to_tf.
In RViz everything looks good, I have a base_footprint frame that only moves on X and Y (and yaw) and attached to it a base_link frame that has additional roll and pitch movement.
Now my question is this:
Right now the IMU data is only transforming a frame but I guess that has no direct effect on the computation of hector_slam? Do I have to specify somewhere that hector_slam should consider the IMU data to increase its own accuracy? Or do I have to run an additional node for that, like hector_localization?

A:

hector_slam only uses (roll/pitch) imu data implicitly by transforming the scan through tf. It would be possible to for example use IMU data for improving the scan-matching start estimate, but this is currently not implemented.

Dear Stefan,
I have a question about this issue.
I read the pdf below.
http://tedusar.eu/cms/sites/tedusar.eu.cms/files/Hector_SLAM_USAR_Kohlbrecher_RRSS_Graz_2012.pdf
On page 32, you explained the Handheld Mapping System has IMU.
Does IMU has no direct effect on the computation of hector_slam?
