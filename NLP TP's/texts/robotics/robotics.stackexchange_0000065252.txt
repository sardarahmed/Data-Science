Q:

How can I visualize the costs of the proxemics layer?

Hi,
I am trying to use the social navigation layer of the people stack. I have a node which gives me the relative positions of the people in front of the depth camera and I would like to incorporate this information into the navigation costmap. So far I can see the added social layer in the costmap when I run rqt_reconfigure but I was wondering if there is a way to visualize the costs of that layer in rviz.

A:

You can visualize the costmap by adding a Map type display to rviz connected to the COSTMAP_NAMESPACE/costmap topic. This assumes that COSTMAP_NAMESPACE/publish_frequency is greater than 0.

Thank you for your response. My social costmap was not properly configured. That was why I could not see it in the local or global costmap visualization.
