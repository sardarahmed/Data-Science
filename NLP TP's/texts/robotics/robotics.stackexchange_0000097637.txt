Q:

fatal error: .h: No such file or directory

I am using ubuntu 18.04 and ROS melodic. I am trying to build my catkin ws but I got this error.
fatal error: ur5_demo_descartes/ur5_robot_model.h: No such file or directory

The exact path of file is
/home/ros-industrial/catkin_ws/src/ur5_demo_descartes/include/ur5_demo_descartes/ur5_robot_model.h

and I am using this in source file like this:
#include <ur5_demo_descartes/ur5_robot_model.h>

The package also added in the cMakeLists.txt and package.xml. Do you have any idea?

please share your CMakeLists.txt and package.xml (without any comments) or provide a repository to reproduce

Hi, you can check the repo from here: [https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_training/tree/melodic/exercises/Descartes_Planning_and_Execution/solution_ws/src]

Is this the repo that you cannot build? Which package shows the error? Some that you did? You need to be more specific if you expect us to help.
I'm not going to search through a repo with multiple packages or compile this on good luck.
Make sure to provide an SSCCE.

A:

Add  include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}) in your CMakelists.txt file. Or take a look at the next ROS answer.
