Q:

Does SDF format not working with ROS?

Hello
I m at the beginning of simulation a robot. So Before start I made some research for start point. The biggest contradiction that I face up is: Should I start my design with SDF of URFD format. ( I want to use my design in Gazebo, rviz and ROS )
As I read from this article : SDF is a complete description for everything from the world level down to the robot level. And it has also some more advantages like  easy adding and modify elements.
As I read from this article : it is described that difference
between SDF & URFD is ;  URDF works with the rest of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and SDF really only works with Gazebo.
So again the question on that point :
-Does ROS not support the SDF format ?
Thanks

you can use  this video to convert your sdf files to urdf

A:

ROS does not support the SDF format. Gazebo provides the gzsdf tool to translate from URDF to SDF. This article describes how to add Gazebo tags to an URDF file; gzsdf will pass these tags along in the final SDF.
