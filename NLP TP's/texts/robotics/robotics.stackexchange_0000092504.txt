Q:

Creating Waypoints in Autoware?? Creating .txt file

ROS MELODIC
AUTOWARE VERSION: 1.12.0-alpha2
I would like to know how to create waypoints in Autoware such that Car follows that path shown by Waypoints. In demo video, they are using moriyama.txt file but How do I create a custom .txt file for my own simulation??

A:

Waypoints can be created by launching the waypoint_saver node. Once you are localized, run roslaunch waypoint_maker waypoint_saver.launch. This will create a new file in /tmp/saved_waypoints.csv. Stop the launch file to stop recording. You can then load these waypoints with roslaunch waypoint_maker waypoint_loader.launch multi_lane_csv:=/tmp/saved_waypoints.csv.
Note: if you run waypoint_saver more than once without moving or deleting /tmp/saved_waypoints.csv, it will append to the file rather than replacing it. If you then try to load this file with more than one set of waypoints in it, the loader will fail.
Note 2: Autoware 1.12.0 has been officially released. I highly recommend using the released version instead of the alpha or beta.
