A:

That means roscore is not running or you have some network issues. Check if roscore is running and if the problem persists, refer to http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup for problems with your network.

/camera/image_raw"""
but the actual output for me is ""/rosout
/rosout_agg """  ,,, How can I solve this ???

Just to clarify - you expect the output to be "/camera/camera_info   /camera/image_raw", but the actual output is "/rosout /rosout_agg"? If so, you need to make sure the nodes that publish or subscribe to "/camera/camera_info   /camera/image_raw" are running. Run roscore and "rosnode list" to check.

the only output after ""rosnode list" is  """ /rosout """ ????

Okay so that means you haven't started your nodes. You need to do "rosrun package_name node_name". Read the node tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes it should help you.
