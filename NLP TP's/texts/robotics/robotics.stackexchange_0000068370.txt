Q:

Can't run gmapping

I am running gmapping on ROS Indigo. I installed gmapping by
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gmapping
rosmake gmapping

When I run it, I followed this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/slam_gmapping/Tutorials/MappingFromLoggedData
However, when I run
rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan

I got this error:
slam_gmapping: tpp.c:62: __pthread_tpp_change_priority: Assertion `new_prio == -1 || (new_prio >= __sched_fifo_min_prio && new_prio <= __sched_fifo_max_prio)' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
How can I solve this? Any help is much appreciated!
