Q:

Do not know why the master node is not running

I have an iRobot create, and after installing my packages and running a script, I get the error: Unable to register with master node [http://tahoma:11311]: master way not be running yet.
This seems to be a common problem, but I haven't been able to make the troubleshooting solutions work. I ran roscore - no errors pop up, and I expected this would start up the master node. But running the script still returns the original error.
What explanations could there be for the master node to not be running?

A:

It may be a problem with your $ROS_MASTER_URI variable.  That is, roscore is running under a different master URI than the other process.  Try running echo $ROS_MASTER_URI in the terminal running roscore and the terminal running your other process. If they are different you can use export ROS_MASTER_URI=<whatever your roscore master uri is> in the terminal window running the other process to set the variable to the proper URI before running the process. You can also add the export line to your .bashrc file to set the correct ROS_MASTER_URI in every new terminal.
You can read ROS Network Setup for more information on setting up your machine.

It's more likely that you can't reach the master than it's not running.  Go through the network setup guide to make sure you have everything setup correctly.
