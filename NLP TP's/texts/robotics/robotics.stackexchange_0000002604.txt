Q:

Differential drive trajectory following control

I have a robot platform with differential drive which knows it's position and orientation.
Lets say that the space through which the robot moves is known and it has only static obstacles. The task is to move the robot from point A and heading alpha (on which it currently stands) to point B and heading beta on the map.
Lets also say that I can obtain a reasonable trajectory (in relation to the turning abilities of the robot). As both the robot and the sensors are inert, what are some general approaches for controlling such a robot to follow the path? It should of course be kept in mind that the final task is to reach the point B without colliding with the obstacles and not the perfect trajectory following.
I hope the question is not too general.

A:

Pure pursuit is the standard method for following a trajectory with a differential drive (or ackerman steering) robot.  It is a very simple technique.  You should be able to search for it and find some (very old) papers describing it.
