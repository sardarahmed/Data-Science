Q:

Permission Denied: running rosjava pubsub tutorial

I am trying to run the rosjava_tutorial_pubsub tutorial, but every time I try to "rosmake" it, I get the following error about not being able to create "ros.properties." I'm honestly not sure what to do from here, and I've looked through the rest of the answer base. Thanks in advance!

You installed the tutorial in /opt/ros which require root permission to access. You could probably copy the folder to somewhere in your home directory and then add the directory into ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Alternatively, you could run rosmake as root.  PS. the rosjava package may miss a ROS_NOBUILD file.
