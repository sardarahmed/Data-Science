Motor for DIY Electric skateboard

I've been planning to make an electric skateboard for a while now. All the tutorials that I have seen use brushless motors. However, where I live, its not possible to get the exact ones as shown in those tutorials. 
The ones I can buy are somewhat like this.
The one shown in the tutorials is this.
I am new to brushless motors. The one in the tutorial in 270kv and the one I can buy is 1000kv (and above) but they both differ greatly in size. Plus there's this "outrunner" thing. The ones I can buy seem to be made for quadcopters and similar stuff.
So am I okay using the ones I can buy? The little 1000 kv ones, considering the fact that they need to run a 14T to 36T pulley system with approx 70kgs of weight on the board.
Or maybe I could just use the 12v 10Amp 1000RPM DC Motor that I have lying around?

A:

Check the legal requirements of the motors for your area.
The little 1000kV motors wouldn't have sufficient torque...
Look for anything below 600kV and the motor should be equal to or under the legal limit of the motor wattage.
Just to let you know...
kV means RPM per volt
The 'k' is the constant
The 'V' is the volts
So...
1000 kV means 1000 RPM per volt 
Normally, higher kV motors have less torque and they are mainly used for small multicopters
Higher kV would have a lower top speed and much higher torque and they can be used for larger multicopter or projects like electric long board or e-bikes.
