Q:

move_base: failed to create TrajectoryPlannerROS?

Hi folks,
I keep getting the following error message while trying to follow the navigation robot setup tutorial:

Failed to create the base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: MultiLibraryClassLoader: Could not create class of type base_local_planner::TrajectoryPlannerROS

[MoveBase-10] process has died [pid 4134, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/navigation/move_base/bin/move_base __name:=MoveBase __log:=/home/hendrik/.ros/log/a34a5e18-f55d-11e2-9197-0022fb1ea482/MoveBase-10.log].
log file: /home/hendrik/.ros/log/a34a5e18-f55d-11e2-9197-0022fb1ea482/MoveBase-10*.log

It has worked for a while. I don't know what I've done wrong to end up with this. Whatever information you need in order to help me figure out the cause of this problem I'll happily provide if I can.
Thanks!

A:

Got things working again...
bash# apt-get update
...
bash# apt-get upgrade
...

and restarting roscore, rviz and my stack solved the problem.
