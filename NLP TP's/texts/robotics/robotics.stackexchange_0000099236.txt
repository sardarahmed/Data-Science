Q:

gnome-terminal run roslaunch after ssh without closing the terminal

I 'd like to write a file.sh as follows :
#!/bin/bash
gnome-terminal -x bash -c "roslaunch abc slam.launch"
sleep 2s
gnome-terminal -x bash -c "ssh ubuntu@ipaddress; sleep 4s; roslaunch bringup minimal.launch"
sleep 2s
gnome-terminal -x bash -c 'ssh ubuntu@192.168.0.108 "roslaunch lidar scan.launch"'

It runs smoothly for the 1st roslaunch, the second command just ended at login in result of ssh, the last command , it open and  then closed. I tried to change some script inside, and result shown "bash: roslaunch command not found"
How should i do ? thanks !

A:

What are you trying to accomplish here? It looks like you want roslaunch to ssh into a machine and launch the launch file on that machine, but I'm not entirely sure. If this is the case, this functionality is already built in to roslaunch using the machine tag

I want to write a script to use ssh login into a computer and then run roslaunch there.
I already setup ssh login without password
