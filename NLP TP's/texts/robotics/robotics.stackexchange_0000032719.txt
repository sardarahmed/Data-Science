Q:

how to execute rgbdslam by bag file

hi, I'm trying to execute rgbdslam offline by bag files. but I don't know that bag files I made is correct.
I found that rgbdslam subscribe 3 msgs, /camera/rgb/image_mono, /camera/rgb/points, /camera/depth/image. so I tried to create bag files in 2 ways[publish from openni_camera node].

rosbag record -a
rosbag record -O test /camera/rgb/image_mono /camera/rgb/points /camera/depth/image

but 1. occurred error in openni_node running. 2. was OK. but buffer exceed warning was occurred so It has just about 10seconds duration.
What can I do for this work.
answer anything to that. thank you.

Can you post the exact error messages.

A:

For 1: rosbag record -a is almost always the wrong choice; it's a stupendous amount of data. Running it with openni runs you into a limitation of the driver: you can't be connected to the depth and IR streams simultaneously.
For 2: /camera/rgb/points is also a lot of data; roughly 300 meg/sec. That's going to fill your write buffers very quickly. See the accepted answer to my question about RGB6D for a discussion of what quality of data you need to get this working well.
You are recording the correct topics (it doesn't hurt to record /tf, as well).
