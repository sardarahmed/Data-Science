Q:

How to install gtest

According to the ros gtest wiki page (http://wiki.ros.org/gtest):
In ROS 1.0 (Box Turtle) and 1.2 (C Turtle), gtest is included as a ROS package. In later releases of ROS, it has been converted to a rosdep.

However, when I run the command:
$ rosdep install gtest

I get:
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource gtest

The same thing happens if I run the command as root and with I all the variants I can think of (including g-test, googletest, and google-test). So how does one install gtest?

A:

rosdep takes ROS packages as arguments and installs their dependencies.
If you want to install gtest on Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev

I got the above native package name by using
rosdep resolve gtest

If you have a package, foo_package, with a dependency on gtest you can say:
rosdep install foo_package
