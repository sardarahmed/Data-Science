Q:

Groovy Beta install error on OSX

Following the instructions in section 2.2.2, the ROS-Comm install doesn't work. Going to http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/dry/raw/groovy/ros_comm returns the following error:

Both the full-desktop and desktop seem to work fine (they return a list of packages to install).

A:

It looks like you're trying to generate a rosinstall file for a wet stack with the dry toolchain. Can you try this instead?

Yes that returns a list of packages. @WilliamWoodall is leveraging the "install from source" instructions for linux. They want us to build a dry tool chain first it appears. I am just trying to let them know it is broken for ros_comm, but works for the other two.
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2012-12-29:
Yes, this should not be used in the case of ros_comm.  We are intending to replace ros_comm with an actual variant in the future. But the rosinstall generate could give a more meaningful response, like # No dry packages selected or something similar, which would result in an empty rosinstall.
Comment by WilliamWoodall on 2012-12-29:
I updated the installation instructions to reflect this.
