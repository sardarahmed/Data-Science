Q:

Can GZWeb play a gazebo log file?

If we generate a log file using gzserver, can it be replayed in gzweb?

A:

GzWeb is just a visualization tool, it needs a gzserver running in the background.
So you can replay a log on gzserver just like you normally would, and visualize that using GzWeb.

FYI, we're adding log playback control to GzWeb 2.0, see the pull request: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gzweb/pull-requests/101
