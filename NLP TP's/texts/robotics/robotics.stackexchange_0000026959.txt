Q:

Where can i find more info about NoiseModel?

Hi,
I'm working on some camera noises like distortion, aberration etc. I think that I can achieve this easy by modify output images. But this options may by slow.
I prefer to add some shaders that could do in during render. I found here some kind of idea:
http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/611/modelling-of-sensor-noise/
There appear "Sensor noise model". In repository history appear commit that says It worked.
I would like to know something more about "Noise Model" feature.
Are there any information about this?

A:

currently gazebo supports gaussian noise model, and for camera sensors that's done through shaders

unfortunately we don't provide easy hooks to use your custom shaders yet, but if you don't mind a bit of a hack, you can modify gazebo's camera gaussian noise shaders to suit your needs:
The shaders are: /usr/share/gazebo-x.x/media/materials/programs/camera_noise_gaussian_*.glsl
