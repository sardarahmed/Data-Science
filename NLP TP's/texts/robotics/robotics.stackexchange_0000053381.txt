Q:

What are the steps of having ROS on a custom robot?

hi there,
I'm new to ROS and it was a bit hard for me to start with ROS because I used to program my robots on my own with some languages like C# or C++ and I didn't care about being global and so on.
now I've got a costume robot which has a kinect and some sensors which are connected to some micro-controllers and i can receive their data through Serial-Port.
my question is what are the steps to start with having ROS for my robot?
I mean after I read the tutorials what should I do in general and step by step?
from where should I start?
Regards

The TurtleBot software, tutorials and examples are definitely good sources of information for starters. Since you are mentioning the serial connection, you might also want to look at rosserial.
