Q:

groovy rosserial does not recognize the location of the sketchbook

Ubuntu 12.04
groovy
I have installed the rosserial by using the instructions at
github.com/ros-drivers/roserial and followed the catkin instructions
cd catkin_ws
catkin make
catkin make install
source ~/catkin_ws/install/setup.bash
cd /home/charlie/sketchbook/libraries
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py
everything seems to work OK up to this point, then I get the following statement
"make_libraries.py generates the Arduino rosserial library files. It requires the location of your Arduino sketchbook/libraries folder"
Arduino is installed on the desktop.
Any ideas ?

A:

The command to make the libraries is rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .  The period is need to specify your current directory.
