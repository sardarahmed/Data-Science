Q:

ros publishing without loop?

If I am publishing a "geometry_msgs::Twist" with out a while(n.ok()) loop it is not affecting the topic. But I can not use a infinite loop. Everytime according the scan data I have to modify the linear and angular velocity of the Twist msgs. Is there any way out to affect the topic without using the loop.. Thanks in advance

can you write more about issue , also if possible the code.

A:

There are some possiblities to publish outside the while loop, e. g.
--> publishing in a subcriber callback (suitable if your node dows only few processing and your published out message only depends on the incoming messages, e. g. for any kind of republishers)
--> publishing in a timer callback (if you want to publish at constant rate outside the while (ros::ok()) loop  )
Note that you should set up your publisher before initializing the Subscriber/Timer and your publisher should be visible inside the callback (local publisher object not possible anymore).
