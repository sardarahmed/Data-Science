Q:

How to name a rosserial_arduino node?

How do you give a name to a rosserial_arduino node? There are several good examples, but none of them specify a name, resulting in the published topics and listeners appearing in the root namespace.
Normally, a node's name is specified with ros::init(argc, argv, "some_name"); but it doesn't look like rosserial_arduino supports this.

A:

you can chage the node name with an ros Lauch file
here my code in my Launch file:
<node pkg="rosserial_python" type="serial_node.py" name="serial_stepper_node">
  <param name="port" value="/dev/ttyUSB0"/>
</node>

Apparently, I can also do the same thing with a <group ns="some_name"> tag.
