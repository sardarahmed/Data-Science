Q:

Global path not changing despite newly discovered obstacle

Hi,
I'm using move_base to generate paths based on a map & odom generated by hector_mapping. The below rviz screenshot sums up my problem quite well: essentially as the new (middle) obstacle appeared in my LiDAR's view, the global path (in green) doesn't update. It seems properly inflated (blue).
So what happens is that move_base keeps going onto the global path until it arrives too close to the obstacle, and then it backs up (recovery mode).
Any ideas why my global path isn't changing?

My yamls:
   global_costmap:

  global_frame: /map
  robot_base_frame: /base_link 
  update_frequency: 1.0

  static_map: false
  rolling_window: true

  width: 26
  height: 26
  resolution: 0.025

  map_type: costmap

local_costmap:
  global_frame: /odom
  robot_base_frame: /base_link 
  update_frequency: 1.5
  publish_frequency: 1.5
  static_map: false
  rolling_window: true
  width: 20.0 
  height: 20.0 
  resolution: 0.05

  map_type: costmap

A:

I was able to fix this problem by setting a smaller path_distance_bias for my base_local_planner. Now move_base veers away from this "wrong" global path & creates a new better global path.
path_distance_bias: 0.15 # weighting for how much the controller should stay close to the path it was given
