Q:

Recovery Behaviour Plugin not loading

I am using Husky in Gazebo simulation. Because it is not circular in shape, rotate recovery does not help much. So I am trying to use a plugin.
The Plugin is located in my catkin_ws.
rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core correctly lists the following:
straf_recovery /home/ted/catkin_ws/src/straf_recovery/straf_recovery_plugin.xml
and here is how I have modified the move_base.launch file:
<arg name="recovery_plugin" default="straf_recovery"/>
<node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" respawn="false" name="move_base" output="screen">
<param name="recovery_behaviors" value="$(arg recovery_plugin)"/>
But during runtime i get the error:
The recovery behavior specification must be a list, but is of XmlRpcType 4.

A:

I think you have to add the param as below
  [ { name: "backup_recovery", type: "backup_recovery_dwa/BackupRecovery" } ]
