Q:

eclipse project - catkin run tests?

I built eclipse projects for my modules using catkin_make -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" but it did not create test targets.  It seems that eclipse is set up to just run make this way, and trying to run target test, run_tests, etc. does not work.
Alternatively, is there a way to make catkin_make (and make without arguments in the build directory) build and run the tests by default?

A:

This is not specific to Eclipse. You have to run CMake with the flag -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=1 in order to configure the packages with their tests.
