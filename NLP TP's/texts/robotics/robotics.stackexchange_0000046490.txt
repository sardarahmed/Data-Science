Q:

Wrong header included by compiler

I've asked a question about execution error of a kinematics tutorial. After much discussion with dornhege, we guessed that the problem might be the hearder file being included was wrong.
When I wrote a program which included "kinematics_msgs/GetKinematicSolverInfo.h", it would not link the one in [/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/kinematics_msgs], instead it would link the header in [/opt/ros/fuerte/include/kinematics_msgs].
However, the definition of the header in the latter path is out dated, the correct one is from the former, which is a package you can roscd into. This caused the following problem when I ran the program :
[ERROR] [1354979145.382429702, 11715.590000000]: client wants service /pr2_right_arm_kinematics/get_fk to have md5sum 47de11a2bc125445e74531db0e2d1c21, but it has 2088007c8963e2252a67c872affa0985. Dropping connection.

I've tried another two computers and got the same problem, but this didn't happen on dornhege's computer. How to solve this problem? Thanks

A:

It seems like you have installed the packages ros-fuerte-arm-navigation and ros-fuerte-moveit-msgs on your computer. The former provides the version in /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation while the latter provides /opt/ros/fuerte/include/kinematics_msgs.
I would consider this as a bug in the ROS packages and to solve it, I guess you will have to remove one of the two packages from your system. Also, consider filing it at the moveit bug tracker.

I've removed the ros-fuerte-moveit-msgs package and everything got fine ! Thanks. I would like to ask one more question. Instead of removing ros-fuerte-moveit-msgs, can I tell my package to include the correct header from /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/arm_navigation/kinematics_msgs?

I think it's a bug in the dependencies of the arm_kinematics package and should be fixed there. I think filing a ticket is the right thing to do here.
