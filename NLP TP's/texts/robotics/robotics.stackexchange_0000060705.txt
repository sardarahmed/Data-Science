Q:

costmap_2d python interface?

Does it exist?  Or is there a way to have a running costmap_2d instance, but interact with it primarily through standard ros interfaces so that python could be used on the one end at least?

Follow up answer in the form of an answer, which is legitimate because it also answers my own question sort of.
