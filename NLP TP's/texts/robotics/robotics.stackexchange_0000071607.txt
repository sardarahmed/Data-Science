Q:

Navigation Stack: Invalid argument passed to canTransform argument source_frame in tf2 frame_ids cannot be empty

Hi,
I am trying to get the navigation stack working. I am publishing odometry data, tf data and laser scan to Navigation stack. But I get "Invalid argument passed to canTransform argument source_frame in tf2 frame_ids cannot be empty" error when I initialize Rviz
Navfn ROS topic gives error "For Frame []: Frame [] does not exist". "Transform: [Sender =Unknown Publisher]"I am not able to generate any path to goal for my robot. Any ideas?
I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo

Edited part: More details
Here is the link to the source code: https://github.com/pchatrath/navigation-stack-quadcopter.git
I run the run_all script to get all things running. These are the steps that are undertaken:
1.Run roscore

Run houkuyo_node (frame laser)
Run robot_tf_publisher which is a static transform publisher between base_link and laser
Run  odometry_publisher code. I have written a subscriber which takes data from /cmd_vel topic and publishes it as output of odometry
Run move_base which configures all the costmap params. The link above has details about all the apramers that I configured.
run rviz

Questions that I have are - can i use odom as the global frame. Have I configured the odometry_publisher subscriber correctly?
Thanks
I have edited the code as guided. Path is not generated yet. Link to tf tree pic
rviz
source frame id error

A:

The issue I guess was I wasn't using a static map for global costmap I had to state: static_map:false and rolling window: true. Now the robot navigates to goal position.
