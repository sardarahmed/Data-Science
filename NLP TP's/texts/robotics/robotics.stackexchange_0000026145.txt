Q:

imu not measuring acceleration and angular rates in cmd_vel mode

I am using cmd_vel to command the drc robot in the qual1 world. I want to fuse in IMU data. The /atlas/imu/angular_velocity/z remains small even though the true robot is turning at upto 5 rad/s. Am I missing something ?
Should the IMU not measure the movement ?
regards

By the way I am using drc 2.2. Should I really be using the nightly builds ?

A:

cmd_vel uses the fake teleop which does not use physics, it simply "teleports" the robot, so imu will not work.
