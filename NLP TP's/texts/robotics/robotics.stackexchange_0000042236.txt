Q:

what is adc_timer

In the rosserial_arduino oscilloscope example there is the following line:
long adc_timer;
does anyone know what adc_timer is or how it's being used?
Thanks!

Hi,
I've done this tutorial as well, and I don't see any use for that line in the code. I am certain if you comment it out (go ahead and try) that it will compile just fine.
The best reason I could see for something like this is to put a timestamp on the message, but you don't need a separate variable to keep track of that value, since you can simply use the nodehandle timestamp call : nh.now();
If you're interesting in adding a time stamp, you want to modify your message with a header. I had written up a similar thing on my blog that outputs the oscilloscope/ADC values in volts instead of counts, and includes the time stamp. If you're interested you can check it out here :
