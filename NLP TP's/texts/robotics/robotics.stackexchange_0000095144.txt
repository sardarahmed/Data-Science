Q:

Installing python-rosdep manually is required to follow the official instruction on Ubuntu 18.04?

According to this change (https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep/pull/731), it seems like python-rosdep is not required by ros-melodic-rospack and not installed by just executing apt install ros-melodic-ros-base.
Is it necessary to manually install python-rosdep when installing ROS on a new computer to follow the official instruction?
I wrote a detailed log on this issue (https://github.com/Tiryoh/ros_setup_scripts_ubuntu/issues/1).
If there is a better place to write an issue about this problem, please direct me.

I've also came across this bug because my CI testing for melodic is now failing, the official install instructions are now broken.

A:

rosdep has been an optional package.  Executing apt install python-rosdep is required from now on.
