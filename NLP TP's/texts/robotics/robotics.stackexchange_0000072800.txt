Which ROS-Distro did you install? The title says hydro,  the question jade. You cannot install them on the same system.
Also, if you tried reinstalling it and this file is not there, there has ben a problem with the reinstall. Where there any errors when you did sudo apt-get install ros-<XY>?

Sry, the title should be jage, is not hydro. and im installing indigo.

Then please edit the question.

A:

This error means that your .bashrc still contains the following line
source /opt/ros/jade/setup.bash 

which, according to your question and the comments, you have uninstalled by now.
Simply remove this line in the .bashrc!
Above, you have been talking about reinstall ROS. If you uninstalled ROS Jade and now installed ROS Indigo, this error is obvious. For Indigo, you need to source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash.
