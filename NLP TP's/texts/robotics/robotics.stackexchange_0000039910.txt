Q:

Configuring ROS environment for Fuerte

Hi all,
Can someone tell me how to configure the environment for Fuerte so that I can get my custom packages to run as before?
I am looking for something similar to this:

A:

Use rosinstall. Suppose you want to put your local packages into ~/ros-fuerte/workspace and create an overlay in ~/ros-fuerte:
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install rosinstall

mkdir -p ~/ros-fuerte/workspace
rosinstall ~/ros-fuerte /opt/ros/fuerte ~/ros-fuerte/workspace

This creates a setup.bash and friends in ~/ros-fuerte. Source it and your environment should be set.

Good approach, and it works similarly for Electric workspaces. I like the new rosws script, which is packaged with rosinstall. http://www.ros.org/doc/api/rosinstall/html/rosws.html

Yes. rosws is probably the better choice.
