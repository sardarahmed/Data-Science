Q:

Looking for a convenient way to install Turtlebot from source

Is there an easy way to install the Turtlebot source code and its dependencies, in a similar manner to rosinstall with desktop or desktop-full ?

For fuerte??

A:

udo apt-get install ros-electric-turtlebot
and you have many different packages to install. They'll be added to /opt/ros/electric/stacks
It is obvious that you can change electric for any ros release you want.

Indeed, but I'm not thinking of the binary installer.  It is possible to check out the latest Turtlebot code from the repository, but there are also various unmet dependencies and trying to check out all of those individually is quite arduous.
Comment by apalomer on 2012-06-06:
if you want there's a command to install all the dependencies.
Comment by apalomer on 2012-06-06:
rosdep-install.
What I do is rosmake --rosdep-install in the package and that's all.
Comment by JediHamster on 2012-06-06:
rosdep-install doesn't seem to work in fuerte.  Is it deprecated?

Installation of turtlebot from the source is suggested. Its not too much dependent on the other packages that are not default in the ros. I assume joystick_drivers would be the package were the dependency issue might come.

no idea, I don't use fuerte...
Comment by JediHamster on 2012-06-06:
joystick_drivers is also dependent upon other packages not included by using rosinstall with desktop-full, so I was just wondering whether there was some more convenient way of doing this other than going package hunting.

Even i haven't had hands on fuerte yet. Please update your question "looking for a convenient way" and also mention fuerte as the version of ros being used. I guess pros  will look at it and add something to the tutorials. Hunting is what i did when i installed. Its not that arduous either.
