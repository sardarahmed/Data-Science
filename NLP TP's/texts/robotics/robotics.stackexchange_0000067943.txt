Q:

RQT_Graph cmd_vel passthrough

Hi All,!
I am troubleshooting a robot I am working on and for some reason the twist commands are not getting to the base. On ething I found that I think is out of the ordinary is this: 
Is it normal that /cmd_vel is:

Coming from two different sources into the rostopic node?
Going through the Arduino node?
And that it has that little loop above the /arduino bubble in the arduino node?

Thanks for all your help in advance,
luketheduke

A:

That diagram you poseted looks like a valid ROS node graph architecture-wise; ROS topic is n-to-n, not 1-to-1. See other threads for example (1, 2) for more concept.
Depending on your application, however, your configration can be problematic since all topics are published under the same name cmd_vel. You could publish the same topic type (called msg in ROS) under different names so that the subscribers can differentiate what they really need.
