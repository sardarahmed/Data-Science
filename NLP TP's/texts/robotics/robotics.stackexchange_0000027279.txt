Q:

SetForce with ODE Engine: error in documentation?

Hi,
I've written a ModelPlugin which calls physics::Joint::SetForce(int, double) on a revolute joint using the ODE physics engine. According to the documentation Gazebo API doc this should only work for SimBody and DART engine (I'm using gazebo 4.1).
However, it works as expected.
My question is: can I safely use this with ODE, i.e. it's only an error in the documentation, or do I have to expect this behaviour will break in some update?

A:

The SetForce method is implemented for all the physics engines, check for example the ODE implementation and the Bullet implementation.
However a known issue is that the SetForce documentation is incomplete, see the related issue in the Gazebo Bug-tracker: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issue/878/joint-setforce-documentation-incomplete . If you plan to use this function, I suggest you vote for this issue.
