Q:

What is the standard you can be called good at ROS?

I worked on ROS for 3 months now, and I'm using other people's package to do my project, but I feel like I can only use, not make my own package, is it ok? what does it mean to be a ROS developer?

A:

Have a look at this discussion.
Dependent on your needs, developing a solution to your task might involve:

Purely using existing packages, or
Changing code of existing packages, or
Writing new packages, or
Submitting patches to the ROS core libraries.

Those are all different levels of 'being a developer'.
So what's in a name... The question is rather: do you succeed in solving the tasks that you want to solve. If yes: great! If no: keep on learning. You will get there, but it's a very steep learning curve.
