Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS offline

Is there any way to run a ROS "network" offline? For example, on a computer without an internet connection how can one start a roscore and other nodes that only communicate with each other on that machine?

A:

Yes, just set your ROS_MASTER_URI to localhost (which I believe is the default).

This occurs in kinetic and melodic as well. added ROS_MASTER_URI to localhost and it solved it.
