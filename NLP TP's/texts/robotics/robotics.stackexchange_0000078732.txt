Q:

Error while trying to create workspace with catkin_make

I'm new in ROS and i have a problem with workspace creation. I follow this tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace. After catkin_make command i got errors:
ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.package import parse_package" failed: No module named catkin_pkg.package
Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

CMake Error at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/safe_execute_process.cmake:11 (message):

A:

From this bit:
execute_process(/home/vovanrew/anaconda2/bin/python

it would seem you have Anaconda installed and Catkin (and possibly the rest of ROS) is using that as the default interpreter.
But the catkin_pkg package has probably only been installed for the 'regular' Python interpreter (ie: the one that was installed by your Linux distribution).
There are numerous posts on ROS Answers about setting up Anaconda such that it can be used with ROS (although I mostly remember posts showing that it doesn't work). I suggest you search a bit and use one of the provided solutions.
