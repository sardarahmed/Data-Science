Q:

Unable to Load Map on STDR GUI

I've followed all the instructions on the stdr tutorials but I am unable to load my map. When I execute rosrun stdr_gui stdr_gui_node I get it to run, but when I click load map the screen freezes and the node becomes unresponsive. Here's the terminal output I'm getting:
[ WARN] [1507043350.785077446]: Trying to register to /stdr_server/load_static_map_external... 
[ INFO] [1507043350.785899095]: waitForService: Service [/stdr_server/load_static_map_external] has not been advertised, waiting...

When I try to run stdr_gui via roslaunch, the "waitForService" prompt on the terminal doesn't appear, but the gui still freezes.
Anyone know what might be the issue?

Can you please copy/paste the errors directly from the terminal to here instead of linking to a screen shot? This will help to make the question self-contained.

I tried to put add the image using the link but it doesn't work. (also sorry I don't have any points because this is my first post)

No worries. What I meant though is to literally copy and paste the text directly from the terminal and post it here as opposed to taking a screenshot and posting an image. Text is king for this because it can be copy/pasted and searched.

Thanks for the advice, here's the prompt regarding what issue I'm getting: [ WARN] [1507043350.785077446]: Trying to register to /stdr_server/load_static_map_external... [ INFO] [1507043350.785899095]: waitForService: Service [/stdr_server/load_static_map_external] has not been advertised, waiting..

A:

Your stdr_gui_node is waiting for the stdr server. Launch the server with the following:
$ roslaunch stdr_launchers server_no_map.launch

strd_gui node is only a GUI. Server does all the heavy lifting and the GUI is not functional without it.
