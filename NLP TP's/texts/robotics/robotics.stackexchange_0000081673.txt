Q:

Modifying gazebo_ros_pkgs to build a custom version of Gazebo

Hei guys,
I am not sure where to modify  gazebo_ros_pkgs in order to have my modified version of Gazebo built.
As far as I got I see that there is a file  gazebo_ros_pkgs/gazebo_dev/cmake/gazebo_dev-extras.cmake that uses some environment variables in order to add the source files.
# The following lines will tell catkin to add the Gazebo directories and libraries to the
# respective catkin_* cmake variables.
set(gazebo_dev_INCLUDE_DIRS ${GAZEBO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
set(gazebo_dev_LIBRARY_DIRS ${GAZEBO_LIBRARY_DIRS})
set(gazebo_dev_LIBRARIES ${GAZEBO_LIBRARIES})

Is that it? If so do I just need to set those up, dowload gazebo_ros_pkgs and then build the workspace?
Tnx

A:

I managed to use a second version of Gazebo that I manually installed following the instructions and then adding the path to the installed library to the  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. The added path was /usr/local/lib like so: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lical/lib from my .bashrc file or locally in the console. If there are any problems download also gazebo_ros_pkgs and compile it from a workspace. That seems to fix my problems.
