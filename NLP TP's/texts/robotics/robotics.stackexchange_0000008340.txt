Q:

Trying to calculate the Thrust of my quadcopter motors

I am trying to Calculate the thrust my 4 quadcopter motors will have.
I am not sure how to do it. Here are the parts I am Using
4S 6600mAh 14.8V Lipo Pack 
15x5.5 Prop
274KV motor max output is 28A
ESC 35 Amp
Thank You

A:

Thrust is a force. You probably have a device in your house to measure force: a scale, so why not determine the thrust empirically?

Build a little mount to place the prop on a scale securely.
Tare the scale
start the motor, the reading of the scale will tell you how much thrust the prop produces

A:

Your motors do not develop the thrust, they spin rotors which develop thrust. Practically speaking, it is probably better to create an empirical model (or look-up table) based on measurements of the thrust versus motor voltage -- see Bending Unit 22's answer.
However, if you really want to predict the thrust, you'll need a model of your rotor. Then you can use blade element momentum theory (BEMT) to estimate the thrust based on the rotor properties -- chord distribution, twist distribution, airfoil lift and drag profiles, etc.
You can also reduce the model to a simple equation like this:
$T = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2} K_T \rho D^4 \omega^2$
Where $T$ is the thrust, $\rho$ is the air density, $D$ is the diameter of your rotor, $\omega$ is the rotor angular speed, and $K_T$ is the thrust coefficient defined as a function of the advance ratio, $\zeta$.
$K_T = C_{T1} \zeta + C_{T2}$
$\zeta = \frac{2 \pi \left( v - v_{\infty} \right)}{\omega D}$
The coefficients $C_{T1}$ and $C_{T2}$ are specific to the rotor blade, and $\zeta$ is a function of the relative vehicle speed along the thrust direction with respect to the surrounding air ($v - v_{\infty}$).
Note that this simplified model is typically more applicable to underwater propellers, but might work for your quadrotor as well. However, BEMT is the usual approach for modeling rotorcraft thrust.
But to apply any model you will need to know the properties of your rotor, and they can be difficult to find (especially considering the properties are probably not constant along the blade). This is why an empirical method is likely your best option to avoid unnecessary work.
