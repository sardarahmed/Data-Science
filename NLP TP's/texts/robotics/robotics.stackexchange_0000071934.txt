Q:

PCL removing outliers using radius as condition

Hi I'm using a radius filter to remove outliers from my pointcloud, however the code hangs while creating the filtering object. The code never gotten to the point of outputting the message "cloud after filtering".

std::cerr << "Cloud before statistical filtering: " << std::endl;
std::cerr << *PCL1_temp_cloud << std::endl;
// Create the filtering object
pcl::RadiusOutlierRemovalpcl::PointXYZ outrem;
outrem.setInputCloud(PCL1_temp_cloud);
outrem.setRadiusSearch(0.8);
outrem.setMinNeighborsInRadius (2);
outrem.filter (*PCL1_cloud_filtered);
std::cerr << "Cloud after filtering: " << std::endl;   // code stops before this point
std::cerr << *PCL1_cloud_filtered << std::endl;
pcl::toROSMsg    (*PCL1_cloud_filtered, output);

A:

Is this line intended?
 sor.filter (PCL1_cloud_filtered);

It is possibly for statistical outlier removal. If it is not related, you can try removing it.

Mistake when pasting the code. Statistical outlier removal works for me. But it doesn't fully remove all the noise.

Did you try debugging with something like gdb? Do you have any console output?

I used rviz to note that the pointcloud was present prior to filtering. It output the cloud details before filtering, but after that it hangs.
