Q:

Navigation stack in a busy room

Has anyone had any experience running the navigation stack in a room with alot of dynamic obstacles (aka people in a crowded shop)? I'm looking for advice more in terms of its ability to localise rather than any concerns due to obstacle avoidance/path planning.
We'll probably do some testing very shortly, but I thought it would be good to know where to concentrate our efforts in advance if others have had similar experiences.

Hey Daniel, could you share what you did to sort this situation out. I am trying to implement something similar and wondering what to use. New with ROS :)

A:

In that type of environment you probably want the laser scanner or Kinect to be above head height, or pointing towards the ceiling.  The SEEGRID robots have a similar issue with dynamic environments, and if you check their videos you can see that the cameras are pointing upwards.  Even in very dynamic environments, things at higher elevations don't tend to change much from day to day.
If you're using a Kinect you could have it pointing forwards, in which case you can still use it for detecting and avoiding obstacles, but then create a fake laser scan maybe a couple of meters above ground level which can be fed into the navigation.
