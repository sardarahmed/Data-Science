Q:

Is there a way to read .pbstream file?

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. I need to read .pbstream file. I need to achieve result like this. I already tried to use script from this repository and I have this error and steel couldn't resolved it:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 5, in <module>
    from pbstream.reader import PBstream_Reader
  File "<frozen zipimport>", line 259, in load_module
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pbstream-0.0.1-py3.8.egg/pbstream/reader.py", line 9, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cartographer.mapping'

Is there any package that solves this task or maybe is there any suggestion how to solve this No module named 'cartographer.mapping' problem. Appreciate any help
