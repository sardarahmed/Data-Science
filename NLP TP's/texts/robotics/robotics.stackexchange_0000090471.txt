Q:

Obstacle detection using turtlebot w/kinect

Hello, I'm new to ROS and not very familiar with it. I am currently following tutorials and currently able to make the turtlebot2 move forward with a script but now I want to detect an obstacle with the kinect and stop. Not too sure how I would go about doing this, any suggestions?

A:

Start with the moveit tutorials.
Then get a bit familiar with moveit, especially follow the Moveit Setup Assistant, Moveit Perception Pipeline Tutorial.
Find a good and simple .urdf for the kinect and then set it up according to this video here. Then you can follow the planning scene tutorial to setup a collision checking node.
It will be a bit hard at first, but keep trying. You will get it.
There probably is another way to do this, I am not totally sure, but watch this too, it might help you.
Good luck!
