Q:

setting marker for given period time fails

I am trying to visualize a specific marker for few period of time, but when i try this code it shows error:
 error: no match for ‘operator=’ (operand types are ‘visualization_msgs::Marker_<std::allocator<void> >::_lifetime_type {aka ros::Duration}’ and ‘int’)
     points.scale.y = 0.01; points.lifetime=1;

My codes are:
 visualization_msgs::Marker points, line_strip, line_list;
     points.header.frame_id = line_strip.header.frame_id = line_list.header.frame_id = "/camera_depth_frame";    points.header.stamp = line_strip.header.stamp = line_list.header.stamp = ros::Time::now();
        points.ns = line_strip.ns = line_list.ns = "lines";
    points.action =line_strip.action = line_list.action = visualization_msgs::Marker::ADD;
    points.pose.orientation.w = line_strip.pose.orientation.w = line_list.pose.orientation.w = 1.0;
    points.id = 0;
    line_strip.id = 1;
    line_list.id = 2;
    points.type = visualization_msgs::Marker::POINTS;
    line_strip.type = visualization_msgs::Marker::LINE_STRIP;

line_list.type = visualization_msgs::Marker::LINE_LIST;
points.scale.x = 0.01; 
points.scale.y = 0.01; points.lifetime=1;

How can i use this lifetime parameter? For eg. here i was trying to set lifetime of points as 1 sec.

A:

Read the error message. You cannot set (that is, use the = operator) the field points.lifetime (which is an object of type ros::Duration) to an int.
You can, however, set points.lifetime to ros::Duration(1.0).

i have did that also points.lifetime=ros::Duration(0.5) but the points were staying for more than 0.5 sec so. But i'll try it again, re test.

ok it looks like it works, but the previous points are again appearing after being replaced by another point.
