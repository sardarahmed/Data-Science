Q:

Turtlebot android applications - Fuerte

Hi all.
I installed ROS Fuerte on turtlebot's laptop and apps of Willow garage on my tablet.
I can use and save the map in "Make a Map" application.
When I am trying to run "Map Nav" application the map selection server cannot find a map. I have another turtlebot with ROS electric and I can run all android application very well.
Please help me to solve this problem.

A:

With my robot, I had the problem that some launch files were not correct in fuerte.
turtlebot_teleop/app/android_*.launch
For aquiring the map, I had to install ros-fuerte-map-store too. For navigating the map I changed the node type in android_map_nav.launch from map_loader to map_manager
-  <node pkg="map_store" type="map_loader" name="map_manager" output="screen"/>
+  <node pkg="map_store" type="map_manager" name="map_manager" output="screen"/>
