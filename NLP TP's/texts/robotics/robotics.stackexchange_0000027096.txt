Q:

Passive Joint Problem

Dear all,
I want to simulate the passive joint(sping-damper) using in my model. But what i found in the joint setting is just <damping> tag, without stiffness tag as expected.
Any suggest to that idea?
Thank so much!
Here my joint:
<joint type='revolute' name='Joint'>
 <pose>0 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0</pose>
 <child>LowerSg</child>
 <parent>UpperSg</parent>
 <axis>
  <xyz>0 1 0</xyz>
      <dynamics>
       <damping>0.0000</damping>
       <friction>0.0000</friction>
      </dynamics>
 </axis>
</joint>

A:

We added spring stiffness tags to gazebo 3.1 in pull request 1117. See the changes to the spring_damper_test.world for an example of the syntax.
