Please add more information: Linux distribution, version of distribution, ROS version, installed from source or binaries?

A:

The problem is solved:
in Moveit official website is written:
Note for Ubuntu 13.4 32 bit users: There is a bug with GCC 4.7 on Ubuntu 13.4 32bit with Eigen 3.1.2. Itâ€™s not likely to be fixed, so upgrade/downgrade your system to 13.4 64 bit resp. 12.4.
So don't use 32 bit distributions.

the note you copied should apply only to ubuntu 13.04 users, which you seem not to be. I'm running a 12.04 32bit installation with MoveIt (from source and installed using apt-get) and don't experience any issues.

I though that there is an issue with 32 bit either for Ubuntu 13 or 12, I don't know why you don't have the same problem. Now I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit and it woks fine
