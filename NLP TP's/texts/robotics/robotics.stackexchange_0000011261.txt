Q:

Cheapest GPS that is accurate to ca. 30cm in woodland

As part of my PhD field work it would be useful to have latitude/longitude measurements for the locations of ant nests that I am working on. These ant nests can be as close as 50cm together so the accuracy of the system would (I think) need to be higher than is available from a phone or basic GPS system. Does anyone know what system would be best for getting this sort of accuracy? My budget is probably only around Â£200. If it isn't possible in that price range it would be good to know what system I would need to use so that I can see if I can just borrow such a system.
Thanks a lot!

I suggest you are going to look into Chen at al 2015
"Computationally efficient carrier integer ambiguity resolution in multiepoch gps/ins: a common-position-shift approach"
This is a very good paper, which allows location down to a centimeter level.
Anyway this approach is not plug and play, I fear you have to implement it on your own.
I'm not aware of any open source implementation so far.
More over if you are trying to locate the ants within a forest, then gps is a not the best approach. Gps uses some wavelengths which are absorbed easily by water and well the trees do contain at lot of water. Long story told short: gps in the forest will never be as accurate as you need.
I know this is not the answer you expected, hope it can help a bit
