A:

Use following lines to get the pointer to the other model.
physics::WorldPtr world_ptr = model_ptr->GetWorld();

physics::ModelPtr other_model_ptr = world_ptr->ModelByName("other_model_name") 

Now you can work with the other model the same way as with the model to which the plugin is attached.
