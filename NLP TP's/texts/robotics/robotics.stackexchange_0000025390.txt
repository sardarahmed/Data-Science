Q:

Is it possible to run gzserver and gzclient on separate computers?

Is it possible to run gzserver on one computer while the gzclient on another one? I tried to change the GAZEBO_MASTER_URI on another computer to the IP address that the gazebo runs,  and then start the gzclient. The messages printed out show that it connects to the gazebo master but shows only an empty world on GUI.

You now have > 16 karma, and thus voting rights. Use them wisely : )

A:

Yes. See here.
You just need to make sure that the network settings permit both machines to resolve the network names (or IP addresses) used.  Gazebo seems to borrow alot from the ROS NetworkSetup, so that's a good read as well.
Also, did you set GAZEBO_MASTER_URI? You mentioned GAZEBOMASTERURI.
Finally, did the world that you used successfully spawn/load all the desired objects?

I'd be cautious of trying to do this over the internet though.. I haven't tried it (yet), but I would expect the network traffic to induce latency.
