Q:

Getting vslam_tutorial.bag working on Fuerte

The "vslam_tutorial.bag" provided in this tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/vslam_system/Tutorials/RunningVslamOnStereoData) is in Cturtle format. There is a fix suggested (migrating the bag forward) but it doesn't seem to fix it for Fuerte (my version of ROS). Could anyone provide a .bag file I can use in VSLAM running in Fuerte? Or is there a way of migrating the .bag file forward such that it is compatible with Fuerte?
Here is the error message:
yglee@yglee-VirtualBox:~/ros_workspace/VSLAMDIR/vslam_system$ rosbag play --clock ../vslam_tutorial.bag

Thank you!

HI Willow Garage, Could one of you ( VSLAM team) please provide example .bag files for the vslam on Fuerte? Thanks.

Note the giant red warning box on the VSLAM wikipage; this software is no longer supported in any form. (For example, there hasn't been anything like a "vslam team" in several years).

Ah I see. Then to the general audience: did anyone get VSLAM working on Fuerte? If so, is there an example data file (.bag) you can share?

A:

The CameraInfo message changed a while back. You can run rosbag fix to upgrade the message to the current version. I have used it before to convert old bag files to Diamondback and Electric.

It doesn't work for Fuerte but thanks for the suggestion (let me know if you got it working for Fuerte).
