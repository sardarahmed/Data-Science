Spinning disk Weapon

I am building a Hobby-weight robot and my weapon of choice is a spinning disk at the front.
As regards the disk I was thinking of buying commercial (grinder-type) disks and change type of disk depending on the "enemy's" chassis construction material. So for instance I would have an aluminum cutting disk if the enemy's chassis is made of aluminum and so on.
First question is therefore; do such disks do the job in practise (or break, fail to cut?)
Secondly, should I use a brushed or brush-less motor for the disk? I actually have ESCs for both but sort of feel a brushed motor will give me more torque while a brush-less motor might give me more speed. So which is more important speed or torque? 
I do know - from my uncle who uses metal lathes - that machines that cut metal usually spin at a slower speed (drills, cutting wheels etc)- indeed he likes to say that metal working machines are safer than wood-working ones partially for this reason. 
But I am a newbie and really would like to have an effective weapon if possible and breaking or not-cutting disks do not make such a weapon!
Also is it normal practise to use one battery for everything (drive and weapon) or have two separate batteries?

A:

Well grinding machines in general use really high cutting speeds, so a very high revolution speed.
At a metal lathe it is pretty easy to get the force of your tool onto the workpiece. In a robo-fight it's actually not that easy, so i suggest very high speed.
More like an angle grinder
