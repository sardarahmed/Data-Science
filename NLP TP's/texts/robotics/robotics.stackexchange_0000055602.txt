Q:

occupancy_grid_utils with ros hydro

Hi,
I am trying to use occupancy_grid_utils/ray_tracer.h library in my ros program for localization.But i get an error due to occupancy_grid_utils/ray_tracer.h library does not exist in ros hydro.I got these errors;
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72 (find_package):Could not find a package configuration file provided by occupancy_grid_utils with any of the following names:

occupancy_grid_utilsConfig.cmake
occupancy_grid_utils-config.cmake 

Add the installation prefix of "occupancy_grid_utils" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
or set "occupancy_grid_utils_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
above files.  If "occupancy_grid_utils" provides a separate development
package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
particle_filter/CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package)`
Is there any way to use this library in ros hydro?
Thanks.

Hey i am trying to use the same repo to use the grid_construction_node to visualize the occupancy grid with a Hokuyo  mounted on a husky but I get the error stating no map received. Did you manage to make it work? Could you help me with this ?
