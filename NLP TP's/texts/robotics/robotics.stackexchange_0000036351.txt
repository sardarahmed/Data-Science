Q:

Is there a C++ API for a dynamic reconfigure client?

Is there a C++ API that I can use from within a C++ node that will create a dynamic reconfigure client? I would like my node to be able to modify some of the base_local_planner parameters, such as the min/max velocities, during run time.
I have looked at the dynamic_reconfigure wiki and the client API pages and I only see a way to use a Python client node to update variables on a dynamic reconfigure server.

Just came across the same problem. The use a dynamic_reconfigure server in TrajectoryPlannerROS, but according to the wiki there still is no C++ api. Or has anyone found out if there is a (hidden) C++ api that can make a client?

fivef's answer is great! Just as a follow up, someone was inspired by fivef's answer and posted a more detailed example here

A:

Looks like someone added a C++ API in June 2016. I'm not sure how to use it or how it compares in performance to the python Client, but you can see the commit details here https://github.com/ros/dynamic_reconfigure/pull/63.

I made this as the selected answer as this refers to the official api for Kinetic onward.
