Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: URDF and SDF?

Hi All,
I've seen a bit of discussion about URDF and SDF here and I thought I'd ask the broad question before I try to learn either of them.
I am developing a natural language processor to split these out (and into simulations) and I should be aware of which one is better for which purpose (scene vs. robot, if that makes sense, even) or if one is being deprecated or something.
Should I be learning one or the other or both?
I'm all ears.
Sincerely,
-Todd

A:

While this document on Gazebo's web site should answer to the most/all of your questions, I would still comment to:

which one is better for which purpose (scene vs. robot, if that makes sense, even)

URDF is only capable of describing a single robot (i.e. no scene, no multiple robots).

or if one is being deprecated or something.

One of the core Gazebo developers said in 2014 that neither of them is deprecated, which I think is still valid as of today.

Should I be learning one or the other or both?

Though depending on your purpose, I think so in general. With a lack of SDF to URDF conversion yet, ROS tools requires robot description to be done in URDF.
