Q:

Where to find existing "track" in release repository?

While trying to push an existing metapackage to an existing release repository by running bloom-release (tutorial), I get an error:
$ bloom-release --ros-distro groovy qt_gui_core groovy
Given track 'groovy' does not exist in release repository.
Available tracks: ['convert', 'hydro']

But browsing the corresponding git organization on ros-gbp, I find groovy related branches and tags, while I can't find convert thing.
Where are tracks stored?

A:

Tracks are stored on the bloom branch in the tracks.yaml file:
https://github.com/ros-gbp/qt_gui_core-release/blob/master/tracks.yaml
It was released into groovy with an older version of bloom, you can create a new groovy track before releasing if you want:
bloom-release --rosdistro groovy --track groovy qt_gui_core --edit

EDIT Now the tracks.yaml files are stored on the master branch, hopefully that is more discoverable. Note that they will only be on the master branch once release with a newer version of bloom so some repositories may still have their track files stored in the bloom branch. I also updated the command to reflect the new syntax.
