Q:

diagram tool for the design of ros2 packages

Hi,
I need to develop some ROS2 packages for my robot. Before writing each package, I want to draw a diagram for the package relations (e.g. the message, the class calling between them), like a class diagram?
Is there a name for this diagram and is there any tool for this?
The final diagram may look like rqt_graph. But it is designed before every package is prepared.
There seems to be a "package diagram" in starUML. But I'm not sure whether this "package diagram" satisfies .
Thanks for any help!

A:

Hello,
I am using draw.io, it is free. It provides all the basic structure you required for creating graphs, class, and functions.
