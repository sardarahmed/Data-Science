Q:

Jetson TX2 vs small form factor PC for autonomous robots

What are the advantages and disadvantages for each?
I can build a small form factor PC with a GTX 1050 which will easily out perform a jetson for the same price.
When and where are each more appropriate to use? What are the advantages of each?

A:

A Jetson TX2 is about 15 Watts at full load and can run from 9v-15v.
The PC with GTX 1050 will be above 300 Watts and likely require both 5v and 12v supplies with little wiggle room in those numbers.
A mobile robot would need to be quite big to carry the batteries for the PC+GPU This would also be larger in physical size.
The Jetson TX2 is smaller, lighter and with the lower power requirements can have a smaller battery.
