Q:

Unable to locate package libsfml-audio1.5

When "rosmake impromptu_buttons --rosdep-install", error msg:
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['impromptu_buttons'] to:
['impromptu_buttons']                        
[ rosmake ] Generating Install Script using rosdep then executing. This may take a minute, you will be prompted for permissions. . .
rosdep executing this script:
{{{
set -o errexit
#Packages
sudo apt-get install libsfml-audio1.5
}}}
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
[ rosmake ] rosdep install failed: rosdep script failed with stderr 
{{{
E: Unable to locate package libsfml-audio1.5
E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'libsfml-audio1.5'

}}}

Looks like libsfml no longer supports Ubuntu10.10...... anyone run into this problem?

@mjcarroll see the FAQ you're almost there.  (I lowered it for now ;-) )

Thanks @tfoote for the reformat.  When do I get the power to do that? :p

A:

It's because libsfml-audio has been updated to 1.6 in Ubuntu 10.10
sudo apt-get install libsfml-audio1.6 

Should install it for you.
You should also be able to update the https://svn.csail.mit.edu/mit-ros-pkg/trunk/kinect_utils/rosdep.yaml files to reflect this version change.
