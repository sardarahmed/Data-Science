Q:

SimpleAction Error Message

Hello!
I got this message: BUG: Got a transition to CommState [PENDING] when our in SimpleGoalState [ACTIVE]
This seems to be printed in the simple_action_client.h when the client receives a state different that what it expects. How is this possible? What did I do wrong?
Thanks

Also remember to mention what version of the common stack you're using.  There were some bugfixes to the client state matchine in 1.4.4.

Can you provide a small sample program that reproduces this problem? This will help us with debugging.
