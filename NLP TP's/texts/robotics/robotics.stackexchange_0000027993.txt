How to use sdf element in gazebo 7.4

I want to use the sdf class inside my program but it seems like in gazebo 7.4 class sdf is not present as i saw here, I looked at older version gazebo api also and i could clearly see this class in them like here. So how can i use the sdf class in gazebo 7.4.

A:

SDFormat was moved into an independent library (since Gazebo 1.9, I think) .
You can see the API documentation here:
http://sdformat.org/api
You can still use it in your Gazebo plugins and stand-alone programs, adding this header:
#include <sdf/sdf.hh>
