Q:

ros rviz pointcloud point selection

Hi,
This page on rviz display types http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/PointCloud on the ros website mentions a attribute that the pointcloud type is "selectable". I'm not sure what that means exactly but it sounds like something I want.
I would like to display a pointcloud, and qualitatively analyse it. During this, I would like to select a point or a group of points through mouseclicks and do simple analysis like get the point coordinates or compute the group centroid etc.
Does rviz allow you to do that?
Thank you.

A:

AFAIK, Rviz is mainly for visualization. What you want to do (select a point/group of points through mouseclicks, etc) should be done using PCL library or your private methods. Then you publish your results in Rviz for display.

Hmm. Do you know if I could get back stuff like the mouseclick locations, viewpoints, projections from rviz? Then I could go ahead and use that for my methods.

I did a quick search and this #q69019 turned up :) It seems like you can select a point and its position will be printed out.
