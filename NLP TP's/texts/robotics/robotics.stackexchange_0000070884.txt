Q:

Depth sensing camera recommendation?

For getting started with depth sensing in ROS-Industrial I want to purchase a depth sensing camera which is supported in ROS.
I am searching a depth + RGB camera. Therefore the Xtion (only depth) is not a solution. The Xtion Live is not available (at least in EU/ Austria).
Therefore the only solution seems to be the Kinect 1? Unfortunately it is very old and I need a adapter + power supply for connecting it to USB.
Is there any tip for a technically better camera?
Thanks
RockOn

A:

There are multiple RGBD cameras supported by as many ROS drivers/nodes (see wiki.ros.org/Sensors - 3D Sensors for an incomplete listing), but the Kinect v2 is a popular one. Well supported by code-iai/iai_kinect2 and ethz-asl/kinect2-ros.

thx. I also think that the kinect 2 seems to be the best available depth + RGB camera at the moment

Well, that will depend on what your metrics are, I think. There are many rgbd (like) devices that have better accuracy / robustness, but also higher cost fi. I just know that there have been some successful applications in ROS-Industrial using Kinect2's, which is why I mentioned it.
