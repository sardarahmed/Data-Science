Q:

hokuyo_node, where to install with Groovy?

I'm working to get the hokuyo_node running on an embedded system (arm based BeagleBone). The ROS distribution on the Beagle is Groovy but the Hokuyo_node tutorial references Fuerte (http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Tutorials/UsingTheHokuyoNode).
I know the laser_driver was installed under opt/ros/fuerte/stacks in ROS Fuerte but the install locations for ROS are different in Groovy. Should the hokuyo_node go in the ros_ws, the ros_catkin_ws, or somewhere else?
Also, can just the hokuyo_node be installed and not the full laser_driver package or would this require some editing of the pathways somewhere in the hokuyo_node?

A:

You can probably install the Fuerte version in the corresponding Groovy location: /opt/ros/groovy/stacks.
It is generally safer to install all of a stack, in case there are inter-dependencies. If you are short of space, you can experiment with individual packages.

In the Groovy install there is no /opt/ros/groovy/stacks directory. Everything is in the Home directory in either ros_catkin_ws or ros_ws. Should the laser_driver stack go into one of these (maybe with some edits for pathways in the ??? files) to fit with the new ROS build environment?

That's probably because all the packages you installed so far were converted to catkin, which no longer uses the stacks/ directory. Just create it and put the hokuyu_node there.

Maybe I misunderstood your original question, which seemed to imply you were installing to /opt/ros. If you are using source workspaces, just put hokuyu_node in the rosbuild workspace, not catkin.

Thanks for all the help. I found the install process at http://ros.org/wiki/catkin/Tutorials/using_rosbuild_with_catkin and got the laser_driver stack installed in the rosbuild workspace.
