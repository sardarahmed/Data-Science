Q:

Error trying to "catkin_make" ar_pose package

Hello everyone,
I need to read some tags using the kinect. However, even after I installed the dependencies and built the package (commands rosdep install ar_pose -i and rosmake ar_pose), when I try to launch the test:
roslaunch ar_pose ar_pose_single.launch

I receive the following error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ar_pose/ar_single]: can't locate node [ar_single] in package [ar_pose]

I cloned the package from ar_tools and built in my catkin workspace.
Can anyone help me? I'm working with ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.
EDIT1:
Dan, thanks again for your help. I already tried that with no success, I still get the same error when I try to catkin_make. I even erased my build and devel folders to build up my workspace again.
EDIT2:
Dan,
Thanks for your answer. However, I'm still experiencing a problem. When I try to catkin_make install I receive the following error:
Do you know what could be the problem?

EDIT 3:
I tryed what Dan said but I already had libopencv-dev installed in my computer. Therefore, I'm still with the same problem. However, I never used Opencv before so I don't really know if I have to have anything else installed. Do I need to install it from here.
EDIT 4:
I think I got it right now after building vision_opencv in the catkin_workspace. Opencv was missing in my computer even though I had it in the share folder. It now compiles with no errors. Thanks for all the help Dan and Procópio.

A:

ar_tools do work under indigo. checking your error it seems you don't have opencv installed. is that the case?

Indeed. I would have expected some of the other upstream dependencies to pull in opencv, but maybe not. @Leandro, can you try adding <build_depend>libopencv-dev</build_depend> to ar_pose's package.xml, rerun rosdep install and try catkin_make again?
