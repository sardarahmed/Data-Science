Q:

build_depend vs build_export_depend vs exec_depend in ROS with Python?

In the context of using ROS with Python, how would the build_depend, build_export_depend and exec_depend differ?
Since Python is an interpreted language, can I understand it as they should all be the same? How would there be a build process (perhaps excluding the case when we use Cython or other C++ based Python extensions).
Thanks!

A:

You are correct, that there is no build process per se with python-only packages. Note though, that you still need the CMakeLists.txt for catkin to function properly.
In the end, the build_depend and build_export_depend tags are practically irrelevant for python-only packages. You only need to specify your python-based dependencies via exec_depend.
The catkin docs state, however, to import any message packages using the depend tag, even though exec_depend would be enough. Though I'm not sure why that's the case...
