Q:

turtlebot_kinect_arm_calibration not compiling in fuerte

I've been struggling getting the Kinect arm calibration package to compile on Ubuntu 11.10 with Fuerte. I answered my first issue here which might need updating on the Turtlebot repo.
I'm still unable to resolve issues with:
turtlebot_kinect_arm_calibration/src/calibrate_kinect_checkerboard.cpp:317:5: error:
‘estimateRigidTransformationSVD’ is not a member of ‘pcl’
I believe the function ‘estimateRigidTransformationSVD’ is suppose to be in the rigid_transforms.hpp file. I can't find that file anywhere on my computer, but that might be because I am using PCL binaries?
rosmake pcl and rosmake pcl_ros build without failure. I also installed PCL through sudo apt-get install libpcl-all. Not sure what else to try...
Additionally, there is an OpenCV linker issues when the above issue is commented out. I'd love some help in getting this working, thanks!

A:

To followup on this old, unanswered question, I ended up figuring out how to port the code to Fuerte then Groovy, and update the depreciated PCL and OpenCV methods. My work for the ClamArm can be found here:
