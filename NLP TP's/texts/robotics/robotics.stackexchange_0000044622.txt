Q:

simulation for hector slam in ground robot

hello,
I want to run a simulation with hector slam in a ground robot (with laser, odom and imu). I want to use the final gridmap and the estimated robot position.
Anyone knows an alternative to  hector_quadrotor_demo but with a  ground robot?
many thanks,
Filipe
