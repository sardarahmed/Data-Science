Q:

rosdep and ROS2?

Can anyone tell me the status of rosdep with regards to ROS2? I'm a little confused by the ROS2 from-source guide since it actually does use rosdep, but only after installing a ton of dependencies by hand. Contrast that with the same guide for ROS1, which only installs enough to get rosinstall files and merge them into a workspace before using rosdep to get all the dependencies.

A:

The instructions explicitly install dependencies not covered by rosdep keys in ROS packages, e.g. build-essential, cmake, and some tools. That is pretty similar to the ROS 1 instructions in the first section "Installing bootstrap dependencies".
In ROS 2 we additionally need to install a few pip packages just because the available Debian packages are too old.
Anything beyond that is coming in via rosdep - as in ROS 1.
