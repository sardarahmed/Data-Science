Q:

Importing python packages into node files

I have set up my ROS package with the following layout:
packagename
  CMakeLists.txt
  package.xml
  |- src/
    |- packagename/
      |- __init__.py
      |- package_file.py
  |- scripts/
    |- node_file.py

And in node_file.py, I'd like to be able to do
from packagename import package_file

But I get cannot import name package file.
Am I laying this out correctly? How do I make my python package visible to node_file.py? I am using ROS Hydro in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

A:

I didn't realize that I needed a setup.py file at the root of my package (I previously thought this was only needed for installing packages). I was used to using Fuerte where this was unnecessary. See here for how to create and use this file:

Setup.py is very important, and should probably be added to the python publish/subscribe tutorials.
