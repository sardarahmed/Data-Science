A:

Yes there is : camera calibration package.
[EDIT] By the way, it permits to calibrate RGB camera, IR camera. And one camera reguarding the other one. But not the depth.
So if you use multiple kinect, the depth may be a bit shifted from one to the other one.
Ps : Please, in next post, don't forget to precise :

which version of ROS you use
what System you are running it on (ex Ubuntu 10.04)
