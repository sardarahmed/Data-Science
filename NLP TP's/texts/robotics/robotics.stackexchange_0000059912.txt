Q:

catkin_make's option for optimization

I used Eigen library for my program and found that matrix calculation is very slow(Just "for loop" is faster !!).
I think that optimization is not carried out when making the program.
How can I optimize the program ?
Any good catkin option for optimization ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

catkin_make is just a wrapper around CMake, so you can use the standard CMake variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to enable various build options.
For a release configuration with opmizations and no debugging symbols, you can use the Release build type:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

For a release with debug configuration, with optimizations and debug symbols, you can use the RelWithDebInfo build type:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

CMake's useful variables page gives more information about build types.

Could you provide an example of compiling rviz without any optimizations?
Comment by William on 2015-05-04:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-O0 will force it to not have any optimizations, but it should be sufficient to do catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to prevent CMake from introducing optimization flags.
