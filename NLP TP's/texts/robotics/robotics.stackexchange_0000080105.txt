Q:

gazebo ros plugin make error: This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard

Hi,
I'm trying to follow the following tutorial to use gazebo plugins in ROS:
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_plugins
but when I try to compile, I'm getting the following error:
gazebo_tutorials/src/simple_world_plugin.cpp:1:
/usr/include/c++/5/bits/c++0x_warning.h:32:2: error: #error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
 #error This file requires compiler and library support \

and then a bunch of errors... I searched on the internet and I found the following related problem:
https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_create_desktop/issues/18
By the way, I'm using Gazebo 7 with Kinetic.
Best,

This seems like a problem with your compiler. Which compiler are you using, does it support C++11, and do you have C++11 support turned on?

I don't have C++11 support turned on. How I can turn on C++11 support on? I thought ROS is not compatible with C++11. I'm using the default compiler for catkin or how I can check which compiler I'm using?

A:

According to REP-003 ROS Kinetic and newer require C++11 support. catkin uses the system's default compiler, so you should make sure that your default compiler supports C++11.
