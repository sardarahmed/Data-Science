Q:

KDL IKSolver (Only for Destination Orientation)

I want to use KDL for inverse kinematics calculations of 5 axis CNC machines.
5 axis CNC machines has 2 rotational axis and 3 translational axes.
I am going to define kinematics chain in KDL library and i only care about orietation of tool.
The translational axes has no effect for orientation so i can discard them.
Initialy tool orientation vector is 0,0,1.
I want tool vector to get parellel to for example vector 1,0,0.
How can i get joint variables for this situation?

A:

I don't know whether KDL can do IK with less than 6 DoF; I've had good results using OpenRAVE's ikfast module for that (with the TranslationDirection5D plugin type).

I know that at least some of KDLs IK methods do support chains with less than 6 DOF. I've used pydl_utils several times for 2, 3, and 5 DOF manipulators.

I believe the inverse method in pykdl_utils eventually calls KDL's general Newton-Raphson IK solver

Good to know, thanks!
