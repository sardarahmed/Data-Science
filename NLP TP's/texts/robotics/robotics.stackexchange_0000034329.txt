Q:

PyKDL documentation

Is there any way to generate a complete html documentation for PyKDL (the version in python_orocos_kdl package in electric)?
So far I've tried using both rosdoc and pydoc. rosdoc outputs an html with only a couple of references to SIP (same as here), and pydoc.writedoc() does somewhat better, but not much.
I guess that this is due to SIP being used to wrap the C++ code, but the whole API is not available and the only way I've found so far to find out the exact python API is reading the .sip files, which is a bit cumbersome.
Any help would be appreciated.

I just found this http://www.ros.org/doc/api/kdl/html/python/index.html. Not a complete reference either, but definitely better than checking the .sips.

A:

I've added a sphinx builder configuration to the python_orocos_kdl package. It auto-generates the API for all available classes and functions in the PyKDL module. It uses the docstrings that are added by SIP and only include the API syntax, not the documentation from doxygen. But it gives an overview of what is available.
