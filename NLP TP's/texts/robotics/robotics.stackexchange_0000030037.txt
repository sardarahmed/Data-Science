Q:

slam_gmapping MappingFromLoggedData out of dual 32-bit range

Hi,
I followed the tutorial doc.
http://www.ros.org/wiki/slam_gmapping/Tutorials/MappingFromLoggedData
When I finished make index success,and began to play it, I found a error reported.
I have tried both ubuntu 32,64 bits,and it seems the same problem.
The error message is

I use the normal ubuntu 10.10 with Diamondback installation. I didn't find any strange. what I use for installation instruction is "sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-*"

I just tried that tutorial with Diamondback on a 64-bit system, and I couldn't replicate your error.  Is there anything unusual about your system?

I'm having the same issue on 64bit Ubuntu 11.10 with Fuerte.  Any luck solving it?

This question is 6 months old.  At this point it is very unlikely to be answered.  People have already attempted to reproduce your problem and can't, so it's time to let the community to focus on other questions.

Why you want to close this problem? This problem haven't been solved. I'm still waiting for answer.
