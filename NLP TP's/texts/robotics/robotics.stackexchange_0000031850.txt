Q:

vision_bleeding not found

I tried to install "tod_stub", but it failed because it tries to install "vision_bleeding" from a repo which is not found under the specified address. (https://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/branches/trunk_diamondback/stacks/vision_bleeding)
Does anybody know if the repo was moved or deleted or how I could resolve the problem?
thanks

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.pegrevs.html might be an explanation. There's probably the so-called "Peg revision" that is missing.

A:

It's been renamed to vision_future and released into unstable:
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/vision_future/trunk/
Thus, the easiest install path is to:

Switch to ros-unstable instead of ros-diamondback
sudo apt-get install ros-unstable-vision-future
