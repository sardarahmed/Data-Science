Q:

(web) Light weight teleop interface

How can I get the source code for the Turtlebot Android App? I'd like to create a generalized html5 based application for controlling ROS robots via a teleop interface.

The turtlebot android apps are written in Java. There isn't much there that will be portable to html5.

A:

I would suggest that you look at Robot Web Tools for a way to make modern web interfaces.
