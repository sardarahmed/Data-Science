A:

Gazebo is a rigid body simulator that does not support deformable objects. This might change with bullet integration that currently is in the works. This integration will not be backported to electric however, so you'll have to either upgrade or resort to approximations like the one demonstrated in this video. Implementing such approximations likely is non-trivial, however.
