Q:

Twist_controller speedl function error on robot teachpendant

Hello!
I'm currently working on a teleoperation project with an UR robot and I'm trying to use the twist_controller from the ur_robot_driver to control the robot.
But I keep running intro an error whenever I try to run a command such as:
danielh@danielh:~/catkin_ws$ rostopic pub /twist_controller/command geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.01
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0"

The error is as such:
The robot cannot reach the requested pose. Script function speedl is unable to find an inverse kinematics solution.

The real robot is in a pose similar to this one:

How is the function speedl related to this problem and what fix is there for this?
Thanks in advance!

A twist is a linear and angular velocity in a (in this case) Cartesian space.
What is the pose of your robot when you start using the twist controller?
If it's already at or near a maximum I could imagine it can't move linearly in the Y+ direction any more.

It's in a vertical pose, exactly as the one in the image from this post.

A:

Please add that image to this post.
re: your error: that's not going to work.
You're asking the robot to go in a straight line in a direction in which it cannot move any more (due to the pose it's currently in).
Put it in a more neutral pose, with its elbow bent, so the lower arm is parallel to the ground plane.

Alright, so indeed the problem was with the robot's pose. I moved it into a neutral pose and now it works. Thanks for the help!
