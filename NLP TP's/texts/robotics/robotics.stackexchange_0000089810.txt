Q:

std_msgs types and 'normal' type

Hi
I want to display a variable on a topic. Therefore I need to transform my variable from an volatile unsigned long to an std_msgs type (for example UInt64). This gives following error:
no match for 'operator=' (operand types are 'std_msgs::UInt64' and 'volatile long unsigned int')

How can i convert this long to a std_msgs?
Thanks

A:

Your code probably looks like :
std_msgs::UInt64 int_a;
volatile long unsigned int_b;
int_a = int_b;

But if you look at the message definition you'll see that there is a field data, so you have to use it to set the message value :
std_msgs::UInt64 int_a;
volatile long unsigned int int_b;
int_a.data = int_b;
