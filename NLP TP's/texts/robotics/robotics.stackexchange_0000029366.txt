Q:

What is the difference between `--headless-rendering` and the `-s` CLI options?

In Ignition Gazebo Fortress the CLI --help says:
  --headless-rendering         Run rendering in headless mode      
  -s                           Run only the server (headless mode). This        
                               overrides -g, if it is also present.  

What is the difference between --headless-rendering and the -s CLI options?

A:

The -s would still require an X display server if you use rendering sensors (eg. camera). With --headless-rendering, it uses EGL instead. See https://gazebosim.org/api/sim/7/headless_rendering.html
