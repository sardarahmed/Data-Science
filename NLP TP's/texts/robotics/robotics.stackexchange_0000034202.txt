Q:

Initial view after gazebo starts

Hi
I am not happy with the view on my scene after I start gazebo using rosrun with gazebo and my world file.
How can I set the initial view on my scene for the gazebo simulator.
Thanks and Greetings
Max

A:

The world file contains settings for the user camera. Open your world file and search for:
  <rendering:gui>
    <type>fltk</type>
    <size>480 320</size>
    <pos>0 0</pos>
    <frames>
      <row height="100%">
        <camera width="100%">
          <xyz>0.3 0 3</xyz>
          <rpy>0 90 90</rpy>
        </camera>
      </row>
    </frames>
  </rendering:gui>

As you can see, the camera tag contains settings for position and orientation of the camera.

I using Gazebo 9.0 and launching the empty.world. It has only 2 models sun and ground_plane. It does not have any camera settings. How do I configure the camera settings now?

What about switching to orthographic view? Is this possible?
