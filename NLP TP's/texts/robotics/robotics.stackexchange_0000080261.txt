Q:

How to extract image of bebop camera to my computer

I'm trying to processing images obtained of bebop 1 camera from my computer, but I can not access the images. Can you help me ?
I'm using the autonomy_bebop driver but the documentation does not show me how to get images and then process them.

A:

After running the bebop driver you should get an image_raw topic (use rostopic list). You can also verify the camera feed with the GUI tool rqt_image_view. If you see the image feed, then you can process the image data in your program like any other image topic. See image_transport tutorials.
