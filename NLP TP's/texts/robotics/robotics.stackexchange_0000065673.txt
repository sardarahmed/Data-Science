A:

If you want to use wifi it probably makes sense to install ROS on the pi and leverage the power of that. If you want a simple serial connection from the pi to ROS running on a different computer then a different radio infrastruture would make more sense - like zigbee, or one of the many pairs of radio modules that you send serial in one, and it comes out of the other.
