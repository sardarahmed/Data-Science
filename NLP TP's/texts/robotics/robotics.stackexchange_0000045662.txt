Q:

Publishing to /move_base_simple/goal

Hello All,
This is a fairly straightforward question, however I have not been able to find it so far. Could someone please tell me the terminal command to publish move_base_simple/goal.
I know it is something like:
rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped ..........
Really appreciate it. Thank you
Ammar

A:

rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{header: {stamp: now, frame_id: "map"}, pose: {position: {x: 1.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0}}}'

See here for an overview of the command line yaml syntax.
But if you want to send goals programmatically, consider using actionlib. It allows you to preempt goals, i.e. stop the robot, while it is moving. Have a look at this tutorial.
