Q:

skeleton tracking on Ubuntu 16.04

I am using ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. I have Microsoft Kinect first version. I installed openni and nite 1.5.2.23 but I couldn't find a ROS package for skeleton tracking by using nite and openni because I couldn't install openni_tracker for ROS Kinetic. Is there any other way to use Kinect in order to track a skeleton of a body or do I need to change ROS version to Indigo?

A:

You need to clone the openni_tracker package into an active workspace and build it from source using catkin_make. I've built and run it on Kinetic with no issues.

hey, I have managed to install openni_tracker but can't find the NiTE package . Is it still available or is it owned by Apple ?.
Are there any other alternatives to obtain skeletal data from Kinect v1 sensor on ROS kinetic.?
