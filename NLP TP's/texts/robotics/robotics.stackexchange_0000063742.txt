Q:

C# display a point cloud

Hello!
I got the point cloud data (9830400byte array) in windows, which cames from ubuntu ROS Indigo. As far as i know the 9830400byte = 640 * 480 * 4 chanels(rgba) * 8(different z corinates). And i wanted to display it in a windows form. Anyone know any method how can i do it?
Thanks for your help!

How are you getting your point cloud data? Do you have a ROS subscriber on windows, or some other way of transferring the point cloud data?

I have a ROS.NET client on windows, and i subscibed to /camera/depth/points with a sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 message type. And i ment the uint8[] data size is 9830400byte = 640 * 480 * 4 chanels(rgba) * 8(different z corinates). And i wanted to display it.. somehow.. in a windows froms app.

A:

PointClouds come in many forms, with different sets of fields and different data layouts.
The additional metadata in the sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 message describe how many rows and columns there are, which fields are present in each pixel, and what order they're in.
EDIT
PCL has a visualization library. It should be possible to use it from .NET: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18203173/net-and-pcl-point-cloud-library . It will take a little massaging to convert a ROS message into a PCL message, but the formats are basically the same.
