Q:

building nao_driver through ccmake .. and it could not found naoqi_libqi

Hi,
I am trying to build naoqi_driver package through ccmake .., and while configuring I am getting this error.
kindly help as I am new to this.
.......................................................................................................
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "naoqi_libqi" with
any of the following names:
 naoqi_libqiConfig.cmake
 naoqi_libqi-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "naoqi_libqi" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"naoqi_libqi_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"naoqi_libqi" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
has been installed.

Do you have the naoqi_libqi package installed?

Could you  send me the link to install.  I could only find libqi_release which does not have cmakelist.txt, so I could not build it. :/

Where did you find it?

A:

Hi,
I added that package. That package depends on gtest and qibuild. Now I am getting error:
CMake Error at /home/shruti/d-prefix/share/cmake/qibuild/internal/uselib.cmake:80 (find_package):
By not providing "FindGTEST_MAIN.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
"GTEST_MAIN", but CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GTEST_MAIN" with
any of the following names:
 GTEST_MAINConfig.cmake
 gtest_main-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "GTEST_MAIN" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"GTEST_MAIN_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"GTEST_MAIN" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
been installed.
Any one knows about it?
