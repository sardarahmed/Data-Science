Q:

is it possible to install ROS indigo along with kinetic

Hi
I'm working on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I already installed ROS kinetic, however, I couldn't find installation for turtlebot on kinetic, only indigo is supported. Can I find a supported installation for kinetic?
Also, can I install indigo along with kinetic without collision?
Edit: I was able to install gazebo simulator for turtlebot after long hours, however, every time I try to launch turtlebot_world.launch I get error message as shown in the attached screenshot.
Thank you

@Mina Please ask a new question about the simulator, it's a new topic. http://wiki.ros.org/Support

That's alright
thank you

A:

Indigo is not supported on 16.04 Xenial.
Please see the supported platforms in REP 3
Indigo can be installed from source side by side with Kinetic on Xennial if you're willing to do a little debugging. Most dependencies have not changed miuch so it generally will work.
Most TurtleBot packages are released and available on Kinetic: http://repositories.ros.org/status_page/ros_kinetic_default.html?q=turtlebot

many of them written (branch:indigo) next to the source, should they work with kinetic?
Also, I don't know how to install these packages after cloning them from github, can you help with that please?
Thanks
