Q:

Optimize control loop?

Hi there!
I'm constantly getting warnings like

Control loop missed its desired rate of 5.0000Hz... the loop actually took 0.2028 seconds

using move_base to drive my robot around. Obviously something is taking pretty long within the control loop. What do you think, how could I optimize it to reduce the time a control loop cycle takes?
This is what my current rosgraph looks like:

My personal assumption is that there are too many nodes between /MoveBase and /udpOutgoingInterface.
Thanks for your help!
Cheers,
Hendrik

Did you compile the code, or are you using the debs?
Comment by Hendrik Wiese on 2013-09-22:
I'm using the debs. Do you think, compiling the stack explicitly with compiler optimizations for my arch would make that much of a difference?
Comment by David Lu on 2013-09-22:
The debs should be correct, I think.
