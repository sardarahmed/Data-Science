Q:

RGBDSlam_v2 error with rosdep install

Hey so I'm running hydro compiled from source on XUbuntu 13.10 ARM for Odroid and I've been smashing my head against an error for a while now. When I try to run rosdep install rgbdslam after downloading all the right stuff based on this guide
http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/, I get this error
odroid@odroid:~/rgbdslam_catkin_ws$ rosdep install rgbdslam
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rgbdslam: No definition of [message_runtime] for OS version [saucy]

Does anybody know why this might be or how to fix it? I've tried just passing the step and just using catkin_make, but there are a lot of dependencies that I don't know how to acquire, so I'd like to get this to work.

A:

The rosdep command you tried only works for debian installs. It checks for all packages that are (recusrive) dependencies of rgbdslam if they are installed from apt and if not, tries to install them. Since they are not available on saucy, the command fails.
For from-source installs you need to specify the --ignore-src option to make rosdep ignore packages found in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, i.e. the ones in your from-source base install:
rosdep install -i rgbdslam
