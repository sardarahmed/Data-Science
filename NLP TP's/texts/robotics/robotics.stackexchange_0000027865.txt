Q:

What is the best way to share links between models?

I need to make a bunch of models each having an identical copy of a particular link. What's the best way of doing that without copying and pasting the entire XML for the link every time? Can I use an <include> element for this somehow?

A:

I've never tried this, but it should be possible to <include> a model within another one. The SDF parser just expands the links of the included model within the parent model. You can see an example here.
So in your case, you could make a base model which has the link that should be shared, and include that in each new model.
