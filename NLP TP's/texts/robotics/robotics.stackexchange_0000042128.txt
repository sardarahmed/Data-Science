Q:

How to solve 'CMakeFiles/pcl_recognition.dir/src/cg/hough_3d.cpp.o: file not recognized: File truncated'?

I try to build perception_pcl_electric_unstable package.
When I rosmake, I get:
  ira@ira-K42JP:~/code/ros/sam_pcl/perception_pcl_electric_unstable$ rosmake
  [ rosmake ] No package specified.  Building stack ['perception_pcl_electric_unstable']
  [ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['perception_pcl_electric_unstable']

  [ rosmake ] Expanded args ['perception_pcl_electric_unstable'] to:
  ['flann', 'cminpack', 'pcl_ros', 'pcl']
  [ rosmake ] Checking rosdeps compliance for packages perception_pcl_electric_unstable.  This may take a few seconds.

A:

That means the file is corrupted.  It was probably cutoff while being written or something inappropriately wrote to it.
The easiest solution is to run make clean or rosmake --pre-clean on it.  You could also manually just remove the file itself.
