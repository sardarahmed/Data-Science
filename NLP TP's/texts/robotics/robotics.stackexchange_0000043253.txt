Q:

Where is pcd_viewer on ROS fuerte?

In electric, I can run:
  rosrun pcl pcd_viewer office_chair_scene_360.pcd

But I can run it on ROS fuerte.
  sam@sam:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/perception_pcl/pcl_ros/bin$ rosrun pcl pcd_viewer office_chair_scene_360.pcd
  [rosrun] Couldn't find executable named pcd_viewer below /opt/ros/fuerte/share/pcl
  sam@sam:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/perception_pcl/pcl_ros/bin$      

Is something I'm missing?
Where is it?
Thank you~
