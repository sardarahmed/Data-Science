Q:

What is the advantage having seven degrees of freedom in a robotic arm?

I understand what six degrees of freedom is, but I encountered the term of seven degrees of freedom at multiple occasions in robotics. What does is the purpose of that extra degree of freedom?

A:

I guess you are talking about robot arms with 7 DoF like the LBR IIwa from Kuka. 
If you have 6 DoF, a given end-effector pose is only reachable in a single configuration of the robot. If you have additional joints, you can still move the arm without moving the end-effector so that for example the ellbow of the arm is not colliding with parts of the environment. 
A common scenario would be to place an object into a CNC machine. Your end-effector pose is fixed, but the additional dof gives you more freedom so that your arm does not hit the doors of the machine. 

A:

Because the pose of an end effector is 6 dimensional (position(x, y,z) and orientation(ex, ey, ez)), a 6 DOF manipulator is atleast needed to achieve a desired pose. Theoretically, there can be infinite configurations of the robot to achieve the 6D pose.
However, lots of those configurations could have singularities or self/world collisions. There could joint position and torque limits as well, that can curtail the robot's ability to have a feasible inverse kinematics solution and achieve the pose.
Additional degrees of freedom, 7 or more are usually used to overcome the limitations of a 6DOF robot. With 7 or more DOFs, the robot can handle and overcome singularities because there is a larger probability of having atleast 6 DOFs to achieve the desired pose.
Null space optimization is also used here such that the system/robot has redundancy and can use the additional degrees of freedom to pursue secondary tasks like avoiding collisions, maintaining low energy and maintaining a particular elbow/shoulder/wrist configuration.
