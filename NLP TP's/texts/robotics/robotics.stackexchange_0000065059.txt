Q:

rosrun python executable

How do you set which python executable rosrun uses? I am on Arch linux and I assume rosrun defaults to python 3 while trying to interpret python 2.7 source, which of course fails.
EDIT: The issue was in the package scripts. They used "#!/usr/bin/env python" which defaults to python3 on Archlinux. I changed it to "#!/usr/bin/python2".

A:

On Arch, since /usr/bin/python points to Python 3, some steps need to be taken when using ROS:

Force the use of Python 2 by providing Python 2 paths/executables to catkin/CMake (as explained in the wiki),
Patch shebang lines of Python scripts to ensure that Python 2 is used. All the ROS packages available in the AUR are fixed automatically thanks to a script available in ros-build-tools:

# Fix Python2/Python3 conflicts
/usr/share/ros-build-tools/fix-python-scripts.sh -v 2 /path/to/src/dir
