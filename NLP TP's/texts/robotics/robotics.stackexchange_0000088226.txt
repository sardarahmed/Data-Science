Q:

Identification of kinematics of industrial robots

Hi,
I am looking for a way to identify (or calibrate) the kinematic information (Joint angle and robot frame offsets) of my 6-DOF industrial robot. I am aware of the packages robot_calibration and pr2_calibration.
There still does not seem to be a package which simply optimizes (considering the nominal kinematic information from the manufacturer as a set of start parameters) those parameters and parses them into a new, updated URDF file again.
I thought about a package which takes the endeffector frame (calculated via the direct kinematics) and the measured position of the endeffector as the input and finally optimizes after acquiring a couple of poses the new parameters with e.g the Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer.
Is there any package like that?
Otherwise, I am willing to work on that and would like to contribute.

A:

Since I have not gotten any responses yet, I will simply write a little package for kinematic identification purposes and will post the link to the repository here as soon as I get done.
