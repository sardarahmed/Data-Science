Q:

Asus Xtion live pro on USB 3.0 - ROS-kinetic - Ubuntu 16.04

I tried to use
roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
to connect my asus xtion pro live.
But i have errors : Warning: USB events thread - failed to set priority. This might cause loss of data.
What may cause this problem?
I use ROS kinetic, Ubuntu16.04, my asus xtion live pro supports openni2 not openni. It seems the answers here are mostly about previous versions of softwares. Anyone encounter such problems in latest versions?

A:

This is only a warning. Your Xtion should still work.

OpenNI tries to set the USB async
thread priority to critical. This
works on Linux only with root
privileges. For a normal user, the
program will throw this warning. To
get rid of this warning, run the
program as root. source
