Q:

having problem using vision_opencv to get image from kinect?

I have kinect which is working well and I can get image by running openni.launch and rviz.
I want to subscribe this kinect image in to a node and change it to opencv image format from ros image format for image processing.
for doing the same I am following the following page.
http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/wiki/index.php/How_to_make_ROS_and_Opencv_work_together
however using rosmake it is showing following error .....
/opt/ros/groovy/share/vision_opencv/roscv/src/simplecanny.cpp:12:32: fatal error: cv_bridge/CvBridge.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.

A:

The cv_bridge/CvBridge.h is old and not used anymore. Use API given in
#include <cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h>

instead...

If i take out this #include statement:
#include <cv_bridge/CvBridge.h>

Then I lose the functionality of my code, yet I don't even have that package. How do I install CvBridge.h from the command line? I am gettting this error:
fatal error: cv_bridge/CvBridge.h: No such file or directory
