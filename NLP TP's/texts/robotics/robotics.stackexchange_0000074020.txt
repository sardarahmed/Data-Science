Q:

The move_base isn't subscribing to /robot1/map

Hello everyone,
I'm trying to add a namespace to my robot. Firstly, I added _${arg robot_name} after all frames. I can control my different robots with rqt_robot_steering via their own control topics, for example, with this /robot1/mobile_base_controller/cmd_vel on gazebo. But I think that isn't important information, whatever;
When I try to run amcl, /robot1/move_base doesn't subscribe to /robot1/map. I'm already remapping in move_base node:
    ...
    <param name="base_global_planner" type="string" value="navfn/NavfnROS" />
    <param name="base_local_planner" value="dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS" />
    <rosparam file="$(find mrp2_navigation)/config/dwa_planner_params.yaml" command="load" />

    <remap from="odom" to="odom_$(arg robot_name)" />
    <remap from="cmd_vel" to="$(arg robot_name)/nav_vel" />
    <remap from="map" to="/$(arg robot_name)/map" /> 
</node>

And setting in map_server:
    <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" 
          args="$(find mrp2_navigation)/maps/milvus_repo.yaml" output="screen">
        <param name="frame_id" value="/$(arg robot_name)/map" />
    </node>

Also Here is rqt_graph output:
(for newcomers to this website: right click image and say "Open image in new tab" for readable resolution)

What should I set? Or What can I do?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I've removed remapping. And problem solved. Launching node in
<group ns="optimus_prime">
</group>

tag already remaps topics automatically.

I got same problem with you, but I didn't add remapping in launch file, and move_base still not subscribe /robotx/map or /map. Do you have any idea of that. Thank you so much.

run roswtf and look at which topics are listened instead of the wanted one. Or which topics are orphan

I solved the problem by change "/base_footprint" to "base_footprint" in local/global_costmap_params.yaml, Thks.
