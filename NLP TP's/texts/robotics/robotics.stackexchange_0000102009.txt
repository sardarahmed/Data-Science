Q:

Can't install ROS package listed on index from either apt or rosdep

Hi,
I want to download this package called "grpc" for compiling Protobuf messages. However, on my Noetic installation, running sudo apt install ros-noetic-grpc (or even sudo apt list ros-noetic-g*) turns up nothing. Other Noetic packages like e.g.:
ros-noetic-grid-map-ros/focal 1.6.4-1focal.20220512.131357 amd64
ros-noetic-grid-map-rviz-plugin-dbgsym/focal 1.6.4-1focal.20220512.132257 amd64
ros-noetic-grid-map-rviz-plugin/focal 1.6.4-1focal.20220512.132257 amd64
ros-noetic-grid-map-sdf-dbgsym/focal 1.6.4-1focal.20220221.112002 amd64
ros-noetic-grid-map-sdf/focal 1.6.4-1focal.20220221.112002 amd64

are showing up, but not the one I want. I also tried rosdep install grpc to "cannot find all required resources." I'm on an x64 20.04 machine, and my ros-latest.list has deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu focal main. Would anyone know why I can't find this package, or if they're able to see it on other machines?

Looks like it's not actually available in the repositories right now.
Why? I don't know. You'd have to ask the maintainer.

A:

@gvdhoorn Thank you for the link, this is a good resource! I reached out to the maintainer as you suggested and found out that its because it was just published recently, and a "sync" hasn't happened yet for the package to be available on apt. Appreciate it!
