Q:

turtlebot_bringup failed to connect to iCreate

Recently, I have connected ArbotiX to my turtlebot, and I'm not sure at what moment, but iCreate is no longer recognized by ubuntu.

With iCreate, Kinect and arbotix connected to Ubuntu, dmesg shows following:

Both Usb port are used as FTDI, when only one should be. I'm not sure how does this happen, and I hope to find some help here. Thanks.
I searched here for suggestions and found similar topic http://answers.ros.org/question/3094/cant-get-data-from-create-robot-error-reading-from where I've asked for solution, but it looks like my post was removed.

A:

Since both the arbotix and create are using FTDI chips, I'd suggest using a udev rule to assign a new dev entry for each: /dev/arbotix /dev/create or something similar based on the FTDI serial #s.
Here's what I use to differentiate my create from my arduino (you'll have to change this, but you can use the basics for reference):
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="FTDI", ATTRS{product}=="FT232R USB UART", SYMLINK+="arduino"

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="FTDI", ATTRS{product}=="US232R", SYMLINK+="create"

This gives me /dev/create and /dev/arduino dev entries, even though they use similar FTDI ICs. I was lucky enough that their product descriptions varried, you may find that they are the same product but have different serials.
Update: If you want to differentiate by their ID_SERIAL, it should be something like this:
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", 
ENV{ID_VENDOR}=="FTDI", ENV{ID_SERIAL}=="FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A400C1Q6", 
SYMLINK+="create" 

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", 
ENV{ID_VENDOR}=="FTDI", ENV{ID_SERIAL}=="FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A2001nbT", 
SYMLINK+="arbotix" 

Stick that in a text file called 70-myrobot.rules or something similar and throw it /etc/udev/rules.d/
Note: This is just an example and in reality you'll actually have to figure out which serial is attached to which device.  Start with one being unplugged, use udevadm to match the serial. Then fix the rule accordingly. The one I provided you has a 50/50 shot of being correct ;-)

You can also create a generic rule that writes the serial# in the device name: SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", SYMLINK+="sensors/ftdi_%s{serial}", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout"
