Q:

how to echo custom-defined message remotely?

There are two machines, A and B, connected via Ethernet cable, and their connections are established. One of the ROS package implemented at the machine A has custom messages, and I would like it to be read at the machine B by using the command rostopic echo <topic-name>.
When I typed the command, I got the following error message.
ERROR: Cannot load message class for [<message-name>]. Are your messages built?

Does this mean that I have to build the custom message at the machine B as well? If so, how?

That would be the most straightforward way, yes.

If so, how?

Exactly the same way as you built the package on machine A:

create a Catkin workspace
copy the sources of the package that contains your msg definitions to machine B
catkin_make
`source devel/setup.bash

rostopic should now be able to find your message definitions.

Note that a convenient way to share sources of packages between multiple machines would be use a VCS like git, svn or hg.
