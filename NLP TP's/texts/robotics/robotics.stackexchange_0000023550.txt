Q:

6D pose estimation of a known 3D CAD object

I'm looking for a codebase for 6DOF pose estimation of a known 3D CAD object with RGB or RGBD. It must be:
-Usable commercially (licensed under BSD, MIT, BOOST, etc.), not GPL.
-Easy to setup and use (having a running colab example would be great)
-The training time required for a new CAD object should be on the order of hours, not days.
-State of the art of near state of the art results. (See https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/home/ for benchmarks)
Are there any libraries fitting these requirements?

A:

I would like to know about this too.
Vuforia combines libraries for several platforms (Android, iOS) and provides pose estimation. It uses 2D feature extracted from CAD and the feature extraction is fairly quick (minutes, not hours), but it is not CAD based pose estimation and the results are average (drift, stability, accuracy).
