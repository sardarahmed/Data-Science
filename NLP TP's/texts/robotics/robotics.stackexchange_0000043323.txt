A:

Setup a navigation stack for your robot, see the turorial http://ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup. Then use gazebo for the robot simulation and from rviz send commands to /move_base topic (another tutorial http://ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/Using_rviz_with_the_Navigation_Stack.
