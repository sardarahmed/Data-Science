Q:

Multiple ROS installation on single machine

Can I have multiple versions of ROS or ROS2 installed on a single machine or PC?

A:

Yes. See discussion here: https://answers.ros.org/question/187548/can-i-install-multiple-ros-version-on-the-same-machine/
Each ROS distro (both 1 & 2) installs its programs into /opt/ros/{distro}, so you can have them installed side-by-side with no conflict.
However you should only use one distro at a time. In order to use a distro, you source its setup script in your shell, e.g.:
$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
...the remainder of this session will be in the humble environment

If you plan to have multiple ROS versions installed and use them regularly, I would not recommend doing this inside your .bashrc or equivalent login script, because you need to avoid having multiple distros sourced in the same shell. Whenever you want to start using a distro, just source its setup script manually.
