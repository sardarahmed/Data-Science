Q:

Error running ccny_rgbd

Hey I'm trying to run the ccny_rgbd package. I have everything built properly but when I run
ccny_openni_launch openni.launch publish_cloud:=true

I get a lot of errors.
nft@nft-desktop:~/ros_workspace/ccny_rgbd_tools$ roslaunch
ccny_openni_launch openni.launch publish_cloud:=true

Did you find out how to fix this? I get a failure loading RGBDImageProcNodelet.

A:

Well not a fix but I did a fresh install of everything, including Ubuntu and then it started working fine. What I think the problem is that there is something happening if you have both ccny_rgbd and rgbdslam installed. Maybe ccny_rgbd is using an older version of some calls or something like that.
