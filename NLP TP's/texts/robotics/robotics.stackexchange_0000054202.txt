Q:

failed to create base_local_planner after changing global planner

I want to do the comparison of global planning methods available in navigation stack.
When I change global planner of move_base from navfn to carrot_planner I`m getting following error:
Failed to create the base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS planner, are you sure it is properly registered and that the containing library is built? Exception: MultiLibraryClassLoader: Could not create class of type base_local_planner::TrajectoryPlannerROS 

[move_base-2] process has died
In order to change planning method I modified the launch file by including this line
<param name="base_global_planner" value="carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner"/>

Why is this happening?

Go back a step. Does your launch file work if you don't include that line?

Yes, works like a charm. It also works when i set value to "navfn/NavfnROS" (default planner).

I have the same problem. Works great by setting navfn/NavfnROS but dies when using carrot_planner/CarrotPlanner. I'm using ros-groovy.

I have the same problem. Have you solved it?

Same problem here. Carrot Planner works fine with dwa_local_planner, but I get the same error when trying to use it with base_local_planner.

A:

A) Make sure all your planners are built. B) Try this launch file http://pastebin.com/FDxzwxaD (add your own map instead of some_package)
