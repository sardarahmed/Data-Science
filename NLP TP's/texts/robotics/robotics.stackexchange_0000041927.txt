Q:

Move_base Costmaps vs. NavFn Costmap

When using standard PR2 Navigation (roslaunch pr2_2dnav pr2_2dnav.launch) there are three costmaps listed.
 $> rostopic list | grep /obstacles
 /move_base_node/NavfnROS/NavfnROS_costmap/obstacles
 /move_base_node/global_costmap/obstacles
 /move_base_node/local_costmap/obstacles

Why does Navfn (which is the global planner) get its own costmap? Shouldn't it just use global_costmap?

A:

Navfn uses the same global costmal as the local planner. The topics are just for publishing (e.g. for debugging), navfn does not get the costmap via that topic.
By default navfn does not publish anything on that topic. You can imagine that it is possible to use navfn without move_base, having its own topics is for such cases, maybe.
