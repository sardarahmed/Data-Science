Q:

Build ROS completely from source code?

Hi.
I'm looking for some tutorial about ROS building by checking out source from repository, not by rosinstall.
Is there any one who compiles ROS completely from source?

A:

rosinstall does check out repositories and compiles code from source, it's just a convenient tool to check out everything at once:
http://ros.org/wiki/rosinstall
If you don't want to use rosinstall, you can just download the rosinstall file, open it, and check out all the repositories defined in there yourself.
