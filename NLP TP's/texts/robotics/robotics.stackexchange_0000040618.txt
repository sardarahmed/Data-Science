Q:

Exception AttributeError when starting roscore

I recently installed fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04 using the ros-fuerte debs.
Now when I run roscore I get the following error:
  Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored

Is this normal? Things seem to work for the most part.

This is apparently a bug in Python as mentioned in following ticket and it shouldn't cause any harm.
