Q:

roslaunch: using ampersand (&) in gscam config

Hi guys, I am trying to use an ampersand (&) in my launch file for gscam but it's apparently bad syntax. Here's the output:
 Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 7, column 92
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Here is my launch file:
<launch>
  <arg name="cam_name" value="my_camera" />

  <!-- Start the GSCAM node -->
  <env name="GSCAM_CONFIG" 
      value="souphttpsrc location=http://10.16.63.224/control/faststream.jpg?stream=full&fps=0 timeout=5 ! jpegdec ! ffmpegcolorspace" />
  <node pkg="gscam" type="gscam" name="$(arg cam_name)">
    <param name="camera_name" value="$(arg cam_name)" />
    <remap from="camera/image_raw" to="$(arg cam_name)/image_raw" />
  </node>

</launch>

If I remove the "&fps=0" from the end of location, then the launch file works, but I need it there to operate my camera properly. Is there a way to use "&" in a launchfile? maybe a delimiter?
Thanks,
-Frank

A:

I figured it out. I googled the issue under general XML syntax, not just a roslaunch problem.
You can use "& amp;" for the "&". So my code now becomes this and it works!
<launch>
  <arg name="cam_name" value="my_camera" />

  <!-- Start the GSCAM node -->
  <env name="GSCAM_CONFIG" 
      value="souphttpsrc location=http://10.16.63.224/control/faststream.jpg?stream=full&amp;fps=0 timeout=5 ! jpegdec ! ffmpegcolorspace" />
  <node pkg="gscam" type="gscam" name="$(arg cam_name)">
    <param name="camera_name" value="$(arg cam_name)" />
    <remap from="camera/image_raw" to="$(arg cam_name)/image_raw" />
  </node>

</launch>
