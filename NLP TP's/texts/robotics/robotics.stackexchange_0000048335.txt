Q:

ros on lynxmotion AL5D

Hi everyone,
Sorry for my poor English.
I have a project about lynx AL5D, a robotic arm. My teacher recommanded me to use ROS. I have read the tutorials, but I still have no idea about the project. The tutorials talk a lot about the service, topics, launch files... but it doesn't talk about how to make my robotic arm move.
I just want to use the keyboard to control the robotic arm to turn left right. I will appricate if you can give me some suggestions

Hello! to move the arm you need a driver. In the case of lynxmotion arms they come with serial RS232 based interface. The way to move the arm is by sending 3 bytes to the board. I have a robot with lynmotion arm l6ac-kt, check the code here!

A:

There is a driver for the arm which is found here.  You would need to publish the desired joint angles to make the arm move.  The driver takes care of the communication between your machine and the ssc32.
