Q:

Gazebo menu save is always grayed out..why is this?

Gazebo menu save is always grayed out. The Save As menu is not. Why is this. I tried permissions on the directory and file but still does not allow save.

A:

I believe this is normal ... it will only let you save a world that you do a saveAs on first. You can also using SaveAs locate and replace the current world in your files. The launch world file could have been a composite or from a non local source.
