Q:

Starting state out of bounds for a real UR robot

I am working with a real UR5e robot and I can see the current robot pose and its update when it's moved manualy in moveit.
However, I am not able to plan, because it's always Failed result, due to:
You can start planning now!

[ INFO] [1570454211.959254809]: Planning request received for MoveGroup action. Forwarding to planning pipeline.
[ WARN] [1570454211.959419965]: Joint 'wrist_1_joint' from the starting state is outside bounds

And other errors follow. Why I am representing the real robot pose properly but I've got this error?

Because rendering current state (RViz) is completely disconnected from being able to plan new motions for your robot (MoveIt).
If you have the option: don't run the join-limited versions of the .launch files or make sure your robot is not outside the plannable range for each of its joints.

Thank you, Now the planning is performed successfuly. However, when I Execute it, remains as:
[ INFO] Path simplification took 0.095551 seconds and changed from 3 to 2 states
[ INFO] Received new trajectory execution service request...
And robot doesn't move. I am missing anything? Thank you.

That would seem to be a different problem. Please don't post follow-up questions in comments under answers.

Also: you appear to be cross-posting this to ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver#354 and ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver#339. Please don't do that, it's not very nice.
