Q:

How to use ros-noetic-husky?

I am currently following the first tutorial of clearpath to learn ROS. The tutorial is already a bit outdated and uses Ros Kinetic. However, I installed Ros Noetic on my computer.
In section 'Drive a husky' (http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/ros/Drive%20a%20Husky.html), they asked to get some packages:

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-husky-desktop

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-husky-simulator

However I receive the following error when executing these:

E: Unable to locate package ros-kinetic-husky-desktop

What can I do, to solve this error?

A:

Currently there is no ROS Noetic package for Husky, however, you can clone noetic-devel and build from source. There are few dependencies required:
