Q:

How to set the maximum number of contacts with Dart engine?

Hello,
I am using dart as physics engine for Gazebo 9. I need to reduce the maximum number of contacts between two colliding body. In the sdf documentation, there is a “max_contacts” parameter which should set this. However, I suspect it only work with ode physics engine, because I tested different values with dart and there was no effect on the actual number of contacts.
How can I set the maximum number of contacts from a sdf file, if possible ? If it is not implemented, is there any plan for the implementation of this feature ?
thank you for your answer.

hello, sorry for the late answer, no the only "workaround" is to use the ode engine...
