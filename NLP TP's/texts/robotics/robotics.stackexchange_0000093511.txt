Q:

Merge multi-robot's maps

Hello, I want to know whether navigation_tutorials can merge multi-robot's maps? Or just try to control different robots? Is it real time, or just offline?

A:

The problem of merging maps between robots is a slam problem. There are different solutions to do slam in ROS.
(Amongst others gmapping, hector slam and cartographer)
One solution that is known to support multiple agents is  cartographer: https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/going_further.html#multi-trajectories-slam

Thanks a lot, if i want to merge maps using gmapping, do you have any suggestion? For example, a framework to realize it or some related work? It seems that Gmapping does not have this function itself.

I have some problem with /start_trajectory, like it will say topic [scan] is already used.can you speak more specific about it,Thanks in advance.

This is cartographer specific, yes? I am not an expert on that. I would suggest opening a new question and clearly describe the problem you have with cartographer.
