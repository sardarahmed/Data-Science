Q:

pointcloud access data

Hi
I have a subscribed topic with the type sensor_msgs::PointCloud2.
I do not need the pcl library. I just want to iterate through each point and take the Z value. but i have no clue how to do this with sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 and i dont find an example.
Do I really need pcl for easy element access?
Ciao

A:

Please look into the documentation of sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 (http://ros.org/doc/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html) and you can use the field "data" to access z values.
