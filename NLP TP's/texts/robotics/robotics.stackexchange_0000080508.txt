Q:

Add library to CMakeLists

Hello all,
I am very new to ROS and I trying to include a library eigen-eigen-67e894c6cd8f which is available in /usr/local/include to the CMakeLists.txt.  I have tried doing the below command but I have had no success. I am able to use this library outside ros and it works fine. However, when I do catkin_make it throws a bunch of errors. My package is named "my_pcl" and "test" is my executable. Thanks in advance
include_directories(/usr/local/include/eigen-eigen-67e894c6cd8f)
add_executable(test eigen-eigen-67e894c6cd8f)

A:

System-wide libraries are resolved by CMake relative to  /usr/local/lib if you are using a 32-bit architecture machine or /usr/local/lib64 if you are on a 64-bit architecture.
Something seems wrong with the location where your library is domiciled. Either fix this by copying the appropriate library file over to usr/local/lib or manually tell cmake to look in usr/local/include. The first option is more standard and I would choose that over the latter.
