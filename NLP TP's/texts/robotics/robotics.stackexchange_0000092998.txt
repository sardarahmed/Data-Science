Q:

describing layers in costmap .yaml files

so, we have 3 .yaml files:

common_costmap.yaml

global_costmap.yaml

local_costmap.yaml

For example, let global_costmap has these layers:
  plugins:
      - {name: static,            type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"}
      - {name: inflation,         type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}
      - {name: sonar,             type: "range_sensor_layer::RangeSensorLayer"}

where am i supposed to describe layers params, in global_costmap or common costmap or in both?
i mean these lines:
static:
   map_topic: /map
   subscribe_to_updates: true

inflation:
   inflation_radius: 0.4

sonar:
   frame: range_sensor_frame
   topics: ["/sensor_us", "/sensor_ir"]
   no_readings_timeout: 2.0
   clear_on_max_reading: false

A:

You can either choose  common_costmap.yaml or global_costmap.yaml. Obviously, local_costmap.yaml makes no sense.
It is important to load them to the correct namespace, i.e. into global_costmap, whether you have it in common_costmap.yaml or global_costmap.yaml, as it is shown on this example.
Whether you put it in common_costmap.yaml or global_costmap.yaml should be decided whether you actually have the same configuration of a layer for both, the global and local costmap, or not.
