Q:

how to display a mesh with texture in RViz?

Hello All,
All am trying is loading an OBJ model from a file and display/visualize using RViz. Or consider I have a node that publishes a new mesh and corresponding texture data @30Hz. Is there a way to display this 3D mesh with texture in RViz? Thank you for any help.
Best,
CV

A:

It is possible to display an arbitrary mesh in Rviz, but you cannot currently display a OBJ mesh.   Currently you can display a  collada, stl, and Ogre mesh file.  You display them using a marker message.  You can find out more about displaying meshes with markers by looking at the  Mesh Resource marker .
