Q:

error while building fovis_ros

Hi tried to build package from this source. [git https://github.com/srv/fovis.git] I have successfully built libfovis library. But after this i am getting the following error.
"A lot of code" followed by
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [/home/bhargav/catkin_ws/devel/lib/fovis_ros/fovis_stereo_odometer] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fovis/fovis_ros/CMakeFiles/fovis_stereo_odometer.dir/all] Error 2

Please help me build this package successfully.

Hi Bhargav,
only with those lines makes it impossible to tell. Could you please paste the full output somewhere and give us the link? For example at https://gist.github.com/

@Miquel thank you! i have posted the error here https://gist.github.com/bhargavjha/b0a150457c34f26373aa. Also i was not aware of gist. Thanks for it too.

A:

As the issue is related to our ros node, I'll follow the discussion at https://github.com/srv/fovis/issues/11.
Please, refer to the github issue for more information.
