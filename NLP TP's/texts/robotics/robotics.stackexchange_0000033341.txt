Q:

What is the robot_pose_ekf current state?

I would like to know if the package robot_pose_ekf is going to achieve the roadmap goals in electric. Or if someone is working in it.
We are very interested in this package since we started to work in a package very similar that mixes Odometry.msg from different sensors and finally gives a filtered odometry.
Thanks!

A:

I'm not aware of anyone working to extend the robot_pose_ekf, but I'd be happy to help out anyone that's interested in building upon the codebase. Also note that the stack is already frozen for the upcoming Electric release, so new features will only make it into Fuerte.

Yes, Fuerte is the release after Electric.
