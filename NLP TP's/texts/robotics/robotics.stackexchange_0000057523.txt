Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: roscore error

I have searched but have not found anything that adequately solves my problem.
When I type in "roscore" to test ros and make sure my installation was successful it displays this error:
roscore invalid <param>  tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion roslaunch] returned with code [1] 
Param xml is <param command="rosversion roslaunch" name="rosversion"/>

Any help is appreciated!

What is your OS and ROS version? Have you installed from binaries or from source?
Comment by GWall on 2014-02-26:
I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and ROS version hydro

What do you get if you run rosversion roslaunch manually?
Comment by GWall on 2014-03-03:
It says "Cannot locate [roslaunch]

A:

This is usually symptomatic of not having your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH set correctly.
This usually happens if you either:

Haven't sourced /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash or
You've overwritten your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH instead of appending to it

What do you get for   env | grep ROS?
Comment by GWall on 2014-03-03:
This is what I got:
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros...
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/forklift/forklift-workspace:ROS_PACKAGE_PATH...
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311...
ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost...
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=...
ROS_DISTRO=hydro...
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros...

Please update your question with this so it's readable. The exact output is important. Is there a literal "ROS_PACKAGE_PATH" in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?

I appreciate your help! Your last comment gave me a thought and so I went to check the path and discovered that I had removed that file so ROS was searching for something that didn't exist. I checked with it in and its been working!!
