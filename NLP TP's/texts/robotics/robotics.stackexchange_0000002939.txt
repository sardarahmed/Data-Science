Q:

What does this "inverse" peak mean? (step function)

I identified my system and now I am trying to tune PI regulator since I think I do not need D.
I came across this graph while Matlabing and I do not know what does it mean.
I am using pidtune() to get my P and I values. (I think computation is all correct, I made model in simulink to confirm). Anyway see my picture and arrow is pointing at what I do not understand. Why is my system going below zero first?
It is supposed to be water flow regulator.

Transfer function:
$$ \frac{-0.311s + 0.05548}{s^2 + 0.06882s + 0.0007626}$$
Continuous-time PI controller in parallel form:
$$K_p + K_i * \frac{1}{s}$$
With $K_p = 0.256$, $K_i = 0.000342$

A:

What you seem to be concerned about is the well known nonminimum-phase effect of the zero $s_0=0.05548/0.311$ in the right half of the s-plane.
You should first ask yourself whether this lag has a physical interpretation in the context of your system. Many physical systems expose such a dynamics, but here it might also depend on how you carried out the identification.
Then, to properly account for such a lag, if it really exists and is not introduced by the identification process, you should make use of proper techniques. For example, look here.
