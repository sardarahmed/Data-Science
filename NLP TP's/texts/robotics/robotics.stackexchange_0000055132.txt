Dear All,
I am new to ROS and ubuntu, I am using ROS package which I cloned from github
When I run roslaunch phantom_ns.launch
I get the following error,
[phantom_ns.launch] requires the 'DefaultPHANToM' arg to be set.
Please guide me how can I resolve this error.
Thank you.

Thank you for your reply.. I resolved the issue. In launch file there are two arg defined and I was not setting their values in roslaunch command..I used below command which worked for me..
roslaunch phantom_ns.launch PHANToM:=true publish_rate:=5

You could add a default value into you launch file. It should look something like

instead adding them each time in console
