Q:

rosanswers formatting

hey I have another question but this comes first, how can I paste some xml code here to format my question? I've tried the 101010 thing but it still deletes a big chunk of the code within < / node > tags

A:

How are you copy and pasting it? In my experience, it's easiest to copy and paste the code into the text box, highlight it, then click the 101010 button (or hit Ctrl-k). Don't click the button first, that usually only works for very small bits of code.
