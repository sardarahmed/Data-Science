Q:

rxplot displaying wrong values

I publish a NavSatFix message on a topic. Using rostopic echo I can see that the longitude value is 13.475883. But when plotting the value with rxplot I get a value around 0.016.
I also observed similar behaviour for one of my own messages containing a set of float64.
Any ideas?

A:

Are you sure its displaying the wrong value? matplotlib, which rxplot uses, sometimes readjusts the y-axis if the value range is small so that the Y-value is an offset from a fixed value.  The fixed value will be displayed on the axis as well.

It seems you are right. Clicking on the line show the correct value. But I saw no fixed value displayed. But doing a configure I then saw the fixed value on the top. It was displayed but under the "menu" so you did not see it. This was very confusing.
