Q:

Saving a whole plot in rxplot

I would like to ask anyone who knows any possibility that I can save a full/whole shot of the plot in rxplot. Any command line is also okay(any will do). At the moment, I only know that I can save the current plot/window, it's a kind of screen shot. If there is one, it will be cool.

Yes, exactly! I need the entire figure of it(.PNG will do). How do I achieve that?

Are you looking for something that can save a .PNG of the entire figure or more like saving a MATLAB .fig file, where you can reopen it and interact with the plot (e.g. zooming, panning, etc)?

A:

You're probably best off recording the topic to a bag file, then using rxbag to plot the data instead.  rxbag is great on zooming in/out of data, which should give you the functionality you need.

Does rxbag has such a functionality to save the entire figure of a graph? And is it be able to plot 2 plots from different topic to be plotted on a single coordinate?
