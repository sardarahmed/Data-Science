Q:

compiling gzweb with gazebo 7.3

I tried compiling gzweb for the latest version of gazebo..
 Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 7.3.0
Copyright (C) 2012-2016 Open Source Robotics Foundation.
Released under the Apache 2 License.

Node version v4.2.6
But I am unable to compile as it throws errors like
gzweb/tools/gzcoarse.cc:113:28: error: ‘const class gazebo::common::SubMesh’ has no member named ‘GetVertex’
     inVertex = _inSubMesh->GetVertex(i);

and this seems to be true as there doesn't seem to be any GetVertex in the Submesh? Does gzweb work with gazebo7 or should I downgrade?

A:

GzWeb currently doesn't support new versions of Node, so you'll need to downgrade to 0.10 first. According to these instructions, first remove your current node:
 sudo apt-get remove nodejs

then install the 0.10 version:
 curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.10 | sudo -E bash -
 sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

You can use similar instructions to go back to node 4 if you need to.

The default branch of GzWeb has been compatible with Gazebo 7 for a while, but the latest "release" version 1.2.0 was not. I just created a new branch gzweb_1.3.0 from default, which should build against gazebo7. So you could just pull and use the new branch ;)
