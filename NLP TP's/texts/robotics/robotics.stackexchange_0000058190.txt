Q:

Is Openni2 working with PCL?

Hello,
I've read somewhere that you can't use openni2 with pcl is that true ? I can't find any information that is not outdated.
The thing is had trouble installing openni while openni2 works on my computer.

You might also want to ask this on the PCL mailing list: http://pointclouds.org/contact.html - I can say that Openni2 works pretty well with ROS (openni2_camera package)
