Q:

ar_pose on ROS Hydro

Hi everyone!
I've been using ar_pose on ROS Fuerte for some time, but I want to update and start working with ROS Hydro. However, ar_pose doesn't work when using Groovy and Hydro.
Is there any update or any changes that should be made in order to have it working?
Thanks!

This might be obvious, but make sure you're using the proper repo (https://github.com/IHeartEngineering/ar_tools). It's been moved around a bit lately.

Thank you for your comment! Well, I'm using this repo.

A:

There were some compilation errors, after solving them, it works fine.
It's a rosbuild package, so you have to create a rosbuild workspace then download ar_pose and build it.

Hi Artem. Thank you for this sugestion! It still doesn't work. Here is what I do:
$roscore;
$rosrun camera1394 camera1394_node _video_mode:=640x480_rgb8 /camera/image_raw:=usb_cam/image_raw;
$ROS_NAMESPACE=usb_cam rosrun image_proc image_proc;
$rosrun ar_pose ar_multi;
$rosrun rviz rviz

Also, I add "Camera", "Grid" and "Marker" on ''rviz'' and I set Fixed Frame to "/camera", Marker Topic to "visualization_marker", and Image Topic to "/usb_cam/image_raw".
Any suggestion?
