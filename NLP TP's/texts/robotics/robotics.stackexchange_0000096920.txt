Awesome! In that case, I converted my comment to an answer so that this question will show up as answered.

A:

Seems likely to be a problem with rqt_tf_tree specifically and not necessarily anything wrong with the /tf data available. Maybe try with rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree --clear-config? Alternatively try with rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree -b pyqt or rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree -b pyside. You could also run rqt alone and add the TF Tree plugin (it's under the Visualization section).
As a sanity check you could use rosrun tf view_frames to generate a PDF of the /tf tree to make sure there isn't anything wrong with the underlying data.
