Q:

rosserial_arduino setup problem

im installing Arduino IDE Setup following the steps
cd /src
git clone https://github(dot)com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
cd 
catkin_make
catkin_make install
source /install/setup.bash
This suppose to create a ros_lib library in the /install directory, but it doesn't.

A:

The ros_lib should be installed in your Arduino "sketchbook/libraries".  To install the ros_lib in the sketchbook use ros rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py <sketchbook>/libraries/  .  You will have to make the libraries folder and the sketchbook should automatically be generated in the home directory after the Arduino IDE is opened once.
