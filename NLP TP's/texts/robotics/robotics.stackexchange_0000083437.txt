Q:

Having a Master to control two separate system with ROS-Hydro

Hi,
I am newbie in ROS. I wonder if we can create a master control to interact with two separate systems which has ROS hydro installed. Or to be appropriate,  Can I control two separate ROS Hydro using another computer which acts like a master?

Maybe this is the topic I am looking for. Thank you @l4ncelot

A:

ROS provides this functionality. Have a look at this guide on ROS across multiple machines. Here is network setup guide to make it work.
To launch nodes on different machines with single launch file have a look at roslaunch's machine tag here.
