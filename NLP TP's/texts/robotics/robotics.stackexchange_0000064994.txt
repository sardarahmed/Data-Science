Q:

moving turtlebot in simulation using a C++ program

I want to learn, how to move turtlebot in simulation using a c++ program. I am following ROS Tutorial Part 3. However, the tutorial used electric while I am using hydro. As there is no turtlebot_key.cpp in hydro, I collected it from this site. I Used roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch and made the node executed. It is showing the following message.
Reading from keyboard
---------------------------.
Use arrow keys to move the turtlebot.
However turtlebot in gazebo doesn't move. I wish to know, does turtlebot_key.cpp work in hydro? Do I need to change it?
Your help is highly appreciated.
Thank you

A:

You could use teleop for moving the turtlebot around using keyboard in gazebo.
Use:
$ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

Yes, I can use this. However I want to see the code (C++) so that I can learn and modify the code to control the turtlebot. I would like to ask if someone has the code.
Thank you
