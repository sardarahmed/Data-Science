Q:

Gazebo seems to be crashing

This is after much fooling around, so I feel like some state, cache, or something else is corrupted. I have rebooted the operating system and that didn't seem to do it. Do you maybe see what's wrong? Thanks!

A:

Not very helpful response: it has stopped crashing. Of all the things I tried, including rebooting the computer and killing all terminal windows, perhaps killing all processes that had /ros/ in their name did the trick. I am not sure but I think that was it.

This happens once in a while. I use htop to find and kill processes that won't die.
