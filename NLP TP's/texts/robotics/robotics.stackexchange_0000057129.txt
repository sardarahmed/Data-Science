Q:

using services from android_map_manager and other rapps

I am having some trouble. I have found a resource online for the 'android_map_manager', for example.
http://wiki.ros.org/android_map_manager
I have figured out how to start the app from my program. Now I would like to use some of the services that the online resource says are available to me. I cannot see them (they are services) when I type 'rossrv list' and when I try to access them from my program I get a message like this:
[ERROR] [WallTime: 1391876649.155091] [Client 0] [id: call_service:/android/list_maps:31] call_service InvalidServiceException: Service /android/list_maps does not exist

I feel though that this should work, as I know the app manager is running. I have this in my logs:
[WARN] [WallTime: 1391877076.029768] App Manager : an app is already running [turtlebot_core_apps/android_map_manager]

If I could find out how to list the maps, I could figure out how to rename, delete, etc. My next goals are to implement services in the 'android_make_a_map' rapp and possibly the nav rapp too. I did notice that the map_store package is being started by the launcher. Is the map_store package working independently of the map_manager? The launcher that I'm using is a slightly modified version of the 'minimal_with_appmanager.launch' file. Thanks.

A:

I don't know if that roswiki page is up to date - it's quite old compared to the current android release. Should be close though similar topics with similar types should be floating around.

android_map_manager is just a launcher that launches a database and the map_store.
prefixing it with android is probably misleading - the use case is for working with the actual android app, but it doesn't have to have anything to do with the android apps to be useful still.
map_store is just a frontend for easily writing and retrieving maps from that database.

Is the map_store package working independently of the map_manager?

As mentioned above, map_manager is just a launcher that fires up the map store. Maybe there is more to this question than I'm understanding though..

So, I've given up on the android based rapps. I'm now trying to manage starting and stopping different nodes from their launchers and see if I cannot control the turtlebot at the same time. This is more like where I started from. I do have the new problem that nodes seem to keep running longer than I want them to even if I try to kill them with 'rosnode kill'. If nothing works I will try to return to the rapps.
