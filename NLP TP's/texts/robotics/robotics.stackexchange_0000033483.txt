Q:

what version of nvidia-cg does ogre want?

I'm trying to install desktop-full on a FC15 machine. I installed the latest version of Cg from nvidia's website, and ogre gives me this when I try to rosmake:
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.6.0/../../../libCg.so when searching for -lCg

A:

This sounds like you downloaded a 32-bit version of Cg but are running 64-bit linux. Can you make sure you downloaded the version of Cg that matches your Linux architecture (32bit vs 64bit). Also, have you tried just running rosdep install ogre. It looks like rosdep does have an entry for Fedora for nvidia-cg, so that would probably be your best bet for getting a compatible version of nvidia-cg.

I'm not sure what the rosdep for nvidia-cg is supposed to refer to, but yum doesn't know anything about Cg. Removing and reinstalling the rpm from nvidia seems to have resolved the problem.
