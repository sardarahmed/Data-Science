Q:

Can RTI Connext Open Community Source (OCS) be used?

When I applied for, recieved, and installed the OCS distribution of RTI Connext. I was not able to run with it.
F:\dev\ros2bouncybin
$ local_setup.bat
[connext_cmake_module] Error: The expected location of the Connext environment setup script [[C:\Program Files\rti_connext_dds-5.3.1\resource\scripts\rtisetenv_x64Win64VS2017.bat]] does not exist. Support for Connext will not be available.

Is this supposed to be supported?
FIles that exist in C:\Program Files\rti_connext_dds-5.3.1\resource\scripts:

rticommon.bat
rticommon_config.bat

A:

It looks like that you have only run a "host" installer but not any "target" bundle. You might want to double check to install at least one target bundle - e.g. something like "target-x64Win64VS2017.rtipkg".
And yes, you should be able to use the Connext OCS license - at the end of the day the code / API is the same and is only shipped under a different license (and potentially less functionality / tools).
