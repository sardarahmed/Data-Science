Q:

Plume Sim in ROS

I have used plume sim in Player/Stage - now I want to use it in ROS. However, I am not able to get much of a clue about installing it and using it.

A:

The documentation:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/plumesim
points you at the repository for the ROS version of plumesim:
http://isr-uc-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/unstable/simulator_plumesim/plumesim

Both of these link are broken now.  Are there any updated repositories or wiki pages?

Apparently jmerdich/isr-uc-ros-pkg/stacks/simulator_plumesim is a googlecode export of the package mentioned by @tfoote. Can't comment on its state though, and appears to be a rosbuild pkg still.

I am fairly new to ROS, so I am sorry if this is a dumb question, but would I be able to use this package on ROS indigo or jade if it is a rosbuild pkg?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-04-06:
rosbuild pkgs can be build on recent ROS releases, yes. But it could very well be that the code itself does no longer compile on Indigo or Jade.
