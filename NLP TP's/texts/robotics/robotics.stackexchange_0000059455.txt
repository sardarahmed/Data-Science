Q:

SBPL Lattice planner goal problem

Sometimes, when I set goal for the robot, the robot goes to the goal, but when it comes to goal, it is turning around himself (going in circle around himself). I suppose the problem is the resolution of error. How and where can i change that?

A:

Hi, If you fill that's the issue then, you can increase the value of goal tolerance in this file
navigation_experimental / sbpl_lattice_planner / launch / move_base / base_local_planner_params_close.yaml
Also try changing other parameters: This tutorial will help.
