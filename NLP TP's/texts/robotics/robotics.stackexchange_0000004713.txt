Q:

Rotate (and stop) a large disk in very tiny increments

In a lab build I'm doing, I'm stuck at this problem, so I am fishing for suggestions.
I'm creating a turn-table type setup where I need to make readings (with a nanotube-tip probe I've already designed, similar to an AFM probe) on the very edge/circumference of a 10 cm radius disk (substrate).
The current hurdle is: I need to get the substrate disk to move circularly in steps of 0.1 mm displacement -- meaning, I occasionally need to STOP at certain 0.1mm-increment positions.
What would be a way I can achieve this, assuming an accurate feedback system (with accuracy of say ~0.1 mm, e.g., with quadrature optical encoders) is available if needed for closed-loop control?
Specs of commonly sold steppers don't seem to allow this kind of control. I'm at the moment trying to study how, e.g. hard disks achieve extreme accuracies (granted they don't have such large disks).
Certainly, direct-drive like I'm currently building (see below image) probably doesn't help!

A:

You can use stepper motors easily:
Given the 20cm diameter, this is around 63cm circumfence. Your target stepsize is around 0,1mm. This means the motor should do around 6300 steps per revolution.
If you take a common stepper motor, which has a step size of around 1,8Â° per step. So the motor performs 200steps/per revolution. your target is 6300. 
Now we know the motor should have (6300/200) around 32times more accuracy.
So you have 2 different options: 
1. Use a gearbox with minimum ratio of 1:32
 Advantage: Still lot of force 
Disadvantage: It is pretty slow
2 Use some Stepper magic and let him microstepping. There are drivers with around 128 times microstepping.
 advantage: Still decent velocity
 disadvante: looses most of this force.
You could also combine this two methods... This is no problem at all.
