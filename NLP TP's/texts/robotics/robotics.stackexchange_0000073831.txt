Q:

how to get the ground truth map from ORB_SLAM

Hi,
I want to get the  map scale form the map which is build by ORB_slam2. Example,  there are two camera center kp1(x1-coordinate,y2-coordinate) ,   kp2(x2-coordinate,y2-coordinate), then i will know the distance between kp1 and kp2( in coordinate). But what's the real distance(m)(in the real word)?  i think i need to get the scale between coordinate and meter.  But i don't know where is the map scale in the ORB_slam2 code(now  I am a rookie ...). Could you tell me how to get the real map?? thank you very much!!

A:

Are you using Monocular, RGBD or Stereo algorithm?
ORBslam2 comes with the three approaches implemented. From a theoretical point of view, if you are using monocular approach, the map that you will obtain is not metric.

Is that mean that i couldn't get the distance(m) if using monocular approach? What about the stereo algorithm??
