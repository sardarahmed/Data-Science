Q:

Rviz: Is it possible to overlay images on top of the camera's image?

Lets say my camera is subscribed to a topic that produces raw images and display through rviz's camera, I want to have a second node produce some images and then overlay on top of the camera's images then display.
Is this possible in ROS? I'm new to ROS too. Any answers will be very much appreciated.

What is "rviz's camera" exactly? Are you referring to the Camera display, the Image display, or something else?

I'm referring to the Camera display. Thanks

A:

I'm not aware of any way to make the Camera display do what you want. It only takes in a single Image topic (together with a CameraInfo one).
You could perhaps place the images produced by the "second node" somewhere in RViz's 3D scene (and in the viewport of the Camera display). See #q227304 for a plugin that can do that.
Alternatively, you could perhaps merge / overlay / blend the image(s) (streams) first, publish the result and then subscribe the Camera display to that.
