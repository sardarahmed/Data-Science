Q:

error processing catkin package gt_gui_cpp

Hello, I am trying to build the catkin workspace on fedora 23 . I am following instructions given here
Installation/Source-ROS Wiki. Under the section 2.1.3 Building the Catkin Workspace, for the command-

$
./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated
--install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

My command line session shows the following :

== Finished processing package [79 of 228]: 'pluginlib'

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/tshrotriya/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/qt_gui_cpp
&&
/home/tshrotriya/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh
make -j4 -l4
Command failed, exiting.

I am not able to understand the next thing to do, I tried

$ cd /home/tshrotriya/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/qt_gui_cpp
&&
/home/tshrotriya/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh
make -j4 -l4

But that didn't do much either.Please help.

A:

The reason for this error is, as mentioned in the error message, is missing file. Actually it cannot find qmake.
If you try executing qmake from command line it will not find this command.
Check what qmake varians you have by tab-completing it in the command line. Personally i had qmake-qt4 and qmake-qt5. Here I assume, that since you got this far in the build process, you have all required qt5 packages installed.
To fix this issue:

Find location of the qmake-qt5 by running the command which qmake-qt5 (in my case it was /usr/bin/qmake-qt5)
Run command sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/qmake qmake /usr/bin/qmake-qt5 1 (substitute path to qmake-qt5 with yours from previous step)
