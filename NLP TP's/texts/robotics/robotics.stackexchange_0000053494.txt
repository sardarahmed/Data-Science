Q:

is there a changelog server for ros.org package repositories?

I'd like to be able to browse Ubuntu ROS package changelogs using the apt-get changelog command. For this a "changelog server" needs to be setup along the packge repositories. See apt-get(1) for detail.
Is such a server available for ros.org Ubuntu package repositories ?

A:

There is not.  We'd like to have one, however we have not found any standard tools to setup and create it. If you know of a toolchain to set one up please open a ticket on https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm with more information.
