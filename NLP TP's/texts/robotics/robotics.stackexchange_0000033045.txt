Q:

List of available cameras and drivers in ROS

Hi there,
I am preparing a tutorial on image processing in ROS and would thus like to present a list of currently available cameras and associated drivers in ROS. I am aware of the camera_drivers stack (http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_drivers) which supports some of the FireWire and GE cameras. Recently there has been an initiative to plug in a driver for usb cameras which will mostly likely be based off the uvc_camers driver (http://www.ros.org/wiki/uvc_camera). The discussion on the latter is available here: http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/call-for-an-official-ROS-USB-camera-package-td2116581.html.
Additionally we also have a driver for Kinect (http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_camera) and SR (http://www.ros.org/wiki/swissranger_camera).
Does anyone have more information and maybe a list of cameras that work with the above mentioned drivers?
Many thx in advance, D.
