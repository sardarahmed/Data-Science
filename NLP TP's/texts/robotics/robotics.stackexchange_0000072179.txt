Q:

teb local planner

Hi all,
Following my other question link: here , I am now trying to install teb_local_planner on ROS Hydro from source.
I am not sure on how to install packages from source so I have been following the answer to this question link:here.
However, I am getting the following errors:
powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~$ rosinstall ~/ros /opt/ros/hydro
rosinstall operating on /home/powerbot67/ros from specifications in rosinstall files  /opt/ros/hydro
(Over-)Writing /home/powerbot67/ros/.rosinstall
(Over-)Writing setup.sh, setup.bash, and setup.zsh in /home/powerbot67/ros

rosinstall update complete.

Now, type source /home/powerbot67/ros/setup.bash to
set up your environment. Add that to
the bottom of your ~/.bashrc to set
it up every time.
If you are not using bash please see
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosinstall/NonBashShells

powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~$ echo "source ~/ros/setup.bash">> ~/.bashrc
powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~$ roslocate info teb_local_planner > teb_local_planner.rosinstall
Using ROS_DISTRO: hydro
rosinstall ~/ros teb_local_planner.rosinstall
    cannot locate information about teb_local_planner

powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~$ rosinstall ~/ros teb_local_planner.rosinstall
rosinstall operating on /home/powerbot67/ros from specifications in rosinstall files  teb_local_planner.rosinstall
(Over-)Writing /home/powerbot67/ros/.rosinstall
    (Over-)Writing setup.sh, setup.bash, and setup.zsh in /home/powerbot67/ros

rosinstall update complete.

Is this the correct way to install teb_local_planner from source on Hydro? Or does this mean that teb_local_planner cannot be installed on Hydro?
Thanks always.
Update: Tried installing teb_local_planner from source as suggested by @gvdhoorn but I am getting the following errors:
powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~/catkin_ws/src$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro=hydro

It would be much simpler if you use catkin tool. I think that catkin is default since Hydro.

A:

No.
Quickly:
# create a catkin workspace somewhere (if you already have one, skip this)
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

# get a copy of teb_local_planner
git clone https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/teb_local_planner.git

# make sure we have all prerequisites
# NOTE: this step may fail
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro=hydro

# now build
# NOTE: this step may fail
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

If that is successful (no errors) then it may/should work. Source the setup.bash of the workspace (source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash) and use teb_local_planner as you would as if it had been installed using apt-get.

Edit:

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved to system dependencies:

The problem is that costmap_converter is also not released into Hydro (see wiki/costmap_converter). You'll have to try and see whether you can build that from source on Hydro as well. Just place the package in the same workspace as where you have teb_local_planner. But again: no guarantees that this will work.

I will try it out. Thanks once again.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2016-02-20:
Just curious btw: do you have any particular reason to use Hydro? It's been EOL for some time now, and (fi) teb_local_planner would be trivial to install on newer ROS versions (a simple apt-get install ..).

I am using ROS as part of a project to fulfill the requirements to obtain my degree in Engineering. My project builds upon work done by past students which was all done using ROS Hydro. If I update the ROS version, I'll have to repeat all past work, no?

It depends: if they didn't use anything that was specific to Hydro, then updating to Indigo would probably not be too much work. I can't guarantee anything, but you could at least try to compile 'past work' on Indigo.

(2/2) Most Hydro packages work pretty well on Indigo. But I can't make the decision for you, you'll have to decide for yourself whether the amount of work to check if things work on Indigo + any potential work upgrading pkgs that don't work <= struggling with Hydro.

(1/2) Considering that I don't have much time left and that the main aim is to get the robot to autonomously navigate a known map in a populated environment, I think it's better to keep using Hydro. I have noticed that eband_local_planner is similar and has documentation for Hydro.
