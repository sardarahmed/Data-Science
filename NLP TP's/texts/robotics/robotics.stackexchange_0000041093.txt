May I know how many bit is your raspberry pie? 8 or 16?

A:

Yes, ROS runs on ARM-based systems in principle, even if you have to do quite a bit more manual installation/configuration stuff compared to the package-based install on Ubuntu.
For the Raspberry Pi see this Q/A and this tutorial website that came out of it.
