Q:

Why run catkin_init_workspace inside src folder?

I don't unstand why we run catkin_init_workspace inside the src folder, shoudn't it be the root folder, which is the catkin workspace folder?
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace

A:

You don't need to run catkin_init_workspace yourself. catkin_make will take care of that for you automatically.

Are there any differences between one to the other? I've always wondered.
