Q:

roscore not working, ImportError: No module named RosStreamHandler

I installed ROS-Fuerte on Linux 12.04 and I am getting an error when I try to run roscore.
j@instadmin-HP-Z210-Workstation:/opt/ros/fuerte$ roscore

When I run roswtf I get:

ROS Master does not appear to be running.
Online graph checks will not be run.
ROS_MASTER_URI is [http://localhost:11311]

Any suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks!

A:

I encountered a similar problem once. Check the path via echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. You have to change the path via export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=  .... . Your path might have wrong directories or the path might consist of a symbolic link which is too complex for it to handle.
