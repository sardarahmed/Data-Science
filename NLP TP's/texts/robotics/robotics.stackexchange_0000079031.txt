Q:

Failed converting xacro to urdf

When I run the command rosrun xacro xacro.py ur5.urdf.xacro > ur5.urdf, the result is not as good as I expected.

 xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro">

Could I please ask you to not cross-post questions like these to both ROS Answers and the package's issue tracker (universal_robot#288)? Besides bad etiquette, it leads to duplication of effort and reduced visibility of solutions.

Thanks for your kind remainder. I published this issue here firstly, then I think Universal_robot is the more suitable category, so I pulbished a second time. Sorry for my mistake and I will pay attention to your advice. Thanks.

A:

Maybe try the ur5_robot.urdf.xacro file instead because I think that ur5.urdf.xacro just defines the macro, and the ur5_robot.urdf.xacro uses the macro here: https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/blob/1c07a163c5b649fb94b5c814945a01e3c506b647/ur_description/urdf/ur5_robot.urdf.xacro#L12

This is indeed the cause. ur5.urdf.xacro is not a top-level xacro, but only defines a macro. The ur5_robot.urdf.xacro is the one instantiating the model, and should those be used.
See also universal_robot#288.

Thank you for your help, it works now. That is indeed the cause.
