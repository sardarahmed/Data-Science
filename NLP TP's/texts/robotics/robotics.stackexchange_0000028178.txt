Q:

model set to be fixed to world keeps jittering

Background:
I want to set one of the box object to be fixed to the world.
What I have tried:
if an object set to be fixed to the world, it will keeps jittering. According to my search, some say it could be inertia problem. Though I change it according to formula of uniform 3d object, and it still doesn't work
Source code:
Here is the wall.xacro // script I show has commented the below code
Code below used to make box object fixed to world.
<!-- wall fixed to the world-->
    <link name="world"/>
    
    <joint name="base_link_fixed" type="fixed">
      <parent link="world"/>
      <child link="wall_link"/>
    </joint>

Problem:
However, the box turns out to be jittering all the time like dancing!!

A:

There are two solutions:

Add the static tag to your model
<static>1</static>

Add a valid inertial block to your model including correct mass and inertia matrix.
