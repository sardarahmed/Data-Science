Q:

ROS 2 (Foxy Fitzroy) Compatibility with Ubuntu 21.10

Will ros2 (Foxy Fitzroy) work on the latest version of Ubuntu (currently 21.10)? If not, will it be supported in the future? Should I install Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04) instead?

A:

It will not be "made available" in any other distributions than those it was released under, but you may always build it manually, but you won't have access to binaries to install / support. I would recommend 20.04. 21.10 is not an LTS Ubuntu distro, unless there's something very particular that requires it.
But you can always use Docker to install and work with ROS 2 Foxy on 21.10.
