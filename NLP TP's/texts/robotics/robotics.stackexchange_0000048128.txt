Q:

raspberry rosdep initialised, but still asking to initialise

Hi
Trying to install ros desktop on raspberry pi.
I am at the resolving dependencies point and the command
sudo rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y
fails with ERROR: your rosdep installation has not been initialized yet. Please run: rosdep update
rosupdate runs fine, but the error still happens. Tried running rosdep init again, but get
ERROR: default sources list file already exists:Please delete if you want to re-initialize
tried deleting and re-initializing, but still getting the same error

Hi,
I got this to work by running sudo rosdep update.  Give it a try.

You should not run rosdep update as root since it creates the database in your user home with root ownership.

Without root access , I was not able to update the database.  Is there any reason it cannot be done without root access?
