Q:

Getting 11.0 as output data for all the scans when using pointcloud_to_laserscan node

I have a bunch of pointcloud which i need to convert to laserscan. The data i have are in pointcloud and cannot be used directly. So i converted them to pointcloud2 using the point_cloud_converter and fed the pointcloud2 data to the CloudTOScan Nodelet. However the resulting published data is 11.0 for all the scans which corresponds to range_max + 1.0. I tried verifying the input data. Both the pointcloud and the converted pointcloud2 data can be viewed correctly in rviz. Any idea on what might be causing the issue?

A:

Seems like it's because the pointclouds i have are assembled from a tilting laser scanner instead of a kinect camera. Therefore the direction conventions are different. I edited the direction conventions in the pointcloud_to_laserscan node and the laserscan are now published correctly.

I think to have the same problem.  where do you change direction conventions in pointcloud node ?
