Q:

Keyboard teleoperation for the SimulatingOneRobot tutorial on ROS Hydro

Hi,
I want to know which package I can use to teleoperate with a keyboard the stageros? because in the tutorial
http://wiki.ros.org/stage/Tutorials/SimulatingOneRobot
they told you to use teleop_base which is depracted and it is for the stacks
http://answers.ros.org/question/9207/teleop_base-deprecated-need-generic-teleop-package/#
and the other versions around are for the stacks and not for catkin
http://answers.ros.org/question/54078/stage-simulatingonerobot-tutorial-is-there-still-a-teleop_base-package/
I also wonder if the packages that are based on the stacks can be used with catkin? and I can do the following:

I've also opened a ticket indicating that the tutorial you're using needs to be updated: https://github.com/rtv/Stage/issues/50
