Q:

can I use rosserial mbed library without using mbed os?

Hi everyone,
I am using rosserial mbed with online compiler. It is fine for now but I want to use my STM32F767 nucleo board more efficiently. I am wondering that is it possible to use offline compiler and mbed rosserial library without using mbed os?
It looks like rosrun rosserial_mbed make_libraries.py <ros-lib-dir> creates header files for board and only MbedHardware.h directly related with mbed.
I'm not an expert on microcontroller, so I am just wondering can I simply use rosserials make_library.py command and use generated ros message headers on my code?

If you don't plan to use mbed, could you not use any of the other targets that rosserial supports?

I just realise that I do not needrosserial_mbed, rosrun rosserial_clint make_libraries.py  does the same job. So can I use that libraries with ARM cmsis RTOS or freeRTOS?

mbed is actually the ARM cmsis RTOS.  That is what is inside.  If you need better performance use the command line compiler.There you can set the target for "deploy" and it removes the debug code and allows optimizations that would make debugging hard,

A:

Yes, you only have to add a class for your hardware that implement the methods read(), write() and time(), then include it and call the constructor in the ros.h file.
You can use some implementations as examples:

rosserial_mbed
rosserial_arduino
rosserial_chibios
