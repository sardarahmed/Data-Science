Q:

Turtlebot not spawning in Gazebo

Hi
I just installed ros kinetic, gazebo and turtlebot in Ubuntu 16.04. when i run
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

in terminal gazebo opens with the standard obstacles but there is no bot.
I installed gazebo with apt-get.
this is the error i get i terminal:
[spawn_turtlebot_model-4] process has died [pid 11263, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/gazebo_ros/spawn_model -unpause -urdf -param robot_description -model mobile_base __name:=spawn_turtlebot_model __log:=/home/andreas/.ros/log/d859e7e6-659c-11e7-bff4-a402b924af68/spawn_turtlebot_model-4.log].
log file: /home/andreas/.ros/log/d859e7e6-659c-11e7-bff4-a402b924af68/spawn_turtlebot_model-4*.log

Any help appreciated!

Edit: This is what terminal is showing when i run roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch.
Still no bot showing:

Please provide more information on how to reproduce your problem. As well as the full console logs of what you're doing, not just the one line error. http://wiki.ros.org/Support

The problem is that i dont find a bot when i run "roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch" in terminal. Gazebo opens and there are objects like cylinder, jersy barrier, bookshelf an so on showing in the map/world. This happens everytime I run the command. Is it not supposed to show up?

And where do I find that log?

Thanks.

A:

I found a solution. There was a problem with having Anaconda2 installed. Since I dont need Anaconda I deleted it along with the content of catkin_ws. I ran the installation steps again and it worked.
