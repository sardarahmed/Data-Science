Q:

Can not run commands on my ROS directory

On my ros folder i have tried to do:
a@s:/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros$ git pull
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
a@s:/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros$ catkin_make
Base path: /opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros
The specified source space "/opt/ros/indigo/etc/ros/src" does not exist
Does anyone knows why i got this errors?
Thanks

A:

Entering these commands does not make sense. You seem to be working with a system install of ROS. This should already work without doing anything to it. What are you trying to achieve?
Both commands are issued in a directory that is neither a repository nor a ROS package.
