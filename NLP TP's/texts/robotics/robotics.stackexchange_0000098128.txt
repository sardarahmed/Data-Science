Q:

Autoware Auto - Base docker image build

Hello,
I have recently started working on Autoware Auto opensource code. And I am having trouble understanding how the Base docker image is built.
As per the given documentation, we directly download the executable from [here]($ wget https://gitlab.com/ApexAI/ade-cli/uploads/f6c47dc34cffbe90ca197e00098bdd3f/ade+x86_64).
I am interested know which dockerfile is being used to build the base docker image and also the where exactly the build process starts.
Kindly excuse if the question is too basic.
Thank you, 
KK

A:

The docker images are built during a job on gitlab. You can have a look at the gitlab-ci file here.
Have a look at the lines 24 and 36 for the docker build commands.
The docker files used for the build are located in the AutowareAuto/tools/ade_image
 directory in the repo.
Also you can have a look at the container registry to see the built docker images.
