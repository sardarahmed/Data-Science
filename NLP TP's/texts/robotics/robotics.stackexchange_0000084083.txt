Q:

Motoman FS100: Missing velocity and effort in joint_states

I'm controlling Yaskawa Motoman  SIA10F (controller: FS100) over ROS.  Previously the /joint_states topic had values of velocity and effort as well as position, but now velocity and effort disappeared (just blank vectors are sent).  I removed some newly-installed packages, but they are still blank.  Can anyone have ideas to fix this issue?
What I am doing to launch the Motoman system is as follows:
$ roscore
$ rosparam load `rospack find motoman_sia10f_support`/urdf/sia10f.urdf robot_description
$ rosparam set controller_joint_names "[joint_s, joint_l, joint_e, joint_u, joint_r, joint_b, joint_t]"
$ roslaunch motoman_driver robot_interface_streaming_fs100.launch robot_ip:=192.168.12.31
$ rostopic echo /joint_states

What do you mean by 'now' ?
Did you do something in your system, like upgrading the packages?

I believe you are mistaken, because if you are using the motoman_driver (which, from the commands you show, I believe you are) then velocity and effort were never published as part of the JointState msgs by the robot_state publisher. Those are simply not being populated by the current version of the driver.
See also ros-industrial/motoman#174, where this is being tracked and discussed.

Mmm it could be my mistake.  What I'm sure is that I saw a "response" of robot for pushing it.  I thought the response was effort, but it could be a slight change of joint positions.  You should be right as I am using the pure motoman_driver.  Thanks so much.
