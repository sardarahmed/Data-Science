Q:

Can we convert a .sdf file to .urdf. I need to use the file in MoveIt. But it accepts only .urdf files

Any other method regarding how I can use my .sdf file in MoveIt will also be welcome.

A:

No we can't. Have a look at link
I think the only way is to start with URDF and convert it to SDF.
Some additional Info that might be useful

Gazebo will continue to support URDF info.
Also, xacro helps you to systematically develop your robot using macros, which I think is not there in SDF. So, it is not a bad idea that you start with URDF
