Q:

rotated image in rviz when using kinect

Hi
While using kinect and viewing image I'm getting 90 degree rotated image. What I'm saying is instead of top to bottom, rviz shows left side of image on top and right part of image as bottom so it looks lik its rotated 90degree.
what shld i do to get to usual image?

A:

Hi,
Just change the tf frame in the Fixed frame of rviz. It should work. If it doesn't please post the image here.
Hope it helps,
Karthik

could you set the background to black and add Grid in the rviz for the pointcloud image and send the screenshot again
Comment by karthik on 2012-05-02:
please add tf also to the rviz so that the tf frames are seen in the display
