Q:

Does roslaunch support topic remapping from command line?

Hi all,
The roslaunch page says that we can remap topic by simply adding this line to launch file.
<remap from="chatter" to="hello"/>

I want to ask if we can do the same thing in command line?
roslaunch <package name> <launch file name> chatter:=hello

Thanks~

A:

I'm not sure, if roslaunch supports that - just try it.
If it doesn't, you can use args for that:
<arg name="from_topic" />
<remap from="from_topic" to="$(arg from_topic)"/>

Command line syntax should stay the same.

Defining an arg is probably the best solution available.

I tried but it doesn't work,  so I want to make sure if it was my problem or roslaunch doesn't support this function.

I don't understand "Command line syntax should stay the same.". What does command line syntax look like?
Isn't it roslaunch [package name] [launch file name] chatter:=hello?

That would be the syntax. But, in Christian's arg example: substitute "chatter" for "from_topic". His answer was more generic.

I meant that the command line remapping looks exactly the same as when remapping topics, although the underlying functionality (using args) is different.

Thanks for your help~

This example could be easier to understand if the arg name was 'to_topic'.
