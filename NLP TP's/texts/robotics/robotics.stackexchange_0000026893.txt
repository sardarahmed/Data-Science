Q:

Setting joint velocity from a plugin

Hello all,
I'm trying to simulating an obstacle avoiding robot in gazebo. I've been following this tutorial.
The problem is that this tutorial uses in order to move the robot.

SetForce(0, torque);

The problem with that is it eventually makes robot to spin.
So i looked in API ref and found

SetVelocity(0, vel);

Code compiles just fine however, this doesn't seem to have any effect on model.
So how can I set velocity of wheels from a plugin ?

A:

You also need to call SetMaxForce(0, max_allowed_force)
The max_allowed_force is the maximum force Gazebo will apply in order to achieve the desired velocity.

Ty mate ! However, I still wonder about why SetVelocity is not working though.
