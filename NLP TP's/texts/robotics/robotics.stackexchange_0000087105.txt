Q:

Removing the roslaunch cache

The first time running roslaunch after a rebuild or after a reboot, etc, there is a noticeable delay while paths to executables are cached, etc, or at least that is what I presume happens.
On my system with about 120 packages, I have a startup timing bug that most often manifests itself when there is a slow roslaunch. Is there a file or directory to delete or a roslaunch parameter, etc that I can use to force roslaunch to start from a clean setting?

It seems that this answer is what my real issue is. Using the suggested vmtouch tool I can reproduce my problem.
