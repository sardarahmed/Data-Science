i just can publish mesage in my pc
i can't publish to other pc in LAN

A:

You need to set up a wifi access point and set that as the ros master.
You probably want to set this access point in your robot which has roscore running and connect to its network with your laptop.
More info on how to make a ros master here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup
EDIT

Figure out where roscore is running in. (It is probably in your robot)
Set up a single wireless network. (In your case if the robot has the roscore running you want to set up a wireless access point in the robot and connect to the wireless network with your computer)
Configure the Ros master URI so that you can see all of the ros topics in your computer: info here http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup (you need to edit the robot's .bashrc and your computers .bashrc according to the wiki)

I want to add: The position of the access point can be everywhere. Master and clients have to be in the same subnet only.
