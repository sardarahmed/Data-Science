Q:

ROS Master on android is throwing error while closing connection

I am running a public ROS master on an android phone and I am able to subscribe and publish to nodes (running on Android) side from PC.
It appears that whenever I close the existing connection (by pressing Ctrl+C) from the PC side. The ROS master running on android throws the following error
04-18 23:23:05.318 23100-23150/? E/XmlRpcErrorLogger: No such handler: system.multicall
org.apache.xmlrpc.server.XmlRpcNoSuchHandlerException: No such handler: system.multicall

    at org.apache.xmlrpc.util.ThreadPool$Poolable$1.run(ThreadPool.java:68)

Apart from this error, the master is also throwing `Connection refused' messages.

Also, I have observed a pattern. When publishing first time with rostopic pub /topic_name, the message goes through without error. Then if I break (Ctrl+C) and resend, the pub request is met with the above error (second code snippet) and then the message gets through.
Has anyone else faced such an error?
It appears to be a bug (it is not pointing to any of files created be me). Is this a serious issue and is there a fix for this?

A:

This is / was a known issue and should be fixed in the most recent binary packages / the next release.
See rosjava/android_core#236, fixed in rosjava/rosjava_core#273.

It would appear that at least #q205122 is a duplicate of this.

If I may suggest: use Google for these things, especially if you have such an explicit error message. Just copy-paste the error message and press search. Good chance you'll get some informative results. It's not that we don't want to help, but searching yourself will be much faster.

I just discovered the same post while browsing through questions tagged with android. I will try more searching next time.
