Q:

Why there is so much research going on in humanoid robots?

It seems like humanoid robots is the hottest field of research in robotics. Government agencies are giving huge sums of money to private firms and labs to develop them (For example, Boston Dynamics has developed some really amazing humanoid robots, and some of them look scary!).
My question is: The human body is highly inefficient. We can't run for very long times, have to learn for several months before we start walking, have only two hands, and are slow. Then why spend so much money and effort emulating such an inefficient thing? May be it is time that we took a step away from getting "inspired" by Nature, and build a man-made, highly efficient body. 
An example: Balancing a robot on two legs in very difficult. My question is, then why use some other method for locomotion, that is easier and more effective. A robot on two legs can run only so much faster. Why not come-up with some optimal shape, and then model your robots on it?

A:

From another point of view, bipeds(humanoids) are regardless of their use interesting since they are high dimensional nonlinear hybrid systems. Sure, there are more systems with those qualifications, but the special thing with bipeds is that we have a clear intuition of what is right and wrong even without any mathematical background. Furthermore, take a quadruped(4 legs), those robots are arguably more inherently stable, while with two legs, especially if you remove the feet, that is a different story. So in a way, those humanoids are perfect tools to center nonlinear control theory around.
I think you can cook up a similar argument from an AI point of view. However, I agree with you that for many practical problems a biped makes no sense.
