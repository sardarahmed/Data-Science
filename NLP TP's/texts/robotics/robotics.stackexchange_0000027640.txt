Q:

Problem with start controller with roslaunch: controller spawner couldn't find the expected controller_manager ROS interface

Hy everyone,
I'm using ros jade with gazebo 5.2.
I tried to follow  this tutorial. After launching the rrbot_world.launch, I try to do :
 roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch

I've this response

The WARN says that the spawner couldn't not found the controller manager.
I already have this command line  :
sudo apt-get install ros-jade-ros-control ros-jade-ros-controllers

What's wrong? Could it be a compatibility problem between my gazebo/ros distro?
Then I don't understand what is control_manager. Should it be a directory? Because in my rrbot_control I can't see it. Have I to create it?
Thank you, bye!

A:

Hello again :)
In this tutorial, section Install gazebo_ros_pkgs, it says that there is no ros-jade-gazebo-ros-control debian package released for now. Without this, you can't run simulations using ros_control in Gazebo.
What you can do now is clone the gazebo_ros_pkgs repository and compile the gazebo_ros_control package, so you can run your simulation.
