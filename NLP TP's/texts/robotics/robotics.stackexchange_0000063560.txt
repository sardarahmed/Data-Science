Q:

How to fix hydro ros in ubuntu12.04

Hi, all, I falsely tried to update boost to be libboost1.55-dev by using PPA as this link . This caused unexpected breakdowns. Firstly, many lines with "Removing ros-hydro-xxx, Removing ros-groovy-xxx" (My OS is with two versions of ROS) came out and couldn't be stopped by "ctril+ c". Finally, a red circle with a white line in the middle of it came up in the upper-right corner of desktop of Ubuntu. Then luckily I openned "Ubuntu Software Center" and it disappear the red circle by automatically repairing some missing packages. The reason is same to this question about boost in hydro.
However, when I want to compile some packages by catkin_make, it prompted that some fundamental packages couldn't be found such as std_msgs. So I have to repair the ros-hydro. I don't know how to do. Should I re-install hydro ros by the instruction for hydro installation from ROS tutorial with uninstallation?
I have tried to uninstall hydro ros by this link, but the terminal prompted

E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro

or

E: Unable to locate package hydro

Hopefully any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

A:

You will need to remove the conflicting packages which you installed (and caused the uninstallation of the ros packages) Once those are removed/downgraded to the older versions you will be able to install hydro the standard way.
