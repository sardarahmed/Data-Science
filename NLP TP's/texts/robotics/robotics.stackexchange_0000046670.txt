Q:

how to install turtlebot simulator in virtualbox?

Dear,
I just installed VirtualBox Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with ROS Fuerte. After that, I would like to install turtlebot simulator, but found that the tutorial is for electric version. I got stuck at the first step: Configure your Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse" but I cannot see any Software Sources or Software Center. Just wondering if turtlebot can run on Fuerte or not? Or is it the problem of VirtualBox and the LTS version? Thank you very much indeed for your help.
best regards,
David

This question has been answered by NooTriX. Using their OVA, configuration is not required. Just type:
sudo apt-get update
download and install all the updates, and then type
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-turtlebot-simulator
Simple!!!
