Q:

help with leg_detection

Hello,
I am working on leg_detection using this. I am using Ubuntu 14.04, ros-Indigo, with a turtlebot. whenever i run:

roslaunch leg_detector leg_detector.launch

I am getting the following error:

[ WARN] [1466630966.002926837]: MessageFilter [target=odom_combined ]: Dropped 100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the [ros.leg_detector.message_notifier] rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more information.

I did go through the old questions related to this error and changes my fixed_frame from:

odom_comined to odom

when i changed my fixed frame and ran:

rostopic echo /camera_tracker_measurements

it outputs nothing. can someone help me with this?
Thanks.
