Q:

Piloting Examples for Bebop Autonomy on Ubuntu 16

There were good examples for the take off, landing and emergency commands but no example of what the piloting commands should look like. I tried the same layouts as the take off line but these did not work.
eg. rostopic pub --once bebop/angular.z [1] geometry_msgs/Twist
Any examples of piloting commands would be greatly appreciated.

A:

I'm new in ROS but I found this on ROS wiki:
http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic
$ rostopic pub --once bebop/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear:  {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0,y: 0.0,z: 1.0}}'

I hope it helps.
