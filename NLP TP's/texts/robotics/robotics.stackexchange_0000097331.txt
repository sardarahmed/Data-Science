Q:

How to log in separate file per node

Hi community!
In the .ros/log/{cryptic_someting}/  folder I see some nodes create their own log files:
E.g.: controller_spawner-3.log or rqt_robot_steering-5.log
How can I achieve that for my own nodes? - Until now all my log messages are written in the roslaunch.log
Thanks in advance
Alex

A:

using ROS_INFO function to display the log message and you can do this by setting output="log" to a node in the launch file.

It worked thanks. Extra question: Do you know how to set it up that it logs to the separate file AND outputs to the screen?

Do you mean:   output="log"   ?
There is no 'display' parameter in node.

@alex_ I'm glad I could help you.
may be you can use the tee command.
If you want to have any further interaction, please do so on a separate question page.

@MadeleineP Thank you for pointing this out. You are right. I have reflected it.

@Miura, I have added  output="log"  to my launch file, and I receive all of my ROS_INFO messages in rosout.log.  A separate log file for my node is not being created.  However, several other nodes are logging to their own log files.  Is there something else I need to do?  Thanks.

@MadeleineP You are probably running into the behavior described in this question that also includes a link to an open bug report.

@MadeleineP The answer from miura san worked for me (Ubuntu 16.04) therefore I marked it as correct.
