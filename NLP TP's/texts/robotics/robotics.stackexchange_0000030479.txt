Q:

How can I get my cout output on the console with roslaunch

Why does only error output appear at the console when launching a ros node from roslaunch? Also, I can I force the normal behavior, so that I can see my cout output?
For example, I wrote this in a simple node:
ROS_INFO("ROS_INFO");
ROS_WARN("ROS_WARN");
ROS_ERROR("ROS_ERROR");
std::cout << "cout" << std::endl;
std::cerr << "cerr" << std::endl;

If I call rosrun myNode myNode, I see the five lines. If I call roslaunch myNodeLauncher, I see only ROS_ERROR and std::cerr.

A:

In your Roslaunch XML add the following within your node tags:
output="screen"

You can always change the debug-level from RXconsole, select the node and change the level (rxloggerlevel).
