Q:

publishing in rospy and subscribing in rosjava

Can my publisher in rospy and subscriber in rosjava be in two separate packages in the same workspace?I am new to ROS and there are different build commands for rospy like catkin_make and gradlew for rosjava. Can i use the same workspace for building both the scripts by putting them in two seperate packages or should i put them in the same package?

all:
   gradle
