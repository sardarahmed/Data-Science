Q:

rosdep resolve yaml-cpp not working for debian:wheezy

Running
rosdep resolve yaml-cpp --os=debian:wheezy
doesn't yield the libyaml-cpp-dev package as expected, and instead returns an empty #apt line.
Why does this happen? The base.yaml seems to contain the correct definition:
yaml-cpp:
  arch: yaml-cpp
  debian:
    apt:
      wheezy: libyaml-cpp-dev
      sid: libyaml-cpp-dev
    source: {md5sum: f7fb81fd4a2fbd5022daa7686e816359, uri: 'https://kforge.ros.org/rosrelease/viewvc/sourcedeps/yaml-cpp/yaml-cpp-0.2.5.rdmanifest'}

Should I open a ticket for this?

A:

That's probably something releated to https://github.com/ros/rosdep/issues/51 and https://github.com/ros/rosdep/issues/10

That was not the problem, the os is the correct one when given as an option.
However the syntax was wrong, the os version key should come before the package manager key.
For reference, the pull request with the fix: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/326
