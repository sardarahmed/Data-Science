A:

I don't know of any ROS specific OCR package. You can integrate with standard libraries. There is a speech recognition package pocketsphinx which is used regularly.

I found "cob_read_text" and "read_text" are the packages of OCR supported for electric, aren't these packages available for hydro and indigo?
