Q:

Updating package under eclipse

I have added another source file in my package and run some commands like in the answer in this link (by running "make clean; make eclipse-project command and restart Eclipse"). However, the working package is not updated under eclipse.
I know that it will work out of the box, if I again go through the import package procedure, but, it is tiring doing it every time I add some new files in the package.
Is there any elegant way of doing it?

@DimitriProsser: There is no error but second source file that I've just added in the package is not updated in eclipse project tree. I simply cannot see it. Am I missing something?

What are the errors that you're receiving?

A:

Click on the Eclipse project tree for your package and press F5. This will update the Eclipse package manager.

By the way, just for sharing, I've press F5 before but not clicking to the "Eclipse project tree for your package" prior to press it. Luckily, got an eclipse expert like you here.
