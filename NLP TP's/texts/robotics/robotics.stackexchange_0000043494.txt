How do I update OpenCV for ROS?
I have read that The ROS Electric currently using 2.3.
But I would like to try latest version.

A:

I removed ROS OpenCV package and installed the latest source.
May require some tweaking to your own code and to ld.
And if you are using the full distro (desktop or desktop-full) may not be possible.
This question also has other possibilities: creating an overlay (also check this tutorial although it's for catkin).
