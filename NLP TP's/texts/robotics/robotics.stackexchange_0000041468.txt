Q:

permission denied when creating custom msg in rosserial

rosrun rosserial_client make_library.py /usr/share/arduino/libraries encoders

I get the following error. But it did create Encoder.h in /usr/share/arduino/libraries/ros_lib/Encoder so I guess I'm ok?
Exporting to /usr/share/arduino/libraries/ros_lib

A:

You are not allowed to write to /usr/share/arduino/libraries, which is the output path you give to make library
Make the libraries to your arduino IDE sketch_book folder (e. g. ~/sketch_book) in your home dir:
cd  ~/sketch_book/libraries
rosrun rosserial_client make_library.py . encoders
