Q:

Suggestions for beginer in Robotics

I am beginner in Robotics.I want to make serious start from scratch with interest but confused from where to start.So can anyone give some suggestions for 1.As a beginner in robotics ,are there some simple and basic robots or circuit
designs which I can make by myself in the home(so that I can gain practical knowledge of robots)? 2.or should I first read books (can anyone suggest some good reference  book names,articles ,links,free on-line  video lecture series)?

A:

Great to know that you are interested in Robotics. To start with robotics you should have a bit knowledge on how to do simple programs in C and if you have knowledge on Electronics and Mechanical then it will really help you out in designing robot parts understand the circuit and all. 
For a beginner I would suggest you to check out Arduino Tutorials, since it is easy to learn and has a large user-base. You will need to buy many components for your robotic projects such as sensors, leds, wires, motors, camera, etc and it can sometimes be costly. Before buying any robotic parts from your nearby stores or other sites you should check the price of the same at these sites Adafruit Shop, Element14, Sparkfun, Robot Marketplace and Hobbyking , maybe you will find a better option there.
Alternatively you can also check these sites to learn Arduino : Adafruit, Ladyada, Sparkfun,Ray Wenderlich and Instructables. Once you are done learning Arduino you can then learn PIC Microcontroller and following that embedded boards such as Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black. By this time you will have good knowledge of how hardware and software works and you can then be able to dig into advances stuffs like Artificial intelligence and Autonomous bots.
