Q:

I have installed Gazebo 1-9 and there is some errors when it starts in Ubuntu 13.04 (raring)

Hi, i have Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring) and i have installed Gazebo 1-9 following the Gazebo's tutorials.
After that  i type on the terminal "gazebo" and the gui starts but have two errors and one Warning:
Warning [ModelDatabase.cc:206] Unable to connect to model database using [http://gazebosim.org/models//database.config]. Only locally installed models will be available.
Error [Param.cc:181] Unable to set value [1,0471975511965976] for key[horizontal_fov]
Error [Param.cc:181] Unable to set value [0,100000001] for key[near]
What have i to do?
Best regards

A:

It looks like a locale issue (error interpreting commas as decimal separators). Try setting LANG="C" or LANG="en_US"
The warning message about the model database has been fixed in gazebo 2.2. It could also indicate that you don't have an internet connection.

Try setting LANG="C" or LANG="en_US" ---> The error remains
"The warning message about the model database has been fixed in gazebo 2.2. It could also indicate that you don't have an internet connection." --->and now how can i install the model database with an internet connection? Thanks!

I still get this error in gazebo 3.0

Stefano, models will automatically download when you use them (either by loading an SDF file, or dragging them into a scene via the GUI). I'll setup a VM with a different language to debug this problem further.

I was unable to reproduce it using spanish (es_ES) locales for LC_ALL and LANG. Andrei, could please the output of printenv command and the error message you see in gazebo 3.0? Thanks.

I copied printenv here http://pastebin.com/7aEGm8dQ and the gazebo error is Error [Param.cc:181] Unable to set value [1,0471975511965976] for key[horizontal_fov] Error [Param.cc:181] Unable to set value [0,100000001] for key[near]

Is it a fedora system? I'm suspecting from LC_NUMERIC. Could you please test: LC_NUMERIC=C LC_COLLATE=C gazebo?
Comment by AndreiHaidu on 2014-05-05:
it's ubuntu 13.04, LC_NUMERIC=C did the job, does this actually influence gazebo during runtime?
Comment by Jose Luis Rivero on 2014-05-05:
Indeed. It does affect (not only) all kind of input/output operations that uses . Reference could be found: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clocale/. Could you please submit an issue in sdformat about this? We can patch it to overwrite user locales.

There doesn't seem to be a maintainer for libsdformat1, so reporting a bug is not allowed...
Comment by Jose Luis Rivero on 2014-07-22:
Ummm, we are maintaining and support sdformat 1.4 branch and 2.0 branch. Where did you read that there is no maintainer for libsdformat1?

Just to let others now that the issue is reported here: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/sdformat/issue/60/error-when-starting-gazebo-if-lc_numeric
