Q:

amcl package not on ROS Noetic

Hi,
I recently installed ROS Noetic from this link on Ubuntu 20.04, and was planning on using the amcl package for localization applications.
It seems that the amcl package is not located in the shared packages folder that belongs to ROS Noetic, although it says that the latest navigation stack should be on Noetic. Is there a way for me to include the package on this distribution although it natively does not come with it?
Thank you

Did you sudo apt install ros-noetic-amcl?
