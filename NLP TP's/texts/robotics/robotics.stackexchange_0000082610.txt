Q:

robot_localization: How are the sensor measurements being fused?

I was working with the robot_localization package for fusing encoder/IMU/GPS measurements. I wanted to know does the filter fuse the measurements in time? Is it a loosely-coupled fusion? It would be helpful if someone can explain the underlying algorithm for taking in the measurements for correction.

ROS Answers has a lot of earlier questions about robot_localization. Have you tried taking a look at those and see whether they answer your questions? Using Google works best. Add site:answers.ros.org to your query text.

A:

Take a look at the documentation. That has a global overview of how things work, a link to the ROSCon15 talk by Tom and a reference to a paper describing the component.

Thanks. I actually wanted some clarity/confirmation whether any sort of coupling happens between the measurements and their covariances before they are used for correction in the filter?
