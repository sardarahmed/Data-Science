Q:

moveit change pick pipeline

Hi,
I would like to know if it is possible to change the pipeline for the pick action (I'm working with ROS Melodic)
I need to customise the "post_grasp_retreat" stage to execute something like a trajectory instead of a linear movement.
Is there an "easy" way to change only this section of the pipeline, or I need to rewrite the whole action?
Thanks,
Germ√°n

A:

Of course you can change the stage if you edit the sources...
The much more general approach by some of us Maintainers is the MoveIt Task Constructor framework which is designed for users to implement their own stages.
