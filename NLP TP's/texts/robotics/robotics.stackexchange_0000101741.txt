Q:

ROS2 plan a trajectory without mapping (without lidar)

Hello, first of all, for a little bit of context, i'm using ros2 foxy with ubuntu 20.04 and gazebo 11.
I'm still learning how everything works together so, if i'm saying something wrong, i would really appreciate to be corrected !
I have a robot defined within a urdf file, with plugins to work properly in gazebo. My robot spawn correctly, i can control it with teleop_twist_keyboard and the /tf odom -> base_link and base_link -> [other parts of my robot] are published correctly.
As odometry sources I am using differential drive encoder and an absolute location plugin in gazebo (gazebo_ros_p3d) and I have an IMU.
My robot spawn in a gazebo world that is just a planar ground with no obstacles
Now I just want to be able to say to my robot something like "go to x=10 and y=12" in an empty map, I don't need to map my environment (as i believe it will be hard with my available sensors anyway).
The problem I am facing is that in tutorial like https://navigation.ros.org/setup_guides/sensors/setup_sensors.html they tends to use lidars which i can't use.
From what i understood I have to publish the map -> Odom transform in order to go further but everything i found used lidars to publish it.
Now if anyone could give me some hints in where to look at, that would be wonderful !
On a side note, my robot have a trailer (for now i'm doing as if it wasn't here) but if you happens to have some documentation on path planning with a trailer I would greatly appreciate !
Thank you anyone who took the time to ream me, if you want me to add anything just tell me !
Would you have a tutorial I could follow with

A:

The map->odom is responsible for compensating for sensor drift, and also for locating the robot starting location in a map. If you have no drift and do not care about absolute coordinates, feel free to provide a static identity transform between map and odom (ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 map odom).
