<== Failed to process package 'cartographer': 
  Command '/home/exbot/cartographer/install_isolated/env.sh ninja -j4 -l4' returned non-zero exit status 1

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/exbot/cartographer/build_isolated/cartographer && /home/exbot/cartographer/install_isolated/env.sh ninja -j4 -l4

Command failed, exiting.

i have rebuilt many times but the errors are still have.My ROS is indigo,ubuntu 14.04 x86.But I have succeed to build cartographer in the other computer which has ROS indigo ,ubuntu 14.04 x64.plz help!

I think this is specific enough to be solved by the Cartographer devs themselves. I recommend you report this to cartographer_ros/issues. Please report back if/when you resolve this.
Comment by yueweiliang on 2016-10-11:
I have get the reply from github that X86 is unsopported.But they also say that the errors may not be caused by X86 or X64.I decided to change to X64 to solve it ........

Could you provide a link to the github issue that you reported?

A:

Resolved here: https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer/issues/42
