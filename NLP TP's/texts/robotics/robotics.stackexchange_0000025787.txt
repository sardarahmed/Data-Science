Q:

Cannot connect to Connection Manager

Hello,
I have followed the installation guide here: http://gazebosim.org/wiki/1.4/install and installed Gazebo using the pre-compiled binaries for Ubuntu Linux 12.04 (precise). However, when I execute the following command:
bram@bram-progbak:~$ gazebo

I get the following output:
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 1.4.0
Copyright (C) 2013 Open Source Robotics Foundation.
Released under the Apache 2 License.

Msg Waiting for master.Msg Waiting for master...................................................................................................

And the dots go on forever. When I hit CTRL-C the following messages is displayed:
Error [ConnectionManager.cc:89] Connection Manager is not running
I have also tried to use the Gazebo package which is integrated with ROS but the same happens there. The following environmental variables have been defined:
GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11345

GAZEBO_MODEL_DATABASE_URI=http://gazebosim.org/models

GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/gazebo-1.4/plugins

GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-1.4:/usr/share/gazebo_models

Here is the tracelog when I try to run gzmaster:
bram@bram-progbak:~/builds/gazebo-1.4.0/build$ gdb gzmaster

Hope you guys can help me get the master server to run. Thanks!

Yes, I'm having the same problem.
Comment by Morloth on 2013-02-05:
It seems that the problem is that when I run gzmaster it segfaults. (updated original post).
Comment by Morloth on 2013-02-05:
Just installed version Gazebo 1.3 which does work. So I'm not sure what the problem is with version 1.4.

Here you go, hope it helps.

The short-term solution is to remove "localhost" from the "::1" line. I'm working on a patch to gazebo now.

Great! That worked, thank you very much.
