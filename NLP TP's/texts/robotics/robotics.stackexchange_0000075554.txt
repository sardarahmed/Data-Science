Q:

Fail: ABORTED: No motion plan found. No execution attempted

I have used moveit api but with function "group.setPoseTarget(pose1)" it give " Fail: ABORTED: No motion plan found. No execution attempted" and at terminal of rviz it give
[ INFO] [1469775045.492605776]: LBKPIECE1: Created 1 (1 start + 0 goal) states in 1 cells (1 start (1 on boundary) + 0 goal (0 on boundary))

can any one tell me how to solve this problem?

Have you solved it?

Do you solve this problem? I have the same error, but I don't know how to solve it

A:

This can have several causes.

pose1 might simply be unreachable by the arm -> use a pose of which you know that it is reachable
pose1 is reachable but the inverse kinematics plugin failed to find a joint configuration that results in the end-effector being near that pose -> use a different IK or different parameters (trac_ik or a specialized ikfast perform good)
The planner failed to find a path to the goal -> is there a path by which you can move from the current configuration to the goal configuration (within the specified software limits)
if there are paths the planner should be able to find, you might want to try a different planner -> e.g. group.setPlannerId("RRTConnectkConfigDefault")
the planner might find the path with more time available -> group.setPlanningTime(<insert-time-limit-here>)

Hi, I have a question that before I set the pose goal, how can I know whether the pgose goal is reachable? Is there any funtion in moveit to solve this problem?

Is there a Python functionality for that?

@tengfei and @nmelchert have a look at this answer
So in short:
plan = group.plan()
if not plan.joint_trajectory.points:
    # Error
