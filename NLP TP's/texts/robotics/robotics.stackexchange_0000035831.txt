Q:

Roboearth build fails at re_vision

I m trying to build roboearth on oneiric on electric version of ROS and using gcc4.6 compiler. but i came across with the following error:

[ 19%] Building CXX object
CMakeFiles/DUtilsCV.dir/src/3rdparty/DUtilsCV/Drawing.o

Any body with clue what's the meaning of error: taking address of temporary[-fpermissive] and how it can be resolved? Thanks in advanced.

A:

As of revision r1464, the RoboEarth object scanning software and re_vision should compile under Ubuntu Oneiric, too.
