Q:

How can I take use of nav2d.js

Hello,
I have read almost all of it,but it is hard to get the result.As is shown in the example,
var nav = new Nav2D({  ros : ros,
canvasID : "nav"
});
It can create an object successfully,but the function draw() in the nav2d.js has not been called,so there will not be any picture in the browser.Is there any correct example? I hope someone can help me,thank you.
Gerald

A:

To change map size, an easy way is to run the example file /example/nav2d.html, where you could change the canvas size.
