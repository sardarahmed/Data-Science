Q:

How to tune the two PIDs for quadrotor

I'm trying to implement two PIDs for stabilizing quadrotor for position tracking. The inputs are $x_{d}(t), y_{d}(t), z_{d}(t)$ and $\psi_{d}(t)$. For position tracking, usually the small angle assumption is assumed. This assumption allows for acquiring $\theta_{d}$ and $\phi_{d}$. These are the results 

The x-axis position is driving me crazy. After alot of attempts for tuning the PIDs, I felt something wrong is going on. Is this a normal behavior for PID controller? Also, what I've noticed is that once $\psi$ reaches to zero, the platform starts oscillating (after 1.5 second in the figure).   
For solving ODEs and computing the derivatives for the velocities, I use Euler methods. 

It is simulation in Matlab. 

A:

is it real or simulation application?
If simulation there is good examples in matlab codes/models you can look deeper 
If real:
1- filter the sensor data
2- use tan2 function for angular error calculations
3- begin PID calculations with all P, I and D constants. if you use just one of them stabilization is not possible. PI or PD control is possible. Be carefefull first constants P>I>D than you can use :
