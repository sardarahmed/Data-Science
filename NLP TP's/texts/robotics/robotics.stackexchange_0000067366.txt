get the yaw angle between two frames

I have two frames, one is global frame, another is UAV frame. And i also have the transform between them.
how to get the yaw angle between global frame to UAV frame , So i can know the angle between global frame x_axis and  UAV framex_axis.

A:

You can find it using rotation matrix.
get rotation matrix from transform. Each column in matrix represent unit vector along new axis. First column represent  unit vector of along new x-axis.
if m0, m1, m2 are elements of first column, angle between old and new x-axis is
