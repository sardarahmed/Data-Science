Q:

Visualizing a point cloud previously stored in an array

Hello,
I'd like to visualize a point cloud by using rviz. The points' coordinates were previously stored in an array that contains the x-, y- and z-coordinates of each point within a struct data type. I tried to store this data in the corresponding ~.x, ~.y, ~.z members of a pcl::PointXYZ object. However, I am not sure if this works and if so, how to make it to the publication of this cloud, so I can see something on rviz.
It would be great if someone could tell how this works.
Kevin
