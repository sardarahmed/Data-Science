Q:

ethzasl_icp_mapper doesn't publish data

Hi,
I am trying to use the "ethzasl_icp_mapping" package with a kinect.I roslaunch : "sensor.launch", "tracker.launch" and "tracker_viewer-groovy.launch" the topic "/point_map" is being published but there is no data in it. This has been verified with 'rostopic echo /point_map' and also on Rviz
rqt_graph shows that the "/mapper" node subscribes to "/stereo_camera/points2","/tf" and publishes "/point_map", "/icp_odom" and "/icp_error_odom".
How can i make this package work ?
Thank you

A:

Are you launching "sensor.launch", "tracker.launch" and "tracker_viewer-groovy.launch" in three different terminals? You need to run only "tracker_viewer-groovy.launch". By launching all three files, I get the same error which you mentioned. /mapper must subscribe to "/depth_registered/points".
