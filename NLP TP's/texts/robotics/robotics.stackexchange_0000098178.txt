Q:

move_base_flex and flexbe

Hi,
Me and my team have been looking into the possibility of switching from move_base (http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) to move_base_flex (http://wiki.ros.org/move_base_flex), since this last one is compatible with SMACH state machines and would allow us to elaborate in more complex recovery mechanisms. Considering that mostly of our decision making is implemented using FlexBe (http://wiki.ros.org/flexbe), which expands SMACH in so many ways, We would like to know if it is possible to combine FlexBe with move_base_flex, in order to get the best of the two worlds. Although on paper it should be possible, is there any known limitation?

Hi,
short answer: yes. move_base_flex is what u need (or navigation2 if u are using ROS2).
I also use SMACH to call MBF actions; see here some states I use. My states are very thin wrappers for smach_ros.SimpleActionState class, e.g. this is my wrapper for MoveBase action. U may need to add a GetPath and Recovery states to call these other MBF actions, but it will be trivial (or I can add them, if you are not sure how to). Or you can include smach_ros.SimpleActionState and provide the action details directly, if you don't need any extra functionality.
