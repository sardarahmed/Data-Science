Q:

FCL integration

I'd like to use FCL as a collision checker in my own planner that's currently not plugged into Moveit. Is there any documentation or code out there that can help me integrate FCL into my planner? I'm going to be testing on the PR2, so I'd imagine people have done this before Moveit, but I can't find any information.

A:

The online doxygen documentation should be helpful. There´s also a wrapper in OMPL.
I´d recommend taking a look at the implementation in MoveIt! as a lot of what has been done there will be highly relevant to your use case, too (especially considering that you´re likely also using the PR2 URDF model, so a lot of the link transform setup etc. should transfer). Looking at this blog post from 2012 it seems that a lot of FCL is relatively new, so OMPL and MoveIt! are likely the most comprehensive usage examples.

Another good source of documentation on usage of FCL is the tests within FCL.
