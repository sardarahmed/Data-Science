Q:

roswtf communcation error bug in Ubuntu 11.04

Hi there,
I am using ros-diamondback on Ubuntu 11.04-64bit.
I am launching the following launch file:
<launch>
     <node pkg="tf type="static_transform_publisher" name="blub" args ="0 0 0 0 0 0 blub blub2 100" />
</launch>

In another terminal I run roswtf
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf
No package or stack in context
================================================================================
Static checks summary:

No errors or warnings
================================================================================

Online checks summary:

Found 2 error(s).

ERROR Communication with [/blub] raised an error: 
ERROR Communication with [/rosout] raised an error: 

I tried to set ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME by hand, but still the same error. The funny thing is, that there is no error. Everything works as expected. I can listen to the tf topic and receive data.
Can anybody tell me, why roswtf thinks that there is an error?
Thx
