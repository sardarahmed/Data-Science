Q:

Hide some topics when launching a node?

Some nodes I launch publish topics I never intend to use, and they just clutter up the namespace.  Is there a way to prevent a node from publishing a topic at launch time?

Other than editing the source of the node in question?
No.

If you are worried about collisions and / or multiple nodes publishing to the same topic, and you'd like to avoid that, you could make use of remapping or namespacing.
