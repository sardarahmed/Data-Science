Q:

Problem with Gazebo after update

Hello,
I updated gazebo today (from apt (ubuntu 12.04)) and when i load one of my robots to gazebo all of the robot parts appear in random places.
URDF for my robot is located in : https://github.com/RCPRG-ros-pkg/lwr_robot/tree/electric/lwr_defs

After updating to svn trunk it works much better.
But that not solve all of my problems, the second robot link appear translated from its base. It looks like a problem with chaining of fixed links. When i remove the world link and world to world_link joint the offset disappear.

A:

update
Ok, there was another issue, thanks konradb3 for the patch!  The new release simulator_gazebo 1.6.16 deb is out.

Thanks for posting the model, I was able to test it and found a transform bug when I tried to tweak the urdf2gazebo parser.  It's fixed in trunk.  I'll make a release (simulator_gazebo 1.6.14) this weekend.

I checked the svn trunk and it works much better but some problems still remains.

i'm seeing a similar problem with the Robonaut2 simulator since the update as well.

Problem also exists with the youBot URDF from https://github.com/youbot/youbot-ros-pkg

I'm seeing similar problems as well. Is there documentation somewhere on the best way to checkout simulator_gazebo from svn trunk and replace the existing version I got from apt-get without goofing everything up?
Comment by shart115 on 2012-08-28:
any updates on this fix?  It is somewhat unclear whether the trunk fixes this issue (and it doesnt look like 1.6.14 has been released yet...
Comment by hsu on 2012-08-28:
just released 1.6.14 yesterday, deb should be out in a day or two.  Is the second picture in your original question correct?  That's what I see as well.  Is there suppose to be a gap between calib_lwr_arm_base_link and lwr_arm_1_link as shown?  Also, you mentioned that something else is broken?
Comment by hsu on 2012-08-28:
If possible, can you post a picture of what the model should look like?  thanks.
Comment by hsu on 2012-08-31:
can someone confirm that simulator_gazebo 1.6.14 fixes the issue?
