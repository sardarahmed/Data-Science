Q:

Why is eclipse complaining about links?

I'm trying to open costmap_2d in eclipse, but I get the following error when trying to import:

Error processing changed links in project description file. Cannot create a link to '/home/tim/ros_source/electric/navigation/costmap_2d' because it overlaps the location of the project that contains the linked resource.

I have no idea what this means. I get similar errors for all other packages.
I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10. I've successfully built ROS from source. I have eclipse indigo for c/c++ developers. Here's what I'm doing:

rosmake costmap_2d
make eclipse-project
open eclipse
Import... > General > Existing project
Browse to /home/tim/ros_source/electric/ros_comm/clients/cpp/roscpp
don't select copy into workspace, press finish
error

The project seems to get partially imported, but it's pretty manged.

The manged project has some issues. They might be related, or they may just be a side effect.

Invalid project path: Include path not found (/home/tim/ros_source/electric/driver_common/dynamic_reconfigure/msg/cpp).

Invalid project path: Include path not found (/home/tim/ros_source/electric/driver_common/dynamic_reconfigure/srv/cpp).

Invalid project path: Include path not found (/home/tim/ros_source/electric/ros/core/roslib/msg_gen/cpp/include).

The first two seems a little weird, shouldn't those be msg_gen/cpp/include and srv_gen/cpp/include?
I'm also confused on the third one, because roslib doesn't generate messages, right?

Don't feel offended, please. You haven't written what solutions you already tried, which one normally should do if had tried any.

BTW, try posting a constructive comment next time. Do you honestly think I haven't already googled it?

Yeah I agree, it's an eclipse problem. But I posted it here because I image other developers are seeing the same thing, given I have a fresh install (and I haven't done anything weird, I promise). And if I figure it out myself, I can answer my own question.

This seems to be a problem of the directory tree and is rather Eclipse related, I'd look for solutions elsewhere, like on stackoverflow. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=because+it+overlaps+the+location+of+the+project+that+contains+the+linked+resource

A:

The warnings are a result of packages exporting a non-existing paths in their manifest, see these previous discussions on ros-users:
http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/ROS-Eclipse-warnings-td2479833.html
http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/Please-remove-references-to-msg-cpp-and-srv-cpp-from-package-manifests-td2168967.html#a2170278
Packages still exporting these paths should be ticketed for a fix (they just need to remove the non-existant include path from the manifest). That being said, I don't think it's related to your first problem. I have seen plently of these warnings using Eclipse, but never your first error.

This doesn't seem to fix the issue. The first error still persists for me when trying to work on the slam_gmapping package.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7000562/eclipse-cannot-create-a-link-to-dir-generated-by-cmake says it's because of the build directory, but the ros wiki page says that the make command should take care of this itself http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#Creating_the_Eclipse_project_files
