Q:

how to use ueye_cam to drive my UI1221-m camera

hi all
i have an ueye UI-1221-M camera and i am trying to use ueye_cam to drive it.
i have installed the IDS driver and can use the driver to open the camera.
when i use "roslaunch ueye_cam rgb8.launch" the erro comes as follow.
    process[nodelet_manager-1]: started with pid [2384]
    process[ueye_cam_nodelet-2]: started with pid [2385]

** It seems that missing lib file how to deal with the problem? any help is appriciate**
[Update]
Hi, thanks for your reply
I have re-cloned the code and  the error didn't disappear:
    [ INFO] [1383981887.637572692]: Initializing nodelet with 4 worker threads.

And i find problems when i build the package"rosmake ueye_cam"   The MAKE process is really fast , i think many of the file did not MAKE correctly...

@anqixu  please help me with it
Comment by anqixu on 2013-11-09:
Your new run shows the correct nodelet type of ueye_cam/ueye_cam_nodelet rather than ueye_cam/include/ueye_cam_nodelet. Also, the default repo branch is for catkin, not rosmake. So either use catkin_make (groovy&up) or switch branch: git clone https://github.com/anqixu/ueye_cam.git --branch fuerte
Comment by vippt on 2013-11-10:
hi anqixu thanks
i am useing the groovy but i can't config the catkin_make (i'm new here), so i downloaded the fuerte code and it works with my ueye.
Comment by Vero on 2014-01-10:
Hi anqixu. I'm using ROS hydro, compiling the package with catkin_make, but I still have the same problem:
[ERROR] [1389397299.178431342]: Failed to load nodelet [/ueye_cam_nodelet] of type [ueye_cam/ueye_cam_nodelet]: Could not find library corresponding to plugin ueye_cam/ueye_cam_nodelet. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.
The library exist and it is in the right path.
How can I solve this problem?
Comment by anqixu on 2014-01-11:
@Vero: hmm that's very weird. try checking out the fuerte branch and compiling (with rosbuild). Please also confirm that under the path [catkin_ws]/devel/lib, you have the files libueye_cam_nodelet.so libueye_wrapper.so
Comment by Vero on 2014-01-11:
The package ueye_came-fuerte compiles and runs. The hydro version still has a problem. I can confirm that  under the path [catkin_ws]/devel/lib there are the files libueye_cam_nodelet.so libueye_wrapper.so
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2014-01-12:
Since the libraries exist but are not getting found we need some more information to narrow it down. Can you please add the output of the following commands from the shell where your roslaunch invocation failed to your question? "rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nodelet | grep ueye" and "env | grep CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH" and "".
Comment by anqixu on 2014-01-17:
Since your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH does not contain the path of your workspace it looks like that you have not sourced the workspace/devel/setup.bash file. Can you make sure to do that and try again?
Comment by anqixu on 2014-01-20:
Please make sure to source your [catkin_workspace]/devel/setup.bash file prior to compiling and running any catkin-based ROS packages, such as ueye_cam. The erroneous behaviors resulting from not sourcing this file appears to be consistent with several of the symptoms reported here.

A:

I solve the problem.  It was a problem of the id of the cameras. I used the master_slaves_rgb8.launch and I modified the id name.
