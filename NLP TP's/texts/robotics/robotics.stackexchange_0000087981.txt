Q:

Is there a way to undo workspace chaining?

From my $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, I realised my workspaces have been chained together. Is there a way to undo it?

A:

for catkin_make:

Delete build, devel and install.
Source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
catkin_make

for catkin_tools:

catkin clean --yes (essentially the same as above)
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/<DISTRO>
catkin build
