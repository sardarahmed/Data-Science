Q:

How can I change the map size and the origin?

Dear all,
   I have made a map successfully,but it was not so good. How can I change the map size through the gmapping parameters? 
   The map is useless because there are so many unknown regions , so the map looks so little in the middle of the picture. Although I modified the parameter (max_Range, max_Urange ,x_min and  so on（gmapping）)，but I still can not get a good result. 
   Now my map ：pan.baidu.com/s/1jGwnoto .
   the map I really want is just like : pan.baidu.com/s/1eQzdnea (sorry that's a link, please copy it).

By the way, How can I make the origin(.yaml file) [0 0 0]?
Best Regards!
Gerald

A:

You have to change the xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax parameters, maxRange and maxUrange (without underscore) are for laser!! You can find the complete list of parameters here.
