Q:

Why is Gazebo not loading a model?

I am trying to work with Gazebo using xacro files. It seems that it works with Rviz, but there is no model in Gazebo. Please take a look at the files here: https://github.com/matrhint/model-problems  I am running Kinetic. I am using roslaunch lawnmow_description lawnmow_rviz.launch and roslaunch lawnmow_gazebo lawnmow_world.launch to test it out.
Thank you for any assistance.

In your URDF and xacro files, you shouldn't have absolute paths to resources like meshes. Use the package:// syntax instead.

A:

When I changed all the mesh paths in lawnmow.xacro to use the package:// syntax, Gazebo displayed the model when I launched lawnmow_world.launch.

For example, the first one I changed to:
package://lawnmow_description/meshes/frame.stl

I also had to add <intertial> tags to the lfcaster and rfcaster links, because Gazebo will not simulate links that do not have inertia information.

Thank you for your fast response! That is exactly what I want. I tried: <mesh scale="0.01 0.01 0.01" filename="package://lawnmow_description/meshes/frame.stl"/> and it didn't work for me. I then changed it to <mesh filename="package://lawnmow_description/meshes/frame.stl"/> another no-go.

Edit: I was changing the wrong file. Your suggestion was correct. Thank you for your fast response and clear answer!

Any ideas why the front casters aren't showing up in gazebo?
Comment by Geoff on 2017-04-26:
You don't have <intertial> tags in the two caster links. Gazebo will only use links that have intertia information.

You are my hero, but it didn't work. I copied the <inertial> information from the left_wheel and placed it after the </visual> tab, but still no casters.

Can you put a copy of your lawnmow.xacro somewhere so I can see? I did exactly that and I get casters.
Comment by matrhint on 2017-04-26:
I updated it on the github. Thanks again.
Comment by Geoff on 2017-04-26:
Using your exact source in Kinetic, and running roslaunch lawnmow_gazebo lawnmow_world.launch, I get casters. Does Gazebo print any errors at all? Have you tried cleaning your workspace?
Comment by matrhint on 2017-04-26:
I tried catkin_make clean and still no casters. I get red writing when gazebo is launched that says gazebo-2 process has died pid 29628 and goes on to say where the log file is.

Every time? If Gazebo is crashing, you will need to fix that problem first.
Comment by matrhint on 2017-04-26:
Yes every time. I will open a new question for that issue. Thank you so much for all of your help.

killall gzserver fixed the issues. I now have casters in Gazebo!

Great! I'll add the extra info to the answer.
