Q:

ImportError for rqt plugin

Hello,
I want to create a rqt plugin for bagfile comparison called rqt_bag_comparison. Therefore I have followed the tutorial "Create your new rqt plugin", step by step.
When trying to start the plugin from the rqt_gui, I get the following error message:
RosPluginProvider.load(rqt_bag_comparison/BagComparisonPlugin) exception raised in __builtin__.__import__(rqt_bag_comparison.bag_comparsion, [BagComparison]):
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rqt_gui/ros_plugin_provider.py", line 77, in load
    module = __builtin__.__import__(attributes['module_name'], fromlist=[attributes['class_from_class_type']], level=0)
ImportError: No module named bag_comparsion

Apparently, my module is not found. However, in the relative folder to where all my nodes are placed rqt_bag_comparison/src/rqt_bag_comparison/ there is the file bag_comparison.pyas well as __init__.py.
Is there anything I might have done wrong in the setup, that explains that the module cannot be found?

A:

From your directory structure containing the init.py file src/rqt_bag_comparison/ your module name would be rqt_bag_comparison, not bag_comparison.
So I would guess your plugin.xml has the wrong setting for type. It should be type="rqt_bag_comparison.bag_comparison.BagComparison", if your plugin's class is named BagComparison inside bag_comparison.py.
