Q:

ICP 3D scan matching algorithms

Hi guys,
I am looking for latest scan matching algorithms based on ICP, implemented for 3D case in ROS. Can you give me some examples? Thanks!

There are many point cloud libraries out there that have support for ICP, and most of these could easily be integrated into a ROS application. PCL is an obvious choice, and I've lately had good luck with Open3D

A:

the point cloud library (PCL) is included with ROS for these types of task. It has a full implementation of the ICP algorithm, with a tutorial here.
If you can tell us more about your application including how you're acquiring the 3D information then we may be able to give you a more specific answer.
