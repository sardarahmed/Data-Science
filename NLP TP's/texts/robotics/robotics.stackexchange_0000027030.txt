Q:

installing gazebo 3.0 from source... "cannot open shared object" error

Hello,
I've made numerous attempts to get around this issue... read all similar past queries, but I'm completely new to linux so I have absolutely no idea how to interpret some of the answers
so, in the instructions (http://gazebosim.org/wiki/3.0/install), step 10, you're told to execute "gazebo", I end up with:
gazebo: error while loading shared libraries: libgazebo_common.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
during cmake, the installation path was shown as: /home/derek/gazebo_source/gazebo/build
it said to take note of this, so I did.  I then came upon instructions later about installation to local directories and such,
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<install_path>/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=<install_path>/local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<install_path>/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

I tried every variation of replacing the <install_path> with the one designated by the cmake output, but to no avail... then, at the end of the instructions, you get this:
echo '/usr/local/lib' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gazebo.conf 
sudo ldconfig

again, I don't really know what /usr/local/lib (i understand that this is where user files go, but as far as relating this to the GUI directory of /home/USER/gazebo etc) means, I tried every combination of prefixes that I could think of
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, thank you

If you have run cmake with the proper CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX pointing to /usr the libraries should end up with the libraries on /usr/lib/... and don't need to use ldconfig at all.

this will be a last resort if i cant find a solution for the current installation, but will definitely give it a go tonight if i cant resolve this.

Hi,
when running the
echo '/usr/local/lib' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/gazebo.conf 
sudo ldconfig

command make sure you change '/usr/local/lib' to where your gazebo libraries are, do a $ locate libgazebo in the terminal to find out where they are.
Cheers,
Andrei

i typed in "locate libgazebo" into a terminal, doesn't return anything... i tried a variety of 'search' and 'find' commands i found on the web to ID the correct path, nothing works :/

tried $locate libgazebo, said "libgazebo not found", tried $locate libgazebo_common.so.3, same thing :/

find /usr -name libgazebo*
