Q:

Can i use DC Brushed motors for building a drone?

I want to make a drone. But my budget is very low. Brushless motors are very expensive. I want use the Brushed CHEAP ones. can i us them ?

A:

I would definitely look at a brushed motor when the budget is low. They have a reputation of being less powerful, but the main problem is they have a very high RPM. This means you either have to use very small inefficient propellers or a geared system. Brushed geared mini-drones have pretty good performance when it comes to battery life because the propeller is big compared to the weight. Small, coreless brushed motors are pretty efficient but wear out after some time.

A:

Most cheap small multirotors use use brushed motors.
Some examples:

The drawback with brushed motors is that they are much less efficient and can produce less torque. Thus, they have to run at a much higher RPM in order to produce sufficient power.
I think you will find that it will be harder to manage crisp control of your multirotor with brushed motors.
