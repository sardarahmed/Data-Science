Q:

Error compiling pcl_ros on Debian

Hi there!
I get an error (or lets say a huge error message) when i try to compile pcl_ros on my Debian:sqeezy.
The first error is:
error: ‘__s_getMD5Sum’ is not a member of ‘pcl::PointIndices’
I installed the PCL Library with the instructions given at http://pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html for Debian as distro.
But at the moment, I'm not sure where to look for the problem and how to solve it.
Please give me some tips...
Thanks

A:

Before a compiling pcl, the FLANN package needs to be installed from sources via
git clone https://github.com/wg-debs/flann.git
make & make install

To install PCL, the solution was to explicitely take the sources from the wg-debs archive via cloning the GIT repository
 git clone https://github.com/wg-debs/pcl.git

To get the package working, i had to switch some build parts on or off with the command
cmake ../ -DUSE_ROS=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_global_tests=OFF
          -DBUILD_examples=OFF -DBUILD_visualization=ON

before calling
make -j8 & make install

I also added the libraries libgtest-dev and libvtk5-dev to the yaml File i created (for the dependencies).
