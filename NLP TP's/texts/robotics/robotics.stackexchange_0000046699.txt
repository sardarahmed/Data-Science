Q:

TurtleBot simulator does not launch properly

I used VirtualBox ROS provided by NooTriX. When I launch TurtleBot simulator by typing
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
it keeps showing a warning message
Warning [RaySensor.cc:206] ranges not constructed yet (zero sized)
and as a result, I cannot type anything. Then later, Gazebo closes by itself. Can anyone help me?

A:

Well, I can type additional commands by opening a new terminal.
Sometimes Gazebo closes by itself especially when the motion is fast. But when I pause the motion, it will not close by itself. It suggests that the problem is related to display card or RAM ???

My guess is memory.
I'm having the same problem. I'll start it myself.
