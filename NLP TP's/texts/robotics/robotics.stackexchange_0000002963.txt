Q:

How do I learn about Arduino/raspberry-pi based robotics on my own?

I am interested in learning how to build a dynamic quadcopter, and hope to be fairly proficient with Arduino/raspberry-pi. What resources and/or practices might you recommend? 

A:

In your shoes, I would start "simpler".

First, I would make a system that cycles between LED states (on/off/blinking) based on interaction with a sensor. That's to get the basics.
Then, I would build a little "truck" bot, one that can drive around my room without getting stuck. This is (especially in MY room, where navigation between all sorts of stuff is risky...) already an interesting challenge.
Next, I would add navigation (get some points/GPS-positions/emitters/NFC-tags/anything-that-suits-you in my room and go around them with the bot, which seems to be something you want your quadcopter to be able to do so that it knows how to come home, once you have GPS integrated)
Next I would add a few circuits for balancing (you really want the quad to know up from down, and handle their stability well). Side note, if you are on the equator, factor that in your system. It seems American F-16s had to be upgraded (a long while ago...) when the US Air Force had the nasty surprise of having them roll 180Â° when passing the equator :D

At that point, you're much more savvy than I'll ever be ;)
