May I ask what you would gain from running them separatly?

A:

I'm no expert and it's hard to prove a negative, but I think it is not possible. I conclude so by briefly examining the source code for rosmaster and rosparam:

rosparam

rosmaster

As far as I see there is no server code in the rosparam implementation, but just the dictionary logic. The server stuff is in the rosmaster code. See Line 324.
