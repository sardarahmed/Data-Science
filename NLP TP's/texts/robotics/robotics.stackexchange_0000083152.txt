Q:

"brics_actuator" for ROS Kinetic

Hi,
I am trying to use a package Youbot Simulation. The problem is that it asks me for brics_actuator. I have tried using this link and this link.
I shall be very thankful to you if someone could give me some clue to help me resolve this.
I am using ROS Kinetic.
Thank You in advanced.
=========== Edit 1 ==============
After using this link, I got the following error,
    In file included from /opt/ros/kinetic/include/moveit/macros/class_forward.h:40:0,

I believe that I have to enable C++11. Could you please tell me how did you do it? I think the error which I was receiving previously has been removed.

A:

You likely just need to clone this repo into your workspace's src directory and then run catkin_make to properly build the messages required by your package.

I have tried but it does not work.

Could you possibly edit your question to explain how or why it does not work?
Comment by jarvisschultz on 2017-10-05:
I just tested and I was able to compile a workspace that contained only the youbot_simulation package you linked and the brics_actuator package I linked on Kinetic. The only change I needed to make was enabling C++11 for the youbot_arm_kinematics_moveit package.

This is probably not the best CMake-y way to do this, but I just added SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11") to the CMakeLists.txt in the youbot_arm_kinematics_moveit directory.
