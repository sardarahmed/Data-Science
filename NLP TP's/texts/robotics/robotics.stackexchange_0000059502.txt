Q:

Colorgcc in combination with catkin_make to colorize compiler output

Hello,
I was trying to colorize the compiler output of catkin_make. I tried using colorgcc.
As per the manual I created symlinks to c++, g++, gcc, and cc to point to colorgcc and added the directory to the PATH. When compiling without catkin_make the colorization works, with catkin_make it does not.
Any help getting this to work is much appreciated.
Kind regards,
Okke Hendriks

A:

It should work. Did you do this for a new workspace? Otherwise, you might need to make clean once as cmake stores the compiler path.
