Q:

nav stack missing from UbuntuARM install

I am following this page:
http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/UbuntuARM
and have it working, but cannot find the install package for navigation.
apt-cache search ros-groovy
does not show up a nav package other than nav_msgs.
So, of course,
sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-navigation
just returns this:
Unable to locate package ros-groovy-navigation
How do I get programs like amcl, move_base, etc. installed?

A:

Looking at the build farm status and the navigation packages are all in red (missing) for groovy.

However, good news, they are all green for hydro.

So I am moving to Ubuntu 13.04 and hydro.
