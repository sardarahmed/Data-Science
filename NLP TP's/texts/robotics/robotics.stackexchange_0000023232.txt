Q:

Is using a robotic operating system still considered bare-metal C?

I want to get experience with low-level, bare-metal programming and am not sure if a project that uses an ROS counts as that.

A:

Bare metal programming is defined by not using any abstractions that might be provided by an OS and working directly with the hardware. Wikipedia Technopedia.
ROS provides an even higher level framework which builds on top of your computer OS, such as Linux, or Windows.
You can learn a lot about low level concepts while using frameworks such as ROS. And you likely will find that you may want to select a specific part of a larger system to implement at the lowest level. A good learning project could be to reimplement an existing piece of functionality in bare metal instead of trying to recreate the entire system at the lowest level.
