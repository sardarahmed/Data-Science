Q:

ublox RXM messages

We are using the ublox_gps package to log data from my C94-M8P evaluation board. Specifically, we are interested in using the raw GNSS data for positioning algorithms. For this purpose, we need to use ublox RXM messages. I configured our node to publish all supported messages (see config file below).
When I start our ublox_gps node, there are some messages published:

However, there are no RXM messages (such as rxmraw), although these message formats are supported by ublox_gps. If I check the configuration of my receiver via u-center, RXM messages are sent frequently.
When I try the same with an older u-blox receiver (EVK-6H), RXM messages are generated (rxmalm, rxmeph, rxpraw, rxmsfrb).
So did I miss a point in my configuration? Or is there any other reason why no RXM messages are generated on newer u-blox devices?
This is my config file:

A:

After further inspection and testing it turned out to be an issue caused by some inaccurate formulation in u-blox protocoll specification. Details can be found on the Github page.
