Q:

With hydro, pcl can be installed alone?

Hi, everyone.
I'd like to install pcl stand-alone.
Could you tell me how to do it ?
Since I've installed ros hydro through "desktop-full",
pcl(perception_pcl) has also being installed.
So I can see libpcl** under /usr/lib.
However, pcl/gpu is not found and I cannot try kinfu.
I gues that pcl installed with ros has a small part of full-pcl.
Then I'd like to install pcl stand-alone.
I'm afraid that I will have confliction between pcl installed stand-alone and pcl installed with ros.
How can I install pcl stand-alone ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

If you want to use KinFu with ROS see my answer in http://answers.ros.org/question/142461/pcl-kinfu-in-ros-hydro/
If you want to try KinFu in a PCL stand-alone version just clone the PCL repository, set DBUILD_GPU=ON and "make" it.
There is no reason for "make install".
