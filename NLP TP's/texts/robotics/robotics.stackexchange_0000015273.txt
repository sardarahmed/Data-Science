Q:

Receiver is getting really hot

I am building a quadcopter and I am on the last part of it (normally the exciting part) where I bind the controller to the receiver. 
I can get the receiver, which is plugged into the quadcopter, to be recognized by the controller. The problem is that I can't get the controller to rotate the propellers. 
When I touch the receiver it is hot. Not just warm, but very hot. I replaced the receiver already since it looked like the heat was too much and melted something on it.
Any thoughts as to why the receiver is so hot? Maybe it's because I hooked something up incorrectly? Perhaps the heat is causing the controller not to turn the motors?
Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.
HARDWARE:

Controller - FlySky FS-i6
Receiver - FS-iA6 (6 channels, 2.4 GHZ)
Power Supply - Tattu R-Line 14.8V 1300mAh

The board it connects to is using 5v.

A:

There were two issues that I resolved...
Firstly, I re-soldered the wires to the NAZE. I wanted to make sure that the connections were correct and it seemed they might be off.
Secondly, I switched the receiver to the iA6B. 
The receiver is not heating up anymore.
