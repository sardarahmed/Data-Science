Q:

turtlebot_simulator on hydro barely usable due to robot slipping

I just tried out the turtlebot_simulator for hydro (everything installed from .debs) using a roomba base and the robot is moving pretty erratic. If a turn is commanded, the robot will keep rotating after 0 turn rate is commanded. It looks like this is a problem with friction parameters and IÂ´m pretty sure this worked better last time I tried (more than a year ago). Any suggestions on how to improve the situation are appreciated.

A:

Looked into this and it appears the friction parameters were way off. After changing them to be the same as on the Kobuki, things are working fine. See also turtlebot_create pull request 20.
