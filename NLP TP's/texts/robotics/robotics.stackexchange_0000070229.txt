Q:

How to solve '[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named ...'?

Ubuntu 12.04
ROS Hydro
I am a freshman to ROS, recently I create nodes according to the book ‘Learning ROS for Robotics Programing Second Edition’,
but after I execute ‘rosrun’, something strange happend:
rosrun chapter2_tutorials chap2_example1_a
It shows that:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named chap2_example1_a below /home/exbot/dev/catkin_ws/src/chapter2_tutorials
Actually, the executable chap2_example1_a exists in  /home/dev/catkin_ws/devel/lib
I think something is wrong with the path. But I am not sure.
How to solve it?
Thank you~

Can you show us the output of catkin config? Perhaps you need to  sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools for that.
Do you have multiple catkin workspaces on your machine?

A:

Most probably you need to source devel/setup.bash
see here for similar question

Thanks.
But it doesn't help.
In the end of my ~./bashrc, I already have export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/dev/catkin_ws:/home/exbot/rosbuild_ws/sandbox:/home/exbot/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks  If I add source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash in the end. It even can't find

Don't set ROS_PACKAGE_PATH yourself, let setup.bash of the appropriate workspace do that. Remove that line (export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=..), and change source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash to source the setup.bash from your workspace (ie: devel/setup.bash). Then open new terminal, and try again.
