Seems like this is a GitHub question rather than a ROS question. By "workspace" do you mean your source code?

Would #q347421 cover this?

A:

The way the instructions recommend handling this is version control for each package in your workspace, and a separate metafile that stores where each package is hosted/which branch to use
from the dashing build from source instructions

Create a workspace and clone all
repos:
mkdir -p ~/ros2_dashing/src
cd ~/ros2_dashing
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/dashing/ros2.repos
vcs import src < ros2.repos

here's what the text looks like in this .repos file
  ros2/rclcpp:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp.git
    version: dashing
  ros2/rclpy:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/ros2/rclpy.git
    version: dashing
  ros2/rcpputils:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/ros2/rcpputils.git
    version: dashing
