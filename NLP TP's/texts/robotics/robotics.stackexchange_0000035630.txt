you should start with the tutorials, it will be easier than understand the whole system by yourself.

A:

The erratic_description package is a good and complete example for a moving mobile base using the DiffDrivePlugin as a gazebo controller. Especially in urdf/erratic_base.xacro you can see how to use the plugin in your urdf model.
To see a running example run:
roslaunch erratic_description erratic_empty_world.launch

This starts gazebo and spawns the erratic model. Then run
rosrun erratic_teleop erratic_keyboard_teleop 

You can now move the robot using the keys WASD.

you can also use shift + WASD for speed up!
