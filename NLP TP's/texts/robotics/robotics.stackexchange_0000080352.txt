Q:

mapviz - transforming local xy coordinate frame to tile map lat/lon coordinate frame

I am running a tile map plugin for mapviz. As I move my mouse on the map I can see the GPS coordinates changing on the ui interface. I also used the swri_transform_util to give my robot a lat/lon xy origin. Now I am trying to use the point click publisher to get lat/lon coordinates when a place on the map is clicked. I am not sure what the tile map frame is however. I can get my robot's local xy position when I click on the map, but not sure how to transform it to the lat/lon coordinate.

A:

As I was looking in some of the other swri packages there is a function called Wgs84FromLocalXy in package swri_transform_util. It takes local xy, referenced lat/lon, and outputs the transform(no tf). So it looks like in my subscriber I can call this function. I'm not sure if this is the best way to go about it, but it seems to work for me right now.

That is probably used because lat/long cannot be directly converted into metres in X and Y as used by tf, because they are angles referenced against a spheroid, not a perfect sphere. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#Expressing_latitude_and_longitude_as_linear_units
