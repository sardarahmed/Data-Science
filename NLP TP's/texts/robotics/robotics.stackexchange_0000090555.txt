Q:

Own nav path has closed loop in rviz

Hi,
I want to make simple path following for differential drive robot,
So, I generated nav.msg/Path with own points and publish it, but in rviz I see my path with connection between start and end points, but I want see just my arc.

When I use the code from Publisher about trajectory path to generate path from odom topic to path topic, I see not closed trajectory, that what I want to generate in my own path publisher.

What is my mistake?
How publish own points like nav.msg/Path correctly?
My source of publish node:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy

from nav_msgs.msg import Path
from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped
from geometry_msgs.msg import Pose

path = Path()
path.header.frame_id = 'odom'
seq = 0

def cartesian_to_path(x, y):
    global seq
    path.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()

    for i, xi in enumerate(x):
        pose = PoseStamped()
        pose.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()
        pose.header.frame_id = 'odom'
        pose.header.seq = seq
        pose.pose.position.x = xi
        pose.pose.position.y = y[i]
        pose.pose.position.z = 0
        path.poses.append(pose)
    seq += 1

    print(path)
    path_pub.publish(path)

rospy.init_node('path_node')
path_pub = rospy.Publisher('/path', Path, queue_size=10)
r = rospy.Rate(1)

A:

It was mistake with declaration the object of class Path(), it was global, so, path object was not rewrited, path data was appending every cycle of Rate.
correct source:
#...
from geometry_msgs.msg import Pose

def cartesian_to_path(x, y):
    path = Path()
    path.header.frame_id = 'odom'
    path.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()
    #...
 #...
