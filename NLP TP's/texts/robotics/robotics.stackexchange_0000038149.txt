Q:

electric turtlebot: android app can't load a map

Hi, everyone,
I'm working with Electric Turtlebot on ubuntu 11.10.
After downloading the latest mercurial source code of turtlebot_apps, the android "make a map" app works fine on my Android tablet.
But when i try to save the map, there's an error message on  the turtlebot netbook:
[ERROR] : Dynamic map getter service call failed.

It looks fine on the Android tablet though: "Map has been named xxxx."
Then I try to start the map navigation app, the tablet shows video stream, but can't load any map: "Starting the map selection service.."
After a few seconds, it just crushes.
Also the map manager app can't be started as well.
I've been looking at the topic data, it seems there's data published on /map when i try to save a map, but then the error messages appears, the SaveMap function stopped, and no data is published over /save_map.
Does anyone how to fix this problem??
Or is there anyway to get the source code of the android app? I might be able to have a look at the code and fix my problem.
Thanks....
