Q:

Path to dynamic libraries in ROS root system

I have two problems that I need some help:
First: find the PATH of dynamical libraries setup by ROS packages in the root of the system. For example, I have the gazebo_ros_pkgs package, which was setup by:

sudo apt-get install  ros-indigo-gazebo7-ros-pkgs

and I want to find the location of the follow library:

libgazebo_ros_camera.so

Second: find the PATH of dynamical libraries setup by GAZEBO with the command:

sudo apt-get install libgazebo6-dev.

A:

I don't really see any difference between the two cases you give us (both are installed system-wide by the apt package manager, they're not 'setup' by ROS nor Gazebo).
On Debian/Ubuntu, you could use something like dpkg -S <name_of_the_file> to find both the package name and the location of the file. In your case:
dpkg -S libgazebo_ros_camera.so

Alternatively, you could use a command like locate libgazebo_ros_camera.so, which should give you the location as well (but it depends on whether the db has been updated).
To find out what files were installed by apt for a specific package, you could use:
dpkg -L libgazebo6-dev

you could add | grep .so to find just the shared libraries, or | grep lib to find all occurrences of lib in the listing.
PS: note that this is not a ROS-specific problem, but rather a question about interacting with the apt package manager on a Debian/Ubuntu system.

Thank you for the help gvdhoorn . Now I understand the package manager. These commands solved my problem.
