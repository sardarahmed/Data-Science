Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: About roscore

I'm a beginner user of ROS . So, the question is very simple one.
When we use ROS, we have to run "roscore". But I can't understand why we have to do so.
Please teach me the reason.
If there are pages which explain about this, please tell me its link.

A:

This is clearly explained on the wiki page on the Master (emphasis mine):

The ROS Master provides naming and registration services to the rest of the nodes in the ROS system. It tracks publishers and subscribers to topics as well as services. The role of the Master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another. Once these nodes have located each other they communicate with each other peer-to-peer.

The Master also provides the Parameter Server.

The 'phonebook' aspect of the master can be compared to how a DNS server functions.
Note that ROS2 does not depend on a master to locate nodes, it is fully peer-to-peer.
