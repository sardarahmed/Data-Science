Q:

What means laserRetro in Gazebo

Hi all!
I'm not able to find documentation for parameter "laserRetro" of Gazebo world file. I saw this parameter in some file, but I'm not sure what exactly it means.

A:

In electric, a <laserRetro> element can be declared under gazebo's <geom:xxx> element, and was used to set the LaserScan intensities field when a simulated ray hits a surface.  As pointed out by PKG, this is not correct, but an extreme simplification.  This feature should be improved in Fuerte with the upcoming GPU version of laser range scanners currently being constructed.
