Q:

Impossible to initialize rosdep

I am trying to install ros-kinect (ubuntu 16.04), when I do sudo rosdep init I see:
ERROR: cannot download default sources list from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list
Website may be down.

I tried to make proxy server, used sudo -E rosdep init, no results. Is website really down? When it will be fixed?

Does wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list work (ie: you get the file contents)?

I tried. The result is:
Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)|151.101.36.133|:443... connected.
OpenSSL: error:14077419:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:tlsv1 alert access denied

It would seem it is impossible to open an SSL secured connection to the github servers from wherever you are. That is most likely the reason rosdep can't download the files it needs, not because the server is down. I'd try to solve the wget issue, rosdep will probably start working then too.

It works now. Thank you!

So what did you do?

A:

Hi All,
I had been facing the same issue of
ERROR: cannot download default sources list from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list
Website may be down.
This error is because of your system date & time settings. I corrected my systems date and time settings and rosdep init worked.
