Q:

Kinect ambient light information

Hi,
when I play with the Xbox I get warnings in case of a probably disturbance of the Kinect by ambient light. Is such an information available in one of the ROS-Kinect drivers?
Thanks for your help

Never heard about such packages, but seems one is easy to write: it just has to warn you whenever you have to many NaN values in your depth.
