Q:

How to kill nodes in launch file after 10 seconds

Hello!
I am launching 7 ROS nodes using a single launch file. Can I kill all nodes after 10 seconds (or x seconds) without doing ctrl+c? I am using C++ btw.

Thanks @gvdhoorn !
This is my bash script (runtime_benchmark.sh) if anyone is wondering:
#!/bin/bash

sleep 15

echo "Killing all nodes"

rosnode kill -a

And this is the part in the launch file:
    <node name="runtime_benchmark" pkg="kinect_pcl" type="runtime_benchmark.sh" />
