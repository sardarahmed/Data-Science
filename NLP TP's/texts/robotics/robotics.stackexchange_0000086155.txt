Q:

no element or plugin 'alsasrc'

Hi,
[System Info:]

Ubuntu 16.04 in a Virtualbox
Kernel: Linux 4.13.0-36-generic
Architecture: x86-64
ROS kinetic

I am trying to set up the audio pipeline with audio_common following the steps in this tutorial.
http://wiki.ros.org/audio_common/Tutorials/Streaming%20audio
When I try to test the audio pipeline with
gst-launch-0.10 alsasrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! alsasink 

I get the following error:
ERROR: pipeline could not be constructed: no element "alsasrc".

During the audio-common download I recognised that gstreamer version 1.0 was installed (not 0.10), but the command above gives the same error, even with gst-launch-1.0.
Does someone have an idea how to solve this and make the pipeline work?
Any comment would be appreciated!
Best
Nina

Is arrdem/Voicely#1 similar?

A:

Kind of. But I already had all plugins installed.
I now installed
sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-alsa
and it seemed that the pipeline was setup properly. But still i cannot hear my microphone input through the headphones...

That would be a different (ie: new) problem then.

Exactly.. that's why I opened this one.
