A:

This is a floating point error; it means that a program tried to do an illegal floating-point operation, such as dividing by zero or infinity.
Since the library in question is libdrm_radeon, which is part of the graphics driver, I suspect this is a either a rendering bug or a bug in your graphics drivers.
You may want to try upgrading your graphics drivers to the official ATI drivers.
