Thank you very much. You are right the reason is my computer getting too warm as it was very hot in my lab...

A:

I actually think that's not a problem with the hand detector but with your computer. Is guess the hand detector is using a lot of CPU. Is your computer maybe getting too warm?

+1 on this analysis. Bad CPU / RAM can also manifest as random crashes under heavy load; maybe you should run memtest.
