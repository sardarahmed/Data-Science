Q:

ros hello - problem

Hi, i was doing the beginner tutorial for accomodating a basic C++ 'Hello World' programme (helloROS.cpp) into ROS nodes, and i was following the steps to create a package. In step 2# "rospack find hello" it says "rospack not found" and I dont understand why... all the folders were created and are in the package hello in my documents.
Please help as soon as possible. Thank you!

helloROS.cpp is not in the standard tutorials.  Can you provide a link to the tutorial you are following?

@tfoote Seems I should take responsibility, I would think that this is the tutorial in reference, http://mobotica.blogspot.in/2011/12/hello-ros.html and I guess that this is a ROS_PATH issue, the package is probably not visible !

@tfoote I have made some modifications, I named it 'for a rookie' but never explained ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ! .... :-( ..... should work now !

A:

It's saying that rospack is not found.  Did you source the setup.bash in your active terminal?
