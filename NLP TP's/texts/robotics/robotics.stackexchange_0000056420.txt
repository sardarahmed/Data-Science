Q:

How to update gmapping continuously?

Hi all,
do someone know how to update the slam gmapping map more often.
I need continuous updates in time. It should not longer depend on the degree of exploration. So far I did not manage it, quite long delays appear until the map is extended.
I appreciate every hint ...
Thanks, Daniel

A:

Finally I localized the problem!
Since I am using the turtlebot, I launch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch.
If you have a closer look at the launch file, you will recognize that the correct parameters to set are localized in the following launch file:
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/_gmapping.launch
Following parameters have a big impact on the update speed:
param name="map_update_interval" value="0.1"  .... updates in sec
param name="delta" value="0.1" ...... grid of the map (here each block is 10cm * 10cm)
param name="particles" value="1" .... particles in the filer (default:30, which slows
down the updating procedure)
So I had to change these parameters and everything works fluently.
Hope I could help you with my experience.
BR Daniel

Thanks for your answer, it really helped me too.
I just wanted to add that it seems that modifying parameter when the slam_gmapping node is running with rosparam set DOESN'T WORK, you have to change the .launch file
