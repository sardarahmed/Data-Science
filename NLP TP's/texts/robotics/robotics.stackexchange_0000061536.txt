Q:

Detect the objects using velodyne HDL-32E

Hello ! I am using the LIDAR velodyne HDL-32E recently . The device was fixed on a car .
Now I can get the data from the device using package velodyne , and I need to detect the objects and terrain on the road .
So I want to know that is there any package or library can do it ?
I notice some information here :http://www.ros.org/news/robots/

Like many Urban Challenge vehicles, Marvin has a Velodyne HDL lidar and Applanix Position and Orientation System for Land Vehicles (POS-LV). Drivers for both of these are available in the utexas-art-ros-pkg applanix package and velodyne stack, respectively. The velodyne stack also includes libraries for detecting obstacles and drive-able terrain, as well as tools for visualizing in rviz.

Thank you ÔºÅ

A:

There is a velodyne_height_map package which detects most simple obstacles fairly reliably. It does not handle overhead tree branches or tunnels correctly.
We used an earlier version of that algorithm for the DARPA Urban Challenge competition.

Yes , thank you for your share ! I think I should search it by myself first  :)

That algorithm is simple and relatively efficient. Feel free to experiment with variant approaches.
