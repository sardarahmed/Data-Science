Q:

DC motor shaft and gear installation

I'm hoping to use a DC motor to drive a cog bar horizontally along a track. AFAIK, I'd need to install a (plastic) cog on the motor shaft, which itself grips on the (plastic) cog bar. Does anyone know how to prevent the cog from shifting on the shaft? The shaft is 10mm long and I'd like to make sure the cog cog sits at 5mm, where the cog bar is.
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks

A:

If the pinion will be close to the gearbox plate, use a washer or thrust bearing between the pinion and plate.  The washer can be made from teflon or polyethylene sheet, or you could use thin steel washers.  Shaft collars also can be used to keep the pinion from shifting in and out, but a pinion with a setscrew (as pictured below) would be more compact.  An N20 gear motor apparently has a 3 mm diameter shaft; one of the shaft collars below is 3 mm. The pictured thrust bearing is 2.5 mm bore.
