Q:

Windows 8.1 installation hangs on configure step of gazebo code

Hello, I am having trouble installing Gazebo on Windows 8.1. I have Visual Studio 2013 and have installed everything to the tee as described here, and get as far as step 11, the configure step for the main gazebo code. What happens is cmake says  Found ../../FreeImage-vc12-x64-release-debug/Source/FreeImage.h and then it hangs forever (I left it on all night and nothing happened). I independently compiled FreeImage in VS2013 and tried again, but same thing happens.
How do I get past this?
Also please do not suggest running in virtual linux as I have tried and it it much too slow for me. And I can't dual boot into linux for other reasons pertaining to my project.
Thanks

Just tried with version 6.1 and the exact same thing happens.

EDIT: After a lot of playing around with this and getting nowhere, I asked on bitbucket and found someone who had already compiled it, and he was so kind as to branch his version with all edits included to get it to compile with VS2013

Give it a try

Now I've narrowed it down to protobuf, I had to replace the 2.6.0 vc12 version with 2.6.1 to get it to install in vs2013, now I get these linkage errors with protocompiler:
[ 16%] Linking CXX executable gazebomsgs_out.exe
GazeboGenerator.cc.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: virt

I know I'm pointing to the right lib files because it wouldnt even finish the configure stage without that

If anyone has the Windows compiled version can they please host a torrent or upload it to MEGA?

I also had issues with Protobug during the configure step (see here). I ended up solving it by downgrading CMake from 3.5.1 to 3.2.0. Now I'm stuck on "NMAKE : fatal error U1077" for the next command though...
