Q:

Caught exception while loading: Character [-]

Hello,
today I made update of ROS (Ubuntu 11.04, ROS Electric from deb repo), run "roslaunch cob_bringup sim.launch" and then "rosrun rviz rviz", which gave me this error:
[ERROR] [1317112938.826534360, 19.093000000]: Caught exception while loading: Character [-] at element [4] is not valid in Graph Resource Name [cob3-3].  Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, / and _.

Before update if worked fine. I'm using git version of cob_simulation stack (with env. variables ROBOT=cob3-2, ROBOT_ENV=ipa-kitchen, SIMX=-r).

A:

I expect that some of the launch files are using the ROBOT environment variable in the node names to avoid name collisions.
A dash '-' is not a valid name for a node.  This has always been the policy.  I believe that in Electric the parser is now stricter about enforcing it.
