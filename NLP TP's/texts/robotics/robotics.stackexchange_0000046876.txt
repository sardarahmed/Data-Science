Q:

ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu from source Checkout Error

Hello,
Is there a new or updated rosinstall file for installing Fuerte from source?
From the wiki: ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu/Source
It pulls down the rosinstall from: ros.org/rosinstalls/fuerte-ros-full.rosinstall
In this file it pulls down the repos from: github.com/wg-debs
The files in that repo no longer exist as they have been moved to this repo I believe: github.com/ros-gbp
Now that the files have been moved, I am not sure about the correct versions I am suppose to pull down as they are not the same.
Does anyone have an updated rosinstall to install the Full version of ROS source for Fuerte?
Thank you
