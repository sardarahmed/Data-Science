Q:

How can I write a Gazebo Plug-in on MAC OS?

Hello everyone, I'm wondering if it's possible to write a Gazebo plug-in on MAC OS, so this means without ROS. Right now, I'm using the PX4 with Gazebo source and if I try to compile the already existing plug-ins I have multiple errors.
Thank you

A:

Yes it's possible to develop plugins for Gazebo on macOS (either Intel or arm64). You will need a source build of Gazebo Garden and possibly Ogre2 if you are planning on developing visual plugins.
An example of a plugin which has been developed on macOS is the latest version of the ArduPilot/ardupilot_gazebo plugin where the addition of the SITL_JSON backend was primarily developed on macOS.
