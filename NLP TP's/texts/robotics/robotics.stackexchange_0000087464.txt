Q:

how to start navigating underwater

Hello,
I trying to build an AUV based on ROS and I am wondering whether there is beneficial tools that already available that I can use, for example there is the navigation stack for indoor autonomous wheeled robot navigation.
is there any similar tools for underwater robots ?

Hi,
I found an interesting post on the Moveit! blog about integration with an AUV :
http://moveit.ros.org/moveit!/ros/2015/07/02/going-underwater.html
You could probably integrate Moveit!  with the UUV simulator based on Gazebo :
https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator
They have a lot of documentation, with already integrated AUV, you could design your own based on the code of these pre-existing AUV
Also, there is a community within ROS Discourse that talk about AUV and maritime robotics in general:
https://discourse.ros.org/c/maritime
They can probably help a lot.
But I didn't found any of-the-shelf project that you could use (But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist)
