Q:

Remove installed ROS package

I installed a ros package wih this command:

$ sudo apt-get install
ros-kinetic-novatel-gps-driver

Now I would like to remove this package and build it from its github page. What is the safest and cleanest way to do so?
I am aware of:

$ sudo apt remove ros-kinetic-novatel-gps-driver

or

$ sudo apt-get purge ros-kinetic-novatel-gps-driver

cheers,

This is not ROS-specific. apt (and apt-get) are tools provided by Debian (and Debian based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu).
remove and purge are exactly the two options you have to remove the Debian package.

A:

I think there is no need to remove it. You can build it from your github page again and swtich which version you want to use by  running the command source devel/setup.bash in your ROS workspace.
Hope it helps.
