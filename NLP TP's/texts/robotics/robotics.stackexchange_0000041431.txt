Q:

I can't see hokuyo_node information on rviz

I need help.
I tried this tutorial (link text), however I can see only black screen in rviz and the following error message is displayed:

[ WARN] [1339998294.058023439]:
Message from [/hokuyo_node] has a
non-fully-qualified frame_id [laser].
Resolved locally to [/laser].  This is
will likely not work in multi-robot
systems.  This message will only print
once.

When I tried rosnode hz scan, the following message is displayed:

A:

Ensure that your fixed frame in rviz is set to /laser (as shown in the picture in the tutorial).
Scroll out (use mouse wheel) until you can see the whole grid. Sometimes you see only black because you are seeing only one portion of the grid
