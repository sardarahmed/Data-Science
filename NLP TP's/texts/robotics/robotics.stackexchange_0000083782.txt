Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Odom and IMU

I am really beating my head hard over this, excuse me while I ask a silly question.
I'm building my own robot using HCSR04 as range sensors and a MPU925 as an IMU, while going through the navigation package, I got really confused with the difference between data/imu and nav_msg/Odometry. How are the related and what do I need to go to get localization working?

Can you be more specific? What does confuse you? And what does the range sensor have to do with odometry in this context?

A:

How are you connecting your IMU to your roscore ?
There is github with relevant code if you are using a raspberry/beaglebone:
https://github.com/vmayoral/bb_mpu9150
If you are using an arduino, then use rosserial and get the data with ROS from there:
