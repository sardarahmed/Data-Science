Q:

In ROS network, when does a topic really transported?

In a ROS system run across different computers in a network, when does a topic really being transported? Let's say in computer A, I publish 100 topics.. Do all the topics transported to all ROS device in the network? Or only the ROS nodes in different computers subscribed to a subset of topics should those subset of topics be transported??
