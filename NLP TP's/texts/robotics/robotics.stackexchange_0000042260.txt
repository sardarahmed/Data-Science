Q:

Could not tap ros/fuerte/flann over mxcl/master/flann

Per the instuction on installing ROS on OS/X
I run
brew tap ros/fuerte

and get this result
Cloning into '/usr/local/homebrew/Library/Taps/ros-fuerte'...
remote: Counting objects: 242, done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (141/141), done.
Warning: Could not tap ros/fuerte/flann over mxcl/master/flann

I am unsure how to troubleshoot this.  What should I try next?

A:

That should not be a problem, this just means when you do brew install flann it will use mxcl/master/flann rather than ros/fuerte/flann.  To install the ros one you would just do brew install ros/fuerte/flann instead.
You can continue with out any worries.
