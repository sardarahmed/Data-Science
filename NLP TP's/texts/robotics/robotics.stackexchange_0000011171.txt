Q:

Intelligent robotic arm and its control system

As I know, most of robotic arms are specific-purpose and usually work under supervision of an expert, such as surgery robot. So, is this relevant for a robotic arm to be intelligent and autonomous? If so, how its control system may be different from non-intelligent ones?

A:

I believe you are only noticing the robotic systems that get a lot of press coverage.   Specialized, supervisory-controlled robotic systems are definitely not the most common.  Check out this list of industrial robotic systems for quantities of general-purpose, reprogrammable, robot systems for comparison purposes.   Whether or not reprogrammable industrial robots are intelligent is a matter of speculation and argumentation.   It depends on your definitions of autonomous and intelligent.
