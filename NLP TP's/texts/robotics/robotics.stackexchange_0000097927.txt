Q:

Doubt in ROS-2 design document about topics

In the ROS-2 design page "https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_middleware_interface.html", it is written by @Dirk Thomas  as

The DDS DataReader and DataWriter as
well as DDS topics are not exposed
through the ROS API.

My question is: How can we say that the DDS topics are not exposed through the ROS API, when using "ros2 topic list", we do access the topics ? Does these topics do not belong to DDS implementation ? What was the actual concept that was meant to be conveyed by the quoted text above ?
I request to help me in clearing this doubt.

A:

What you see in the ros2 topic list are the ROS topics and not the DDS topics. Under the hood it is implemented with DDS by default but the topics are not exactly the same. And you don't have access to the raw DDS DataReader and DataWriter objects.
