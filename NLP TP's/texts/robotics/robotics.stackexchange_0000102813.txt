Question on ROS frame convention

Hello,
I keep getting confused with this every once in a while, and I can't find a definite resource for the convention.
The frame id is supposed to be: #Frame this data is associated with
To represent the pose of an object in the map, I'm not sure what convention is used. i.e.. if the data should be in the frame of object (camera, robot,etc..) or in the frame of the map.  In CV, SLAM literature, the 'pose' represented by a Rotation (R), and translation (t) is usually in the frame of the camera,
i.e. R contains the coordinates of the bases of the map frame in the Camera frame, and t is the translation in the Camera frame, or X_camera = R*X_map + t where X_map is a point in the map frame, and X_camera the same point in the camera frame.
From what I understand, it seems like the the frame_id should be Camera for orientation R (in quaternion) and position (t), and map for orientation inv(R) (in quat) and position -inv(R)*t, but I've lost count of the number of times I've gotten confused with this. Would appreciate it if you could point me to some documentation on this convention.

A:

The documentation for the transform, and pose conventions I was looking for can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Overview/Transformations
tl;dr:

To represent the pose of an object in the map, I'm not sure what convention is used. i.e.. if the data should be in the frame of object (camera, robot,etc..) or in the frame of the map.

For the frame_id of an object map, the data should be in the coordinates of the map, opposite to CV/SLAM convention where a pose of a camera is the coordinates of a map in the frame of the camera.
