Q:

error message when running "Quadrotor indoor SLAM demo"

Hi,
When I tried to run the quadrotor demo here , I got the following error message:

Could anybody let me know how to resolve the error message ?
Thanks~

A:

Most of these errors should be startup artifacts, when not all nodes are running yet. The main problem is that rviz seems to crash when trying to load the .vcg config file specified in the launch file. This seems to happen occasionally for no particular reason in electric. You can restart rviz afterwards and try to manually load the indoor SLAM .vcg config file. You can also just start up rviz and add displays that youÂ´re interested in yourself.

Hi Stefan, Even I do "roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo  indoor_slam_gazebo.launch" with commenting rviz, the above error message comes out. Any suggestion ?
Comment by maruchi on 2012-03-30:
Stefan, Even though I get all the above message, I can see gazebo simulation with rviz, camera view. Is the above message just warning message due to others, for example, no maps or something ?

These errors are just startup artifacts, as the whole tf tree is not yet available and nodes are started in more or less random order. As long as everything settles and works after 1-2 seconds just ignore them :)
