Q:

Design general model inside ignition (Citadel or Fortress)

How do you design models just like this: https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/fuel/models
I wanted to start, but I'm not sure where. I know the cheating way only by using Blender and import it to .DAE or .OBJ. That's it.
How do you guys do this?

Oof! I used Blender and exported .obj AND .dae file format.
Now it couldn't load them. I must have done something wrong. I was able to load dae from this link, but not my own file. This has to be from the program
