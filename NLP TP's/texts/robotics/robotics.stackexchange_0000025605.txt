Q:

Joint Controller Plugin for Gazebo

Hi,
I'm looking for a Gazebo 1.3 plugin that will allow me to send joint commands to my simulated robot arm described in SDF format. Does something like this already exist? The closest thing I've found for Gazebo 1.3 is the "gazebo pid joints" tutorial, but it is a very limited demo and I would need to put in a lot of work to make it into a fully ROS-ready controller for multiple joints. This Controller would be ideal except it has not been ported to the new SDF format and Gazebo version. Its source code is here. This must have already been done though, so I don't want to re-invent the wheel.
Thanks!

I've made a ros_control_gazebo plugin to fix this problem.
