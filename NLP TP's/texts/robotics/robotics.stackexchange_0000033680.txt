Q:

OpenNI Kinect Choosing Subjects for Tracking

Is it possible to modify the openni_kinect code so that you can give a set of coordinates and it will search for people to track between those coordinates? Also, is it possible to modify it so that if something that is not a person is being tracked, you can tell it to stop tracking it? It seems as though the program currently just tracks what it wants to.

A:

The features you talk about are not supported by the openni_kinect stack. It sounds more like an application you want to build using the openni_kinect driver.
