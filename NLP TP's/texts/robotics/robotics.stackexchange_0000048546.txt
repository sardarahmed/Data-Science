Q:

Hokuyo_node with groovy

Hello,
I am trying to use an Hokuyo laser with groovy.
I followed the tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Tutorial/UsingTheHokuyoNode but I have a problem when I want to see the laser scan in Rviz.
The config file /hokuyo_test.vcg was created for fuerte and is not used anymore with groovy. So when I launch Rviz nothing happens.
Any advice ?
Caroline

A:

Just add a Laser Scan display to rviz and select the laser topic.

Thanks for the advice, but the problem is that no topic is available for the laser scan.
Moreover, the frame /laser is not available in Fixed Frame...

That is because no one publishes that. If you just want to look at the laser data, it's OK to manually enter the frame in the fixed frame field.

The problem is solved. For my part, I had to use the topic /scan and not /laser but I entered it in the fixed frame field as you said and it works. Thanks.

Hi I am having the same issue, however when I add "/scan" to the fixed frame, under global options, I am still getting a Global Status warning  "No tf data, Actual error: Fixed frame [/scan/] does not exist"
I know scan is being published as I can stream it over the command line with rostopic

Hi Henry, did you try to manually put /laser in the fixed frame and to use /scan in the topic of the Laser Scan ?
Comment by HenryW on 2013-03-26:
aaaaah woops...had /scan in both, putting /laser in the fixed frame now displays the data. Thank you!

Comment by CarolineQ on 2013-09-08:
If you are using Ubuntu, just do sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-laser-drivers (stack containing hokuyo_node package http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node).
Comment by Hamid Didari on 2013-09-08:
i write "sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-laser-drivers" this error occurd  "Unable to locate package ros-fuerte-laser-drivers"
