Q:

Query the dimensions of a model

Is there a way to get the dimensions of an object in (Ignition) Gazebo? I guess it's solvable by implementing a custom plugin, but are there any simpler ways? Maybe a service i'm missing?
Update:
To clarify, i want to know is the width/height/depth of a model's bounding box downloaded from fuel. I think this is what the ModelPhotoShoot plugin does internally: https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/blob/3bde4b5318f9bed37e2fc8dbe5877bbdc9b73ae1/src/systems/model_photo_shoot/ModelPhotoShoot.cc#L235

Can you explain a little more what you want? An "object" is too vague because it's not clear if you want the dimension of the whole model, just a link, or a single visual/collision in the link.

Thanks! I updated the question. I was thinking the size of a model, but if there is a solution for querying the bounding box of a link, or a part of a link, i'm also very interested.

A:

Gazebo has a bounding box camera sensor. I can't find a tutorial that covers how to use it, but there's an example in gz-sim that you can look at. The camera publishes a vector of AnnotatedOriented[2,3]DBox types, which you can learn about here
