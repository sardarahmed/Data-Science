Q:

rospy logging configuration

The rospy docs mention that from Diamondback on, rospy uses Python's logging library and configuration format.  Two questions about this:

The link in the docs is broken.  Is there an example on the wiki about how to use this?
How do the Python handlers interact with the publication of log messages on /rosout?

A:

The python logging documentation is here:
http://docs.python.org/lib/module-logging.html
Admittedly, it is pretty difficult documentation to wade through and is part of the reason why I want to move away from the logging module.
The logging configuration file does not interact with log messages on /rosout. The /rosout log level can be overridden in the rospy.init_node call.

Right, in particular, the linking text says "this is how your configuration file should look", but the documentation doesn't actually describe the config file format.  Python's logging looks pretty flexible actually, and I think it would be a good solution if 1) there was an example ros-specific configuration file in the wiki docs; 2) there was a unified way of controlling what's printed on the console/what's sent to rosout (i.e., by adding a subclass of logging.Handler).  Overriding things in rospy.init_node is not fine-grained, and it also means the user has to edit a (often version controlled or read-only) source file rather than changing a local config file (or eventually, maybe using a tool such as rxloggerlevel).  My 2c :)
