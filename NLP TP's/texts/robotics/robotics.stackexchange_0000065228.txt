Q:

Limit access to topics?

Is this possible? I have topics that I want to share in my own subsystem, but don't want exposed to external nodes because it's really not data that they should be using.

A:

There is no way to limit access to a specific topic. For this sort of limitation a common approach is to isolate the network with the internal subsystem and run the "public" master and use some of the multi-master tools to expose the specific topics you wish available on the public master.
