Is this Question solved? I've yes please mark the Question as solved or tell us how you solved the Question.
If the Question is not solved yet than tell us what you don't understand.

A:

The apriltag_ros gives you the relative coordinates from the camera to the apriltag. They are also given as tf-frame see tf-package. If you connect your camera-frame with your fixed frame (normaly world or map). You've got your absolut coordinates.
The Z-axis is in the direction of the camera view. X and Y are the other both axis (up and the the right side).
Hope I could help you.
