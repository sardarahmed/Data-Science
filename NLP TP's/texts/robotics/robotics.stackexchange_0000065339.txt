Q:

How does ros create communication between android device and linux pc?

I wanted to know how ros can communicate between an android and pc through an usb device. Looking at the hokuyo code in the android_extras, it implements the USB api, but this USB api is not picking up my linux machine as an usb device. So I wanted to know why the hokuyo code can create an connection between an android device and linux pc only using the usb.

A:

The Hokuyo being used for that has a USB interface.
If you want to talk from a tablet to a PC with ROS you should use a USB ethernet adapter on the android device.
