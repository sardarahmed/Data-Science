Q:

How to Split /cmd_vel into left and right wheel of 2WD robot?

Hi All
Can you please help me writing the equation to split the velocity on left and right wheel of a differential robot from the /cmd_vel?
I want to take smooth turns i.e both wheel should rotate in forward direction but at different speed while taking curves /turns
Equation which I encountered till now simply splits the velocity in which one wheel moves in clockwise
Direction and other anticlockwise while taking turns.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

It sounds like you're actually asking about the kinematics of a differential drive robot.
There are a few Q&As about that already here on ROS Answers. Take a look at #q244540 and the resources linked from that answer for instance.

@gvdhoorn I have seen the post. But unfortunately most of the link for the useful resources are not opening  expect the YouTube video.
Since I have lack of time can please share me link to a blog or documentation from where I can get a good idea.
Thankyou

A:

@gvdhoorn is right, this is a topic with an abundance of documentation in the community and simple geometry.
With that said this is how
vel_l = ((msg.linear.x - (msg.angular.z * self.wheel_bias / 2.0)) / self.wheel_radius) * 60/(2*3.14159)
vel_r = ((msg.linear.x + (msg.angular.z * self.wheel_bias / 2.0)) / self.wheel_radius) * 60/(2*3.14159)

Thanks @stevemacenski. I am noob in this field. Can you tell me the reason of multiplying the equation by (60/(2*3.14))
Comment by stevemacenski on 2019-09-26:
That's conversion between rad and RPM. You dont need that if you dont need RPM

@stevemacenski, for the wheel_bias, does this represent the distance between two wheels?
Thank you very much!
