Q:

$ ROSDISTRO is rolling, although ROS2 Galactic is installed

I have recently installed ROS2 Galactic from source with instructions from the tutorials (https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html)
When I open a new terminal, and run echo $ROS_DISTRO, the variable is empty as expected.
I source galactic's setup file, source ~/ros2_galactic/install/setup.bash, then run echo $ROS_DISTRO.
rolling is printed out in the terminal, whereas it should be galactic, why could this be happening?

A:

Could be because the version of the ros2.repos file those instructions have you download points to master, which makes you download the rolling branch of ros_environment.
Not sure why the documentation tells you to do that.
The Foxy instructions download the foxy version of ros2.repos.
I'd suggest opening an issue on the ros2/ros2_documentation issue tracker. You might even already fix it and submit a PR.

Confirmed that, that is the case. Thanks! I have put a PR up for the fix. (https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation/pull/1693)

@ijnek: I guess this did not solve the problem after all?

@gvdhoorn Apologies, I accidentally unchecked this as the correct answer without realising. Back to correct answer!
