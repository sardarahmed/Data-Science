Q:

AMENT versus COLCON Ignore files

Hello!
I was wondering if AMENT_IGNORE files are still being used. I saw there are still some of them in some packages, like RTI Connext
https://github.com/ros2/rmw_connext/blob/master/rmw_connext_dynamic_cpp/AMENT_IGNORE
Do AMENT_IGNORE still have a purpose since there is COLCON_IGNORE? Or is it something that has not been updated after the release?
Thanks

Since the current ROS 2 releases can be built with both - colcol as well as ament_tools - we kept the AMENT_IGNORE files for now.

Thanks, I did not get that ament_tools was still being used. I though colcon became the new build tool. I guess I misread the release notes :P

colcon is indeed the recommended build tool as of Bouncy. But users are still using Ardent and we didn't want to require them to change their workflow. Also in Bouncy we still released ament_tools for convenience. But future releases won't contain ament_tools anymore.

A:

Colcon always ignores folders containing COLCON_IGNORE. If colcon-ros is installed then it will also ignore folders containing CATKIN_IGNORE or AMENT_IGNORE.
As far as I know ament_tools doesn't support COLCON_IGNORE, so using the AMENT_IGNORE marker file allows building with either ament or colcon.

catkin_pkg (used by ament_tools) considers all three marker files too: see https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/catkin_pkg/pull/226
