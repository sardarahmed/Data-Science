Q:

An incomprehension about geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance Message

Hi, I have a question about pose covariance.
In the doc website (link text), I see the covariance is shown as a matrix with 6*6 size and the parameters are x, y, z, rotation about X axis, rotation about Y axis, rotation about Z axis in order.
I am confused about the size and the parameters. The x,y,z are the coordinate of a 3D point and they are 3 parameters? And then, three rotations are shown in 33 matrix respectively? If it is, the all parameters are 3 + 39 = 30. Why 6*6 here?
Thank you!

A:

It is 6x6 because it is a covariance matrix with the 6 different states ( x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw). The diagonal of this matrix is the variance ( the  "spread" of a specific state, e.g. a high x position variance means it has  a very large spread of values), the other values will be the "covariance" with respect to the other 5 states. If it is a pure diagonal matrix it means there is no covariance between the states.

Thanks for your answer. By the way, I guess that the TwistWithCovariance is about the linear velocity of xyz and the rotation velocity about 3 axes?

Exactly. Just derive everything once.
