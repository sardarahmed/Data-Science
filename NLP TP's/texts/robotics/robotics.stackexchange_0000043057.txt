Q:

rosbag service?

Is there a topic, actionlib, or service interface for controlling the recording of bag files?

A:

Related really old post: http://lists.ros.org/lurker/message/20100624.102701.faa666b4.en.html (was http://ros-users.122217.n3.nabble.com/rosbag-external-control-td920048.html)

I was wondering if there is a way to
make rosbag expose a service to
pause/resume the recording? This would
be quite useful in a data-collection
application we are currently building,
where we don't need to record all the
time, but only on certain segments of
the trajectory.
Any thought on this functionality?
Thanks

Hi Cedric,
Yes, that functionality is on our
roadmap. Until then, you could look to
rosbag/recorder.cpp and
rxbag/recorder.py for implementations
of bag recorders. It should be
straightforward to add service-based
pausing/resuming on top of those.
Fyi, notes on planned future ROS
functionality are kept here:

It's great to get feedback from the
community about what features would be
useful, though.
Thanks, Tim
