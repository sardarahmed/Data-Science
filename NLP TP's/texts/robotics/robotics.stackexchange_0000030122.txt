Q:

In RVIZ, why does the aspect ratio with the top-down view change after a selection

In RVIZ, with the top-down view, the user can resize the window to any format, and the aspect ratio stays constant (i.e. the squares of the grid are always squares). However, after the user tried to select something, the aspect ratio becomes variables. For example, if the window is 1000 X 500, the grid cells are squeezed and they are displayed twice as large as their height.
Why is that? How can I get rid of this behaviour?

This is definitely a bug.  I've opened this ticket https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4858 about it.
