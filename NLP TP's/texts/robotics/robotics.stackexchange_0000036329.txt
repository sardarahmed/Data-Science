Q:

Whether pose values returned by laser_scan_matcher package relative or cumulative

I was referring to a tutorial pertaining to laser_scan_matcher package. Nevertheless, I have one question regarding this package. It publishes pose2D topic which comprises of position(x, y) and orientation(theta).
Are those position and orientation values cumulative or relative? Cumulative in the sense that, if we have 3 state values for one state variable, say x, then, the third state value is actually the result of the integrating those previous two state values. On the other hand, relative, I mean in the sense that the third state value is obtained with respect to the second state value.
Hopefully someone who is familiar with this package can clarify on this.
Thanks in advance.
