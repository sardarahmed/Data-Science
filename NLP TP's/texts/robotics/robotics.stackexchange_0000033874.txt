Q:

can't find packages

I'm new to ROS. I got a project from previous developer and now i'm trying to compile it. the project uses several dependent packages (such as eigen, tf etc.) but it can't find any of them.
I installed ROS according to instructions and I can find these packages in /opt/ros/diamondback/stacks, but when I try to call rosmake or rosdep to any of them it fails to find them.
as I understood it searches in /home/username/.ros/rosmake/ when i call rosmake, which of course isn't correct. Where should I change it?
this is how it reacts to rosmake:

sergey@ubuntu:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/geometry$rosmake tf
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['tf']                           
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/sergey/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-0110825-143550
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['tf'] to: >[]                                                             
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: >['tf']           
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

Thank you

A:

rosmake doesn't search in $HOME/.ros/rosmake. It's just the directory it puts some logs in.
I assume that you are using Ubuntu and installed ros with debian packages. If the system cannot find tf, I suspect that you installed ros-diamondback-base and not the recommended package ros-diamondback-desktop-full. To fix it, just execute the following in a terminal:
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full

If that doesn't help, something is probably wrong with your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. In that case, can you please post the output of
echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
