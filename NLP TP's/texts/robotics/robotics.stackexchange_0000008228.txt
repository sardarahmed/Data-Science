Q:

Quad Copter flight module can replace with smart phone?

I want to replace the flight module with smart phone because it has all sensors that are required, like gyroscope, magnetometer, etc. Is that possible?
I am using an Google Nexus 4 Android (OS model 5.1). I will control using another mobile, I am able write an app, with an Arduino acting as a bridge between smartphone and copter. I am using flight controller OpenPilot CC3D CopterControl.

A project like this was already thought and working. 
It was proposed from Vijay Kumar, one of the gurus of quarotor helicopers (that is the name he thinks it is the most appropriate for these objects).
I hope you will find the following link interesting:

You need to be a lot more specific in your question so you can get a meaningful answer:  

What smart phone are you connecting? Make, model, OS
What flight module are you replacing?
How will you be controlling the smart phone?
Are you able to write an app for the smart phone?
What will happen when the smart phone looses its signal?
How will you connect the phone to the copter?
Why have you tagged this with Arduino?

If you can provide more info then I can provide a more specific answer than: Maybe.
