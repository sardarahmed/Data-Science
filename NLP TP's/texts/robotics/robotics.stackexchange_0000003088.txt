Q:

Different Particle Filter min and max particle numbers give almost the same result

I'm using amcl package in ROS to localize a mobile robot. I've changed min_particles and max_particles several times then calculated the output difference with odomotry to evaluate these parameters. The table below demonstrate results; As you see, there is no notable change in the output and if you ignore the first row of the table, output variance is small. 

And this is the Particle Filter output on the map:

A:

Once you have enough particles to resolve your position, the effect of adding more particles shrinks to zero.  You are likely seeing the best possible results that your particle filter can achieve.
It looks like the smallest adequate number of particles for your simulation is somewhere between 120 and 1200, and my guess is that if you plotted the Odom difference vs max_particles, you would see a curve that was near-vertical at max_particles = 1, decreasing past 172 at max_particles = 120and near-horizontal at 149 by the time max_particles got to 1200.
