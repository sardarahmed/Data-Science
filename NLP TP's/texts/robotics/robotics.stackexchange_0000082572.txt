Q:

Intel Euclid feature access from ros

Hello ROS-Euclid users,
Intel Euclid has everything builtin by default, but do I need to develop my own new ros nodes ?
How can I access all these nice features - any idea where to find examples or detailed specifications ?
Environmental sensors including inertial measurement unit, barometric pressure sensor, GPS, and proximity sensor
Audio:
Low Power, Dual I2S interface, Speaker 1W Mono
Microphone:
D-MIC, X3, Noise Cancellation
GPS:
GNS, GLONASS, Beidou, Galileo, QZSS, WAAS, EGNOS
The basic Euclid software contains pure samples for the camera and basic imu functions only.
Thanks for any hints from advanced Euclid users.
Cheers
Chrimo

I would try Intel forums for any questions regarding the Euclid itself. We can help you with ROS-related questions here, but anything else should go to the forums related to the specific platforms.

Yes, you are completely right, but Intel forums are not very responsible about ros related drivers so far.

A:

I found one hint only:
$sudo sensorhub_client -c list
A binary which is able to fetch some data from builtin sensors.
But no documentation for building own ros nodes which are able to use this data directly :-(
