)
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED

)
include_directories(
${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} & ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
add_executable(vision1 src/vision.cpp)
target_link_libraries(vision1
   ${catkin_LIBRARIES} & ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES}
)

A:

You've specified an ampersand character ( & ) in your include directories and as a library to link to - the linker is simply informing you that it can't find a library named &
You don't need to use the & as a separator when specifying multiple include directories or libraries in CMake - whitespace is sufficient.
(If any of the documentation suggests that you should use & in this fashion, it is wrong and should be corrected)
