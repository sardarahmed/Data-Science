Q:

DRCsim point cloud noise

Hello,
I launched an empty world with Atlas and added the terrain and a few boxes.
When viewing in Rviz, a noisy point cloud is presented (see youtube video).

Questions:
a. Is the noise deliberate?
b. If so, is this the Gaussian noise, what is the variance of the noise, and can the variance be changed?
Thanks,
Oded

A:

Please see the <noise> block in the multicamera definition for per-pixel noise added to each MultiSense head camera.  stereo_image_proc does not inject any additional noise.

I tried removing the noise by rewriting "0.0" in both cameras and compiling and reinstalling, yet the noise was not removed.

Hi odedy86, different stereo vision algorithms produces have different kinds of errors even if you have an ideal camera.  You can look into literatures on stereo algorithm implementation used here (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#stereobm) to understand these errors.
