Q:

reload recompiled controller src with kill and spawn command

Hi,
I found that I can use kill and spawn command to restart the same controller.
That was great command to use.
But how to reload new compiled controller without restart gazebo pr2 simulator?
Thank you~

Hi sam,
The pr2_controller_manager program has a reload-libraries command.  Running it will bring down all of the controllers, reload the libraries (and hence, the newly compiled code), and, if given the --restore option, it will reload your controllers.
Run:
$ rosrun pr2_controller_manager pr2_controller_manager reload-libraries --restore

The current system cannot reload only a single controller.  It must reload all of them.

reload-libraries reloads ALL controllers.

why I only reload the arm controller,but the head will move sometimes (not everytime) when I reload-libraries --restore? Thank you~
