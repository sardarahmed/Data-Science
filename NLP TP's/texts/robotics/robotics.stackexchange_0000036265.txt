Q:

transform Laser Scan To PointCloud

Dear people,
I want to transform laser to point cloud and then see it in rviz.
I have the following code hokuyo_listener_cu.cpp
I have also a tf_broadcaster.cpp that broadcast a transformation from base_link to base_laser.
when I run hokuyo_listener.cpp I get the error:
what():  Frame id /laser does not exist! Frames (3): Frame /base_laser exists with parent /base_link.
Frame /base_link exists with parent NO_PARENT.
Here I have difficulties to really interpret the function
transformLaserScanToPointCloud("base_link", *scan, cloud, tfListener_);
1.-How base_link shall be declare?
2.-and how tfListener_ will get the tf transform?
well, maybe are a very basic questions, but well, I dont get it :) any help will be appreciate it :)

Have you gone through all of the beginner tutorials as well as the tf tutorials?

A:

The error that you are getting says that you are trying to perform a transform to/from a frame that does not exist. This is most likely because your laser topic contains a frame_id named "/laser", but your static transform publisher is publishing a transform from "base_laser" instead. You need to make sure that the frame_id on this incoming message is correct.
The string "base_link" in transformLaserScanToPointCloud is the frame_id that you want to transform the cloud into. This is simply declared by you based on what you want to do. There is no default value.

@acp: If you try to change "base_link" parameter in transformLaserScanToPointCloud function call with the one with "/" (i mean like this "/base_link"), will there be any difference? is it working as well?

Hi, In advance thank you for your advise, I made it work now, I can manipulate every single laser ray position and visualize it in ROS.
