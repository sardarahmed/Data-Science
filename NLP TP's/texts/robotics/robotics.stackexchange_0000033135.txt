Q:

how to rosmake as sudo?

hi guys! I installed openni on a "old" laptop that doesn't support SSE3 instructions. So I did this modification on the CMakeLists.txt but I don't know how to rosmake it to generate the new node. I tried to rename ROS_NOBUILD but when I do rosmake I got this message:
mkdir: impossible create directory "build": Permission denied

thank you!

A:

I assume you installed from .debs. Changing files inside the .debs installed directories is not recommended (as any update at a later date could mess up your install). You should install from source following the directions for your OS and chosen ROS release.
