A:

python code:
import rospy
import actionlib
from move_base_msgs.msg import MoveBaseAction, MoveBaseGoal
...
self.move_base = actionlib.SimpleActionClient("move_base", MoveBaseAction)
...
# Set up the goal location
self.goal = MoveBaseGoal()
self.goal.target_pose.pose = Pose(Point(0.643, 4.720, 0.000), Quaternion(0.000, 0.000, 0.223, 0.975))
self.goal.target_pose.header.frame_id = 'map'
self.goal.target_pose.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()
...
self.move_base.send_goal(self.goal)
