Q:

Package autocompletion not working

Hello everyone,
I am using a minimum set of ROS on an embedded system, with also a minimum set of the setup.sh being executed, concretely:
export ROS_DISTRO=indigo
export ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 
export PATH=$PATH:$ROS_ROOT/bin 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROS_ROOT/lib 
export PYTHONPATH=$ROS_ROOT/lib/python2.7/site-packages
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$ROS_ROOT

I have it running properly. I have installed rosbash and tab completion works ok, although I have to manually source the setup file from rosbash package, following this post  . However, roslaunch completion is not working.
What could I be missing?

A:

I have it working, I was missing the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/indigo/share/
