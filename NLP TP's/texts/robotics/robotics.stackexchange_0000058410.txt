I find the ros_vrpn_client on the wiki page. I want to start the  ros vrpn client, but i get the errror
 /home/dante/workspace/ros/groovy/src/ngadh/src/rosclient.cpp:10:37: serious defect: LinearMath/btQuaternion.h: file or directory  dont found

Please edit your question to contain relevant parts of the code you are trying to compile. Also include the commands your are using to compile and the full output including the error message you are getting.

If you want help, you will need to provide the full output including the commands you executed. Also, include the exact source of where you got your code from. Notice that the wiki page on ros_vrpn_client refers to fuerte, while you are using the newer groovy. So maybe it does not work at all.
