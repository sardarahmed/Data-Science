Q:

I installed ROS melodic for my 18.04 Unbuntu. But I couldnt launch gazebo with the gazebo command

After I typed gazebo and entered, this happened:
gazebo: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgazebo_common.so.9: undefined symbol: _ZN8ignition10fuel_tools12ClientConfig12SetUserAgentERKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE

Looks similar to https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/2448/problem-running-gazebo7 . Try upgrading the libignition-math2 package as suggested on that ticket.

what ended up fixing it for you?

A:

Upgrading the libraries worked for me sudo apt upgrade libignition-math2
