Q:

What is relevant ROS packages for walking quadruped?

I want to design walking quadruped robot with sprawling configuraion using Dynamixel servo. The navigation use SLAM with XV-LiDAR 11 input. I look on the internet and found towr and Moveit! packages seems can handle the kinematic but I am afraid both will overkill because my robot is should be optimized to walk on even surface in a maze. Maybe package with seamless integration with navigation stack, kinematic, and gait will be much better.

@Hatty_pcott, Hi! I still working on the navigation until next three months. I think we should work together. Do you mind to share your robot project specs? feel free to contact me at fathoni.id@gmail.com

@crank yes, but I still focus on robot navigation. I will do more research about this package and tell you the result.

@achmad_fathoni @crank Hey guys, Im working on a quadruped robot too and I have the same question as you, is it better to work with move it or with towr? In any case, do you find a good tutorial that might help me? thanks in advance!
