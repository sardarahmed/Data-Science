Q:

roscpp and latched topics

Hi there,
I have the following problem.
One of my node just parses a file and stream reference trajectories as Path/Markers topics. These trajectories are almost never updated. Therefore I would like to use latched topics to avoid updating for nothing.
Therefore I have the following setup:

parse data, create publishers with latching enabled
publish once in each topic
spin forever

...and if I use rostopic to retrieve the topics data, nothing comes from the node.
Am I missing something?

Could you include your code? (or at least a minimum example that has this issue)

Sorry, it was an error on my side. For the record, here is what I did to switch "normal" topics to latched topics: https://github.com/laas/humanoid_walk/commit/5d02d0e81c1d49c21b6061133865462673ea6762

A:

You might want to try the simpler version of the advertise API You might be having trouble with not setting the other callbacks which you don't appear to use.
