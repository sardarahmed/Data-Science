Q:

Doubt: "orocos+ros realtime?"

Hello i'm trying to create an rc helicopter in a gazebo 9. I am using ros kinetic and orocos-toolchain 2.9 with rtt_ros_integration-2.9. Right now i'm leaving the xenomai part for real hardware.
My doubt is if i use ros along with orocos(xenomai patched) will it be as much hard real time as using orocos alone with xenomai patched orocos?
What i want is hard real time control of the dron movement. What i like about ros is the libraries and tools it provides for robot development like rviz.

A:

Please see some previous questions about this. The situation has not changed much.
See #q191288 and especially #q206052, which links to a nr of other questions about ROS and real-time.

You might also be interested in the presentation by @Jan Carstensen titled "RTROS â€“ A real-time extension to the Robot Operating System" at ROSCon16 (video). That talks about a real-time adaptation of ROS 1, but that has not been released.
