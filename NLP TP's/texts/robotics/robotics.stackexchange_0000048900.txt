Q:

Fingerprint reader and ROS

Hi.
Is there a package or recommended tutorial for using a fingerprint reader with ROS?
I am actually planning to buy this model:

Any info or project example would be appreciated also!
Greetings ROS community.

A:

I'm not aware of anyone using a fingerprint reader yet in ROS.  You will probably need to write a driver, and I suggest making a message to contain the fingerprint information to make communication and storage easier.
(Note: ROS does not use any authentication so it is not recommended for doing anything requiring security.)
