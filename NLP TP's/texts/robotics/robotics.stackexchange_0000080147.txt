Q:

language translation to Spanish?

I am English, and living in Spain where I am starting to work with kids teaching Lego robotics with an established group of eager learners. I would also like to move them onto ROS. I am more than happy to help with translating your docs into Spanish (its also good for me!), but is there a driver to do this already?
Thanks.
