Q:

Octomap Self-filtering

Hi, I'm using UR5 moveit model with a kinect. I followed this tutorial
http://docs.ros.org/hydro/api/pr2_moveit_tutorials/html/planning/src/doc/perception_configuration.html
to add the kinect like a sensor. I add some parameter to do a self robot filter, but when I launch the robot model (roslaunch ur5_moveit_config demo.launch) I get the next error:
[ERROR] [1425487423.826931655]: Transform error: Lookup would require extrapolation into the future.  Requested time   1425487423.780933888 but the latest data is at time 1425487423.751322031, when looking up transform from frame   [forearm_link] to frame [camera_rgb_optical_frame]
[ERROR] [1425487423.827004659]: Transform cache was not updated. Self-filtering may fail.

Anyone know how to solve it?
Thanks.
This is my yaml file:
sensors:
  - sensor_plugin: occupancy_map_monitor/PointCloudOctomapUpdater
    point_cloud_topic: /camera/depth_registered/points
    max_range: 5.0
    point_subsample: 1
    padding_offset: 0.1
    padding_scale: 1.0
    filtered_cloud_topic: filtered_cloud

Have you rectified it???

A:

I faced the same issue while using a depth camera with Mico2 arm. Solved it by following this thread.
I had to remove my binary installation of moveit and use a source version to modify the changes. Eventually, the source codes and header files are already modified in their rep. Additionally, you need to modify your planning_context.launch file and add the wait time as mentioned here.

I was facing the same error while working with intel real-sense depth camera and with my 5DOF arm.
Modified below lines to moveit_config/launch/planning_context.launch file solves problem as suggested by @R@m,
  <group ns="$(arg robot_description)_planning">
    <param name="shape_transform_cache_lookup_wait_time" value="0.1" />
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find thorp_moveit_config)/config/joint_limits.yaml"/>
  </group>
