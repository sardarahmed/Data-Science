Q:

How to set link(end_effector) pose?

Hi, I'm working with the ur10 model and I'm trying to get a way of controlling it by setting a pose for the end-effector. However I have no clue on how to do it. I tried the tutorial of movit regarding kinematics. But in the tutorial they calculate the IK from the value calculated from the DK for the end-effector but I want to set manually the values of the end-effector. So I tried to do the same way as they do for the joints:
kinematic_state->setRandomPosition(joint_model_group);

but had no success in finding a similar function for the links as there are for setting the joint values. Is there any other way I can do this, in order I can manually write the x,y,z values?

A:

You can use the setFromIK method

@jrgnicho that seems the way to go but can you help me here, I defined the pose through geometry_msgs::Pose end target;
but now how can turn it into const Eigen::Affine3d &   pose, as required in the documentation?

There are multiple flavors of that function, one of them takes a geometry_msgs::Pose type.  However if you need to convert between various types within a ROS program you can always use the this conversion utility header
