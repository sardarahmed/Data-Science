Q:

using ros map server with moveit

This question has been asked at the moveit-users mailinglist by Troy Cordie:

I know this is a bit of an odd question considering most users are planning for armed platforms.

I have a mobile base running in moveit and want to plan using a map in a similar fashion to move base. Is it possible to use the ros map server with moveit?

or has anyone tried something similar? i.e. generate an environment for testing?

A:

Not directly.
MoveIt always works with 3D information.
The most straight-forward solution would be to generate an octomap from your 2d-map by projecting all occupied pixels to cuboids of some fixed height and use this octomap to plan.
You could implement a specialized Octomap updater to do that.

Cheers I ended up importing the bitmap into solid works and extruding it to give it depth then saving as an stl to import into moveit.
