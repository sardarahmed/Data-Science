Q:

Invalid GPG ROS melodic Docker image

for a couple of hours, I am getting the following error when trying to build Docker images based on ROS melodic:
3.712 W: GPG error: http://snapshots.ros.org/melodic/final/ubuntu bionic InRelease: The following signatures were invalid: EXPKEYSIG AD19BAB3CBF125EA ROS Spanshot builder <rosbuild@ros.org>
3.712 E: The repository 'http://snapshots.ros.org/melodic/final/ubuntu bionic InRelease' is not signed.

Yesterday everything was working fine, yo, Is this because Melodic is EOL? And if so, is there any way to continue building docker images based on it? Unfortunately, I work with drivers that were developed exclusively for Melodic, therefore not possible to upgrade to other distros. Any help is appreciated.

A:

Cross-reference from docker_images: the key has been updated. In short: update the key in your installations and for new installations do nothings (be careful with your cache).
