Q:

clear the map built by gmapping or restart gmapping by program

I m trying to clear the map previously built by gmapping to build another place's map. I want to clear the map or restart the gmmaping node by computer programs, not manually. How can the map be cleared or the gmapping node be restarted by program?

A:

I think you'll have to do that manually by calling kill/rosnode kill and rosrun/launch. There is no restart functionality for ROS nodes.
