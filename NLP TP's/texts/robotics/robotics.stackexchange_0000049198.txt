A:

Hi,
Yes, ROS_MASTER_URI is your turtlebot laptop ip address. You need to export ROS_HOSTNAME as well in both turtle bot laptop and your workstation laptop. i.e.
Append below statements in your .bashrc file -->

For Turtle bot laptop:

export ROS_MASTER_URI=:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=

For Workstation laptop:

export ROS_MASTER_URI=:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=

Now try pinging one from another.

Run roscore in one and do rostopic list then.

rostopic /echo diagnostics in another one.

It should work. Hope this helps !!
