Q:

publish numpy matrix to topic

Hello together,
I would like to publish a 10x10x10 numpy-Matrix in one publishing step.
Therefore I would like to know how I can declare the numpy.ndarray as a message type like
matrix.msg:

numpy.ndarray  matrix

Is that even possible? What do I have to add to the CMakeLists.txt to get that running?
Is there maybe a better way?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I've tried this before, the simplest way I could find was to put the matrix into row-major order and publish the data as an array. In essence, I just used the Float64MultiArray msg type and filled up that array with the matrix information and then published it. I don't know if there is a way to make a "matrix" msg type that would make this more simple, but this worked for me and I was able to get all the info passed around pretty easily.

Even though I posted the numpy tutorial I do agree that this might be the easiest solution.

Thank you. I will do it like this for now. If I find a different approach I will add an answer here.
