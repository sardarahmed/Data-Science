Q:

asctec_drivers and mav_tools Build errors on Ubuntu 11.04 running ROS

For our pelican running ROS on Ubuntu 11.04, I've got similar errors from building both asctec_drivers and mav_tools from git cloned versions of both pkgs.
Below is the errors after calling  "rosmake asctec_drivers --rosdep-install". Presently I have an impression that it might be an issue of having the right path to pkgs or stacks ? But I still cannot figure this out.
NB: I posted this yesterday at the asctec-users forum before discovering this forum today.

A:

The problem you have is that the package you're trying to build has read only permissions on your filesystem.  If you're using a binary installation you should need to build the package, it's already built.  If you want to modify the package you should be downloading the packages you want to modify from source and adding them to the front of your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
