Q:

How to use Simple_navigation_goals?

I am trying to figure out how to read navigation position of turtlebot in rviz (saved map,or new), and translate that info to write it in the Simple_navigation_goals.cpp. Does the cpp file send a goal similar to the way rviz does in gmapping, or does it just tell it to move forward then move left ..etc . How can I get the turtlebot to draw out a square. And how can I get turtlebot to go to a fixed location ? Thanks --Atom--

@Atom, I am little bit confused with TurtleBot since there are two sources to download package; one is from here https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_apps and other one is https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator. Which one you have used? Which version of ROS and Gazebo are you using?

@ Atom which tutorials you are referring; this one http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TurtleBot or the other one from here  http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator. Can we modify the autonomous behavior in anyone of them?

A:

Are you referring to this tutorial ?
It does send a goal similar to rviz does (to move_base, not gmapping). It does not tell the robot to go forward, left, etc., it just tells it where the robot should end up and lets the move_base node figure out how to do that best.
Going to a fixed location is the intended purpose, just set the fixed location as target pose and give it a the proper frame_id (e.g. map).
As for the example from the tutorial that moves the base 1m forward. It only does that by telling the robot the goal is 1m ahead relative to the robot (i.e. /base_link). Setting the target 1m ahead will usually result in the robot, just driving ahead for 1m, but it doesn't need to do that exactly.
To drive a square, there thus are two possibilities:

Choose the 4 cornerpoints of a square as targets in the map and give those as goals.
Use the "go X meters ahead trick" 4 times, you should also be able to turn 90Â° in the same way.

Thanks for clearing that up for me.. makes sense.

The goal is given with respect to the frame_id given. If it is an fixed frame_id (e.g. /map) it is an x/y goal in the map, if it is relative (e.g. /base_link) it is an x/y goal relative to the robot's current perspective.

Thanks for the reply.. I also was wondering if the goal is set in perspective to the current position, wouldn't that make it hard to write x/y goals intended for a saved map in Rviz (like a kitchen) seeing as turtlebot might start off from various positions with in a map?

@dornhege iis it possible to change the goal your giving? for example i give it the (3,5) and before it arrives send a new goal to (2,4) is it possible? And is it possible to get the position of the robot at a certain time?
