Q:

define ROS_MASTER_URI with an ipv6 address

Hello!
I would like to know if there's a way to define ROS_MASTER_URI with an ipv6 address to use ros on multiple machines.
To be a bit more clear, I have two machines connected via ethernet, and which are able to ssh to one another with ipv6 addresses, using "ssh -6 < address >%eth0"
So, is there a similar way to make ros understand ipv6 adresses concerning ROS_MASTER_URI?
ps: I've already tried "http://< address >:11311" and "http://< address >%eth0:11311" which don't work and return "invalid master URI".

A:

There has been some work on adding IPv6 support to ros_comm in the past (see wiki/ros_comm6 and IPv6 Support for ROS Nodes on ROS news fi), but afaik there is currently no support for IPv6 in any mainline ROS distribution.
I also believe that there are no efforts underway or planned at the moment to add IPv6 support to ROS (1.0).
However, I think that support for IPv6 might be something ROS 2.0 gets 'for free', depending on the DDS vendor chosen. Some vendors already have had support since around 2007 (RTI Incorporates IPv6 Transport to ..). I expect that the relevant ROS tooling / infrastructure bits will also need support, but at least the DDS middleware should be prepared for it.

Hum ok... I'll work with a static IP then, thanks for the heads up anyway!
