Q:

Isn't the hector_quadrotor stack catkinized?

Although the stack (and all the packages) seems to be catkinized I am unable to install the packages. Whenever I run the catkin_make command (after arranging the folder structure for catkin) the devel and install folder are not created.
the terminal output when I run catkin_make is
Base path: /home/saroj/ros/ros_ws
Source space: /home/saroj/ros/ros_ws/src
Build space: /home/saroj/ros/ros_ws/build
Devel space: /home/saroj/ros/ros_ws/devel
Install space: /home/saroj/ros/ros_ws/install

Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/saroj/ros/ros_ws/build"

Running command: "make -j2 -l2" in "/home/saroj/ros/ros_ws/build"

saroj@saroj:~/ros/ros_ws$
(I have just started using ROS (even ubuntu) and I apologize if the question sounds stupid)

What repository / branch have you checked out? Do the directories contain package.xml or manifest.xml files?

I am using tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor repository and hydro_devel branch. The directories do have manifest.xml...

There is your answer: it is not catkinized.

A:

There is a catkinized version of the hector_quadrotor stack now in the catkin branch (forked from hydro-devel):
https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor/tree/catkin
It is still under development and some packages have been reorganized for hydro. There are plans to do some more tests, update the rviz configs etc. and then release hector_quadrotor in hydro, but there was no time for that until now.
We would be glad if you and others can test the catkin branch and report bugs or submit pull requests via the GitHub bugtracker.
