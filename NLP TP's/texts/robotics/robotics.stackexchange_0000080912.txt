Q:

robot_upstart uninstall, Job not found, nothing to remove

Hi, All
I tried to remove the auto start launch file which locates at ~/catkin_ws/src/roscopter/nodes/upstart.launch
After system boot up, "rostopic list" gives a list of topics, which shows the launch file was excecuted.
I used following command to uninstall it
rosrun robot_upstart uninstall roscopter/nodes/upstart.launch

It returns
/lib/systemd/systemd
Job not found, nothing to remove

I tried
rosrun robot_upstart install roscopter/nodes/upstart.launch

it works.
I am confused and have no idea of what's the next step, anyone has ideas?

A:

I had the same problem but it seems the job name is the first part of the apparent package path so for example
rosrun robot_upstart uninstall roscoptor
This worked for me.

The package's document for uninstall confirms this. Format of install and uninstall being different is a bit confusing indeed.
