Q:

household_objects_database returns 3: query error

Hi,
after launching the remote client to the household objects database with
$ roslaunch household_objects_database objects_database_remote_client.launch
(which correctly remaps the services), queries to the database always return a result code 3 DATABASE_QUERY_ERROR, e.g. for the following queries on both cturtle and diamondback.
$ rosservice call /objects_database_node/get_model_list REDUCED_MODEL_SET
$ rosservice call /objects_database_node/get_model_mesh 18800
Has the service definition changed, or is the server down?
best,
Moritz

Hi,
the problem occurred when using the database hosted at Willow Garage, and got solved by Matei who re-started their server :)
Thanks anyway,
Moritz
