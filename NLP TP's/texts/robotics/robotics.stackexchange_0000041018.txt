Q:

image transport using rosbridge

Hello!
What is the best way to transport an image (e.g. .png or .jpg) via rosbridge? Is it possible? What I don't want is, to use an url for a stream, because I need to transport several different images stored on a harddisk.
Thanks for your answers in advance!

What did you call "transport"?.

A:

Take a look at the image_transport tutorials to get an idea of how to move images.

As far as moving the images over rosbridge once you have them published as ROS transports, check out mjpeg_server or the wsview.js script in the scripts directory of rosbridge.
