Q:

how to stop an ubuntu update overwriting my code changes in ros?

sometime i need to change a little in some of the ros packages for my use, e.g. in navfn and move_base. then comes the new ubuntu update and it overwrites my changes! what is the best workaround for this problem? (ofcourse, i need a solution other than not updateing ;)

A:

The easiest way is to do a local (in ~/ros, for example) checkout of a the source code for a particular package, and then (as noted above) make sure it appears before /opt/ros/... in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
But this is not going to generalize well, particularly if you want to distribute your code, because then everybody's going to need your patched version of move_base (or whatever).
If you're finding bugs, send them to the maintainers. Otherwise, a formal fork is going to be a better choice.
