A:

rxbag is, as it's noted on its web site, deprecated since ROS Groovy and taken over by rqt_bag. Thus I highly recommend you switch over to rqt_bag. Some advantages of rqt, the new GUI framework of ROS, are noted here including the availability of sample codes for ROS' GUI applications, which might help you a lot upon your GUI programming.
