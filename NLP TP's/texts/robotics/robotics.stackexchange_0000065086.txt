Q:

apply joint effort service call doesn't do much in gazebo

Hi,
I have a ros node that connects to my gazebo model. It makes a service call to rotate the joints (wheels). If I perform the ros service call from the cmd line I am able to see the wheels move. However, from the cpp node, it doesn't seem to move. Here is my cpp code:
gazebo_msgs::ApplyJointEffort r; 
    r.request.duration = ros::Duration(2.);
    r.request.joint_name = "right_wheel_hinge";
ros::ServiceClient client2 = gazebo.serviceClient<gazebo_msgs::ApplyJointEffort>("/gazebo/apply_joint_effort"); client2.call(r);

I have this in my main function of my cpp file. I am starting with Gazebo, so your help is appreciated

A:

gazebo_msgs::ApplyJointEffort r; 
r.request.duration = ros::Duration(2.);
r.request.joint_name = "right_wheel_hinge";
...

This may just be a copy/paste mistake, but are you setting the effort field of the ApplyJointEffort msg?
If you don't set it, it will initialise to 0, which could be an explanation for what you are seeing.
