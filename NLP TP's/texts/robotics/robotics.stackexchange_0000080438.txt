Q:

ros::serialization::OStream

Is there any standard way of converting ros::serialization::OStream to any standard format like std::string or std::stringstream?

Hi,
I suggest you to take a look to the way it is done in tool_topics:ShapeShifter
http://docs.ros.org/diamondback/api/topic_tools/html/shape__shifter_8h_source.html
I expect the function you want to write to look like this
void copyToString(ros::serialization::OStream& stream, std::string& output)
{
   output.resize( stream.getLength()  );
   memcpy(stream.getData(),  &output[0], stream.getLength());
}

Actually I would like to send the ros::serialization::OStream over a boost::asio::socket, I'm not sure how can I send it through a boost::socket or do I need to transform it in another format...
