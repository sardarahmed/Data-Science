Q:

Gyro measurement to absolute angles

Let us assume we have a gyro that is perfectly aligned to a global frame ($X,Y,Z$). 
From what I know the gyro data give me the angular rate with respect to the gyro axis ($x,y,z$). So let's say I got $\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z$. Since I know that the 2 frames are perfectly aligned I perform the following operations:

$\theta_X = dt * \omega_x$
$\theta_Y = dt * \omega_y$
$\theta_Z = dt * \omega_z$ 

where $\theta_X$ is the rotation angle around $X$ and so on.
My question is: what is this update like in the following steps? Because this time the measurement that I get are no more directly related to the global frame (rotated with respect to the gyro frame).
Thank you!

A:

Your first step works because it is implied that your frames are "aligned", meaning that:
$$
\theta_{X_0} = 0 \\
\theta_{Y_0} = 0 \\
\theta_{Z_0} = 0 \\
$$
In general (as with any integration!), you have some starting angles(initial condition), $\theta_{(X,Y,Z)_0}$, and you proceed to update from there, such that:
$$
\theta_{X_N} = \theta_{X_{N-1}} + \omega_{X_N} dT \\
\theta_{Y_N} = \theta_{Y_{N-1}} + \omega_{Y_N} dT \\
\theta_{Z_N} = \theta_{Z_{N-1}} + \omega_{Z_N} dT \\
$$
Note that when your initial conditions are as you use in your example, the $\theta_{N-1}$ terms vanish leaving you with the equations you originally stated.
