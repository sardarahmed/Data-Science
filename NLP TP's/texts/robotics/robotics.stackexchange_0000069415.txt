Hi, glad to meet you here. I now use amcl too.  I want to build a map using slam_gmapping and amcl. Now, I could run the two node in one launch file. But the generated map is not that good and I could not get the path when moving the rplidar. Could you give me some comments? Thanks!

but you need to ask a new question on forum. your issue is not dealing with this topic. I wrote a node for rplidar odometry path using visualization marker tools. Its not important thing.

A:

I solved my problem.  reflected light from the window caused the problem. because my area ground type is tire and light reflect from ground to lidar. and lidar can not see walls. so my map is not correct. amcl lost its position for this reason.
