I tried changing the rviz 'Global Options' 'Fixed Frame' to my_frame. but nothing happened. I tried to run the command below too, but nothing changed too
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 /map /my_frame 10

the terminal doesn't show any other error.

A:

Try changing the rviz  'Global Options' 'Fixed Frame' to my_frame.
In the tutorial you are sending the markers position in the frame my_frame, but rviz is set to display map, and if you have not set any transforms to connect the frame map to my_frame  rviz can't calculate the markers position in the map frame.
And you need to add a markers display to rviz (maybe you have already done this, but i can't see it in your  screenshot).
Just follow the Tutorials Point '5. Viewing the Markers'.
To change the Fixed Frame:
Open rviz, klick on map (on the text next to Fixed Frame) and just type the new frame name my_frame.
I thought i could choose the frame from a list, but i just built the tutorial program and tried it, but i had to type the name my_frame.
Rviz is often hiding (or it is not recognizable) that you can edit a parameter like Fixed Frame.
I think you are trying to change the Fixed Frame in Global Status, where you get the warning message. Try changing the Fixed Frame under Global Options.

Marker Status is OK. Marker Topic is visualization_marker . But I don't understand how to modify Global Status-Fixed Frame to my_frame.

As soon as i type my_frame and press enter, the text goes back to No tf data.  Actual error: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist
