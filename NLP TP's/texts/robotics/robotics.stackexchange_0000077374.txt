Q:

synchronization of two image topics (infrared stream)

Hi all,
I would like to sync the left and right infrared image topic  from my Intel RealSense R200 camera. Currently, I have managed to subscribe to the individual infrared topic (left and right) with its camera info through using image_transport::CameraSubscriber.
My next goal would be to sync and publish both the left and right infrared stream as well as their camera info. How do I go about achieving the goal? Is it through using image_transport::SubscriberFilter ?

A:

Is it through using image_transport::SubscriberFilter ?

Yes. From the documentation you linked:

This class wraps Subscriber as a "filter" compatible with the message_filters package. It acts as a highest-level filter, simply passing messages from an image transport subscription through to the filters which have connected to it.

You should then be able to use the ExactTime or Approximate Time policies from message_filters to synchronise your topics.
