Q:

Atom + linter-clang

Trying to run linter-clang in Atom on some C++ files is running into trouble because it can't find the header files.
I notice that in Dirk's Atom Settings that he plugged at ROSCon, there are many ROS header include folders listed manually as part of the settings for clangIncludePaths.
What are the appropriate directories to list here, given that I'm using ROS 1.0/indigo and catkin-tools?

A:

Listing /opt/ros/indigo/include should be sufficient to get the system installed ROS packages (see the Kinetic line my config: https://gist.github.com/dirk-thomas/45a47f4de7f2e6d6f18d#file-settings-json-L224).
Additionally you want the include folders from your workspace(s). Depending on how you build your workspace(s) that might become more effort. If you always install into a single location (merged install space). you just add that one too: e.g. ~/ws/install/include. If you install into package specific paths you will need to enumerate them all, e.g.:

~/ws/install/pkgA/include
~/ws/install/pkgB/include
...

And in the case you don't install at all you will have to specify potentially two paths for each package: one pointing to the include folder in the source space and another pointing to the include folder in the devel space.
