Q:

displaying the robot's actual trajectory in RViz

Hi all,
I have a mobile robot which is navigating around a room, I already have the map of the room. I am using rotary encoders for odometry. I am fusing the data from Rotary encoders and IMU using robot_pose_ekf. I am using amcl for localization and move_base for planning with SBPL Lattice Planner as the global planner and Trajectory Planner as the local planner.
Now when I run RViz, I can visualize the global plan (desired trajectory) generated by move_base but I would also like to visualize the actual trajectory (based on odometry data and amcl) followed by the robot in RViz. I want to do this so that I can see how much is the actual trajectory different from the desired trajectory. Is there any package in ROS which does this (I am not able to find any such package)? If not, what is the best way to visualize the robot's actual trajectory in RViz? Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

A:

hector_trajectory_server does what you request. See also this other older Q/A.  :)
