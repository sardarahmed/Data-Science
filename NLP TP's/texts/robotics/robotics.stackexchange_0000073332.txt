Q:

Confusion about navigation and navigation experimental

Hi together,
I am pretty new to pathplanning and navigation in general and especially with ROS.
So for now my goal is to use the SBPL_Lattice_Planner as global planner and another planner as local planner.
My problem is that I downloaded the sbpl lattice planner fork from TU-Darmstadt and built it in my workspace with the sbpl package, which I got from here. (see below for "full" workspace configuration)
After struggling with it for I while, I noticed that the sbpl planner is included in the navigation_experimental package. So do I have to use the experimental package? Or is it possible to get it to work as I configured my workspace?
My workspaceconfig looks like this:

catkin_ws

src

navigation
my_robot_2dnav
sbpl
sbpl_lattice_planner

and I am trying to get the planner to work with the following lines in my move_base.launch:
<param name="base_global_planer" value="sbpl_lattice_planner/SBPLLatticePlanner" />
<param name="SBPLLatticePlanner/planner_type" value="AD*" />
<param name="SBPLLatticePlanner/primitive_filename" value="/home/aschultz/temp_ws/src/sbpl/matlab/mprim/pr2_all_2.5cm_20turncost.mprim" />

Is this all the right way to go?
Thanks in advance :)

A:

navigation_experimental just grouped a bunch of other packages, where some depended on each other. If you managed to compile your SBPL_Lattice_Planner without errors, it should work without the need of the navigation_experimental metapackage.
use the command  rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core to verify which planners you have available to work with.

rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core
sbpl_lattice_planner /home/aschultz/temp_ws/src/sbpl_lattice_planner/bgp_plugin.xml

It seems it is in the list. So it means I am able to use it. I the move_base.launch correct?
Thanks for your help!

I've never used that planner, so I cannot tell it for sure, but it seems correct to me. You definitely have  the plugin available, so give it a try!

Okay but when i look at rostopic list I just see my local planner and this output /move_base/NavfnROS/plan which is a global planner I guess. But the output of  rostopic list should also outout something from sbpl isn't it? As it should provide a global plan topic.

this is only a visualization topic, although it's weird that you are seeing it. Not sure if sbpl also publishes such a topic.... can you post your complete launch file and config files, please?

Hey, sorry for the late answer. The problem was, a wrongly sourced workspace :/ Thanks for your help!!!
