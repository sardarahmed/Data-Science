Q:

What's the difference between PlanSys2 and Moveit Task Constructor

Hi guys. At the moment I want to use one of these tools to write a task scheduler for my robotic system. But let's imagine that MTC is already ported to ROS2 and still. Can the MTC be used as a PlanSys2 subroutine or should they be viewed as competing tools.
P.S. If the question is not clear, I will reformulate
