Q:

Use different LaserScan source for obstacle avoidance

Is it possible to use different LaserScan source for obstacle avoidance? In my robot model I have several laser scanners installed and want to use one for navigation and the other one (possible more than one) for obstacle avoidance. I am using ROS Indigo and Kinetic with standard navigation stack.

A:

Yes.
In the costmap configuration you can specify the observation_sources, where you can choose a different topic.
Look under the costmap configuration section here:  http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup.
