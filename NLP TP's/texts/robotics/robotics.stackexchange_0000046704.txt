Q:

Navigation Stack's Global Planning Algorithm

What kind of algorithm is used for global planner?
I've already read a paper on nav stack, "The Office Marathon".
The paper says that global planner assumes that A* algorithm is used.
And it also refer to a paper "A gradient method for realtime robot control".
Once I asked a similar question and got the latter method is used as global planner.

A* algorithm is used for ... what ?
Thanks in advance.

A:

By default, the navigation stack's global planner (provided by the navfn package) uses Dijkstra's algorithm. See http://answers.ros.org/question/28366/why-navfn-is-using-dijkstra/ for discussion on why that is the case and some more info about the A* implementation available in that package.

Thank you. I read source code and confirmed the algorithm.
