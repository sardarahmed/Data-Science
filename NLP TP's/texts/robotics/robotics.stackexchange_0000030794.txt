Q:

allow gripper collision on the PR-2

I want to allow the PR-2 gripper to collide with objects on a table.  I am designing linear pushing motions.  I am using motion_planning_msgs/CollisionOperation message in the MoveArmGoal message, but it does not seem to work.
Here are the message definitions.  I use their example of object1 = "gripper" and object2 = COLLISION_SET_ALL.  Any suggestion will be very helpful!
# A definition of a collision operation
# E.g. ("gripper",COLLISION_SET_ALL,ENABLE) will enable collisions 
# between the gripper and all objects in the collision space

string object1
string object2
string COLLISION_SET_ALL="all"
string COLLISION_SET_OBJECTS="objects"
string COLLISION_SET_ATTACHED_OBJECTS="attached"

# The penetration distance to which collisions are allowed. This is 0.0 by default.
float64 penetration_distance

# Flag that determines whether collisions will be enabled or disabled for the pair of objects specified above
int32 operation
int32 DISABLE=0
int32 ENABLE=1

Hi guzza,
If i remember well, for the pick action, the motion to the pre-grasp is planified with collision detection. But the last trajectory segment, from pre-grasp to grasp position, is made without collision detection.
I would suggest you to adopt the same approach: go to a pre-push position with a collision aware method and then switch to a non-collision-aware movement.
For how to do this last operation you can take a look at this tutorial.
Hope this helps,
Guido
