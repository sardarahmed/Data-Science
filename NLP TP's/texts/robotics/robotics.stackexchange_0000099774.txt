Q:

proper guide to adding a gripper to my robot in rviz2 and moveit2

im currently running ros2 on foxy and using this driver for the UR10e https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver/ which works perfectly fine, but now im trying to add a gripper to this setup to properly control everything with moveit2. I have assembled my own action server for the gripper. The gripper i have is the Robotiq Hand-E.
Unfortunately I dont know where to start with adding the gripper to my virtual setup.
Do I have to rewrite all urdf and srdf files?
I would greatly appreciate it if someone could guide me through the process

Hello @takti,
do you mind sharing the action server that you have created. it would be really helpful if you can provide me with it as I am new to ROS and cannot find any gripper that can be controlled using ROS2 or has a dedicated ROS2 driver. Please do let me know if it is possible for you to share the action server with me :)

A:

Hello @takti,
You just have to add in your URDF including your link, join. Then you have to upload that urdf file into your moveit and configure your gripper into the moveit.
