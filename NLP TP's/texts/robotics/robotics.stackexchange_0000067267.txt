Q:

Rviz error skipping XML document

Every time I load Rviz, I see exactly four of these errors in my console:
[ERROR] [1430107225.314958023]: Skipping XML Document "/opt/ros/indigo/share/rviz_backdrop/plugin_description.xml" which had no Root Element.  This likely means the XML is malformed or missing.

No file called /opt/ros/indigo/share/rviz_backdrop/plugin_description.xml seems to exist, even though I have all the ros-indigo-rviz-* packages installed.
Is this anything I should be concerned about? How do I fix it?

A:

No file called /opt/ros/indigo/share/rviz_backdrop/plugin_description.xml seems to exist, [..]

And that I think is the problem.
The error message is slightly confusing - but logical - in this case: internally, the XML document is empty (as it doesn't exist), causing the parser to assume it's malformed (as no elements includes no root element).
You don't mention it, but if you installed rviz_backdrop (part of pr2_hack_the_future) from debs, then looking at the CMakeLists.txt it seems the rviz_backdrop package doesn't correctly install all its non-executable assets (ie: there is no install target for the plugin_description.xml file).
If you didn't install from debs, but ran catkin_make install on the workspace containing the pr2_hack_the_future packages, the result would be the same.
If you don't need the rviz_backdrop plugin, you can ignore this warning (the plugin will just not be found).
In any case, reporting this to the pr2_hack_the_future/issues tracker would be the best thing to do, so the maintainer can fix the build script.

I did install everything from deb, including rviz_backdrop, but still get the error. How do I install the media? Shouldn't that have been included in the deb?

How do I install the media?

This is just a single xml file, no 'media' involved. Either copy the plugin_description.xml to the share/rviz_desktop directory by hand for now, or build everything from source. In any case, log an issue with the maintainers.
