Q:

Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros2_control.so: libgazebo_ros2_control.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. I'm trying to spawn my robot in gazebo. The world is loaded successfully but model of robot itself is not and I have following error in terminal.
[gazebo-1] [Err] [Plugin.hh:212] Failed to load plugin libgazebo_ros2_control.so: libgazebo_ros2_control.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[spawn_entity.py-4] [INFO] [1669073669.505081456] [urdf_spawner]: Spawn status: SpawnEntity: Successfully spawned entity [minicar]
[INFO] [spawn_entity.py-4]: process has finished cleanly [pid 10576]

I've installed my gazebo with ros2 foxy using desktop installation, after receiving this error first time I checked if this file can be found in /opt/ros/foxy/lib folder and there are no such file. I reinstall gazebo with following command
sudo apt install ros-foxy-gazebo-pkg

Didn't work ether. If first and last time than I launched it environment has been sourced with:
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash 

so I, honestly speaking, have no idea where the problem can be. Appreciate any help.
