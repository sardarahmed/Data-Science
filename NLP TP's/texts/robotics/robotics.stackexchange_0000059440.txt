Q:

Resolution problem at SBPL Lattice planner

I would like to try the SBPL Lattice planner on my map, but I have problems with the resolutions (scalling). My map.pmg has a resolution of 0.05, and in the SBPL Lattice planner is the resolution 0.025. Where can I change that to 0.05?

A:

The SBPL resolution is specified in the primitives file; you'll have to update the code that generated the primitives (usually a matlab program) to use a different resolution, and re-generate your primitives.
