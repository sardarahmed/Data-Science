Q:

Two machines one ROS master connection rejected

Hi,
I am trying to view Kinect data in RVIZ on a remote client in ROS. I have exported the ROS_MASTER_URI to set to the machine with the roscore running but it won't send back any data. Rviz gives this error:
[ WARN] [1427845377.406032758]: ROS_HOSTNAME / ROS_IP is set to only allow local connections, so a requested connection to 'lukas-Inspiron-N7010' is being rejected.

How can I fix this? Both machines are running Ubuntu 14.04 with Indigo. I followed this tutorial and I couldn't get them talking to each other although I can see the topics being published with rostopic echo. All help is appreciated.
Thanks,
luketheduke

Have you set  ROS_IP to the IP of the interface connected to the other computer?

So if bot is the computer I am running the roscore on, I should set the ROS_IP of the other computer to that of bot?

No. Set it to the IP of your computer.

OK! That clarifies it. I'll try it soon here when I get a minute. Another quick question: do I have to set these every time I boot or are they saved?
Thanks,

A:

Set the environment variable ROS_IPon your machine to the IP of your computer.
If you have more than one network interfaces take the interface that connects to the network of the robot.
If you want to set this variable persistently append the export statement to your .bashrc.

This doesn't work for me. I have a robot at 192.168.0.1 (with rosmaster running) and a laptop at 192.168.0.222. They can ping and communicate successfully
Robot has variables: ROS_IP=192.168.0.1 and ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.0.1:11311
Laptop has variables: ROS_IP=192.168.0.222 and ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.0.1:1311
But when launching rviz I also get [ WARN] [1573849670.099213432]: ROS_HOSTNAME / ROS_IP is set to only allow local connections, so a requested connection to '192.168.0.1' is being rejected.
