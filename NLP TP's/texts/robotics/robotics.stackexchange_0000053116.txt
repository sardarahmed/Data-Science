Q:

Catkin Eclipse Integration (Type 'sensor_msgs::PointCloud2' could not be resolved)

I am trying to use Eclipse with Catkin. I am having some problems with Index, for example, I have just tried to do this tutorial and Eclipse does not recognizes the index to "sensor_msgs::PointCloud2" (all these type).
I am able to compile the package into Eclipse(CTRL+B), it is working fine, my problem is with the Eclipse indexer.
My steps to make Eclipse compile catkin projects were:
cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_ECLIPSE_MAKE_ARGUMENTS=-j8
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ eclipse

File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace...
When I open the .cpp file, I got some errors:
Type 'sensor_msgs::PointCloud2' could not be resolved
Type 'sensor_msgs::PointCloud2ConstPtr' could not be resolved
            ...

But, how I said, I`m able to compile the package, I just have NOT the indexes for this type.
Can you guys help me to make Eclipse index this?

A:

I've had this problem a lot (using rosbuild, not catkin) when the Eclipse C++ indexer ran out of memory while indexing and crashed, leaving a bad index behind. Increasing the memory available to the Java VM by adding -vmargs -Xmx1500m to the eclipse call helped.
