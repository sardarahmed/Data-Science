Q:

How to launch rviz2 using urdf like urdf_tutorial of ROS1

Hello.
I want to make my robot arm with to use urdf on ROS2.
However, I can't find lanch file like urdf_tutorial of ROS1 and use rviz from command line with urdf.
I know that ROS2's launch file is writen by python but urdf_tutorial of ROS1 is written by XML file.
In addition, I know  ROS2'launch is beta vertion.
How do I do ?

A:

The urdf tutorial of ros1 gives you a node that let's you view your urdf file, yes?
I was able to view my urdf file by running rviz2:
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 

and then adding a RobotModel plugin, and setting the Description File variable to the path to my urdf file.
Then I saved off this .rviz file and launched rviz with it in the future with the command:
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d *path/to/rviz_config_file*

Just a note to the last command; it should be:
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d path/to/rviz_config_file
... not urdf_file.
