Q:

Why Euler Angle is set to be in ZYZ order?

We have 3 DOF for rotation in 3D space. So to describe an arbitrary rotation, we need to describe its 3 DOF. Euler angle does this by dividing a rotation in 3 steps, first rotate along the Z axis of the world frame ($z_0$), then rotate along Y axis of current frame ($y_1$), and finally rotate along the Z axis of the current frame($z_2$).
And of course we have other conventions like z-x-z, x-y-x, y-z-y, x-z-x, y-x-y.
And my question is, why the euler angle is define in this "ZYZ" manner? Why the first and third rotation are about the same axis (of course the first Z and the last Z are in different frames) ? Why not to use ZYX?

A:

Euler angles are not always consistently defined as ZYZ.  But this convention is common in robotics because many six-axis robotic manipulators have their fourth axis as a rotation about the forearm, then the fifth is a pitch about the wrist center, and then a final rotation along the Z axis of the end effector.   It maps most closely to the physical devices.
