Q:

Package ros-hydro-pr2-common missing?

Hello,
I'm working through this Gazebo tutorial, and I get to the point where we're told to do

sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pr2-common

However, apt-get comes back with "E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-pr2-common". I'm running Indigo on Trusty, so I took a shot at

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pr2-common

with the same result. My ros-latest.list points at

deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main

It would seem that pr2_common just isn't there. I was able to build pr2_common from source (after chasing down ivcon and convex_decomposition), but I'm still wondering why apt-get couldn't find this package. Makes me think I've got something goofed-up in my setup.
Thanks,
Rick

A:

There's nothing wrong with your system; the PR2 packages haven't been released into Indigo yet. You'll have to install them from source.
You can check the build and release status on the Indigo Status Page
