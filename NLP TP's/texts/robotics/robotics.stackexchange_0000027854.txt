Q:

World changes not saved after editing in gazebo_ros (2.2.3)

I'm working in ROS (Indigo, Ubuntu 14), starting gazebo 2.2.3 with
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

I go in and create a little corner of a room by dropping in a couple of cubes and scaling them:

I save the file as corner.world. Then later open it, and the scaling I did is gone:

I've now just got two cubes. Where did the walls go?
I just cross posted this here:

A:

There were a few issues scaling shapes and saving the world which have been fixed in newer versions of Gazebo. Since Gazebo 2 is no longer officially supported, I suggest you change to the latest long term support version, Gazebo 7.

Unfortunately this is what is built-in with ros, and gazebo 2.N is stuck with Ros Indigo (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_wrapper_versions).  I a noob to Linux, Ros, and Gazebo, and while it is possible to upgrade to more recent, it won't be natural and you have to do work to make it work. Which will basically put me in install hell with 95% probability. Thanks for your answer.

My workaround in the time being will be to build walls out of cubes. Not sure why they have it this way--having what is basically an obsolete version of gazebo installing with an actively supported version of ROS? Oh well... [mustn't rage quit ROS, mustn't rage quit ROS....]
