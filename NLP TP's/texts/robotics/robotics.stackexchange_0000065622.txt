Q:

[Beginner] About running a package like a node

Hi i am stuck because of this, yesterday i ran the HelloWC (not following the name for files convention) and it works, today i try to recompile it and run.... but this is the ouput:
####
#### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/robot/Desktop/package_2/build"
####
####
#### Running command: "make -j4 -l4" in "/home/robot/Desktop/package_2/build"
####
[ 50%] Built target HelloWC
[100%] Built target HelloWC_node
robot@ASHROCK:~/Desktop/package_2$ rosrun HelloWC HelloWC_node
[rospack] Error: stack/package HelloWC not found
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named HelloWC_node below 
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   ./src/HelloWC_node
[rosrun]   ./devel/share/HelloWC_node
[rosrun]   ./devel/lib/HelloWC_node
[rosrun]   ./devel/lib/HelloWC_node/HelloWC_node
[rosrun]   ./build/HelloWC_node
[rosrun]   ./build/HelloWC_node/catkin_generated/stamps/HelloWC_node
robot@ASHROCK:~/Desktop/package_2$

Why is this going on?
(i ran the source devel/setup.bash and it remains equal)
Thanks before hand!

A:

I believe your package is also named HelloWC_node, not just HelloWC.
