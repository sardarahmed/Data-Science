Q:

How to get values orientation of end effector pose?

The first, I am so sorry because my english is not good.
Next, I'm working with robot arm 5DOF. I want to move end effector pose. i can move along x y z asix but i dont know how to get values orientation of eef?
i got pose with getCurrentPose() and maybe i can get orientation with getCurrentRPY()???

A:

I solved it!
I used " std::vector orientation = move_group.getCurrentRPY(); " to get vector 3 elements roll pitch yaw. After that convert RPY to Quaternion and set this values to target_pose.

Wouldn't just looking up the TF to your EEF's frame get you this information? That would immediately be in a format that would be usable.

Would you know how to lookup a transform?

No, I do not know. TT

Then I would suggest to do the TF2 tutorials. The 3rd one ("writing a TF listener") should clarify things for you.
