Q:

error while running roboearth on groovy

So I am trying to run roboearth_stack on ros-groovy, ubuntu 12.04 lts machine without much success. Though I have tried it earlier on fuerte and it works perfectly, I am not too sure if its possible to run it on groovy. Has anyone tried it yet?
This is the output of rosmake roboearth:

I my opinion the problem is with roboearth packages as they mainly support ros- fuerte, so my question is, will these packages run in groovy?if yes, how? and If not, is there any other way to run roboearth in ros-groovy?
I would be happy to provide any other detail regarding this issue.
Thank you.

A:

There are a number of different issues involved in running the roboearth_stack package on ROS Groovy. I wrote down the solution to most of them here, and even though it might not be complete, it should address quite a lot of the known problems.

Thank you for your reply and for addressing the problem of roboearth with groovy. I will try to follow your solution and then discuss further.

Just wondering whether you managed to get roboearth stack to work with groovy?

I linked my solution in the response, the procedure is a bit messy but it works.
