Q:

how to use nav2d with my own lidar and slam algorithm?

i'm trying to do  this job,here is the scene:
I want to take my lidar move around a house ,and i hope nav2d could give me a path about how to move to the most proper frontiers,my slam algorithm is cartographer not karto.
now i've already run the tutorial3.launch,but i still don't know how to achieve it with my own lidar and slam algorithm...for example i don't know how to modify tutorial3.launch to make it work.

A:

You actually just have to replace the Karto-Mapper with your own mapping algorithm. Make sure that your mapper provides the map via a service of type GetMap, so that the navigator can use it to plan exploration on it.
