Q:

How to promote questions/get answers?

I wasn't sure if this is the right place to ask this question. So feel free to delete it if not appropriate, sorry about that.
Anyway my question is, is there any way to get answers to unanswered questions that are lost in the website. Like maybe some way to promote the question or send it to people experienced in that area so we can get answers quicker.
Thank you very much.
Update:
Updating helps to promote the question but I wish that was the same for comments too. Since currently comments are only notified to the person who wrote the original answer and doesn't promote the question on the homepage.
Also, I don't think people up-voting a question has any effect on its visibility?

Comments notify everyone that somehow interacted with the question besides just viewing it.

A:

You can update a question, so it will be again on the first side and no longer "lost".
But you should add more information with the update or rephrase the question. There is a reason why the question remains unanswered.
