Q:

scale problems with gazebo

Hello,
The model that I import as stl from SolidWorks is scaled in mm. When I visualize the model in gazebo itÂ´s awfully huge. So I use Meshlab to rescale it.
However, upon launching gazebo dies instantly with the following error:
[gazebo-2] process has died [pid 5687, exit code -6].
log files: /home/fxm-lc/.ros/log/48312cc6-6942-11e1-84ee-c8600006c2de/gazebo-2*.log
Any suggestion are welcome, thank you very much.

A:

While opening and re-saving is a feasible approach most of the time, it can occasionally lead to problems, like properties getting lost in the process (or even crashes, sometimes). Have you tried the scale tag as described here? If you're talking about gazebo .world files, these also support scaling the mesh.
