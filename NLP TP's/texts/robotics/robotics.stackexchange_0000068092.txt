Q:

Overload << operator for msg

Hi,
Simple and maybe stupid question, but is it possible to overload the << operator for ROS messages? When a message is generated this operator is automatically overloaded for them, but I would like to change the way they are printed for plotting purposes.

A:

The C++ compiler only allows one operator overload for each method signature.
If you want to print your messages in a plot-friendly format, you can write a function that converts messages to custom formatted strings, and print those.
You should also investigate the -p option to rostopic echo, to see if it can do what you need: rostopic echo -p /my_topic

I see. I didn't know it was not possible to overload an operator again. The -p option seems useful, but I'm writing my results to a file so I can't use that now. I guess I'll just convert the messages using a function, thanks.
