Q:

wstool user and password

I want to use wstool on private git repos. But for some reasons (shared computer), I have to clone over HTTPS. It is quite annoying to type my username and password everytime I do wstool up. Is there anyway I can type it only once evertyime I want to update repos?
Thanks!

A:

You can use the ssh version of the git url in your rosinstall file, for example https://github.com/wjwwood/serial.git would become git@github.com:wjwwood/serial.git.  This will use your ssh keys. If you're on a shared computer and can't put your ssh keys on it (which is what you've described) then you can use git-credential cache to "save" your user name and password for a short time:

wstool does not store your password or ask for it on principal to avoid any security concerns. You can also setup a .netrc file, but that's not generally a good idea, especially on a shared computer, since it stores your password in plain text.
