Q:

Bundling a message stream

I am looking to 'bundle' a stream of ROS messages (on different topics) into a single message that contains bundles (i.e. tuples) of the individual message. Is there a package out there that does something similar?
To give a concrete example, I might have two topics A and B that publish messages at possibly different rates (horizontal space is time):
A: a_1,     a_2,      a_3, ... 
B: b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6, ...

and I want a single stream of tupled message bundles:
Bundles: (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_3), (a_3, b_5), ....

For example, these could be stereo image pairs or pairs of sensor data measurements.
Before I write a solution, does someone know if such a bundler package exist?

A:

Have a look at the message filters: http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters
and especially this one

And a link to the parent message/filters page, which is slightly more generic.
