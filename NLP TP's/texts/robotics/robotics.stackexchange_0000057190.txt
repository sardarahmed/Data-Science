Q:

Install catkin package from source (smach_tutorial)?

Hi there,
I'm having quite a bit of trouble understanding how to get a package installed via catkin. I am hoping to run through the smach tutorials - and this seems to necessitate install the smach_tutorial package. I've noticed that this package is not available via apt-get, I found the source and have checked it out with svn.
When trying to run catkin_make within the directory I am presented with:
"The specified base path "/home/frontier/catkin_ws/src/smach_tutorials/src" contains a CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace"
So I followed the ROS catkin tutorials, created a workspace, and created a package for the smach_tutorial. I then added the svn source to the src directory in this package and ran catkin_make install from my workspace. I was presented with:
"Install the project...

-- Installing: /home/frontier/catkin_ws/install/share/smach_tutorials/package.xml"

I feel as though there is something obvious that I am missing. Is there a good example on downloading the source for a catkin package and installing it?
Thanks.

I'm not quite sure I understand the question. What are you expecting catkin_make install to do?
Comment by evk02 on 2014-02-11:
It looks to me everything works just fine, based on the logs you referred you are installing smach_tutorial.

A:

Based on your note about:
"The specified base path "/home/frontier/catkin_ws/src/smach_tutorials/src" contains a CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace"

I think you are executing catkin_make in the wrong directory, you should be in "/home/frontier/catkin_ws" when executing catkin_make.
