Q:

Manually modify Code API pages?

I thought that there would be cases where sharing internal design docs (UML diagrams etc.) is beneficial to the future developers (or even to users?). But wiki pages (ros.org/wiki/$TOOL_HOME$) might be better saved for how-to-use explanation rather than internal implementation description. Code API pages (ros.org/doc/groovy/api/$TOOL_HOME$/html) seem perfect place, but is there a way to manually update API pages (via web browser like wiki)? I've seen this thread that says API pages are autogenerated from code documents but haven't found anything that answers my question. Being able to modify the page layout helps particularlly when I want to paste images.

A:

The API documentation comes from doxygen, sphinx or epydoc inside each package. See the rosdoc_lite documentation for how to enable each of these documentation methods.  The default is mainpage.dox which is generated by ros_create_pkg.
