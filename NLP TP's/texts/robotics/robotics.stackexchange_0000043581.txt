Q:

Problem to start roscore on ARM + Ubuntu 12.04

Hi there,
I installed ros fuerte from source on a new installation of Ubuntu 12.04.
When I want to run roscore i get following failure message:
 ... logging to /home/panda/.ros/log/4b069fea-efbf-11e1-b011-2e607c264e01/roslaunch-panda-1813.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/bin/rosversion", line 5, in <module>
    pkg_resources.run_script('rospkg==1.0.6', 'rosversion')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 499, in run_script
    self.require(requires)[0].run_script(script_name, ns)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 1229, in run_script
    raise ResolutionError("No script named %r" % script_name)
pkg_resources.ResolutionError: No script named 'rosversion'
Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion ros] returned with code [1].

Param xml is <param command="rosversion ros" name="rosversion"/>

I saw that there was already a question regarding to this kind of failure. So I deleted all rospkg regarding folders under /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ and used
 $sudo easy_install -U rospkg

Unfortunately, I got a different failure msgs then:
 ... logging to /home/panda/.ros/log/e6c9fbac-efbf-11e1-8192-2e607c264e01/roslaunch-panda-1830.log

Unable to contact my own server at [http://panda:60413/].
This usually means that the network is not configured properly.

A common cause is that the machine cannot ping itself.  Please check
for errors by running:

        ping panda

For more tips, please see

        http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup

Which is really weird because i can ping myself without a problem. I deleted all rospkg folders again and used to get back to the old setup.
$sudo pip install -U rospkg
there was a interesting output while installing
Installing collected packages: rospkg
  Running setup.py install for rospkg
    changing mode of build/scripts-2.7/rosversion from 644 to 755

So a ROS-Version must be set somewhere.
the output from $roswtf ist
No package or stack in context
================================================================================
Static checks summary:

Found 1 error(s).

ERROR Not all paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH [/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks] point to an existing directory:
 * /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks

================================================================================

ROS Master does not appear to be running.
Online graph checks will not be run.
ROS_MASTER_URI is [http://localhost:11311]

I appreciate any kind of suggestions.

Edit:
Lorenz answer is the solution to the problem. I used $ sudo easy_install rospkg and then added
export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost  
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

to my .bashrc
There is now a failure msgs about
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'> ignored
but this shouldn't be an issue. (reference)

A:

I guess you have two problems:

rosversion could not be found which you apparently fixed by using easy_install and
a network problem that might be solved by setting ROS_IP. A quick search shows this. This and this are probably the answers you are looking for.

Do you know why my system needs to set to localhost? shouldn't it be panda... at least my command line says panda@panda
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-08-27:
Did you try to explicitly set ROS_HOSTNAME to panda?
Comment by dinamex on 2012-08-27:
when i try panda it says "Unable to contact my own server at [http://panda:60413/]" its just working with localhost. panda seems to be the default ROS_HOSTNAME as well.
Comment by Lorenz on 2012-08-27:
And you can ping panda? Did you set it in /etc/hosts? Did you have a look at this page and went through all steps?
Comment by dinamex on 2012-08-27:
I was able to ping panda but I needed to add "127.0.1.1 panda" to my /etc/hosts to get roscore to work
