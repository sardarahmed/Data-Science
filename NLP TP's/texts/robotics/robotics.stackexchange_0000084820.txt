Q:

With ar_pose_marker can the distance between the camera and the ar code be determined?

The coordinates that I get mediange ar_pose_marker do not reflect the distance between the camera and the observed AR code. As much as I move the AR code closer to the camera, the distance between the camera and the AR code can not be seen in the coordinates x, y, z.
In output_frame I put the frame_id of the camera

Solved, it was just a matter of adjusting the "marker_size" parameter
