Q:

two degree of freedom

Hi, I'm Angelo.
How I can do a joint with two degree of freedom?
If I do two time the joint, a first time for first degree of freedom, and a second time for second degree of freedom, with axis xyz="1 0 0" and xyz="0 1 0" respectively,and if i try to set any value on rpy in the first and second joint I see with rviz only the effect of the last join.
thank you very mich
Angelo

What? This question doesn't make any sense.

A:

Hello! I am assuming you mean in URDF. If so continue reading! I had the exact same problem with a hip joint the other day.
In order to get two degrees of freedom, make TWO revolute joints in the same location connected via a dummy link.
Example in Pseudo XML:
link thigh_link
link leg_link

link placeholder
 origin="0 0 0" //NOTE: this link has no change in location nor any geometry

joint hip_joint_x type="revolute"
 parent = "thigh_link"
 child = "placeholder"
 axis xyz="1 0 0"
/joint

joint hip_joint_y type="revolute"
 parent = "placeholder"
 child = "leg_link"
 axis xyz="0 1 0"
/joint

Hope this helps!
