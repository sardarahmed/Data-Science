Q:

max_step_size, real_time_factor and real_time_update_rate

I'm confused why you can specify all three of them in the world file. As far as I understand they are linearly dependent.
real_time_factor = max_step_size * real_time_update_rate
so if i set real_time_update_rate = 0 (to make gazebo run as fast as possible, what should i set real_time_factor to?

anyone? please

A:

I actually crawled the code to check this - real_time_factor is actually not used at all in the code (just set from the .world file and physics message, but never read - at least in the included physics engines, like ODE) and real_time_update_rate determines how long gazebo will sleep between simulation steps if > 0.
