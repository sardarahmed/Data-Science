Q:

rosmake and roscreate-pkg not responding

Hi,
I'm pretty new to ROS so please excuse me if I forget to mention stuff.
I was working on a project today. I think it doesn't matter what it was about. At some point when I was working on a .cpp file I tried to rosmake it, as I have done before dozens of times. At this time, however, nothing happend. I waited for a couple of minutes without anything changing.
After that couple of minutes I used ctrl+c to terminate rosmake.
This is what was printed in the terminal:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/opt/ros/fuerte/bin/roscreate-pkg", line 35, in <module>
  roscreate.roscreatepkg.roscreatepkg_main()

  for x in walk(new_path, topdown, onerror, followlinks):
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py", line 276, in walk
  names = listdir(top)
KeyboardInterrupt

It somehow seems that it freezes for some reason.
I have no idea what any of this means. And I unsuccessfully googled this error. When I try to run roscreate-pkg or roswtf I get similar results. rosrun however seems to work.
Thanks for your help!
Cheers,
Lukas
edit: The output is from roscreate-pkg!

I just tried it again and now it works. I rebooted after this problem occurred, but it didn't help. Apparently I needed to sleep over it and also let the computer sleep... Thanks anyways.

A:

It seems from the stack trace that PYTHON just had to crawl a HUGE lot of files in your folder, which takes time.
