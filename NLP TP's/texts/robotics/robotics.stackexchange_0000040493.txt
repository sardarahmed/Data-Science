Q:

Arduino tutorial: compile error in Arduino IDE

I'm working on the rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello World tutorial and when I compile the example code I get this error message:
In file included from /home/ryan/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros.h:38:0,
from HelloWorld.cpp:6:
/home/ryan/sketchbook/libraries/ros_lib/ros/node_handle.h:39:38: fatal error: rosserial_msgs/TopicInfo.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
I've tried copying and pasting files and folders with no luck.
I'm thinking maybe Arduino can't find my ros_workspace folder?
UPDATE: I repeated the tutorial and discovered that rosmake fails after the command: rosmake rosserial_arduino. The rosmake summary reads like this:
[ rosmake ] Output from build of package rosserial_arduino written to:
[ rosmake ] /home/ryan/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120514-181947/rosserial_arduino/build_output.log
[rosmake-0] Finished <<< rosserial_arduino [FAIL] [ 6.52 seconds ]
[ rosmake ] Halting due to failure in package rosserial_arduino.
[ rosmake ] Waiting for other threads to complete. [ rosmake ] Results:
[ rosmake ] Built 17 packages with 1 failures.
[ rosmake ] Summary output to directory
[ rosmake ] /home/ryan/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120514-181947
What would cause rosmake to fail?

More information is needed to figure that out. Could you paste the output of "roscd rosserial_arduino && make"?

A:

Working with ROS on Arduino requires copying files into your Arduino sketchbook. Be sure you have copied ros_lib from the ROS environment to your sketchbook. The beginning of the arduino tutorials provide instructions/commands for doing so.

I have the same issue in groovy. I have copied this files roslib in my sketchbook/libraries folder but that doesn't solve the problem. There is no node_handle.h in the folder.
