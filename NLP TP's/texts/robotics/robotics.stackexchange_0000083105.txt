Q:

How to set launch file arguments using roslaunch Python API

I am using the roslaunch Python API to run some launch files. Some of these launch files have some arguments (specified with the arg tag). On the terminal, I would set these arguments like this:
roslaunch mypkg foobar.launch bla:=42

Unfortunately I am not able to figure out how to set the argument (bla:=42) when running the same launch file with the Python API.

Hello,
After digging for a while, I believe it's not possible to set the arguments using the API.
There are related questions in this forum and seems that the users are using python subprocess to do that:
https://answers.ros.org/question/198910/how-to-set-args-with-python-roslaunch/
https://answers.ros.org/question/265796/parameters-roslaunch-from-python-script/
There's a page in ROS wiki as example, but without arguments:
http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/API%20Usage
If you want to check by yourself, here goes the API page that refers to the launch object used in a ROS wiki:
http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/roslaunch/html/roslaunch.parent.ROSLaunchParent-class.html
Fortunately, there's a Pull Request that proposes a solution to that issue:

I hope it can help you!
