Q:

rqt saving configuration

Hi there!
I just discovered rqt which seems to be super cool thing :) Is there a way to save configuration? So next time I just load all the plugins I've chosen previosly? (Like loading config in RViz)
Cheers,
da-na

A:

To compensate for @felix k's answer, rqt saves so-called perspective when it's run on rqt_gui and closed. (I just found that it's not documented) things that are saved include:

plugins opened
plugins' size and positions within the container window (rqt_gui)
rqt_gui's size and position with respect to the computer's desktop

To run rqt_gui, you just run:
$ rqt  (Groovy and later)
$ rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui  (Fuerte)

Running rqt_gui is the recommended usage of rqt, although you can run each rqt plugin individually.
In response to the RViz example in your question, rqt_gui does NOT save the configuration of each plugins as I listed above; instead it's up to how each plugin is implemented. And the feature of rqt variant of Rviz, rqt_rviz, is the same with what RViz has, because rqt_rviz embeds RViz, which doesn't save the .config file that was used the last time (if I remember correctly). You can open an enhancement request here.

Actually every plugin can save its intrinsic state and restore it again. Some plugins store things like checked checkboxes and values of input fields. rqt_publisher e.g. restores the list of message types to be published to reuse the once setup publishers.

Hi Dirk. Would you be able to briefly describe the procedure for saving the intrinsic state (specifically the config) of an Rviz plugin? Thank you very much for your time.

Every plugin can persist information through these two callbacks: https://github.com/ros-visualization/qt_gui_core/blob/1eaff5a7586e78ec4f5bf501d9a3172a5da07b06/qt_gui/src/qt_gui/plugin.py#L50-L68

The rqt_rviz plugin would need to implement those order to store / restore information.

Thank you!

Hi Dirk, can you please let me know the file/file location in which to place the two callbacks for the rqt_rviz plugin? I'm not finding an rviz.cpp file. Thanks again.

Where does it save the default perspective? I can't seem to find it. But it does save it for sure because restarting rqt returns to the state it was exited in.
