Q:

No observations available

Hi, I am trying to make a mesh
rosrun object_recognition_reconstruction mesh_object --all --visualize --commit

but a got this:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/tomas/ws/src/ork_reconstruction/apps/mesh_object", line 191, in <module>
simple_mesh_session(dbs, session, args)
File "/home/tomas/ws/src/ork_reconstruction/apps/mesh_object", line 87, in simple_mesh_session
raise RuntimeError("There are no observations available.")
RuntimeError: There are no observations available.

What does it mean? Is something wrong with my database? I normally uploaded .bag file before so I dont understand why no observations are available.
[edit]
So I realized the problem is probably while uploading.
rosrun object_recognition_capture upload -i final.bag -n 'box' box juice --commit

Gives these errors:

A:

This was an image encoding problem. It should have been fixed: https://github.com/wg-perception/capture/pull/23
