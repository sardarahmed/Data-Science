Is it possible to debug costmap2d plugin?

I am using vscode with ROS extension installed and I would like to debug my custom costmap plugins but not sure how to start to debugger for it. ROS navigation packages are installed as binary and currently I am using ROS Noetic.

A:

Yes, a costmap plugin can be debugged but it takes some effort.
The costmap plugins are loaded into the move_base process and execute there. You need to build the navigation stack from source in your local catkin_ws, and tell catkin_make to create a Debug build:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

You can then "attach" the debugger to an already-running move_base process, or temporarily remove move_base from your launch file and start it using the debugger.
