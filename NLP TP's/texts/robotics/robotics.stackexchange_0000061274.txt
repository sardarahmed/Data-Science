Q:

When i  launch move_base.launch, I got this :
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [tf/static_transform_publisher]: can't locate node [static_transform_publisher] in package [tf]
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [amcl/amcl]: can't locate node [amcl] in package [amcl]

However I already have done : sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-amcl and sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-tf

What happens if you do roscd tf?
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-29:
/opt/ros/hydro/share/tf$
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-29:
and for amcl : /opt/ros/hydro/share/amcl

Can you post your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable?
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-29:
What is my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH ? the path for the catkin_ws  folder?
If yes it is /home/lempereur/catkin_ws
and the path for the hydro is /opt/ros/hydro/
Comment by sterlingm on 2014-07-29:
Do "env | grep ROS" and you will see it. It is the path where ROS looks for your packages. But if roscd takes you where you listed it is probably fine. Do "ls /opt/ros/hydro/lib/tf" and see if it lists the static_transform_publisher executable.
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-29:
My ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks
Comment by Moda on 2014-07-29:
when I maid ls /opt/ros/hydro/lib/tf I get bullet_migration_sed.py  static_transform_publisher  tf_change_notifier  tf_echo  tf_empty_listener  tf_monitor  tf_remap  view_frames
Comment by BennyRe on 2014-07-29:
Ok static_transform_publisher exists. Do ls -l /opt/ros/hydro/lib/tf to see if it's executable.
Comment by Moda on 2014-08-01:
I got this : -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  18872 juin  17 10:57 static_transform_publisher
Comment by Moda on 2014-08-01:
And even for amcl I have this : -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 620296 juil. 23 21:42 amcl

hello, I have the same problem with you. Did you solve this problem? Could you tell me how?

A:

I deleted all the files from my workspace, and reinstall everythink. And it solves my error.
Thank you for your help BennyRe and Sterlingm.
However, i got this error :
Waiting on transform from base_link to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: 
[ WARN] [1406882852.669591743]: No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published) for 1406882852.669489 seconds.  Verify that data is being published on the /scan topic.

I already faced this issue in groovy, and i was unable to found a solution.
