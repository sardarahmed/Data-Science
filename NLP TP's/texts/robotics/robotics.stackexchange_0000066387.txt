Q:

Problem with pr2_2dnav tutorial

Hello,
i'm trying to follow the pr2_2dnav tutorial but I found that when  I execute the command roslaunch pr2_2dnav pr2_2dnav.launch it says:
[pr2_2dnav.launch] is neither a launch file in package [pr2_2dnav] nor is [pr2_2dnav] a launch file name

I used sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pr2-2dnav in order to obtain the package.
What could generate this problem?
Thanks beforehand!

A:

Looking at the CMakeLists.txt for pr2_2dnav for Hydro, it would appear that the launch file is not installed (the build script is missing an install(..) rule). That would result in the error message you quoted.
You can check this by doing a ls -al /opt/ros/hydro/share/pr2_2dnav/ and then look for the pr2_2dnav.launch file in the listing. It will most likely not be there.
If the file is missing, please log an issue on the pr2_navigation_apps issue tracker.

under this directory is only a cmake folder and a package.xml file, there are no more files/folders. Should I log an issue then?

By the way, it is possible to use this library for the turtlebot? or it is only for PR2 robot?
