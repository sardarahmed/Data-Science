Q:

indigo source installation problems:

i first had installed ros indigo using apt,then after uninstalling i installed ros from source,now i am facing so many problems..

Please specify exactly what you are doing, what you want to achieve and what happens instead, including the exact commands and outputs verbatim. The second bullet seems like a different issue that should be in a separate question.

catkin_make for packages installed via rosdep install is not necessary and usually also not possible.

A:

I have an another way around for installing dependencies using rosinstall_generator

[rosinstall_generator <pkg_name> --deps --exclude RPP  >  <pkg_name>.rosinstall]{this will create a rosinstall file with all uninstlled dependencies listed}
[rosinstall src/ <pkg_name>.rosinstall]{this will install the packages mentioned in the rosinstall file}

nb: Do this in the catkin root directory
