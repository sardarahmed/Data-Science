Is Java a strict requirement, or are you just looking for an easy way to put together a GUI for controlling ROS apps? Have you looked into rqt?

Java is not a mandatory requirement. But why not Java? I will take a look at rqt but also i wanted to know why rqt but not java? Thanks

Thank you Tom. How can I use these plugins? I'm beginner in using ROS.

The rqt wiki page has a list of available plugins and a tutorial on how to write your own.

A:

rqt was designed to allow you to rapidly throw together a GUI for your ROS-based robot. It already has a bunch of plugins written for it, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. I don't know if there's a plugin for connecting to databases, but you could always write one.
