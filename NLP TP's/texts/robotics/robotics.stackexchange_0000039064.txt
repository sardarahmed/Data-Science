Q:

ASUS Xtion and Open NI documentation

I have come across lot of documentation and books on Microsoft Kinect;
Beginning Kinect Programming with the Microsoft Kinect SDK
Meet the Kinect: An Introduction to Programming Natural User Interfaces
Hacking the Kinect
However, I have not found much on the ASUS Xtion or on Open NI. Being a Xtion rookie, where should I start ? Any reference to forums, websites, books, tutorials etc would be most useful.
Any first hand experience on how to marry the Xtion (as of now without any robot) with ROS ? Do I have to use OpenNI, or ROS has any way around ?

A:

The power of OpenNI is that it is a "standard" interface to many devices (currently the older Primesense SDK5 devices, Asus XTION and the Kinect). It works just fine with the ROS OpenNI drivers.
