A:

According to wiki/openni_tracker and status_page/ros_jade_default.html?q=openni, that packages has not been released into Jade, so you cannot install it using apt-get.
The latest released version is for Hydro. You may be able to build the package from sources. The wiki page has the link to the github repository containing them.
