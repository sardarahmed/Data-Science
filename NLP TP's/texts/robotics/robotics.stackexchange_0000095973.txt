Q:

gmapping params width/height/resolution

Distro Kinetic
SO Ubuntu 16.04
Hello, i am trying to create a tool for mapping for Windows/Android but i first need to unsderstand how mapping works. i have a launch file to start gmapping, i am setting the xmin xmax ymin ymax values to: -10, 10, -10, 10 so at the start, the map size if im correct it should be 20 m width and 20 m height. When using rviz to check if the map size is correct, i am chcecking the corners of the map and they are showing the expected value. i am also setting the delta resolution to 0.1 so basically 10 cells it is 1 meter, so the map should be 200 cells width x 200 width cells height, but when using rostopic echo /map i see that the map being display has a width of 192 and a height of 192, i am completly lost and i have no idea why the size of the map being displayed is 192

A:

the answer was way simplier than i firstly thought. The maps get created using grids thats why there cant be maps of 200 cells for example
