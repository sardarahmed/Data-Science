Q:

Angle to a circle tangent line

I want to simulate the detection of a moving object by a unicycle type robot. The robot is modelled with position (x,y) and direction theta as the three states. The obstacle is represented as a circle of radius r1 (r_1 in my code). I want to find the angles alpha_1 and alpha_2from the robot's local coordinate frame to the circle, as shown here:

So what I am doing is trying to find the angle from the robot to the line joining the robot and the circle's centre (this angle is called aux_t in my code), then find the angle between the tangent and the same line (called phi_c). Finally I would find the angles I want by adding and subtracting phi_c from aux_t. The diagram I am thinking of is shown:

The problem is that I am getting trouble with my code when I try to find the alpha angles: It starts calculating the angles correctly (though in negative values, not sure if this is causing my trouble) but as both the car and the circle get closer, phi_c becomes larger than aux_t and one of the alphas suddenly change its sign. For example I am getting this:
$$\begin{array}{c c c c} 
\text{aux_t} & \text{phi_c} & \text{alpha_1} & \text{alpha_2} \\ \hline
\text{-0.81} & \text{+0.52} & \text{-1.33} & \text{-0.29} \\
\text{-0.74} & \text{+0.61} & \text{-1.35} & \text{-0.12} \\
\text{-0.69} & \text{+0.67} & \text{-1.37} & \text{-0.02} \\
\text{-0.64} & \text{+0.74} & \text{-1.38} & \text{+0.1} \\
\end{array}$$
So basically, the alpha_2 gets wrong form here. I know I am doing something wrong but I'm not sure what, I don't know how to limit the angles from 0 to pi. Is there a better way to find the alpha angles?

A:

First, determine the angle $\phi$ between the robot $<\!a_{x},a_{y},\theta\!>$ and the target $<\!p_{x},p_{y}\!>$ as follows 
$$
\phi = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{ p_{y} - a_{y} }{ p_{x} - a_{x} } \right) - \theta
$$
See the below picture,

Based on $\phi$, you can determine the rest.
