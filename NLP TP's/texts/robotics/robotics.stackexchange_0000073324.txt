Q:

rosrun cannot find executables

I realize this question has been asked to death, but when running rosrun raspicam raspicam_node I get the message [rosrun] Couldn't find executable named raspicam_node below /opt/ros/indigo/share/raspicam.
I am running Raspbian jessie on a Raspberry Pi 2 with ROS Indigo. catkin_make_isolated was used to build the workspace.
I placed the following lines in .bashrc:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks export ROS_WORKSPACE=/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws
Prior to running rosrun, I enter the ros_catkin_ws directory and input source devel_isolated/setup.bash
The executable exists under ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/raspicam/lib/raspicam.
If I move the executable to ros_catkin_ws/src/raspicam/src, everything works fine, but I would rather it work without manually moving files.
Output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Before sourcing: /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks
after sourcing: /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/image_transport_plugins/theora_image_transport:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

You can try source devel_isolated/setup.bash --extend instead. Without the extend flag, the last sourced file overwrites all of the previously loaded ones.

If that does not help, please, edit your question and append the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH after you source your workspace. And another thing - is the executable a Python script? If so, they have custom handling that allows you to run files directly from the source space.

I added the output of echo echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH before and after sourcing. This is clearly a problem.
The script is c++ not Python.

I think the .bashrc lines are not correct. Try source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash; source /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash --extend; and do NOT manually set ROS_PACKAGE_PATH nor ROS_WORKSPACE. And also make sure you've built your workspace with catkin_make and try in a new terminal.

A:

The problem seems to have been fixed by putting the raspicam package in a separate workspace.

Haha , mahnnnn. Thanks for this .
Changing the workspace somehow fixed the problem .
Was breaking my head over it for over 2-3hours!
