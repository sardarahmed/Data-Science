Q:

error: package org.opencv.android does not exist

Hi guys,
I’m working on a project to view 3D objects using PTAM library. When executing the project, I get the error: “error: package org.opencv.android does not exist." What would be the solution for this? OpenCV  downloaded the android SDK and have included the project. But I got the same error. What would be the solution for this?
Thanks.
