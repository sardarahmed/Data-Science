Q:

ROSTutorialsWritingPublisherSubscriber(c++) CMakeLists.txt include_directories

I have done the tutorial successfully, catkin_make and execution work.
The tutorial says:
include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

But I did, and it still works:
include_directories( ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

So , the word include is optional? why?
Thanks in advance

A:

Adding include is only necessary if your package contains an include/ subdirectory with headers needed for compiling some of your C++ programs.
If there are no such references, the include is unnecessary, but harmless.
For more details, see: http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/building_executables.html
