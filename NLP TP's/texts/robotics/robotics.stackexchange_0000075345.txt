Q:

Using ROS to detect obstacles

Hi,
I am new to using ROS, I am currently doing my final year project for detecting obstacles in an outdoor environment (e.g on airport runway surfaces). Are there any tips on how I can construct a package that can perform 3d mapping of obstacles using stereo vision? Thank you.

Looking for the same thing basically

A:

There are several existing ROS packages that process stereo camera data. You might browse packages for your ROS installation: http://www.ros.org/browse/list.php. In particular, the stereo_image_proc package claims to be able to publish point clouds from stereo image processing (http://wiki.ros.org/stereo_image_proc). (I don't have any experience with that package, so can't give any more info.)

The problem appears with ROS KINETIC as in INDIGO it works fine, but this is not the case of KINETIC which provide no disparity map

I installed ROS INDIGO and I seem to face the same problem as using ROS KINETIC, following the 'Choosing good stereo parameters' tutorial, I got till this part:
$ rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure
reconfigure_gui started
and the gui shows a blank drop down menu. I have no idea how to proceed.

Unfortunately, as I said, I don't have experience with those packages. If you like, I'll delete this answer entirely to avoid people bypassing the question because they think it's already answered.

Thanks for the offer, I think it's alright to leave the answer up, it is a good starting point for people who want to do the same thing as I did. Maybe they would have more knowledge on how to work around the errors.

Stupid question, probably, but have you started roscore and the stereo processing node first? (I haven't yet used dynamic reconfiguration, but it looks like rqt_configure just looks at the current node graph to determine what to show in its GUI.)

Also, you don't have to run rqt_configure, probably. Instead, set parameters in your launch file, then kill, edit, and restart to try different parameters. More of a pain, of course.
