Q:

Husky robot shows rostopics but not message over them

I have a Clearpath husky robot setup with their ros noetic image (ubuntu 20.04 on amd64 architecture) clearpath-universal-noetic-amd64-0.5.14.iso which to my surprise did not come with ros and other packages pre-installed. So, I installed them (husky_base, husky_bringup, husky_control, husky_description, husky_gazebo, husky_msgs, husky_viz) manually. I followed the instructions on http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/noetic/husky/InstallHuskySoftware.html#installing-husky-software till the command sudo journalctl -u ros. rostopic list gives me the below output.
administrator@husky:~$ rostopic list
/cmd_vel
/diagnostics
/diagnostics_agg
/diagnostics_toplevel_state
/e_stop
/husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel
/husky_velocity_controller/odom
/imu/data
/joint_states
/joy_teleop/cmd_vel
/joy_teleop/joy
/joy_teleop/joy/set_feedback
/odometry/filtered
/rosout
/rosout_agg
/set_pose
/tf
/tf_static
/twist_marker_server/cmd_vel
/twist_marker_server/feedback
/twist_marker_server/update
/twist_marker_server/update_full

But I don't see any message over them as there is no publisher.
administrator@husky:~$ rostopic info /husky_velocity_controller/odom 
Type: nav_msgs/Odometry

Publishers: None

Subscribers: 
 * /ekf_localization (http://husky:42525/)

For the same robot, I have ROS melodic on ubuntu 18.04 (trimmed down version supplied by clearpath) which can echo the same topics easily. The publisher for same topic in the working setup is husky_node. I think this is the issue over here but don't know how to fix it. My COMM light for noetic setup is RED and for melodic is GREEN.
administrator@husky:~$ rosnode list
/diagnostic_aggregator
/ekf_localization
/husky_node
/joy_teleop/joy_node
/joy_teleop/teleop_twist_joy
/robot_state_publisher
/rosout
/twist_marker_server
/twist_mux

This is the output of rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor for noetic setup.

A:

Did you select the Husky option while installing the ISO?  Could you provide the output of sudo journalctl -u ros? (It wasn't include in the question).
