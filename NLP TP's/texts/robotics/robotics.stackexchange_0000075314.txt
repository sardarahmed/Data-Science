Q:

Generate odometry from encoders, cmd_vel, differential velocity

Hi to all,
I'm trying to mix /imu/data with my robot (Clearpath Husky) odometry by using the robot_localization package in order to use them with the rtabmap_ros package with my RealSense and SICK data.
I'm doing this because I want to improve my 3D map by adding IMU information in RTAB-Map.
I already have the /imu/data information, but I don't have the /odometry topic.
During my field tests, I only recorded encoders, differential_velocity and cmd_vel.
Is it possbible to use these topics to generate the /odometry message needed by the robot_localization package?
I hope you can help me!
Thank you!

A:

The EKF in r_l supports multiple input message types. See this section of the wiki. You aren't required to have any set of input topics; you can have as many or as few as you want (though more is usually better).
