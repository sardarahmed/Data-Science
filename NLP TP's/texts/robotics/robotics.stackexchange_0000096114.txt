A:

Hello,
The autoware_msgs` package is missing. Did you source the ROS workspace where this package is installed? Otherwise you will probably need to compile it

On every terminal that you use, you need to change to the autoware installation folder (probably ~/autoware.ai and then run source install/setup.bash
