Q:

bash: /opt/ros/lunar/setup.bash: No such file or directory

Dear Users;
I installed Ros Lunar distro before. After that I decided to switch to Kinetic. Therefore, I remove Lunar from the terminal, and then installed ROS Kinetic. However; I still have this problem: "bash: /opt/ros/lunar/setup.bash: No such file or directory"
I can not find where is this file. In the opt directory, there is no lunar, because I already deleted it. And I can't find that comment file  to fix that source file that is reading that comment.
Any advice?
Thanks in advance.

Later I found this, and it fixed the problem:
Dear @gvdhoorn, thank you for your response.
