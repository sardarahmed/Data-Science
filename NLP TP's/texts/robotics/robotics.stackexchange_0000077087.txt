A:

You can use robot_localization to fuse the indoor GPS data with the odometry, and a package like move_base or moveit! to do the path planning and motion planning.
May I ask how you are obtaining GPS indoors? Or is that part of your question?

I am using infrared beacons to get the coordinates of the robot. It has got a ROS package and able to show the x,y,z coordinates
