Q:

roscore killing on exit error

I installed fuerte a few days ago and removed electric because I messed with something and wasn't running properly anymore.
Upon typing roscore, ROS seems to startup but then, I get an error message saying something along the lines of:
Error: could not contact master [http://ubuntu:11311]
[master] killing on exit
I'd really appreciate some help with this. Thank you in advance.

A:

Your environment variables are probably not set up correctly. Try:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

You should also check that ROS_ROOT and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH are set up correctly for fuerte.
