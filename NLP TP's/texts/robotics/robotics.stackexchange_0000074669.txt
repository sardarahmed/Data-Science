Q:

turtlemimic.launch problem

hello!
i am currently working with the tutorials and i got stuck. Let me explain the problem:
in the tutorial about roslaunch it says "now let's create a launch file called turtlemimic.launch and paste the following:..... "
i created the file using "touch turtlemimic.launch.xml" and i wrote the code using nano.
when i type  "roslaunch beginner_tutorials turtlemimic.launch" i get:
[turtlemimic.launch] is neither a launch file in package [beginner_tutorials] nor is [beginner_tutorials] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file
I dont get what the problem is. Any help would be appreciated
Thank you!

A:

Launch files have a .launch extension. Only give launch files a .xml extension if you don't want them to be included in the auto-complete list (ie: when you press tab tab).
