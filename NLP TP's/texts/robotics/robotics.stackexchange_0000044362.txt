Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: pid controller

Hi All,
Im trying to implement my own pid controller os a simple joint.
my difficulty is to understand how to build it using srv/topics/actionlib etc,
and how to get a continuous action that will evantually stop the joint at the right position.
thanks,
Nir.

A:

pr2_controller_manager provides a hard realtime loop to control the robot mechanism. The robot mechanism is represented by a set of effort controlled joints. I really tried this and it is a really great tool. Dont think that it is only for pr2. Here some useful links to check out

implementing pid with control toolbox and pr2 controller
hope these help
