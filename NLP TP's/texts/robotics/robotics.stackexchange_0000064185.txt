Q:

how to use laser scan matcher?

I am very new to ROS I have to use the laser_Scan_matcher which I got from github scan_tools. when I do catkin_make
There is a error csm/csm_all.h... I added it by downloading this .h file, again on catkin_make I get another file missing like this I got more than 50 files approximately...and still its files not found errors are increasing as I add each missing file ...Please help me to solve this problem,  what is the exact package files I needed and modifications to be done .
Please help in clear steps how to use a bag file say example 2robots.hospitals bagfile and what will be the output for laser_scan_matcher.

I can see only the laser_scan_matcher_node in lib/laser_Scan_matcher after catkin_make. How to test this laser scan matcher?
Comment by chaiein on 2014-11-26:
$ rosrun laser_scan_matcher laser_scan_matcher_node is executed on bag file running behind in another terminal.. I got [ INFO] []: Starting LaserScanMatcher
what should be the next step?
