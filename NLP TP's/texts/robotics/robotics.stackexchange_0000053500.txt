Q:

Problem with connecting to Husky via USB port

I am trying to run Husky and using the instruction for husky in fuerte
However, when I use this command "roslaunch husky_bringup base.launch port:=/dev/ttyUSB0" it gives me the following error:
connecting error on /dev/ttyUSB0. Will retry every second
Does anyone have any idea what is the source of problem and how can I solve it?
Thanks,

A:

We're working on this directly with @z.bagheri63 via our support line at the moment, but to make sure the answer is out here: We believe that the root cause is that there is more than one ROS instance trying to access the serial port.
