Q:

Straight dump of the error message:

A:

Hello berlin,
usually, when you get this kind of error it means that you don't have some packages installed. In your case, it would be interactive_markers.
You can easily install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-interactive-markers

Also, I would suggest reading about find_package. It could save you a lot of time in the future if you understand how this command works (since it is used all the time).
If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
