Q:

Navigation stack - only in place turning

Hi there,
I have a Robot that runs pretty good under ROS. I can teleop it, have a valid URDF-model, I can create maps with the help of the laser scanner.
The robot itself is differential driven. It has a rectangular shape with 4 wheels. The motorized wheels are located in the front, where the base_link is located, too.
When I follow the tutorials to get the whole navigation stack running. The Path to a navigation goal is calculated and displayed as well. But the robot does not follow the path. It is performing in place rotations instead of forward driving. The cmd_vel-topic says so, too. The angular.z component is at the maximum set in my parameters and the linear x and y component are zero (y should be 0 as it is non holonomic).
Is this a known problem? Is it caused by the uncircular shape of the robot?
Could anybody help me?
Thanks so far.
Sven

A:

hmm it seems like this is a problem of the local planner... This usually happens when the robot thinks it is too close to an obstacle.
Are you sure the local and global costmap show no obstacles close to the robot?
You can also try to use another local-planner. ROS offers the "base_local_planner" and "dwa_local_planner" (see http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/Navigation #4 for more information).
But my guess still is that there is something set up wrong with the localization and/or obstacles...

Couple of Qs: Isn't dwa one of the parameters that can be set in base_local_planner? Then why does it have a different package with different names for the same parameters?
And why does Navigation Stack spin like that when it is close to obstacles?
