Q:

fovis_ros and xtion (no rgb)

I want to use fovis_ros with my xtion to build lately a 3d map using octomap , but when i start the launch file of openni2 and mono_deth_odometer of fovis package i have the following errors:
1)The camera say me that the image taken is uncalibrated.
2)Fovis_ros receive image and info from the respective topic , but the "synchronized tuples" are 0.
3)I cannot visualize in anyway the result from fovis_ros topic (features,pose,odoemtry).

If the answer pleases you, would you please mark the question as answered?

A:

Hi Saracemo,
fovis needs grayscale rectified images. If color images are provided, they are converted to grayscale. Please use the launchfile provided in fovis_ros github source page and your openni launchfile.
