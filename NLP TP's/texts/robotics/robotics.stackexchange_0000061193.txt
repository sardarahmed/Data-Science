Q:

Programmatically Polling the Build Farm

What is the best way to programmatically get the status of packages on the build farm? Is there an API? The status page does some sneaky javascripting, so scraping the HTML does not work.

A:

The HTML of the debbuild status page is regenerated every 15 minutes. The Javascript is only doing some client-side filtering - no polling of data.
You also don't have to parse the HTML itself. The HTML is generated from the data in the CSV files which are available in the same location: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/
So you can e.g. poll http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.csv to create your own status page / monitoring system.

This is useful. Two things:

The html itself does not seem to contain the different build information. If you read the source HTML, that data is filled in dynamically somewhere.

The CSVs do not contain maintainer information, which I imagine can just be crossreferenced with the rosdistro info

Yes, the CSV data is cross referenced with information available via rosdistro. If you want to see what is actually done the script generating these files is https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm/blob/master/scripts/generate_status_page.py
