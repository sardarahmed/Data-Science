Q:

C++ RAII interface to ROS?

Is there a supported RAII interface to ROS?  i.e. a class that encapsulates the ros connection, with initialization in the constructor and teardown in the destructor, etc?
The tutorials all seem to start with a call to ros::init, for example, and I don't understand why that can't just be done in the NodeHandle constructor.

A:

So far, there is nothing (afaik). If often happens (at least for me) that you have several NodeHandels in a single Node. I have one for the global namespace and one local ( NodeHandle("~") ) so that it's a bit easier to see where a parameter comes from.
But the concept of a node lifecycle will probably end up in ROS 2:
