Q:

error: ‘class btMatrix3x3’ has no member named ‘getRPY’ when building tf

Hello -- I'm trying to build tf from source on a beagle. I built the fuerte-ros-base.rosinstall and that all installed properly. I downloaded tf using:
roslocate info tf | rosws merge -
rosws update

I also installed bullet using
roslocate info bullet | rosws merge -
rosws update

after sorting out all my other dependencies I ran
rosmake geometry

and now I am getting errors:
  /home/ubuntu/ros/geometry/tf/include/tf/transform_datatypes.h: In function ‘double tf::getYaw(const Quaternion&)’:
  /home/ubuntu/ros/geometry/tf/include/tf/transform_datatypes.h:140:21: error: ‘class btMatrix3x3’ has no member named ‘getRPY’

I saw this old message on ros-users which seemed relevant:
http://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20091009.014115.55a2c1bd.ca.html
but that was ages ago, and it claims that this problem was fixed. (I tried deleting bullet/build as recommended in that email just in case, but that didn't resolve anything)
I'm guessing it has something to do with a version mismatch between the geometry stack and the bullet stack that I have picked up. roslocate gave me the tf_rework branch of geometry and the default branch of bullet.
Which branches should I use for use with fuerte?
Thanks
UPDATE: I tried using the tf_rework branch of bullet and I received this error when building:
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:

A:

So I set the branch in geometry to fuerte_devel and the branch in bullet to default and now it compiles nicely.

@sameer - I am trying to add a bit of my code to the source code of a pre-built package so that I can get R,P,Y values for a particular bot. The issue is I tried "making" the file after I put in the same code using getRPY but it shows me the same error. Could you please help me with this?
