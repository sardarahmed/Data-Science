Q:

Mesh path from gzserver to gzclient

Hi,
I got the same issue for two interns, they can't load gzclient without an error about the 3D files not found with the path on the gzserver on a remote server. Both of them use roslaunch files to start . They use a custom version of husky robot and hector_quadcopter. The URI of each stl file is correct and I enforce the env variables gazebo_model_path and gazebo_media_path.
Very strange.

A:

The client receives only the model descriptions, and not the mesh files. Also, URIs are paths on the remote server. So, if a model says that a mesh is installed in path A on the remote server, it needs to also be installed in path A on the local machine. Otherwise, the client fails to load the models.
