A:

Find wherever your robot description is launched. Maybe you could grep for it:
grep -r "robot_description" *

Then change the command slightly:
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro '$(find robot_description)/urdf/my_robot.urdf.xacro'" />

to
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro '--inorder' '$(find robot_description)/urdf/my_robot.urdf.xacro'" />

Can you explain the difference between traditional processing and inorder?
