Q:

What does CATKIN_IGNORE file does in build folder in catkin_ws?

Hi,
While the ROS tutorials page on catkin_workspace, I  came across the CATKIN_IGNORE file present in the build folder contain in the catkin_ws. I want to know what does the CATKIN_IGNORE file do ?

A:

CATKIN_IGNORE is a bit underdocumented, but the tutorial you link actually seems to contain the answer to your question:

CATKIN_IGNORE         -- Keeps catkin from walking this directory

In other words: a CATKIN_IGNORE file in the build directory makes Catkin (ie: catkin_make, catkin_make_isolated, but also catkin from catkin_tools) ignore that specific directory.
This works for other directories as well.

Thanks gvdhoorn

REP-128 shows this file in a workspace build/ dir (and with multiple pkgs shown in workspace_folder/src I took it to imply a meta-package or even ~/catkin_ws itself). I only got it to work in the top level of the package. In that sense, I found the existing documentation confusing.

This answer resolved my confusion on what to do after trying a bunch of incantations of it in a catkin_ws/src/pkg/build location. Ultimately I just used ~/catkin_ws/src/pkg/CATKIN_IGNORE successfully.

As I wrote: CATKIN_IGNORE is rather underdocumented. But from your issue on catkin_pkg I'm guessing this is sort-of resolved now.

The question & answer you link to are the same as I linked to as being 'related'?
