Q:

Has anyone worked with the Clearpath Robotics Husky A200?

I am wondering if anyone has worked with the Clearpath Robotics Husky A200 platform under ROS.
Specifically I would like to know:

Does the ROS API give you enough flexibility?
What hardware do you use to interface with it? (i.e. laptop, netbook, microATX board)
What additional sensors have you used with it?
Thanks!

A:

I haven't personally used it, but it appears that the ROS API is well-written and well-supported by the actual manufacturer/designer.
It appears that all of the information from the robot base is brought out on various message types.  I don't know what kind of "flexibility" that you are looking for, but you could probably use the documented API and extend it to anything that you could possibly need.

ROS.org Clearpath Base Wiki
Clearpath Base Code API
Clearpath Base Messages

I would imagine that any computer supported by ROS and clearpath would serve to work with the platform.
