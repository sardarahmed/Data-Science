Q:

Cannot install baxter simulator in ROS Indigo

I am trying to install Baxter simulator so that I may use it with Moveit without connecting to a real Baxter robot. I have followed the following tutorial:
link:Baxter Wiki
When I try this command:
sudo apt-get install gazebo2 ros-indigo-qt-build ros-indigo-driver-common ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-control ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-indigo-ros-control ros-indigo-control-toolbox ros-indigo-realtime-tools ros-indigo-ros-controllers ros-indigo-xacro python-wstool ros-indigo-tf-conversions ros-indigo-kdl-parser

I get the following error:
 Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

I also tried this command:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-baxter-simulator

The same issue exists. Why the packages are not found?

Does a sudo apt update complete successfully?
Could it be that you're running into #q325039?

It did not fix the issue.

Then you'll need to show us the output of sudo apt update and of the sudo apt-get install .. command.
Please copy-paste errors and messages verbatim. Do not paraphrase errors.

Oh it did actually, after doing the sudo update

So this was #q325039?
