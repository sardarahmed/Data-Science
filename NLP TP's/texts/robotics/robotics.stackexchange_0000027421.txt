Q:

Mouse control buttons

Is there a way to change the view control with the mouse so that it is similar to Rviz?
Having the scroll and the left button functions switched between both softwares is very confusing.

A:

Currently Gazebo offers two ways to control the camera view: the one you're using, i.e. "Orbit View control" and the "FPS View control", which works by dragging the mouse's left-button to rotate and the WASD keys to translate the view. You can change between these at the Camera menu.
There's currently no way to customize the role of mouse buttons for the view controls. I created a feature request to add user preferences customization.
