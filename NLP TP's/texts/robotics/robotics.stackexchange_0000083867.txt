Q:

when I launch a sweep scan launchfile, failed

$ roslaunch sweep_ros sweep2scan.launch 

[ERROR] [1510555966.860890582]: Skipping XML Document "/opt/ros/kinetic/share/gmapping/nodelet_plugins.xml" which had no Root Element.  This likely means the XML is malformed or missing.

I dont know why.

A:

This is a known issue with the latest gmapping release and should be fixed in the next release.
See ros-perception/slam_gmapping#56 and #q274849.
