Q:

Open launch files with gedit using HTML default

Hello,
When I open a file with extension .launch using the gedit, the file open without Plain Text. After I choose the option HTML in Plain Text Menu, I closed the file and openned again, the file start with HTML format.
My question is: Is there a way to make default HTML for the entire .launch extension?

This is more a Linux/platform configuration issue than a ROS issue. Could you please post this sort of question on a more appropriate forum in the future?
I'm not sure it's the best way (or even the recommended way), but it would appear that configuring a default highlighter for specific file types is possible using a 'language definition file'.
See an I set a default syntax highlighting in Gedit? on Ask Ubuntu.

After I choose the option HTML in Plain Text Menu

Know that .launch files are XML, not HTML. If Gedit has a highlighter for that, I would use the XML highlighter.
