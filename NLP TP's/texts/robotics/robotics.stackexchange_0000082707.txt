In the future, please make sure your question adheres to our Support Guidelines. It's harder to help you if you don't.

Also: ROS Answers is a beginners forum, so we're happy to help, but such simple things as installing packages is really something that has been asked and answered many times before and is documented. Please make the effort to search first and save us all the time to answer it again.

A:

Just as any other package that has been released:
sudo apt-get install ros-$release-ros-numpy

Where $release is the name of the ROS release that you have installed.

This does not work for ROS Melodic
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-30:
Which is to be expected, seeing as the package has not been released into Melodic.
See ros_numpy and status_page/ros_melodic_default.html?q=numpy.
Note also I wrote:

as any other package that has been released

Understood. Your answer was written before Melodic was released, and is now outdated. This is not "to be expected" for anyone using any of the currently recommended ROS distributions in 2020.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-01-31:
The "to be expected" part was responding to the fact that you stated it doesn't work for Melodic. That is certainly to be expected, as it hasn't been released for that version of ROS.
I don't really see how that would not be expected. No matter which version of ROS you are using: if a package has not been released for it, you cannot use apt to install it (on Debian/Ubuntu).
