Q:

Gazebo 1.8.0 , typo?

Hi,
I just installed Gazebo from source, and I get the version number 1.8.0, but the change-log doesn't say anything about it. Is it a typo?
Cheers,
Andrei

A:

I'm assuming you installed from default? It's correct in the latest release branches (1.7 and 1.7.1) ... default often gets pushed to the next minor version to make it easier to separate it from already released versions I think.
