Q:

How to install ament_cmake_python?

From this tutorial I discovered that the following package is available:
ament_cmake_python

but doing:
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake_python test_interfaces

I get the following error:
ros2 pkg create: error: argument --build-type: invalid choice: 'ament_cmake_python' (choose from 'cmake', 'ament_cmake', 'ament_python')

How do I get the ament_cmake_python package working?
The link to github doesn't contain any installation instruction.
Thanks

A:

The answer is:
there is no possibility to create a package with that option ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake_python test_interfaces
You can add ament_cmake_python in the package.xml file and nothing else...
