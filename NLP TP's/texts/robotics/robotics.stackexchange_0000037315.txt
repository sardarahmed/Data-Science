Q:

adding switch to final link

I am trying to use and external library foo.a and I was told by the manufacturer to  add -lnetpbm as a switch to your final link.  as I am getting
Linking CXX executable bin/fr_cam
/home/scott/focusrobotics/release_20120111/lib/libfrdev.a(FrImage.o): In function FrImage': /home/scott/focusrobotics/release_20120111/src/libfrdev/FrImage.cpp:226: undefined reference to pm_openr'
how do I do what he suggests?
