Q:

How can I get real-time input from user?

Hi everyone!
I'm trying to print a statement on the command line and then get inputs (strings to be more specific) from the user while my package is running. I'm writing my node in Python. Is there anyway to do this? I now this seems trivial, but I'm new to ROS and couldn't find anything regarding this problem on the web.
Thanks.
P.s. I tried print '....' but it doesn't print anything on the command line. I tried n=raw_input() but my node crashes.

Are you trying to run this python file with rosrun or with roslaunch?

A:

As HenryW already said, you can use the normal python method, for example
#!/usr/bin/env python

from rospy import init_node, is_shutdown

if __name__ == '__main__':

  init_node('input_test')

  while not is_shutdown():

      print "gimme something, please?"
      something = raw_input()
      print "thanks for giving me " + something

compiling this node and then running it leads to
gimme something, please?
beer
thanks for giving me beer
gimme something, please?
box
thanks for giving me box
gimme something, please?
plant
thanks for giving me plant
gimme something, please?

If this doesn't work for you, update your question with your code and error messages.
