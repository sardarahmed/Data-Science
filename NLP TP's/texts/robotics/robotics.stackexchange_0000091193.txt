Hi all )))
Sorry, if my question have been repeated but I haven't found the solution(

I wrote this

Building dependency tree

A:

gmapping has not been released into Melodic, so that's why you can't install it using apt-get.
See #q303253, #q296170 and wiki/slam_gmapping. Notice how the wiki page has no version button for melodic. The status page for Melodic also doesn't show any gmapping packages (meaning it hasn't been released).
As far as I understand there are also no plans to release it for Melodic. I can't find a reference, but I believe the idea is that other packages (such as Google's Cartographer) are much more powerful and feature complete, or at least much better maintained.
If you really want/need gmapping on Melodic, you could attempt a from-source build.
You may refer to #q300480 for a workflow that resulted in a successful build at the time the answer was written.
