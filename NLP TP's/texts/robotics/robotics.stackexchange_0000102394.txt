Q:

MD5sum Error: Client Topic Datatype Mismatch

I am running the sciurus17 sample code file. After running this launch file, when I try to echo the contents of any /move_group/.... topic, I receive the following error:
[ERROR] [1663154112.847994876]: Client [/move_group] wants topic /move_group/goal to have datatype/md5sum [moveit_msgs/MoveGroupActionGoal/152e336e337dce7cbe639f1bd9c65def], but our version has [moveit_msgs/MoveGroupActionGoal/b7138704cefd43a8dd9758d697350b85]. Dropping connection.

RuntimeError: Unable to connect to move_group action server 'move_group' within allotted time (5s)

This was working perfectly some time ago while I was running the Move Group C++ Interface Tutorial and suddenly stopped working. I would be very grateful if someone could help me figure this out.
I need to access these topics (more specifically move_group/display_planned_path) in order to find the joint velocity for a particular joint in a path planned by moveit. Any workarounds to achieve this will also be much appreciated.
Setup:
Ubuntu 20.04
ROS noetic

Have you tried typing md5sum into the search box at the top of this page?

I tried to synchronize the moveit versions of the two computers but still got this error, I tried to search for mu5dm on the two computers, but the mu5dm on one is all in the env of anaconda, and the other computer has only one mu5dm file

A:

All your ros hosts need to run the same release of ros. This error happens when your nodes are using moveit_msgs from two different versions of ros.
Another possibility is that a source code package in catkin_ws contains a file named MoveGroup.action, and it's from an older version of ros. You need to delete this conflicting moveit_msgs package and use the official one from the /opt/ros/noetic/ tree.
You will need to do a clean build of your catkin_ws after deleting any packages.
update: fixed file name
