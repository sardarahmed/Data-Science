Q:

Advantages of Dynamixel X -T / -R TTL vs RS-485

I'm planning to buy servos for a humanoid robot that I control with ROS, is there any disadvantage of the TTL vs RS-485 versions? EMC/Electric disturbance / how many servos on one line/bus are possible... or others?

Thank you for your inquiry about Dynamixels.
Simply, the advantage of using RS-485 is more robustness when you need to long long communication line. If you have a plan to make humanoid robot, you could use TTL rather than RS-485.
And you can use Dynamixels up to 200 connected with additional power.
I think below link might good example for you.
