Q:

Where is there a canned disparity image to point cloud function?

e.g.
giveMeAPointCloud( disparity_image, camera_info, *point_cloud)
where cloud is the output. I don't really care whether cloud is pcl::PointCloud or sensor_msgs::PointCloud2.
Is this nicely exposed and available somewhere?

A:

There's no direct library call to do that currently, but you can use the stereo_image_proc/PointCloud2 nodelet. If you really need to just call a function, you can look at the source code. This creates a sensor_msgs::PointCloud2.
