Q:

ZED VO vs Rtabmap VO

I'm using ZED cameras and also running Rtabmap. Both systems have visual odom available. What are the pros and cons of using ZED VO instead of rtabmap? Do I get gains from using one over the other?

A:

The ZED VO is likely much tuned for the ZED than what one will accomplish with the more generic Rtabmap VO, I recall having decent results with the ZED VO node.
