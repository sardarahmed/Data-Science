Q:

Get topic rate from my node

Hi all! I have a node subscribed to a topic. In principle, the topic rate is constant but unknown from the node. Does exist a method to get the rate of this topic from my node program? Something similar to use "$rostopic hz" from console but from the code program.
Thanks in advance!

A:

rostopic has an API as documented on the wiki page (http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic). However, it does give a warning that "This library is for internal-use only as the code API may change, though it does provide examples of how to implement dynamic subscription and publication behaviors in ROS." so your mileage may vary.

Thank you very much, this is that I'm looking for (ROSTopicHz class). However, your reflexion is very interesting and maybe I should implement directly an initial callback to estimate the topic rate and after that replace it for the original, better than use this class directly. Thanks alee!
