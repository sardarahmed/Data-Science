Q:

How find bag files in Ubuntu

Hi All,
I recorded a .bag file and then played it and it worked.Now I cannot find where it is saved in my filesystem.Any suggestion?
Also maybe I messed around with something because now it is showing this error:
sam@sam-ThinkStation-P300:~/catkin_ws$ rosbag info sadrecord.bag
ERROR reading sadrecord.bag: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'sadrecord.bag'
