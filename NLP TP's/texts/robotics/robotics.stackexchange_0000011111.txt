Q:

Implementation of the Control of a Quadrotor, as taught in Aerial Robotics in Coursera

I completed the course of Aerial Robotics in Coursera and I want to implement what I learned in a real quadrotor. The thing is that when I see the equations given like this:

For the sake of the argument let's assume I have implemented the PD Controllers and every moment I find u1 (the sum of the forces applied to the quadrotor) and u2 (the sum of the moments applied to the quadrotor). I then ask myself: How can I find what force and moment should specifically each one of the motors produce? And here I am stuck as I can't find an answer.Could anyone help?  

A:

If i've understood your question correctly, you are trying to convert the desired set of moments and total force which you calculated from a hypothetical pd controller into a set of forces. This is the relation that needs to be solved
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1\\
\mathbf{u}_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&1&1&1\\
0&L&0&-L\\
-L&0&L&0\\
\gamma&-\gamma&\gamma&-\gamma
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
F_1\\
F_2\\
F_3\\
F_4\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $u_1$ is the total force of all motors and $\mathbf{u}_2$ is the vector of moments acting on the system. This can simply be solved for by inverting this matrix. So
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1&1&1&1\\
0&L&0&-L\\
-L&0&L&0\\
\gamma&-\gamma&\gamma&-\gamma
\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
u_1\\
\mathbf{u}_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
F_1\\
F_2\\
F_3\\
F_4\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
