Q:

Is Exact Time Sync Policy the default policy for Time Synchronizer?

Hi,
What is the difference between the time synchronizer and the exact time sync policy under message filter. In message_filters does both example 4.2 and 7.2  have the same outcome?
I might have overlooked something or might not be looking at this correctly.
Thanking you,
Benny

A:

Yes; they're the same.
I think this is a historical artifact; the TimeSynchronizer was probably written first, and then the policy-based synchronizer was written later, but the TimeSynchronizer was kept to preserve the existing API. If I remember correctly, the TimeSynchronizer is implemented using an exact time policy synchronizer.

Would you recommend using policy synchronizer over TimeSynchronizer?
