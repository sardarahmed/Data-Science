Q:

"Stage" package not compiling. OS X 10.8

While I am trying to install ROS on my Mac with OS X 10.8, XCode 5.0.2, The package "Stage" fails to compile in the process. It says  the following : (stream gisted at https://gist.github.com/karthikkovalam/11205070)
-- checking for one of the modules 'playercore>=2.1.0'
--   * Player not detected. If Player is installed but not detected, check your PKG_CONFIG_PATH.

I am not sure on how to handle this. I tried to install PlayerStage on my machine with "brew install player" and it failed with the following error stream. (Gisted at https://gist.github.com/karthikkovalam/11205137)
Please help in this regards. Thanks in advance.

For the record, Iam using stage on 10.9 just fine, no problems as far as I could remember.

A:

The player not found is a red herring, the real problem is that it cannot find libtool:
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
LTDL_INCLUDE_DIR
   used as include directory in directory /Users/Siva/ros_catkin_ws/src/stage

LTDL_LIB
    linked by target "stage" in directory /Users/Siva/ros_catkin_ws/src/stage/libstage

This is the code which looks for those variables:
https://github.com/ros-gbp/stage-release/blob/upstream/CMakeLists.txt#L75-77
I cannot reproduce this problem on my machine though, so I'm not sure what is causing your problem.
Player not build I can reproduce, but that is something you would need to take up on the homebrew-simulation issue tracker:

Works after I installed libtool. As you told, that was a red herring. Thanks a lot.
