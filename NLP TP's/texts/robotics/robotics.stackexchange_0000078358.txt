Q:

How to limit the moving range of interactive markers?

I'm following the Interactive Markers tutorial, is there anyway that we could set a limit to the interactive markers? For example, we just want to move them within some specific closed region.

I've seen this done, so I know it's possible, but I'm not sure how it was done.

A:

Ok, I managed to update the marker pose back to last saved position if I detect it is moved (by user) out of pre-defined limited region. We can set it in a callback insalled for the interactive marker server!
