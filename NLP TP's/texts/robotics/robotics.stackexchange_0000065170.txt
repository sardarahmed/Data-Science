Q:

how to remove top border from rviz::Panel

How can I remove the top area from a custom rviz plugin?
For example, how do I remove the top area with minimize and close button for TeleopPanel. This is the case for Tools, but its not a QWidget

A:

The best way to go forward with customization is to use rviz as a library http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/librviz_tutorial/html/index.html
