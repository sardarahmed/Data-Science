Q:

What is the base frame in velodyne's transform_nodelet?

I would like to transform the Velodyne LIDAR data before publishing it as a point cloud.
If I understand correctly the purpose of TransformNodelet in velodyne package is exactly this. In order to perform this transformation I have to publish a new frame that will be used by the TransformNodelet. For example:
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 /what_is_this /my_frame 500
My problem is I do not know what is the base frame. Do anybody know what is its name?

A:

The frame ID of the device is determined by the frame_id parameter passed to the driver. The default is /velodyne, but you can set it however you like.
The frame_id parameter passed to the transform nodelet (or node) sets the frame ID into which the data will be converted. The default is /odom, which is the ROS convention recommended by REP-0103 for mobile platforms. You can set that however you like, as well.

Thank you, it works now. I also had to fix something in the code. I will create a patch as soon as possible.
Update: Fixed.

Thanks. I joined this group to say you thank you. Where can i see the frame id for velodyne? I never could found that.

If  you look at the header.frame_id of any message published, that is the one the driver was configured to use.
