Q:

ros2 import tf2_geometry_msgs

Hello there,
I am unable to import  tf2_geometry_msgs  as an python3 module in ros2 eloquent.
Only tf2_ros, tf2_py and tf2_msgs seem to be a python module.
I am porting an melodic project to eloquent and we used the comfortable do_transform_vector3 function of that script.
Someone else seems to have a similar issue with c++: link (Maybe its completely unrelated though)
Am I missing something here?

A:

The python part of tf2_geometry_msgs has not been ported to ROS 2 yet. There's more info here: https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/issues/285#issuecomment-670073323
In short, it's not importable because the ROS 2 version of python_orocos_kdl has not been ported.
