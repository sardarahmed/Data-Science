Q:

Support for ROS2 Dashing along with python3

I have built the geometry library for my project using colcon for ROS2 Dashing and Python 3 and sourced it using source install/setup.bash but am getting this error on importing the TransformListener from tf2_ros:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "ros_pp.py", line 12, in <module>
  from tf2_ros.src.tf2_ros.transform_listener import TransformListener
File "../../../src/geometry2/tf2_ros/src/tf2_ros/__init__.py", line 39, in <module>
  from buffer_interface import *
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'buffer_interface'

My directory structure is as follows:
-workspace
         - build
         - install
         - src
                -  my_module
                          - src
                              - file.py
                -  geometry2

It would be great if anyone could help me know where exactly the error is coming from.
I have asked the same thing on GitHub. I can remove it if that's an issue.

This has been answered on GitHub.
The Python part of tf2_ros has not been ported to ROS 2 yet. There is an on-going effort: https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/pull/99
