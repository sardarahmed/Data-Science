Q:

Qxcb connection on rosrun turtlesim

Hi all,
I am following the beginner rosnode tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes
I have installed ros in bash. When I enter command "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node" after running "roscore", I get the following error:
QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display :0.0
Aborted (core dumped) 

Are there any solutions to this?
Thanks

Hi,
I'm a beginner in Ros and just started the tutorial too.Moreover I'm working on SLAM methods with ROS. Maybe ur still interested in this topic and would like to discuss with me about it.
Comment by Isam Abdullah on 2018-05-23:
Yeah sure. I would be happy to help/discuss.
Comment by kathrin@ros on 2018-05-23:
I'm a total beginner. But did you manage this connection problem?
Comment by Isam Abdullah on 2018-05-23:
Are you installing ros in windows bash? If so, then it is not supported and you have to do alot of hacks to make it work on that.

So it is advisable for a beginner to work in ubuntu.
Comment by kathrin@ros on 2018-05-23:
Yes, I did. I managed it with Xserver, seems to be stable.It seems more complicated to me to change to ubuntu...
Comment by Isam Abdullah on 2018-05-23:
Great!... btw are you university/college graduate?
Comment by kathrin@ros on 2018-05-23:
Did you installed ubuntu additionally to windows?Does it work well parallel?
Comment by Isam Abdullah on 2018-05-23:
Yes... It works well to have dual boot. Windows and ubuntu side by side.

Comment by Isam Abdullah on 2018-05-23:
Well, I have graduated from my BS computer science previous year. I have been working in a startup related to computer vision and deep learning since the past year.
Comment by kathrin@ros on 2018-05-23:
Sounds great. I've tried to run ubuntu on/as a live stick. But I didn't know how to access ros,not knowing where it is located on the hard disk or haven't set any path variable. How did you run ubuntu and how to get access to the ros without downloading it again?
Thanks in advance.

A:

I have installed ros in bash

do you mean Windows 10 / WSL with this? If so, then that is highly experimental and especially anything with a GUI will require (quite) some tweaks. Are you running a Windows X server fi?

Yes, I mean Windows 10/WSL. I don't know if I am running a Windows X server fi. Please help me on the tweaks..
Comment by Isam Abdullah on 2017-05-26:
Hi, thanks for the answer. I searched the windows X server thing, and I found the fix.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-05-26:
Could you please mention your platform next time you post a question?
And also: please take into account that what you're doing (ROS on Win10/WSL) is completely unsupported.
If you are just starting out I'm not sure using such a platform would be something I'd recommend.
Comment by Isam Abdullah on 2017-05-26:
I would surely. Thanks

Can you please share the tweaks you did to make this run? Thanks in advance!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-09-08:
I'm afraid I don't remember. The situation with ROS on WSL is rather different now as well as the main obstacles have been removed. See #q238646.

With a W10 PC, you need to install Xming to run GUI https://www.pcworld.com/article/3055403/windows/windows-10s-bash-shell-can-run-graphical-linux-applications-with-this-trick.html I managed to run at least Firefox, but I'm still having some challenge with "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node"
