Q:

Famous scientists in the Nazi party

Can anyone give a list of famous scientists in the Nazi Party? Is there a complete list? 

A:

The most famous mathematicians who were the members of NSDAP are Ludwig Bieberbach and Oswald Teichmüller.

A:

The mathematician who would have been famous had he not been a member of the SS / Nazi Party and died in a POW camp is, I think, Gerhard Gentzen. He invented/rigourously described natural deduction and sequent calculus but is well written out of the history
In philosophy circles, in debates between analytic philosophers (logic) and continental philosophers, sometimes there are discussions about who was worse — Heidegger or Frege. Frege died before WW2 so Heidegger is worse. These questions are related to which philosophy — analytical or continental — is the easiest misused for bad goals
But, if Gentzen was known, the question would be between Heidegger or Gentzen and the question could have a different answer.
I have a book on natural deduction (Logic by Paul Tomassi) it mentions lot of people involved in its development, but Gentzen is missing.

A:

Philip Lenard, who with Stark founded the Deutsche Physik movement.
There are also examples of scientists who claimed to be "nominal members only": Wernher von Braun comes to mind (even if he admitted knowing about the slave labor used to construct the V-2 rockets); he was not only a member of the Nazi party but also of the SS.
