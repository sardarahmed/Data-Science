Q:

When and why were mathematics and magic considered synonymous in England

In 1555, John Dee was arrested for "calculating". According to his MacTutor biography: 

At this time mathematics in England was considered to be equivalent to the possession of magical powers and Aubrey writes that the authorities had "... burned mathematical books for conjuring books."

In our society it seems astonishing that performing calculations could be taken to be magic. When and why did the association between mathematics and calculation begin, was it peculiar to England, and when and why did it end?

A:

Surely it was not peculiar to England. Saint Augustine wrote "The good Christian should beware of mathematicians, and all those who make empty prophecies. The danger already exists that the mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and to confine man in the bonds of Hell" (De Genesi ad Litteram, Book II, xviii, 37, according to this source). 
I think that from the IV century a.D. onwards mathematics - besides the bare minimum for everyday calculations - was especially associated with astrology, and therefore with magic. Johannes Kepler and Girolamo Cardano are the latest names which come into my mind, so probably it ended with the beginning of the XVII century.
