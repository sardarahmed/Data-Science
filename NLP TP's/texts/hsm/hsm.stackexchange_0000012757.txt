Who were the mathematicians who hated teaching in class or disliked teaching?
From  this Article:
Gauss hated teaching, and believed some students robbed him of his time.
From this  Article:
Perelman hated teaching in class.  He decided to work alone same like Isaac Newton so he left a U.S. university and went to his native country Russia, where he was paid less than a hundred dollars per month.
Are there any others?

A:

One example is Sidney Coleman, though he was a theoretical physicist and not a mathematician. In an interview, he said:

I hate [teaching]. You do it as part of the job. Well, that's of course false ... or maybe more true than false when I say I hate it. ... But I certainly would be just as happy if I had no graduate students. ... Occasionally there is a graduate student who is a joy to collaborate with. Both David Politzer and Erick Weinberg were of this kind, but they were essentially almost mature physicists. They were very bright by the time they came to me. In general, working with a graduate student is like teaching a course. It's tedious, unpleasant work. A pain in the neck. You do it because you're paid to do it. If I weren't paid to do it I certainly would never do it.2
