Q:

Who did the drawings in Hilbert's and Cohn-Vossen's "Anschauliche Geometrie"?

Hilbert's and Cohn-Vossen's wonderful book "Anschauliche Geometrie" ("Geometry and the Imagination") from 1932 contains a lot of great illustrations which, given the time of publication, must have been drawn by hand.  I couldn't find a mention in the book about who did them.  (The photos of the 3D models are mentioned, but not the drawings unless I missed it somehow.)
Does anyone know who created the drawings and how they were made at that time?  Was it some unknown graphical artists or maybe Cohn-Vossen himself?

A:

I agree with you that the range of demonstrations and illustrations makes it a fascinating book. 
According to Hilbert's preface dated 1932 from Göttingen, in the English translation:

The line diagrams have all been drawn by K. H. Naumann and  H. Bödeker
  (Göttingen). The photographic pictures were taken  by W. Jentzsch
  (Göttingen), and the models he photographed  belong to the collection
  of the Göttingen Mathematical Institute. 

I couldn't find out anything else about the illustrators Naumann & Bödeker.
