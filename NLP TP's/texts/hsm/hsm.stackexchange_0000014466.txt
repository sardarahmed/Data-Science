Q:

Simplest of the many proofs the prime harmonic series diverges

Over the history of mathematics, some key facts have had multiple and different proofs developed for them. Sometimes these different proofs provide a unique insight or understanding of those facts.
For example, the infinitude of primes has an ancient proof probably due to Euclid, as well as more modern proofs such as those based on Euler's product formula, and hence the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. I'm not skilled enough to understand the additional insight that the elementary proof of the prime number theorem provided.

I am searching for the simplest proof of the fact that the prime harmonic series diverges:
$$ \sum\frac{1}{p} = \infty $$
By simple, I mean requiring the least knowledge beyond secondary school mathematics.
I would be happy with a proof based on complex analysis if it is simple and elegant. I would also be happy to accept as prerequisites, if required, that the harmonic series diverges, and the Basel series converges.

The proof set out here (link) is simple but in my opinion inelegant.
I have tried to read this article by Eynden surveying several proofs and none seem simple. Erdos' proof is described as simple but I have tried several times, and failed to comprehend it.

A:

The simplest proof is Euler's original proof. It is based on the identity
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}=\prod_{p}\left(1-p^{-s}\right)^{-1}, s>1.$$
This identity is equivalent to existence and uniqueness of decomposition
of integers into products of primes.
Now when $s\to 1+$, the LHS tends to $\infty$ (since the harmonic series is divergent), so the RHS must become divergent as $s=1$, that is
$$\sum\frac{1}{p}=\infty,$$
by the elementary convergence criterion for infinite products.
No complex analysis involved. Only convergence criteria for series and products with positive terms.

A:

This is my favorite way to present Euler's proof:
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic:
$$\prod_{p \leq N} \left(1+\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p^{2}}+\cdots\right) \geq 1+\frac{1}{2}+ \cdots+\frac{1}{N}$$
for any positive integer $N$.
If $N>2$,
$$1+\frac{1}{2}+ \cdots+\frac{1}{N} > 1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{N-1} \geq \int_{1}^{N} \frac{1}{t} \, dt = \log N.$$
Provided that $e^{2x}>\frac{1}{1-x}$ for any $x \in (0, 0.5]$, it follows that
$$ \log N < \prod_{p \leq N} \left(1+\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p^{2}}+\cdots\right) = \prod_{p \leq N} \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{p}} < \prod_{p \leq N} e^{\frac{2}{p}}.$$
Therefore,
$$ \sum_{p \leq N}\frac{1}{p} > \frac{\log \log N}{2}$$
for any integer $N>2$ and we are done.
