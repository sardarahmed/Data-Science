Q:

Origin of the smooth but nowhere real analytic function built with dyadic rationals

I found the following interesting function and its analysis at Non-analytic smooth function article in Wikipedia. I include a screen capture below for those who don't wish to navigate away:

I could not find a clear reference in the article as to the source of this example. Hence my question:

Question: who found the example above ?

I found the Fabius function article gives another example of a smooth but nowhere analytic function after reading this great MSE question but I need a reference for the nameless example I post above. Thanks in advance for your insight on this matter.

A:

Mandelbrojt (1942, p. 2) has $\displaystyle f(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\sqrt{n!}}\cos(n!x)$, with a very similar proof.
