Q:

Did Euler produce any Russian text?

According to Wikipedia, Euler (1707-1783) "mastered Russian and settled into life in Saint Petersburg" in 1727. Did he produce any text in Russian, either mathematical or personal?
On The Euler Archive, I can only find writings in Latin, German, and French (maybe I just did not search hard enough).

A:

Yes, Euler wrote letters in Russian:

(Euler's letter to Nartov, June 18, 1743)
Interestingly, he signed papers as "Леонгардъ Эулеръ", a direct transliteration of his name, not how he is called in Russian today (imitating pronunciation).
