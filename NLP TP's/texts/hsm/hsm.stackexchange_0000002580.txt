Q:

English translation of Omar Khayyám's mathematical work

Is there any current English translation of the mathematical works of Omar Khayyám?

A:

I am not sure that there is an adequate English translation of al-Khayyāmī's famous treatise on Algebra. If you read French there is a good scholarly translation by Roshdi Rashed et Ahmad Djebbar, "L’Oeuvre algébrique d’al-Khayyām", Aleppo 1981
