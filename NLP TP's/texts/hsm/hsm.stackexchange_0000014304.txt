Q:

Early uses of the word "operator" in mathematics

I'm looking for early uses of the word "operator" in mathematics and how it evolved to become a synonym for the modern "function" in certain areas. Jeff Miller's page only has an entry for "operation" and "operand".

A:

The unabridged Oxford Dictionary is of great help in such matters. It requires subscription. Here are the examples it provides since 1855.

Originally: (Mathematics) a symbol or group of symbols indicating an
operation or series of operations to be carried out, usually on a
following expression. Later also: a sign or symbol which effects other
types of operation, as logical, phonological, syntactic, etc.
1855  R. Carmichael Treat. Calculus of Operations 3   The
indetermination is due to a source quite independent of the character
of the functional operator.
1925   J. M. Bryant & J. A. Correll Alternating-current Circuits iii.
74   The operator, j = √(− 1), turns the vector through 90 degrees in
a counterclockwise direction each time it is used.
1952  Eng. & Germanic Stud. 4 12   We may regard Modern English stone
as the result of operating with an operator that I shall write {AS. ā
MnE. [ou]} on Anglo-Saxon stān.
1969   V. J. Calderbank Course on Programming in FORTRAN IV iii. 28
The relational expression..has the general form e1re2 where e1 and e2
are arithmetic expressions..being compared by one of the following
relational operators, r: .EQ. Equal to (=); .LT. Less than (<);
[etc.].
1990   Proc. London Math. Soc. 60 365   The centroid operator and the
projection operator are quite different. For example, the centroid
operator commutes with linear transformations, while the projection
operator does not.
