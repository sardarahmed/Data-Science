Q:

What are some concepts/discoveries in mathematics and science that found practical application years after they had been formulated/discovered?

I'm looking for examples of ideas/discoveries/concepts in Maths or Science that had no practical application at first and were maybe considered as nothing but a theoretical concept but they turned out to be useful years after?
I think that imaginary numbers may be such a thing - it's written on Wikipedia that "The name "imaginary number" was coined in the 17th century as a derogatory term, as such numbers were regarded by some as fictitious or useless." - and now they are very common in Physics and Maths, right? What about some other examples?

A:

I would probably say number theory, which had quite a lot of work on theorems regarding prime numbers that (as far as I know) did not get much use until the development of cryptography, such as the RSA algorithm from the 70's using Fermat's little theorem from the 1640's.

A:

Radon's transform is a good recent example. It was discovered in 1917 by Johann Radon. Computer tomography is based on it. 
But actually there are plenty of examples. The most famous is the theory of conic sections which had no practical purpose until Kepler found that they describe orbits of celestial bodies.
Linear programming can be traced back to Cauchy and Fourier, but real practical applications begin in the middle 20s century.

A:

Most of the stuff Einstein worked on can come under this category. For example, people did have any use of the relativity theory in daily life before Global Positioning System came around. Similarly, we do not yet know how to exploit the wormholes (which are allowed by modern physics) but one day might.
