Q:

"Tension" between Electromagnetism and Newton's laws

When talking about the inconsistencies in physics that led up to Einstein's discovery of relativity today's professors always say that Maxwell's discovery of the constant speed of light  $c$ created a huge contradiction in physics. (namely: was there a special frame relative to which the speed of light was $c$ OR were the laws of EM wrong). 
My question is why didn't the scientists realize something was wrong right when the law saying that the magnetic force on a body was proportional to it's velocity was first proposed? someone had to ask "velocity relative to which observer" right? if they did realize something was wrong, why did they continue to use it in mainstream physics?

A:

someone had to ask "velocity relative to which observer" right?

They thought it was relative to the frame of the aether. People like Lorentz also knew ca. 1880-1895 that any observable effect of motion relative to the aether would vanish until you got to at least order $(v/c)^4$. They understood that the electric and magnetic fields would transform when you changed frames. They just didn't know that it was possible to make the form of Maxwell's equations exactly frame-independent by doing what Einstein did in his 1905 paper. It was a very radical and surprising step that Einstein took. Before 1905, people like Lorentz conceived of things like the Lorentz transformation in terms of stresses and strains generated by the motion of matter through the aether.
