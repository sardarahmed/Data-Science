Q:

Old square bracket notation for units

As discussed in this answer https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/77691/667 there are several common conventions for the notation $[q]$ of a physical quantity $q$. 
However, I often see people to put the square brackets around the (SI-) unit itself. For example $[\mathrm{kg}]$ (for kilogram). Most time the people using this are over 50 years old and often engineers. So, I got the impression that this convention was common some years ago.
So, what are the origins and reasons for this old convention?

A:

The German DIN Norm 461 from 1973 explicitly says, that units must not be put in brackets and further relates to DIN 1313. The first version of DIN 461 is from 1923.

Die Einheit darf keinesfalls in Klammern gesetzt werden (siehe DIN1313)

According to DIN, the square brackets are used as an operator to extract the unit from a physical quantity and curly brackets are used to extract the number:
m = 5 kg
{m} = 5
[m] = kg
In that context [kg] does not make sense.
Therefore, the idea of not using units in (square) brackets is quite old.
I just had a look at some papers from the 1980s. Both notations occurred  there. Therefore, the idea to use units inside brackets is quite old, too.
Would be interesting to know which of the notations is older. Has the square bracket notation around units already been used before 1923?

A:

It is a habit of text books and handbooks (of engineering branches as well as of chemistry and even physics) to indicate the unit of numerical values given in tables by column headings like "m [kg]" or "m in kg". The mathematically correct way is "m/kg" since if the mass is m = 3 kg, then the numerical value is clearly 3 = m/kg. But even when students are told this, I see often the aformentioned habit show through. This might be the reason for further [ab]use of square brackets. (It is not distorting. We know what is meant.)
