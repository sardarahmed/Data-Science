Q:

Is the article reporting the first cell phone still around?

At around the 3 min mark in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6gNeKjC9Cc, Dr. Martin Cooper, the inventor of the first cell phone says that he made the first phone call on 4/3/73 to impress a journalist. Could anyone provide a link to the article that was written by this journalist?
