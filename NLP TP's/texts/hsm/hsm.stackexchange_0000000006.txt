Q:

When did the names of scientists first become the names of scientific units?

Many scientific units are named after scientists, for example,

Tesla for magnetic flux

Farad for capacitance

Newton for force.

When did the tradition of naming scientific units begin?

A:

History of the metric system - Wikipedia says:

In 1861, Charles Bright and Latimer Clark proposed the names of ohm, volt, and farad in honour of Georg Ohm, Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday respectively for the practical units based on the centimetre-gramme-second absolute system. This was supported by Thomson (Lord Kelvin). These names were later scaled for use in the Practical System. The concept of naming units of measure after noteworthy scientists was subsequently used for other units.
