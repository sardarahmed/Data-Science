Q:

Why isn't "thermodynamics" replaced with "thermostatics"?

In thermodynamics, one primarily studies systems that are in so-called "thermal equilibrium", a state in which certain prescribed "thermodynamic" quantities such as temperature, heat, chemical potential, etc. are considered static in time. In fact, most modern textbooks admit that the study of systems not in thermal equilibrium is extremely complicated, and is the primary focus of fields such as nonlinear dynamics.
With this in mind, why isn't thermodynamics called thermostatics? If this were done, then we would have a proper word for the study of systems that are out of thermal equilibrium, thermodynamics.
I know that, historically, thermodynamics was the study of heat and engines and such, so I can see where it got its name from. However, I don't see why it hasn't changed its name since then. Thermodynamics as is currently taught has been around for over 100 years!

A:

Thermodynamics really studies CHANGES of states, not just the states themselves.
These changes are slow. The technical term is "adiabatic". It started with
Carnot cycle, describing the action of a heat engine. A heat engine cycle passes through several different states.
