Q:

Who used the symbol $S_n$ for "rotation reflection" as a symmetry operation?

I am looking for the origin of the symbol $S_n$ used by chemists to denote the symmetry operation consisting of a $\smash{\frac{2\pi}n}$ rotation ($C_n$) about an axis and a reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis.
Google Scholar traces earliest use of the operation’s name “Drehspiegelung” to A. Schoenflies’, Krystallsysteme und Krystallstructur (1891). However, that book does not seem to denote it $S_n$.
Physics books on molecular structure had $S_n$ by the 1930s: an early use can be seen in L. Tisza, Zur Deutung der Spektren mehratomiger Moleküle (1933, p. 59), so it must have started earlier.
(N.B.: Symbols like $\mathrm C_n$, $\mathrm S_n$ can also denote symmetry groups. This should not be confused with the notation for symmetry operations or “elements” — see e.g. this table.)

Some data points from the convoluted history of rotatory-reflection (RR) and its notation:

Bravais (a classmate of Galois) was among the first to consider orthogonal symmetry of crystals. His papers (1849, p. 144; 1850, p. 93) introduce notation for the rotations ($\Lambda^n$ or $\mathrm L^n$ according as the axis is “principal” or not) and also for plane and central reflections ($\Pi$, $\mathrm P$, $\mathrm C$). But none for RR, which he deliberately disregards on grounds that the extra crystal class it allows “doesn’t seem to occur in Nature” (1851, pp. 229–230, 275), though he does mention (p. 237) a shape with such symmetry, viz. Naumann’s sphenoid (a.k.a. Breithaupt’s tetragonal sphenohedron, from σφήν $=$ wedge):

Gadolin (often credited with first deducing the 32 crystal classes) does consider RR under the name sphenoidal symmetry (and thus gets the “tetragonal-(di)sphenoidal class” Bravais had missed) (1871, pp. 18, 28). He apparently has no symbol for the operation.
Curie (also credited with deducing the 32 classes) completes Bravais’ notation by writing $\Pi^n$ for RR, which he calls plane of alternating symmetry of order $n$ (1884, pp. 430, 442, 453; 1885):

$\hspace{4.5em}$

Minnigerode (also credited) calls RR a symmetry of the second kind. He has no symbol for it, as he prefers to use rotatory-inversion (1884, pp. 203, 213; 1887, pp. 151, 162). 
Schoenflies briefly calls RR an operation $\smash{\mathfrak S(\frac{2\pi}n)}$ in (1889, p. 175), then switches to $\smash{\overline{\mathfrak A}(\frac{2\pi}n)}$ and the name Drehspiegelung in his influential book (1891, pp. 29, 49) and Encyklopädie article (1906, p. 444). His later papers keep that notation, e.g. (1926, p. 219).
Fedorov calls RR combined symmetry, without symbol (1892, pp. 27–28). This terminology is adopted by e.g. Swartz (1909, pp. 374–377), Jellinek (1915, pp. 355–361).
Viola calls an RR axis Spiegeldrehachse, without symbol (1904, p. 246).
Auerbach in Handbuch der Physik calls an RR axis Spiegeldrehachse, symbol $\color{red}{S_n}$ (1908, p. 58).
Voigt calls an RR axis in direction $r$ Spiegelachse, symbol $S_r$; or Drehspiegelachse, symbol $\mathfrak S$ (1910, pp. 66–77; 1918, pp. 245, 333–336).
Rinne calls rotations Gyralen and RR Gyroiden, without symbol; in a later edition he denotes them $\mathrm G_n$ and $\underline G{}_n$  (1912, p. 1; 1922, p. 1).
Rogers calls RR rotatory-reflection, symbol $ap_{2\pi/n}$ (1912, pp. 5, 7; 1926, pp. 167–171; 1935, p. 478).
Ewald in Handbuch der Physik calls an RR axis Drehspiegelachse, symbol $\color{red}{S_n}$. In a footnote about the nomenclature (of both operations and groups), he adds: “As experience showed that misunderstandings can hardly result, a simplified spelling of Latin letters and subscripted symmetry indices established itself, which has also been applied here” (1927, pp. 199, 203, 206). He edited Zeitschrift für Kristallographie.
Wigner adopts Ewald’s Handbuch notation (1930, p. 139).

The linked papers of Swartz (1909) and Rogers (1926) have nice historical accounts in English. In decreasing order of likelihood, I’d say that the $S$ in $S_n$ seems to come from 1) Spiegeldrehachse, 2) sphenoidal, or 3) Schoenflies’ ephemeral $\mathfrak S$.
