Q:

Request: Readers to Check Accuracy of the History in my Young Adult Math Story

I'm writing a young adult math story, Althea and the Mystery of the Imaginary Numbers.
Her mom tells her about Scipione del Ferro, Antonio Fior, Tartaglia, Cardano, and Ferrari. And they do some math together.
I hope it's ok to ask for help here. This seems like the best place to find math historians who might be willing to help me.
Here's my current draft.
Do I have the history right (pages 17 to 42)? I have done lots of research, but the sources disagree often. My original source for the story of the discovery/creation of the cubic formula is a chapter in Journey Through Genius.

This is the central point of many popular stories about cubic equations. But this is just not true. If Cardano formula have square roots of negative numbers, you can't just simplify it  to get rid of them and calculate the roots. So, if your goal is to actually calculate the roots of this particular cubic, then Cardano's formula is pretty useless. Sorry. Luca Pacioli was right after all - there is no general formula for cubic equations that uses radicals, at least in the sense known to Luca.
Here is an idea for your story to illustrate this point (sorry for taking liberty of using your character):
Althea accidentally travels back in time. She meets Ptolemy who is very excited to hear that cubic equations could be solved. Ptolemy is trying to compose trig table and wants to calculate $\cos 20°$. He knows $\cos 60°$ and knows the formula for $\cos(3x)$. So he knows that $\cos 20°$ is the solution of the equation
$$4x^3 - 3x = \frac 1 2.$$
But how to solve it?
Althea is very happy that she can help. She writes down the solution:
$$x = \frac 1 2 \left (
\sqrt[3]{\frac 1 2 + \frac {\sqrt {-3}} {2} } +
\sqrt[3]{\frac 1 2 - \frac {\sqrt {-3}} {2} } 
\right)
$$
Unfortunately Ptolemy is not used to our algebraic notations.
It took Althea a week to explain him what all symbols in the formula means, and finally Ptolemy starts to understand. But then Ptolemy noticed $\sqrt{-3}$. And asks what is it? Althea have to explain complex numbers. (But first of course she needs to explain negative numbers). It took a month, but Ptolemy is very patient, because he is eager to learn the science of the future to complete his trig table and to use it for his astronomy calculations. Finally he become fluent with complex numbers.
"But how do we calculate a cubic root of $ \frac 1 2 + \frac {\sqrt {3}} {2} i$?".
"We almost there! To calculate a cubic root of a complex number, you need to take a cubic root of its length and divide its angle by 3. You are in luck: the number $ \frac 1 2 + \frac {\sqrt {3}} {2} i $ has a very nice length: it is just 1. Cubic root of 1 is 1. And is has a very nice angle: it's just 60°. So the cubic root is just a number with the length 1 and the angle 20°. It's just $\cos 20^\circ +i \sin 20^\circ$. Is it nice?"
At this point Ptolemy understands that the future science is just a fraud and he just wasted his valuable time.
