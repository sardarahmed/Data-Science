Q:

Examples of mathematicians who applied to patent their work

MIT's RSA encryption was granted a patent although it was not enforced for non-commercial applications. Similarly for Stanford's PGP encryption algorithm.  However, these are institutions rather than mathematicians.
A borderline case of maths and physics would be Mauchly and Eckert unsuccessful application for a patent on their work relating to the ENIAC.  (There is an interesting backstory to this case which resulted in hostilities with von Neumann.)
Q: What are some examples of mathematicians who either successfully or unsuccessfully applied to patent their work?

A:

Unfortunately Penrose patented the tiles associated with his name.

A:

AT&T Bell Labs famously patented some aspects of KORBX, their implementation of an interior point method for LP based on Karmarkar's algorithm. Karmarkar was employed by AT&T.
