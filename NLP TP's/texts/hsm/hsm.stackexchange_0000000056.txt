Q:

When was the method of getting square roots (invented by Viète in 1610 and developed by Harriot in 1631) first taught to school children?

François Viète's On the Numerical Resolution of Powers by Exegetics published
in 1610 (Viete, 2006, pp. 311-370) introduced one way of numerically solving polynomial equations, a special case of which is the equation where the square of an unknown is equal to a given number.  Thomas Harriot's The Practice of the Analytic Art (Harriot, 1631) built upon Viète's work.
It seems that Viète's and Harriot's procedure is the basis of the manual decimal digit-by-digit method of obtaining square roots (as seen in Wikipedia, 2014).
I was taught this procedure when I was in elementary school.  My question is:

When was the manual decimal digit-by-digit method of obtaining square roots first taught to school children?

I'm looking for evidence such as a textbook containing the procedure and explicitly stating that children (say, those below 18 years of age) are the intended audience.

The linked second edition was published in 1740.  The first edition was 1727. (1725 for the original French: L'arithmétique rendue facile de façon à la pouvoir apprendre sans Maître)
The translator's preface explains it is for teaching children.
Calculating square roots digit by digit is pages 347-350.
