Q:

Origin of the term "field" (in "vector field")

I am reposting a thread from "physics stack exchange" :
I was wondering -
Why do we use the word "field" to describe a vector field? i.e., a field is "an expanse of open or cleared ground, especially a piece of land suitable or used for pasture or tillage" (from dictionary.com).
So, why historically this was the name chosen for the description of a function $F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$?
Thank you!

A:

From Mathword "Earliest Known Uses of
Some of the Words of Mathematics"

VECTOR FIELD is found in 1905 in “The Present Problems of Geometry” by Dr. Edward Kasner in Congress of Arts and Science, Universal Exposition, St. Louis, 1904: “The vector field deserves to be introduced as a standard form into geometry.”

We could investigate whether this was before or after the corresponding terms in physics, like  "magnetic field".
