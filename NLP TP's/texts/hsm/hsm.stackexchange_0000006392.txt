Q:

Name of a XIXth-century German scientist from the University of Berlin

In December 1892, the french mathematician Charles Hermite had a jubilee celebration. 
He received a number of letters and telegrams. One of them is from the members of the University of Berlin, see the following picture:
 
I can identify all but one name:
von Helmholtz (physicist), Weierstrass (mathematician), Kummer (mathematician), the missing one
von Bezold (physicist), E. Dubois-Reymond (physician), Kundt (physicist), H.W. Vogel (chemist), Fuchs (mathematician).

Can you identify the missing one? (It seems that it is something like S. S...ers)
