Q:

The reason why sheaf theory emerged

Motivation: In any history, there is a cause-and-effect relationship. So I became curious about the situation in which the sheaf theory came to appear. In other words, I'm curious about what problem was left unsolved and led to the emergence of sheaf as a solution. Or I wonder if sheaf emerged as a more minor concept in the progress of researching a certain concept.
Addition: I know that "Cousin problem" that Kiyoshi Oka contributed is related to sheaf theory. This thinking is right?

A:

Sheaves were created by Leray to avoid doing anything resembling applied mathematics while he was in a prisoner of war camp during World War II, as he was an expert on PDEs and did not want this to become known. Hence he turned his attention to algebraic topology.
For more details, see the notes by Haynes Miller here.
