Q:

Was Isaac Newton the first person to articulate the scientific method in Europe?

Newton is frequently seen as the founder of Western science. Was he the first person to explicitly articulate the scientific method?

A:

NO. See at least :

William Gilbert with De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (1600)
Galileo Galilei with e.g. the Sidereus Nuncius (1610)
William Harvey with Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus (1628)
René Descartes with Discours de la méthode. Pour bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la vérité dans les sciences (Discourse on the Method. An introduction to the Essais, which include the Dioptrique, the Météores and the Géométrie) (1637).

Note : "scientific method" is a vague concept: it is a "recipe" with various ingredients: observation, experiments, hypotheses, mathematization.
Observations, for example, are as old as mankind: for Europe, they date back at least to Ancient Greece : see Presocratic Philosophy.
The peculiar mixture of the ingredients is an Early Modern invention: we can find it fully mature into Newton's works, but Newton relies heavily on Galileo and Descartes.

A:

Usually Francis Bacon (1561-1626) is credited with "articulating the scientific method" in general, and not only "first in Europe", but just the first.
