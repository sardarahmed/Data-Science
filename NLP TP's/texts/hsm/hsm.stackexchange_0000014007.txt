Q:

Are there any portraits of Joseph Fourier other than this one?

Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier was a French mathematician and physicist who initiated the investigation of Fourier series. The following is the only portrait of Fourier that I know of. Are there any portraits of Fourier other than this one?

A:

Here is a caricature of Fourier and Legendre:
