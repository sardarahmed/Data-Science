Q:

Historical ways of *presenting* or axiomatizing the notion of a topological space

I've heard rumors in a couple of places that the modern presentation of a topology as $(X, \tau)$ where $X$ is our topological space and $\tau$ is our set of open sets is "somewhat" new and a simplification of how topologies used to be presented. We can also pick simple variants of this such as $(X, B)$ where $B$ is a basis or subbase and identify them with the modern presentation.
What are the different ways that topologies have been presented or defined over time?
This youtube video is a review of an old book called Elements of Point Set Topology, which defines a system of neighborhoods at each point. The neighborhood presentation is sort of confusing, but I think the way to map it back to a more modern presentation is to note that the union of all neighborhoods for every point forms a basis, based on this article on ProofWiki, but I am a little confused as to the intuition behind a neighborhood system.
My question is similar to this one, but is specifically about the old definitions that were out-competed in a sense.

A:

An early definition of topology is given in the book Kuratowski, Topology I
(first edition, 1933).
It is defined in terms of a "closure operator", $X\mapsto\overline{X}$
acting on the set of all subsets of a set, which satisfies 3 axioms:
$$\overline{(X\cup Y)}=\overline{X}\cup\overline{Y},\quad \overline{\overline{X}}=\overline{X},$$
and $\overline{X}=X$ when $X$ is one point or empty.
The modern definition was popularised by Bourbaki, and in English by Kelley, in his book General topology, in the early 1950s,
but it was already in use the 1920s, in the work of P. Aleksandrov and Urysohn, for example.
Aleksandrov, in his comments to the Russian edition of his work with Urysohn, credits the modern axioms to Hausdorff, Grundzuge der Mengenlehre, 1914, though his set of axioms included
the "Hausdorff axiom" which nowadays is not included in the general definition of a topological space. He writes (my translation from the Russian):

In subsequent development (after Hausdorff) of axioms of topological spaces, various notions were chosen as basic: closure (Kuratowski), open set (Aleksandrov), closed set (Sierpinski). All these approaches led to the same now universally accepted notion of a topological space ($T$-space), and undisputable credit for this belongs to Kuratowski.
