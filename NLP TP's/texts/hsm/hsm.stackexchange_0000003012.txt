Q:

Where to look for information on technological advances in lithium-ion batteries?

For my philosophy of science class, I'm looking for references that will provide a historical / science philosophical insight on the development and advances of lithium-ion batteries. For now, I imagine two types of such sources:

encyclopedias on technology. I will read Encyclopedia of Electrochemical Power Sources, will do my best to find something in the Encyclopedia of History of Technology or Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry. Any more books that I could look into?
review articles. For now, I have Goodenough, 2009, but that doesn't seem to be sufficient to me.

Am I missing any other types of references? I feel that I will possibly need something more on the philosophy of science side of things, not purely technical.

A:

I have written a report in question, though it turned out to be more on the history side than on the philosophy side, listing the important technological advances and breakthroughs. 
The best introduction to the history of lithium-ion batteries is the corresponding section of the Wikipedia article, which gives a good timeline of achievements. Also, this Nature article is important because it is the first mention of nanostructured materials for lithium-ion batteries.
My report is posted here for anyone interested.
