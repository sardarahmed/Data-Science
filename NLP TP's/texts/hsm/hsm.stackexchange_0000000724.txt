Q:

Was the convolution product invented or discovered?

In analysis textbooks and classes I sometimes see the convolution product introduced as a sort of artificial tool - just a clever method for constructing functions that somebody smart came up with at some point.
My question is, is this an accurate description of how it first came to light historically? That is, was the convolution product:

Discovered, in the sense that it arose naturally in a mathematics problem, given to the mathematician by nature, so to speak.
Invented, somebody went out of their way to develop a construction that would have certain properties.

To illustrate the difference between (1) and (2), consider the complex numbers (discovered accidentally as solutions to equations) and the quaternions (invented after years of painstaking labour specifically in order to suit some purpose).

A:

Neither was discovered nor invented. A particular form of the convolution operation arised "naturally" in the solution of diferential equations by certain definite integrals, as described on Section 1049 of Euler's book "Institutionum Calculi Integralis (Vol. 2)."
A more complete history of convolution product may be read on the paper "A History of the Convolution Operation" (http://pulse.embs.org/january-2015/history-convolution-operation/).
