Q:

Why did Schrödinger choose a cat for his thought experiment?

While Schrödinger's cat thought experiment serves a greater purpose than animal cruelty enjoyment, one of the possible results is a dead cat. Gruesome  or not is one's appreciation, but you will always find someone joking about "oh boy this guy must have hated cats".
Which leads to a simple question, why did Schrödinger choose a cat in the first place, instead of, say, a lamb or a goldfish?
The only thing I was able to find online so far is some idle-guessing-looking "Pictures of Cats" website which doesn't seem really trustworthy (here). Is there a more reliable source?

A:

Erwin Schrödinger doesn't appear to have personally owned a cat. He did however own a dog.

But even noises have their timbre, from which we may infer what is going on; and even my dog is familiar with the peculiar noise of the opening of a certain tin box, out of which he occasionally receives a biscuit.

His great-aunt owned several cats. He speaks disapprovingly of them on several occasions, making multiple references to "yowling" cats and making specific reference to a tomcat named Thomas Becket that seems to have made a particular impression on him.

An aunt of my mother's also lived there with her husband, Alfred Kirk,
and six Angora cats. (In later years there were said to be twenty.) In
addition she had an ordinary tomcat who would very often come home
from his nocturnal adventures in a sad state, so he was given the name
Thomas Becket (referring to the Archbishop of Canterbury who was
killed in office by order of King Henry II) not that this meant a
great deal to me then, nor was it very appropriate.
