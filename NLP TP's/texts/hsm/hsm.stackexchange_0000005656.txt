Q:

Who invented the divisibility symbol and why is it backwards?

When we want to perform division, we write e.g. $8/2$ (this is what we already learn at school). But when we want to express that $2$ is a divisor of $8$, we write: $2\mid 8$. What the heck?? I do find this very counterintuitive, I would have expected $8\mid 2$ instead. 
So, is there a good reason to write $2\mid 8$ instead of $8\mid 2$, and who invented that notation? 

A:

In mathematics, we often write relations between $a$ and $b$ in the form $aRb$. I mean this both in the sense that we write that string to represent an abstract relation, as well as using that form to write expressions with particular relations. In almost every case, these are read as "$a$ [relation] $b$." For a few examples, we have

$a:=b$, "is defined to be"
$a\geq b$, "is greater than or equal to"
$a\in b$, "in / is an element of"
$a\subseteq$ "is a subset of"
$a\to b$, "maps to / is mapped to"
$a=O(b)$, "is big-O of"

Notably, every relation on this list is antisymmetric, so the ordering of $a$ first and then $b$ is important. This list is extremely incomplete, and there are dozens more. 
The correct reading of the symbol $|$ is "divides / is a divisor of." When interpreted in this way, $a|b$ aka "$a$ divides $b$" fits this very well established pattern perfectly. Although it might be counter-intuitive to someone who has more experience with arithmetic than mathematics, it's actually a manifestation of a highly standardized pattern.

A:

Don E.  Knuth and some of his co-authors don't write 2 | 8 but 2 \ 8. If I understand correctly, their concerns regarding the a | b notation are not totally unrelated to those already mentioned by SearchSpace:
" The notation $m \mid n$ is actually much more common than $m \backslash n$ in current mathematics literature. But vertical lines
are overused--for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional
probabilities, etc.--and backward slashes are underused. Moreover,  $m\backslash n$ gives an impression that $m$ is the denominator of an
implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean
leftward".
