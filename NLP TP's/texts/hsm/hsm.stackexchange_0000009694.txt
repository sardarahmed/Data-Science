Q:

Which physicist is this quote attributed to?

There is a quote from a 19-20th century scientist that goes (and I am paraphrasing):

New scientific theories are never accepted until old scientist die. 

Who is this cynical quote attributed to, and what is the exact phrasing of the quote? 
Based on my memory of the quote I would put the following odds:

90% it was a physicist from the late 19 or early 20th century
70% it was Niels Bohr or Erwin Schrodinger — I did of course google for a list of known quotes but didn’t see the above one anywhere. 
20% it was in reference to quantum mechanics.
