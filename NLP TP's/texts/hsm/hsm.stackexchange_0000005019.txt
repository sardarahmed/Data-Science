Q:

When was brehmsstrahlung discovered?

I remember that not long ago wikipedia had somewhere info regarding the discovery of that phenomenon, but apparently all reference hasbeen removed.
Searching the web I found a serbian site claiming that  Tesla discovered it in 1892, and published his finding in 1897. Tha is confirmend by Miles Mathis, but apparently he is not a reliable source.
Do you have any precise and reliable details on the issue?

A:

Seems around 1896 by Tesla from here http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/rg.284075206
