Q:

Why does Newton claim : "Plato is my friend — Aristotle is my friend — but my greatest friend is truth."?

Basically, why did Newton write : "Plato is my friend — Aristotle is my friend — but my greatest friend is truth." ? What were the influences of these two on him ? 

A:

Newton (I assume the attribution is correct) was merely paraphrasing a well-known Latin phrase traditionally ascribed to Plato (though not found in any of Plato's authentic works). Roger Bacon quoted it as: Nam Plato dicit: "Amicus est Socrates, magister meus, sed magis est amica veritas", and Bacon's contemporary Thomas Aquinas cites it in a similar form.

A:

It may be perhaps worth to mention that the quote is strongly reminiscent of a passage in Aristotle as well. In the Nicomachean Ethics (Bekker numbering 1096a), we read (transl. Roger Crisp):

ἀμφοῖν γὰρ ὄντοιν φίλοιν ὅσιον προτιμᾶν τὴν ἀλήθειαν.
For one might love both, but it is nevertheless
a sacred duty to prefer the truth to one's friends.

Since a similar quote is ascribed to Plato, this may explain why Newton sees fit to reference both philosophers in his own version.
