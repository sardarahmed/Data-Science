Q:

Remarkable numerical calculations before electronic computers

I know the story that Cole found the factoring of the big number $2^{67}-1$. 
Is there any other remarkable achievement of hand calculation? 

A:

Another example of a "remarkable achievement of hand calculation" was in the field of mathematical astronomy. 
During 1758, Alexis Clairaut and his collaborators in Paris worked to refine Edmond Halley's prediction (published in 1705) of a return in about 1758 of the comet that now carries Halley's name.  Halley's original prediction had been for 1758, based on his assessment that the comet of 1682 was periodic, with a mean orbital period of about 75.5 years.  (Halley later somewhat modified the prediction by an informed guess that a close encounter with Jupiter could delay the event by a few months, perhaps to early 1759.)  
Clairaut's calculations refined the prediction, forecasting a return with perihelion passage in mid-April 1759 -- give or take a month. Observations of the comet then showed that indeed it was a return of a comet with closely similar orbital elements as the 1682 comet, verifying the return prediction, and showing that it passed perihelion on 13 March, just within the margin of error that Clairaut had allowed. 
The calculation was remarkable both for what was done and for the public reaction to which it contributed.
Clairaut, assisted by Jerome Lalande and Mme Lepaute, had calculated by hand a numerical integration of the perturbing effects of Jupiter and Saturn. Lalande wrote that for six months Clairaut and his collaborators in Paris calculated from morning to night, sometimes even continuing at the table at mealtimes. They verified that the perturbing effects acted to delay the return of the comet by some months relative to the original date-estimate of 1758. 
Much of the public attention was on the event itself, but the calculations also drew attention and increased Clairaut's fame (not without controversy, spurred partly by rivalries as well as by scientifically-based objections).

I've always liked logarithms because of their properties, and for some time I wondered who got the idea in the first place and how were the tables computed. It turns out logarithms were developed and computed simultaneously and independently by John Napier and Joost Bürgi. Both of them calculated huge logarithm tables by hand:

Napier computed almost ten million entries from which he selected the appropriate values. Napier himself reckoned that computing this many entries had taken him twenty years, which would put the beginning of his endeavors as far back as 1594.

Bürgi computed logarithms for 100000000 to 1000000000. This filled fifty-eight pages of tables for a total of 23,030 entries (23,027, plus an additional 3 entries) to be computed to eight significant digits.

What about Archimedes computing $\pi$ with such a precision that he was able to prove that$$3+\frac{10}{71}<\pi<3+\frac17?$$Or the ancient Babylonians being able to compute$$\sqrt2\simeq1+\frac{24}{60}+\frac{51}{60^2}+\frac{10}{60^3}?$$
