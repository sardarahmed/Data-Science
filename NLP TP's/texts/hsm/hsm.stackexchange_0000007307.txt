Q:

When did set theory throw off theology?

"The general set theory [...] definitely belongs to metaphysics. You can easily convince yourself when examining the categories of cardinal numbers and the order type, these basic notions of set theory, on the degree of their generality. 
    [...] and the fact that my presently written work is issued in mathematical journals does not modify the metaphysical contents and character of this work. 
    [...] By me Christian philosophy is for the first time confronted with the true teachings of the infinite in its beginnings." [G. Cantor, letter to T. Esser (15 Feb 1896)] 
"I have to draw your attention to two facts: 1st to the untearable ties that connect metaphysics and theology, in that the latter is the lodestar according to which the former is adjusting itself. [...] There follows a threefold: a) In metaphysical discussions it is sometimes inevitable to have theology join in. b) Every real progress in metaphysics strengthens or multiplies the tools of theology; it may even happen that human reason (of course subjugating to the infallible decisions of the church) may obtain deeper and richer symbolic insights with respect to the mysteries of the religion than has been expected or foreseen." [G. Cantor, letter to T. Esser (15 Feb 1896)]
"[...] it is clear that the theological considerations by which Cantor motivated his notion of the actual infinite, were metaphysical in nature." [A. Heyting: "Technique versus metaphysic in the calculus", in Imre Lakatos (ed.): "Problems in the philosophy of mathematics", North Holland, Amsterdam (1967) p. 43]
"Cantor is probably the last exponent of the Newtonian attitude with respect to religion." [H. Meschkowski, W. Nilson: "Georg Cantor Briefe", Springer, Berlin (1991) p. 15]
"[...] it was a certain satisfaction for me, how strange this may appear to you, to find in Exodus chapt. XV, verse 18 at least something reminiscent of transfinite numbers, namely the text: 'The Lord rules in infinity (eternity) and beyond.' I think this 'and beyond' hints to the fact that $\omega$ is not the end but that something is existing beyond." [G. Cantor, letter to R. Lipschitz (19 Nov 1883)]
"Compare the concurring perception of the whole sequence of numbers as an actually infinite quantum by St Augustin (De civitate Dei. lib. XII, chapt. 19) [...] While now St Augustin claims the total, intuitive perception of the set ($\nu$), 'quodam ineffabili modo', a parte Dei, he simultaneously acknowledges this set formally as an actual infinite entity, as a transfinitum, and we are forced to follow him in this matter." [G. Cantor, letter to A. Eulenburg (28 Feb 1886)]
So according to Cantor, the inventor of set theory, set theory $S$ by the following syllogism, is part of theology $T$:
$S\subseteq M \wedge M\subseteq T \Rightarrow S \subseteq T $
It appears as if today set theorists do not like to remember the roots. But have they ever been cut, and if so when and where?

A:

It was never really connected. Cantor's mathematical papers contain nothing of the sort you cite. That Cantor himself was interested in theology is no more relevant than Newton's interest in the same. But you do not ask "when Mechanics threw of theology?" They were never related. But one person can write on several different subjects.

A:

Cantor's metaphysical views are probably largely irrelevant compared to his lasting contribution to set-theoretic foundations commonly used today.  Nevertheless there may be an interesting issue here having to do with mathematical modernity.  Many historians today associate mathematical modernity with Cantorian set theory and Hilbert's formalism.  On this view, Cantor is one of the early moderns.  There is of course a tension here between Cantor's metaphysical views, on the one hand, and an attempt to portray him as a modern.  Attitudes of this sort among historians become particularly problematic when they are combined with attempts to portray other mathematicians as countermodern and notably Felix Klein.  Our assessment of the work of such historians, including Herbert Mehrtens and Jeremy Gray, is due to appear in 2017 in Mat.Stud. and is available on the arxiv.
