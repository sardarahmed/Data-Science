Q:

History of cohomology theory

I saw this post.  And I already posted it on Math stack exchange, but since someone recommended this site, I'm refining it and posting it again.  And I understand that the mathematical object called cohomology came from Poincaré duality.  But I would like to know the details of the history of cohomology itself.  So, if you know, I would appreciate it if you could leave an answer.  Or, I would appreciate it if you could recommend a book related to the history of cohomology with as few formulas as possible.

A:

Cohomology theories were introduced independently by
A. Kolmogorov, Ueber die Dualitat im Aufbau der kombinatorischen Topologie, Mat. Sbornik, vol. 1, 1936, 97-102,
and by J. W. Alexander, On the chains of a complex and their
duals, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, 21, 1935, 509-512, complete exposition in A.. of Math., 37, 1936, 698-708.
Remark. One of the comments mentions Poincare duality. It is only modern formulation of duality that uses cohomology. Poincare himself stated it in terms of homology.

A History of Algebraic and Differential Topology, 1900 - 1960 by Jean Dieudonné describes, among other things, the development of (co)homology in great detail.
