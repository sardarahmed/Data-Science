Q:

Who decided on the convention for ordinal multiplication?

Ordinal multiplication has always seemed backwards to me. $\alpha \times \beta$ is defined as the concatenation of $\beta$ copies of $\alpha$, not the other way 'round as one might expect.
Does this go back to Cantor? Or did someone else create this convention?

A:

Cantor at first defined multiplication of ordinals one way, then later (for what he thought were good reasons) switched to the opposite way.  So YES it is due to Cantor.
