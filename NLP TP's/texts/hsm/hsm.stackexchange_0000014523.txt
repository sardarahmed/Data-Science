Q:

Why is thermodynamics called thermodynamics?

Thermodynamics is derived from two Greek words

Therme, which means heat
Dynamis, which means power

We know that 'thermodynamics' encapsulates many concepts like energy, temperature, entropy, exergy, heat, work, etc., then why give heat  (therme) and Power (dynamis) such a special place?

A:

Thermodynamics is indeed derived from the Greek words Therme (heat) and Dynamis (power). However, Dynamis is not the same as the Physics definition of Power but is synonymous with "might" or "strength".
The term "Thermodynamics" originates from the concept of "motive power of heat", which first appeared in 1849 in William Thomson's (Lord Kelvin) paper "An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat â€“ with Numerical Results Deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam." The term is claimed to have been coined by James Joule in 1858 in reference to Thomson's paper.
Thus, Thermodynamics (or "thermo-dynamics" as written earlier) was associated with heat's motive power, that is, the "might" of heat to do work or cause motion.
