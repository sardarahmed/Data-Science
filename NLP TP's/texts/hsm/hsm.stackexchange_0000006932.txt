Q:

Was Babylonian Mathematics as sophisticated as Greek mathematics?

Why its true that the Egyptians did not see much developments. It has been said that the Babylonians were equal to the Greeks in mathematical achievement in terms of having an axiomatic, deductive system.
Would you agree with that claim? If not, why is there scholarly debate about, or more precisely what is the scholarly debate about in terms of this subject.

A:

The short answer is certainly no. Mathematics as it is practiced today has its own unique method of telling what is true and what is not. This method is called "mathematical proof". This is what distinguishes mathematics from all other activities. No other culture practiced any form of mathematical proof before Greeks. Moreover, there is absolutely no indication that  that any culture invented it independently before or after. In this precise sense the Greeks invented mathematics.
Of course one can use a broader definition of mathematics, to include all activities related to counting and measuring something. Then every culture had some form of this of course. But even with this broad definition no other culture stands any comparison with the Greeks in its contribution to mathematics that we practice and study today.
