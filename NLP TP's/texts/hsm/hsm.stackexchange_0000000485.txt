Q:

Who invented the concepts of potential and kinetic energy?

Who invented potential and kinetic energy ?
Was it Newton ?
Or someone else ?
I have the impression Newton used those ideas but they already existed.

A:

In a way, it goes back to Aristotle and his dual concepts of actuality and potentiality. My quick description of them is as follows:

Potentiality: Potentiality, or dunamis, is the stored ability an object has to do something or be something.
Actuality: Actuality, or entelecheia/energeia, is what an object is doing or is at a point in time.

Now, these had broader definitions than the ones we use to day for potential and kinetic energy. For example, according to Aristotle, the potentiality of an object included all the forms it could take (e.g. clay could become a sculpture).
These are clearly not the same things as today's notions of kinetic and potential energy, but they were the precursors to our modern ideas.
