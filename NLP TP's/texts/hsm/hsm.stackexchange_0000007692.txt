Q:

Origin of Compactness

According to Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Urysohn, Urysohn and Alexandrov first formulated the modern definition of compactness. In which paper did they do this? Is there an English translation? If so, where can I find it?

A:

See Wiki's entry on Compact space :

Alexandrov, Pavel and Urysohn, Pavel (1929), "MÃ©moire sur les espaces topologiques compacts", Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam, Proceedings of the section of mathematical sciences, 14.
