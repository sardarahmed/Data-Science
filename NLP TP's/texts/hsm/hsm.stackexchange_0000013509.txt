Q:

What is the origin of the parsec?

In astronomy the parsec is a unit of length:
A parsec (abbreviated pc) is a unit of distance used by astronomers, cosmologists, and astrophysicists.
1 parsec is equal to $3.08567758\times10^{16}$ meters, or $3.26163344$ light years
I think this is a rather arbitrary number. Somewhat like a (land)mile being about $1.5\dots$ kilometers.
What is the ratio behind this number?

A:

This word was coined by H. H. Turner.
par- (in parallax n.) + sec- (in second)

A unit of length equal to the distance at which a star would have a
heliocentric parallax of one second of arc, approximately equivalent
to 3·086 × 10^13 kilometres (19·2 × 1012 miles, 3·26 light years).
1913   F. W. Dyson in Monthly Notices Royal Astron. Soc. 73 342
There is need for a name for this unit of distance... Professor [H.
H.] Turner suggests Parsec, which may be taken as an abbreviated form
of ‘a distance corresponding to a parallax of one second’.
