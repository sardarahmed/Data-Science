Q:

Could someone have discovered the moons of Jupiter before Galileo?

As Hans Lipperperhey had made a decent telescope albeit worse telescope before Galileo, source, would he have been able to theoretically view the moons of Jupiter before Galileo if he had looked?

A:

Given that it's reasonably easy to see the 4 major moons with a 6 to 8- power binoculars, (you can find hundreds of discussions of planet-gazing with binocs online) it is quite reasonable to suppose that a patient, skilled observer with a 3 or 4 X telescope could have observed these moons.  
Keep in mind that Lipperperhey, or users of his 'scope, would have had not only to see the moons, but make enough observations to recognize that they are orbiting Jupiter rather than being other (perhaps even stellar) sky objects.
