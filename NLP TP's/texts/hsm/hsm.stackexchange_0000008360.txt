Q:

Looking for references to an experiment on the evaporation rate of water in sunlight

I remember reading a long time ago about some experiments measuring evaporation rate of water in large open containers (tubs) sitting on open ground. It was a simple experiment, each day the water level would be checked and recorded. From what I remember the experiment was in the 1950's or 1960's in Israel.
Results generally made sense, the rate of loss was highest on hot sunny days, but something about the analysis lead to the conclusion that in addition to thermal effects (hot water evaporates faster than cold water) there was also a component to the evaporation rate related to the brightness of the light itself; a non-thermal or light-induced evaporation process.
I've been searching and so far come up empty-handed. I've even asked a related question in Physics SE (Rate of direct (non-thermal) photon-induced evaporation of water?
) several months ago, but so far no bites.
I can't remember where I read this, but it may have been as an anecdote in a text about either climate change or long term variability of the solar constant or the power output of the Sun.

A:

Israel in the 60's: these experiments were probably from Gerald Stanhill (one of the discovers of global dimming). The "tubs" were probably class A evaporation pans (a fancy name for tubs!). Some of his publications on this topic include:

The control of field irrigation practice from measurements of evaporation (1962)
The use of Class A evaporation pan data to estimate the irrigation water requirements of the cotton crop (1963)
A field test of the control of cotton irrigation practice from Class A pan data (1964)

But all three were published in the Israel journal of agricultural research and seem very hard to find online... You might have to try to get a paper copy from a science library, or maybe send him a request via ResearchGate.
