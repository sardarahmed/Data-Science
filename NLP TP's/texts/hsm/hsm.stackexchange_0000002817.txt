Q:

History of optics

In the English Language section, this question was asked. I posted the beginnings of an answer, and invited others to comment so that I could edit my answer and improve it.
I'd like to know about the history of optics, and the field of optics.  My questions:

If someone today says they are in the field of optics, I would think that they work with lenses, light, lasers, etc. I would not think that they work with the human eye and the visual system. Is this true?
At one time, it seems that the field of optics did include interest in how humans see. At what point did this interest in the eye start shifting to medicine and away from physics?
Many sources say the ancients were interested in optical illusions.  I cannot find what these were. What were they?

A:

This is right. Optics is a part of physics, not biology not medicine. But the person who prescribes eyeglasses is called an optometrist which has the same root.
It still includes. This part is called optics of the eye. It studies the eye optical system. Like there is an instrumental optics, and many other parts.
There are also optical studies of other (non-human) eyes in biology.
Why most of our scientific terminology uses Greek and Latin? Because science was invented by the Greeks. All our civilization comes from Greek and Roman civilization. During a very long period, until 17s century, Latin was the
universal language of science and education in Europe. They did not study English of French or Polish in schools and universities. They studied Latin. But Latin itself used Greek science terms. Because science was invented in Greek.
Nowadays scientists and engineers do not study Latin or Greek, so they invent terms mixing Latin and Greek roots.
