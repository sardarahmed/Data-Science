Q:

Are there historical origins of "robotic" voices seen in earlier sci fi movies?

While today text to speech technology gets so advanced that synthetic voices come quite close to human ones, during my childhood I got quite inspired by "robotic" mechanical voices in Hollywood sci fi movies of that time.
Now, my question is - was there an original TTS (text to speech) technology which gave input to those movies, or not?

A:

The technology is that of the "Voder" and "Vocoder" exhibited at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City.  See the Wikipedia articles on the vocoder  and the voder for some explanations and references to Sci Fi movies using it, and to this 1939 film clip.  There is a recent pop technology history book How to Wreck a Nice Beach on the subject.  The first non phone company and non military users of the technology seem to have been musicians.  It lives on in all cell phones and VOIP phones nowadays.
