Q:

Is Newton's Gravitational Constant G a force?

The Constant of Gravitation $G$ was first defined by Boys in 1894:

Employing the C.G.S system of measurement, the Newtonian Constant is equal to the force of attraction in dynes between two balls weighing a gramme each, with their centers one centimeter apart.

[...] as soon as all the quantities but G in Newtonâ€™s equation

$$
\text{Force}=G \frac{\text{Mass} \times \text{Mass}}{\text{Distance}^2}
$$

are known, no matter in what units the quantities are measured, G is known.

Boys says that, $G$ equals the force of attraction but when I look at the equation, I see that there is a force term, the force of attraction must be given by $F$ not by $G$.
If $G$ were equal to the force of attraction between unit Masses $M = M = 1$ gr, in unit distance $D=1$ cm, then for $2D=2$ cm, the force of attraction will be $2G$ which I believe is not correct.
What am I missing?

A:

$G$ can't be a force for a number of reasons:

It doesn't have the unit of a force.
It's a plain number, while a force is a vector.
It's constant, while a force can vary.

The way I understand the original text is that, in a very specific set of units, for very specific values of the parameters, the norm of the gravitational force happens to have the same numerical value as $G$.
But since both quantities don't have the same dimension, this equality is nothing more than a coincidence, one that will disappear as soon as you switch to other units.
There's one other example of this that I know of. When studying chemical equilibrium, the activity of a substance is a dimensionless number. For a compound in a solution, it's defined as:
$$a=\frac{C}{C^0}$$
$C$ being the concentration of the compound and $C^0=1~\text{mol/L}$ the standard concentration.
As the customary unit for concentration is mol/L, the activity happens to have the same numerical value as the concentration, although their respective units differ. But you cannot say that $a$ "is a concentration", because if you use other units, like mol/m$^3$ or mmol/L, it stops being true.
