Q:

Any notable large proof that took a long time before anyone checked it?

Have there been any examples in the past where a large proof is claimed but nobody takes the time to check and that has been proved/disproved after a long time? I am not interested in proofs that were never taken seriously because they were unreadable (not even wrong).

A:

Maybe classification of finite simple groups qualifies ("The proof consists of tens of thousands of pages in several hundred journal articles written by about 100 authors, published mostly between 1955 and 2004.")?

1983  Gorenstein announces the proof of the classification is complete,
somewhat prematurely as the proof of the quasithin case was
incomplete.
2004  Aschbacher and Smith publish their work on quasithin groups
(which are mostly groups of Lie type of rank at most 2 over fields of
even characteristic), filling the last gap in the classification known
at that time.
