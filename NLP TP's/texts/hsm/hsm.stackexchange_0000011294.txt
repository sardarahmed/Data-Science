Q:

Gauss on philosophers

Carl Friedrich Gauss said:

When a philosopher says something that is true then it is trivial. When he says something that is not trivial then it is false.

On one occasion I read that supposedly Gauss has added in parentheses that Aristotle was an exception. Do you know more about it?
If any, I'd be sure that Gauss rather said that "especially Aristotle", i.e. that "Aristotle was exceptionally bad".
Thus,
QUESTION Â  what Gauss really said?

A:

The quote is not accurate but Gauss actually wrote something similar to Schumacher in the letter of 1 November 1844 cited here, where he complains about concepts and definitions given in math books by philosopher that are not mathematicians, namely

[...] look around at modern philosophers [...] don't their definitions make your hair stand on end? Read in the history of ancient philosophy what the men of the days, Plato and others (I except Aristotle), gave as explanation.
  And even in Kant matters are often not much better; his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions seems to me either a triviality or false. 

So Gauss considers Aristotle to be the exception between ancient (and modern) philosophers in the sense that his definitions are free of confusion.
