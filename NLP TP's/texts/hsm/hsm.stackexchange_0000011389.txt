Q:

Plagiarism at the turn of 20th century

Have there have been any interesting cases of one person stealing another mathematician's results and publishing them as his own?  In particular, are there any interesting cases of this happening in the late 1800s or early 1900s?

A:

Date: 1930's.
There is the story of the "ergodic theorem". Young mathematician John von Neumann proved the so-called "mean ergodic theorem".  He wrote it up and sent it to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  It was reviewed by one of the editors of the Proceedings, senior mathematician G. D. Birkhoff.  In due course, Birkhoff recommended publication.  It appeared in 1932.  Meanwhile, inspired by von Neumann's result, Birkhoff worked furiously for a few months and obtained an improved result, the so-called "pointwise ergodic theorem".  He had it published in the same journal.  It appeared in 1931.  Birkhoff's paper made no mention of von Neumann's paper.  Only many years later, in a paper with Birkhoff as co-author, was it admitted that von Neumann had the priority.
