In 1746, d’Alembert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation
Who discovered the basic 1D wave equation?

A:

On the traditional account, it was D’Alembert. Taylor did investigate the vibrating string earlier (c.1713), but he treated it as a collection of individually vibrating points and did not write down the PDE. He did not even use derivatives and gave geometric arguments instead, but he did guess the shape of the fundamental mode correctly "by means of physical insight". Struik wrote even more charitably:"This means that for small vibrations Taylor has in principle
[the wave equation, although] there is no evidence that he had any notion of partial derivatives". Perhaps, Robinson, quoted in the OP, shared the sentiment.
Here is from Cannon's chapter on Taylor:

"Brook Taylor presented his work on the vibrating string to the Royal
Society in September of 1712. His paper appeared in 1714 in the volume
of the Philosophical Transactions for 1713; 1 and a revised version was
included in his book on the calculus/ published in 1715. This work introduces
the pendulum condition. All elements of the string are supposed to
undergo small vibrations as simple pendulums all of the same period; hence
they are restored by harmonic forces of the same intensity... He sees each element
$\rho\ ds$ as a simple particle oscillating in one dimension with the same period
$T$ no matter which the element and what the amplitude of the oscillation.
Now, presumably thinking of this from the perspective of dynamics in a
single degree of freedom, Taylor concludes that each element $\rho\ ds$ moves
as a simple pendulum... Taylor doesn't use differential notation... Taylor doesn't introduce a notation for the mass density $\rho$;
geometrically Taylor's $pP$ is $ds$ and physically it is $\rho\ ds$."

D’Alembert did build on Taylor's work, and he first used partial derivatives and wrote down the equation, see Garber, Vibrating Strings and Eighteenth-Century Mechanics:

"D'Alembert was not the first mathematician to focus on establishing mathematically,
then solving, the equation of motion for a string under tension. In
examining the problem, d'Alembert exploited the newly developed partial differential
equations... What d' Alembert proposed to demonstrate for a string under tension,
using Taylor's conditions, was that "there are infinitely many curves other than
the companion of the elongated cycloid [sine curve] that satisfy the problem in
question". Starting from Brooke Taylor's work, d'Alembert focussed on Taylor's
expression for the accelerating force on an element of the string..."
