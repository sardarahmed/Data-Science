Q:

Did Jacques Tits have a middle name?

Every single web reference I have seen for Jacques Tits gives no indication that he had a middle name. All except one, which suggests his initials may have been J.L..
If this is so, what was his middle name? I have not been able to discover this.

A:

Technically, Belgians (and French) do not have middle names, but they can have first names consisting of two words, or several "first names as written on legal documents" (voornamen zoals op identificatie documenten) that are used nowhere else, apparently. Jacques' other first name, Léon, happens to be his father's first name. Here is from Buekenhout's Biography of Jacques Tits written on the occasion of him receiving the Abel prize:

"Jacques Léon Tits was born on August 12, 1930, in Uccle (Ukkel in Dutch) in Belgium, a southern township of Brussels. All of his publications, except one, are signed Jacques Tits and this is how I [Francis Buekenhout] will refer to him from now... Jacques’s father Léon Tits (1880–1943) was a mathematician and received his education from the Université Catholique de Louvain. His mother, Maria Louisa André (1889–1957) was a piano teacher. She used to be called Louisa, and I will do so hereafter."
