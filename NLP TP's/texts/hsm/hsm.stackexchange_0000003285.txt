Q:

Who discovered paramagnetism first?

Ferromagnetism is experienced by everyone.
But paramagnetism is not easy to perceive. 
So, who discovered paramagnetism first? The question is actually, who distinguished paramagnetism with ferromagnetism? 

A:

It appears that Faraday discovered it and that W. Whewell coined the term.
"paramagnetism, n.". OED Online. December 2015. Oxford University Press. (accessed January 24, 2016).:

W. Whewell Let. c 10 Dec. in M. Faraday Corr. (1996) III. 442,   I think you may keep diamagnetic for this class, and give to the opposite class a name implying that they rank along with magnetic bodies. I propose paramagnetic... Then this new branch of science, for so, of course, it will soon become, will be Paramagnetism.
