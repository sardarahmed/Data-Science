Q:

Why were the first steam engines “atmospheric engines”

Anybody who has boiled water knows that a positive pressure builds up when steam is produced. Indeed the first conceptual design of a steam engine (the Aeolipile) was a "positive pressure" engine. The fact that condensing steam produces a vacuum, however, is much less intuitive. Why, then, were the first industrial steam engines (Newcomen engines) atmospheric engines that produced work as the result of the vacuum created by condensing steam? Why did they not use the more "obvious" solution of steam pushing a piston? Were it technical concerns (high pressure leading to boiler explosions)?

A:

The best answer to that question is the following book:
The steam engine of Thomas Newcomen
by L. T. C. Rolt, J. S. Allen
1977
Moorland Pub. Co. ; New York : Science History Publications, 
To summarize what I learned from this book.

The boilers did not generate enough steam pressure to move pistons.  You needed to use the weight of the atmosphere for the power stroke.
Even if the boiler could generate high steam pressures, the art of machining pistons and cylinders was still in its infancy
