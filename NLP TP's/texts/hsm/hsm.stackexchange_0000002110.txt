Q:

Why is the notation $\sin^{-1} x$ so common?

$\sin^{-1} x$ means the inverse of $\sin x$ (it is also often called $\arcsin x$), but it can fairly easily be confused with $\sin(x)^{-1}$. Why is it used, when $\arcsin x$ is easier to type and is not easily confused with other things?

Here's some detail.
From Herschel's 'On a Remarkable Application of Cotes's Theorem', Philosophical Transactions, 1813:

Gauss wrote a review of this article in the GÃ¶ttingsche Gelehrte Anzeigen (reprinted in Werke, vol. 4, p. 361):

I will translate the last sentence:

What the author says about the notation $\cos^2 A$, which some newer mathematical writers use for the square of $\cos A$, totally against all analogy, as accordingly this should mean the cosine of an angle $= \cos A$, has our total approbation.

If you want someone to blame blame John Herschel, son of the famous astronomer William Herschel. The father in 1781 gave us the planet Uranus, the son in 1813 gave us the dubious symbol $\sin^{-1}(x)$ for the inverse sine. As precedent, he cited the 'operator powers' notation, like ${d^n}f$ from calculus, so according to Herschel we should write $d^{-1}f$ for $\int f$. "The symmetry of this notation, and above all the new and most extensive views it opens seem to authorize its universal adoption", he wrote. Herschel was aware of the potential confusion with arithmetical reciprocals, but apparently thought that the benefits outweighed the downsides.
First notation for the inverse sine was proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1729, it was $AS$, Euler shortened it to $A$ alone. Lagrange was first to introduce $\operatorname{arc}.\!\sin$, and with the dot eventually removed it became the standard in the continental Europe. And US and Britain would have followed suit too... if it wasn't for Herschel Jr.! When he published Traite de la Luminere in French in 1829 he himself used Lagrange's $arc.sin$. Perhaps it was a leftover of the Newton-Leibniz priority dispute and/or cultural rivalry between Britain and the continent, but British often insisted on being notationally different, feet and pounds are another example, as are the long division symbol, $\tan$ vs $\text{tg}$ for tangent, and $\sinh$ vs $\text{sh}$ for hyperbolic sine.

Florian Cajori has it in A History of Mathematical Notations Vol. II Paragraph 533 that "John Herschel's notation for inverse functions $\sin^{-1}x$,... etc., was published by him in the Philosophical Transactions of London, for the year 1813." Cajori goes on to indicate that Hershel gave specific instructions to not confuse the notation with the multiplicative inverse.
His justification for the notation, revolves around a "symmetry" with other notations like, for example, writing $\Delta\Delta\Delta x$ as $\Delta^3x$, and he lists several others. I refer you to the literature for the full description.
Now in the same, Cajori notes that "Some years later, Hershel explained that in 1813 he used ...[these notations]... as he then supposed for the first time. The work of a German analyst, Burmann, has however, within these few months come to his knowledge, in which the same is explained at a considerably earlier date."
There is much more detail in this reference, in particular explaining the logic of the notation.
