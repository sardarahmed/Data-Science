Q:

Is this Einstein rejection letter fake?

So I found this on the internet the other day-

Is this fake?
  Are there any ways to prove that it's fake?

Does there, if any, exist any real copy of such a rejection letter?(Was Einstein ever really rejected?)
I thought that why should people use English and not German here. That's suspicious of the originality of this letter!

A:

According to this, it's a modern fabrication:

Although Einstein’s initial application for a doctorate at the University of Bern (he had previously been awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich in 1905) was indeed rejected as insufficient in 1907, and it was not until the following year that he completed a new dissertation that resulted in his being awarded a doctorate by the University of Bern and given a position as a lecturer at that school, this image depicts a modern creation and not an actual letter sent to Einstein in 1907.

This is the official link from The University of Bern itself which declares it as a fraud.

A:

Its far more obvious than all of your assumptions, the supposed author of the letter was dead for more than 25 years by 1907. Case closed
