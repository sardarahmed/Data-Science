Q:

Who was the first English author that incorporated Markov's Law of Large Numbers and its derivation?

There is a theorem due to Markov, called Markov's Law of Large Numbers which goes by:

The weak law of large numbers holds if for some $\delta > 0,$ all the mathematical expectations $\mathbb E\left(|X_i|^{1+\delta}\right);~ i = 1,2,\ldots$ exist and are bounded.

But I didn't find any proof. So, I started sieving down the sources. Seneta (cf.$\rm [I]$) mentions that but didn't provide any proof. It was pinpointed to Markov's Ischislenie Veroiatnostei $(1913)$ chapter $\rm III.$ Unfortunately, it was written in Russian (is there any English translation?) and I couldn't make anything of it. Also, I was wondering how he derived it without using measure theoretic language. Nevertheless, I checked some of my probability books like Rosenthal, Klenke but couldn't find any explicit result and its derivation. Feller though mentioned Markov in a footnote but again didn't provide any explicit elaboration.
So, that leaves me wondering: who was the first English author that incorporated the result with a proof in their treatise?

Numbers, Eugene Seneta, $2013, $ p. $27.$

A:

In 1937, Markov's student J. Uspensky published his  English-language  Introduction to Mathematical Probability, which has the result in question on p.191.  It seems hard to believe this is the first English publication, however.
It is not present in the 3rd (1979) edition of Cramer's Random Variables, and so it might not be in the 1st (1936) edition, but I don't have one at hand to check.
