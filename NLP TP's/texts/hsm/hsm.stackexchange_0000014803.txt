Q:

Topologies without the axiom that finite intersection of open sets is open

A topology is a pair of

a nonempty set $P$ of points, and
a set $Opens\subseteq 2^P$ of open sets that is closed under two closure conditions:

arbitrary (possibly infinite) unions and
finite (possibly empty) intersections.

So far, so standard.  Please now consider dropping closure condition 2 above (closure under finite intersections).
My question is: can anyone provide a reference or references for any early discussion of the notion of topological space without condition 2 above.  It was eventually included in the standard definition as we know, but does anyone know of references to any debate over whether to include it or not (much as there were discussions over, for example, the axioms of set theory).
Thanks in advance.

A:

There was no early discussion of topology without closure under finite intersections. The open set definition first given by Bourbaki (1940) includes this condition, and its predecessors in terms of neighborhoods (Hausdorff, 1914) and in terms of closures (Alexandrov-Hopf, 1935) include its equivalents, see History of various definitions of topology and references there.
There was long experimentation (from 1906 to 1940) with various approaches to defining topology (via accumulation points, neighborhoods, closures, open sets), and  discussions of whether to include various separation axioms (by Hausdorff in 1927 and Alexandrov-Hopf in 1935) or some notion of uniformity (by Weil in 1937), but dropping closure under finite intersections (or its equivalents) was not considered. The remaining condition would have been too weak for intended applications.
