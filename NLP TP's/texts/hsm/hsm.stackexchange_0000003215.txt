Q:

Sources of early modern atomic theory of matter?

Modern atomic theory of matter is often attributed to Dalton in 1803, with roots going all the way back to Democritus, but I was wondering about early modern antecedents of Dalton's theory, perhaps in the 18th or even early 19th century. Were the general outlines of the atomic theory of matter accepted already at the dawn of the scientific revolution, who were the physicists involved, what were the elements of Dalton's theory that were already generally accepted before he came on the scene, and what were the genuinely new aspects in Dalton's formulation?

A:

Regarding Early Modern Atomism and chemistry, some possible sources of information are :

for Atomism  :Robert Hugh Kargon, Atomism in England from Hariot to Newton (1970) and Antonio Clericuzio, Elements, Principles and Corpuscles: A Study of Atomism and Chemistry in the Seventeenth Century (2000)
for Pierre Gassendi : Lynn Sumida Joy, Gassendi the Atomist: Advocate of History in an Age of Science (1987) 

and, of course,

for Robert Boyle :  Steven Shapin &Simon Schaffer, Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life (2nd ed, 2011) and William R. Newman, Atoms and Alchemy: Chymistry & the Experimental Origins of the Scientific Revolution (2006).
