Q:

Why is periodic motion always represented as a sine function

Why was periodic motion started to be represented as a sine function at the beginning? Is it because it is perhaps the simplest periodic function? Is there certainly any reason behind this representation?

A:

Periodic functions can be also represented by cosine functions, linear combinations of sine and cosine, and more generally by linear combinations
of exponential functions $e^{int}$ which represents a circular motion with fixed angular speed.
Of course, they can be also represented differently, like for example zig-zag functions used in ancient Babylon. The main mathematical advantage of exponentials come from the fundamental fact that they are eigenfunctions of the shift operator:
$$e^{in(t+a)}=e^{ina}e^{int}.$$
This fundamental property implies all other useful properties.
The idea that "every (celestial) motion can be represented in terms of uniform circular motions" was promoted by Greek philosophers in 4th century BC, and it was implemented in practice by Ptolemy and later astronomers.
Added. In my earlier answer I said that Fourier was not influenced by astronomy. He was solving different problems, related to heat equation. But the prominent role of sine and cosine in his work is explained by the SAME fundamental reason: they are eigenfunctions of the shift operator. And this fundamental property explains their omnipresence in mathematical physics and other areas of mathematics.
