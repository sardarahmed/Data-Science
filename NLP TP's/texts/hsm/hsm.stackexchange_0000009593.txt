Q:

Where can I find sources for Gergonne's research on the fundamental relations among classes?

Alfred Tarski writes

The whole of the old traditional logic...can almost entirely be reduced to the theory of the fundamental relations among classes, that is, to a small fragment of the entire theory of classes. (page 39)

In a footnote he remarks that 

These relations were first investigated in an exhaustive manner by J. D. GERGONNE (1771-1859)

I'm aware that Gergonne started his own journal Annales de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées, but I don't know where in his journal (or elsewhere) he published his results on the fundamental relations among classes. I have found some of these Annales on Internet Archive.
Where can I find sources for Gergonne's published work on the fundamental relations among classes?
