Q:

What is the oldest open question solved in mathematics?

In mathematics, 1760 Plateau's problem were solved, but it was only in 1930 that general
solutions were found in the context of mappings (immersions) independently by Jesse Douglas and Tibor Rad√≥.
1760 - 1930 = 170 years.
What is the oldest open question solved in mathematics?

A:

The Delian problem (doubling the cube) and the angle trisection problem are probably the oldest ones, though their exact age is not known. (Same applies to all problems of constructions with ruler and compass). They were certainly around in 4 bc, and existing sources show that by that time they were already old. Since both problems were solved only in 19th century, we conclude that it took at least 22 centuries to solve them, probably longer. Of course there are also unsolved problems going back to the same times, like the problem about odd perfect numbers.
Some authors speculate that these problems are near the origin of mathematics, A. Seidenberg, The ritual origin of geometry".
