Q:

Has the standard of mathematical proofs changed over time?

Why I asked this question : https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90195m/f54.image
p 50-51, in course of Cauchy, a proof of the intermediate value theorem. Now, that's not a proof.
And I learned that Cauchy had made a lot of mistakes, so this is not a proof, of a change of standard between our era and that of Cauchy.
But the question stay : has the standard of mathematical proofs changed over time ?

A:

Yes and no. It is better to say that there were always several different standards. Most proofs of Euclides, Archimedes and Apollonius are on the level of modern standards, though gaps in those proofs can be found, and some were found in the ancients time. At the time where calculus was invented, many mathematicians understood that the proofs using new methods are not to the same standard of rigor as the proofs of Archimedes.
It took more than two centuries to clean all this and to establish calculus on the same degree of rigor as in the work of Archimedes.  Archimedes himself also used sometimes non-rigorous arguments, and he perfectly understood this, and said this explicitly. And this is what happens nowadays too. So at any time, there are several different standards of rigor.
