Q:

Pairs of Mathematicians

In Hilbert by Reid, it is noted that Hilbert and Minkowski were great friends and often worked together on problems, seminars, and lectures. This is a similar relationship to the partnership between Hardy and Littlewood. Are there similar examples of strong and lengthy collaborations in mathematics?

A:

This is quite common. Some examples of pairs of very strong researchers who published at least $15$ papers together:

Guillemin and Sternberg. 
Harvey and Lawson.  
Colding and Minicozzi
Ozsvath and Szabo
Green and Tao.
Schoen and Yau. 
Mrowka and Kronheimer
Atiyah and Bott. 
Atiyah and Singer.

There are of course many more examples, as this list mostly reflects my own interests.
