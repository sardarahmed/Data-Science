Q:

How the random numbers were generated which were used during world war 2(ww2)?

I know One-time-pad were used during ww2 and, I want to know how the random numbers were generated.

A:

US Patent 2406031, filed on 21 May 1942, issued on 20 Aug 1946, describes one such technology:  A hopper feeds a jumble of transparent and opaque beads past  a photocell array.  The beads are fed back into the hopper, and the data read from the photocells ends up on a punched tape.
I don't know if this particular invention was used in practice, but it seems likely to me that something along these lines was used to produce the one-time keying material (the bulk of which was for use with teleprinters) for US forces in the war.
