Q:

What are the earliest mentions of Prime Numbers?

Egyptians and Babylonians must have had some ideas about primes but what are the earliest mentions or comments? Where is the first list of primes?
After Burkert's work on Pythagoreanism an answer about 'unidentified pythagoreans' would not count much. 
Euclide's proof (about the infinity of primes IX.20) is a landmark in mathematics well known enough to make later writings historically unintersting.
More specifically did early Greek philosophers mention primes and are there possibly different words and/or confusions?

A:

For some references, see :

Thomas Heath, A History of Greek Mathematics. Vol I (1921), page 72 :

Prime or incomposite numbers and secondary or composite numbers are distinguished in a fragment by Speusippus based upon works of Philolaus . We are told [ Iamblichus, in Nicom.] that Thymaridas called a prime number rectilinear, the ground being that it can only be set out in one dimension (since the only measure of it, excluding the number itself, is $1$). 

A:

The first preserved list of primes is row (b) of the famous Ishango bone: 11, 13, 17, 19. See my answer to the question When were numbers first used for anything other than counting?
