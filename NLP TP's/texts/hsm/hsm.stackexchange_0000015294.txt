Q:

What's the name of P C Gilmore?

I have several times come across the name P C Gilmore, and even made use of a publication by her, or him, viz. "The consistency of partial set theory without extensionality", which was published in Tomas Jech (ed): Axiomatic Set Theory, Part 2, American  Mathematical Society, 1974, 147-153.
May someone reveal what the initials "P" and "C" stand for?

A:

Mathematics Genealogy Project, which I see  is a service of the NDSU Department of Mathematics, in association with the American Mathematical Society, suggests that his name is Paul Carl Gilmore:
