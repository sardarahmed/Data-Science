Q:

Looking for a Book Which Discusses the Rigor in Newton's Principia Mathematica

About an year ago, I had seen an article somewhere on the internet which discussed Newton's Principia Mathematica and the rigor (or lack thereof) of the arguments presented.
I have forgotten who the author was and am unable to find the article back.

Is there a published book in which similar work has been done?

I am trying to write a term paper in my History of Math course for which I think this could be a suitable topic.
I accidently created the same post with a different account and was unable to delete it.
