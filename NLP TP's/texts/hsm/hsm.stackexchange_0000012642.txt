Q:

How did physicists deal with the variance of electromagnetism before special relativity?

I am trying to write a paper on how Einstein's special relativity (SR) essentially saved electromagnetism for high school and am confused on how the following two problems were solved.

How did physicists explain the (theoretical) disappearance of the magnetic force on a moving charge by changing the frame of reference?
Special relativity saves this by essentially showing that changing frames changes the electric force too, as well as the magnetic, but I am unsure about how this was tackled before

Michelson & Morley disproved the existence of luminiferous ether in 1887, 18 years before SR. Was the world of physics in complete chaos for the next 18 years with the apparent breaking of electromagnetism, or was there a temporary solution?

A:

There certainly WERE formulae that correctly described parts of the electromagnetic
puzzle, including Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction of distance, and even
some medium-drag light delay experiments with transparent media instead
of the fictitious ether.
What special relativity did was to incorporate all the various 'it-works-like-this'
rules into a single coherent picture, including generating all magnetic forces
from the behaviors of charge; it cut the four Maxwell equations
for electricity and magnetism down to two equations, and a principle
of relativity...   while simultaneously predicting a variety of phenomena
regarding space and time.   It revolutionized both electricity, AND
mechanics, with one concept.
