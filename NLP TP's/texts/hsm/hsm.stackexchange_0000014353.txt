Q:

What data did Copernicus use to construct his heliocentric model?

I think Copernicus and his contemporaries were modeling based on some data.
What data was Copernicus using and who created it?

A:

There's a notable problem of shortage of historical evidence for the way in which Copernicus came to his theories.
His earliest work that described his heliocentric concept is known as the 'Commentariolus', and in it he "says next to nothing about how he arrived at his new theories" -- see N M Swerdlow's (1973) paper "The Derivation and First Draft of Copernicus's Planetary Theory: A Translation of the Commentariolus with Commentary". The 1973 paper is available from Jstor and is still a good source along with the 1984 book "Mathematical Astronomy in Copernicusâ€™s De Revolutionibus" by N M Swerdlow and O Neugebauer (publ. Springer).
