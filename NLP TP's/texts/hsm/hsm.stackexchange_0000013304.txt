Q:

When was the concept of “Power” defined?

I know the Watt, as a unit of measuring power was defined somewhere in early 1900's.
But who was the first physicist to consider "work over time"? Perhaps Newton?
Problem with searching something like this is that it keeps coming up with "Who invented electricity" - but I think power, as form of "energy conversion" or "work over time", surely existed before we were researching electricity!

A:

This source says the following about James Watt,

Watt is most famous for inventing an improved steam engine in the
years around 1770 and slightly less famous for inventing the concept
of power shortly thereafter.  Watt wouldn't have thought about power
they same way we do today. The concept of energy wasn't invented until
after he died. For him, power was the product of force and velocity.
P = Fv

That page references a book,
"The Edinburgh Review, Oct 1808"  containing a treatise by Olinthus Gregory on steam engines.
