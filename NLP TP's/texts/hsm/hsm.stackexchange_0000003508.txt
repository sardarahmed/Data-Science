Q:

How did Planck calculate the Planck constant?

Having started to learn about quantum behavior, this formula came up:
$$E = hf $$
Where $E$ is energy, $h$ is the Planck constant and $f$ is the frequency.
My physics teacher suggested an experiment involving LEDs as a way of calculating $h$.
However given that the Planck constant was calculated long before the invention of LEDs, how was it calculated? I know from doing some research Planck used something to do with black body radiation, but I cannot seem to find out the specifics of his method.

A:

See How did Planck derive the black body radiation formula without using the Bose statistics? for general circumstances of Planck's discovery. Specifically, Planck was trying to reproduce the expression for entropy of an ideal oscillator involved in the original derivation of the black body radiation law. To do so, he had to assume that energy is split into "droplets" and count the number of ways it could be distributed. The idea was to take continuous limit at the end. But that did not reproduce the expression Planck needed. 
As an "act of despair" ("no matter what the cost, I must bring about a positive result") he fixed the energy of his droplets in proportion to the frequency of light, and introduced the constant of proportionality as a "new constant of nature". To get the value he fit it to the expression he had for the oscillator entropy, which in turn was fit to the experimental radiation measurements of 1899, the ones that showed that Wien's law, which Planck derived earlier, was not followed at low frequencies.
