Q:

Was carbon dioxide also called carbonic acid historically?

I am reading the classic paper by Thomas Andrews, in which he discovered the critical point. 
The gas he used in his experiments is called by him 'carbonic acid'. By its critical temperature being 31.1 Celsius, I infer that it is actually 'carbon dioxide'. 
Do I get it right? 

A:

Yes.  The Oxford English Dictionary gives instances of the term "Carbonic acid" meaning CO${}_2$ as old as about 1800.  By 1900, the term "carbonic acid gas" was in common use for CO${}_2$ (my father called it that, 1950-2000, for instance).  More recently it turns out that there is a gaseous phase of H${}_2$CO${}_3$, so "carbonic acid gas" has become an ambiguous term.
