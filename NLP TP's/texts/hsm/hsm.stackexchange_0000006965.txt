Q:

Arithmetic mean - who, when?

We are sitting in class and I was wondering: who came up with the arithmetic mean? 
Who proposed it or who mentioned it first in his/her work? Google showed the oldest mentions in 1750-1800 but...
We looked at Wikipedia but didn't find the answer. 
Thank you for any lead, as even the teacher doesn't know.

A:

The source is ancient Greek mathematics: at least the Pythagorean Archytas.
The early extant souce seems to be Fragment 2 of the lost work of On Music [cited by Porphyry, On Ptolemy’s Harmonics, 1.5] :

And Archytas speaking about the means writes these things:

“There are three means in music: one is the arithmetic [αριθμητικά], the second geometric [γεωμετρικά] and the third sub-contrary [, which they call “harmonic”].
