Q:

How were the ions produced in Lawrence's 1932 cyclotron?

From what I understand Lawrence split the atom shortly after Cockcroft and Walton. The ions were 1.25Mev protons originating at the center of the cyclotron. A rather small circular device. I looked at the Schematics but does not show exactly how he did it.
Although a different question is this essentially what Glen Seaborg used to bombard Neptunium in order to produce plutonium?

A:

This is discussed in the original article in Physics Review in the Experimental Arrangement section (starting on page 25).

The source of ions. An ideal source of ions is one that delivers to the
diametral region between the electrodes large quantities of ions with low
components of velocity normal to the plane of the accelerators. This requirement
has most conveniently been met in the present experiments merely by
having a filament placed above the diametral region from which a stream of
electrons pass down along the magnetic lines of force, generating ions of
gases in the tube.

It is shown in Figures 1 and 2 in the paper. Basically a hot filament producing electrons to ionize the gas.
Your second question is answered in another Physical Review article. Uranyl nitrate in a paraffin block was placed behind a beryllium target irradiated with deuterons. The nuclear reaction between Be and D produced neutrons.
