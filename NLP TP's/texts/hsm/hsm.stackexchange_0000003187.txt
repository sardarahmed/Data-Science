Q:

Biographical articles on Newton and Galileo by physicist or historian

I am going to give a lecture to school children on the lives of Newton, Galileo and Einstein. I have enough literature on Einstein but not enough on the lives of Galileo and Newton. So I am looking for some articles written by prolific physicist or historian about the lives of Newton and Galileo. So can anyone suggest me some articles? Thanks folks in advance.

A:

I am not sure how much detail you are looking for. MacTutor has decent short biographies of both Galileo and Newton by O'Connor and Robertson. Einstein wrote a eulogy of Newton in 1927, which also mentions Galileo, but focuses on science rather than personal life. If you want something more detailed and personal there is recent Newton by Iliffe, who is the historian in charge of the NEWTON project. There is analogous book about Galileo by Drake. It is not by physicist or historian but I'll mention it anyway, Bertold Brecht has a famous play Life of Galileo, a literary adaptation highlighting his personal struggles.
