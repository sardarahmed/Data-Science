Q:

When did Europe start accurately predicting solar and lunar eclipses?

I would like to know when Europe obtained the ability to predict lunar and solar eclipses.
I remember reading about some story, where Columbus or someone like that used an eclipse chart to convince the native Indians that he was a god. This would imply that Europe had the ability somewhere around the year 1500, which seems pretty early to me. I would've thought It would have to wait until Keplers Laws at least.
However, I want to be more exact than that. When did they start reliably making predictions without any misses? It would be nice to know which European nation did this first, and how fast it spread around Europe and the world.
If some other region did this first, I would love to know about it too.

A:

It did not happen quite the way you imagined. The first accurate theories of solar and lunar motion in Europe are due to the father of astronomy Hipparchus (c. 190 â€“ 120 BC), over millenium and a half before Columbus. They were geocentric and did not require Kepler's laws or any laws of dynamics, only geometry. But Hipparchus got his data from Babylonians, who could make accurate predictions of eclipses for centuries before that without even kinematics. What it required was careful observations and discerning subtle periodic patterns in the movements of the Sun and the Moon. Later Maya managed to do the same independently by a similar approach, see How accurate are Mayan astronomical "ephemerides"?
