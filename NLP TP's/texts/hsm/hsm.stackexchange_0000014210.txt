Q:

Biographical details for Paul Wernicke

Paul Wernicke, the eponym of Wernicke's Theorem , discovered during his investigations into the Four Color Theorem.
I understand he was born somewhere in the German sphere of influence (i.e. could have been what is now Poland, for example), and sometime after that moved to the US.
There are also a few citations I have found concerning his 1904 paper in Mathematische Annalen (vol 58 no 3 pp 413-426), and some indication that he also published on the subject in 1897 -- but I can find very little else.  He is mentioned in Robin Wilson's 2002 "Four Colours Suffice", but he also includes nothing beyond the above information.
Is there a resource anywhere which provides any further information: dates of birth and death, locations of such, where he studied, what he did for a living, and so on?

A:

Ludwig August Paul Wernicke was born in Leipzig on January 9, 1866 1. His father appears to have been the Lutheran pastor August Wernicke, who became embassy chaplain in Lisbon in 1873 1. Prior to that he was pastor of the German Lutheran parish in Helsingfors (modern-day Helsinki) from 1870 to 1873 2. In Lisbon, the embassy chaplain also served as pastor of the German Protestant parish 3. Indications are that August Wernicke held this position until 1883 4.
Paul Wernicke was home schooled until he entered high school in 1882, boarding at the prestigious school in Pforta 1. This school for gifted students was established in a former monastery in 1543 by the rulers of Saxony. The vast majority of the students belonged to the Lutheran denomination. Wernicke graduated Easter 1885 1. After his compulsory one-year military service he studied mathematics and natural sciences at the University of Berlin 1. He moved to the US in 1892 and became a college professor 1 at Agricultural & Mechanical College in Lexington, Kentucky in 1894 5, teaching German and French 6. In 1898 Wernicke became a naturalized citizen of the United States 1.
He seems to have retained an interest in mathematics, presenting a paper on the map-coloring problem at the summer meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Toronto in 1897. As head of the department of modern languages of A. & M. College he took a 1½-year leave of absence 1 around 1903 7 to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics at the Georg August University in Göttingen. His thesis advisor there was Hermann Minkowski 8. His dissertation "Ueber die Analysis situs mehrdimensionaler Räume." (Analysis situs in higher dimensions) was published in 1904; the Ph.D. defense took place on August 1, 1904.
In 1906 Wernicke became an additional instructor in mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri 9. The following year he was upgraded to full instructor 10. Between 1908 and 1910 there are references to him as a professor of mathematics at the University of Kansas in Lawrence 11. Wernicke did some work as a translator 12, and in 1919 he was listed as a translator at the patent office in Washington, D.C. 13. From 1921 to 1924 he taught courses in mathematics at Research University in Washington, D.C. 14. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, he appears to have been active in the "Problems and Solutions" section of The American Mathematical Monthly. His last mention in this context is in 1932 15.
I have not been able to establish a date of death. I cannot find Paul Wernicke in what is available of the 1940 US census free of cost; you may want to check one of the commercial genealogical databases for that data.

"My connection with Research University, with regards to the standing of which you are inquiring, has been limited to teaching in their evening classes during the years 1921 to 1924. My classes were small ones in analytic geometry and calculus. They were put through regular collegiate examinations
and graded according to standards of recognized schools, e.g. the engineering department of Washington University, St. Louis, where I formerly taught. [..]"

This appears to have been a hearing regarding a bill against so-called "degree mills".
