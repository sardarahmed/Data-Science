Q:

Dirac’s debt to Hamilton

According to Tobias Hurter’s popular exposition Too Big for a Single Mind (narrated in the present tense):

Dirac makes use of an elegant mathematical tool developed by the Irish mathematician William Hamilton in the nineteenth century.

This is from a passage discussing Dirac in Cambridge in the summer of 1925; see pages 127-128.
What “elegant mathematical tool” is Hurter talking about? Was it quaternions? Unfortunately the notes at the back of the book do not say anything more about this episode.

A:

I'd wager that the ambiguous reference is to the appearance of Hamiltonian quaternions (as an instance of a Clifford algebra) in Dirac's construction of a square root (of a certain sort) of a/the Laplacian, which is nowadays called a/the "Dirac operator". (Not to be confused with Dirac's $\delta$.) It is a linear differential operator with coefficients in a Clifford algebra related to a quadratic form attached to the geometry of the situation.
This is quite different from square roots of positive unbounded self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces... For example, the Dirac operator still has a robust distributional sense, while the unbounded-op-on-Hilbert-space version is not distributional.
The Hamiltonian quaternions arise as a Clifford algebra attached to a low-dimensional quadratic form.
