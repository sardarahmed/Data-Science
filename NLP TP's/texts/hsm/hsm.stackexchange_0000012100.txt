Q:

How did the "Wheel of Theodorus" become known as the "Wheel of Einstein"?

I've desperately searched the Internet, to no avail, to find a citation of how the "Wheel of Theodorus" became known as the "Wheel of Einstein" as claimed by Wikipedia and Wolfram.

A:

Considering that "The Wheel of Theodorus is also called the Spiral of Theodorus,
the Square Root Spiral, Einstein Spiral, or Pythagorean Spiral," [W.Lombard] I doubt you'll find anything other than random common usage as a reason for naming.
( also  â€œWurzel Spirale" )
