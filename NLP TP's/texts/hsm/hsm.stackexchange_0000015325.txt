Q:

What is the etymology of the term space-time?

I'm looking for the earliest references to the word space-time (in the modern sense), in any language.
The first references would likely be in German, as Raum-Zeit or Raumzeit.
Of course, H. Minkowski is credited as the originator of the idea. I found the following references to Minkowski's work in Pauli's Theory of Relativity:

"Das Relativitätsprinzip", published twice (lecture 1907-11-05):

Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung (Jber. dtsch.
Mat. Ver.), 24 (1915) 372
Annalen der Physik (Ann. Phys., Lpz.), 47
(1915) 927

"Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Köpern", published twice:

Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen
(Nachr. Ges. Wiss. Göttingen) (1908) 53
Mathematische Annalen (Math. Ann.), 68 (1910) 472

Raum und Zeit, published twice (lecture 1908-09-21):

Physikalische Zeitschrift (Phys. Z.), 10 (1909) 104
Das Relativitätsprinzip (Leipzig 1913) - English translation here. Here he uses die Welt ('the world') instead of Raum-Zeit or Raumzeit (space-time).

I have only been able to find the text of number 3, in English translation.
Two questions:

Is there any online access to these old German publications?
Does anyone know of any early references to publications
containing the word Raum-Zeit or space-time in the text?

A:

The Math. Ann. paper is here.
Minkowski uses the term Raum-Zeit in this paper, not Welt.
Examples of terms used in the paper:

Raum-Zeit-Linien - lines
Raum-Zeit-Vektoren - vectors
Raum-Zeit-Matrix
Raum-Zeit-Sichel  - ??
Raum-Zeit-NullPunkte - origin event
Raum-Zeitpunkte - point (event)

The Ann. Phys. paper is here. I see no use made of the term Raum-Zeit in this paper.
In summary, the earliest paper that I've seen that makes repeated use of Raum-Zeit is this paper (1910):
Mathematische Annalen (Math. Ann.), 68 (1910) 472
which is apparently a reprint of an earlier paper (1908; thank you @Conifold for the link):
Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen (Nachr. Ges. Wiss. Göttingen) (1908) 5
Some results from Google Books Search for "raumzeit" from 1905-01-10 to 1915-12-31:
H. Minkowski, Raum und Zeit,
Physikalische Zeitschrift, Vol 10, No. 3, p107 (1909-02-01).
Raum-Zeit-NullPunkte is the only occurrence. This doesn't seem to appear in the English translation.
Gunnar Nordström, Zur Elektrodynamik Minkowskis,
Physikalische Zeitschrift, Vol 10, No. 20 (1909-10-15).
Raum-Zeit-Bezugssystemen (frame of reference) is the only occurrence.
A. Einstein,  Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung., Physikalische Zeitschrift, Vol 10, No. 22, p820 (1909-11-10).
Raum-Zeit-Koordinaten is the only occurrence.

Here is a reference from 1906 (and below [in an update] from 1896).
"THE TEACHING OF MECHANICS BY EXPERIMENT"
C.E. ASHFORD
included in "The Teaching of Elementary Mechanics" by John Perry, 1906

and in
 The School World, p.335-339.
At the bottom of page 337

The diagram (Fig.2) shows one of the ordinary trolleys on its plane.
With this a boy can produce and measure uniform velocity and acceleration.
Every experiment with a trolley provides him with a space-time diagram ready made
...
and he can plot his velocity-time and acceleration-time curves from it.

update
Here's an 1896 reference
"Experimental determination of the motion of projectiles inside the bore of a gun with the polarizing photo-chronograph" by Crehore, Albert and Squier, George, p. 348
https://archive.org/details/1896Experimental_photo_chronograph-BP34-6/page/348/mode/2up

The pressure which corresponds to the constant acceleration
...
This value, which is the probable pressure along the part of the bore where the parabola applies, it will be seen might have been much greater near the seat of the projectile without making very much change in the space-time or velocity-space curves.
...
The parabola in this case representing the space-time curve has its origin to the left of the vertical axis instead of upon it as in the previous case. The true space-time curve must manifestly pass through the origin as the time is counted from the instant when the projectile started.
...
The points on the velocity-time curve II are obtained by erecting ordinates equal to the tangent of inclination to the space-time curve I.

Using a search on Google Books ( https://books.google.com/ ) for "Raumzeit" (no hyphen, but include the quotes in the search), restricted to 19th century (an option of Tools, in the upper right),
here are some uses of "Raumzeit".

I'll just include screenshots...

Sorry I can't easily transcribe and proofread the German text.
I'll leave it to others to interpret the use of the term in these contexts.

p18-19:

By changing the range to 1700-1800, this came up... presumably an earlier version of the 1803 one.
