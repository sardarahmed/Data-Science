Q:

References about the the development of the concept of mechanical work

I'm looking for references about how the concept of mechanical work ("$\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{r}$") or the concept of mechanical power ("$\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}$") came about and developed. Please note that I'm not asking about virtual work and its related principle, and that I'm asking for references rather than direct reports as this question asks.
I consulted Truesdell & Toupin's The Classical Field Theories (Springer 1960), which usually provides many historical references, and Dugas's A History of Mechanics (Griffon 1955), but I didn't find very much in either. I know of Jammer's Concepts of Force, but I found so many nonsensical statements in that book that I don't trust it anymore.
I'd be very grateful if you could share any other references you know. Thank you!
