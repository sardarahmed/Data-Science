Q:

What is the source of Hermann Weyl's remark about "near-sighted policemen" with respect to compact spaces?

Hermann Weyl is widely reported as making the following observation about a compact space:
"If a city is compact, it can be guarded by a finite number of arbitrarily near-sighted policemen."
This was reported in a paper by Edwin Hewitt in a 1960 paper in AMM, and hence more widely propagated since. (I first encountered it in W.A. Sutherland's "Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces" (Oxford Science Publications, 1975).)
However, I am having difficulty tracking down the precise origin. (Weyl wrote prolifically.)
Does anyone know where he first made that remark?

A:

The closest match I could find is in H. Weyl, "Harmonics on homogeneous manifolds." Annals of Mathematics, Second Series, Vol. 35, No. 3, July 1934, pp. 486-499, as reproduced in K. Chandrasekharan (ed.), "Hermann Weyl: Gesammelte Abhandlungen Band III," Springer 1968. On page 389 of "Gesammelte Abhandlungen":

A "finite" country can be watched by a finite number of policemen, however small the radius of action of the single policeman may be!
