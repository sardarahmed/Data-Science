Q:

What group theoretic results were known for several special cases before the general definition of a group was established?

Many results in group theory were proven for permutation groups before the general definition of a group was established (for example: Lagrange's theorem, Sylow's theorems). However, permutation groups weren't the only groups being studied in the nineteenth century, there were also groups of geometric transformations and group arising from number theory (I can't really give more details because I don't frankly know the details).
Were any general group theory results known for several specific cases other than just permutation groups, before the general definition of a group had been formulated? I ask because I'm wondering if such "coincidences" could have motivated the general definition of a group. As an example, Lagrange's theorem was known in the 19th century both for permutation groups and for the multiplicative group of $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ (via Euler).

A:

The article The Abstract Group Concept, from the McTutor archive, gives an accounting of the steps towards the modern abstract definition. In brief, Cayley made the first stumbling attempts (citing the associative law explicitly) in an 1854 paper, but not until 1895 did Weber give the modern definition, in his Lehrbuch der Algebra. Weber included infinite groups.
As for the original question: other than the Lagrange theorem you mention, I'm not aware of any cases where the abstract definition unified previous separate results. The abstract definition does not seem to have been motivated by this desire. However, it is true that Lie groups were directly inspired by Galois's permutation groups, and Lie's desire to develop a theory for differential equations analogous to Galois theory. 
It also seems plausible that Weber, writing a comprehensive text on Algebra, saw the possibility of uniting disparate notions. But that's just a conjecture on my part.
