Q:

Where and how did scientists of the 18th and 19th century learn foreign languages?

I'm always amazed by the the apparent amount of foreign languages that scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries seem to have possessed. With the end of Latin as the main scholarly language, researchers started to write in their mother tongue. I'm aware that sometimes papers got translated when they were reprinted in a foreign journal, which was pretty common back then (the reprinting, not the translation as far as I knowâ€¦), but it seems obvious for example in the field of botany in Germany, that people had to have a command (at least to the level of a reading comprehension) of at least Latin, French, and English in order to participate in scholarly discourse.
I was wondering where and how scientists acquired those skills, or if this is a case where there is a nowadays unknown army of translators that facilitated the discourse and bridged the gap in that way.
P.S.: I asked this question on the history SE as well.

A:

A typcial gymnasium in Germany in the 19th century would offer courses in Latin, Ancient Greek and French, as well as in Hebrew (probably only for Jewish students). If you wanted to learn other languages (Gauss started learning Russian when he was quite old already) you needed a tutor. For scientific purposes, Latin, French and German covered more than 90 % of the important literature during much of the 19th century. In mathematics, there exist several translations of German texts into French, but I am not aware of a single translation of a French text into German during the 19th century.
Another way of learning languages was the "grand tour", which was fashionable up to the early 18th century.
