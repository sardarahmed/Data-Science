Q:

Were $\sigma$-algebras defined for probability?

If you want a crash course in $\sigma$-algebras and probability spaces, you should absolutely read this amazing answer by @Sycorax on Cross Validated. Sycorax says something in particular though that jumps out at me:

The three requirements of a $\sigma$-field can be considered as consequences of what we would like to do with probability: A $\sigma$-field is a set that has three properties:

Closure under countable unions.
Closure under countable intersections.
Closure under complements.

According to my literal interpretation, this suggests that the defining characteristics of a $\sigma$-algebra (which are usually phrased a bit differently it seems) were formulated with probability spaces in mind.  Then again, the notion of something and its formal definition often come at different times.
Therefore, I have two closely related questions:

Was the notion of a $\sigma$-algebra devised with probability spaces in mind?
Were the points in the (widespread) definition of $\sigma$-algebras formulated with probability spaces in mind?

I haven’t found any online sources that reference the history of $\sigma$-algebras other than this explanation of the etymology of the $\sigma$.

A:

No and no, I am afraid. Those things are not specific to probability, we do them with logical connectives, which parallel set operations, and with areas and volumes, just as well as with probabilities. And countable additivity is not necessarily natural for some classical applications (e.g. to natural number frequencies), it is a technical assumption. Indeed, Kolmogorov's Foundations of the theory of probability (1933), that axiomatized probability in terms of measure theory, does not ask that the collection of sets be a $\sigma$-field in the initial five axioms, only a field, and that the probability measure be $\sigma$-additive, only finitely additive. Countable fields only appear in chapter II, and he formulates the last axiom in terms of measure continuity, not additivity. 
The concept of set field he borrows from Hausdorff's Grundzüge der Mengenlehre (1914, English translation), which is not addressing probability at all. And the idea of considering collections of sets (or rather classes back then) closed under standard operations goes back to Boole and de Morgan, who were not even doing measure theory, they were interested in logic. Measure theory was originally developed for the case of real number line, with Peano-Jordan, Borel and Lebesgue introducing set functions on systems of sets, whose properties were eventually packaged into set fields, $\sigma$-fields, and $\sigma$-algebras. 
Borel was the first to require $\sigma$-additivity in Leçons sur la théorie des fonctions (1898), but his interest in probability only develops  around 1905. Lebesgue took a more abstract view of sets beyond subsets of a line in 
Leçons sur l'intégration et la recherche des fonctions primitives (1904), although he states his conditions in terms of integrals rather than measures. Neither Lebesgue nor Hausdorff were much involved with probability theory. A short review of this gradual measure-theoretic abstraction process is Le processus d'abstraction dans le développement des premières théories de la mesure by Villeneuve (it is in French but Google produces a decent translation).
