Q:

Did Einstein get inspired by projective geometry?

I read somewhere that projective geometry was an inspiration to Einstein to build the theory of relativity. However, the keyword "projective geometry" isn't mentioned in history of general relativity and only passingly in history of special relativity that Clifford had contributions to the field.
Though the connection has been showed later by Penrose (1984), did it really inspire Einstein? If yes, how? If no, then what really intuitively inspired him?

A:

It is hard to prove that the answer is negative, but have this in mind: a friend who helped Einstein a lot (and who co-wrote two articles with him) while Einstein was trying to formulate the General Theory of Relativity was Marcel Grossmann, who was a geometer (his PhD thesis was about Non-Euclidean Geometry and he wrote two textbooks on Descriptive Geometry). However, the Geometry that he used to help Einstein was the tensor calculus which was developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita, not Projective Geometry.
