Q:

Collection of open problems in Partial differential equations

Except Navier-Stokes equation, are there any other interesting open problems in partial differential equations?   
I want to know the collection of problems, which are easy to understand but difficult to solve. Like in number theory, we have Goldbach conjecture which is easy to understand, but still unsolved.

A:

This is a collection of open problems concerning various areas in function theory, functional analysis, theory of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations.
