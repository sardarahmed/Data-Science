Q:

Who first proved that $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$?

Who first proved the interchangeability of partial derivatives? I never see any reference in textbooks. This is not a trivial result. 

A:

It looks as if it was Euler who first proved it. See A note on the history of mixed partial derivatives, by Thomas James Higgins (Scripta Mathematica 7 (1940), pp. 59–62).

A:

This question could also be asked as: Who first found an example for the not-interchangeability of partial derivatives?
It was H.A. Schwarz who proved the theorem: If a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ is $m$ times differentiable and continuous, then the $m$th mixed derivatives are independent of the order.
