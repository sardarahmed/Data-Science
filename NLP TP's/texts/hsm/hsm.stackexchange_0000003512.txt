Q:

Have there been accurate alternative clocks/ways to tell time?

As I understand it, pretty much everybody uses the "Babylonian/sexagesimal" time format: 12/24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.
Have there been alternative systems to accurately tell time?
Or maybe there are still some in existence?
By "accurately" I mean that one can tell an exact time, i.e. not the "some time during the morning"-type.
Also, let's exclude inventions that were never properly used over a longer period, e.g. decimal time during the French Revolution.

A:

French Revolutionary time had ten hours to the day, 100 minutes to the hour, and 100 secnds to the minute. That same article describes a couple of other instances of decimal time.

A:

"Swahili time" is essentially the same as contemporary standard time, synchronized at sunrise / sunset (6:00), so it has the same 12/24 system. There is a Chinese time unit the ke, 14.4 minutes, but it apparently co-existed with a duodecimal system so one can suspect that it was added to a duodecimal system, used exclusively (as far as I can determine) with months.
