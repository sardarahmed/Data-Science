Q:

What did Galileo's "pulsilogon" look like?

Reading how Galileo measured time in the experiment with inclined plane, it says on Wikipedia, that:

Galileo accurately measured these short periods of time by creating a pulsilogon. This was a machine created to measure time using a pendulum.[15] The pendulum was synchronized to the human pulse. He used this to measure the time at which the weighted balls passed marks that he had made on the inclined plane.

However, I am unable to find any drawing or reference to what it actually looked like.
According to other source I found, Galileo actually used a guitar and by listening to string rhythms/frequencies he could measure subseconds intervals.
Does anyone have a reference to how it really was?

A:

According to the medical journal article The History of Instrumental Precision in Medicine, referring to the pulsilogon :

Unclaimed by Galileo, it was attributed to Paolo Sarpi, and clearly enough was appropriated at a later date by that notable genius, Sanctorius, who also, like Galileo, called it the pulsilogon. We have no drawing of Galileo’s pulsilogon, but it must have been identical with the simpler form as shown in Sanctorius.

The Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society article Recreating the Pulsilogium of Sanctorius details a recent attempt to reconstruct the various types of pulsilogia attributed to Sanctorius and includes the following etching:

However, the same article includes the following comment on the relation between Galileo's instrument and that of Sanctorius:

All the scholars who dealt with Galileo and his studies on motion, simply assumed that Santorio’s pulsilogium was a direct outcome of the former’s research into the properties of the pendulum. Unfortunately, there are many major problems with this hypothesis. The most important of which is that it takes no account of Santorio’s words and further assumes the primacy of Galileo’s over Santorio’s studies that is historically groundless.
