Q:

When, and by whom was the Schwarzschild metric first taken to be valid for all radii greater than zero?

The metric was originally defined to be valid only from the surface of a black hole outward but somewhere along the line it was extended inward to include the region under the event horizon.
This extension of the metric was, of course, what gave us the definition of Schwarzschild black hole and I've been curious for some time about how the extension first came about and who did it.

A:

The story is told in Eisenstaedt’s book (2006, Chap. 12) or papers (1982, 1987, 1989) (also jstor).
Briefly he says that, while Schwarzschild and Droste’s original works (1916, 1916, 1917)  ignored the region $r\leqslant 2m$ (Schwarzschild actually used $\smash{\tilde r=(r^3-8m^3)^{1/3}}$ > 0 as his radial coordinate), other early papers like Hilbert (1917, p. 70), Eddington (1920, p. 97) or Lodge (1921, p. 555) did use the metric for all $r$ > 0. Putative crossing under the $r=2m$ “singularity” was also discussed at a 1922 Paris seminar of Einstein, as reported by Nordmann (1922, pp. 154-156) and Brillouin (1923).
The possibility was dismissed then, and apparently never seriously considered again until the early 1960s, when people discussed extended metrics.
(Eisenstaedt also notes that Weyl had pioneered such an extension in (1917, p. 131; 1918, p. 205), but removed it from later editions of his book.)
