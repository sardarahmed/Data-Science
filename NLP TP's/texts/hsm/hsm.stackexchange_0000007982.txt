Q:

What are historical applications of geometry to measuring distances beyond human reach?

I am searching for books and articles about applications of Geometry, in particular to the problem of computing distances and lengths which are apparently beyond human reach. As an example, consider the computations of the size of the Earth by Eratosthenes and by Al-Biruni. I am particularly interested in those cases in which (as in the examples that I mentioned) it is known that those methods were actually used in practice.

A:

For the down to Earth geometry see Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome by Lewis. For the astronomical measurements, which aside from the names mentioned would include Aristarchus, Ptolemy, see Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley by van Helden. The Mathematics of the Heavens and the Earth by van Brummelen focuses specifically on applications of trigonometry. The History of Stellar Measurement website lists some more recent applications to the parallax measurements.
