Q:

Portrait of Stephen Butterworth

Does anybody know of a portrait of British physicist Stephen Butterworth (1885-1958)?

A:

Edit: Apparently, Prof. Silage made a mistake and used a wrong picture for his book. So, the mystery remains. The obituary in "Times," if someone can access it, might contain a picture.

Old answer:
Here is a picture. The page is taken from Chapter 2, "Frequency Domain Analysis" in Dennis Silage, "Analog and Digital Communications." Where did Silage find the photograph I do not know, you can email him and ask.
