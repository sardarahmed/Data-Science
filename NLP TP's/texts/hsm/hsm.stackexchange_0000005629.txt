Q:

Analysis vs Synthesis in Greek Mathematics

I am trying to understand the difference in "analysis" and "synthesis" as used by the ancient Greek mathematicians. Most sources characterize synthesis as working from givens to a desired conclusion, and analysis as starting from a conclusion and working back to its cause. What would be an example of the Greeks doing this? It seems that all arguments I have read in Euclid's Elements would be synthetic.
Additionally, what is the connection between the historical and modern usages of these terms? Why did calculus come to be called "real analysis"?

A:

See Anaysis in Ancient Greek Geometry:

What analysis involves is the finding of appropriate principles, previously proved theorems, and constructional moves by means of which the problem can be solved (the desired figure constructed or the relevant theorem proved).

Synthesis instead, as you say, is the "standard" deductive approach: from postulates to theorems.
With Early Modern mathematics, the new algebraic techniques was often called "analytical"; see e.g François Viète  and his :

In Artem Analyticien Isagoge (Introduction to the art of analysis) (1591), Chapter I, English translation, page 11:

There is a certain way for searching for the truth in mathematics that Plato is said first to have discovered. Theon called it analysis...

Thus, analysis became a sort of catchword for any new mathematical "tools" and methods.
