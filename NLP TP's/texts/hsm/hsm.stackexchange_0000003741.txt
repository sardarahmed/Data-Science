Q:

Why choose symbol $\sum$ to be the summation operator in maths?

AFAIK there's rare evidence to show that  $\sum$ has the meaning of "sum" in Greek, so why mathematician chose  $\sum$ to be the summation operator?

A:

See Forian Cajori, A History of Mathematical Notations (1928, also Dover reprint), Vol.II, page 61:

438. The sign $\Sigma$ for summation is due to Leonhard Euler, Institutiones calculi differentialis (St.Petersburg, 1755), Cap.I,ยง26, page 27, who says:

summam indicabimus signo $\Sigma$.

This symbol was used by Lagrange but otherwise received little attention during the eighteenth century. [...] The $\Sigma$ to express "sum" occurs in 1829 in Fourier's Theory of Heat, published in 1822, and in C.G.J. Jacobi's Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum (1829).

Note We have to take into account that the latin sum was already the source for Leibniz's symbol $\int$ for integral:

Utile erit scribi $\int$ pro omnia, ut $\int l = \text {omn.} l$, id est summa ipsorum $l$.
