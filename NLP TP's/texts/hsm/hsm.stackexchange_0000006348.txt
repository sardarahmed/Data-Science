Q:

How did Archimedes arrive at his principle in his time?

Archimedes principle:

Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a stationary fluid, is
  buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the
  object.

I get that this can be shown with force calculations on an object in a fluid. But how come this fact was suddenly so obvious to someone taking a bath thousands of years ago?

A:

The bath is a later legend. The principle can be discovered and proved by the following argument which requires no calculation. Suppose that a body is submerged by water.
The force with which water acts on it is the pressure on the surface of the body.
Now replace the inside of the body by water. Then we have just water in water and nothing moves (equilibrium). Which means that the weight of the water inside the surface is equal to the pressure of the water outside of the surface. But this last pressure evidently does not depend on what's inside the surface. This proves the Archimedes law.
This was Archimedes's own argument, given in his book "On Floating bodies".
All stories about bath and crown and bull's sacrifice and Eureka were invented by later biographers.
