Q:

Background of 'Eisenstein series'

It's my first question.
I am studying elliptic function, Among them, I have a question about the Weierstrass elliptic function.
In the Weierstrass elliptic function, their coefficients are expressed by 'Eisenstein series'. So I was so curious about origin of eisenstein series. When I search about it, 'Eisenstein series' was discovered by 'Kronecker-Weber theorem' and 'Jugendtraum'.
But I want to know about this more detail.

A:

Andre Weil, Elliptic functions according to Eisenstein and Kronecher, Springer-Verlag, NY 1976.

A:

See the book "Elliptic and Modular Functions from Gauss to Dedekind to Hecke" by Ranjan Roy.  It is a very rich source of material on the history of topics related to modular functions. Using this book I was able to answer a question I once asked here about the origin of the Jacobi product formula for the discriminant modular function $\Delta(t)$: see here.
