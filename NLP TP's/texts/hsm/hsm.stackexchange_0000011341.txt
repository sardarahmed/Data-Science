Q:

Why is the existential quantifier symbol ∃ a backwards "E"?

Peano introduced a number of logical symbols still used today:

$∨$ (from Latin vel)
$∧$ (inverted $∨$)
$∃$

This inversion of Latin letters as symbols (and inversion of symbols to signify their 'opposite' operation) was followed by later logicians:

$∀$ (Gentzen, 1935: inverted A from "All-Zeichen" / "Für Alle", by analogy to $∃$)
$⊥$ (inverted $⊤$)

I had always assumed that ∃ stood for "E" in "Existential" / "there Exists" (or some cognate thereof), but Peano did not appear to use any words beginning 'e' in the paragraph this symbol was introduced:

Mais nous préférons l'indiquer par la nouvelle notation
$$Ǝa$$
qu'on peut lire « il y a des $a$ ».

Formulaire de mathématiques, Peano (1897)

So why did he choose an inverted "E"?

Is the symbol for set membership $\in$ derived from greek letter $\epsilon$?
Math SE: What came first, the ∀ or the ∃? 

A:

When introducing the older terminology in the previous sentence, Peano describes it thus:

... signifie "il y a des a", "les a existent"...

It seems likely this is the source of the inverted "E".
