Q:

Cavendish Laboratories Photo, 1939

So this photo of the Cavendish Laboratory is from 1939, and I was wondering if anyone knew any more about who was in the photo. (Click to enlarge)

From notes I've been given, I believe the front row is:
DE Lea?; Unknown; ME Oliphant; Norman Feather; GFC Searle; Bragg Jr; John Cockroft; Philip Dee; James Chadwick or CTR Wilson? Miss Davies; Unknown
The second row definitely has Sam Devons (5th from left; dark shirt), and there's some suggestion that the man to his left (i.e. 4th from left on 2nd row) is Hermann Bondi; Eric Wild is in the 3rd row (4th from left)
Edit: Context of the photo. I don't know anything more about why it was taken other than it being the yearly (1939) photo of the department's Faculty Staff and Graduates; a family member has inherited it as his father is in it.
Any help, contributions or suggestions appreciated!
Thank you.

So in answer to my own question, I've since emailed Cambridge and had a fantastically helpful reply: they've sent me a photo of the the fully named / annotated original photo.

Hope this might be of interest to some.
