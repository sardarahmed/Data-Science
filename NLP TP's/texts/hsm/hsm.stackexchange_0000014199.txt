Q:

Is there any theorem/physical law with different names in more than two different languages/regions?

Mathematical statements and physics equations often are named after a person (like Pythagoras theorem or Newton's second law). Reading from different authors with different origins one may sometimes find a common statement with a different name. I have usually seen this in French and Russian sources, where Snell's law became Descartes' law and Gauss' theorem became Ostrogradsky's theorem respectively.
Is there a law/theorem well known for having many different names/authors depending on the language/region? I am looking for more than 2 names/languages/regions.

A:

I think that what you asking for is not so rare, for example the "Rouché-Capelli theorem" is

Rouché–Capelli theorem in English speaking countries, Italy, Brazil and Japan;
Kronecker–Capelli theorem in Austria, Poland, Romania and Russia;
Rouché–Fontené theorem in France;
Rouché–Frobenius theorem in Spain and many countries in Latin America;
Frobenius theorem in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia.

Another example, certainly less conspicuous, is the "law of cosines" that in France is the théorème d'Al-Kashi (but also loi des cosinus is common), and "generalized Pythagorean theorem" in many countries where the two names coexist (in France again, but also in Italy).

The richest example in this regard according to me is the WKB approximation. WKB approximation, which is technically not a theorem but a recipe for obtaining approximate solutions to the time-independent Schrodinger equation, is named after Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin. However, the technique is called by different names by/at different people/places:

In Holland, it is called the KWB.
In France, it is called the BWK.
In England, it is called the JWKB with 'J' standing for Jeffreys.
In the scientific community it is also known by the name LG or Liouville–Green method.
