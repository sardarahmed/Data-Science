Q:

Scientific progress claimed to be caused by dreaming

Kekulé, who discovered the chemical formula for benzene in 1865, claimed that he had guessed the ring formula with the alternating single and double bonds in a day-dream. Are there similar examples of significant scientific progress claimed to be caused by dreaming?

A:

Indian mathematician  Srinivasa Ramanujan claimed and is often said to have come up with theorems and questions in his dreams.
For example: Ramanujan's Mock Modular Forms: Indian Mathematician's Dream Conjecture Finally Proven

While on his death bed, the brilliant Indian mathematician Srinivasa
  Ramanujan cryptically wrote down functions he said came to him in
  dreams, with a hunch about how they behaved. Now 100 years later,
  researchers say they've proved he was right.
"We've solved the problems from his last mysterious letters. For
  people who work in this area of math, the problem has been open for 90
  years," Emory University mathematician Ken Ono said.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to verify such claims. But regardless I have always found Srinivasa Ramanujan's achievements amazing.
