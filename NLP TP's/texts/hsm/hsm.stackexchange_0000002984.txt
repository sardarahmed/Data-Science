Q:

History of impact of non-Euclidean geometry on math, philosophy, and the public

I'm interested in the impact of the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry on math, philosophy, and the attitudes of the general public.
I don't know anything about how things changed right after the discoveries in the 1840's. My knowledge starts at Cantor and continues forward. 
By way of examples: What did mathematicians think about the loss of certainty in their field? 
How did philosophers process this development?
As regards the public; my understanding is that this when postmodernism and the culture wars began. If there are mutually inconsistent geometries, then perhaps we're each entitled to our own subjective reality. How did the world get from there to here? Is that a generally accepted view of the social impact? Where can I read more about it?
I've heard of Kline's book on the Loss of Certainty. Is that something I should read?
Thanks much.

A:

Regarding :

Morris Kline, Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty (1982)

the answer is : yes; Ch.IV The First Debacle : The Withering of Truth is dedicated to non-Eucliidean geometry, and it is worth to be read.
More details into :

BA Rosenfeld, A history of non-euclidean geometry (1988)
Jeremy Gray, Worlds Out of Nothing: A Course in the History of Geometry in the 19th Century (2007)
Jeremy Gray, Plato's Ghost: The Modernist Transformation of Mathematics (2008).

For a more "philosophical" point of view, see :

Roberto Torretti, Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincaré (1978).

For an overview, see also Nineteenth Century Geometry, Kant's Views on Space and Time, Hermann von Helmholtz and Henri Poincaré.
