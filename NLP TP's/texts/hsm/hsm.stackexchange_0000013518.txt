Q:

What hair color did Évariste Galois have?

There is one historic black and white portrait of Évariste Galois that is often used [1]. However there are a number of more recent colorful portraits that imagine him to be anything from straw blond[2], things in between[3], brown[4] and black[5].
Is there any historical source that describes his hair color?
Are there arguments to that would suggest that in [1] his hair is not only black because of the medium such as that other hair colors like brown and blond were historically portrayed differently in that medium?
A sourced answer to any of these two questions would suffice. If there is indirect information (such as the color of the hair of his parent is verifiable to a similar standard of proof as asked for above) that is welcome too.
I am aware that modern recoloration are not a reliable source but the variety of hair color he is portrayed with suggests this fact is not know or easily googleable.

A:

Galois was imprisoned twice, at Sainte-Pélagie prison in 1831 and at La Force prison in 1832. The prison records are apparently retained in French archives.
His prison record from Sainte-Pélagie is reproduced (as text only) in the following article, a scan of which is available from NUMDAM:
P. Dupuy, "La vie d’Évariste Galois", Annales scientifiques de l’É.N.S. 3e série, tome 13 (1896), p. 197-266.
On page 264 of the article:

Cheveux ..... chatains
Sourcils .... id.

The color of his hair is described as chestnut, and the color of his eyebrows identical to the hair color. An online article shows a cropped picture of Galois's second prison record:
Olivier Courcelle, "Galois à La Force", CNRS Images des mathématiques, January 22, 2017
In the picture shown at the top of the webpage:

cheveux et sourcils  chatains-bruns

Both hair and eyebrows are described as having chestnut-brown color.
