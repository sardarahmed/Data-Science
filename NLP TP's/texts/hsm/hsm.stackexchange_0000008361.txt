Q:

Does the “O” in the google doodle for Olga Ladyzhenskaya have anything to do with her work?

Ladyzhenskaya is famous for fluid dynamics and partial differential equations, both of which are beyond my pay grade. And she worked on the Navier-Stokes equations. Does this circle with the arrows represent anything in particular?
All I know from differential equations is that they sometimes involve arrows in "direction fields", which may be a connection.

A:

The equation in the picture is the Navier–Stokes momentum equation in convective form. The part inside the O looks  like a cross-section of (the velocity field of) a flow between two rotating cylinders, mentioned in Ladyzhenskaya's Mathematical Analysis of Navier-Stokes Equations for Incompressible Liquids, 6.4, among other places, the so-called Taylor-Couette flow (spiral vortex). But this is not something Ladyzhenskaya worked on specifically. 
It is also similar to a picture of (the direction field of) an unstable spiral surrounded by a limit cycle. Those appear in some finite-dimensional reductions of the Navier-Stokes equations (see e.g. Wang Five-Mode System of the Navier-Stokes Equations on a Torus), but this is even further from what she worked on. So it could just be a cute picture of a "fluid flow" that fits nicely into letter O.
