Q:

Egyptian number system?

How did ancient Egyptians know that they have to choose the symbols for multiple of 10 in their Egyptian number system, since at that time hindu-arabic system was not there and no one knows what is 1,2,3,...or 10?

A:

The Egyptian language, like most languages of the world, has a counting system based implicitly on base 10. This is much older than any system of mathematical notation. When the Egyptians began writing numbers they reflected the counting system which existed in their language.
