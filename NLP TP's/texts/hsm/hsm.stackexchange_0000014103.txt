Q:

Ancient Egyptian Mathematicians

Greek and Muslim Egyptian mathematicians are well known throughout the world. But the only Ancient Egyptian mathematician I know of is Ahmes, who said he's just a scribe. Who were the greatest Egyptian mathematicians of Ancient times?

A:

We don't know. The documents we have concerning Egyptian and Babylonian Mathematics do not contain the names of their creators.
