Q:

Who is/was R. Alter, who reported 1375298099 can be expressed as the sum of 3 fifth powers in 2 different ways?

David Wells, in his entertaining but non-scholarly Curious and Interesting Numbers (1986, 2 ed. 1997) reports that the positive integer $1 \, 375 \, 298 \, 099$ can be expressed as the sum of $3$ fifth powers in $2$ different ways:
$$1 \, 375 \, 298 \, 099 = 24^5 + 28^5 + 67^5 = 3^5 + 54^5 + 62^5$$
He gives the source as "R. Alter" but I can find no reference to this person.
I have seen a suggestion that his first name may be Roland, but I can't find any justification for this.
(MathWorld has a page on this: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiophantineEquation5thPowers.html in which it is stated that this is the smallest number with this property.)
Can anyone help me out with any information about R. Alter?

A:

The particular dual sum-of-powers representations of $1375298099$ from the question appear in Table 4 of
Ronald Alter, "Computations and generalizations on a remark of Ramanujan." In: Marvin I. Knopp (ed.), Analytic Number Theory: Proceedings of a Conference Held at Temple University, Philadelphia, May 12-15, 1980 (Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 899; Springer 1981).
This table is on page 190. The conference was organized on the occasion of the retirement of Alter's Ph.D. thesis advisor Emil Grosswald from Temple University.
The earliest mention of Ronald Alter in the literature I could find is in a list of new members of the American Mathematical Society in the following publication:
John W. Green and Morton L. Curtis, "The Annual meeting in Miami", Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 70, 1964, pp. 343-356 (scan). On page 351:

University of Pennsylvania: Ronald Alter, Robert H. Cantor, [...]

Per his record at the Mathematics Genealogy Project, Ronald Alter received his Ph.D. in 1965 from the University of Pennsylvania. The title of his Ph.D. thesis is: On a Necessary Condition for the Validity of the Riemann Hypothesis for Functions that Generalize the Riemann Zeta Function. A publication based on the Ph.D. thesis appeared in 1968; Alter's affiliation is stated as University of California, Los Angeles.
Ronald Alter, "On a necessary condition for the validity of the Riemann hypothesis for functions that generalize the Riemann zeta function." Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 130, No. 1, 1968, pp. 55-74 (scan).
After receiving his Ph.D., Alter briefly joined the faculty of UCLA. General Catalog University of California, Los Angeles, Regents of the University of California 1966, p. 319:

Ronald Alter, Ph.D., Acting Assistant Professor of Mathematics.

Two papers published in 1968 state Alter's affiliation as System Development Corporation, Santa Monica, California. SDC was one of the first computer software companies, founded in 1955. The first of these two papers states that Alter is a postdoctoral fellow.

Ronald Alter joined the faculty of the University of Kentucky in 1970. In Notices of the American Mathematical Society, Volume 17, Number 5, August 1970, p. 735:

Professor RONALD ALTER of System Development Corporation has been appointed to an associate professorship at the University of Kentucky.

The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 77, 1970, p. 1035:

Assistant Professor Ronald Alter, University of Kentucky, has been promoted to Associate Professor

I cannot find any publication by Alter after 1980, or in fact any other information on him after that year. All publications from 1970 through 1980 state his affiliation as University of Kentucky, and later ones more specifically mention the Department of Computer Science.
In online information I found people called Ronald Alter, e.g. multiple ones born between 1934 and 1939 in the 1940 United States Census, or one in a 1958 highschool yearbook, but it is impossible to determine at this time whether any of them are identical to the mathematician Ronald Alter. I have not been able to find a relevant obituary.
