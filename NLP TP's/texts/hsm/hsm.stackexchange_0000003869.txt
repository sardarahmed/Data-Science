Q:

Origin of the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma

When and where did Riemann and Lebesgue give the well known Riemann-Lebesgue lemma? A "lemma"  is usually used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a statement of interest by itself. Did Riemann and Lebesgue intend to prove a larger result when they gave this work?

A:

Here's a partial answer regarding the when and where with links to the papers.  Riemann proved the Riemann-Lebesgue result for bounded Riemann integrable functions in his habilitation paper "Über die Darstellbarkeit einer Function durch eine trigonometrische Reihe".  He wrote the paper in 1853 (presented in 1854), but it was only published posthumously in 1867.  Lebesgue proved the result for $L^1$ functions in his 1903 paper "Sur les séries trigonométriques", which was published in Annales scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure.
