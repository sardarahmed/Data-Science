Q:

Who discovered the difference between the infinities?

As we know, there is a difference between the (infinite) size (or cardinality) of the integer numbers and the size of the reals ($\aleph_0$ and $\mathfrak c=2^{\aleph_0}$).
Who discovered it first?

A:

Georg Cantor discovered it.
You can see at least : The Early Development of Set Theory :

in late 1873, came a surprising discovery that fully opened the realm of the transfinite. In correspondence with Dedekind, Cantor asked the question whether the infinite sets $\mathbb N$ of the natural numbers and $\mathbb R$ of real numbers can be placed in one-to-one correspondence. In reply, Dedekind offered a surprising proof that the set $A$ of all algebraic numbers is denumerable (i.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb N$). A few days later, Cantor was able to prove that the assumption that $\mathbb R$ is denumerable leads to a contradiction. To this end, he employed the Bolzano-Weierstrass principle of completeness. Thus he had shown that there are more elements in $\mathbb R$ than in $\mathbb N$ or $\mathbb Q$ or $A$, in the precise sense that the cardinality of $\mathbb R$ is strictly greater than that of $\mathbb N$.
