Q:

Is the name of German company Siemens related to the unit of conductance?

We have heard about the name of the famous German company Siemens.My friend said that this is because they were the first to introduce conductance bridges and hence named after the unit of conductance Siemens.
But in the Wikipedia article I saw that Siemens was founded by Werner von Siemens and thus the name.
So,is my friend wrong?What is the real reason behind the name?
Thanks for any help!!

A:

The unit "Siemens" was only introduced in 1971 whereas the company was founded the mid-19th century.
Both get their name from the same person, Werner von Siemens.
