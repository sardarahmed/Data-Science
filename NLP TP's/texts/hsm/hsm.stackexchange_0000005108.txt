Q:

What were standard university texts in algebra in the mid 19th century?

Dedekind in 1872 wrote that equations like  $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3}=\sqrt{6}$ ``to the best of my knowledge have never been established before'' (Continuity and Irrational Numbers, p. 22).  This was not a crazy thing to say but it makes me wonder what were the standard textbook treatments at the time.  A book like Rouse Ball History of the Study of Mathematics at Cambridge would be ideal for this question, except that it's account of instruction ends with the 18th century and it covers the 19th century only in  connection with the Tripos.

Here's an example of early 19th century textbooks (from my answer here):
Cauchy entered the lycée ("high school") École Centrale du Panthéon in 1802, studying humanities. Then, in 1805 he entered the École Polytechnique at age 15.
The "core" mathematics curriculum at the École Polytechnique was:

Analysis instruction: the Cours d'Analyse Algébrique by Garnier and
  the Traité Élémentaire de Calcul Différentiel et Intégral by
  Lacroix;
Mechanics instruction: the Traité de Mécanique, using the methods of Prony and edited by Francoeur and the Plan Raisonne du Cours de Prony;
Descriptive geometry instruction: the Géométrie Descriptive by Monge;
Applied analysis instruction: the Feuilles d'Analyse Appliquée a la
  Géométrie by Monge and the Application de l’Algèbre à la Géométrie
  by Monge and Hachette.

(Belhoste, Bruno. Augustin-Louis Cauchy: A Biography. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1991. pp. 7-10. Appendix II is Cauchy's outlines of his analysis courses he taught at the École Polytechnique from 1816-1819.
See the distribution of courses at the École Polytechnique when Cauchy was a student there.)
