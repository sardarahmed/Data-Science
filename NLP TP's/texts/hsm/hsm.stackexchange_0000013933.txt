Q:

What was the first time that a Physical quantity was squared to describe a physical phenomenon?

When was the first time we see a square in an equation describing some physical effect?
Well, there is the area of circle (or square of course ...), but a circle area is not - in this question definition at least - a physical phenomenon. An example of a physical phenomenon would be the lever, but we see no square there, rather a simple multiplication of a quantity with another quantity: $M_a*D_a = M_b*D_b$. The equation: $E_v=\frac{mv^2}{2}$ on the other hand, is a qualified example where we square a quantity. But there are, I suppose, much earlier examples of this. What are they?

A:

I'm not sure if the following satisfy your notion of physical phenomenon. I suggest Babylonian "System B" for planet motions. According to this system planets move around zodiac with constantly increasing speed for some time and then they move with constantly decreasing speed. That is, they approximate planet speed as a piecewise linear function. Then they need to square time to calculate the distance the planet travel. That is, they used formula $d=\frac{at^2}{2}$ for motion with constant acceleration.
