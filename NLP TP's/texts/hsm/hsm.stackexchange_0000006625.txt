Q:

Why did Euclid Avoid Using the 5th Postulate?

In Euclid's elements, some of the theorems (e.g. SAA congruence) can be proven using the parallel postulate, much easier than without it. But it seems that Euclid has intentionally avoided using it, when possible.

Am I right?
What is the reason behind this choice?

A:

If he avoided use of that postulate where he saw that it is possible to do like that he did it most likely in the spirit of proving results with minimal assumptions, so that result proven in such a way will hold for some axiom systems different than the one used by him in his books, and different in the sense that those alternative axiom systems will contain some of his axioms but not all, so, if he proved that something is true without the usage of parallel postulate then he proved also that it is true with the usage of parallel postulate, so he most likely did it all in the spirit of trying to be as general as possible, and aware of the fact that other axioms systems and geometries are also possible.
