Q:

Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum with regular polygons: in which nesting order?

Kepler tried to use regular polygons before using the 3D platonic solids in his Mysterium Cosmographicum.
My question is: which regular polygons did Kepler try to use and in what nesting order?

A:

In the preface to Mysterium Cosmographicum, Kepler wrote that he first saw that an equilateral triangle fit well between the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter.
Noting that this triangle was the first of the regular polygons, he tried to continue the sequence with a square in the second interval (between Jupiter and Mars), a pentagon in the third (between Mars and Earth), and a hexagon in the fourth (between Earth and Venus).
He had already noticed that there was an incorrect fit between Jupiter and Mars, so he tried nesting a square, triangle, and pentagon in this interval. (The order is not clear from the text.) This is the sum of the information he gave on his attempts. He noted that finding a correct combination of polygons for each case would be "an endless pursuit of detail" ("Infinitum est singula persequi").
He abandoned using polygons largely because they did not give a mathematical reason why there were exactly six planets (per the state of knowledge at the time). Since there are exactly five regular solids, they corresponded one-to-one with the intervals between six orbits and so did give such a reason.
