Q:

When was 4D space "conceived of"?

In Measurement by Paul Lockhart
(Harvard Press),
he says (p.351):

the classical geometers (as far as I know) never even conceived
  of four-dimensional space, whereas adding another variable is
  an obvious and natural analytic extension.

Q. When was 4D space "conceived of"?

A:

According to Klein, the first mathematician who considered space-time as a 4-dimensional manifold was Lagrange, but these ideas were not immediately developed by others. Then he mentions Cauchy and Cayley (Cayley published in 1844 "Chapters on the analytic geometry in $n$ dimensions"), and credits Grassmann (1844) with the first systematic exposition.
While geometers discussed $4$ dimensions, people doing statistical
mechanics (Maxwell, Bolzmann and others) were inevitably lead to consideration
of $N$-dimensional manifolds where $N$ is of the order of Avogadro number.

A:

In his A First Course in Calculus Serge Lang mentions on pages 525-526 that d'Alembert wrote in an article on dimension in Diderot's Encyclop√©die in 1754 that "duration" could be considered a fourth dimension so the product of time by space has four dimensions, and that  whether or not this is useful it at least has the merit of being new.
The page here also mentions d'Alembert in 1754 and gives the year of Lagrange's work as 1797. If credit needs to be given to one person, it should be d'Alembert before Lagrange.
