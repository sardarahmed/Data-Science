Q:

Was $1+2+3+\cdots=-\frac{1}{12}$ in Ramanujan's letter?

In the letter Ramanujan wrote to Hardy did he say that $1+2+3+\cdots=-\frac{1}{12}$. I have been hearing this ridiculous statement for some time now. And now people say that Ramanujan wrote it. Is it true? 

A:

Ramanujan did write down the expression in his first notebook as shown here.  For a quick overview of this series, John Baez's lecture notes are a good starting point. These notes suggest that Ramanujan's observation goes back to Euler, though I have only seen the related alternating series $1 - 2 + 3 - 4 \dots = \frac{1}{4}$ mentioned in Euler's publications (see E352).

Here is the relevant text from Ramanujan's second letter to G. H. Hardy, dated 27 February 1913 :

Dear Sir, I am very much gratified on perusing your letter of the 8th February 1913. I was expecting a reply from you similar to the one which a Mathematics Professor at London wrote asking me to study carefully Bromwich's Infinite Series and not fall into the pitfalls of divergent series. … I told him that the sum of an infinite number of terms of the series: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + · · · = −1/12 under my theory. If I tell you this you will at once point out to me the lunatic asylum as my goal. I dilate on this simply to convince you that you will not be able to follow my methods of proof if I indicate the lines on which I proceed in a single letter. …
