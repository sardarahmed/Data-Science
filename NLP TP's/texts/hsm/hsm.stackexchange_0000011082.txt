Q:

Women in mathematics

I'd like to read something about the history of women in mathematics. I'd love to have reading suggestions of books in English or Italian, of 3 kinds:
1) History of math books, academic style;
2) Popular mathematics books, for a broader audience;
3) Books for young girls (8-11yo), possibly in Italian.
Thanks.

A:

Margaret Murray's "Women Becoming Mathematicians" (MIT Press) is great.
Also, Prof. Murray has a website with even more info:

(All in English.)

Ciao Alberto,
I do not know if you ever came across "Remembering Sophia Kovalevskaja" which is a quite curious book written by Michele Audin. It is not "popular" in that the math discussions in the book are at a very high level and it is not "academic" in that the way in which it is written is more towards literary style. A very interesting reading in my opinion.
Also Teri Perl wrote a couple of books popularizing figures of women mathematicians, quite some years ago. A colleague of mine has a very good opinion on this:
Math Equals , which I think is out of print now. But this is just a second hand comment.

Clara Viola, Donne matematiche. (Italian) [Women mathematicians] Matematiche Complementari, 3. Aracne Editrice, Rome, 2015. 83 pp. ISBN: 978-88-548-8037-5
My Italian is limited, but it seems that this collection of biographies of selected women mathematicians (including Maria Gaetana Agnesi and Sophie Germain, among others) is for readers older than 12 years. Still, it looks pretty accessible.
