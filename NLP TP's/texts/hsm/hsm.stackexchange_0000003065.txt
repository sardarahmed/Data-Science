Q:

In which ways has religion helped the progress of science?

I am writing a research paper on the interplay between science and religion, and need some examples of times when religion has benefited or inspired science and technology. 

A:

Geology -- the science of Geology was basically invented by the search for proof of the world-wide Noah's Flood as depicted in the book of Genesis chapter 6+.
This search by both religious (Christian) churchmen and laymen who had interests in science used their emergent knowledge of rocks, strata, and other features common to Geologic structures and artifacts to find evidence that there was a world-wide flood.  They believed that the earth would show evidence of flood geology.
During this process which took decades and was passed down from one generation of "flood scientists" to the next started to discover not only evidence of new geologic science but indications that the Earth was much older than they first thought and also that evidence proving a world-wide flood could not be found.
As a result of their work and the work of others in parallel discovery, the science of geology was born and matured to a point that it was totally separate from its early Flood Geology roots.
This entire story is told in a very excellent way by a book, "The Rocks Don't Lie -- A Geologist Investigates Noah's Flood" by David R. Montgomery, Professor of Earth and Space Sciences at University of Washington (Seattle).  I highly recommend the book.
I would like to point out that this is not an Anti-Christianity book nor does it use this history to defame Christianity.  It is a fair and balanced story of the history of the birth of Geology in this hunt for Noah's Flood.
