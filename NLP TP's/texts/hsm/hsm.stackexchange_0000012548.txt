Q:

After the invention of Boolean algebra, why did it take so long for the existential and universal quantifiers to become formalized into symbols?

Was there a specific reason that prevented researchers in Boolean algebra to invent such quantifiers in the flexible format that are known today earlier?
Since the compact symbols for multiplication and sum were all there, it's surprising that they weren't used immediately after Boole's invention in logic.

A:

This is likely to be for the same reason as to why arithmetic wasn't formalised until long after arithmetic was discovered: there was no point to it. Peano Arithmetic was formalised when the question of formalising the foundations of mathematics became a successful research direction, likewise with the propositional and predicate logical calculi once Boolean algebra showed how to formalise logic.
