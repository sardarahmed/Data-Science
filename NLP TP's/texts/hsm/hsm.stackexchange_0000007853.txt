Degenerate States in Quantum Mechanics

In his book on quantum mechanics in the chapter on perturbation theory Dirac says in a footnote: 

A system with only one stationary state belonging to each energy-level is often called non-degenerate and one with two or more stationary states belonging to an energy-level is called degenerate, although these words are not very appropriate from the modern point of view.

I have two questions about this:
1) Why did Dirac deem the terms (non-)degenerate inappropriate?
2) Why do we, with our even more modern point of view, still use them?

A:

Here is my interpretation of what Conifold’s unchronological comment may have been trying to say. The term “degeneracy” was first introduced by Schwarzschild (1916, p. 550) in the context of “old quantum theory”. (Credit by Sommerfeld (1921, p. 500).)
In (1927, p. 4) von Neumann “embedded quantum mechanics into Hilbert spaces” after participating in Hilbert’s 1926/27 seminar (and reading Dirac’s papers). Thereafter, degeneracy took the meaning of operator eigenvalue multiplicity, which is what Dirac must be referring to as “the modern point of view” in his book (1935 or 1947).
So Dirac may be objecting to the old QM word having been imported in this way — as opposed to using a “more appropriate” new one to mean “multiplicity > 1”. But no handy alternative emerged, so we still use degeneracy. (It would be interesting to see if similar uses in linear algebra, or algebraic geometry, pre- or post-date this episode.)
