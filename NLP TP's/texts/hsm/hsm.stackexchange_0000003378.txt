Q:

What were the applications of ellipses before elliptical orbits were discovered?

I'm interested in the history of ellipses. When were they discovered, what uses (if any) did they have before the true shape of orbits were found (by Kepler I think)?
There are some interesting ways to construct an ellipse. The common way is to anchor a string at the two focii and trace a circle with a pencil, but there is another way called a trammel of Archimedes that looks like it might be useful for something.
Did the ancients ever construct ellipses or ellipsoids for anything useful? Did they want to but were just too difficult to build?

A:

This question has been discussed on Math overflow:

This is about conic sections in general. In my answer I gave them as example
of "useless mathematics which became useful centuries later". Some tried to challenge this statement.
One of the conjectures mentioned that conic sections were discovered when the Greeks tried to develop a theory of sundials.
(Normally you get a hyperbola rather than ellipse, an ellipse will arise only in polar regions on the days when Sun never sets). This conjecture was much discussed in the history literature but on my opinion this is an unlikely explanation how conic sections were discovered. Another conjecture says that Menachem used conic sections for doubling the cube. This conjecture is nore plausible. See the references in the link above. 
EDIT. There is of course a well-known legend about Archimedes burning Roman ships with parabolic mirrors, and it is clear that this is only a legend: no serious scientist believes that this can be actually performed. (But you can see this in the movies).
