Q:

What results for $1 + 2 + 3 + ...$ are known?

Euler obtained the famous result $1+2+3+...= -1/12$. Is this the only result for $\Sigma_{n=0}^{\infty}n$ or have other results been derived, for instance in set theory?

A:

First let me explain that Euler in fact obtained this result since some comments to the original question seem to doubt that.
Leonhard Euler applied the $\zeta$ series to obtain the result, $\zeta(-1) = -1/12$ but he knew that summation of divergent series is doubtful, namely "the cause of great dissent among mathematicians of whom some deny and others affirm that such a sum can be found." See Ed Sandifer: How Euler did it. http://eulerarchive.maa.org/hedi/HEDI-2006-06.pdf
In fact Euler applied the series where it does not converge at all and hence does not converge to $-1/12$ either. But at his times a lot of undigested math was en vogue. So he assumed with Leibniz and the Bernoullis that $1-1+1-1+1-+... = 1/2$ and with Wallis that $1/3 < 1/2 < 1/1 < 1/0 < 1/-1$. All that is wrong. Obviously $1+2+3+...> 1$. And if something else is meant by "$+$", then it should be clearly indicated. Unfortunately Ramanujan and many modern mathematicians accept this confusing notation. On the other hand, Euler has obtained correct results from wrong assumptions like $ log2\infty - log\infty= log2 $ or $(1 + x/\infty)^\infty = e^x$.
Bernard Bolzano in his Paradoxien des Unendlichen, p. 44f denotes the sum of all natural numbers by $S^0$. Further he introduces $N^0$ what we would call the cardinal number today, taking one unit for every natural number. He claims that some (without quoting names) have put $N^0(N^0+1)/2 = S^0$. But he does not endorse this result. He only claims that the sum $S^0$ must be by far larger than $N^0$. If I remember correctly, Euler somewhere wrote $i(i+1)/2$ with $i$ for numerus infinitus as he often did. But I am not sure.
Cantor summed all natural numbers with the result $ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... \nu... = \omega$ in a letter of 1883 to Mittag Leffler (i.e., before he had introduced cardinal numbers). He obtained the same sum for the harmonic series. He emphasized however the order of the terms: $2 + 3 + ... + \nu+ ... + 1 = \omega + 1$. Whether $2$ is necessary as first term of the sequence is left open but obviously it is not necessary. For another order he states $1 + 3 + 5 +  ... + (2\nu + 1) + ... + 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + (2\nu) + ... = 2\omega$
