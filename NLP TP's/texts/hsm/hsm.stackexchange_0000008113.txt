Q:

Original paper of Gauss on his method of quadrature

I tried to find Gauss's original paper on his method of quadrature, but in vain. Is it translated into English? 
How about Legendre's paper? 

A:

You can find a link to Gauss' 1815 paper on numerical quadrature, ``Methodus nova integralium valores per approximationem inveniendi'' here.  I'm not aware of any translation of it into English.
