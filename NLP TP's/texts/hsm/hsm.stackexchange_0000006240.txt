First appearance of Hadamard's lemma on smooth functions

Hadamard's lemma, in one dimension, says for any smooth function $f \colon \mathbf R \rightarrow \mathbf R$ there is a first-order expansion of $f$ at $0$: $f(x) = f(0) + xg(x)$ where $g \colon \mathbf R \rightarrow \mathbf R$ is smooth. Explicitly, $g(x) = \int_0^1 f'(tx)\,dt$. (The analogue in higher dimensions is on the Wikipedia page for Hadamard's lemma.) 
My question is: where/when did Hadamard first present this result, or is it not due to him at all (Stigler's law)? 
I looked through the four volumes of Hadamard's Oeuvres and the only thing I could find resembling this result was in his 1892 PhD thesis on analytic functions. Sections 32-35 contain some integrals of the form $\int_0^1 V(t)f(tx)\,dt$ for different choices of $V(t)$.  Perhaps these motivated someone else (Whitney?) later on when the general foundations of manifolds were laid down in the 20th century.

The reference to the book on wave propagation (Leçons sur la propagation des ondes et les équations de l'hydrodynamique. Cours du collège de France, Hermann, 1903) 
available at https://archive.org/details/leonssurlaprop00hada/page/n12 
indeed contains this lemma in the Note I, on p. 352, under the form:
if $ p \in \mathbb{N}^* $ and $ F \in \mathcal{C}^p (\mathbb{R}^d) $, then there exist $ \varphi_1 , \dotsc , \varphi_d \in \mathcal{C}^{p-1} (\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d ) $ such that for every $(x_1, \dotsc , x_d )$, $( y_1 , \dotsc , y_d ) \in \mathbb{R}^d $, we have
$$
 F( x_1 , \dotsc , x_d ) - F( y_1 , \dotsc , y_d ) 
 = \sum_{j=1}^d (x_j - y_j ) \varphi_j ( x_1 , \dotsc , x_d , y_1 , \dotsc , y_d ) .
$$
For the proof, J. Hadamard claims that for $ d =1 $, it is "easy to verify" that 
$ (x,y) \mapsto \frac{F(x)-F(y)}{x-y} $ is of class $ \mathcal{C}^{p-1} (\mathbb{R}) $ when $ F \in \mathcal{C}^p (\mathbb{R}) $, and deduce the general case by writing
\begin{align*}
 F( x_1 , \dotsc , x_d ) - F( y_1 , \dotsc , y_d ) 
 & = [ F( x_1 , x_2 , \dotsc , x_d ) - F( y_1 , x_2 , \dotsc , x_d ) ] 
 \\
 & \quad + [ F( y_1, x_2 , \dotsc , x_d ) - F( y_1 , y_2 , x_3 , \dotsc , x_d ) ] 
 \\
 & \quad + \dotsc + [ F( y_1, y_2 , \dotsc , y_{d-1} , x_d ) - F( y_1 , y_2 , \dotsc , y_{d-1} , y_d ) ] .
\end{align*}
