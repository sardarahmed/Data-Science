Q:

A book on Emmy Noether's life

I am looking for a good book on Noether's life. Not only a biography, but a book that also explains her life's work to a general, somewhat mathematically mature audience. If such a book is not available, then a book aimed at graduate students would be the next best thing.

A:

Emmy Noether's Wonderful Theorem by Dwight E. Neuenschwander.
The title says it all: the book explains Noether's theorem in detail. Everything is derived and explained from scratch: the action principle, symmetries, Lagrangians, Hamiltonians,... The style very reader-friendly, it is not a textbook. However, the book is only meant for those who have enough mathematical background (in particular maths and physics undergrads). The introduction contains a short (4-page) biography.
