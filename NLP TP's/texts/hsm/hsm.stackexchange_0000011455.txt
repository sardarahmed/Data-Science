Q:

Dénes Kőnig vs. König's Lemma

In Hungarian you spell the surname of Dénes Kőnig with a double acute accent, whereas Lemma von König is written in German with an umlaut.  Why the difference? Is the reason behind it purely typographical or is there something deeper?
In particular, if you write a German text, which variants do you use nowadays: Dénes Kőnig and Lemma von König or something else?

A:

"ő" exists in Hungarian, it is pronounced as a longer "ö" (and "ö" is pronounced like the first vowel in the English word "dirty"). But in German, only "ö" exists (and it depends on the actual dialect/context, how long is it pronounced).
"König" is originally a German word, and it means "King". His name has German origin, already the "Kőnig" version was a Hungarianized form (it sounds simply more natural for native speakers).
While in the region and the era was/is it common to use some simplification/translation of the names, mostly to adapt better foreign-speaker environments, he and his father lived their entire life in Hungary and they did not need to do that.
The probable reason today to use the "ö"-Form is that "ö" exists in the most common extension of the ascii encoding (so-named "latin1"), but "ő" does not. Another probable reason was that the typewriters and pre-unicode computers of the era could write "ö" far more easily.
In a German text I would use the "ö"-version on decency reason.
Both the English and the German Wikipedia use the Kőnig name.
