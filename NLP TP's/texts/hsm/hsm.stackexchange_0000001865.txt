Q:

Who was the first to calculate $\pi$?

I am very interested in the history of $\pi$. I am first trying to find out who calculated it. Many sources have different answers, from the ancient Egyptians, to Archimedes, to the Babylonians. I still can't find an answer to who first discovered $\pi$, or found a way to calculate it to any degree of accuracy. So who, or which group of people, were the first one(s) to discover/calculate $\pi$?

A:

It depends on the meaning of "calculate", since $\pi$ is a transcendental number it can not be "calculated" in the usual meaning of the word. 
The first analytic formula (in the form of an infinite series) that in principle can calculate $\pi$ to any required accuracy is probably due to medieval Indian mathematician Madhava, who was first to conceive of infinite series explicitly, or one of his successors. In Europe this series was rediscovered by Leibniz, and is usually called Leibniz series in Western literature.
A semi-geometric "calculation" procedure capable in principle of producing arbitrary accuracy is much older. It consists of approximating a circle by inscribed and circumscribed polygons, and can be traced to ancient Greek orator Antiphon the Sophist. This method was mathematically justified by Eudoxus of Cnidus using what is now called method of exhaustion, and his justification is presented in Book XII of Euclid's Elements. Archimedes perfected the method in On the Measurement of the Circle. He proved rigorously that the ratio of the circle to the square on its radius was the same as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, so it could be computed both ways. 
Approximating the circumference with polygon perimeters is much simpler than approximating the circle area with polygon areas as Antiphon suggested. Using $96$-gons, Archimedes obtained what is now presented as the double estimate $3\frac{10}{71}<\pi<3\frac17$, although to Archimedes $\pi$ was not a number, and the result was phrased geometrically in terms of ratios of magnitudes. In 17th century Huygens refined the method further, and obtained the most accurate estimates to date, but after that analytic methods became more effective. 
However, ancient Greeks also had a different concept of calculation, a purely geometric one, that was dominant in their time. A geometric magnitude was considered "calculated" if one could give a geometric construction for it. In the case of $\pi$ this meant constructing a square with area equal to the area of a given circle (or, after Archimedes, a segment with the length equal to half the circle's circumference). With straightedge and compass this is impossible (but it was only shown by Lindeman in 19th century), but Greeks also entertained more broad notions of "construction". 
In this broader sense, the circle was first squared by Dinostratus around 350 BC using a curve, now known as the quadratrix. The curve itself was invented a century earlier by Hippias, who generated it by combining uniform linear and circular motions, and used it for angle trisection. In modern terms, from a segment of length $1$ it produces ("calculates") a segment of length $2/\pi$, and from that it is a simple matter to get a segment of length $\pi$ with straightedge and compass. Later Archimedes "calculated" $\pi$ in the same spirit using another curve generated by uniform linear and circular motions, the Archimedean spiral.

What do you mean "correctly or not"?
Here is a brief history. The Bible has a sentence which can be interpreted as implying that $\pi=3$.
The EXISTENCE of $\pi$ (the ratio of circumference to diameter) was rigorously proved by Archimedes. He also calculated it approximately.
For many centuries it was called the "Archimedes number".
As centuries passed, they calculated it with larger and larger precision. Today it is known
to more than a billion decimal digits and more. In 1990-th there was an interesting article in New Yorker magazine about the brothers Chudnovskii who evaluated the first billion digits. (With a huge computer they specially assembled for this purpose).
$\pi$ is a transcendental number, so you cannot "evaluate" it exactly (there is no finite or periodic decimal (or other) expression). This was proved by Lindemann in 1882.
Remark.
Let me also add that there was a crank in 19-th century who "proved" that $\pi=4$.
I think this is recorded in the Guinness book of records as the LEAST precise value of $\pi$ ever proposed. He offered his work as a gift to the State of Indiana. Indiana parliament had to
decide whether to accept the gift. They could not decide. The decision was postponed.
It is still postponed.
This gives some evil (or not informed) people a reason to say that "Indiana parliament
LEGISLATED that $\pi=4$". Don't believe these people.
EDIT: My mistake: certainly "existence of $\pi$" was known to Euclid. Conifold: thanks for the correction. To address the same remark of Conifold: Euclid and Archimedes (and possibly Eudoxus) certainly understood perfectly what is a "real number" though they used somewhat different terminology of "proportions". Theory of proportions of Euclid is equivalent to the theory of real numbers.

Since the question specifically says "to any accuracy," I will assume you mean approximations as well.
In this case, the first recorded approximation of $\pi$ comes from the Babylonians, who not only had an awareness of it as being a specific constant, had approximated it's value to $3\frac{1}{8}$ or $3.125$. This is recorded in a tablet fond near Susa dating from 2000 BC.
Both the Egyptians and Archimedes had a value for it but these date from much later.
From the Rhind Papyrus dating from around 1650 BC we find an Egyptian's scribe method for obtaining the area of a circle which is equivalent to using the value  $\pi = 3\frac{1}{6}$ or $3.166$ repeating. This is perhaps nearly as good as the Babylonian approximation, but the Egyptians did not apparently have an awareness of it as being a specific constant, this is merely the effective value of it arising from their method.
From Archimedes there is given an approximation of $\pi$ more accurate than either the Egyptian or Babylonian, but this dates from almost 2000 years after the recorded Babylonian value.
