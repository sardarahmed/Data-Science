Q:

Different models for the development of mathematics: Latin versus butterfly

Ian Hacking's 2014 book *Why is there philosophy of mathematics at all?", see here, contains many interesting ideas.  One of the ideas is the dichotomy of two distinct models for the development of a science. One is the butterfy model. A biological organism follows a course of development that is predetermined to a certain extent by its genetic make-up. The example of butterfly was chosen I think because of the dramatic changes a butterfly undergoes (cocoon, etc), unlike, say, an elephant; yet even those dramatic changes are written into the script so to speak.
The other model is the Latin model of development of a natural language like Latin. Such development obviously is affected by historical factors and contingencies of human behavior.
Hacking seems to think that scholars often view mathematics as following a butterfly model, whereas he himself seems to argue in favor of the Latin model.
So to summarize, my question is: does Hacking's Latin model really apply to mathematics?

A:

Mathematics is a language (and a culture), as such it isn't constrained by any "predetermined path" mandated by some genome makeup. I'd strongly say mathematics (and all science, as part of human culture) follows the "Latin" scheme (which itself is also part of the same cultural development).
