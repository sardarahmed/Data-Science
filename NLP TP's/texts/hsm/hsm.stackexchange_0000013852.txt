Q:

What set of criteria led Hamilton to discover the quaternions?

Frobenius's theorem states that the only finite-dimensional, associative division algebras over $\mathbb R$ are: $\mathbb R, \mathbb C, \mathbb H$ (where the last of these are the quaternions). So one might be led to think that:

Hamilton discovered the notion of a finite-dimensional unital algebra over $\mathbb R$. These things are sometimes called hypercomplex number systems.

Hamilton discovered that some of these algebras are associative, and some are not.

Hamilton discovered that some algebras are division algebras, while most are not.

Putting these together, Hamilton might have set about to find a larger finite-dimensional, associative, division algebra than $\mathbb C$, and eventually arrived at $\mathbb H$. This would be quite impressive as I think that the above three notions did not get studied until after Hamilton presented the quaternions as the first non-trivial hypercomplex number system.
You see, some explanation is badly needed for why Hamilton dismissed straightforward generalisations of $\mathbb C$ like $\mathbb C \oplus \mathbb R$ in his project to generalise $\mathbb C$, and instead settled on a non-commutative 4-dimensional algebra whose defining relation is the arguably cryptic $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$. What criteria was he looking to satisfy?
PS: A bonus question would be to explain how Gauss independently discovered the quaternions. Should this be asked as a separate question?

When I have time later I might return to this and try to provide additional exposition directly addressing your question, maybe quote something relevant from Crowe's A History of Vector Analysis (a book I've been reading the past 2 months; I'm now a little more than half-way through it). However, for now I thought it would be useful to provide some older books (and a couple of papers by Hamilton) to look at. As for the books, besides glancing through their table of contents, reading their prefaces, etc., I also recommend reading reviews of these books, which are easy to find by googling the author's last name and the book's title in google-books (date-restrict from the publication date to about 5 years later). I’ve included links to the book reviews I know about.
Every link below is freely available on the internet, at least where I am. Probably all of the books are also freely available online at the Internet Archive (easiest way: google the book's title, maybe author's last name if the title is fairly generic, along with the "word" archive.org), but probably not all of the reviews can be found elsewhere online (freely or otherwise). If you really want to dive into the older literature on quaternions, you’ll want to make use of Macfarlane’s Bibliography of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics (1904).

A:

In the paper Hamilton's Discovery of Quaternions by B. L. VAN DER WAERDEN, the author lists the criteria Hamilton was looking to satisfy from his algebra:

They must define a finite-dimensional unital algebra over $\mathbb R$. This led him to adopt the notation $a + bi + cj$ for the elements of such an algebra.
Assume a hypothetical 3-dimensional number system where the numbers are of the form $z = a + bi + cj$. Hamilton defined $|z|$ to be $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$ by generalising the same operation over the complex numbers. He wanted this operation to satisfy the identity $|wz| = |w| |z|$.

The combination of these criteria define precisely the normed unital algebras. By Hurwitz's theorem, the only algebras satisfying these criteria are $\mathbb R, \mathbb C, \mathbb H, \mathbb O$, where the last symbol denotes the octonions.
