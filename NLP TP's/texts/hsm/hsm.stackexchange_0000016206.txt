Q:

Did Rafael Bombelli write any commentary about his rules for arithmetic involving negative numbers?

Rafael Bombelli was the first European mathematician to write about the laws of arithmetic for negative numbers.
On Wikipedia I read that he wrote:
“Minus 5 times minus 6 makes plus 30”.
I also read that Bombelli was interested in cubic equations and developed laws of arithmetic with imaginary numbers.
My question is that the laws of arithmetic he produced for imaginary numbers have commentaries and are generated by applying existing mathematical properties such as distribution over multiplication to equate whole number answers to cubic equations, which do not uphold to Cardano's general formula.
I was wondering if his laws for arithmetic with negatives arose in the same fashion.
If there is anywhere I can read about the subsequent progression of arithmetic with negative and imaginary numbers and how their acceptances were somewhat intertwined and “artificial” it would be appreciated.

A:

Leo Corry's recent text, A Brief History of Numbers, offers an authoritative account of these matters.
According to Corry, Bombelli's attitude to negative numbers was the same as Cardano's. Bombelli would not have written "Minus 5 times minus 6 makes plus 30”, as wikipedia suggests.  Rather, Bombelli would have written "Subtract 5 times subtract 6 makes 30."  Furthermore, Corry states that the law of signs for multiplication was established by the abacists and rejected by Cardano.  What Corry gives Bombelli credit for is extending the law of signs to imaginary numbers.

What Bombelli did in his book [Algebra] was to extend to the case of square roots of negative numbers (with the help of some new terminology) the abacist rules for the arithmetic of binomials. ... Using this nomenclature, he wrote down correctly all the rules of sign multiplication with numbers of this kind.
