Q:

When did mechanical tower clocks start being used?

On a tour of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich I saw the following display on the history of mechanical clocks:

The suggest that mechanical clocks and astronomy werenâ€™t really combined in England until the 16th century. 
Now I thought mechanical clocks came into use in the 13th century. 
My question is: When did mechanical tower clocks start being used?

A:

In 14th century, but it is not known precisely, where and when was the first clock made. Salisbury cathedral has on display something they call the "oldest surviving clock", made in 1386. But similar claims are made about some French and Italian cocks for which they give earlier dates.

This is about mechanical (weight-driven) clocks. Water clocks are much older,
exist since antiquity, and there were also some large and complicated water clocks in China.
