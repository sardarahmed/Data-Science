Q:

When were mental disorders first recognized as diseases?

I want to know if, any old civilizations have considered mental disorders as real disease which could be cured? If not, then where it got this status in modern science?

A:

For what I know, ancient civilisations did consider mental disorders as a disease. **Hyppocrates (around 400 BC) ** recomended a change in the environment of mentaly-ill persons, giving the diseases a cause - the environment - and a cure.
Modern mental health treatment can be tracked back from 15th century with the first european facility for mental health treatment opening in Valencia, Spain. Treatment for the patient and protection for and from the rest of the world remain linked today in many cases, but focus on one or the other of the activities has been shifting ever since.
