Q:

Nobel Prize work derived from Manhattan Project research?

There are quite a few Nobel Prize winners (e.g. Physics) who worked on the Manhattan project in the development of the atomic bomb.  But, did any Nobel Prize result from direct research performed on the Manhattan Project?  For example, although Feynman was a key participant in the Manhattan project, his Nobel did not derive from work specific to the development of the bomb.  But, are their other Nobel Prize winners in Physics (or, Chemistry) whose work can be considered a descendent of work performed in support of the work on the atomic bomb?

A:

Seaborg received a Chemistry Nobel in 1951 for exploring the chemistry of transuranic elements.  That presumably would include his work with Plutonium during the Manhattan project.  
I'm pretty sure that's the only one (and it admittedly only sort of counts).  Most of the scientific discoveries necessary for the bomb were done in the late 30's.  The Manhattan project itself was mainly concerned with the resulting engineering problems.
