Q:

Are there any accounts of famous Mathematicians/Scientists and their dogs, or any pets in general?

I know this is probably a precise and odd question, but I'm curious to know if any famous Mathematicians or Scientist had pets. I'm really looking for Mathematicians and dogs but I thought it better to widen my search. 

A:

F. D. C. Willard co-authored a paper with Jack Hetherington. Willard was his cat.
