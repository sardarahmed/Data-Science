Q:

Were Julia sets discovered before the Mandelbrot set?

The Mandelbrot set was discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980.
However, Gaston Julia lived from 1893 to 1978.
Does this mean Julia sets, in the popular form we know them today, were discovered before the famous Mandelbrot fractal?

A:

Yes, about 60 years before.
What is called "Julia set" was actually discovered by P. Fatou, his first publication on the subject is from 1917:
Sur les substitutions rationnelles,
Comptes Rendus, 164, 806-808 (1917).
Julia's paper on the subject was published in 1918,
but he was able to prove that he discovered it independently of Fatou.
It was called "irregular set" until, after the death of Fatou,
Julia insisted that it must be called Julia set.

Mandelbrot set was discovered by Brooks and Matelski in 1978 (but their paper was published in 1981):
The dynamics of 2-generator subgroups of PSL(2,C). Riemann surfaces and related topics: Proceedings of the 1978 Stony Brook Conference (State Univ. New York, Stony Brook, N.Y., 1978), pp. 65â€“71, Ann. of Math. Stud., No. 97, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, NJ, 1981.
The contribution of Mandelbrot consists in production of high-tech computer pictures of it.
His paper was published in 1980, it contains a good quality picture, but this first picture is not quite correct.
