Q:

What is Bertrand Russell citing Gilman for in "On the Notion of Order"?

In the first few pages of "On the Notion of Order", Bertrand Russell has the footnote:

The following account of the genesis of order is virtually identical with that of Mr. B. I. Gilman, Mind, N. S., vol. i.

I thought just putting this into Google would suffice, but somehow I got lots of results that are far too recent to be attributed in something published circa 1901.
What work is Bertrand Russell actually citing here?

A:

In Mind, N. S. Vol. $\rm I$ (p. $519$), there is On The Properties of a One-Dimensional Manifold by B. I. Gilman.
Russell was citing this work, if I am not wrong.
