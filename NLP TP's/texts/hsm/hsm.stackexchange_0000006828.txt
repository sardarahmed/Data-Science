Q:

Biographies comparing the personal and professional lives of various influential scientists/mathematicians?

There are many biographies that go into detail into the lives of a single, or maybe a couple of scientists. 
I am wondering, is there a good book that does not focus on an individual, but explicitly takes theses individuals as examples, of the "typical" scientist, or looks at the various types of scientists? 

A:

Not sure these exactly fit your needs, but I am reminded of:
