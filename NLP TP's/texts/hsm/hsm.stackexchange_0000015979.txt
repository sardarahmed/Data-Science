Q:

Implications of several unpublished "binomial congruences" of Gauss

In article 23 of his first memoir on biquadratic residues, Gauss gave the first example of a binomial-type congruence, which is apparently a quite "deep" result - many authors relate it to the theory of integral points on certain elliptic curves. His result is stated as follows: if $p=4n+1$ is a prime, then $p=a^2+b^2$ for some integers $a,b$ (this is Fermat's two squares theorem). Gauss showed that if $a$ is fixed by $a\equiv 1 \pmod{4} $ then
$$2a\equiv{2n \choose n}\pmod {p}$$ or $2a\equiv{\frac{p-1}{2} \choose \frac{p-1}{4}}\pmod {p}$.
In his treatise on Gauss's number theoretic investigations, Paul Bachmann remarks that other isolated theorems of this kind were also known to Gauss, and refers to p. 39 of volume 10-1 of his collected works. Looking there, I found the following statements of Gauss:

If $p=3n+1=x^2+3y^2$ is a prime number, then $$2x\equiv {\frac{p-1}{2}\choose \frac{p-1}{6}} \pmod {p}$$ Under the same condition, if $4p=l^2+27m^2$ then $$l\equiv - {\frac{2(p-1)}{3}\choose \frac{p-1}{3}}\pmod{p}.$$ If a prime number is $p=8n+1 = a^2+2b^2,$  then $$2a\equiv {\frac{p-1}{2}\choose \frac{p-1}{8}} \pmod {p},$$ and
if $p=8n+3=a^2+2b^2$ then $$2a \equiv
> {\frac{p-1}{2}\choose\frac{p-3}{8}} \pmod {p}$$

While his published binomial congruence is quite referenced in the literature (it is often refered to as the "classical" example of such congruences), I have not found discussions of the unpublished results from his Nachlass. Are these unpublished congruences not discussed just because they are based on similar principles as his published one? and are their derivations of similar complexity? whatever the answer is, I would like to know on what principles they rest (but only in general terms, as I am not a mathematician and right now I cannot read into the details).
Any useful comments/references will be appreciated!

A:

I have seen papers and books on Gauss and Jacobi sums discuss such results, e.g., see https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82122545.pdf.
The book "Gauss and Jacobi sums" by Berndt, Evans, and Williams has some results like this too: see page 2 in the introduction and look up "binomial coefficients" in the index. They also related use the Gross-Koblitz formula for $p$-adic Gauss sums to improve some congruences to modulus $p^2$.
Congruences like this appear in some exercises in Ireland & Rosen's A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory 2nd ed. (exer. 27 in Chapter 8, exer. 39 & 40 in Chapter 9)
