Q:

Where did the naming structure of particles come from (suffix -on)?

I was looking at a list of particles, and I noticed that many of them ended in -on.  Proton, electron, neutron, lepton, etc. Is there a historical (or linguistic) reason behind this naming structure?

A:

This is a question about etymology. It all started with the genuine Greek words anion “going up” and kation “going down”, both neuter participles of the verb “to go” with different preverbs: an(a)- and kat(a)-. Then we got “ion” on its own as a term encompassing both, and then, by analogy, “proton”, “electron”, “neutron”, and ultimately also “positron” (based on a spurious reanalysis of electr-on as elect-ron, and creation of a pseudo-suffix “ron”.)
