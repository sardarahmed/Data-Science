Q:

Quote from ancient scholar: that a leader cannot be neutral, he must chose a side

An ancient scholar said a leader cannot be neutral, that he must chose a side or he will be viewed as an enemy by both sides. 
I am trying to find who said/wrote that. Anyone know? 
Thanks.

The answer appears to be "everyone."  First hit included:
“The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality.” 
― Dante Alighieri
“If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.” 
― Desmond Tutu (Foreword)
“Neutrality wears upon it the bias dress, whether direct or indirect way since no one shows and proves naturally or habitually, to be a natural. It demonstrates a legal, virtuous and impeccable idiocy.” 
― Ehsan Sehgal
