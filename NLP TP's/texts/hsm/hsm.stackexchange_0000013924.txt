Q:

Hamiltonian $H$ named after Huygens?

This seems an unlikely origin of the abbreviation $H$ for Hamiltonian. Is there evidence for this nomenclature?

A:

This seems to be the original source of the claim: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-06248-8_25
A relevant quote:

nowhere does Lagrange say explicitly that
he uses the letter H to honor Huygens, but there is overwhelming circumstantial
evidence that was his intention

The main argument seems to rely on two observations:

Lagrange uses the equation $T + V = H$ in his book MÃ©canique
Analytique written before Hamilton worked on mechanics.
In the book Lagrange attributes the principle of conservation of live forces to Huygens.
