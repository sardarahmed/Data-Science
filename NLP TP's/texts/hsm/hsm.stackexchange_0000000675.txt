Q:

What's the origin and meaning of the adjective "free" in mathematics?

It's pretty common to call a group, ring or module free when it has a 'basis', but unlike other mathematical definitions whose names can be easily related to the concept they describe (e.g. the spectrum of an operator), the name free hardly tells me anything intuitively about the object itself. So, the questions are:
What's the origin of this terminology?
Is there any hint on what the original motivation was?

A:

"Free" usually means "free of relations", "independent".
For example, a free group is the set of all words in a given alphabet
$$a, a^{-1}, b, b^{-1}, c, c^{-1}\ldots .$$
The group operation is concatenation of words, with cancellation of $xx^{-1}$ and $x^{-1}x$.
the neutral element is the empty word.
Every finitely generated group can be presented in a similar way but with certain "relations" that is several words which are equal to the neutral word by definition.
Then we have a homeomorphism from the free group to any other group generated by the same
alphabet. This situation can be formalized in terms of category theory, and in any category
a "free object" can be defined using the appropriate morphism diagram.
