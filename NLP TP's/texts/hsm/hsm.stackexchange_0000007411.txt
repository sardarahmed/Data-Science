Q:

What field will we be remembered for developing?

I had a course on History of Mathematics this semester and it seemed that each civilization became known for developing a particular area of mathematics. For example, Arithmetic and Ancient Egypt/Babylonia, Geometry and Ancient Greece, Algebra and Islam, Analysis and northern Europe, etc.
 Is this the case at all, were those areas really more researched, or do we associate one with the other because it was the first time it was studied? If the former is true, what area/areas of mathematics do you think we'll be remembered for developing?

A:

Once I've heard a lecture of David Kazhdan (a very prominent mathematician), who said the following:
"18th century was the century of Analysis, 19th century was a century of group theory, and 20th century was the century of cohomology".
I disagree with this, but just wanted to communicate his opinion.
(In general I think that such statements are meaningless. There was SOME geometry
in Egypt and Babylon, and very much arithmetic in the Ancient Greece, and it is somewhat questionable which civilization invented algebra, except the name. And so on.
Of course Kazhdan's statement is even more open to crriticism).
