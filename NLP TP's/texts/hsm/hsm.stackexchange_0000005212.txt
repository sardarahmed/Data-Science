Q:

What are the precursors and postcursors to discovery/invention of zero?

There are several instances in history that are considered to be good candidates as discovery and first use of zero. Examples includes Ancient Sumarian and Babylonian civilizations, Mayans, medieval India, China and Cambodia.
What are the mathematical concepts and ideas that can be logically considered as precursors to discovery of zero. For example, familiarity and extensive  use of a positional number system within a civilization could be considered as one such precursor. Another is evidence of experimenting with different symbols like empty space, dot, etc. to indicate absence of a number and need to deal with relatively large numbers.
Similarly what are the ideas that can be anticipated to follow discovery of zero?
Here are some examples: negative numbers, new rules of arithmetic to handle zero and negative numbers in addition to natural numbers, etc.

A:

The main role of zero is not to express "nothing", but to serve as a place holder
in a positional system. The need in a place holder begins when people start
comlicated calculations, that is in Babylonian astronomy. First they used a space
instead of zero, then invented a secial cuneiform sign (which I cannot reproduce here), see Van-der-Waerden, Science Awakening.
Greeks used letter notation for numbers, but they also needed zero. Ptolemy uses
the Greek letter $\omicron$ (omicron).
Thus for example the number written in modern sexagesimal notation as
373; 10,0,58 (which means 373 degrees 10 minutes 0 seconds and 58/60 of a second) in Ptolemy would look like this: 
$$\overline{\tau\omicron\gamma}\;\overline{\iota}\; \omicron\; \overline{\nu\eta}$$
Horisontal overline is used to show that letters under it are digits of one number. Here $\tau$ is 300, $\gamma$ is 3, $\iota$ is 10, $\nu$ is 50 and
$\eta$ is 8. The $\omicron$ has a double meaning here: overlined it stands for the 70
in 373, and not overlined for zero.
The only difference with modern notation is that Ptolemy used decimal systems
for the integer part and sexagesimal for the fractional part. But "zero" he had. 
Van der Waerden writes that the use of the letter $\omicron$ to denote zero
was known to some Iamblichus, a Pythagorean, but this cannot be the Iamblichus
of Wikipedia (245-345, a Syrian philosopher) because he lived after Ptolemy,
and van der Waerden is well aware that Ptolemy used $\omicron$ as zero.
As Indians and Arabs knew Ptolemy, crediting them with "invention of zero" is an
exaggeration. But of course they perfected the positional system.
