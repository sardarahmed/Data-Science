Q:

When did we first learn that Jupiter was a gas giant?

The term "gas giant" was invented in the 1950s, but I think the concept has been known longer than that.
When did we first learn that Jupiter was a gas giant, not a terrestrial-type planet?

A:

We need to clear one thing up here, and that is the definition of a gas giant. As an example, take Wikipedia's definition:

A gas giant is a giant planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium.

All we have to do to classify Jupiter as a gas giant is to prove that it's made of . . . gas.
The answer leads to Giovanni Cassini, who observed Jupiter's differential rotation in the 1690s, thus showing that it could not be solid.
