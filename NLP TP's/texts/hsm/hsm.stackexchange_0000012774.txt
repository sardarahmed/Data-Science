Q:

Story of a student who solves an open problem

A number of years ago, I read a (non-fiction) story about a young mathematician whose professor wrote an open problem on the board and the student went ahead and wrote down a solution after a moment of thought. The writer goes on to say something like

From that moment on, I was afraid of [this student].

I think the article mentioned that, when asked questions in class, many students would offer ideas without thought but that this particular student would think quietly before saying what was correct. Would someone know where this story can be found, probably in an article, and who the student was? I would like to say that the student was a young Grothendieck but my Google searches in that direction were fruitless.

A:

That's John von Neumann, about whom George Pólya wrote:

There was a seminar for advanced students in Zürich that I was teaching and von Neumann was in the class. I came to a certain theorem, and I said it is not proved and it may be difficult. Von Neumann didn’t say anything but after five minutes he raised his hand. When I called on him he went to the blackboard and proceeded to write down the proof. After that I was afraid of von Neumann.

Edit: I have confirmed that the passage above can be found at The Pólya picture album, edited by G. L. Alexanderson (Birkhäuser, 1987, p. 154). The sentences quoted above are part of the caption of a picture of von Neumann and Abraham Taub, which begins with:

This is my only picture of von Neumann. He is the only student of mine I was ever intimidated by. He was so quick.
