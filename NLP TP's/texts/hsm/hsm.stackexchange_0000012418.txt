Q:

Differences between modern and old mathematical notations

Note: I didn't write the word "ancient" in the title because I want to see the notation from 1400 A.D. to 1700 A.D.
Mathematical notation has changed very much from the past millennium, and new notations are made for new concepts. For example, there was a time when the notations for representing numbers was different in different regions. I saw somewhere a piece of a page from one of Euler's books or articles:

This is very close to modern notation, but not same as it (for example, the root symbols are larger). After seeing this page, a question cam in my mind:

What are some major differences in today's notation and notation of 1400 A.D. to 1700 A.D. era?

These differences are to be mentioned:

Differences in symbols representing numbers, for example, somewhere in an old article (probably of Euler's) the number $1$ was written as $I$ (I thought that it was roman, but 2 was written normally)
Major differences in "minor notations". For example, while reading Ramanujan's handwritten manuscripts, I found that He wrote $\&c$ instead of the normal $\dots$ in infinite sum. He would have written:
$$\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\&c$$
instead of:
$$\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\dots$$
Differences in the "texture" of the symbols. For example, in the image I have given above, it can be noticed that the integral symbols and the root symbols are a little bit different.
Differences in terminology. Many examples are in the first answer, and I think there are very few that he didn't mention. If there are any more, please also mention them.

Like most big list questions, please mention only one difference per answer. If I missed any other difference in symbols case, please mention in the comments or edit the question.

I. Notes on notation and English terms in 1800s literature (primarily related to series)
The following is from the introductory comments for something involving conditionally convergent series I was working on several years ago.

The logarithm function is often denoted by a lower case L, sometimes italicized (e.g. Catalan's book) and sometimes not italicized (e.g. Laurent's book). Incidentally, this leads to many instances of ln appearing, but these denote the logarithm of $n$ rather than the often now used logarithm function ${\ln}.$ Iterated logarithms were denoted either by consecutive L's or the use of superscripts (e.g. $\ln \ln \ln n$ might be denoted by llln or lll n or ${l^3}n,$ or by similar expressions in which the lower case L is NOT italicized).

$n!$ (factorial) was often denoted by placing $n$ within a "partial box" formed by using only the left and bottom sides of a rectangular box. Anytime you are unsure how factorials are denoted in a book, simply look in places where power series expansions of exponential and trigonometric functions appear. However, most of the time a "factorial notation" was not used, and instead the first few terms (and the general term, if not obvious) were written.

Multiplication was often denoted by a period (easier to typeset than our current centered dot notation), and thus the expression $1.2.3.4$ represents $4! = 24.$

Sometimes an overline bar (called a vinculum) is used instead of parentheses for grouping purposes.

Miscellaneous terms:

vulgar fraction = a quotient of integers written in vertical fraction format
impossible number = non-real complex number
possible number = real number
finite value/quantity = (especially before late 1800s) nonzero value/quantity
absolute term =  constant term (e.g. of a polynomial)
numerically greater =  absolute value is greater
algebraically greater = greater as signed numbers
contrary signs = opposite signs
vanishing fraction = $0/0$ indeterminate form
integral rational function = polynomial
integral function = power series
development = series expansion
line = curve (e.g. not necessarily a straight line)
right line or straight line = line
curve of $n$ dimensions = curve of algebraic degree $n$
rectilinear asymptote =  linear/oblique asymptote
invariable quantity = constant quantity
squared paper = graph paper
the term be wanting = the term is absent
equation is rigorous = exact equality holds
steadily towards = monotonically towards
rigid proof = rigorous proof

Colloquial journal names:

Annales de Gergonne = Annales de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées
Crelle's Journal and Borchardt's journal = Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik
Darboux's Bulletin = Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques et Astronomiques [“et Astronomiques” was later dropped]
Grunert's Archiv = Archiv der Mathematik und Physik
Hoffmann's Journal = Zeitschrift fur Mathematischen und Naturwissenschaftlichen Unterricht
Liouville's Journal = Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées
Terquem's journal = Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques
II. Glossary of early to mid 20th century terms in some nowhere differentiable continuous functions literature:
The following list is from near the beginning of this mathoverflow answer.
enumerable = countable
unenumerable = uncountable
progressive derivative = right derivative
regressive derivative = left derivative
non-dense = nowhere dense
everywhere dense = dense in the smallest interval containing the set (sometimes “dense”, without being prefaced by “everywhere”, means in context “everywhere dense”)
incrementary ratio = the ordinary difference quotient that a derivative is the limit of
line of invariability (of a function) = an interval on which the function is constant
the set exists = the set is not empty.
