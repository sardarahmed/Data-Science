Q:

Did the author of Alice in Wonderland make any substantial original discoveries in mathematics?

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known by his pen name of Lewis Carroll, was a mathematics lecturer at Oxford University and today is primarily famous for his fanciful stories laced with mathematical and logical jokes. He also seems to have been a somewhat prolific writer of math textbooks in his day, but it's not clear whether he made any significant original discoveries in math.
Did he?

A:

I used C. L. DODGSQN, Condensation of determinants. Proc. Royal Sot. London 15 (1866). 150-155 in one of my papers. But for some reason I cited a secondary reference instead, D. P. Robbins and H. Rumsey, Jr., Determinants and alternatig sign matrices, Adv. Math. 62 (1986), 169-184.
