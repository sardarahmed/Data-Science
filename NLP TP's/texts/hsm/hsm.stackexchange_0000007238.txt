Q:

Earliest known usage of letter gamma "Î“" for reducible representation in group theory

Does any know the earliest known usage of the Greek letter gamma for showing a reducible representation of a group? This symbolism is commonly used in character tables in chemical applications of group theory, for example as shown here. Thank you in advance.

A:

Early examples are Burnside (1910, pp. 324-325; 1911, p. 271) where $\color{red}{\textrm{ir}}$reducible representations are called $\Gamma$, $\Gamma_1$, $\Gamma_2$, etc. (Earlier in (1901) he had called them $G_1$, $G_2$, etc.)
Speiser (1923, p. 104; 1927, p. 151) uses the same convention, but allows $\Gamma$ to be reducible.
Note that for them a representation is not a homomorphism to $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ (a map) but rather its image (a group). So your question morphs into: who first wrote $\Gamma$ for a group of linear substitutions? Now that goes back to at least Jordan (1870, pp. 221 sq).
