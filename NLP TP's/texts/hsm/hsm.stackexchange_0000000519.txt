Classical physics - A timeline of Mechanics

As a chemist we never really use classical mechanics much instead favouring a quantum description of the world around us. I have been lectured plenty on the origins of quantum mechanics and how the early pioneers forged away to develop ultimately quantum field theory. However I have very little idea about the analogous timeline of classical mechanics! 
As such I will list my understanding but would love it if someone could fill in the blanks! (I'm starting at Newton and after more modern scientists :) 
1) Newton 
2) d'Alembert
3) Lagrange 
4) Hamilton
5) Poisson
6) Liouville
7) Poincare
8) Noether

A:

Here are some crucial contributors that are missing:
Archimedes (statics, including hydrostatics)
Stevin (Guido Jorg suggestion)
Galileo (relativity principle, pendulum, falling bodies etc.)
Huygens (pendulum, oscillations, Huygens principle)
Hooke (Hooke's Law, Inverse squares law)
Daniel Bernoulli (hydrodynamics)
Clairaut (perturbation methods, figures of equilibrium)
Euler (contributed to almost everything, motion of rigid bodies, for example, Euler-Lagrange equations, perturbation theory)
Laplace (celestial mechanics)
Jacobi (integrable systems)
Lindstedt (perturbation methods)
Hill (perturbation methods)
Lyapunov (stability, figures of equilibrium)
Birkhoff (closed orbits, ergodic theory)
Fatou, Bogolyubov, Krylov ("non-linear mechanics")
von Neumann (ergodic theory)
Siegel (stability)
Kolmogorov, Arnold, Moser (KAM theory)
I omitted: statistical mechanics (which is also mechanics!), most of the fluid mechanics
after Archimedes and Bernoulli) and relativistic mechanics.
