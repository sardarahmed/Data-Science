Q:

Why was Courant's "Methods of Mathematical Physics" suppressed, by the Germans, during WW2?

In the preface to Methods of Mathematical Physics Richard Courant, the author, wrote that the book was suppressed by the National Socialist rulers(Nazi) of Germany. 
Hence, my question. Thanks. 

A:

I think because Richard Courant 

left Germany in 1933, earlier than many Jewish escapees. He did not lose his position due to being Jewish, as his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him; however, his public membership in the social-democratic left was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal.

See the dates of the editions of Methoden der mathematischen Physik.
