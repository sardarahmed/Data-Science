Q:

Who is the Dottie number named after?

I have learned about the Dottie number, though I am unsure to whom it is attributed to and why it is named as so.

A:

The Dottie number is named in Samuel Kaplan's (2007) paper after the women who discovered it.

The Dottie number was the nickname among my graduate school friends
for the unique real root of cos(x) = x.  The story goes that Dottie, a
professor of French, noticed that whenever she put a number in the
calculator and hit the cos button over and over again, the number on
the screen always went to the same value, about 0.739085.
