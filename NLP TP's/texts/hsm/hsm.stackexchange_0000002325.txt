Q:

On the development of Newtonian Mechanics

Having borrowed from the library an English translation of Newton's Principia (Motte's), I read the begining sections, Part 1 and the Systems of the world, and noticed that Newton did physics completely differently than is currently taught in a classical mechanics course. He uses synthetic geometry with certain theorems on limits, or a geometric calculus, which is very different from the symbolic calculus we used. Furthermore, he only uses scalar quantities instead of vector ones. Finally, he seems to define three types of forces, accelerative, absolute and motive forces. His derivation of Kepler's second law is completely different than the ones currently taught. When did physics texts then begin to discuss or teach newtonian mechanics in the modern analytical way using symbolic calculus, coordinate systems and vectors with free body diagrams?  

A:

According to Truesdell [1954]:

(p. xliii:) As far as I can ascertain, it is Euler [1750, p. 196] which contains the first general statement of “Newton’s equations”. (p. xlii:) The axioms which Euler asserts “include all principles of mechanics” are
  $$
2M\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=P,\qquad
2M\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=Q,\qquad
2M\frac{d^2z}{dt^2}=R.
$$
  (...) Anyone who has looked at Newton's Principia knows that no such equations occur in it.

I think he's right, except that Euler actually did it earlier in [1747, p. 103]:

Cela posé, prenant l'element du tems $dt$ pour constant, le changement instantané du mouvement du Corps sera exprimé par ces trois équations:
  $$
\textrm{I.}\quad \frac{2ddx}{dt^2}=\frac XM;\qquad
\textrm{II.}\quad \frac{2ddy}{dt^2}=\frac YM;\qquad
\textrm{III.}\quad \frac{2ddz}{dt^2}=\frac ZM
$$
  d'où l'on pourra tirer pour chaque tems ecoulé $t$ les valeurs $x$, $y$, $z$, & par conséquent l'endroit où le Corps se trouvera. C. Q. F. T.

Maltese [2003, 2006] has more on e.g. Euler and vectors.

A:

One cannot answer "when" because this was a "slow", gradual development.
And it continues. Some milestones are
the work of d'Alembert, Euler and Clairaut, then 
Lagrange's Mechanique analytique. It does not use a single figure, only formal calculus, and Lagrange was very proud of this. Then comes Laplace, Poisson, Hamilton and Hamiltonian mechanics. Vectors is a much later invention (end of 19 century, in physics). The modern formulation uses the language of manifolds, cotangent spaces and differential forms. 
Modern high school and elementary university courses reflect approximately the level reached in the beginning of 20-s century, except vectors. Vectors penetrated elementary education only in the second half of 20-s century.
Remark. If you read what Newton wrote on Calculus, you will not recognize absolutely what is taught in modern courses. Modern calculus, as taught nowadays
owes more to Leibniz, Bernoulli and Euler than to Newton. But here too there was a gradual development. Two parallel developments: on the advanced level, and another one, in elementary education which lags the advanced level by 50-100 years.
