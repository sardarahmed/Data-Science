Q:

Who discovered the famous combinatorial intepretation of Eulerian numbers?

Eulerian numbers $A(n, k)$ were discovered by Euler in 1755 in his work Institutiones calculi differentialis. In combinatorics, they count the number permutations of the numbers 1 to $n$ with exactly $k$ ascents.
I do not find any further information about the develop of Eulerian numbers from 1755 to now (for example I do not find any information about who discovered the combinatorial intepretation).
Does anyone have these informations? Thank you.

A:

For what it's worth (Tingyao Xiong, Hung-Ping Tsao, Jonathan I. Hall, "General Eulerian Numbers and Eulerian Polynomials", Journal of Mathematics, vol. 2013, Article ID 629132, 9 pages, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/629132):

The following combinatorial definition of Eulerian numbers was
discovered by Riordan in the 1950s.
