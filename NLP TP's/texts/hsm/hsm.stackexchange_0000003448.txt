Q:

History of $0 \in \mathbb N$.

There are different conventions around whether $0 \in \mathbb N$. 
I know that $\mathbb N = \{0,1,2,3, \cdots\}$ is called the Bourbakian definition of $\mathbb N$. But did this convention really come form Bourbaki?
In the axioms of Peano, which were earlier, 0 was also taken as a natural number.
So where did each convention ($0 \in \mathbb N$ and $0 \not\in \mathbb N$) come form?

A:

For modern times:

Richard Dedekind, Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen? (1888), page 20:

§71. Definition. A system $N$ [Ein system $N$] is said to be simply infinite when there exists a similar transformation $\phi$ of $N$ in itself such that $N$ appears as chain of an element not contained in $\phi(N)$. We call this element, which we shall denote in what follows by the symbol $1$, the base-element of N and say the simply infinite system $N$ is set in order by this transformation $\phi$.

[...]

§73. Definition. If in the consideration of a simply infinite system $N$ set in order by a transformation $\phi$ [...] these elements [are] called natural numbers or ordinal numbers or simply numbers, and the base-element $1$ is called the base-number of the number-series $N$.

Giuseppe Peano, Arithmetices Principia Novo Methodo Exposita (1889), page 1:

Axiomata

$1 \in N$

Gottlob Frege, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik: eine logisch mathematische Untersuchung über den Begriff der Zahl (1884):

§74. Null [$0$] ist die Anzahl, welche dem Begriffe "sich selbst ungleich" zukommt.

Bertrand Russell, The Principles of Mathematics (1903):

§120. Peano’s three indefinables are $0$, finite integer and successor of. [...] Peano’s primitive propositions are then the following.

(1) $0$ is a number.

Mario Pieri, Sopra gli assiomi aritmetici (1907):

$\gamma.$ There is at least one number that is not the successor of any number. [...]
$f.$ The number $0$ that is not the successor of any number [...] is given the name zero.

For Bourbaki, see:

Nicolas Bourbaki, Théorie des ensembles (2nd ed 1970), Ch.III, §3:

1. Le cardinal d'un ensemble

On note $0$ le cardinal $\text {Card} (\emptyset)$.
