Q:

Who was the first to hypothesise that gravity from one mass causes the spacetime around another mass to curve?

Was it Einstein? Or was there someone before him to hypothesise this?

A:

The first metric theory of gravitation, in which the effects of gravitation are treated entirely in terms of the geometry of curved spacetime, was published by Finnish physicist Gunnar Nordström in 1913. Einstein published his own theory of general relativity in 1915.
The measurement of the deflection of light passing close to the Sun during the solar eclipse of 1919 (the Eddington experiment) produced results that agreed with Einstein's theory, whereas Nordström's theory predicted no deflection. Nordström subsequently nominated Einstein for the Nobel Prize in Physics.
