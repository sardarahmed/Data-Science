Q:

Who first proved that only primes of the form $4k+1$ divide odd integers of the form $n^2+1$?

I am writing a paper and I would like to cite the person(s) who proved that only primes of the form $4k+1$ can evenly divide odd integers of the form $n^2+1$?
For example, if $n=8$, $n^2 + 1 = 65$ which is evenly divisible by 5 and 13, both of which are of the form $4k + 1$.

A:

It would seem to be Euler. Dickson, in Ch. XVI of History of the  Theory of Numbers, writes the following:

"Euler discussed the numbers $a$ for which $a^2+1$ is divisible by a prime $4n+1=r^2+s^2$. Let $p/q$ be the convergent preceding $r/s$ in the continued fraction for $r/s$; then $ps-qr=1$. Thus every $a$ is of the form $(4n+1)m\pm k$, where $k=pr+qs$. Euler gave the $161$ integers $a< 1500$ for which $a^2+1$ is a prime, and the cases $a= 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 20, 24, 34$ for which $a^4+1$ is a prime.

The first appearance is in the letter to Goldbach from July 9, 1743. Euler came back to these numbers in 1755 and 1762:

[...] Euler treated the problem to find all integers for which $a^2+1$ is divisible by a given prime $4n+1=p^2+q^2$. If $a^2+b^2$ is divisible by $p^2+q^2$, there exist integers $r,s$ such that $a=pr+qs,b=ps-qr$. We wish $b=\pm1$. Hence we take the convergent $r/s$ preceding $p/q$ in the continued fraction for $p/q$. Thus $ps-qr=\pm1$, and our answer is $a=(pr+qs)$. He listed all primes $P=4n+1<2000$ expressed as $p^2+q^2$, and listed all the $a$'s for which $a^2+1$ is divisible by $P$. The table may be used to find all the divisors $<a$ of $a$ given number $a^2+1$. He gave his table and tabulated the values $a<1500$ for which $(a2+1)/k$ is a prime, for $k=2, 5, 10$. He tabulated all the divisors of $a^2+1$ for $a\leq1500$."

Fermat is mentioned on the same page, but only in connection with something else, so I doubt that he looked into factorizations of $a^2+1$. Lehmer in Guide to Tables in the Theory of Numbers (p.31) also names Euler as the first to produce a factorization table of $a^2+1$ numbers in 1762, and nobody else.
As for Fermat, there are almost no proofs by him in existence, a notable exception is a case of his Last theorem for $n=4$. Euler generally made it his task to sort out Fermat's guesses. For example, Fermat "knew" that $2^{2^n}+1$ were all primes, after checking the first four. Euler computed $2^{2^5}+1=641\times6700417$. No other primes of this form turned up since.
