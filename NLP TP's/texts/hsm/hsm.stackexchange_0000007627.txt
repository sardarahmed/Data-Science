Q:

Was annihilation considered in 1905?

The positron was discovered in 1932, did physicist have any knowledge or  assumed that matter could be annihilated into energy at the start of XX century?

A:

Let us consider the following info on developments prior to 1905.

Before 1905 (The forthcoming of $E = mc^2$)
1881 J. J. Thompson proposed that a charged conductor in motion increases its mass by $\frac{4}{15} e^2/a$
1904 H. A. Lorentz proposed that $m_L = m_0 (1 – v^2/c^2)^{-3/2}$ based on deformable spherical charge.
1904 Hasenöhrl derived an apparent mass increase of a moving cavity containing electromagnetic energy E, obtaining  $m_e = \frac{8}{3} E/c^2$.
1905 On Abraham’s suggestion, Hasenöhrl corrected this to  $m_e = \frac{4}{3} E/c^2$

Based on the study of the historical development of concepts, one may deduce that the equation $E = mc^2$ would have been discovered by other physicists sooner or later. However, it is likely that Einstein merely accelerated the development.

our contention is that though annihilation of particles was not an acceptable concept prior to 1905 but other ways of energy conversion of mass was being attempted.
