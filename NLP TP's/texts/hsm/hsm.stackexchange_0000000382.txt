Q:

Who invented the Haversine formula (or at least the oldest paper in which it was cited)?

Note: this was original an example question, posted by neizod. As I mentioned in meta, it would be nice if we could get the example questions asked on the site. neizod did not commit to the site and has not yet joined, so I will place it here. I can make this post community wiki if the community feels this is the right thing to do. I have also rephrased it, as per the suggestion on area51 of @J.W.Perry.

Who invented the Haversine formula (or at least the oldest paper in which it was cited)?

The relevant Wikipedia page.

A:

Don Josef de Mendoza y Rios, F.R.S. Recherches sur les principaux Problemes de l'Astronomie Nautique, Proc. Royal Soc., Dec 22, 1796.
He himself calls this sinus-verse and cosinus-verse.
Wikipedia article which you cite in your question contains a reference on Mendoza y Rios,
but on a slightly later paper of 1801.
