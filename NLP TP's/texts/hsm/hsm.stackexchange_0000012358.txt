Q:

Where to pursue a PhD in history of mathematics in Europe?

This is more a soft question, and I am not sure where I should place it so I ask for excuses if this is not the right place, but I could not find any other that seemed more suitable.
I would like to know which Universities in Europe are as of 2020 having or offering a PhD in history of mathematics. Of course, I do not expect a full list but at least a list of some Math Departments having a certain "tradition" on the subject.
Also, I do not know what skills (at any level) are desirable to study History of Mathematics (speaking/understanding several different languages is something useful? what about knowing latin or greek?).
Thanks advance.
