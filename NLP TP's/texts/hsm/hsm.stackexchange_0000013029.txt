Q:

G. Washington notes on geometry

Do you know if  there is a pdf file containing President George Washington's notes on geometry and surveying somewhere in the Internet?
I recall reading a few weeks ago that those notes had been recently made publicly available by the Library of Congress but I could not find a single file containing all of them in the relevant site:
https://www.loc.gov/resource/mgw1a.002/?sp=2
If it is actually not possible to have these notes in a single pdf file, do you know of an expert on President Washington that has written about what it is that we are to find in those manuscripts?
Thanks in advance.

A:

The historian of mathematics Fred Rickey (West Point) may have some information of use to you. He is a scholar who has published multiple papers on George Washington's notes. If a complete version of Washington's notes is available online, Fred Rickey might well know how to find it.
