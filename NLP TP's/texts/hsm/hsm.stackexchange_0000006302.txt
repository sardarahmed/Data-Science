Q:

When was the speed of sound first "correctly" calculated?

I am not a student of thermodynamics, but I will reproduce some equations and discussion from Wikipedia to highlight the principles involved in obtaining a fairly accurate — one percent perhaps — value for the speed of sound in air.
From the article Speed of sound:
$$c=\sqrt{\frac{K_s}{\rho}}$$
where $K_s$ is "...a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic bulk modulus (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases)" and the isentropic bulk modulus $K_s=\gamma p$ where $p$ is the pressure, and the heat capacity ratio $\gamma$ for a diatomic gas is equal to $1+2/5$ or 1.4. 
The article continues: "For general equations of state, if classical mechanics is used, the speed of sound c is given by":
$$c=\sqrt{\left( \frac{dp}{d\rho} \right)_s}$$
where again $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ the density, and the derivative is taken isentropically, that is, at constant entropy $s$.
I'm wondering if there is any well recognized first accurate calculation of the speed of sound from modern principles? I realize the history of science is a continuum and it's likely concepts were added in stages, but it's possible there was a moment when a theory was first developed such that it produced a nearly-correct speed of sound, and there was an "aha!"  

A:

One of the first theories is due to Newton. He derived a formula for the speed of sound from his wave theory, and compared with experiment.
(The experiment was difficult at that time, because of the lack of exact clocks).
His theory had a reasonable agreement with the experiment but was not very precise because he did not take thermodynamics into account at all (it did not exist!).
With the development of thermodynamics, more and more precise theories were developed. In the last edition of Principia, Newton arrived at the number 1142 feet/sec, which was in good agreement with the latest measurements.
The details of the story are described in
Westfall, Never at rest, p. 734-735. But one cannot point the exact moment when "accurate" theory was created, while all previous theories were inaccurate or incorrect. The history after (and before!) Newton is described in detail in this article:

The paper is concentrated on Laplace's contribution but many people were involved, and one cannot point the precise moment when the theory "became accurate". But this happened in the early 19th century.
