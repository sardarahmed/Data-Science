Q:

What are the most precise measurements in science?

In 1957, Littlewood wrote that these are measurements of time in astronomy.
Astronomers operate with times intervals between astronomical events 1000 years apart with accuracy 1/1000 of a second. This gives 14 significant digits. Has this situation changed since?
I mean ONLY the numbers related to physical phenomena,
not pure mathematical calculations outcomes like, for example, the digits of $\pi$.
To make it more precise, I am not asking about the
numbers like $3.256\cdot 10^{-19}$. I am asking about numbers with 14 or more significant digits
(that is all zeros on the left of the dot must be discarded).

A:

The answer is optical atomic clocks which are now pushing 19 digits of precision on the accuracy of the estimation of atomic transition frequencies. Citations to follow when I have time to add them. These technologies were enabled by advanced in lasers, laser cooling, atomic physics, and optical frequency combs.
Note these are state of the art atomic clocks. The atomic clocks used for establishing the TAI timescale are still sitting around 15 digits of precision on their accuracy of realizing the SI definition of the second.
The most accurate measurement which I am aware of is of the clock transition frequency in one of the $\text{Al}^+$ quantum logic ion atomic clocks at NIST. See Brewer et. al. (2019). Here the authors interrogate a $\text{Al}^+$ ion with a laser beam and they estimate that the ratio of their uncertainty in the lasers frequency $\Delta \nu$ to the laser frequency $\nu$ is
$$
\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = 9.4\times 10^{-19}
$$
Here is their error budget:

We see the leading term is excess micromotion. This refers to the fact that the ion feels a force due to the RF fields used to trap it in place. This force causes the ion to oscillate, and this oscillation of the ion results in Doppler shifts of the ions actual transition frequency. The authors estimate the magnitude of this shift to be at the $-45.8 \times 10^{-19}$ level but their uncertainty is at the $5.9 \times 10^{-19}$ level, leaving it as the leading term in their error budget.
One question that jumps to my mind that I'm still researching the answer on: Why report the fractional uncertainty only without reporting that actual $\text{Al}^+$ clock transition frequency out to 19 digits? The answer is related to the fact that our current absolute frequency standards are based on $\text{Cs}$ atomic clocks which only have a fractional frequency uncertainty at the $10^{-16}$ level or so. If you want to know the absolute frequency of any oscillator you must have some chain of clock frequency comparisons eventually tying you back to $\text{Cs}$ clocks. But I believe, because the $\text{Cs}$ clocks are limited to $10^{-16}$ stability, it is not possible to know ANY absolute frequency to better than $10^{-16}$. Folks at NIST are considering a road map towards transitioning from $\text{Cs}$ based definition of the second towards a optical-clock based definition of the second so that we could all reap the benefits of a realization of the SI second with better fractional frequency stability. This is the same case that is always made to redefine the second to take advantage of more stable and accurate clocks. e.g. when we switched from quartz oscillators to atomic clocks in the first place, or from astronomical measures of time towards clock-based measures. See here for more details about the roadmap to redefine the second going forward. Right now it is not easy to make an optical atomic clock, this is a major impediment towards adopting this technology as the primary frequency reference.
LIGO gravitational wave detection is probably a good honorable mention for most precise measurements in science, but I think optical clocks still have it beat. Experts in both fields may have more to say.

A:

The most precise measurements tend to be measurements of ratios or differences.  For example, we know the ratio of the charge on the proton to the charge on the electron to 21 decimal places, despite only knowing what the charge on an electron is* to nine decimal places.  Similarly, the LIGO observatories can measure changes in the distance between the mirrors of one part in 1022, despite only having a rough idea of how far apart the mirrors actually are.
*If you're working in the 2019 version of the SI system, the elementary charge is a fixed numeric value, and you're actually measuring a combination of other quantities.

A:

The periods of millisecond pulsars are measured to 15 significant figures.  E.g., here's a paper that gives the period of PSR J1853+1303 as 4.09179744490025(2) ms (the figure in parentheses is the uncertainty in the final digit.)
