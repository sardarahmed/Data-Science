Q:

Euler's proof of infinite primes first since Euclid?

Q. Is it true that Euler's proof of infinite primes was the first since Euclid's which was from around 300BC?

Note: By Euler's proof, I mean the use of his Euler product formula for the zeta function $\zeta(s)$ which diverges as $s\rightarrow\infty$, implying an infinitude of factors in the product, which means an infinite of primes.

A:

There is a proof by Goldbach, which appears in a letter he wrote to Euler in 1730 (a few years before Euler published his product formula for the zeta function). It is as follows: if $F_n=2^{2^n}+1$ (that is, if $F_n$ is the $n$th Fermat number), then$$F_n=F_1F_2\ldots F_{n-1}+2.\tag1$$Since each $F_n$ is odd, it follows from $(1)$ that, if $n\ne m$, then $F_n$ and $F_m$ are relatively prime. So, take a prime factor $p_n$ of $F_n$, and the set $\{p_1,p_2,p_3,\ldots\}$ will be an infinite set of prime numbers.
