Q:

Introduction of $\imath$ and $\jmath$ notations for the imaginary unit

The imaginary unit is generally denoted $i$ or $\imath$. I have learned that the term imaginary ("imaginaires") was coined by R. Descartes in 1637, and the "i" notation was introduced by L. Euler (cf. Short History of Complex Numbers). In engineering and physics, the notation $j$ or $\jmath$ is often used. Some say it was used to limit confusions with the current, often denoted $i$ or "I", as noted at Electric current:

The conventional symbol for current is I, which originates from the
  French phrase intensité de courant, meaning current intensity .

My questions are:

Was the $\imath$ (or $i$) notation used before Euler?
Who introduced the $\jmath$ (or $j$) notation?

EDIT: I just found, answering on a different topic about frequency, a mention of the word "cisoid" (abbreviated as $\mathrm{cis}$), I just found Cisoidal Oscillations, 1911, by George A. Campbell, where he writes:

The use of $i$ (or Greek $\imath$) for the imaginary symbol is nearly
  universal in mathematical work, which is a very strong reason for
  retaining it in the applications of mathematics in electrical
  engineering. Aside, however, from the matter of established
  conventions and facility of reference to mathematical literature, the
  substitution of the symbol $j$ is objectionable because of the vector
  terminology with which it has become associated in engineering
  literature, and also because of the confusion resulting from the
  divided practice of engineering writers, some using $j$ for $+i$ and
  others using $j$ for $- i$

So the story is not fully new, and we could date the $j$ before 1911.

A:

In answer to your second part of the question regarding $j$ for $\sqrt{-1}$, this was introduced into text books describing Power System Analysis of AC power circuits in the early 1900s by Charles P. Steinmetz.  I am not sure of the earliest date but my guess is between late 1890s and 1920s but certainly no later than 1923 as Steinmetz died in 1923.
Steinmetz is to Power Systems Engineers (EEs) as Einstein and $E=m c²$ is to physicists (and everyone else for that matter).
