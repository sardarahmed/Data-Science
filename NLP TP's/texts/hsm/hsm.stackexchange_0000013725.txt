Q:

Abel-Runge lemma

I read recently that there exists an Abel-Runge lemma. What is it? Google does not give an answer. I know about Abel's lemma (the summation by parts) and the Runge-Kutta method but I have never heard about Abel-Runge lemma before.
Update. This is a history of mathematics question. Apparently there was a result of Abel which was later modified (generalized?) by Runge. I do not know the work of Runge well enough to find out what it was. Hence the question.

A:

I found two papers by Runge about solving polynomial equations (one published in 1885, Runge, C. On the solvable equations of the form $x^5+ u x + v = 0$ (German) Acta Math. 7 (1885), no. 1, 173-186, and one published in 1963, about 40 years after Runge's death, by Ostrovski, Runge, Carl
Eine Vorzeichenregel in der Theorie der algebraischen Gleichungen. (German)
Jber. Deutsch. Math.-Verein. 66 (1963/64), Abt. 1, 52â€“66). None of them mentions Abel. So I guess the Abel-Runge lemma does not exist and this answers my question.
