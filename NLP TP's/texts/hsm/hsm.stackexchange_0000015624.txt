Q:

The Original Title of "Euclid's Elements"

What did Euclid originally call his treatise of thirteen books that we now refer to as "Euclid's Elements" ?
Was it "The Elements" ? Was it something else ? Does anyone know the exact Greek title ?

A:

It is "Στοιχεῖα" [ Stoikheîa ] in Ancient Greek.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements :

Euclid's Elements (Ancient Greek: Στοιχεῖα Stoikheîa) is a mathematical treatise consisting of 13 books attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt c. 300 BC.

Interesting titbit/trivia :
I recognized a word from my Chemistry Classes , hence I had a guess about Stoichiometry , which turned out to be true . . . .

https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Chemical_Reactions/Stoichiometry_and_Balancing_Reactions :

In Greek, stoikhein means element and metron means measure, so stoichiometry literally translated means the measure of elements.

[[ that Chemistry text may have a typo there : "singular of stoicheīa is stoicheīon, not stoicheīn" , curtesy of user "BakerStreet" ]]
When we make the Singular to the Plural , we get Stoikheîa , which is what Euclid wrote.
