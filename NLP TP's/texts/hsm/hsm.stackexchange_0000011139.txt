Q:

Did anyone mention the possibility of antimatter before 1928?

In 1932 positron and annihilation were discovered, but in 1928 Dirac had provided a formula allowing for the positron
Did anyone between that date and the discovery of electron ever imagine or suggest of antimatter or a positive electron. How did they interpret the electron?

A:

Not quite as specific as what you're looking for, but searching google-books using the phase "positive electron" for 1800-1931 gives several pages of hits. Most of these use the phrase in connection with atomic nuclei (or with alpha particles, prior to Rutherford's famous scattering experiment), but some appear to involve speculation about the existence of a positively charged analog of the electron, such the following two. I don't have any more details about the 1928 reference because this journal does not seem to be freely available on the internet. However, the journal can probably be found in most major U.S. universities (e.g. all print volumes from 1861 are at The University of Iowa). I tried adding "Dirac" to the search results, and two or three things looked promising, but none seemed to be freely available, and thus I'll leave it to you or others to pursue further.

(from bottom of p. 9) ... no evidence has been obtained of the existence of a positive electron corresponding to the negative electron.

(from p. 194) Let us, for instance, picture a true equivalent to the negative electron---a positive electron of the same infinitesimal atomic weight. Then if ...
