Q:

What are some notable contributions of mathematical logic to mathematics (outside of mathematical logic)?

I have been reading an introductory text in mathematical logic (Holden, 1995).  The final chapter presents the resolution of Hilberts's tenth problem concerning the integer roots of an arbitrary polynomial over $\mathbb Z$.
The resolution (to the negative) follows from a theorem of Yuri Matiyasevich which tells us that every recursively enumerable relation/function is Diophantine.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that a resolution comes via mathematical logic - after all, it is a decidability problem.  On the other hand, it is a very natural question with a long history whose resolution is of fundamental importance to Diophantine analysis.
Q:  What are some examples of mathematical logic being successfully applied elsewhere?

Rightly or wrongly, I consider set theory to be a part of mathematical logic, so, for example, the CH independence proofs of Cohen and Gödel I am considering to be part of logic.

A:

The van den Dries-Wilkie proof of Gromov polynomial growth theorem is a non-trivial and very fruitful application of logic (model theory to be precise) to group theory and geometry.

There is a survey of such applications in
