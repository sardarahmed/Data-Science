Q:

When did it become a mainstream stereotype that physicists hate philosophy?

Question
I'm searching for the origin of the stereotype (regardless of validity) that physicists hate philosophy? This opinion seems to be more mainstream in the public domain. I do concede they are some(/many) physicists who do. 
Historically I know the word scientist has not been around for too long. I'm guessing somewhere between then and now something happened?

The tipping point most probably was the so called Science Wars,
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_wars
particularly the Sokal affair
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair
Alan Sokal submitted for publication an article title "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity",  proposing that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct.

In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic
  journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an
  experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor and, specifically,
  to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural
  studies—whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric
  Jameson and Andrew Ross—[would] publish an article liberally salted
  with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors'
  ideological preconceptions"

The origin of these Science Wars can be traced back to the publication of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962, 
and the subsequent interpretation by some philosophers that Kuhn's ideas meant that scientific theories were, either wholly or in part, social constructs, 
Note: the "hate" is/was against postmodernist philosophy, particularly Post-structuralism (Derrida and such luminaries!).
