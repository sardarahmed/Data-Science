Q:

History of delta barrier in quantum mechanics

I'm interested in finding something out about the history of the problem of the delta potential barrier in quantum mechanics.
Which was the first study to propose this problem, and perhaps any particular motivation for it?
I am aware of some of the usual motivations for using it, but any examples that come to mind are appreciated.

A:

After looking for a while this is what I have found, although it does not mean that perhaps earlier references do not exist.
In the review article by M. Belloni and R. W. Robinett, 
"The infinite well and Dirac delta function potentials as pedagogical, mathematical and physical models in quantum mechanics", PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS  Volume: 540   Issue: 2   Pages: 25-122   Published: JUL 10 2014,
there is a section in which the delta potential is discussed at some length. They seem to find the first references to the use of the delta barrier in the classic article by R. de L. Kronig and W. G. Penney
"Quantum Mechanics of Electrons in Crystal Lattices" Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A  Volume: 130   Pages: 499-513   Published: 1931.
There, the delta potential is introduced as the limit of zero width but constant area of square potential barriers. 
Morse and Feshbach's treatise "Methods of Theoretical Physics" in v. 2 (published in 1953) discusses the single delta potential problem (as a well). Belloni and Robinett above make a note of this.
