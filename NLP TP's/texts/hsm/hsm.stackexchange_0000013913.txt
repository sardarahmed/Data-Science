Q:

Armstrong numbers - who is or was Armstrong?

According to Wolfram's MathWorld article "Narcissistic Number", such numbers are also called "Armstrong numbers".
Such a number is an $n$-digit number $N$ such that:
$$N = {d_1}^n + {d_2}^n + \cdots + {d_n}^n$$
where $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$ are the digits in $N$.
They crop up over and over again in collections of recreational mathematics problems.
The question that I can't find the answer to is: who is (or was) "Armstrong"?
The best guess I can find is a line on ProofWiki stating that "there are rumours that he may have been a Michael Armstrong of Polk City in Florida", but I can't find anything corroborating this.

A:

As you have pointed out, Armstrong numbers seem to have been named after Michael Armstrong of Polk City in Florida. This is clear from an email he wrote to a Web Blogger in which he talks about giving the problem of “Armstrong numbers” to his computing class at University of Rochester. However, it is not known how his name became attached to the class of numbers. Below is his email from Lionel Deimel's blog:

In the mid 1960s -- probably around 1966 -- I was teaching an
elementary course in Fortran and computing in general at The
University of Rochester, and “invented” Armstrong Numbers as an
exercise for my students. I still have the original coffee-stained
paper that was the master copy for the homework assignment and would
be happy to send you a copy if the silverfish in the garage haven’t
totally devoured it. (Full Disclosure: My memory being what it
is(n’t), I can’t say that I sat down and invented them out of whole
cloth, but I certainly don’t remember reading about them anywhere. The
paper and assignment were meant as a spoof on serious mathematical
papers that often didn’t seem to have much purpose. In any event, I am
reasonably certain that this was the first association of the name
with the numbers.)
I remember there were Armstrong Numbers of several Kinds and Orders,
but don’t remember much detail, which is pretty much true of most of
my life in the 60s. The students tried to compute almost all of them,
and the sharper ones quickly realized that Fortran wasn’t the best way
to do the job. They rewrote their algorithms first in assembly
language (for an IBM 7000 series machine), and later in hard machine
language to get the last bit of speed possible. As a reward, we ran
the winning algorithm as the system’s idle process for a few nights,
resulting in a very long list of Armstrong numbers (of the first Kind,
anyway).
As serendipity would have it, I was in Australia at a meeting in
February, 1988, when a short piece on “Armstrong’s Numbers” by Tim
Hartnell, one of their regular columnists, was printed in The
Australian (Tuesday, February 23rd). I immediately dashed off a note
to him asking if he was talking about MY Armstrong Numbers, or some
other Armstrong’s Armstrong numbers. We carried on a brief and cordial
correspondence, and he published a followup article about finally
finding out who “The Great Man” was in the April 19 issue. I guess
that was my 15 minutes of fame.
