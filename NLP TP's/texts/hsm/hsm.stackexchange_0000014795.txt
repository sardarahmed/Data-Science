Q:

What was the quote about known things being trivial and unknown things being impossible?

I am new to this portion of stack exchange and am not sure if this type of question is allowed, but after seeing this, I assume it is.
A while back, I remember reading a quote about math that said something along the lines of “Before you know the answer, it is impossible; once you do, it’s trivial”. I think the quote even used the terms “trivial” and “impossible”, but I can’t find it again.
The closest I’ve found is “In mathematics, there are only two kinds of proofs: Trivial ones, and undiscovered ones”, but that’s not it as the actual quote used “impossible”.

I believe you're referring to this particular quote:
“All of physics is either impossible or trivial. It is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial.” - Ernest Rutherford
