Q:

In what instances did Wolfgang Pauli say that something was 'not even wrong'?

One famous quote I've heard of Wolfgang Pauli is

It is not even wrong.

I've also heard that Pauli had a blustery, often unpleasant personality, and I vaguely recall hearing the phrase used in multiple instances. In which instances did Pauli use this phrase?

A:

This isn’t right. This isn’t even wrong.

Response after reading a colleague’s paper, quoted in The Successful Toastmaster: A Treasure Chest of Introductions, Epigrams, Humor, and Quotations (1966) by Herbert Victor Prochnow, p. 350, and in Mathematical Apocrypha Redux: More Stories and Anecdotes of Mathematicians and the Mathematical (2005) by Steven George Krantz, p. 194.

This paper is so bad it is not even wrong.
