Q:

Why didn't Germany succeed in building a nuclear bomb in second world war?

Otto Hahn (a german) found out about nuclear fission in 1938, so that should have given the Germans a head start in developing a nuclear bomb. However they did not succeed in doing so during WWII. I've heard a lot of reasons why they couldn't do it:

allied bombing
shortages of heavy water and other important raw material
miscalculations (they thought graphite can't be used as moderator)  
moral scruples by leading scientists
German intelligence didn't know about the Manhattan project

But does anybody know, which of these (or any others) have really been relevant? Why didn't the Germans succeed in building a nuclear bomb in second world war?

A:

On my opinion, there are two important reasons:
a) German government did not press the matter. Nobody convinced it that the thing is plausible and important. (In the US there was a lobby who could convince the US president in this. Szilard, V. Bush and Einstein played an important role). 
b) I think even if they wanted, they could not do it. They simply had no enough resources for a project of such scale. I mean resources of all kinds, including human, industrial, economic etc. Look how many top scientists were employed in the Manhattan project. And how many of them were immigrants from Germany, Austria, Italy. There were also problems with all other resources, and bombing played some role too. Look at the Oak Ridge uranium enrichment plant. Where could the Germans build anything comparable? And even if built this could not be kept secret, and would be certainly bombed.
