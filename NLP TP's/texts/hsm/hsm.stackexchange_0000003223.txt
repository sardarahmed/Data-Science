Q:

The first meaningful theorem about convex sets

What is historically first meaningful theorem about general convex sets?
(My guess would be Hyperplane separation theorem, but I can not see any reliable information on who and when it is proved.)

A:

It is not completely clear what "general" means in your question. In arbitrary dimension? Descartes theorem in dimension 3 gives a relation between solid and flat angles
of a convex polytope which is equivalent to the Gauss--Bonnet for this case, and implies Euler's theorem.
The first results on convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension are probably due to Cauchy and Fourier in connection with linear programming (Cauchy actually had something like simplex method). Also Steiner was working on convex polytopes in the first part of 19s century.
But if "general" really means arbitrary convex sets in any dimension, then it is possible indeed that it is the separation theorem. According to Wikipedia it was proved by Edward Helly in 1912, in an infinite dimensional space but not in full generality. Hahn and Banach proved the general version in 1920. What is usually called "Helly's theorem" in the theory of convex sets in finite dimension  was proved in 1913.  
EDIT. Geometrie der Zahlen of Minkowski is 1896 (vol. I) ans 1910 (vo. II).
Search in the Jahrbuch for "konvex" in the title gives only one 19 century paper, and it is about convex curves, not general convex sets.
