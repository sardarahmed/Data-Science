Q:

What was the full name of I. Bernard Cohen?

I've seen quite a few of the names I. Bernard Cohen in the history of science book. But I couldn't find what I. meant.

A:

I am quoting the full footnote published in Seven Decades of History of Science: I. Bernard Cohen (1914–2003). The full text is available in JSTOR Link.

Cohen’s sister, Harriet, was three years older than he; she died in
1994. The “I” in Bernard Cohen’s name has always been a mystery—one he insisted was no mystery at all, remarking to friends that it was like
the “S” in Harry S. Truman. Replying to one author, Cohen complained
that he had “invented a fictitious new name for me, putting it within
square brackets as if I had chosen to hide it and you were revealing
it to the public. What the basis for your invention could possibly
have been, I cannot imagine. Certainly, recourse to any of the
standard sources of bibliographic information would have prevented you
from making this error. Had you consulted the Library of Congress
catalogue, the National Union Catalogue, or Who’s Who, or any other
proper source, you would have found that my correct and full legal
name is (and always has been) and is listed as, I. Bernard Cohen,
which is the name recorded on my birth certificate, my passport, my
FBI clearance, every copyright for some thirty or more books, and
other official records”: I. Bernard Cohen, letter dated 9 Mar. 1992
(courtesy of Susan T. Johnson).

Another online Encyclopedia claims I is for Ierome without any reference. Most likely this is a conjecture. All his publications just use I. so apparently I. has no meaning. It is just a sound.
