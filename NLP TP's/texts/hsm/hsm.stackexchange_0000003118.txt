Q:

History of open cover compactness definition

I have been looking into the history of topology. One thing I am very curious about is the history of the open cover definition of compactness. According to Raman-Sundstr√∂m, this goes back to a lemma in Borels 1894 thesis. However, I have not been able to find what problem Borel was trying to solve or what kind of insight mathematicians like Heine, Borel and Lebesgue were trying to gain in studying open sets.
What motivated the open cover definition of compactness?

A:

There is a famous paper by Alexandroff & Urysohn, I believe, where they analyze many compactness-type definitions for the recently-defined notion of "topological space".  Since "compact" was already used to mean: every sequence has a convergent subsequence, they came up with other names.  They used the term "bicompact" for: every open cover has a finite subcover.  In subsequent years, mathematicians came to see that this was the more fundamental notion, and started to use "compact" for it.  But you may still find the term "bicompact" used in some Russian papers.
