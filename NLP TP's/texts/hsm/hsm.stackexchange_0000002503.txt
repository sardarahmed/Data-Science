Q:

How did Jun John Sakurai die?

How did theoretical physicist Jun John Sakurai die? The only result from extensive googling is that he died "suddenly" while working at CERN. Does anyone know anything more specific?

A:

J.J Sakurai died from aneurysm in his rented flat in France next to CERN, which he was visiting. His body was discovered on Monday, November 1, 1982, the official date of his death, when he didn't show up in CERN but his death probably occurred the preceding Friday evening.
