Q:

Pythagorean and the number 17

I was looking for some properties of the prime numbers, and I found some curiosities of the number 17 in that site.
One of them is this 

17 was called by the Pythagoreans - opposition, obstruction, and evil,
  and the day the Devil triumphed over God.

But, unlike the other curiosities, it has no reference. Have you read anything like that? Can you tell me more about this?

A:

See page 97 of The Mathematical Experience by Davis and Hersh for an explanation of why the Pythagoreans abominated the number 17.  There it says Plutarch wrote that the Egyptians related that the death of Osiris occurred on the seventeenth of the month, when the full moon is most obviously waning.  Also, the number seventeen is between the two numbers (sixteen and eighteen) that can be simultaneously perimeters and areas of rectangles (sides 4 and 4 or 3 and 6).
