Q:

What triggered the general relativity renaissance?

There is a period of general relativity history famous for its lack of activity, where during the 1950's, almost no general relativity was done. Looking through various bibliographies, there were very little papers written on the specific topic of general relativity during that period, save for some papers, mostly by John Synge, L. Markus (mostly writing on the topic as a mathematician) and Bonnor (for the action of EM fields in GR). There's a handful of other authors I can find (Matte, Buchdahl, Nariai, Taub, Schwinger, Milner, Finkelstein, etc), but overall it's fairly rare to encounter a paper from the 1950's.
Then in the 1960's, the activity picks up, a lot of papers on causal structures, singularities and cosmology pop up. 
Is there a particular set of papers that triggered this renaissance? I can't really think of any really famous paper from the era that would trigger it (the famous papers tended to be more in the middle of this era). 

A:

An influential figure in the later development of general relativity was John Archibald Wheeler (1911-2008). In the academic year 1952/53 he offered a yearlong course on special and general relativity at Princeton (the first such course there). According to Paul Halpern's book cited below, ``among the highlights of the spring session was a class trip on May 16 to Einstein's house (...). There, the eight graduate students in attendance had the unprecedented chance to ask the theory's designer any questions on their minds." Here are some of Wheeler's  papers on general relativity from mid- to late 1950s (the actual list may be longer if he published something in physics journals that were not covered by Mathematical Reviews):

Kruskal's paper mentioned in the comments was written up and submitted on his behalf by Wheeler.  
While it might be difficult to attribute the increase in interest in general relativity to a single paper, there was an important event that influenced later developments. In 1957, a conference on general relativity later known as GR1 was organized by Bryce DeWitt and Cecile Morette DeWitt. According to the report by Peter Bergmann (one of participants) in Reviews of Modern Physics, https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.29.352, one of main inspirations was a quest for developing quantum theory of gravity (still elusive). A readable account can be found in "The quantum labyrinth. How Richard Feynman and John Wheeler  revolutionized time and reality." by Paul Halpern (Basic Books, New York, 2017) and in Feynman's own memoirs.  
The history of general relativity  seems to have followed a more complex path than the `beginning-to-slump-to-golden age' scheme, according to Hubert Goenner in his paper "A golden age of general relativity? Some remarks on the history of general relativity." It is available here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.03319.pdf Some developments and statistics from 1950s that he lists do not seem to support the thesis of there having been ``hardly any paper published" in this decade.
