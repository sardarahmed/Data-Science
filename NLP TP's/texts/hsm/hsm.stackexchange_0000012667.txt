Q:

Why do I , J and K in mechanics represent X , Y and Z in maths?

Why are letters $i$, $j$, and $k$ used for axes names in mechanics while letters $x$ , $y$ and $z$ are used in mathematics?
Why these dimensions weren't called A, B and C or F, G and H?

A:

This usage of $\mathbf i$, $\mathbf j$, and $\mathbf k$ is not specific to physics. It is also used in mathematics, specifically when teaching linear algebra or multivariable calculus in $\mathbf R^3$ as well as group theory for the quaternion group $Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$.
The notation came from the use of the letters $i$, $j$, and $k$ in quaternions, which were created by Hamilton (a physicist). They are a basis of the 3-dimensional space of "pure quaternions" or "imaginary quaternions"  $\{bi + cj + dk : b, c, d, \in \mathbf R\}$, and conjugation on that subspace by all nonzero  quaternions (or just by the unit sphere $S^3$) provides a quaternionic description of proper rotations in 3-dimensional space.  This made the space of pure quaternions a natural model of physical 3-dimensional space on which you could not only add elements but also describe their rotations in a novel (at the time) way through conjugation by a 4-dimensional quaternion.
Hamilton called the pure quaternion part of a quaternion $a+bi+cj+dk$ a “vector” and the real part of a quaternion a "scalar". This was in the 1840s, before linear algebra was well-developed, and this usage by Hamilton is how we got the labels "vector" and “scalar” in linear algebra. Search for vector on this page.
The first group theory paper that mentions the quaternion group is Cayley's 1859 paper, where he writes the elements as
$$
1, \vartheta, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \vartheta\alpha, \vartheta\beta, \vartheta\gamma.
$$
He says it looks simpler if he writes $\vartheta$ as $-1$ and that  $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ "combine according to the laws of the quaternion symbols $i$, $j$, $k$."
In Dedekind's 1897 paper on nonabelian finite groups in which every subgroup is normal ($Q_8$ is the first example), Dedekind did not use the $i, j, k$ notation. He called the group $Q$, not $Q_8$, and wrote $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ instead of $i$, $j$, and $k$, and he wrote $\varepsilon$ instead of $-1$:
$Q = \{1, \varepsilon, \alpha, \varepsilon\alpha, \beta, \varepsilon\beta, \gamma, \varepsilon\gamma\}$.
