Q:

DeMorgan's commentary on Euclid's Elements

Augustus DeMorgan wrote comments on Euclid's Elements, which capture many of the most important points.  Heath quotes them extensively.
I cannot find any source for the original: Where can I see DeMorgan's comments in the original?

A:

De Morgan's "Short Supplementary Remarks on the first Six Books of Euclid's Elements" is contained in the Companion to the (British) Almanac for the year 1849, pp.5â€“20, published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.
