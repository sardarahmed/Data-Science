Q:

Origin / first use of $\mathbb{Z}$ (blackboard bold Z)?

I'm aware that the choice of "Z" comes from German zahlen (for "numbers"); however, I was curious to know when the dedicated font, which I believe is called "blackboard bold" was introduced?
The Wikipedia article on blackboard bold is poorly documented on this point (i.e. specifically the introduction and wide adoption, in print; indeed one of the two links provided in support of their claims is broken). Does anyone have suggestions for a better source on this topic?

A:

Part of @user6530's answer to this related question about the use of Q and $\mathbb{Q}$ for the rationals discussed the use of blackboard bold, so I thought I'd share it, here, for those interested:

Now, some words about Bourbaki. Yes, "they" uses  for rational
numbers, and no, they does not use blackboard bold ℚ (at least in
1940s papers). An early occurence (maybe the earliest printed on
paper) of  to denote the set of rational numbers is here at page 3
in the number 5 (7-10 December 1940) of La Tribu, the Bourbaki's
internal newsletter. We read

 est ordonné [...] Topologie de  [...] Complétion de  : nombres
réels

so there is no doubt that here  refers to our ℚ. Clearly, we find 
for rational numbers in the 1942 Algèbre (from page 29).
