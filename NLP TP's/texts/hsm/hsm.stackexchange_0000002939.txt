Q:

Who discovered the Rayleigh-Taylor instability?

Who discovered the Rayleigh-Taylor instability? Was it artist David Alfaro Siquerios? Or was he the first to observe it?

A:

Rayleigh published his findings in 1883. Siqueiros (thus, not "Siquerios") was born in 1896. Does that answer your question?
