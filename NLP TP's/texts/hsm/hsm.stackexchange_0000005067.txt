Q:

Lise Meitner's contribution to this experimental apparatus and research effort?

I am reading a NYTimes obituary of Otto Hahn and the discovery of fission, and I've asked in physics SE about the function of the apparatus shown in that article.
The system shown demonstrated the ability to induced fission by neutrons. This answer to the linked question links to this IAEA article which explains much more.
In my question I'm not certain how to attribute the development of the apparatus itself. I'd like to get the facts right so I can word the attribution correctly. I understand that Lise Meitner was involved generally, and dismissed for (most likely) being Jewish. What are the details here? How should I attribute this experimental apparatus and effort?
