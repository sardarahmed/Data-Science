Q:

What would happen if an Enigma machine's plugboard were used to map a letter to itself?

A famous characteristic of the Enigma machine was that its rotor design ensured/required that no letter ever map to itself. However, there was a plugboard on the front that could swap letter pairs. So let's say the machine were in a state where pressing A would make B light up. What would happen in that case if a plugboard connection were added swapping A and B?

A:

In Enigma the wires followed from keyboard through rotors, then through plugboard, then back through the same rotors to lamps with letters. The resulting permutation would be (rotors)(plugboard)(rotors$^{-1}$). So you can't just swap A and B.
