Q:

Does an English translation of Bombelli's L'Algebra exist?

I'm looking for an English translation of Rafael Bombelli's L'Algebra.  From what I can tell after having searched the usual corners of the web, it doesn't exist, but I'm asking here just in case.
I'm particularly interested in his analysis of Cardano/Tartaglia/Ferro's methods for cubics and how they relate to complex numbers, so if there's a decently comprehensive history book covering that, that might be suitable. (For whatever it's worth, I currently have C. Boyer's A History of Mathematics and P. Nahin's An Imaginary Tale, but I'm looking for something a little more focused to accompany those.)

A:

González-Velasco (2011) has a nice dozen pages on L’Algebra (§3.3). His preface (p. x) says there has been no translation.
