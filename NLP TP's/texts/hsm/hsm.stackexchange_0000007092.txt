Q:

Wavelength definition of the metre

Between 1960 and 1983 the metre was defined as being equal to 1 650 763.73 wavelengths of an orange emission line of krypton-86. How did they actually use that definition? Was it possible to move the mirror of an interferometer slowly over a distance of 1 metre, perhaps by a very smooth screw, and count the appearance of 1.6 million fringes without mistakes? Was the coherence length of the krypton light more than 1 metre?

A:

There are much easier ways to measure a wavelength than by "tromboning" an interferometer.  A simple two-slit grating, for example, will give you a pretty decent measurement.    You don't need to measure a "meter's worth" of light, just run an experiment where the output data (such as a diffraction pattern) can be used to calculate the wavelength to high precision and accuracy. 
In any case, the definition was basically "in reverse." Using existing measurement techniques, NIST or ISO or whomever took the current measurement of this narrow (no broadening, no fine-structure splitting) line and used that to define the meter.
