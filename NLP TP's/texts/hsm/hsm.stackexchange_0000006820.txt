Q:

Invalid mathematical proof that was considered valid for the longest period of time?

Sometimes, mathematical proofs accepted in the scientific community are found to be wrong. 
What is  the disproved proof that was believed to be correct for the longest period of time?
clarification: Note that I'm asking only about proofs where the result itself turned out to be false.

A:

In 1923 Henri Dulac published a solution of Hilbert problem 16, second part.
This was accepted, he received a prize of the French academy, and the problem was considered solved until a gap in the proof was found by Ilyashenko in 1982.
It took about 10 years to fill the gap (Ilyashenko and Ecalle, independently, 1992). 1982-1923=59, so for 59 years the fact was believed to be proven while it was not. This is the longest example that I know.
