Q:

When did mathematicians invent the unit circle to extend the trig functions?

Is there any evidence showing that a unit circle approach was used by early mathematicians?

A:

The modern convention, like much of modern notation, goes back to Euler's Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum (1748), chapter VIII, there is an English translation by Blanton. The unit circle was not invented to extend trigonometric functions, power series already accomplished that even for complex values, it was rather an illustrative device. At the beginning of the chapter Euler writes:

"After having considered logarithms and exponentials, we must now
turn to circular arcs with their sines and cosines. This is not only because these
are further genera of transcendental quantities, but also since they arise from logarithms
and exponentials when complex values are used. This will become
clearer in the development to follow.
We let the radius, or total sine, of a circle be equal to 1, then it is clear
enough that the circumference of the circle cannot be expressed exactly as a
rational number."

He then denotes half of the circumference by the familiar $\pi$, and gives the standard suite of trig identities.
