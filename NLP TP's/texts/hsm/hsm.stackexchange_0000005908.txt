Q:

What is the first usage of the term "Adjoint" and why was this word chosen?

The term "Adjoint" appears in many different mathematical areas and for sometimes seemingly different kinds of things.  Wikipedia says --  "In mathematics, the term adjoint applies in several situations.  Several of these share a similar formalism:  if $A$ is adjoint to $B$, then there is typically some formula of the type"
$$
\left( A x, y \right) = \left(x, B y\right)
$$
Also, Wikipedia goes on to give examples and a few of them I repeat here:

Hermitian Adjoint of a Linear Operator
Adjoint Equation (as used in Differential Operators)
Adjoint Matrix

And, there are other examples.
My question is about how and where was this term chosen.  Better yet, who was first to start using it.  Every time I see this word in a text or paper I am always thinking "There has to be a better more descriptive term to use".

Jeff Miller's very valuable collection of the origins of mathematical expressions has the entries adjoint equation (Lagrange), adjoint linear form (Cayley) and adjoint matrix (Bocher): http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html
