Q:

Electromagnetic constants and the speed of light

Was it known before Maxwell's time that the vacuum permitivity was inversely related to the permeability by a factor of $c^2$?

A:

The relation of the speed of light $c$ to electrodynamics was known before Maxwell.
In 1846, Weber derived his force law between point charges:1
$$F=\frac{ee'}{r^2}\left[1-\frac{1}{2c^2}\left(\frac{dr}{dt}\right)^2+\frac{1}{c^2}r\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}\right]$$
from Ampère's force law2 (not to be confused with one of Maxwell's equations, the Ampère circuital law) between current elements  (written in modern vector notations and with modern units):
$$d^2\vec{F_{21}^A} = - \frac{\mu _0 }{4\pi }I_1 I_2 \frac{\hat {r}_{12} }{r_{12}^2 }\left[2(d\vec {\ell }_1 \cdot d\vec {\ell }_2) - 3({\hat {r}_{12} \cdot d\vec {\ell }_1 })({\hat {r}_{12} \cdot d\vec {\ell }_2 })\right] = - d^2\vec{F_{12}^A}.$$
In the form Weber wrote his law, it involved a constant $a$ that is related to the speed of light $c$ by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.
In 1856, Kohlrausch & Weber experimentally determined the constant.3
In 1857, Kirchoff explicitly tied this constant to the propagation of electricity in a wire:4

The velocity of propagation of an electric wave is here equal to $\frac{c}{\sqrt{2}}$; it is therefore independent of the cross-section of the wire, of its conductivity, and, finally, of the electric density; […] it is thus very near the speed of light in empty space.

See Assis's Weber's Electrodynamics and ch. 8 of Duhem's The Electric Theories of J. Clerk Maxwell: A Historical and Critical Study.
Also, this is a good historical overview:
