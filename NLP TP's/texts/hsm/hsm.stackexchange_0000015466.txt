Q:

Have all of Euler's works been translated?

I am interested in reading Euler's works.
The Euler Archive contains some translated works but not all of them. I am just checking here to see if anyone know a complete translation of all of Euler's works.
Preferably in HTML format.

A:

No, not all. I don't think that they are even all published in the original language. There is an ongoing project of translating Euler's mathematical work (only mathematical)
Euler archive and you can see there which works are translated.
But if you want to read Euler in English, enough of his papers are already translated in this project to keep you busy for years.

A:

If you are interested in reading Euler in English translation, you should take a look at Ian Bruce's excellent web site https://www.17centurymaths.com. His project involves the translation of mathematical works of the 17th and 18th century from Latin to English, and many of Euler's works are available. Bruce's work is a great contribution to the mathematics community.
