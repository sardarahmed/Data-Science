Q:

Why doesn't Morse code try to achieve more compression?

I was working on the Morse code Wikipedia article , when I noticed something strange.

There might be a reason, but I can't find it.
As you can see, the code symbol ...-. is not used, however the code symbol ----- is. Why?
The first symbol is shorter (11) than the second one (19).

This is not the only code symbol unused.

A:

Three possible reasons:

...-. is used by a prosign meaning understood;
using ----- for the digit 0 makes the encoding of digits regular, thus easier to memorize;
----- for the digit 0 could be replaced by the shorter --- for the letter O, in contexts where it is clear that a digit is thought.

I conjecture that 2 is the historical reason.

A:

Morse code was defined by Morse himself, and later (somewhat) extended. Using letter frequency for dense coding was a consideration (. for the commonest letter e, and on down), trying to make it easy to learn clearly was a goal, and (some) resistance to garbling; but all this happened long before Shannon's study of communication or any systematic study of coding, error detection and such.
