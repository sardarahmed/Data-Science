Q:

Need quote from early 20th century about humanity probably never being able to control (manipulate, see?) a single quantum system

I remember having read a statement, I think by one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, that we will probably never be able to control (or manipulate or see or isolate...?) a single quantum system (or atom).
The quote was used to highlight the fast progress experimental quantum physics has made over the last few decades (seeing that single-particle control is routinely achieved in experiments).
Does anyone know the quote and its source?

A:

Found it:
"[...] we never experiment with just one electron or atom or (small) molecule. In thought-experiments we sometimes assume that we do; this invariably entails ridiculous consequences [...]"
