Q:

Biography on Georg Cantor

I am looking for biographical works about Georg Cantor's life.
All I have found right now are short encyclopedia-style articles that skim the important points of his life or works mainly focused on his mathematical contributions; ideally I want something more thorough that has a greater emphasis on his life in general rather than just his mathematical contributions. I came across this book, 'Georg Cantor: Leben, Werk und Wirkung' by Herbert Meschkowski, that seems to be what I'm looking for, but unfortunately I haven't found a copy yet.
I would prefer books, but any other references (papers, websites, etc.) that you'd think would be interesting or useful are very much appreciated.

A:

As pointed out in the comments on Math Stack Exchange, Dauben's book is highly regarded.  For reference, here's a link to the Dauben book review published in the Bulletin of the AMS.
