Q:

Notational change with Integrals

A little over 50 years ago I took my first Calculus class and learned the conventional form of an integral as:
$$
\int f(x)\,\, \textrm{d}x
$$
That is, the integral sign (definite or indefinite) followed by the function being integrated followed by the integration variable as $\textrm{d}x$ (in this example).
However, during retirement I decided a self-teaching adventure into Quantum Field Theory and also General Relativity and other topics of mathematical physics.  Reading many different papers and text books on these subjects I find a lot of authors using this variation of the integral:
$$
\int \textrm{d}x\,\,f(x) 
$$
Where the integral sign is immediately followed by designating the variables to be integrated.  Other examples include:
$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\textrm{d}^4q\,\,\mathcal{L}(\phi,\dot{\phi}\,;t)
$$
For the action integral of a field described by Lagrangian Density function or an example from General Relativity,
$$
S=\int \textrm{d}^4 x\sqrt{-g}\,\,g^{\mu \nu}\,\,R_{\mu \nu}\,(\,\Gamma\,)
$$
Now that I am used to seeing and using this notation, I much prefer it over the notation I learned in Calculus classes and have used ever since in work and play.  I like the idea of seeing the integral, its limits, and the variables of integration all described at once before considering the function to be integrated.
My question, is this notation recognized by others, in particular mathematicians as I myself have only seen it used in various papers and texts of topics in mathematical physics.  Also, who used it first and were they motivated by the same idea that I personally find as an improvement -- that is, it just reads better.

A:

Calculus was originally formulated in terms of infinitesimals. Hundreds of years later, a second formulation was found in terms of limits. There were originally some doubts about whether the version using infinitesimals was logically OK, but these doubts were cleared up by Robinson and others ca. 1961.
The Leibniz notation $\int f(x) dx$ was invented in the earlier period, so in this notation, $dx$ a notation for an infinitesimal. You can imagine a Riemann sum with the narrow rectangles having an infinitesimal width $dx$. The thing inside the integral sign is the width of one such rectangle: its height $f(x)$ multiplied by its width $dx$. Since multiplication is commutative, we have literally $f(x)dx=dxf(x)$.
Some math teachers today still tell their students that the $dx$ is just punctuation, or only functionsas a statement of what variable is being integrated with respect to. This could be because they are afraid their students will be confused by talk about infinitesimals, or because the teachers themselves don't know that any concerns about the logical issues with infinitesimals have been cleared up.

The notation was first used by Leibniz, with the factors written in whichever  order was convenient. It is universally recognized, with the factors in either order, by people who understand the above historical and mathematical facts.
