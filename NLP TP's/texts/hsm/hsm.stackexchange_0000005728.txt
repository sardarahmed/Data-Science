Q:

Old textbooks on statistical mechanics

I am going to teach history of physics next semester. Can anyone name some old textbooks on statistical mechanics? By old, I mean written around 1930 or earlier. I would like to compare the old books and the books nowadays. 

A:

Arnold Sommerfeld's last volume of his Lectures on Theoretical Physics, written in the 1940s and published posthumously, downloadable as pdf file
Max Planck's Theory of
Heat from 1932
The 1911 article by Paul and Tatiana Ehrenfest in Felix Klein's Encyklop√§die, of which there is also an English translation
And here is a host of other books:
