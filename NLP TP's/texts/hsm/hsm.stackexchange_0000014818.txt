Where is Alfred Tarski buried?

Where is Alfred Tarski buried?
He was a famous Polish mathematician. He died in 1983 in Berkeley, California, USA, according to Wikipedia. I tried a search on Find a Grave, but there is no entry for his name. I also tried a multilingual search. Thank you.

A:

Not buried, cremated. The urn with his ashes is in a columbarium in Oakland, if I remember correctly - I visited the place in 1990s with his son Jan.
