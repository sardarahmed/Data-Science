Q:

Where can I find the historical information or the stats related to Winning WW2 with the minimum actions using The Bombe Machine of Alan Turing?

I am doing a marathon of data visualizations with real world datasets. I am interested in historical war datasets.
Does anybody know about the historical data on The Bombe Machine cracking the codes of enigma and how did the "minimization actions" of the machine were used to avoid Nazi to realize what was happening and why they were losing the battles?

A:

One of the best authoritative sources regarding the use of the Bombe and methods to determine most efficient settings for the Bombe for decoding, is given in the following source:
HUGH SEBAG-MONTEFIORE
Enigma: The Battle for the Code
John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated
April 2001
448 Pages
ISBN:   0471407380
ISBN13: 9780471407386
Several editions of this book are available electronically here.  Because the Bombe was ultimately arrayed, the source will provide insight into the processes used.  The whole of activity at Bletchley Park was a mathematical and statistical-probabilistic tour de force.  This book may not answer all of your questions, but the appendices give excellent insights into the methods used. Be advised: The book is directed toward an audience of general interests, not specifically toward persons with a mathematics background. You may have already reviewed this book.
