Q:

Identification of Rare Newton Statue

I'm not sure where else to post this. No matter how inventive my Google searches, I am unable to locate an active webpage containing this rare statue of Isaac Newton that I stored on my computer a number of years ago. Can anybody identify information about this statue?

A:

Perhaps this is a lead:  I found an article which includes the following text [emphasis mine] .

The campus of Broad Group in Changsha was designed to reflect Zhang
Yue’s eclectic influences and his passion for the environment. It
encompasses a sprawling organic garden that provides up to half of the
food consumed by his workers, and the grounds are dotted with dozens
of statues of inspirational figures, from Confucius and the poet Li
Bai to Coco Chanel and Jack Welch. There are likenesses of
environmentalist Rachel Carson, Sir Isaac Newton with an apple about
to fall on his head, and Winston Churchill flashing a V for Victory
sign. One company building is modeled after the palace at Versailles,
another after an Egyptian pyramid.

Following up on Carl Witthoft's lead, I found another image at this link.  To locate the image, you can search the page for the text "第五章：科技筑梦" to avoid lots of scrolling. The image, shown below, provides the full background text:
没有大胆的猜测
就没有伟大的发现
(paraphrasing google translate, this comes out to: "Without bold guesses, there is no great discovery")
