Q:

Where can I learn more about lesser known mathematicians?

I'm reaching the point in my mathematical career that the names aren't so well known. Everybody knows that Euler was great and Gauss was even better, and it's not hard to learn that if Riemann died too young, then Abel died when he was only 26.
Anyway, there's a lot of things named after a lot of people, and my education just feels incomplete without knowing who these people are and what they were up to. Is there such a thing as an anthology or maybe a good MOOC I can look at in my spare time?

A:

There is a large list of links to biographies here. Most mathematicians on the list are not as well known as Gauss and Euler, and they link to MacTutor, which is more reliable than Wikipedia.
