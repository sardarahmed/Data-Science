Q:

Are there any well known mathematicians who were fascists?

I only recently learned that Pascual Jordan, a well known physicist, with significant contributions to the development of early quantum mechanics was a paid up member of the Nazi Party. He in fact joined a SA unit.
Are there any well-known mathematicians who were fascist or Nazi?

A:

The book Mathematicians Under the Nazis by Segal is a systematic study of, well, what it says in the title. It includes several examples of mathematicians who showed various degrees of sympathy for the Nazis. This includes Gentzen, Vahlen, Bieberbach and KÃ¤hler.

A:

Probably the most famous mathematicians who were  members of NSDAP are Oswald Teichmuller and
Ludwig Bieberbach.
