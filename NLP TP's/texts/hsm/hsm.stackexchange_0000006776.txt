Q:

The Origin of the Jacobian

In what work did Jacobi introduce the jacobian, and what was his motivation for doing so?

A:

I don't know about the motivation, but it was introduced in his article Ueber die Functionaldeterminanten (Journal f√ºr die reine und angewandte mathematik, bd. 22, 1841). However, Jacobians had already been studied by Cauchy in 1815.
