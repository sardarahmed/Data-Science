Q:

Why and who was the first to denote the square root operation in fractional form as $1/2$

Basically, the square root operation was discovered and proved rigorously from the Pythagorean theorem, it was denoted by square root of a rational number say $n$ as $\sqrt{n}$, but at a later stage, it used to be denoted by fractional power equals to $1/2$, also for multi-square root operation for say a prime number $p$ as $\sqrt[2^{n}]{p}$ or $p^{2^{- n}}$, for some positive integer $n$, and then this was so generalized to any fraction number 
But, the power or exponent operation was basically defined for positive integer numbers, where the number of using the multiplication operation is basically a natural number such that it makes sense, and this was simply generalised to a ricipricical or the inverse of the integer number of power operation to be extended to negative integers 
To illustrate that simply in examples for say $n^3 = n*n*n$, so we used the multiplication operation twice which is an integer number of times
And generally, we use the multiplication operation as ($k - 1$) times, to express a power integer $n^k$ for $k$ positive integer 
But what does it mean when the exponent provided is a fraction number in accordance with the sensible basic definition of power integer?    
Does that mean that an integer is multiplied by itself a fractional number of times? which seems meaningless

A:

Nicole d'Oresme was the first to use fractional exponents. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme
In Algorismus proportionum and De proportionibus proportionum, Oresme developed the first calculation-method of powers with fractional irrational exponents.

The exponent 1/2 means that the square root of $x$ has to be multiplied by itself in order to give $x$.
