Q:

Books or articles criticizing Benoit Mandelbrot? (fractals)

I'm researching about fractals history and one of its main contributor and promoter Benoit Mandelbrot.
As far as I'm concerned, when he published his first book about this subject in 1975, he was severely criticized and questioned. Later, as he published more books and expanded this subject, he started to get accepted by most mathematicians.  
Where could I find proofs about the first?
For example, any book or science / math magazine of the time criticizing him (or similar). 

A:

This may not be quite what you seek, but there is a good review of The Fractalist by Brian Hayes in The American Scientist (link).
He mentions the "feud" with Herbert Simon:

What’s not so endearing is to see some of the supporting actors denied even a listing in the credits. For example, Mandelbrot carried on a bitter public feud with the economist and computer scientist Herbert Simon. For six years they traded critiques and replies, final notes and postscripts to final notes in the pages of Information and Control. The incident is mentioned in The Fractalist, but Simon goes unnamed; Mandelbrot refers to him as “a loud opponent of mine.” It could be worse, I suppose. Instead of ignoring Simon, Mandelbrot might have taken one last swipe at him—a postscript to the postscript.
