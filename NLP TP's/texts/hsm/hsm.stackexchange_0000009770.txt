Q:

What are some of the unsolved mathematical problems posed and stated clearly prior to the year 1900?

I chose year 1900 because of:
"Hilbert's problems are twenty-three problems in mathematics published by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900. The problems were all unsolved at the time, and several of them were very influential for 20th-century mathematics. Hilbert presented ten of the problems (1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 21, and 22) at the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians, speaking on August 8 in the Sorbonne. The complete list of 23 problems was published later, most notably in English translation in 1902 by Mary Frances Winston Newson in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society."
I know about some of them, to mention:
1) Legendre´s conjecture
2) Polignac´s conjecture
3) Bunyakovsky conjecture
4) Riemann hypothesis
5) Are there any odd perfect numbers?
6) Goldbach's conjecture
7) Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes?
8) Brocard's problem
But, I am not so sure is there a huge number of mathematical unsolved problems posed prior to the year 1900 or just a "few" of them?
Can you list some of them in your answer?

A:

Turns out this is discussed in detail over at MathOverflow.   I'm in no way educated enough in this field to comment further, other than to mention that the top answer there states it's "Existence or nonexistence of odd perfect numbers," dating from Nicomachus of Gerasa around 100 AD.
