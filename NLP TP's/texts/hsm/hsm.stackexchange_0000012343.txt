Q:

Cosmic microwave background and "white dielectric"

Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson were awarded (one half of) the 1978 Nobel prize in Physics, "for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation",
https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1978/summary/
The story about their discovery is usually told with an anecdote about the pigeon droppings (allegedly described by Penzias as a "white dielectric") in their horn antenna, which was a cause of unwanted noise. I cannot find the origin of this story, presumably told by Penzias himself. Was this part of some interview or does it appear somewhere in a published (paper) form?

A:

Wilson tells the story in his Nobel lecture of 1978:

Thus we seemed to be left with the antenna as the source of our extra
noise. We calculated a contribution of $0.9 \text{K}$ from its resistive loss using
standard waveguide theory. The most lossy part of the antenna was its
small diameter throat, which was made of electroformed copper. We had
measured similar waveguides in the lab and corrected the loss calculations
for the imperfect surface conditions we had found in those waveguides.
The remainder of the antenna was made of riveted aluminum sheets, and
although we did not expect any trouble there, we had no way to evaluate
the loss in the riveted joints. A pair of pigeons was roosting up in the small
part of the horn where it enters the warm cab. They had covered the inside
with a white material familiar to all city dwellers. We evicted the pigeons
and cleaned up their mess, but obtained only a small reduction in antenna
temperature.
