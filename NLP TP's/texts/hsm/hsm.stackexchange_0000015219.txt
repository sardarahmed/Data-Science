Origin of Riemann-Stieltjes Integral

What need (if there was any) created Riemann-Stieltjes integral? What did Riemann-Stieltjes integral want to attain?

A:

The Riemann-Stieljes was introduced by Thomas Stieltjes in his long paper (or book) on continued fractions,
Recherches sur les fractions continues,
Mém. Sav. étr. 32, Nr. 2, 197 S. (1904).
The purpose was to unify the treatment of of continuous and discrete measures in his theory of moments.

A:

An important use of the Stieltjes integral, after its creation by Stieltjes, was its use by Riesz in $1909$ to describe the continuous dual space of $C([0,1])$, the space of real-valued continuous functions $[0,1] \to \mathbf R$ equipped with the sup-norm. Riesz showed the  elements of the dual space are Stieltjes integrals $f \mapsto \int_0^1  f(x)d\alpha(x)$ where $\alpha$ has bounded variation. This result was later absorbed into general measure theory: the dual space of the continuous real-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space $X$ consists of integration of continuous functions on $X$ with respect to different Radon measures.
Mike Bertrand's website has an account of Riesz's argument here and a copy of Riesz's  article here.
