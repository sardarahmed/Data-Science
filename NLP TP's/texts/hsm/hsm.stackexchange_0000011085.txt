Q:

When did the term 'scientist, physicist, science, physicist' come in use?

Down to the eighteenth century physics was called philosophia naturalis.
When were the terms Physics, Science and Scientist, introduced?  By whom?  When did they supplant the old ones?

A:

I looked in the Oxford English Dictionary (subscription required) for English usages.
physics used in the medical sense, I do not report on.  

physics used for "natural science" in general:  The oldest instance they have is from 1487.  

J. Skelton tr. Diodorus Siculus Bibliotheca Historica iii. 174   Among the Grekes, as it is many tymes seen, it is long or they can atteigne vnto thentellective of the phisikes [L. philosophiam, Gk. ϕιλοσοϕίας] by-cause they long perseuere not therin, but geve theym vnto lucrative science.

He uses "phisikes" to translate Latin "philosophiam" and Greek "ϕιλοσοϕίας".

physics used in the more modern sense: The oldest instance they have is from 1715.

tr. D. Gregory Elements Astron. I. Pref. ii   The Celestial Physics, or Physical Astronomy [L. Astronomia Physica], is not only the first in dignity of all inquiries into Nature whatever.

He uses "Celestial Physics" to translate the Latin "Astronomia Physica".

science  Various obsolete, archaic, and rare usages I do not report on.

science paired or contrasted with art:  The oldest instance they have is from 1387.

J. Trevisa tr. R. Higden Polychron. (St. John's Cambr.) (1879) VII. 69 (MED)   He..fliȝ into..Spayne, forto lerne curious and sotil artes and sciens þere.

science in a more modern sense: there is this definition from 1600

W. Vaughan Golden-groue i. lxv. sig. Mv   The name of science is taken more strictly for a habit gotten by demonstration separated from wisedome; in which last signification Naturall philosophy, & the Mathematickes are called Sciences.

So: what had formerly been called "Naturall philosophy" and "Mathematickes" are now called "Sciences".
