Q:

Why is Dirac delta named after Dirac when the concept was already over two centuries old?

Please explain why the Dirac delta function was named after Dirac, who lived in the 20th century, and what was so special about it.
I ask this because it is used in Green's function which pre-dated Dirac by 200 years.  I find Green's function more insightful and so wonder why it is not called Green's delta.  Fourier and Cauchy are also  cited on the Wikipedia page for the Dirac delta as having used the impulse concept.
I am therefore hoping to find out what Dirac's special contribution was since the maths was already two centuries old.  I don't see this contribution on the Wikipedia page even though its implicitly referred to as Dirac's invention.

A:

It's because of Diracs use of it in QM. After QM was a revolutionary new theory of physics and so had immense visibility because of this.
This is very similar to how Einstein popularised the study of non-Euclidean geometry by his use of such in his revolutionary theory of space and time. After all, non-Euclidean geometry had been known since Gauss's time but it simply didn't have the glamour or cachet that it began to have once Einstein arrived on the scene.
