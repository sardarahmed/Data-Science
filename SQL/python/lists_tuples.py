#Lists and Tuples

#Lists
#Lists are mutable, meaning that you can change the values of the elements in a list after the list has been created.
#Lists are created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets [], separated by commas.
#It is possible to have a list with no elements, which is called an empty list.
#Lists are ordered, meaning that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
#Lists allow duplicate values.
#Lists are changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
#List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
