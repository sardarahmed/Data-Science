Q:

mapviz - missing multi-res-image and tile-map plugins

I'm trying to use mapviz to plot the location of a robot on a geo-referenced map. The multi-res-image plugin for mapviz seems perfect for my application but when I click add the options are missing for multi-res-image and tile map.
I installed using apt-get like so sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-mapviz ros-indigo-mapviz-plugins
I'm using ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04.
Should I try installing from source?
