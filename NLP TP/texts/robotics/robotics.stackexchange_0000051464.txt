Q:

new to open source

Hi Just wrapping up a C/C++ certificate program at UCSD.  I would like to get involved with the ROS project.  I have started looking over the Get Involved pages and the Hand Off list.
I have never worked on an open source project before.  I would like to start out by testing and fixing bugs.  Can anyone outline which actual steps I need to take to get started.  I am looking over the above pages but it still seems a bit general as far as what I need to do to start out.
I know I need to download a stack, but which sections do I need to follow in order to check in the code etc,  Is the code referenced from the github site I create?  I do not need any handholding just an outline on the important sections to follow.
Thanks
Joe

A:

First, I'd say you'll want to spend a LOT of time setting up and using the software so you know its operation very well. Once you feel you are really ready to contribute via testing, bug fixes etc you might want to look at these resources,

http://www.ros.org/wiki/Get%20Involved/Handoff%20List
While for some of the newest happenings in the ROS community have a look here,

Hope that helps.
