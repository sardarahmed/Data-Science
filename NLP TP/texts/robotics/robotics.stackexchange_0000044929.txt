Q:

erratic simulator gazebo does not work anymore

I tried erratic simulation some months ago and it worked, but now it does not work anymore. If I launch "roslaunch erratic_description erratic_empty_world.launch", gazebo gui starts without the robot and it seems blocked on:

waiting for service /gazebo/spawn_urdf_model

The gzserver process consumes a lot of CPU (100%), but I do not know if it is related.
I tried also on another computer with the same results.
I have Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and fuerte.
Does someone have an advice to solve the problem?
Thanks.
Update. I did another test. The erratic_empty_world.launch file is:
<launch>
<param name="/use_sim_time" value="true" />

<node name="empty_world_server"
      pkg="gazebo"
      type="gazebo"
      args="-u $(find gazebo_worlds)/worlds/empty.world"
      respawn="false"
      output="screen"/>

<node name="gazebo_gui" pkg="gazebo" type="gui" respawn="false" output="screen"/>

<include file="$(find erratic_description)/launch/erratic_mobile_base.launch" />

I tried to run each node separately with 4 commands: roscore, rosrun gazebo gazebo empty.world, rosrun gazebo gui, roslaunch erratic_description erratic_mobile_base.launch.
and it worked. The general erratic_empty_world.launch file should do the same, but it does not work. Any suggestions?

A:

Just change the node name from node "empty_world_server" to "gazebo" and it should be able to find the /gazebo/spawn_urdf_model service and the rest of them.

Thanks now it works!! But why some months ago did it work? Is it changed? I thought that "name" was a customizable field.
