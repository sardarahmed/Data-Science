Q:

Is it possible to load the parameters file while running?

Is it possible to load a parameter yaml file during runtime?
I have multiple parameter files that I would like to switch parameter file while running.
For example, I have

setting1.yaml
setting2.yaml

and at startup, setting1.yaml is loaded.
(This can be configured in launch.py)
After that, I want to load setting2.yaml and apply parameters while running.
The ros2 version is eloquent.
I am using jetson and jetson's OS(Jetpack) is based on ubuntu18.04 so I cannot use foxy.
In the foxy manual, I found the following section.

6 ros2 param load You can load

parameters from a file to a currently running node using the command:

ros2 param load <node_name> <parameter_file>

https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Parameters/Understanding-ROS2-Parameters.html#ros2-param-load
However, there is no mention of this in the eloquent manual, and in fact the command resulted in an error.
https://docs.ros.org/en/eloquent/Tutorials/Parameters/Understanding-ROS2-Parameters.html
Any advice would be appreciated.

A:

Found this in the eloquent documentation:
https://docs.ros.org/en/eloquent/Tutorials/Parameters/Understanding-ROS2-Parameters.html#load-parameter-file
ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name> --ros-args --params-file <file_name>

Thank you for your answer.
What I want to know is how to reload the parameter file during runtime, but the method you suggested is seems to how to read the parameter file at the start.

In eloquent you need to stop node and reload as explained in the example.

If you need this functionality you could start PR, this feature was introduced for Galactic but recently added to foxy: https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli/pull/596

Thank you osilva.
I understood that eloquent does not have the feature I'm looking for.
