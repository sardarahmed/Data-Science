Q:

How long to release an updated Debian?

Hi,
I released a package recently that had some errors ('pid' package v0.0.1). So I fixed the errors and made another pull request which was merged with ros:master. It was merged about two weeks ago. However, if I do 'sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pid', it still installs v0.0.1... the broken version. Have I done anything wrong or does it just take awhile to update the debians?
Some interesting tidbits... the build status page shows the right version (v0.0.3):
http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html
And I got an email recently about "Jenkins build is back to normal." Not sure what that's all about.

Thanks!

A:

Your package is staged in the testing repo.
If you look at the debbuild status page you'll see the new version is in 2 of 3 of the repos. http://www.ros.org/debbuild/indigo.html?q=pid
It's in the testing repository at the moment. Documented here: http://wiki.ros.org/ShadowRepository
About every 2 weeks the packages are synced from ros-shadow-fixed to public. That is when the announcement will got out to ROS-users@ like this
The 2 week timeline is nominal. Sometimes the cycle is longer, sometimes shorter. Issues relating to the release timeline should be discussed on ros-release@
