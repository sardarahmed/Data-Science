Q:

Gazebo crashes when opening some example models

Hi all!
I'm new to Gazebo and I'm running version 1.0.1 (after compiling from tarball) on a 64-bit Debian Wheezy standard installation.
I'm able to launch successfully Gazebo and do some simulations; however, when I try to open some example models bundled with the program, Gazebo crashes.
Here follows an example.
When I try to open "cube_20k.model" I get the following output:
Msg Connected to gazebo master @ http://localhost:11345
Error [RenderEngine.cc:356] Unable to load Ogre Plugin[/usr/lib/OGRE/Plugin_CgProgramManager.so]...Skipping.

Warning [parser.cc:247] parsing using deprecated world file failed trying old model format.
Error [parser.cc:253] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
Dbg Unable to find element with name[model] return empty
Segmentation Fault

I get a similar behavior with many other model files, included the one used as example in the Wiki:
http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Gazebo_models .
Moreover, strangely some much more complex models like "pr2.model" or "kitchen.model" load and simulate successfully.
What is my error?

Hello,
I highly recommend upgrading to Gazebo 1.2.5. It is infinitely more stable.
The install process is also simplified, and will make upgrading much easier in the future.
