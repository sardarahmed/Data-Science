A:

That package has been released recently so is not available in the main repository. It will be on the next package sync (happens ~ every month).
In the meantime you can either:
install it from the testing repository:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] http://packages.ros.org/ros2-testing/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-testing.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-eloquent-costmap-converter-msgs

Or build it from source:
mkdir -p ~/costmap_converter_ws/src && cd ~/costmap_converter_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/costmap_converter -b ros2
cd ~/costmap_converter_ws/
colcon build --packages-select costmap_converter_msgs
