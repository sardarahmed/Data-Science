Do you have a USB 3.0 interface, by any chance?

I faced a similar problem. The new sensors of xtion pro live work with openni2. whereas openni_launch is based on openni. You can use https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni2_launch.git with catkin

A:

Probably too late to answer, I have tried running rgbdslam with Asus Xtion Pro and it works far better that Kinect. As mentioned above, Asus Xtion Pro uses openni2 libraries. You have the latest repository here. You can find help in using Asus Xtion pro in rgbdslam from my blog here(Ubuntu depth camera test) and here(ROS Installation).
