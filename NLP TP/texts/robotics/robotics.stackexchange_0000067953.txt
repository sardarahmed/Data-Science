Q:

2D point to 3D transformation(using Kinect) programmed by openCV

enter code here I am working on something related to 2D point to 3D transformation, which is new to me. Could anyone provide me an outline about doing this? better with explanation. Thank you!

I solved this problem.
1. read rgb image and depth image from kinect approximately, using http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters/ApproximateTime.
2. get the formula to calculate the value(x,y) from rgb image and z from depth image into 3D point.x, point.y, point.z

A:

I recommend taking a look at the /tf wiki page and learning how the ROS handles transforms.  You can also take a look at this paper to learn a bit more detail than the wiki page provides.
Finally, you can take a look at Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots by Roland Siegwart and Illah R. Nourbakhsh.
