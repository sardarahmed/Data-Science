Q:

What is the difference between a Plugin and a Sensor

Hello all,
In http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.4/using_the_ros_plugins it says that "The imu sensor and the imu plugin are different because the ros plugin use a model plugin and not a sensor plugin."
What exactly is different between a plugin and a sensor? Can't we create camera plugin or camera sensor with the same behavior?
Thanks

A:

A sensor processes some aspect of simulation and outputs formatted data. For example, a camera sensor renders the scene and outputs an image.
There are many different kinds of plugins including:
1. Model: Controls a model
2. World: Controls the world 
3. System: Control load and unloading of the whole system
4. Sensor: Can be used to modify sensor behavior. This type of plugin can be used to add noise to a sensor stream, or make sensor output match a particular sensor model (such as a Hokuyo Laser)
