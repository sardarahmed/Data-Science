Q:

The plugin SkidSteerDrivePlugin did not work on pioneer3at model in gazebo 5

Hi,all:
I added the plugin in pioneer3at model like this:
   <model name='pioneer3at'>
      ...
      <static>0</static>
      ...
      <plugin name='SkidSteerDrivePlugin' filename='libSkidSteerDrivePlugin.so'>
        <right_front>right_front</right_front>
        <right_rear>right_rear</right_rear>
        <left_front>left_front</left_front>
        <left_rear>left_rear</left_rear>
        <MaxForce>5.0</MaxForce>
      </plugin>
    </model>

But when I run the gazebo and then publish topic'~/pioneer3at/vel_cmd' using rqt_gui, the pioneer did not move.Also, any possible topic name has been tried.
Anyone know why the pioneer did not move?

A:

Using rqt_gui, you're probably trying to publish to ROS topics, rather than Gazebo topics, which is what your plugin is subscribed to.
You can check the list of Gazebo topics with active publishers/subscribers with gz topic -l, and the list of ROS topics with rostopic list.
You can try writing a Gazebo publisher like this.
