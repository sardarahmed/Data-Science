Q:

How to get Qhull PyHull on Mac OS Sierra

I am installing ROS on Mac (I know, its unsupported, but I have to try). The instructions are really good and complete for something this complex, I have to say. And yet there are a few hiccups. Can someone help me solve this error?
cd /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/geometric_shapes && /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh cmake /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/src/geometric_shapes -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/geometric_shapes -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G 'Unix Makefiles' 

Gives this output and stops the build:
cd /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/geometric_shapes && /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh cmake /Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/src/geometric_shapes -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/geometric_shapes -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/pitosalas/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G 'Unix Makefiles'

A:

Have you tried to install qhull manually?
brew install qhull

For some reason I had tried it and it didn't work, but I must have mistyped, because now it did work.
