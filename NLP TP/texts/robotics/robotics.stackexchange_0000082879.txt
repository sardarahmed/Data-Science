I have RPLidar A1 device and I would like to know how I could limit the scan angle from 0 degrees to 180 degrees using Hector Mapping Slam.
Note: I am using ROS indigo on ubuntu 14.04.

I have tried that but did not work for me; it might be there is something that I am doing wrong. If you have any experience with this, please give the instruction how to run it.

Try following the example launch and use yaml file given in the tutorial, by replacing with your desired angles. If you need explanation of any part, feel free to ask.

the problem is when you run the ros indigo using the PRlidar view_slam I do not know how to run it with leaser filter in order to limit my angles if you know how to do this give me more explanation on it
