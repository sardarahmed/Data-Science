Q:

Navfn strange Behaviour

Hi,
I'm tunning the navigation stack for my robot, but nafvn is displaying a strange behaviour, sometimes it cannot plan when in narrow places.
Here are some screenshoots

In this case the navfn cannot plan

Anybody has an idea why this is happening
Thanks

I am seeing the same behavior, but I can't post a screenshot. In tight areas, the plan starts right after the tight area instead of  starting from the robot. Edit: Increasing cost_scaling_factor from 0.1 to 10 fixed this problem for me.

A:

I think navfn is quite simple in that it only plans for circular robots. Your's seems a bit lengthy and rectangular. This would lead to a circumference that just doesn't fit through the passage.

There have also been some observed bugs in navfn where it's sensitive to initial conditions.
