Q:

ROS publisher Errors?

Hi,
I work with ROS Jade in Eclipse and communicate withh V-REP.
And I have the following problem:
Most of the times my programmruns without problems,
but sometimes when I run it the following two different kind of hang ups appear.
Error Type 1:
[31m[FATAL] [1446845672.704039636]: ASSERTION FAILED
    file = /opt/ros/jade/include/ros/publisher.h
    line = 108
    cond = false
    message = [0m

The error happens, when I want to publish a twist  message.
Also extracting the topicname from this publisher leads to this error.
So I suspect, the publisher randomly has problems with the topic?!
Any ideas why?
Error Type 2:
The program crashes.
The debugger of eclipse shows corresponding call structure:
Thread #2 [fccf_node] 17359 [core: 3] (Suspended : Signal : SIGSEGV:Segmentation fault)

No ideda why it's hanging...
Maybe you have?
Both error appear everytime they appear at their same spot at the beginning of the program.
If the program runs smoothly it keeps running.
If it crashes, it crashes at the beginning.
Unfortunately I cannot provide a  minimal sample, as I cannot reproduce the error.
It appears randomly.
I use:
 * /rosdistro: jade
 * /rosversion: 1.11.13
GNU GCC : gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4
V-REP: V-REP_PRO_EDU_V3_2_1_64_Linux

I have no clue anymore.
Thanks in advance for your help!!!
You are the best!

Please add more details to your question including your platform, how you've installed and a minimal example of how to reproduce your issue.

I added the platform

A:

I solved the issue.
The error was some memory leakage, that produced the crashing of the publisher.
