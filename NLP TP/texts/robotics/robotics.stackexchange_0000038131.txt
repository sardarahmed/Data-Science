Q:

GSCAM over ubuntu server

Hi all..
i'm trying to add a web cam to my pionner at-e robot, i have ubuntu 10.4 server version (no x systems), i have already installed the required components of GSCAM and the compilation gives no errors or warnings
i export the environment variable
$ export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video1 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace"
then i run the node
$ rosrun gscam gscam
but i get the next error:
Gstreamer Version: GStreamer 0.10.28
no element "v4l2src"
any ideas? is it possible to run gscam on a server edition of ubuntu?
thanks a lot
Mario

A:

You need to have the gstreamer0.10-plugins-good package installed. The v4l2src element is located in the "good" plugins http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-good-plugins/html/gst-plugins-good-plugins-v4l2src.html
