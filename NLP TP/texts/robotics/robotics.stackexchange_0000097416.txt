A:

No, catkin_create_pkg is a standalone executable not related to catkin_make or catkin-tools (other than the catkin prefix and that it creates a metapacakge to be built with either of the two tools).
Use catkin_create_pkg to create the metapackage and you can compile with either of the two build tools above...
