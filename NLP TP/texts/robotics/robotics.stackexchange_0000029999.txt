Q:

How do I remove an unintended "flagged item"?

I (apparently) flagged an item as "offensive" by accident. I tried clicking on that link again, only to flag it twice, instead.
How do I remove the two flags from this item. It is a good post, and not offensive at all.

There looks to be no way to do that at the moment.  I found upstream documentation of this here http://askbot.org/en/question/195/how-do-i-display-all-flagged-questions

Seems to be fixed now with the current answers.ros.org software.
