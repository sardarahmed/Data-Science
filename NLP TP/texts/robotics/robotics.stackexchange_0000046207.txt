Q:

Drawing points/particles in stageros

I have this twist publisher working perfectly for the robot. I can see the range readings. I could use an independent cv.NamedWindow to visualize particles used in my custom particle filter. But I am wondering if it's possible to draw these particles as points directly stageros? (Say in the erratic-wander.world for example). I'm using rospy.
I would like to have something like these red dots:

A:

As far as I know, stageros node is limited in functionalities compared with stage. At this moment stageros is just suscribed to cmd_vel topic and have no services. Because of this I guess there is no way to draw on the initial world. If you find a way, please tell me ;)
