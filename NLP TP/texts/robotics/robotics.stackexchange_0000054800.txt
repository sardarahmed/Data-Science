Q:

Configuring ROS msg to transmit std::vector

Hello all,
I am using PCL (Point Cloud Library 1.7) with ROS and I have the following problem. I want to create a publisher and subscriber  node and publish three vectors : std::vectorpcl17::PointXYZRGB, with variable size each time (The vector may contain a different number of points each time).
Can anybody help me to configure the ROS msg in order to achieve transmission?
Best,
Akis

A:

Can you elaborate why you want to publish three vectors?
If you just want to publish a point cloud check the question and the answer here.
Here is a quite old discussion of  what you probably want to do.

There's a tutorial for creating messages here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv

Well, I am segmenting a point cloud (taken from a Kinect sensor) and I am trying to publish a vector with the centroid points of each extracted cluster and another two vectors that contain the minimum and maximum points of each cluster. In every iteration I might extract different number of clusters and therefore my published vectors will have a variable size.
What I could do is to try publishing the cluster clouds in a single vector, instead of publishing three vectors and then extract the centroid and max/min points on the receiving ROS node.
I am quite new with ROS and PCL and that's why I need your help an advise in this matter. I went through the suggested tutorials and I am trying to understand how ros message works but I still haven't fully got it.
Any help would be greatly appreciate it. :)
Best,
Akis
