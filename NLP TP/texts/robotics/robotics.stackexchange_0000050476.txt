Q:

Better map from Gmapping or Hector_Mapping?

Hello
Im trying to get a better pose estimation using a different methods like amcl or robot_pose_ekf and for that purpose I create a map from Gmapping and Hector_Mapping. So I like to try the both probabilistic approaches (amcl and robot_pose_eks )using the map from Gmapping and after that from Hector_Mapping. So my question is which map is better to be used??I have a bag file that have odometry , laser and imu.

A:

Both will produce similar maps; since you have odometry (& potentially a slow laser refresh rate?) it is probably better to use gmapping.
