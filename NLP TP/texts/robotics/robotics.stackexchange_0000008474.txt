Q:

Kinematic decoupling

Is kinematic decoupling of a 5DOF revolute serial manipulator also valid?
The three last joints is a spherical joint. Most literatures only talks about decoupling of 6DOF manipulators.
Thanks in advance,

A:

UPDATE Based on the comment below that the answer is not correct:
Kinematic decoupling divides the inverse kinematics problem into two parts. Coordinates of the wrist center point are calculated and based on those all the joint angles behing the wrist center point have to be determined. If this is possible, kinematic decoupling can be applied in you case. In other words if you can calculate a number of coordinates of the wrist center point that fully determines all joint angles behind your wrist center point than ... there you have it... kinematic decoupling works for you...
The original answer:
Yes, kinematic decoupling will work under 1 condition. You have to be able to determine the XYZ coordinates of your wrist center point (where the wrist axes intersect eachother) from the desired end effector coordinates. If the IK is solvable or not for the given input (i.e. the pose can be reached) is not a question of the kinematic decoupling but a question of the inverse kinematics
I may have been to fast in assuming XYZ, other coordiantes might be OK, depending on how many joints are there behind the wrist, XY could be enough. 
If you have 5 DOF and have the desired TCP coordinates (X, Y, A, B, C) you cannot calculate XYZ of the wrist center point, but not calcualting XYZ may be ok, if the coordinates you can calculate are enough to determine all joint angels before the wrist center point., So if you have X and Y of the wrist center point, and 2 joint before the wirst center point, if the X and Y coordaintes fully determine the q1 and q2 angles, kinematic decoupling can be used to write the IK equations.
