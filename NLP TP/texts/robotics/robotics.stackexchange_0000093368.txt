Hello!
I want to compile catkin_ws folder after I unziped a simulation package from "the construct" web site. When I run the comand catkin_make I receive this error:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):

A:

As with all ROS packages, you cannot just clone/unzip just that package and start building.
You need to make sure to have all dependencies installed, or compilation will fail.
Please refer to #q252478 for an example workflow.

Thanks! I did the steps from the winner answer of the link you pointed. Now i can compile the folder but the packages don't appear in ROS packages list. What can i do?

I'm not sure what "the ROS packages list" is.
Make sure to source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash after running catkin_make. Check whether packages can be found with rospack find $pkg_name. If that doesn't work, try running rospack profile and try rospack find again.

That was the problem... source /path/to/your/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash solved the problem
