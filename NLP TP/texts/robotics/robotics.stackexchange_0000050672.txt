Q:

viso2_ros demo.launch

Hi all,
I'm trying out viso2_ros (http://www.ros.org/wiki/viso2_ros?distro=fuerte) by running the demo.launch file that was included.  However, it requires a disparity_params.yaml for the stereo_image_proc node.  I don't see an example of what is inside the disparity_params.yaml.  I tried just putting in a camera calibration parameters.  But that does not seem right.
Output from the terminal:
aaron@AntaresL:~/Desktop/DRC/ROS_Examples/viso2-fuerte/viso2_ros/launch$ roslaunch viso2_ros demo.launch
... logging to /home/aaron/.ros/log/6948e56a-ae8e-11e2-b858-180373ea7946/roslaunch-AntaresL-6453.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: not well-formed (invalid token): line 12, column 57
What is needed in the disparity_params.yaml to make this program work?  Could someone show an example?

Hi astaranowicz,
our wrapper uses the same params than the libviso2 library, which you can find here. However, if you prefer to start with our default params, they were inside a comment in an issue, they are:
prefilter_size: 9
prefilter_cap: 31
correlation_window_size: 17
min_disparity: 20
disparity_range: 96
uniqueness_ratio: 10
texture_threshold: 10 
speckle_size: 200
speckle_range: 4

These parameter depend on the stereo camera and the environment (texture, light) you have there. Check the parameters in the ROS wiki for more information. If you have any other question, please feel free to ask, but with the parameters it's best to experiment.
Have fun!

Thank you for the help.  I also noticed that the wrapper doesn't pass any other parameters besides the camera parameters (such as focal length and principal point).  How do you pass the other parameters for the matcher and the bucketing?

All parameters listed on http://www.ros.org/wiki/viso2_ros can be normally set through rosparam, e.g. as  tag in launch files. This is the code fragment where the paramaters are read: http://ros.org/doc/groovy/api/viso2_ros/html/odometry__params_8h_source.html

Thanks for that.  I'll try it out.
