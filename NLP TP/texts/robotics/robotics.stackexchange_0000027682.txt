Q:

Use of GetLinkForce or GetLinkTorque

Hi,
In my gazebo plugin, I have to use the function
virtual math::Vector3 gazebo::physics::Joint::GetLinkForce ( unsigned int   _index) const pure virtual

or
virtual math::Vector3 gazebo::physics::Joint::GetLinkTorque ( unsigned int  _index) const pure virtual

These functions should return the force applied at the centre of mass of a link; the problem is that this functions are pure virtual, so I must define them.
I could use the ODEJoint class (that inherits from Joint class): this owns the above functions, but only virtual.
I don't understand how to use the ODEJoint class, nay how to include this class in my plugin.
Can I use this functions without having ODEJoint?
Thank you!

A:

Hi
I solved the proble adding
joint1->SetProvideFeedback(1);  

command. So I can use GetLinkForce without problem.
