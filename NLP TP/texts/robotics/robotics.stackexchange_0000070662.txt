Q:

Dynamically Changing Joint Velocities Moveit!

I am just wondering if the function 'scaleMaxVel' is functional in the current version of Moveit!
I have a robotic arm that I need to scale its velocity for various movements.
Any help would be much appreciated and if there is an alternative method for achieving this in C++ if this function is not functional.
