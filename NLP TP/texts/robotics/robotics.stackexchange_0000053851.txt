Q:

Turtlebot Simulator Package and Rviz Crashing

Currently Running Hydro and the newest version of the turtlebot_simulator Package. Previously teleop commands were not sending but that has been fixed in a newer version I think.
Currently having issues with RViz. It worked prior to the update, now it crashes when point cloud or any sensor is activated. Also, it has never worked with "image"
This was the crash in terminal:
Registered event listener change listener:  true 
[rviz-1] process has died [pid 3635, exit code -11, cmd /opt/ros/hydro/lib/rviz/rviz -d /opt/ros/hydro/share/turtlebot_rviz_launchers/rviz/robot.rviz __name:=rviz __log:=/home/thesis/.ros/log/c61c9da8-1447-11e3-90c8-0026b97f1590/rviz-1.log].
log file: /home/thesis/.ros/log/c61c9da8-1447-11e3-90c8-0026b97f1590/rviz-1*.log

Any ideas?

Hard to tell what's going wrong with that minimal error log. Does the mentioned log file contain any valuable information? Please also state, which launchers and RViz config files you are using.

Might be https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/676. What version of RViz are you using? Please post the contents of the log file.
Comment by Alkaros on 2013-09-04:
My Rviz Version is 1.10.3.
the print out in the logfile rviz-1-stdout.log was not so exciting:

Also I'm using the the turtlebot_rviz_launchers v2.1.1
Comment by jorge on 2013-09-04:
Version 2.2.0 is already there. Can you give a try? Also, do you use 32 or 64 bits OS?
Comment by Alkaros on 2013-09-04:
32 bit OS. Excuse my ignorance but how do I go about updating. My repositories were up to date before I downloaded it, I believe.
Comment by dgossow on 2013-09-04:
RViz 1.10.3 had this bug, it's fixed in the most recent release.
Comment by bit-pirate on 2013-09-09:
@Alkaros, if the new RViz version fixes this issue for you, please add a small answer saying so and accept it to close this question. Thx.
