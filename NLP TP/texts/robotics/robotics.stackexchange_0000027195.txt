Q:

Get real time factor from a headless gazebo

Hi,
I am now trying to tuning the gazebo simulation speed. Is there a way to get a feedback of the real time factor from the gazebo server if i run it headless ?

I'm trying to do the same thing but was looking for a way of doing it with a plugin. I found GetRealTime() in a modelplugin but can't find the realtime factor. How did you end up doing it exactly?
