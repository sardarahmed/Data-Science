Q:

Message for dual steering vehicle

I'm wondering if a common message type exists to control dual steering vehicles (both front and rear ackermann steering). I'm looking for something like Twist or Ackermann_msg.
If not, should we create a new package to hold it or is there an existing package we should add it to ?
