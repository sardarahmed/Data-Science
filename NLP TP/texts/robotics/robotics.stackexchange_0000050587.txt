Q:

trouble building ROS package lwr_robot

When building lwr_robot I get the following error:
[  0%] Built target rosbuild_precompile
make[3]: Entering directory /home/alexander/fuerte_workspace/lwr_robot/lwr_simulation/build' make[3]: Leaving directory /home/alexander/fuerte_workspace/lwr_robot/lwr_simulation/build'

make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/lwr_controller.dir/all] Error 2
There seems to be an issue with the gazebo package.
Do you have any experience with this?
Regards,
Alex

A:

You can take a look at this new (experimental!) package:
https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/kuka-lwr
it still requires some tuning of the PID gains, but the arm can already be moved a bit with MoveIt!
