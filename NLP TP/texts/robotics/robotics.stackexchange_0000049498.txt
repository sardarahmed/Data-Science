Q:

waiting for a service to be advertised?

hi,
I'm working with tabletop_object_detector and household_objects_database
I typed these commands in my terminal :
 roscore
 rosmake tabletop_object_detector
 rosmake household_objects_database
 rospack find tabletop_object_detector
 roscd tabletop_object_detector
 roslaunch tabletop_object_detector tabletop_object_recognition.launch

after the last command , the terminal tells me that :

INFO] [1363624742.520172331]: waitForService: Service [/objects_database_node/get_model_mesh] has not been advertised, waiting...

and when I tried to call these service , It told me that it's not found !

A:

You will also need to launch household_objects_database/launch/objects_database_local_server.launch with a properly populated .yaml file with the right connection parameters for your local PostgreSQL server.
