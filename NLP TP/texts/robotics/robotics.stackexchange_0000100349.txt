Can you check the contents of the following directory /opt/ros/melodic/lib/moveit_setup_assistant/  looks you are missing libmoveit_kinematics_base.so.1.0.8 file
Comment by vidu98 on 2021-10-19:
hi @osilva, im missing "libmoveit_kinematics_base.so.1.0.8" like you said,how to install that file.
Comment by osilva on 2021-10-19:
If you are missing this file, it means moveit is not properly installed. I suggest to check your moveit installation: https://moveit.ros.org/install/
Comment by osilva on 2021-10-19:
Also do a search of your full drive, it may be installed somewhere else, just to see what happened.

@osilva i am trying to reinstall moveit, im following "https://moveit.ros.org/install/source/",
when i try to run this command "rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}" i receive following error ;
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
ros-melodic-ros-controllers-cartesian : Depends: ros-melodic-twist-controller but it is not going to be installed
ros-melodic-twist-controller-dbgsym : Depends: ros-melodic-twist-controller (= 0.1.4-1bionic.20210921.212715) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

Hi I will respond to this question formally and let's start a new question as more people will get the chance to look at it. Thank you.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2021-10-20:
Don't build MoveIt from source, unless you did that initially to install it.
Just make sure you have no outstanding apt updates for any ROS packages.
I would recommend to undo whatever you did for your from-source install of MoveIt.

A:

I solved it by using  sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq ros-melodic-cob-cartesian-controller-dbgsymto force remove the broken package and then uninstall moveit using sudo apt purge ros-melodic-moveit* and then reinstalled it.
