Q:

Error when compiling PCL for ROS groovy install from source on Ubuntu 12.04.1

I'm trying to compile groovy from source on my Ubuntu 12.04.1 to help me understand catkin better and also so I can compile on my BeagleBone later. I followed the instructions on
http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Source
When I run:
$ ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install

I get:
==> make -j4 -l4 in '/home/sameer/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/pcl'

<== Failed to process package 'pcl': 
  Command '/home/sameer/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4' returned non-zero exit status 2

Reproduce this error by running:
==> /home/sameer/ros_catkin_ws/install_isolated/env.sh make -j4 -l4

Command failed, exiting.

Thanks. I had to apply the patches in this history as well:
