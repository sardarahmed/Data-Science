Q:

Linking with 32 bit libraries

I am trying to build a C++ ROS node that uses functionality from a proprietary library where I only have 32-bit binaries. I know from experience that ld will not link binaries of different architectures so is there any alternative for me to make it work?
If not, is it at all feasible to set up/build a 32-bit ros installation with a minimum of pain?

A:

Setting up a 32-bit ROS installation is easy if you start with a 32-bit Ubuntu installation. The 32-bit binaries will be installed automatically if you follow the ROS installation instructions.
