Q:

Convert .urdf to .sdf or load .urdf

Hi,
I am working on my bachelor-thesis and have a .urdf model I want to load.
First I tried gzsdf convert *.urdf an got the error [Converter.cc:50]   Unable to determine original SDF version.
I would also be happy if I can load the .urdf model.
There are different solutions to this problem, but I found no one without ROS. (I use Gazebo without ROS.)
Do you know, what I can do?
Thank you.

What version of Gazebo are you using?
Comment by Zwilling on 2013-04-30:
I use Gazebo 1.5.0
Comment by Ben B on 2013-05-06:
I would try upgrading to the latest Gazebo -- though back up anything important.  That way, the behaviour of our Gazebo installs will be more likely to coincide.

A:

In newer versions of gazebo, the correct syntax is
gz sdf -p /my_urdf.urdf > /my_sdf.sdf
