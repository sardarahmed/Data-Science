Q:

Creating a dynamixel action client controller

I am following this tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_controllers/Tutorials/Creatingdynamixelactionclient
When I run the command
python trajectory_client.py

Controller Manager shows following:
[ERROR] [1506614244.445647]: Incoming trajectory joints do not match the joints of the controller.
[ERROR] [1506614244.454837]: Excepcion in ypur execute callback: not all arguments converted during string formatting.

I have reviewed everything but did not find the error.
Thank you very much for your help.

A:

There seems to be a mismatch between joint names. In line 37 of the dynamixel tutorial : arm = Joint('f_arm') you need to set the same name as in your motor driver, i.e. arm = Joint('joint0_position_controller')
here I post a snippet of our arm driver based on dynamixel_motor.
  <node pkg="dynamixel_controllers" type="controller_spawner.py" name="joint_position_controller_spawner" output="screen"
        args="--manager=cyton_manager
              --port left_arm_port
              --type=simple
              joint0_position_controller" />
