Q:

Base for grippers?

Hi there,
i'm currently developing a driver for a gripper. Or let's say.. I'm starting to develop... ;)
Anyway i was looking for a existing driver and found the WubbleGripper and PR2_gripper_action.
I'll have a look at them, but i'm wondering why there isn't anything in the driver section mentioned about grippers.
In my opinion grippers are probably quite essential in robotics and would be good to have some existing messages/services/actions i could build my stuff on.
Are grippers just too different to have a common base? or what's the reason why there isn't anything?
cheers

A:

You might want to have a look at the GraspHandPostureExecutionAction. Of course whether that is the right choice for you depends on what you want; my reason for choosing this action format for our gripper is that the object_manipulator needs it.
