Q:

RoboEarth on Ubuntu oneiric: Compilation errors

Hi,
After following all steps to install roboearth (http://www.ros.org/wiki/roboearth) with ros-electric in Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric), I still have the following compilation errors when I do rosmake roboearth:

roboearth/object_scanning/re_kinect_object_detector/src/recognitionmodel.cpp:457:10: error: ‘class boost::filesystem3::path’ has no member called ‘native_file_string’, an similar ones
roboearth/object_scanning/ar_bounding_box/src/ar_kinect.cpp:479:63: error: taking address of temporary [-fpermissive], repeated several times

Note that I had to translate error messages into English, so probably they're not the same text you would have if you try to reproduce the error.
Thanks!
Regards,
Enrique

A:

This looks like the transition between boost filesystem version 2 and 3.  Roboearth probably needs a patch.  Another similar question http://answers.ros.org/question/1459/boostfilesystem-version-issues
