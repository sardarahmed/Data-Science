Q:

TF Tree Shared var

Hi all, does TF support such a structure
GLOBAL -> A  
GLOBAL -> B  
GLOBAL -> C 
M -> A  
M -> B

I don't want to setup my tree as M -> GLOBAL -> the rest because then I have to manually compute the transform between GLOBAL and M which is annoying

Well, no.
Check out the tf tutorials.

tf builds up a tree structure of frames; it does not allow a closed loop in the frame structure. This means that a frame only has one single parent, but it can have multiple children.

Does that mean if I want to seutp the above strucutre. I need to manually calculate my own transform and publish it that way?

I think if the transform between M and A, B and C is fixed, you have to setup your tf tree like this:
Global -> M -> A
I prefer the fixed global frame at the top.
But if you can't setup this configuration, manually compute and broadcast the transform.
