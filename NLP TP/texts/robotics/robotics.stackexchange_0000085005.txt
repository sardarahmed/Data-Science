Q:

Nodelet error while running turtlebot gazebo on kinetic

i am not able to figure out how install nodelet separately, i tried to look in cmake file as well but got confused. PS i am new to ros.
Is there any one who can help? with some defined steps?
error message "[ERROR] [1517220409.629230351]: Skipped loading plugin with error: XML Document '/opt/ros/kinetic/share/gmapping/nodelet_plugins.xml' has no Root Element. This likely means the XML is malformed or missing..
"
Please

What do you mean by

install nodelet separately

? Also, please update your question with a copy and paste of the error message and what you've attempted.

@jayess, i am not able to attach screen here. Anyways i installed full desktop version of kinetic. followed guidline carefully. but now when run gazebo_turtlebot while initializing an error comes up that gmapping/nodelet is missing. I have been searching around but couldn't find the solution.

The image posting issue is due to you not having enough karma. In this case it works out in everyone's favor because you should copy and paste the terminal output not post a screenshot.

Based on your last comment I believe you're running into #q274849.
