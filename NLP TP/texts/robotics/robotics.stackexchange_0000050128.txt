Q:

Enabling depth reigstration

After roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch, then rosrun dynamic_reconfigure reconfigure_gui, I select /camera/driver, but nothing shows up on the reconfigure window, and the following error is shown on the openni.launch terminal:

[ERROR] [1365395678.038589497]: Client
[/reconfigure_gui_13810_1365391644607]
wants topic
/camera/driver/parameter_descriptions
to have datatype/md5sum
[dynamic_reconfigure/ConfigDescription/757ce9d44ba8ddd801bb30bc456f946f],
but our version has
[dynamic_reconfigure/ConfigDescription/5f0f929417f58ac7f30dfdd9e4d40ef2].
Dropping connection.

What is wrong?
Thank you very much for your help.

Thank you very much, Philip. I discovered the reason. I am using Electric in Turtlebot laptop but Fuerte in workstation. Perhaps the datatype changes when the ROS version changes. I run dynamic_reconfigure from the turtlebot laptop, then it is okay. And in rviz (run from workstation) the registered point cloud looks very nice.
