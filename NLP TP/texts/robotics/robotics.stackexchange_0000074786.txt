Q:

How do you use the navsat_transform set_datum service?

I'm trying to use navsat_transform and I'm having difficulty with the global frame origin not matching the latitude and longitude I'm setting it to in the launch file. For more on that particular problem, see here.
So I want to use the navsat_transform set_datum service to manually set the origin, as described in the GPS Integration tutorial. However the link to the robot_localization/SetDatum service message is broken (try it here) and I can't find anything about it in the source API.
I've tried:
rosservice call /set_datum <tab>

Like a conventional set_pose service, but that doesn't work. Does anyone know how to use the set_datum service correctly? Or otherwise manually change it after launch?
