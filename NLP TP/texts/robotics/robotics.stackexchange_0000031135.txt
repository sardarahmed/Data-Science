Q:

roscpp message callback threading?

If a simple node with ros::spin() in the main loop subscribes to two messages, will the message callbacks be called sequentially or be potentially processed in parallel?
Is the GlobalCallbackQueue global to all nodes/ROS, or just the node making the call?
I reviewed roscpp/Overview/Callbacks, and it indicates that there is a callback queue(s), but it doesn't confirm that one callback completes before the next callback is initiated.

A:

All threading is local to processes.
All callbacks can be associated with a specific callback queue.   All callbacks go into the default queue if not specified.  A NodeHandle can have a custom callback queue associated with it, or specific callback registrations.
If you have a single thread servicing a callback queue.  All will be serial.
Any specific callback will only be called after the last instance has finished, regardless of how many threads there are in the queue.
