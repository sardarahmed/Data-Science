Q:

rospy subscriber queue

Hello,
I'm writing an ekf by myself as a project in a lecture and I thing I have a problem with the queue of the callback function to update the odometry. The thing is that I subscribe the topic odom as:

 rospy.Subscriber("odom", Odometry, odometryUpdate)

but it does not has queue. I've checked this tutorial to see if there is any option of adding a queue in rospy, but I can not find it.
Is it possible to add a queue? If so, how can it be done?
if it is not possible to add a queue I would like to give more than just one parameter to the function odometryUpadte (the call back function). How can I do this?
Thanks!

A:

You can check the API here:
http://ros.org/doc/electric/api/rospy/html/rospy.topics.Subscriber-class.html
There you can see that you can define a queue size for you subscriber.
Hope that helps
