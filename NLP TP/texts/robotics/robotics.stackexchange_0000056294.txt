Q:

no robot visible in rviz for urdf tutorial

I'm working my way through the urdf tutorials, specifically this one
On the first task it has me launch rviz to see the "r2d2" robot using the command:
roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=01-myfirst.urdf
I am in the proper directory, rviz launches just fine, but there is no robot visible. Just the grid map. This error appears under the Global Status in orange: No tf data. Actual error: Fixed Frame [map] does not exist
So I get that it's not getting transform data, but I'm not sure what to do about it. I have not modified any files, am running hydro on Precise.

A:

Ok, so the idea was that this was fixed in the most recent commits to urdf_tutorial (see urdf_tutorial/commit/8e0df6bc).
Apparently, the CMakeLists.txt install statement removes the directory prefix and installs the files into the package's share directory (ie: $ROSDISTRO/share/urdf_tutorial). The recent commits make RViz expect its config to be in urdf_tutorials/urdf_tutorials. The consequence of this is that RViz cannot find the configuration file and substitutes some defaults (which result in what you are seeing).
Short term work-around: remove the second urdf_tutorial from the last line in display.launch, so it reads:
<node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" args="-d $(find urdf_tutorial)/urdf.rviz" required="true" />

Depending on how you installed the urdf_tutorial package, you might need to use sudo for this.
Long term solution: I've submitted a ticket to rectify this (again .. mea culpa): see urdf_tutorial/issues/6.
PS: the TF errors are ok for the 01-myfirst.urdf file: it doesn't have any joints.
