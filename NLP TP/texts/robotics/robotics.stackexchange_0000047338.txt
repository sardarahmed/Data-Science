Q:

Simulating the URDF and sending commands

Hello all,
I have been working with the URDF tutorials on the ROS website and have created a simplified version of my humanoid robot in the .urdf format.
I have been able to visual the robot and add some physical and collision properties. Now I want to automatically simulate the robot moving its joints by sending it some commands over the messaging service. Where can I learn how to do this?
Kind Regards,
Martin

Thanks davinci, this tutorial will help a lot! I was wondering if you knew the significance of start_time: 10000000000? Why the huge number for start_time, couldn't I just set the start_time at 0?
