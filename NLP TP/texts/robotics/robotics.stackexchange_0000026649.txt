Q:

Hydro: Getting blank (black) screen in gazebo

I am getting a random blank (black) screen in Gazebo 1.9 under VMWare running ROS Hydro. I have run groovy and other releases and did not have this issue until hydro. Has anyone else running hydro with Gazebo 1.9 under VMWare experienced this problem. Or any insights as to how to investigate this other then going to a duel boot.

A:

This issue is related to VM I am using VMWare and when I turn off 3D acceleration in the VM the blank screen issue goes away.

This fixed my issue as well turn off 3d acceleration. Thanks.

Indeed, nice debugging on this! Encountered the same problem when running gazebo5. Seriously though, just a black screen without any debugging/warning messages is not  the best way to go
