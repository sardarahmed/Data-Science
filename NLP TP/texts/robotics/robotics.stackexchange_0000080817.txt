Q:

Is it possible to replace the local planner in the default ROS Navigation stack to one that uses reinforcement learning?

I'm building a driverless car and the current problem is the TEB Local Planner.
I was wondering if it is possible to replace with an RL agent, and whether this has been done before.

have you found a solution to this?

A:

Definitely possible. You will need to implement a "base local planner plugin" of nav_core::BaseLocalPlanner . You can follow this tutorial to create a plugin (http://wiki.ros.org/pluginlib/Tutorials/Writing%20and%20Using%20a%20Simple%20Plugin).
The nav_core::BaseLocalPlanner class has a few pure virtual function so you will have to re-implement them, but basically you just need to implement your planner in the function computeVelocityCommands.
You can also access the costmap_2d object (which is given by the initialize function) so you can perform any logic/algorithm  to detect/avoid obstacles.
