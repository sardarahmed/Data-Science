Q:

How to use perception_odu as a dependency?

Hi Guys, I have created a package for 3D registration using a Kinect, I would like to use the normal distribution transform that are available in the perception_odu package. I have downloaded and compiled this package successfully in my fuerte_workspace and added it to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. However, when I add this line to the manifest.xml: <depend package="perception_oru"/>  I get the following error:Error: package/stack firefly_mv depends on non-existent package perception_oru.
Any help of how to use this package in my registration package would be much appreciated.
thanks,
Khalid

A:

Ok I realized that perception_oru is a stack, therefor the solution was to add <depend package="ndt_registration"/> which is the package I require and is part of the perception_oru stack.
