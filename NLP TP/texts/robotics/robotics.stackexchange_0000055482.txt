Q:

ROSserial can't find clock_gettime

Hi All,
I have been trying to compile the rosserial example "HelloROS" for embedded linux, but to no avail.
There are undefined references to "clock_gettime" however i have found the prototypes in time.h - here they are defined as extern's.

extern int clock_gettime (clockid_t __clock_id, struct timespec *__tp) __THROW;

I believe the time library is linking, it has been included in EmbeddedLinuxHardware.h.
Do I have to write the clock_gettime function myself?
Thanks.

A:

Depending on your setup, clock_gettime may be in libc, or it may be in librt.
Try adding -lrt as a link flag and see if that clears things up.
