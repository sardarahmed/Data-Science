Q:

ros debug to runtime

Hello,
i am looking for a good way to debug my program. At the moment i only use screen output because eclipse debug mode is not working.
My problem is that i am using a ros node and this is calling my c++ library. Not i want to debug my library when ros is running.
How i can do this? When i am using eclipse he and i say debug my node he give me an error : No source available for "main() at 0x4277e8"
then i tested the gdb launch-prefix="gdb -ex --args"
but then i cant type anything inside the shell, because i have a few rosoutputs.
Can anyone please help me and explain me what is the best way for debuging this?
thank you for your help

A:

I am not sure I understand your question, if you want to debug it with gdb, open a new terminal, type cd ~//bin (or wherever the executable is) and then run the command: $ gdb node-name. gdb will launch and then you could type: run to run it or you could set breakpoints in your code by typing : break line-number , and whenever it stops at a break point you could type : continue to go to the next breakpoint. I am not sure if this answers your question but I hope it helps!
