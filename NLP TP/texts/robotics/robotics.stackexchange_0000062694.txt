Q:

Running rostests with bag data

I'm in the processing of standing up some regression tests, and my tests require that I can play back bag data against my node, and then monitor the output. rostest conveniently provides all the tools I need to complete this, but what's considered best practice for where the bag data should be stored? I can't have my tests failing on Jenkins because the bags are missing, but then I also don't want my repo to get unreasonably large, and I will have quite a few of these regression tests to run. Should I just run them offline?

A:

If the test data is small it is usually ok to put them into the repo beside the tests. In cases where the test data is bigger I would recommend to place them in a publically fetchable location.
E.g. the tests for rosbag itself are fetching several bag files for verifying that the behavior has no regressions. See https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/8ea90cb30bb29e073234fd8de8063c3e1adc94d9/test/test_rosbag/CMakeLists.txt#L18
