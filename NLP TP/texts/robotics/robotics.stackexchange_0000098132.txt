Q:

Is there a way to localise my robot using a combination of the navigation stack and robot localization package

I'm using ROS melodic on a Raspberry Pi 3.
Basically I need to keep track of the robot as it travels. Using the ROS navigation stack I can track where the robot is, but I have to manually give it the initial pose. I would like to do this with GPS and an IMU. I'll be using the robot in the presence of a magnetic field so I don't think the IMU will give correct data, so I imagine I would need to use this in combination with a lidar scanner. I'm quite new to ROS so any direction would be quite helpful.

A:

You can use robot_localization package, the link below is a similar topic fusing IMU and GPS.
