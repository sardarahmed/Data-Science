Q:

Invert rviz scan screen 180 degrees

Hi,
I reversed a 2d laser scanner that rotated 360 degrees through a servo motor. Because I turn it backwards, there is a reverse image on the Rviz platform. that is, the ceiling looks like a base, and the base looks like a ceiling.How to fix this problem on the RVİZ. Thanks in advance.

A:

Please make sure you rotated the coordinate frame about the correct axes. ( z-axes). Seems like you have rotated it about y-axes. Follow the right-hand rule to decide which axes you need to rotate.

Thank you Mr. @Brahmanage . but axis is true.I was spinning the lidar around the z axis. when I turn the lidar 180 degrees, that is, when I do -z I have encountered such a problem. I think I need to do something small in the URDF model, but I do not know.
