Q:

Fovis: fatal error: linux/compiler.h: No such file or directory

Hi guys,
I have downloaded the visual odometry package Fovis (which is not a ros package) and I am trying to compile it using rosbuild on Fuerte and ubuntu 12.04. When I $rosmake ros_fovis which is the ROS package I created, I get the following error:
In file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:34:0, from /home/samme/fuerte_workspace/ros_fovis/libfovis/frame.cpp:1: /usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-35-generic/include/linux/stddef.h:4:28: fatal error: linux/compiler.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated.
I tried adding this line to the CMakeList.txt : include_directories(/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-35-generic/include/linux) but I still get the same error.
Am I doing something wrong? Is there a specific library I need to add?
Thanks for your help,
Khalid

Hi Khalid,
I cannot answer your question but want to point you to our wrapper for fovis: fovis_ros.
Feel free to use it under GPL license and look around in the implementation.
Any feedback is appreciated!
Stephan
