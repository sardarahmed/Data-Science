Q:

ROS documentation link redirects to wrong URL

Hello,
since some days; I've noticed that the Documentation link from http://www.ros.org/news/ redirects me to a wrong URL.
Clicking the link Documentation redirects me to an empty page http://www.ros.org/wiki/ and not as expected to http://wiki.ros.org/
Is it a local german problem ?
Thanks for checking this
Cheers
Chrimo

Hi there, I don't see such link, would you mind adding a screenshot of which one are you referring to?

I'm seeing this in the US as well. It's in documentation link in the banner across the top: Documentation Browse Software News Download.

Note the Download link is broken as well, and the Browse Software link works, but only because of a redirection (the URL is old).

I think it's an issue with our redirects (www.ros.org/wiki/* should redirect to wiki.ros.org/*). I'm working on it with our hosting people.

A:

I've updated the links across the top of ros.org/news to use the new resource URLs and not rely on the redirects from the old locations.
As @William said, We're also working to restore the redirects for better backwards compatibility.

Has this been completely resolved? I come across quite some links to ros.org/docs/.. fi that 404 for me currently.
And www.ros.org/wiki leads to this page instead of redirecting. Not sure whether that was always the case, but it's confused students to no end here.

I don't know the whole picture of what's going on but for redirection issue I opened a ticket for better visibility of the status.
