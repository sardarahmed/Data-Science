Q:

How should I install ROS using CMake, as shown in the tutorials?

ImportError: "from catkin_pkg.package import parse_package" failed: No module named catkin_pkg.package
Make sure that you have installed "catkin_pkg", it is up to date and on the PYTHONPATH.

A:

I had the same problem after some deep learning package installation which messed up my pythonpath
catkin_pkg in my installation was in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages which was missing from pythonpath.
So, this fixed it "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"
