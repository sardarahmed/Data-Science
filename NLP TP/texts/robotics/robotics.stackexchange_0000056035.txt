Q:

Mirroring the ROS wiki

I am trying to mirror the ROS API and wiki docs for a project with no internet access, by following the instructions on the wiki at http://wiki.ros.org/Mirrors#Creating_a_mirror.
The API docs seem to download fine, but mirroring the wiki:
rsync -azv wiki.ros.org::wiki_mirror wiki.ros.org --bwlimit=200 --delete

fails with
@ERROR: Unknown module 'wiki_mirror'

Am I missing something here or do the instructions need to be modified?

I'm seeing the same problem. I suspect the rsync server isn't set up right, or the documentation is wrong.

Just tried it, and it works for me (i.e., it starts downloading without error; I cancelled after a few seconds). Maybe they fixed the server?

Yup, the wiki_mirror module is showing up now. Thanks to the team behind ROS once again!!
