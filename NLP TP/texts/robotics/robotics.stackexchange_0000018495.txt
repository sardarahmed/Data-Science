Q:

How are shells for robotic arms made?

I wonder how the shells of robotic arms are usually made. By the shell, I mean this:

This is taken from the project here, which is a University project. If the shells were injection moulded, how would a university project have sufficient funding for the moulds? Even if the work was contracted to prototyping companies, it'd cost a few thousand of dollars for just one part. If not injection moulding, how are the shells made?

A:

To complete the comment of @FooBar on the Jaco Arm (The one from the Video), it use  Carbon Fiber as links
The old ones also used Plastic links with carbon fiber paint effect 
You can copy the carbon fiber effect easily if you need it.
