Q:

Can't access turtlebot through ttyUSB0

Hi,
I think that ROS can't access my Create... Is not possible see informations about the robot in turtlebot_dashboard, like battery and sensors status, but is possible to see netbook battery status, then I can conclude that the connection Workstation-netbook is ok, the problem could be between the netbook and Create. The status of all sensors in turtlebot_dashboard is Stale, except the netbook battery.
I'm using a serial-usb converter, because my Create uses a serial-serial cable. Could it be the problem?
Using "dmesg" and "lsusb" commands, I can see that my converter is properly connected at ttyUSB0. And I've tried to change the default_port in turtlebot_node.py to another USB and serial ports, but the error continues.
Thanks in advance,
Lucas

A:

I think I had the same problem with the ATHEN USB serial cable.
Here is how I solved it:
Add the following line in the /etc/udev/rules.d/52-turtlebot.rules:
ATTRS{idProduct}=="2008",ATTRS{idVendor}=="0557",MODE="666",GROUP="turtlebot"
2008 and 0557 is either the vendor or product id. You can find that out from lsusb.
The problem is that the ttyUSB0 does not have the approprite permission.

Have you tried to edit the file as a superuser (root)?

I am having the same darn problem that I had on the other one.  I can pull up the file and make changes, but I cannot save the new file.

I had a similar problem. I followed the instructions here, and got my turtlebot working for a day. I shutdown everything at the weekend. On monday,  I was back to zero. I am getting "Failed to open port /dev/ttyUSB0" What can cause this?
