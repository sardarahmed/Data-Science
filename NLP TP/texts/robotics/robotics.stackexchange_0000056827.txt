Q:

compile errors after update (ros::console)

After last update i ran into a few compile errors. Before the weekend everything was working fine, but after the update i can't compile anymore.
What can i do?
This is the output:

A:

Try:
sudo apt-get install -f

sudo apt-get autoremove

together with erasing build dirs and rebuilding in your workspace by (in the catkin_ws folder:)
rm -r devel
rm -r build
catkin_make

(See http://answers.ros.org/question/121266/undefined-symbol/?answer=121291#post-id-121291)

Plz create a separate thread and past the the parts of your nodelets/driver.cpp which cause the error (around line 150...)
