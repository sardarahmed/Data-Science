Q:

iostream not found

Hi,
I am creating a catkin package that adds some .c and .cpp files to the library. The .c files come from some very old project and it can be built without ROS. When I try to catkinize the project, I dont want to modify these .c files but just add them to catkin library, together with other .cpp files.
However, some of the c files have #include, #include, and when I do catkin_make, it says iostream/iomanip no such file.
Is there a way of using catkin_make without changing any original c files.
Thanks,
Yiming

A:

Something was odd with those c files in the first place.
.c files are C files (i.e. not C++) and C does not have iostream, iomanip.
Therefore I assume that is actually C++ code. So renaming those files to .cpp should be safe and fix the problem.
