Q:

Make the robot stop if it finds an obstacle in front

I am using the navigation stack (nav2) without problems, but I would like to understand how I can make the robot stop from its path if it finds a dynamic obstacle in front of it (at a minimum distance of n metres)?
Is there a demo or tutorial to take inspiration from?
many thanks in advance

A:

You can use the CollisionMonitor package inside the Nav2 Stack.
Here is a tutorial: Using Collision Monitor and here are the sources Github
