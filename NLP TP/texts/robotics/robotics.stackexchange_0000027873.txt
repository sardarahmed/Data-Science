Q:

error during building velodyne plugin

I was following this tutorial, but as i try to build the plugin file velodyne_plugin.cc i get this error:
/home/rob/velodyne_plugin/velodyne_plugin.cc: In member function ‘virtual void gazebo::VelodynePlugin::Load(gazebo::physics::ModelPtr, sdf::ElementPtr)’:
/home/rob/velodyne_plugin/velodyne_plugin.cc:23:15: error: invalid use of incomplete type ‘class gazebo::physics::Model’
         _model->GetName() << "]\n";
               ^

/usr/include/gazebo-2.2/gazebo/physics/PhysicsTypes.hh:36:11: error: forward declaration of ‘class gazebo::physics::Model’
     class Model;

How can i remove this?

A:

See this question. The problem can be solved by adding the following include to your cc file:
#include <gazebo/physics/Model.hh>

No problem, I only knew about it because I see this coming up over and over again. I'll fix the tutorial today.
