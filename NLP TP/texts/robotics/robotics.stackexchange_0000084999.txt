Q:

Python tutorials for Actionlib?

Are there python versions of the instructions for the various tutorials for ActionLib? I think I found the .py source code (that looks like the counterpart to the C++ version) but no instructions. Is that true?
For example: http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/SimpleActionClient

A:

The listing on wiki/actionlib_tutorials (section Beginner Tutorials) links to 2 Python versions of the C++ tutorials for me:

"Writing a Simple Action Server using the Execute Callback (Python)"
"Writing a Simple Action Client (Python)"

The advanced tutorials do not seem to have Python variants available.
