Q:

How to send commands to 2 or more motors simultaneously using dynamixel_workbench?

I am using Dynamixel XM-430 motors to control my robotic arm. I am a beginner so I don't have much experience on how to use the dynamixel_workbench. I want to send a command to 3 motors at the same time. I hope you can help me with this.
Thank You
