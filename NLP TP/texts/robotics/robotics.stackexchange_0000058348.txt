This answer gives a good overview of what the requirements are for the turtlebot1 gyro: http://answers.ros.org/question/115741/parallax-gyro-work-on-turtlebot-1/#116621
Looking at your gyro ( http://support.robotis.com/en/product/auxdevice/sensor/dxl_gyro.htm ) and doing a little math, it looks like it reads 1V/300 degrees/sec ~= 3.3 mV/degree/sec. Not quite as sensitive as the original gyro; you may have to make some adjustments.
There are also a number of other questions the discuss alternate gyros for the turtlebot:

Hi ahendrix,
You told me that I may have to make some adjustments to work correctly with my this sensor.
I'm confused, what kind of adjustments I shoud do.
This gyro doesn't work for me. Using it, my maps was really a mess ! :(
I need your help.
Kind regard.
