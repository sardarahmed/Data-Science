Q:

why rospy time always prining zero?

I need a time while running the simulation, but in my code returns zero time.
print rospy.get_time();  #output 0
print rospy.Time.now();  #output 0.0
but i see the time in  terminal when i run   rostopic echo /clock
Am i doing anything wrong while reading time?

A:

Did you initialize the ros node?

rospy.init_node("mynodename")

The typical approach to get the current time is:

now = rospy.Time.now()

If you are using some kind of simulation you also have to take into account how the use_sim_time parameter influence to the behavior of the rospy.Time. Have a look to: http://wiki.ros.org/Clock

yes, node was already initialized. still same issue

May be the use_sim_time param set to true?
can you check what you get from the following command line:
rosparam get /use_sim_time
Comment by anilmullapudi on 2016-06-16:
Yes, the simulation is running.  And the command  rosparam get /use_sim_time  is giving output true.
Comment by anilmullapudi on 2016-06-16:
rospy.Time.now() is working now after setting the use_sim_true param to false in launch file.

Why setting that to false would help? And how do you set it to false?
