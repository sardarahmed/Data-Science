Q:

Build ros2 from source in Docker

I imagine folks do this all the time, but somehow I can't find a standard Dockerfile or osrf image like osrf/ros2:source.
I see the tag mentioned here, but it doesn't exist: https://hub.docker.com/r/osrf/ros2/
Obviously I can just build my own, but I just wanted to ask in case I'm missing something obvious.

A:

In the end it was pretty simple to grab a copy of the osrf/ros2:source Dockerfile from https://github.com/osrf/docker_images and build it. I replaced $ROS_DISTRO-release with master to get the latest source.
Detailed instructions:
git clone git@github.com:osrf/docker_images.git
cd docker_images
# edit ros2/source/source/Dockerfile if desired
docker build --pull --no-cache -t osrf/ros2:source ros2/source/source
