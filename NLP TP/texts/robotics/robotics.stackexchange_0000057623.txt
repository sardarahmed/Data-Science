Q:

AndroidSensorsDriver

Can anyone explain me step by step how to communicte an android device and computer over ros. I am new on ROS. I just try to send info from android device to computer. the tutorial says,
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://IP:11311/
roscore
After that, I type the http://IP:11311/ on android device
But it doesn't work.
I dont want to know detail of android_core etc. so I download the application on my phone.  After i start the application and type IP, phone is shut down.
Is there any other way to communicate android device and computer. Or how can I fix this application error?

Are you replacing IP in the directions with the IP address of your computer?

A:

Both IPs are same and which is computer's IP. I solved my problem. I use Samsung Galaxy s2 and the android version is 4.1.2
The last version of android sensors driver application is not working for me. So I download previous version.(0.3) Now its works :)
