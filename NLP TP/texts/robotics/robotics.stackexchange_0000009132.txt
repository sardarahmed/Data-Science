Q:

Find orientation through Transformation matrix

I have a robot with 3 rotational joints that I am trying to simulate in a program I am creating. So I have 4 frames, one base frame, and each joint has a frame. I have 3 transformation functions to go from frame 1 or 2 or 3 to frame 0.
By using the transformation matrix, I want to know how much each frame has been rotated (by the X,Y and Z axis) compared with the base frame. Any suggestions?
The reason I want this is because I have made some simple 3D shapes that represent each joint. By using the DH parameters I made my transformation matrices. When ever I change my θ (it does not mater how the θ changes, it just does), I want the whole structure to update. I take the translation from the last column. Now I want to get the rotations.

A:

Based on your question, i understood that you have transformation matrices and you need to find Euler angles.
$$
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        r11&r12&r13&X\\
        r21&r22&r23&Y\\
        r31&r32&r33&Z\\
        \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&1
        \end{array}
$$
the first three rows and columns will give us a Rotation matrix.
You will get X,Y,Z rotation angles by comparing the above mentioned rotation matrix with 
$$
        \begin{matrix}
        cos(\psi)cos(\theta)&-sin(\psi)cos(\phi) + cos(\psi)sin(\theta)sin(\phi)&sin(\psi)sin(\phi)+cos(\psi)sin(\theta)cos(\phi)\\
        sin(\psi)cos(\theta)&cos(\psi)cos(\phi)+sin(\psi)sin(\theta)sin(\phi)&-cos(\psi)sin(\phi)+sin(\psi)sin(\theta)cos(\phi)\\
        -sin(\theta)&cos(\theta)sin(\phi)&cos(\theta)cos(\phi)
        \end{matrix}
$$    
I suggest to use quaternions, they will be of form  e0 + e
Here  e0 is the cos(angle/2) and e is the unit vector of axis of rotation multiplied by sin(angle/2).
