Q:

no rviz on hydro medusa

Hi,
I'm using ubuntu 13.04 and ROS Hydro medusa. When i try this command
rosdep install rviz

I'm get an error
ERROR: Rosdep cannot find all required resources to answer your query
Missing resource rviz
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks

I already install all package for ros-hydro*.
So how could i install rviz?

A:

Rviz has not yet been released for Hydro, which is still in alpha testing.
You can try building the groovy-devel branch from source. There may be problems, but feel free to ask another (separate) question if it does not work.
I believe rviz is being replaced by rqt_rviz, which has been released to Hydro, but I don't see any Ubunutu binary packages for it, yet. There is a ros-hydro-rqt-rviz source package for Raring.
UPDATE: Several people pointed out that rqt_rviz does not replace rviz, it just provides an rqt wrapper. So, you either need to wait for ros-hydro-rviz or build it yourself.

I've started the release process for rviz in hydro, so it should be there soon. It's still going to be rviz. rqt_rviz wraps rviz as an rqt plugin.

Ok...thank you for the answer. I'll try it

@dgossow is right: rqt_rviz does NOT intend to replace rviz; it depends on rviz. That's why it's failing to build.
