Q:

git clone https://github.com/pribot/rbx1.git

I read about the book ros_by_example_indigo_volume_1 , first time i tap
git clone https://github.com/pribot/rbx1.git

it print
Username for 'https://github.com' 

im sure it not talking about 'my own' username.
second i tap
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/pirobot/rbx1.git

it worked , but when i tap
git checkout indigo-devel

it print:
error: pathspec 'indigo-devel' did not match any file(s) known to git.

I download the zip form web page and unzip it to my ~/catkin_ws/src and try to catkin_make, nothing happen.
how can i do next?

A:

git clone https://github.com/pribot/rbx1.git

It is indeed pirobot/rbx1.git, not pribot.

git checkout indigo-devel

This works for me, but only if I clone pirobot/rbx1.git. I don't know whether the pribot/rbx1.git repository contains such a branch.
