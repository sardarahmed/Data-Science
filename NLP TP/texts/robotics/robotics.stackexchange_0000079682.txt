Q:

using GPS error mtdef.MTException: fixed point precision not supported

Hi, I appreciate your fast response on this.
I am using the Xsense MTi-G710 with all outputs enabled.
Inside the building without a GPS fix everything is fine. Once I get outside to open sky and get a fix, the driver fails showing this message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/renawi/catkin_ws/src/ethzasl_xsens_driver/nodes/mtnode.py", line 717, in 
main()
File "/home/renawi/catkin_ws/src/ethzasl_xsens_driver/nodes/mtnode.py", line 713, in main
driver.spin()

data = self.mt.read_measurement()
File "/home/renawi/catkin_ws/src/ethzasl_xsens_driver/nodes/mtdevice.py", line 632, in read_measurement
return self.parse_MTData2(data)

raise MTException("fixed point precision not supported.")
mtdef.MTException: fixed point precision not supported.
Any help?

A:

Fixed!
I changed the settings of the GPS data to floating point.

Where and how did you change it?

I Installed the Xsense manager on a windows PC and connected the sensor to it. There you find an option to change thr GPS data type.
