Q:

Kinect sensor not working?

Hi,
I want to see the output of the 3DSensors of the turtlebot in simulation in gazebo.
I am launching turtlebot in gazebo using command:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch
then,
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
then.
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch
then, Its showing:
started roslaunch server http:// localhost:53453/

A:

Assumes that you are using hydro.
To simulate turtlebot, you don't have to launch minimal and 3d sensor. You can control both 3d sensor and robot with the command below.

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_empty_world.launch

or

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_playground.launch

/camera/depth/points will give you 3d data. check with this command

rostopic bw /camera/depth/points 

or bringup rviz and see.

roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch
