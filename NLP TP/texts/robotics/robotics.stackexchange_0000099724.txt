Q:

turtlebot3 navigation parameters

I want to change a turtlebot3 navigation parameter called "inflation radius", I don't know how to actually go into the required yaml file to do so. I'm just confused. A book on programming the Turtlebot3 doesn't explain how to do so.
The book just gives the following  instructions:
" ...The following is the parameter setting for the TurtleBot3 Burger........
..... turtlebot3_navigation/param/costmap_common_params_burger.yaml". As seen, the instructions give the path,but I dont know where in my computer I can find this path.
I have already looked at the ROS navigation stack wiki, it doesn't help at all. Please anyone with experience using Turtlebot3, please reply

A:

@Mike Scheutzow I figured out my problem and it works now! I had duplicate files of turtlebot3_navigation in different places
