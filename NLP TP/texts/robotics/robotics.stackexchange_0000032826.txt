Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: tfMessage ROS

Where is tfMessage defined? It is used in the transform_broadcaster.cpp file. I have found a file called tfMessage.h, but it defines tfMessage_, not tfMessage.

There is. See the tf tutorials (http://www.ros.org/wiki/tf/Tutorials) for how to best use tf.

I had been planning on writing a subscriber node that would interpret the tf messages. If it is not a good idea to directly interact with the messages, is there an existing subscriber node?

You probably already knew this, but for posterity's sake: you probably don't ever want to touch tf messages directly; instead, use TransformBroadcasters and TransformSubscribers to interact with tf at a transform level, not a message level.

A:

ROS messages are defined in files with the extension *.msg. So, tfMessage.msg is the file for which you're looking. For your convenience:
