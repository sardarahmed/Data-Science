Q:

RGBD-Slam crash using StereoSetup

Hi,
I have problems running RGBD-Slam with a stereo camera. I wrote my own Stereo Matching Node which publish without any problems the Image and PointCloud2 Topic.
I added the Topics to the launch file:

But when I start RGBD-Slam the process dies:
REQUIRED process [rgbdslam-1] has died!
process has died [pid 15872, exit code -11, cmd ../ROS_Workspace/rgbdslam_freiburg/rgbdslam/bin/rgbdslam __name:=rgbdslam __log:=/../.ros/log/bea44dbc-d335-11e2-9c6f-406186ad7db0/rgbdslam-1.log].
log file: /../.ros/log/bea44dbc-d335-11e2-9c6f-406186ad7db0/rgbdslam-1*.log
Initiating shutdown!
What am I doing wrong?

A:

My first guess would be that the point cloud needs to be structured, i.e. have width and height like the image.
