Q:

Can rosservice commands be used on topics

I saw the following line in this wiki tutorial on ROS services and parameters:

rosservice has many commands that can be used on topics, as shown below:

I think this is a typo as rosservice commands should work on services and not topics. But as a relatively new ROS user, I would like a confirmation from more experienced users.
Thanks.

yes, this is a mistake and should be corrected.
Could be copy-pasta from the rostopic page.

Wow! I learnt ROS from HRWROS on edx.
I have corrected the mistake though.

Seems that topics was there since at least 2009-09 (this rev).
Fix diff.
