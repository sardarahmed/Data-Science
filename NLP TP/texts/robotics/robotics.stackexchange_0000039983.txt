A:

The build farm is still being set up for releasing Ubuntu Precise binary packages. I expect it will be ready soon, but don't know when. Maybe one of the people working on it can provide an estimate.
You can try building Fuerte from source right now, I suppose. There may be problems with some dependencies missing from Precise.
UPDATE: you can view the progress of Debian packages for Precise on the Fuerte debbuild status page.
UPDATE (2012-05-03): most Fuerte Precise packages look to be available now, including ros-fuerte-perception-pcl.

I have tried but I am getting troubles from python 2.7. In the roscore I get auto-starting new master
Exception AttributeError: AttributeError("'_DummyThread' object has no attribute '_Thread__block'",) in <module 'threading' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.pyc'>. Anyone had this problem?

You will need to install the new catkin build tools and learn how to use them. The ROS core is no longer built with rosmake.

Thanks Jack.  I'll try this again.  I tried last Thursday, but the install failed and rather than delve deep into why, I simply reverted everything.  I'll post here if there are still issues.

Good idea, Patrick. I would not be very surprised if we find some holes in the documentation. If there are, let's fix them.

Not just documentation holes, rosdep install problems on Precise.  Just doesn't work properly (see answer below).

Jack O'Quin do you know if there is any beta document,  available, to build ros fuerte with catkin? this http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Debian works in section 1.3.1 (Install core libraries), with problems in roscore (like i told before). If i try 1.3.2 i lost roscore, roscd...

@Filipe Santos: I get that error too; just filed a ticket about it: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3950.
