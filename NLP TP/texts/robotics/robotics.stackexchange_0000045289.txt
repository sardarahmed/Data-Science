Q:

catkin_pkg is missing topological_order

Ubuntu 12.04
ROS Groovy

After installing python-catkin-pkg and ros-groovy-catkin from the ROS debian repositories, and manually creating a catkin workspace and then calling cmake ../src from the build directory, I saw the following error:
/opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/em/order_packages.cmake.em:6: error: <type 'exceptions.ImportError'>: No module named topological_order

A:

This was happening because python-catkin-pkg was out of sync in the debian repositories (version 0.1.0) and ros-groovy-catkin now requires at least version 0.1.3.
You can download the latest python-catkin-pkg from ros-shadow-fixed here.
