Q:

python errors on sourcing devel/setup.zsh

When I source devel/setup.zsh in a catkin_tools workspace while using zsh I get python errors on Bionic using Melodic:
% source devel/setup.zsh
  File "<string>", line 1
    from __future__ import print_function
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
  File "<string>", line 1
    from __future__ import print_function
^

Has anyone else seen this?  Do you have any idea how to troubleshoot this?

A:

This was cause by issues in my python enviroment.  Closing as this is not an issue with zsh.

What was the issue?

It had to do with some bug in colorized cat that uses some python package I installed with pip.  I debugged this by using set -x and found it complaining about that library.
