Q:

Can sw_urdf_exporter be intalled in ubuntu?

Hello, I want to use sw_urdf_exporter  but I see that the installation guide concerns Windows users only. The problem is, I don't have Windows on my computer. Should I compile the source code with a C# compiler other than Visual Studios? Should I run the .exe in VirtualBox?

A:

It's a plugin to SolidWorks, which currently only runs on Windows, so there are no plans to get it to run on any other system.
