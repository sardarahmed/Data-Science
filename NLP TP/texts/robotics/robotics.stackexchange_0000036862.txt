Q:

how to create a custom message in ROSJava

I would like to create my own messages using rosjava but I don't know how to create it.
Example:
JointCommand.msg
string name
float64 effort

Later, how to set and get data from that message?
Currently, I know how to create simple messages and get data:
org.ros.message.std_msgs.String str = new org.ros.message.std_msgs.String();
str.data = "" + seq;

How to create a future complex message: JointCommand
Many thanks in advance.

A:

Currently rosjava requires all .msg/.srv files to be defined externally and included as dependencies in the manifest file.  I believe this was done to promote separation of msg packages and the packages that use them.  Any packages included in the manifest will prompt java JAR generation for those foreign message types.
