Q:

A suitable tool to simulate vision based robotic grasping?

I am doing some work concerning recognition of grasping points using 2-D image information and camera calibration information.I just want to verify my recognition method. Is there any simulation tool to help me focus on the verification of my recognition work? I hope to get different objects' image information easily and if I give a grasping hypotheses the motion planning work could be finished by the simulator.

A:

The best one I've seen is GraspIt, developed by Columbia:  https://graspit-simulator.github.io/
You can test multiple objects with different grasping points. Like in the picture here:

It has ROS integration so that's a plus :)
