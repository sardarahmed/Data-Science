Q:

How to store data receieved from UM7

dear,
i run a UM7 drivers but i'm not able to see inertial data (i'm able to see only messages like received packet XY without data or sending command zero gyroscopes).
Do you have some solution how to show inertial data (from accelerometers and gyroscopes?)
Thank you for your responce

Edit: thank you for your response. There is a manual how to show data for other users. I hope it should be useful.

install ROS + other features

sudo su

roscore

second terminal

sudo su

cd /root/catkin_ws   (or place where you have a catkin workspace)

source devel/setup.bash

rosrun um7 um7_driver _port:=/dev/ttyAMA0

A) show data in RVIZ

Third console
rosrun rviz rviz (you need rviz_imu_plugin)
add module IMU
fixed frame : imu_link
13 in module IMU fill topic /imu/data
rviz should show data from IMU

B) show RAW data in console

third console
sudo su
rostopic echo /imu/data (or show another type using rostopic list)

Why are you running things in a sudo su session? That should not be necessary (and is often very much undesirable).

Yeah sure, it is not necessary for all users. In my case i installed ros under root and without sudo session i am not able to run ros.

A:

Visualising and storing it are two different things, but both should be possible.
For a live 3D visualisation of the data, you can use the rviz_imu_plugin in RViz.
For plotting the data, you could look at rqt_plot or one of the alternatives that exist, like rqt_multiplot or PlotJuggler.
For recording the data, take a look at rosbag. That will also allow you to play it back later.
