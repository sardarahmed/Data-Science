Q:

Sound_play action library

Is there a reason the sound_play library is not implemented as actions? It seems odd to have a system with no feedback as to whether the sound actually played/was found, and the API seems very un-ROS-y.

A:

I think the main problem is with festival, as AFAIK it does not provide any feedback once you issue a command. Therefore you will never know if the text to speech has finished saying what it has to say.

I suggest that you file an enhancement ticket, and a patch will make it happen much sooner.

A valid point, but if you issue a say command without sound_play running, then the current library will print out an error, but give no actual feedback to the program that called the command.
