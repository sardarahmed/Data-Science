Q:

Balancing a plate with an IMU offset from the center

I recently bought a IMU . I am new at this. 
My question: Does the positioning of the IMU matter? Are there any differences between placing it at the center of the plate or if it is offset from the center?
I am still learning about this topic. So any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

A:

Basically it does not matter. 
But you have to be carefull if the plate is rotating fast, because the rotation of the plate around its center point, with the IMU placed out of center, will cause the accelerometer to measure centrifugal forces.
If your task is to stabalize the platform, this won't be an issue for you.
