Q:

Openni log file location and how to enable it

Hi all,

Could anyone tell me where is the Log folder when running Niviewer or Niviewer2? I install openni 1.5.4 and openni2 through ros package through apt-get as a dependence of ros-hydro-openni-camera and ros-hydro-openni2-camera. I installed Niviewer and Niviewer2 through openni-utils in apt-get. I assume I will get the same Log folder location when I run through ros-hydro-openni-launch and please correct me if I'm wrong.

I also want to make sure the right way to enable the log file is to modify the line in /etc/openni/GlobalDefaults.ini (Openni) or in /etc/openni2/OpenNi.ini
from
;LogWriteToFile=1
to
LogWriteToFile=1

Do I have to restart the computer for the modification to take effect or is there anyway for it to take effect without restarting the computer?

Thanks.

Did you look in ~/.ros?

I looked at ~/.ros, didn't find any clue. ~/.ros contains only ros related log.

A:

I've found that the openni driver doesn't seem to honor the openni log settings, but the openni samples do, and they're sufficient for debugging device and driver issues.
Try making those changes and then running one of the samples:
