A:

Use sensor_msgs::image_encodings::TYPE_64FC3. In the OpenCV naming scheme, this is 64-bit floating point (64F, aka double) with 3 channels (C3).
The full list of encodings is defined in sensor_msgs/image_encodings.h and viewable here. We define some named encodings (like RGB8) that specify the color semantics as well as data type and number of channels. The TYPE_* encodings support arbitrary data.

No matter what enconding type I use, I always get the same message: [ERROR] [1363015855.837613897]: cv_bridge exception: Unrecognized image encoding []. Can you please help me?
