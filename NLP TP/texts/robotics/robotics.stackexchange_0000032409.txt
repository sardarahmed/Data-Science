Q:

rbrief complilation problems

I can't get the rbrief package to compile. It seems that the stuff for the orb descriptor is not compiling or it has been disabled in the source code
Essentially the error that I get
scale_study.cpp:(.text+0x30d): undefined reference to cv::ORB::ORB(unsigned long, cv::ORB::CommonParams const&)' scale_study.cpp:(.text+0x324): undefined reference to cv::ORB::operator()(cv::Mat const&, cv::Mat const&, std::vector<cv::KeyPoint, std::allocator<cv::KeyPoint> >&, cv::Mat&, bool)'
scale_study.cpp:(.text+0x32c): undefined reference to cv::ORB::~ORB()' scale_study.cpp:(.text+0x741): undefined reference to cv::ORB::~ORB()'
I'm compiling it against the trunk version of cv

A:

You should not use the rBRIEF package anymore. rBRIEF was an attempt at making BRIEF rotation invariant and that resulted in the ORB descriptor that you can now find in OpenCV 2.3.
