Q:

How to reload visualisation_canvas without exit prolog shell?

I followed KnowRob_basics.
I found when I run
  visualisation_canvas(C).

I only can run it once.
if I run again, it just shows:
  ?- visualisation_canvas(C).
  C = @'J#00000140499119889776'.
  
  ?-

How to call visualisation_canvas again without restart prolog?
Thank you~

A:

Actually, there is a way to kill the old canvas and start a new one, but it's a bit hacky (which does not have to be bad, though...)
visualisation_canvas().

retractall(mod_vis:v_canvas()), assert(mod_vis:v_canvas(fail)).
visualisation_canvas(_).
cheers

Thank you~~ In my case I should run: retractall(mod_vis:v_canvas(C)), assert(mod_vis:v_canvas(fail)).
visualisation_canvas(C). It works!!
