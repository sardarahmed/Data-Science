Q:

colcon build exception

I am getting this error when using the colcon build command. I don't know how this occurred and everything was working really fine.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 2866, in get_entry_map
    ep_map = self._ep_map
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 2828, in __getattr__
    raise AttributeError(attr)
AttributeError: _ep_map. Did you mean: '_dep_map'?

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Things I have tried!
I haven't found any solution online, and also the auto completion for colcon is also not working

I have tried re-installing python3-colcon-common-extensions package using

sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

also I have these sources in my .bashrc file
# ros-humble-source
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# colcon_cd command setup
source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh
export _colcon_cd_root=/opt/ros/humble/

# colcon tab completion
source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash

A:

The error that you're getting is ValueError: ("EntryPoint must be in 'name=module:attrs [extras]' format", '<<<<<<< HEAD')
This suggests that you have a setup.py file in your Python search path which has invalid syntax. Most likely this is somewhere in your workspace and not an installed package or in the build tool like colcon.

I don't know how this occurred and everything was working really fine.

I would try to think back carefully about what changed in this period between when things were working and weren't working as that's likely the best way to find out what was wrong on your system.
