Q:

Install errors on OSX

I am trying to install ROS Groovy using the instructions on http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source.
I am installing on a fresh installation of Mountain Lion. I have installed XCode + command line tools and followed the instructions on the page.
I have chosen the recommended desktop installation.
I get to the point where I run ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install-space /opt/ros/groovy --install
Compiling the first package, bfl, I get the following error:
[ 40%] Built target orocos-bfl
[ 41%] Building CXX object tests/CMakeFiles/test_complete_filter.dir/complete_filter_test.o

Since the OSX installation is brand new, I suppose that I haven't got any other software or libraries installed that interferes with the ROS compilation. Is there any step I have missed in the instructions?
Kind regards,
Jesper

A:

bfl is a Filtering library which is used in some things like the navigation stack.  You probably don't need it, you can just remove it from your workspace and move on:
$ rm -rf /path/to/workspace/src/bfl

Additionally, pcl* is known not to compile currently, so remove it too for now:
$ rm -rf /path/to/workspace/src/pcl*

If you really need bfl to work, I suggest emailing the maintainer since an issue tracker is not listed for it.

Thanks. I am just learning ROS, so I don't know if I will have any use for bfl or not. If I do, I will debug the compilation.
