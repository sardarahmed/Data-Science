Q:

How to use Twist messages in robo-arm?

Hello.
We have arm with servo joints,we are  writing controller for it, and i don't know how correctly apply Twist messages,to control it.
Some questions:
1)If task is only to rotate angles of  servos , i need only "angular" field of Twist?

If arm has 4 servos, i have to send 4 Twist for  each of them? How should i do this? Arrays, separated topics or otherwise?

Twist not used for this tasks and this questions don't make sense.

I will  be appreciate any advice. Thank you very much.

A:

I'm not sure, but I don't think its usually the case that manipulators expose a geometry_msgs/Twist interface. So i'd go for your option 3.
Most of the planners ROS uses out-of-the-box generate plans in joint space, so a trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory interface would seem like a logical thing to have. You can probably look at some other implementations for inspiration.

Edit: if you're starting from scratch: be sure to take a look at ros_control, and for arms/manipulators, the joint_trajectory_controller. Could save you a lot of work.
