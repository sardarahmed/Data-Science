Q:

How to modify the slam_gmapping node on a turtlebot?

I want to modify the slam_gmapping node on my Turtlebot (Kobuki) (Ubuntu 12.04).
I have a working catkin workspace and have built my own nodes that work with slam_gmapping, but now I want to modify it.
I downloaded the slam_gmapping source to my workspace and tried to build it, but get this error...

-- ==> add_subdirectory(slam_gmapping/gmapping)
CMake Error at
/opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:72
(find_package):   Could not find a
configuration file for package
openslam_gmapping.
Set openslam_gmapping_DIR to the
directory containing a CMake
configuration   file for
openslam_gmapping.  The file will have
one of the following names:
openslam_gmappingConfig.cmake
openslam_gmapping-config.cmake

How does one "set openslam_gmapping_DIR"?  is that a line in some file?  But even if it were, neither of those suggested files exist on this system.
this is the failing line:

find_package(catkin REQUIRED nav_msgs
openslam_gmapping roscpp rostest tf)

It seems openslam_gmapping package does not exist on this machine (at least not with that name) in any workspace.  Maybe it was built special for the Turtlebot under a different name?
I don't have any need to build the openslam_gmapping package, just to reference the built one.  I know it exists somewhere because I can successfully build maps and "rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping".
Any suggestions?

I thought this might be an issue of needing a proper "overlay".  I followed the instructions on http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying (substituting slam_gmapping for the tutorials) but got the same error.

@gershon hi, gmapping pacakge uses libraries built from openslam_gmapping. clone openslam_gmapping and overlay if you want to edit files of openslam_gmapping.

Hi bvb.  I'm quite new at this.  By "clone openslam_gmappnig" I think I need to use subversion (svn) to get it on my machine, right?  Or is there another location?
Also I thought "overlay" was a ROS/Catkin concept...  how does it work with other projects?

i mean "git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/openslam_gmapping.git" or if you are not using git, just download source as zip , extract and use.

A:

I finally figured this out.  The problem was that if you follow the links to the openslam_gmapping dependency from the slam_gmapping page it takes to a site that provides a svn (subversion) repository that has nothing to do with ROS or Catkin.  I had no idea how to integrate that and get it building with Catkin.
Good news is, that there is a ROS/GIT repository for openslam_gmapping and it is Catkin, so when I finally got that everything builds fine and the instructions for Overlaying make it so I can build and run my versions.  Yay.
