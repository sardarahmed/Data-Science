Q:

[SKIP] No rule to make target None

I have a problem that appeared overnight. All of my code is on an SVN and used to compile fine. This morning, I started getting this problem when compiling some packages:
[SKIP] No rule to make target None

I did not use the computer for about ten days because I was at a conference, but it was off so no updates were applied since the last time that I used it.
So here is what I tried.
roscreate-pkg foo
rosmake foo

And I got the same problem:
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...                                                                                                          
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['foo']

[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['foo'] to:
['foo']

[ rosmake ] Built 1 packages with 0 failures.                                                                                            
[ rosmake ] Summary output to directory                                                                                                  
[ rosmake ] /home/robot/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120918-154406 

I then applied all Ubuntu updates for 12.04, including all updates for ROS Fuerte. I created package foo2 and I still have the same problem. In my own packages, it seems like the build starts, but does not finish, because the ROS messages are not generated.

Are the packages in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?
Comment by Benoit Larochelle on 2012-09-18:
Yes, everything is in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. roscd and rospack find work perfectly. By creating a new package foo, I wanted to ensure that it was not a dependency problem.

A:

In the end, I uninstalled ROS with
sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-*
sudo apt-get autoremove ros-fuerte-*

Then, I rebooted, re-installed ROS, and everything is fine again.

Same thing happened to me with a fresh install of groovy. It turned out some nasty stuff actually happened to my environment variables ( file ".bashrc" being damaged). You can check the variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is correctly set by running "export" in a terminal. It displays all variables defined.
