A:

It looks like the Wrench type was added very recently ( https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/commit/e04d803f50fb33cb0bde6590a770fedbe0fb9940 ), and was released for deb build about a day ago.
You have a few options:

Build the latest rviz from source
Switch to using the unstable deb repository, which has the latest debs but tends to be incomplete
Wait a week or two for the latest version to make it into the stable repository
