Q:

fovis on depth-only sensors?

Hey,
I wanted to implement SLAM on Occipital's Structure Sensor which happens to be a depth only camera and provides no RGB images.
I was wondering if there is anyway to use the Fovis package to obtain odometry from Structure despite the fact that it subscribes to /rgb/image_rect
Is there any remapping etc that can be utilized for this or is that RGB frame crucial for odom calculation?
this is the error I get
Images received:            0 (topic '/camera/rgb/image_color')
Depth images received:      33082 (topic '/camera/depth/image')
Image camera info received: 0 (topic '/camera/rgb/camera_info')
Depth camera info received: 33082 (topic '/camera/depth/camera_info')
Synchronized tuples: 0
Or if there is any other option to perform 2D slam on structure sensor?

Hey,
Any input will be very much appreciated. Thanks

A:

libfovis uses FAST features to track images. A color image is required to use it. Read the article.
