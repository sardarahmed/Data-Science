Q:

DRCSIM head floating?

In the out-of-the-box DRCSIM 1.3.1 the head is floating disconnected from the robot. Is there an error in some offset, or will there be more hardware to fill in the gap?
Thanks,
Chris

A:

The offset is correct, there will be more hardware (mesh) in the gap early-February.
