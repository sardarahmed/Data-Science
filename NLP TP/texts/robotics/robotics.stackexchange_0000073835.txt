A:

From the 'Code API' link on the sound_play wiki page you can get to the documentation and example for the C++ SoundPlay client.
The function you probably want to use is playWaveFromPkg; it should look something like this:
int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    ros::init(argc, argv, "example");

    ros::NodeHandle nh;
    sound_play::SoundClient sc;

    sc.playWaveFromPkg("sound_play", "sounds/BACKINGUP.ogg");

    ros::spin();
}

Thank you very much . I can play the sound file successfully!!
However, I can't control its volume, it's always too low.

The documentation and example links are broken

The links are now found under the docs directory for each distribution
