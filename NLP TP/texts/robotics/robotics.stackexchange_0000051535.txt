Q:

pcl_visualization-eigen-package

I have found pcl_visualization in the following:

svn:
uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/stacks/perception_pcl_addons/tags/unstable

When I am trying to run rosmake perception_pcl_addons i get the follwoing error:
'pcl_visualization' depends on non-existent package 'eigen'
I have eigen-config.cmake  eigen-config-version.cmake in:
/opt/ros/groovy/share/eigen/cmake$
Can I generate the eigen package from this eigen-config.cmake?
Or where can I find that package?
I am have groovy installed in my system
Cheers

A:

That looks like pretty old code. Anything actively developed is probably somewhere on github now.
