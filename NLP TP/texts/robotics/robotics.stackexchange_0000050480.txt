Q:

rgbdslam and octomap

Hi everyone I'm new to ROS and I have the following questions:
how do I get rgbdslam to work with octomap?
I have successfully installed the package and its dependencies to the point that I can launch
roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch
but I don't know how to capture a 3D representation of room.
if I press "space" or "enter" I only get one image of the kinect, but what should I do to get the full representation of the room?
also what should I do to get this map saved on octomap?
Also this is the error that I'm receiving:
[FATAL] [1366306714.012014901]: Can't run SiftGPU
[FATAL] [1366306717.289295636]: SiftGPU cannot be used. Detection of keypoints failed

Thanks

A:

Seems you lack GPU support on your system (small laptop? virtual machine?).
Maybe you just need to install proprietary drivers?
Otherwise, in the launchfile, try changing both occurrences of "SIFTGPU" to "SIFT" (painfully slow), "ORB" (fast but high errors) or "SURF" (medium speed/quality).
P.S: After recording the map, just use "OctoMap->Save Octomap" to create the octomap.
