Q:

Can one node be a client for several action/service servers?

I have one client which runs a state machine that coordinates between planner node, perception node, localization node and motion control node. I am using ROS action to communicate between state machine and planner node. I want to trigger motion control node when planner node sends a goal status as SUCCEED. Is it possible to use same client state machine node as client for other servers?
If possible is it the same also with ROS2 (crystal)?

A:

The Q&A @curi_ROS links should already give you an idea, but to make it explicit:

Is it possible to use same client state machine node as client for other servers?

yes.

If possible is it the same also with ROS2 (crystal)?

yes.
In both cases: action/service clients are "just variables" in your program. You can create a virtually unlimited (within reason) number of clients that way.

Multiple servers in a single node is also supported btw.
