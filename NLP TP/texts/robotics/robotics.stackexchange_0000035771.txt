Q:

Data logging with rosbag in rosjava

Hi,
I am currrently using rosjava to create an control interface on my tablet to control a robot. Everything works fine except that rosbag does not record information from the nodes created by rosjava.
May I know if this logging feature has been supported for rosjava? If yes then how to enable it? Thank you very much.

Are you setting the host correctly in the NodeConfiguration? Can you provide some sample code?

I am sending command velocity to drive the robot from a Motorola Xoom tablet. The command velocity sent from the tablet was not recorded properly while that sent from the robot machine itself could be seen in the bag file. I am using the rosjava version from source as of July 2011.

What information isn't being recorded exactly? Are you using the latest rosjava from source or the released binary version?

A:

It's possible that this is due to the way that rosbag subscribes (i.e. using wildcards). Support for that was added more recently. You may need to update to the latest rosjava.

Oops, just noticed that it looks like rosjava isn't providing the right connection information.  The provided message definition seems to be always empty "".  This results in an md5 of d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.

I can confirm that prior to the latest update (Rosjava Android from late October), rosbag record was broken.  I updated to the latest version (~Nov 17), and this is now fixed.  If you have this problem, be sure you're running the latest rosjava from source.
