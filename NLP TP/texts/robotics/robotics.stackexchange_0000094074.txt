Q:

Resource not found

Hi,
I am working within a simple ROS workspace where I have two packages.
I have included in my workspace (as a new package, "robotic_moveit_config") a configuration generated by MoveIt setup assistant. My question is about this particular package.  The configuration generated by MoveIt setup assistant already creates different launch files.
I can build the workspace correctly, and then using roslaunch  I can successfully run, for example.
roslaunch  robotic_moveit_config demo.launch
and so I can test simple planning scenarios in rviz.
At the same time, I am trying to write some simple motion planning programs.
zahid_test_workspace
src  
--  my_test_pkg
--   ur5_moveit_config 
      
      -- include
      -- src
      -- launch    
         -- smp.launch

Here, when I try to issue
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config smp.launch 

I receive the following error.
Resource not found: ur_description
Although before running roslaunch, I do the following
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
source devel/setup.bash

The strange thing is that, other day, I was able to launch my program.
Here is the launch file that I am using.
<launch>
<include file="$(find ur5_moveit_config)/launch/demo.launch"/>
<node name="ur5" pkg="ur5_moveit_config" type="ur5" respawn="false" output="screen"/>
</launch>

thanks,
Zahid

Did you build your workspace before calling source devel/setup.bash? Can you please add the output of echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH?

I build the package using,
catkin clean
followed by
catkin build
then I issued
 source devel/setup.bash
The complete error is follows
Resource not found: ur_description
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/zahid/Desktop/IMPLEMENTATIONS/zahid_test_ws/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/melodic/share
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

and the output from echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/zahid/ws_moveit/src/ros-moveit-arm/moveit_plugin:/home/zahid/ws_moveit/src/moveit_tutorials:/home/zahid/ws_moveit/src/ros-moveit-arm/my_arm_xacro:/home/zahid/ws_moveit/src/panda_moveit_config:/opt/ros/melodic/share

I explicitly added the following path
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/zahid/catkin_ws/src/universal_robot:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH 

to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. Then, to confirm I issue echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and I receive the following output
/home/zahid/catkin_ws/src/universal_robot:/home/zahid/Desktop/IMPLEMENTATIONS/zahid_test_ws/src/my_test_pkg:/home/zahid/Desktop/IMPLEMENTATIONS/zahid_test_ws/src/ur5_moveit_config:/opt/ros/melodic/share

The directory ur_description is found under /home/zahid/catkin_ws/src/universal_robot, and therefore I added this path. Following this, I issue source devel/setup.bash  and roslaunch robotic_moveit_config smp.launch  and still see the following
Resource not found: ur_description
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/zahid/Desktop/IMPLEMENTATIONS/zahid_test_ws/src/my_test_pkg
ROS path [2]=/home/zahid/Desktop/IMPLEMENTATIONS/zahid_test_ws/src/ur5_moveit_config
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/melodic/

i tried the following

adding the following line to the ~/.bashrc file.

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/universal_robot:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}

copying the directory ur_description under /home/zahid/Desktop/IMPLEMENTATIONS/zahid_test_ws/src/ur5_moveit_config/

But, still the same problem persists.
thanks for your time.

It would be wonderful if anyone could answer this question, as I am receiving the same results regardless of the ROS paths I indicated.

A:

The package ur_description is not released for meldoic, yet.

You can get the source code from https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/melodic-devel .
Clone it from github into a folder in your workspaces src folder

Please never manually edit the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
Try to work with ONE workspace only. In it:

you have one src folder with multiple subfolders, e.g.:

universal_robot (from the repo above) and also
my_test_pkg (from the MoveIt setup assistant)
There should also be a file  CMakeLists.txt, that was generated by catkin_init_workspace

Remove devel and build folder,
in a clean terminal source only source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
build the workspace

after this, source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash is sufficient.
