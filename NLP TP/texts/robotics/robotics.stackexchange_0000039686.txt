Q:

Error building with OpenCV Dependency

I'm trying to build a package on Electric that uses OpenCV but I am getting an error saying I don't have OpenCV 2.3.2. I'm fairly new to Ubuntu so I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. Can anyone give me some pointers. Here is the error I recieve when running rosmake on my package.
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`rospack find rosbuild`/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

Kevin, There is nothing in the CMakeLists.txt file, but the manifest.xml has "" I just made a new package with the dependencies I need and tried to make it. I haven't put any real code into it yet.

A:

What are you building? :) A quick check of opencv says 2.3.1 is the current version out and 2.4 Beta is out. I haven't heard of 2.3.2 before. What does the CMakeLists.txt file say ... find_package(OpenCV 2.3.1 REQUIRED)? If it says 2.3.2 then try changing that to 2.3.1 and do a "make clean" first.
