Q:

[MoveIt!] How to Use the Python Move Group Interface

Hi,
I want to use MoveIt! for pathfinding for a simple manipulator arm.
The MoveIt! Setup Assistant and Rviz Integration tutorials were very helpful for the first usage of MoveIt! with the manipulator arm.
So far I can calculate paths between predefined poses using the Motion Planning extension. for Rviz
However, I now want to want to define a point in cartesian space. MoveIt! should then calculate a fitting manipulator pose itself and present a possible path from the current pose to the goal if there exists one.
I figured that this should be possible through the Move Group Interface of MoveIt! which I would then like to use with Python. This  tutorial coveres this problem, I think.
But I have no idea how to implement this for my own robot simulation.
Could someone explain me the steps that need to be done to transfer the tutorial on a different robot?

Hi
I am not very skilled with python but I am using move_group with c++. For implementig that tutorial on your robot. You just need to change this command.
group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("left_arm")

Instead of "left_arm" you should put name of your planning group which you specified in moveit_setup_assistant
Next important thing is to change desired goal to the real position which could your manipulator really reach.
pose_target = geometry_msgs.msg.Pose()
pose_target.orientation.w = 1.0
pose_target.position.x = 0.7
pose_target.position.y = -0.05
pose_target.position.z = 1.1
group.set_pose_target(pose_target)

Remember as it was mentioned in tutorial trajectory will be just planned and not executed
Whole code could be found here https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_pr2/blob/indigo-devel/pr2_moveit_tutorials/planning/scripts/move_group_python_interface_tutorial.py
When you will running code remember that your move_group should be running.

Thanks for the answer.
Is my move_group running when I visualize the manipulator using Rviz?
So I would then only have to use:
$ rosrun myscript.py
To execute the script?
I get errors saying that the topic shut down unexpected, when I do this.

your move group should be running when you call
roslaunch robot_moveit_config demo.launch

"robot_moveit_config" is name of your package you setuped in setup_assistant. If it still does not work you can send me your "robot_moveit_config" and I could try to move robot on my own using python
