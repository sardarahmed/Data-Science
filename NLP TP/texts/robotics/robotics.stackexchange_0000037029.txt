Q:

Absolute path in rosdep.yaml

Hi,
I would like to wrap an external library in a package. I want to download and build the code in  the same directory the package resides. Is it possible to find out the absolute path to the package in the corresponding rosdep.yaml script? If I try the bash command dirname in rosdep.yaml (i.e. echo "$(dirname $(readlink -f $0))") it gives the /tmp directory instead of the actuall directory in which the rosdep.yaml script resides. Im using ROS Electric under Ubuntu 11.04.
Thanks,
-Robert-

A:

You can use the "rospack" command to find the location of your package. If your package's name is called "extlib" you would use:
rospack find extlib
