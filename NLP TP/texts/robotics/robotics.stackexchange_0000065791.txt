Q:

Ubuntu 12.04 on PR2 is unable to install libfreenect-dev

Hello,
I am working on a PR2 robot (hydro) and I would like to install libfreenect-dev to develop a package for rgbd (kinect) mapping. However, I cannot install this library.
I receive the message "E: Package 'libfreenect-dev' has no installation candidate" from the apt-get manager.
I could install it in my workstation (running the same configuration: ubuntu 12.04, ROS hydro) but not in the PR2.
I looked this library into the ros repositories (from the PR2) but I couldn't find it.
Have you experienced this before? Do you have any clue how to install it or why is it not available for the PR2 platform?
I would appreciate your help.

A:

Does your sources list have this line:
http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe
The only way it won't be found is if it can't locate the package, because it is there for precise.
