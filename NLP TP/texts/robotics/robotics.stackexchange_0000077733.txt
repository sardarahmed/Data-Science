Q:

Python error when try Autonomy pack on RosHydro

I run a launch file for irobot-create2 (https://github.com/AutonomyLab/create_autonomy ) then faced issue, I think that is related to python.
My setup: 

Ubuntu LS12.04 
Ros Hydro 
irobot create2 

First I run without ca_description/launch/create_2.launch 
$ roslaunch ca_driver create_2.launch [desc:=false] [publish_tf:=true] 
--> it start communication with irobot. 
Next I run launch file  ca_description/launch/create_2.launch 
--> OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error 
Traceback (most recent call last):

This seems like there are problems with access rights or the shebang. crate_2.launch just starts one node, robot_state_publisher and it uses xacro to evaluate the urdf. Is xacro installed? From source? Did you copy something over using a windows PC? Did you change the launchfile?

Hi,
I try to check xacro file 
rosrun xacro xacro.py ~/dev/catkin_ws/src/create_autonomy/ca_description/urdf/create_2.urdf.xacro 
output err as below : 
 xacro.XacroException: Some parameters were not set for macro xacro:create_base

**Comment by [science00000](https://answers.ros.org/users/25431/science00000/) on 2016-12-08**:\
In file  create_base.urdf.xacro 
the parameter wheel_separation not set to specific value 
I try set one but have another err 

xacro.XacroException: Invalid parameter "wheel_separation" while expanding macro "xacro:create_base"

**Comment by [science00000](https://answers.ros.org/users/25431/science00000/) on 2016-12-09**:\
Hi mig I have modified launch file for debug then have error  --> OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error  thanks you :)

A:

Maybe it has something to do with macro default parameters added in Indigo (not in Hydro)? I guess xacro would not be happy with this line in particular. You could try removing all the parameters that have a default and just hardcode the values in create_base_gazebo.urdf.xacro.
