Q:

Light through the wall in a custom model

I create a model of a room on blender.
Then I position some spot lights in my scene, but they pass over the wall.
The wall is modelled with a normal plane.
What can be the cause of this?

Did you find a solution?

A:

Unfortunately, this is currently a limitation of spotlights in Gazebo. There is an issue ticketed for this, you could vote for it so it starts getting more attention.
Meanwhile, you could try using directional lights, if possible.
