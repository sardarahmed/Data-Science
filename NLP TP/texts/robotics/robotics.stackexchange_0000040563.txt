Q:

roscore failed to start

Hi there. Recently I came across a problem with roscore. The only thing I can tell is the following log:
irobot@irobot-desktop:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/turtlesim$ roscore
... logging to /home/irobot/.ros/log/a375ca62-9fcd-11e1-9063-4025c2c905d8/roslaunch-irobot-desktop-16615.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/__init__.py", line 257, in main
    p.start()
  File "/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/roslaunch/parent.py", line 257, in start

    code, msg, val = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy(self.uri).get_pid()

    return self.single_request(host, handler, request_body, verbose)

    connection.putrequest("POST", handler, skip_accept_encoding=True)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'putrequest'

Bellow is a script to import system variables at start up:
#!/bin/sh
source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash
source /usr/share/gazebo-1.0.0/setup.sh
export ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
export PATH=$ROS_ROOT/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/ros/fuerte/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
export ROS_WORKSPACE=~/ros_workspace
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/ros_workspace:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
export ROS_PARALLEL_JOBS=-j4
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
echo ROS_MASTER_URI=$ROS_MASTER_UR

Does anyone have any ideas what is wrong? Thanks.

What OS are you on? Did you install from .debs? Have you tried with just doing "source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash"... you shouldn't need to set the rest of those variables just to get a roscore to start (and things like ROS_ROOT, PYTHONPATH, etc should be configured by /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash)

You should not be doing this in a setup script.  For anybody who finds this in the future, setting some of these variables may be unsupported and break things.  You should be using ROSWS, in general.

I'm using Ubuntu 11.10, installed based on instructions http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu, all export are done in setup.sh file which loads from .bashrc, . How should I use rosws applied to this problem? I'm about to remove whole ROS installation and install it again.

A:

It looks like you have a problem inside your xmlrpclib installation.  It's implying that connection is of NoneType which is bad.  Do you have a nonstandard version of xmlrpclib?
