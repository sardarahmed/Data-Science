Q:

Ubuntu 64bit 11.10 + Kinect

I installed ROS and trying to run RBGDSLAM using Kinect. There was some issues installing drivers (such as changing openjava7 to sun java6 for compiler)
lsusb does not show camera and audio.
When I connect usb and run command
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
---output
INFO] [1329185066.431671629]: [/openni_node1] No devices connected.... waiting for devices to be connected
-------output for lsusb

I am not sure why it is only showing the Motor on usb port.
Thank you in advance.

A:

It looks like you might not have the 12V power supplied to the Kinect.  There should be three Microsoft devices listed.
