Q:

XBee Network Error

I am working with the XBee Network Example on the wiki (using ROS Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04 with Series 1 XBees) but I can't get further than setting up the XBees. Has anyone successfully got the example working? I get this error after entering the command
rosrun rosserial_xbee xbee_network.py /dev/ttyS0 1
RosSerial Xbee Network
Contacting Xbees :  ['\x00\x01']
Exception in thread Thread-6:

What port is your xbee connected to?

/dev/ttyS0

A:

I had a (mostly) working XBee network going with ROS Hydro. But when I upgraded to Indigo last night, I got this error immediately. I haven't found any solution yet
Edit: I just removed all the ros-indigo-rosserial-* packages, and copied my old rosserial from Hydro to Indigo. Now working fine.
