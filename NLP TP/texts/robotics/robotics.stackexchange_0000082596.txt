Q:

how to build the velodyne_indigo package for kinetic

Hi,
I am a noob to ROS, but am well along in the tutorials. I have a velodyne puck lite and would like to get it working on ROS kinetic. I could install ROS indigo but that would require changing my version of ubuntu to one that is supported by ROS indigo. Could anyone tell me step by step what to do to build this package manually on  xenial?
Also, any opinions on if it would be easier to just install an older version of Ubuntu would be helpful?
Thanks

A:

You can install the package from source rather than binary. If you look on the Github page for the repository it states that it works with ros kinetic. To do this:
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws/src
git clone -b master https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne.git
cd /path/to/your/catkin_ws
catkin_make

You may have to install some dependencies etc, but the package should build fine. If you're unfamiliar with the catkin build system, have a look at the tutorials here.

I would insert a rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths /path/to/your/catkin_ws --ignore-src right before catkin_make. That will take care of "install[ing] some dependencies etc".

Yep good point. I don't use rosdep but a good tool for beginners and making installs easier.

How do you deal with dependencies of packages that you want to build from sources then?
Manually?
Comment by ufr3c_tjc on 2017-09-03:
Yeah manually. I like to work through and install manually just to keep clear in my head what needs what etc.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-09-04:
Then perhaps substituting check for install might be interesting.
Although I don't really see the appeal of installing things manually, I do like to know what is going on, so I always run with check first.
