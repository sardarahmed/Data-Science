Q:

How to test a ros package

My goal is to check if a ROS package has been installed from source correctly and can work without any error.
So I'm looking for a common way to do such a test.
I've downloaded the source code of the ROS Base and some other ROS packages from the github and I can see that there is a directory named test in most of packages, such as src/geometry/tf/test/, src/actionlib/test/. But I don't know how to use these test directories.
So is there some common way to do test for each package? If there is not, does it mean that I have to read all of source code and code some test cases by myself to test ROS packages?

A:

You can run all tests by calling catkin_make run_test. See the catkin documentation for more info.
Obviously, this just runs all defined/implementes tests and cannot guarantee that it "can work without any error" (though you should be pretty safe with the core packages).
Note that you need to call catkin_test_results as specified on the link above to actually get the results of all tests that have run.
