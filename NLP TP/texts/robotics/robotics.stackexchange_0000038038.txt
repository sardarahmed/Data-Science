Q:

Best practices: checking a path with Costmap2DROS

Hi,
I have a populated Costmap2DROS object and a vector of poses which make up the robot's path.  I need to verify that on every pose, the robot is not in collision.
It should be sufficient to check whether the pose lies within the robot's inscribed radius, although if the computational load is light enough I could check the robot's footprint.
What are the best practices for doing this with a Costmap2DROS? I have found that I can make a copy of the underlying costmap, but this seems inefficient.
Thanks!

A:

You should be able to use the CostmapModel class in the base_local_planner package to allow you to check if a given pose is in collision. You can find documentation on the class here.
