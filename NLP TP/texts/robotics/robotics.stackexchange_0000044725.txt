Q:

ros java client only

Is there a way to just build and use just a ros java messaging client - do I need to build the entire rosjava_core?

A:

A "messaging client" isn't as simple as you might think. While you may be able to strip out some parts, I believe you'll want to use the whole rosjava_core.
