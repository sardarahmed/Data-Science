Q:

Cross compile some nodes for friendly arm mini2440

Hi! I have a small robot build on friendly arm mini2440 which have Wireless LAN.Now I want to build some driver nodes on it so that it can communicate with roscore. And send some sensor data use some topics.And controlled by provide some services.
Now, I am using my nodes on PC to communicate with the robot using TCP,and then get data and control
robot.
Can't I just build this nodes using ROS on my Ubuntu12.04, or I should cross compile the whole ROS
using the cross compile tool chain, and then cross my nodes.

A:

If the friendly arm supports Ubuntu, you should be able to compile and run ROS nodes on it.
I suggest you start with the debs for Ubuntu ARM: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/UbuntuARM
