Q:

Why sendGoal is called with one parameter

sendGoal is defined with 4 parameters in simple_action_client.h but while using this API we call it with one parameter viz send Goal(goal). Why ?
Following is how it is defined in simple_action_client.h
void SimpleActionClient<ActionSpec>::sendGoal(const Goal& goal,
                                              SimpleDoneCallback     done_cb,
                                              SimpleActiveCallback   active_cb,
                                              SimpleFeedbackCallback feedback_cb)

A:

In simple_action_client.h it's defined like this:
void sendGoal(const Goal& goal,
                SimpleDoneCallback     done_cb     = SimpleDoneCallback(),
                SimpleActiveCallback   active_cb   = SimpleActiveCallback(),
                SimpleFeedbackCallback feedback_cb = SimpleFeedbackCallback());

In C++ you can specify default function argument value with = sign. It's an optional value and therefore doesn't need to be present while calling that function. If you don't specify one it will take the default value (e.g. SimpleDoneCallback()).

@Raj it's still not checked. Click on the checkmark itself (it will turn green) to indicate that it's resolved.

@tfoote I did and it's showing green to me.

Are you sure you got the check mark and not the upvote arrow? If you mouse over it should say "mark this answer as correct"

No worries, there's always a learning curve for new interfaces. I'm glad you got your question answered quickly.

What does the up arrow near comments mean ?

It's an upvote to vote for one answer versus another. It's useful if there are many answers to a question and you find one useful you can upvote it even if you weren't the person who asked it.
