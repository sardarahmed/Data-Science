Q:

problem for loading robot pr2 model

Dear All.
while I try to Starting the Manipulation Pipeline. I just based on the following website:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_tabletop_manipulation_apps/Tutorials/Starting%20the%20Manipulation%20Pipeline
The step is:

rosmake pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch
roscore
export ROBOT=sim
roscd pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch
modify the pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch
just

    
-->
Just make it connect as a client for object database running on remote server at Willow Garage
6 cd ~
7. roslaunch pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch
The I got the following information:
Mainly is said that :
[ERROR] [1329418027.455848865]: Robot model '/robot_description' not found! Did you remap 'robot_description'?
[ WARN] [1329418027.463987029]: Models not loaded
[FATAL] [1329418027.466372646]: Could not load the xml from parameter server: robot_description
[ERROR] [1329418027.466448443]: Could not load robot model. Are you sure the robot model is on the parameter server?
do I need more step to run this demo?
I am using ubuntu 11.04 or 10.04, 64 bit electric ros. The problems are the same.
Thanks for any help.
Best regards.
Zhenli

A:

Answer by myself:
I should run pr2 simulator.
The steps:
1. roscore
2. export ROBOT=sim
3.roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch
4. Here you also load the object table.cup
5. modify the pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch just
6. roslaunch pr2_tabletop_manipulation_launch pr2_tabletop_manipulation.launch

Hi zhenli, I also have the same problem and my approach is quite similar to run this demo. I'm using ROS fuerte and Ubuntu LTS 12.04. But I used local database. However, the result gives some errrors and hanging: waitForService: Service [/register_planning_scene] has not been advertised, waiting...
