Q:

cannot ping [/my_turtle]: unknown node

working the tutorials, all went well until
[code]
rosnode ping my_turtle
[/code]
got back
[code]
rosnode: node is [/my_turtle]
cannot ping [/my_turtle]: unknown node
[/code]
Verified path, network setup, etc all went exactly as described until ping.  First time working with ROS, what should I look at next?
edit:
went back through tutorial, but before changing name of turtlesim to my_turtle, pinged turtlesim and it worked fine.
regards, Richard

A:

Judging from your edit I'm guessing you are pinging the wrong name. View the running nodes with rosnode list.
