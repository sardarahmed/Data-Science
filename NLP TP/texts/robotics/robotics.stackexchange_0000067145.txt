Q:

knowrob_cad_parser in indigo

Hi,
I am interested to use knowrob_gui package (catkin-based version in indigo) and it depends on the knowrob_cad_parser package.
Could you please let me know whether you implemented this parser package in indigo based on catkin ?
Regards

In order to load some models through RoboEarth, do you have any instruction or materials indicating how to fill "Room Number", "Floor Number", "Street Number",  and "Street Name" ?

Please start a new question for new topics. Cf. RoboEarth: Please have a look at the deprecated  documentation [here])http://knowrob.org/doc/exchanging_information_via_roboearth). The servers seem to be down though, I don't have access and cannot promise anything regarding their uptime.
