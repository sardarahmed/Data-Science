Q:

rqt_graph not working anymore on galactic

I had this problem for a while now, and wasn't able to solve it despite all attempts, rqt_graph used to work just fine, but all the sudden (probably after i installed something or updated something) started giving me this Error:
anassq@anassq-ThinkPad:~$ rqt_graph

I tried everything i can find, setting the pyQt by sudo pip3 install pyqt5==5.15.5
didn't work removing and reinstalling package didn't work either.
I hope someone here ran to a simular problem and found a solution, or can provide me with some suggestions.
Thanks for the read!
