Q:

Python source for built-in message types

Where can I find Python source code for the built-in message types? I need them for a presentation. I've looked for them but I guess that they are not on GitHub but that they are generated during builds.
Specifically for the moment I am looking for Twist

A:

The message types are generated into the devel directory of your workspace (like other things that your source code wants to include), under devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/. The built-in ones are in the install directory, so since you are on kinetic, most likely /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/.
PS: find . -name std_msgs helped.

@pitosalas: this is the answer to your question.
If it isn't, then please clarify why you haven't accepted it yet.
All msg packages can be found in the directories that @fvd mentions, including geometry_msgs.

Yes, I found it. I was mistakenly looking in std_msgs. Thanks all!
