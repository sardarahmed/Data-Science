Q:

Is there a way to modify the default camera position in the world file?

I would like to move the camera position to something other than what it defaults to.  How would I go about this in the world file?  There is some documentation but it is vague.
Here is the code I am using changing the camera pose does nothing.  I needed to put a name in for the camera, because it would not parse otherwise:
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.3">
    <world name="default">
   <gui>
      <camera name="user_default">
            <pose>-1 0 -2 0 -5 0</pose>
      </camera>
    </gui>    
<scene>
<shadows>false</shadows>
</scene>    

        <include>
            <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
        </include>
        <include>
            <uri>model://sun</uri>
        </include>
        <include>
            <uri>model://robopede</uri>
        <name>robot</name>
            <pose>-2.5 0 0 0 0 0</pose>
        </include>
        <include>
            <uri>model://wall</uri>
            <name>wall_0</name>
            <pose>-3 0.22 0 0 0 0</pose>
        </include>
    <include>
            <uri>model://wall</uri>
            <name>wall_1</name>
            <pose>-3 -0.22 0 0 0 0</pose>
        </include>
               <include>
            <uri>model://wall</uri>
            <name>wall_2</name>
            <pose>-2 0.22 0 0 0 .5</pose>
        </include>
    <include>
            <uri>model://wall</uri>
            <name>wall_4</name>
            <pose>-2 -0.22 0 0 0 .5</pose>
        </include>

    </world>
</sdf>

This is very annoying in the new gazebo.  Can someone post their code to move the camera?  I tried the   setting, but i cannot get it to work.  I am most likely doing something wrong

A:

<sdf version='1.3'>
  <world>
    <gui>
      <camera>
        <pose>my custom pose as a six-tuple(x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw)</pose>
      </camera>
    </gui>    

  </world>
</sdf>

Is this documented anywhere? sdformat.org lists nothing. What is the default orientation that roll/pitch/yaw effects?
Comment by chapulina on 2015-05-03:
I couldn't find it documented, but the pose is described with respect to the world. 0 0 0 0 0 0 is centered at world origin looking towards the positive X axis with Z up and Y to the left. Note that the initial camera pose is not zero.

With SDF1.4, data format is as what @chapulina mentions. I think tuple (that can be commonly embraced in parenthesis) stated in the answer might be a bit confusing.
Comment by okan on 2018-06-30:
I do not know when that changed, but camera tag needs to have name attribute otherwise SDF parse gives error. It should be like  .. 
Also it would be beneficial to mention that the pose x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw will be separated from each other with space not comma. Another trick to set an appropriate camera position would be moving the camera by running the simulation and getting required pose by selecting the GUI on the model explorer.
