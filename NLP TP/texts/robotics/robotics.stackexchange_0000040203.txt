Q:

pcl in ros fuerte: missing headers?

If I install PCL 1.5.1 from source or by using the debian packages provided on pointclouds.org, the io directory is as follows:
/usr/include/pcl-1.5/pcl/io:

file_io.h  impl  lzf.h     oni_grabber.h  openni_grabber.h  pcd_io.h            ply_io.h  vtk_lib_io.h
grabber.h  io.h  obj_io.h  openni_camera  pcd_grabber.h     pcl_io_exception.h  vtk_io.h

However, the fuerte package is missing some of these headers, including openni_grabber.h.
/opt/ros/fuerte/include/pcl-1.5/pcl/io:

file_io.h  impl  lzf.h     pcd_grabber.h  pcl_io_exception.h  vtk_io.h
grabber.h  io.h  obj_io.h  pcd_io.h       ply_io.h            vtk_lib_io.h

I'm on ubuntu 11.10. What's the reason for the discrepancy?

Same thing happened to me, PCL 1.5.1 from source on OSX. I think there is an error in their Makefiles.

Can you bring this up on ros-users?

A:

PCL from pointclouds.org has different openni_grabber framework and the openni_launch that ships with ROS is different. Both cannot exist and work simultaneously. Thus if you have pcl that ships with ROS, it works with openni_launch that can grab kinect data for you. I think its the same with the other headers/packages too.
