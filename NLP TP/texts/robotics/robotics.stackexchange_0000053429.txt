A:

If you're only interested in the latest messages and want to drop the rest, just set a queue_size of 1, when you create the subscriber.
Otherwise, you'll have to write your own data structure (queue, stack, std::vector) and continually spin to fill your data structure from the callbacks and process it in your own thread.  Be careful of thread safety.
