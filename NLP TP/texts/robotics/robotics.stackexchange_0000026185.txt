Dear all,
Can anyone have the draw of ATLAS links dimensions and DOF distribution and location?
Best!,

A:

Atlas is specified via URDF, its documentation with graphical illustrations can be found here.
The Atlas URDF starts out as a xacro macro, as indicated in the header, atlas.urdf.xacro uses macros defined in included atlas_simple_shapes.urdf and others to expand into atlas.urdf at compile time.
Basic idea reiterated here:
A Model is composed of a collection of rigid-body **Link**s and Joint constraints.  The transform between **Link**s are defined in corresponding Joint blocks.  So for example, take a look at this Joint block in atlas_simple_shapes.urdf.xacro:
<joint name="back_lbz" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="-0.0125 0 0" rpy="0 -0 0" />
    <parent link="pelvis" />
    <child link="ltorso" />
    ...
</joint>

Above basically says: The transform from pelvis Link frame to ltorso Link frame is defined by a linear translation of (-0.0125, 0, 0), followed by Euler rotation of (0, 0, 0) radians.
A set of c++ URDF data structures are described here and a corresponding parser is in urdfdom.
Visualization
One way to visualize URDF model is with [rviz](http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz).  Starting with this [DRC Tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/drcsim/2.2/visualizing_logging_data), you can add a `TF` object:

which will display Link frames:
