Q:

Problem installing uvc_cam on ARM/Hydro

Trying to do a uvc_cam install on a Panda Board under hydro following the Ros By Example instructions.  I get 55 successes and one failure.  the Package path is correct and roscd finds the correct source directory in ros_workspace.  I did call rosdep update and tried again with the same failure message.
I am guessing I am missing a dependency, but not sure which.
Here is the build log:
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
make: *** [all] Error 1

Worked for me when I used catkin.

A:

some packages not install.
[rospack] Error: package/stack 'uvc_cam' depends on non-existent package 'driver_base' and rosdep claims that it is not a system dependency.
apt-cache search ros-hydro-driver-base, find the package and install it.
some packages else also not install, do the same thing
