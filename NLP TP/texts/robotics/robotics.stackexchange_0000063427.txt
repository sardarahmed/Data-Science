Q:

Where can I find the package turtlebot_bringup?

I am following this tutorial, directly after set up through this tutorial. I am using ROS indigo.
When attempting to run the command
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
I get an error stating that minimal.launch is not a launch file, and neither is turtlebot_bringup.
roscd cannot find turtlbot_bringup.
I tried installing the package using
rosinstall ~/ros https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turtlebot/turtlebot/indigo/turtlebot.rosinstall
but it didn't appear to do anything.
