Q:

side scan sonar

Hi,
I'm working on an underwater robot simulator.
The dynamic and control parts are covered and I am now trying to simulate side-scan sonars, as it is a commonly used sensor in AUV.
Are there any ROS packages that already simulate this kind of sensors?
I found a few papers on the theory, but nothing usable without recoding all the ray tracing.
Thanks.

A:

Generation of this kind of sensor data has to be performed inside the simulator, so IÂ´m not sure how a existing ROS package could help you there. Gazebo provides a RaySensor that can be used inside plugins to generate simulated sensor data for your ROS robot, but as you are working on your own simulator this probably can only serve as inspiration.

Yep, I'm actually using Gazebo, just added buoyancy and other hydro effects to deal with the underwater environment. I'll look into this RaySensor as a base for a sidescan sonar plugin.
Thanks!
