Q:

Couldn't find executable below /home/leroy/catkin_ws/tum_ardrone

Hi,
i am fairly new to this, but whatever i try i cant seem to fix or see the problem here.
i have a catkin workspace:  catkin_ws
i`ve installed the tum_ardrone package accordingly:

cd catkin_ws
git clone git://github.com/tum-vision/tum_ardrone.git -b hydro-devel
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:catkin_ws/tum_ardrone tum_ardrone -b hydro-devel
cd tum_ardrone
rosmake tum_ardrone

added this to my .bashrc file: export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/catkin_ws:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}
and : source /home/leroy/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
when using rosmake it gives me a load of messages: "No Makefile in package catkin"  this goes for every package
i noticed there wasnt a makefile. so i tried adding one manually with this line in it: include $(shell rospack find mk)/cmake.mk    this still doesn`t change anything
when i am trying to run any of the 3 nodes in this package i get the following error: "Couldn't find executable below /home/leroy/catkin_ws/tum_ardrone"
ive also found a solution on this site where was stated that rosmake doesnt alway coop with catkin and therefore sometimes only make needs to be used. this gives me the following:

cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros/core/rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..

A:

There are two central concepts which you must firstly understand before attempting to do what you are doing.
Firstly, you are mixing up catkin and rosbuild workspaces/build systems. When using catkin workspaces, you should run the command catkin_make to build the packages within the given workspace.
Secondly, the source of all ROS packages compatible with catkin must be in catkin_ws/src/, and not in the root folder of your workspace.
See this link for further information.
I hope it helps!
