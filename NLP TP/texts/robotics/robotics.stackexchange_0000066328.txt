Q:

Including pcl_ros for transformPointCloud

Hi,
So I'm trying to use pcl_ros method:
transformPointCloud (const std::string &target_frame, const sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 &in, sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 &out, const tf::TransformListener &tf_listener)

from http://docs.ros.org/api/pcl_ros/html/namespacepcl__ros.html
But I'm not sure what pcl_ros/... to include. Like msot things, it doesn't seem to be under #include <pcl_ros/point_cloud.h>

A:

Use
#include <pcl_ros/transforms.h>

You can find documentation for pcl_ros in ROS Inidigo at docs.ros.org. I found that page by googling for pcl_ros transformpointcloud. The linked file says that the function pcl_ros::transformPointCloud() is defined in transforms.hpp.

Keep in mind that you WILL need to have PCL installed, as this header is dependent on pcl/common/transforms.h
