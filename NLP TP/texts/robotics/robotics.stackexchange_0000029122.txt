Q:

How to get sim time in ignition gazebo

Is it possible to get the sim time outside of the update callbacks in ignition gazebo? Ie is there an equivalent of physics::World::SimTime()?

A:

You could subscribe to the /clock topic. Otherwise, you can get it during an update and store at a local variable.
SimTime was kept out of ignition::gazebo::World on purpose, so users would get it from the update callbacks. More info on this tutorial.
