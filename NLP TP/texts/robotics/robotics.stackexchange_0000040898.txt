Q:

how to use kinect data without rviz or rgdslam

Hello everyone,
I'm a totally newbie in ros and qt, and I would like to make a GUI in QT with a window showing a pointcloud image and another window showing a normal image, and after I might try to add some control but my issue is that I really don't know which way I have to take.
I've starting to do almost all the tutorials I found interesting for my purpose, and now I'm starting to read rviz code to understand how I can extract images from the kinect.
I've been looking for something like my idea everywhere but I didn't find anything.
Should I continue to read rviz code? I'm kind of scared when I see all this lines...
Thanks for the help.
Cheers
(I'm using ros electric with ubuntu).

A:

You should probably upgrade to fuerte, as rviz has been ported to QT and modularized with this new distro. The Librviz Tutorial looks like it is very relevant (and in parts similar) to what you describe.

Is there other tutorials that this one? because I didn't succeed to add a point cloud in my grid or when I add an Image Display, this one creates a new window...
