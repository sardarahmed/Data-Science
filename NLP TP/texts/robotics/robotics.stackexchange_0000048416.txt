Q:

catkin_package() include dir neither an absolute directory nor exists relative to workspace

I am trying to convert camera1394 to catkin. My working repository is this master branch.
Perhaps foolishly, I am attempting this migration by hand, using only the documentation I can find on-line. That has not been easy or pleasant, but I wanted to see if I could do it.
When trying to build by itself on Precise in a catkin workspace based on Groovy, I get this failure:
$ catkin_make

I don't know how to set this. The camera1394 package has no include/ subdirectory, since it exports no header files. I've tried many different ideas, but really have no clear concept what this message is complaining about.

A:

This particular message seems to come from dynamic_reconfigure generation.
The fix is to change the cfg file. In place of:
from dynamic_reconfigure.parameter_generator import *

catkin packages should use:
from dynamic_reconfigure.parameter_generator_catkin import *

Hello, I have encountered a similar problem. Can you indicate to me how can I access the cfg files. There are many cfg files.

Hard to answer that without more information. Would you please open a new question (which can link to this one) and provide details about the cfg files causing you trouble?

Thanks joq. I fixed the error. I just made an include folder inside src and did the catkin_make and it compiled. I asked this questions originally on this page with the specifications (http://answers.ros.org/question/65285/rviz-tutorial-error-dir-include-is-neither-an-absolute-directory-nor-exists/
