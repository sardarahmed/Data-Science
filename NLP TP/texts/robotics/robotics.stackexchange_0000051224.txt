Q:

Raspberry Pi TurtleSim Build Error

Hello everyone, I just got a raspberry pi and started following the debian build instructions with the raspberry pi changes listed on the wiki. (I can't link them as this is my first post) When I go to make the code I get the following error message:
[ 61%] Built target mimic

[ 61%] Built target turtlesim_genlisp
[ 62%] Built target turtlesim_genpy

make: *** [all] Error 2

I've searched around, and haven't been able to find a working solution for this problem. Does anyone know what's going on?
Thanks!

I haven't yet been able to build the packages properly. I moved my work onto a virtual machine for making the packages. I'd suggest using the available repository if those packages will do what you need.

A:

The solution i found for this problem is to edit the file turtle.cpp (mentioned in the error ) and replace 0.0 in the file with qreal(0.0) and it will compile fine after that
