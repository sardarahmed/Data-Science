A:

Yes, if you are using the xbox controller with the wireless adapter, it will work. However, when you connect the wireless usb adapter dongle to your computer, you will actually see 4 joysticks connected (/dev/js0 -- /dev/js3). I believe it should automatically be js0 but you will have to try it yourself.
