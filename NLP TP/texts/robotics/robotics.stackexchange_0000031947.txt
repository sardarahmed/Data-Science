Q:

smach_viewer problem

Hi,
smach_viewer is reporting an error when I'm trying to visualize my state machine. It's displaying the state machine correctly and I can see the states changing, but when it gives me the following error message: http://pastebin.com/rfp7N914.
state_machines_library is not my package, it's just a subdirectory in my package src directory where I put some state machines.
Cheers,
Ugo

I'm using diamondback.  The executive_smach version is 1.0.1

Which ros distribution are you using? What is the version of the executive_smach stack (see the CMakeList.txt file in the executive_smach root folder).

A:

Below is the relevant part of the smach code that is failing. It does not look very robust to changes in the exception. I created a ticket here. Could you post details about the ros/smach/python version you were using?
try:
self._local_data._data = pickle.loads(msg.local_data)
break
except ImportError as ie:
# This will only happen once for each package
modulename = ie.args[0][16:]
packagename = modulename[0:modulename.find('.')]
roslib.load_manifest(packagename)
