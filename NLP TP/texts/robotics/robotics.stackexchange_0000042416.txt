Q:

Binding RViz' view camera position and orientation to tf frame

Hello,
I am working on head-tracking application and utilizing RViz for visualization. I have 3 coordinate frames connected as /world -> /base -> /head.

/world - global frame
/base - head-tracker frame (fixed to /world)
/head - user's head frame in /base

The thing I am trying to achive is make user's head to be a 'camera' in 3D environment. Thus, I need to make /head frame to control RViz' viewport camera position and orientation. So far I managed only to bind /head frame position to the RViz camera by setting it to Target Frame. But frame orientation is ignored in this case.
Is there a way to control RViz camera orientation as well?
Thanks in advance,
Boris
UPDATE: Setting fixed frame to /world or /base does not help.
UPDATE 2:
$ rosrun tf tf_echo /world /base
At time 1342851117.156
- Translation: [0.000, 0.000, 0.500]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.500, 0.500, 0.500, 0.500]
            in RPY [1.570, -0.000, 1.570]

$ rosrun tf tf_echo /base /head

What type of view do you have rviz set to? Orbit? FPS? etc?
Comment by Boris on 2012-07-20:
I tried both Orbit and FPS, does make a big difference. I can see how /head frame is rotating with respect to RViz camera plane. However I need opposite effect - /head frame has to be completely fixed to RViz camera frame.
Comment by joq on 2012-07-21:
I am confused about your intention. Do you want the head and camera to stay fixed in rviz and the world to rotate as the head does?
Comment by Boris on 2012-07-23:
@joq: Yes, that's exactly what I need. Sorry for confusion.

A:

Looks like that "not recommended" option from Wiki suits my needs best, i.e. setting up both Target Frame and Fixed Frame to /head (moving frame).
P.S. I was ignoring this option thinking that view jittering is caused by such setup, but eventually it is because of head tracking errors.

saved my life, are there any "official" support from rviz for this kind of need?
