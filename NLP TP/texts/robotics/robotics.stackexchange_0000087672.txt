Q:

Sending Initial pose to the Navigation Stack?

Hello,
There is tutorial for Sending Goals to the Navigation Stack in Ros wiki here. Is it possible to do the same thing for the initial position of the robot? if yes, how could I extract the actual pose of the robot  first and then use it for this propose?
Thanks for helping me out?

A:

If you are using, like the tutorial, the base_link frame of the robot then the initial pose is always {0;0}.
If you want the initial pose of the robot within the map reference frame then you can use a tf listener between map and  base_link before moving the robot and save the coordinates to use them when you need.
