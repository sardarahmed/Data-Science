Q:

Connect to the parameter server from Windows?

Dear ROS users,
I am developing the system that user input is done in windows, and ubuntu + ROS system controls a robot based on the user input.
What I need is only to read/write parameters on ubuntu ROS's parameter server.
Since I use diamondback, I have difficult to develop ROS node in Windows. (Several library is linked in the program in Windows, and I cannot compile a few ROS nodes in Electric. )
Is there any way I can connect to the parameter server from Windows?
Best Regards

A:

Communication with the parameter server works through ordinary XMLRPC. Just use an XMLRPC library to communicate with the parameter server. The API is described here. A few basics including a Python example to communicate with the master are described here.
