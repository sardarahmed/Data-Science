Q:

youbot firmware error with youbot_HelloWorldDemo

I'm just getting started with a new youbot. I followed the manual instructions and built a few ros programs. When I try to run them I notice a few problems. Below is a log of the output and error messages I'm getting right now:
youbot@kukaros1:~/applications/hello_world_demo$ sudo ./youBot_HelloWorldDemo
Info: Initializing EtherCAT on eth0 with communication thread
Info: 5 EtherCAT slaves found
Info: BaseLeftFront      Controller Type: 1610  Firmware version: 148
Warning: The youBot base motor controller have to be of type: 174 or 1632
Warning: The ethercat slave number is not available!
Info: Done.

A quick scan of the youbot website didn't turn up any firmware images. Any ideas of how to resolve this issue?
I also don't get anywhere unless the arm is plugged in to eth0 and that seems weird to me. Any pointers welcome

A:

We hound that usb key derievered from Kuka would not function. As a workaround, following the set of instuctions here we were able to run diagnostics and do keyboard control:

I'll be interested in a similar process which works for Groovy.
