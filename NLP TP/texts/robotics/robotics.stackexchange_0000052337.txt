Q:

arm_navigation compilation error on fuerte

As stated on the wiki page http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation, I installed the sources of the package using:
hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/armnavigation/armnavigation -b default
Unfortunately, the compilation fails because the package mapping_rviz_plugin does not find the file rviz/properties/string_property.h.
This file does not exit in the repository  rviz/properties. FYI, I installed rviz from the command git clone https://github.com/ros-visualization/visualization.git -b visualization-1.8 as stated on the wiki http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz.
I tried to gather this header from different source on the web but it seems that the file collision_map_display.cpp needs more modifications.
Any hints to fix this ?
Is there a repository for stable sources ?

A:

The default branch you've checked out is for Groovy, and the RViz API has changed between Fuerte and Groovy. Just check out the Fuerte branch:
roscd arm_navigation
hg checkout fuerte

Thenks. I did not notice that the repository was the same for both releases.
