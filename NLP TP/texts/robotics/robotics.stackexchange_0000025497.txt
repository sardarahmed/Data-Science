Q:

Simple Method to Reload Model Plugins?

Is there a simple method to reload model plugins in Gazebo when they are recompiled?
I see PluginT<...>::Create() and ModelPlugin::Create() using dlfcn.h / ltdl.h, and was wondering if there currently is a technique to easily reload model plugins if the model is destroyed and a new one is created.

There currently is not a mechanism to do this.
I have created a feature request:
