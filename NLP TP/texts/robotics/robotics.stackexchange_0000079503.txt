Q:

How does rospy.get_time() work? Does it repeat if I restart roscore?

I am trying to collect data of different images and store them under the name as rospy.get_time(). I want to know if I stop collecting this data and restart it later, is there a chance that I will be getting the same rospy.get_time()?
How does the rospy.get_time() work? Is it based on wall clock time( and I am assuming that it is my PC's time)? Why does it always start with "14xxxxxx.xxx".
Please clarify!
Thanks!

A:

Is it based on wall clock time

If you don't set use_sim_time, then: yes.

Why does it always start with "14xxxxxx.xxx".

Because it is a unix timestamp which is just an integer representing "the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970" (wikipedia/unix_timestamp).
Everything after 1400000000 is any point in time after 2014-05-13T16:53:20+00:00 (converted here).
Finally, see wiki/Clock for some more info.
