Q:

catkin_make fails in tf tutorial

Following the TF tutorial http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF
catkin_make does not make the files. I tried catkin_make robot_setup_tf as well and get the following result:
dave@canbot:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make robot_setup_tf
Base path: /home/dave/catkin_ws
Source space: /home/dave/catkin_ws/src
Build space: /home/dave/catkin_ws/build
Devel space: /home/dave/catkin_ws/devel
Install space: /home/dave/catkin_ws/install

Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/dave/catkin_ws/build"

Running command: "make -j4 -l4 robot_setup_tf" in "/home/dave/catkin_ws/build"

make: *** No rule to make target `robot_setup_tf'.  Stop.
Invoking "make" failed

A:

First, make sure that you have sourced the workspace, i.e.
source %TOP_DIR_YOUR_CATKIN_WS%/devel/setup.bash

Second, check that you have created package in a right directory, i.e. %TOP_DIR_YOUR_CATKIN_WS%/src. I think there may be a mistake in tutorial, since it telling you to change to %TOP_DIR_YOUR_CATKIN_WS%.
Finally, if these are correct, and your package is within %TOP_DIR_YOUR_CATKIN_WS%/src, but you still cannot change to it with roscd robot_setup_tf, then do rospack profile and try again.
If you followed beginner tutorials then %TOP_DIR_YOUR_CATKIN_WS% will be ~/catkin_ws.
Hope it helps.
