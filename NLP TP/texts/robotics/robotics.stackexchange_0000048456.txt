Q:

read cmd_vel commands from a text file

Hello all,
Please, note that I'm a beginner in ROS. I'm using the turtlebot robot in gazebo. I know how to send a velocity command from the terminal, e.g., move forward 1m/s. But, What I would like is to send a sequence of consecutive commands. Would it be possible to read them from a text file, for example?
I hope my questions makes sense,
Thanks in advance

A:

I haven't worked with turtlebot or gazebo but the answer is almost certainly yes. The basic idea is that you want to read your text file line by line as you normally would in python/c++. Split each line into different values you want then publish these programmatically as Twist messages as explained in this tutorial http://pharos.ece.utexas.edu/wiki/index.php/Writing_A_Simple_Node_that_Moves_the_iRobot_Create_Robot#Create_the_Program. You should do all of this work inside a node which you start after your robot has started. Hope this helps.
