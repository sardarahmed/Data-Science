Q:

Element[joint:hinge] not defined in SDF

I'm trying to use the URDF from here:
https://github.com/aurofable/ros/blob/master/art-experimental/urdf/navgroup.urdf
When I run "gzsdf print car.urdf" [or spawn in gazebo] I get:
Error [parser.cc:697] XML Element[joint:hinge], child of element[model] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[model]
Error [parser.cc:688] Error reading element [model]
Error [parser.cc:348] Unable to read element [sdf]  
Error [parser.cc:273] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
Error: SDF parsing the xml failed
It doesn't like the joint:hinge inside of the gazebo tag. (It won't let me post the code here.)
joint:hinge appears to be valid:
http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Gazebo-manual-0.8.0-pre1-html/group_gazebo_hinge_joint.html
Is this a version problem? Or the structure of the URDF? I have been searching all day and haven't found a solution.
I am running indigo and Gazebo 2.2.6

I loaded Kinetic on VMware under ubuntu16.04. That came with Gazebo 7.0.0. Now when I run "gz sdf -p car.urdf" it lists the [joint::hinge] as warnings instead of errors. The model will spawn in Gazebo, but the links don't seem to be connected correctly. I will play with it some more and report back.

I gave up on the connect links and switched over to this project:
