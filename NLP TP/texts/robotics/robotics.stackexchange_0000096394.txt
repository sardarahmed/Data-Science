Q:

slam gmapping for ROS Noetic

Hello,
I wanted to know if the slam gmapping is available on ROS Noetic? I've tried doing:
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gmapping

And the terminal outputs:
Unable to locate package

When checking the ROS Wiki, I noticed that gmapping is still not available on Noetic, however, since this is a basic package, I wanted to know if there is any work around to get it.
Thank you in advance

I guess this is a similar situation as we had with Melodic. See #q327976 (and the linked #q300480.

however, since this is a basic package

Please realise that gmapping and related packages have been unmaintained for a long time now. See also my comments about this in #q300480.

A:

sudo apt install ros-noetic-slam-gmapping
