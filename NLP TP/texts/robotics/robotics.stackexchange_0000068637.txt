A:

joint state refers to sensor readings like actual position, velocity and effort.
A position controlled joint is a joint that can be commanded with joint position references. A similar reasoning applies to velocity- and effort-controlled joints.
A controllable joint typically reports its state (read from joint) and accepts motion commands (write to joint).
