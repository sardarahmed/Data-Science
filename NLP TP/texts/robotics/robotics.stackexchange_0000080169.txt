Q:

error message "could not find package 'ros-kinetic-desktop-full'"

Trying to install ROS both through the terminal and by clicking on the "click here" link.  In both cases I get an error message "could not find package 'ros-kinetic-desktop-full'".
What do I do now?
Thanks for your help.

A:

From this page:
Make sure to run
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

and
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116

and
sudo apt-get update

before running the installation command.
EDIT:
Now that we know that you are on Ubuntu 10.04, we can help you further. Ubuntu 10.04 are officially supported by ROS electric, which you can check out here. Of course, electric is long gone, so a better solution would be to install ROS kinetic from source, but be prepared to have (lots of?) dependency issues since you are using an outdated OS. I would strongly suggest to upgrade your OS if that's possible though.

I ran these.
The first of these asked me for my password but then didn't seem to do anything but give me back my command prompt.  The second and third returned information.
Same error message on install attempt. "Unable to locate package"
Thanks for the help, but still no joy

This is very weird. What is your OS? Maybe you are not on Ubuntu 16.04?
Comment by Zale on 2017-04-13:
No, I am on Ubuntu 16.04  That's not the problem.  I've checked for typos in my commands.  That doesn't seem to be the problem either.
Comment by gstavrinos on 2017-04-13:
What is your OS? You should be on 16.04 to use kinetic.
Comment by Zale on 2017-04-14:
Yes, OS 10.04 is my operating system.

Damn, that was a typo.  I am on ubuntu 16.04.  Sorry about that.  Don't know how that slipped past me.
