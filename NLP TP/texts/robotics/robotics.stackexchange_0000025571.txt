Q:

CloudSim server

Is it possible to install CloudSim on some local server too? From tutorials it's not clear to me... Thanks.

A:

It is possible to deploy CloudSim itself on a local machine.  We do that regularly for development and testing.  See the developer instructions.
But it's not possible to deploy a Gazebo installation onto a local machine using CloudSim.  That step will be done on a cloud-hosted machine.
