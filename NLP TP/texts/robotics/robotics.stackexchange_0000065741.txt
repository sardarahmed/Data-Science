Q:

Install indigo to ubuntu 14.04.2(testing)

I'm trying to install indigo to ubuntu 14.04.2, which is testing version of ubuntu trusty, but I met conflict with HWE packages from utopic as follows:
$ sudo aptitude install ros-indigo-rviz
The following NEW packages will be installed:

HWE packages are needed to run ubuntu 14.04 in my hardware.
How can I install indigo packages resolving the conflicts?

A:

If you're running the testing version of 14.04.2 with utopic backports it seems like they have not ironed out all the gl libraries for that case. You will probably need to dig in and try to manually select the dependencies you need, or push back upstream to make sure that the backports you are using are compatible. From your output we're not asking for any specific version so it's a conflict in your upstream apt sources.
