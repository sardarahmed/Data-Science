Q:

Difference between localisation with AMCL and SLAM

All,
Seemingly dumb question. If I have a SLAM map feeding the Navigation Stack, and therefore localising itself then what purpose does the localisation provided by AMCL provide? Just to localise within the costmaps?
Cheers
Mark

A:

a SLAM algorithm will localize the robot at the same time that it creates the map, possibly changing parts of the maps as it perform loop closures, also the origin of the map will change each time you start the SLAM algorithm.
AMCL will localize the robot at a previously created map, which guarantees that no changes will be done in the map and you will have always the same origin, as it has been previously recorded.

So if I have an existing map, where the environment of which might change then SLAM so that it can localise then update as necessary?

it depends on your application and on how much it changes. In my experience AMCL does a good job even if the environment changes significantly. With SLAM you may find yourself degenerating a good map due to errors in odometry too much dynamic objects, for example.

if you can explain us what your use case would be, that might help us to point you the best solution...
