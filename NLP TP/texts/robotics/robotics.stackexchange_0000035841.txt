Q:

How do I spawn a urdf object programmatically?

I take a .pcd file as input and process the pointcloud using pcl. I then want to spawn an object in Gazebo using the results of that processing so that I can simulate the manipulation of that object with a pr2. Is there a programmatic way to do this , i.e. using c++.

A:

When you spawn it in a launch file it works like this:
 <node name="spawned_object_name" pkg="gazebo" type="spawn_model" 
 args="-urdf -file $(find rospackagename)/path/to/file.urdf -model 
 object_name_from_gazebo_perspective  -x 0.50 -y 0.05 -z 0.65" 
 respawn="false" output="screen" /> 

If you look at
http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo/Tutorials/Gazebo_ROS_API
it tells you that there is also a ROS service gazebo/spawn_model which you can call programmatically through a ROS message - this seems like the right way to do it.
Here is the documentation of the service:
