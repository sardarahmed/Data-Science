Q:

Python versions of tutorials

In for example, http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/Odom , example is written in C++

I assume that just about any ROS program in C++ could be written in Python. True?
Is there a general way to find python equivalents to the specific examples used in ROS Tutorials? A catalog or other resource?

Thanks!

have you check the book for this ? if no please search Programming Robots with ROS: A Practical Introduction to the Robot Operating system

A:

Looking further I see that many of the tutorials have parallel steps for C++ and Pythong, displayed side by side in a table. I guess I just missed it. Sorry!
