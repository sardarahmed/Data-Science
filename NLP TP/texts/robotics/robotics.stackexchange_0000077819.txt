Q:

cannot find -lOpenNI2Orbbec. ROS Orbbec Astra camera

I'm trying to interface my Orbbec Astra camera using ROS (c++).
I figured out I need to use the custom OpenNI2 by Orbbec.
I built it according to the instructions.
Then I tried to build ros_astra_camera.
catkin_make --pkg astra_camera gives me /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lOpenNI2Orbbec
My CMakeLists.txt:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(camera)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  roscpp
  std_msgs
  message_generation
  image_transport
  cv_bridge
)
find_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )

 add_message_files(
   FILES
   TrackedPosition.msg
 )

 generate_messages(
   DEPENDENCIES
   std_msgs
 )

catkin_package(
  CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp std_msgs message_runtime
)

include_directories(
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

add_executable(tracker src/tracker.cpp)
target_link_libraries(tracker ${OpenCV_LIBRARIES} ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(tracker camera_generate_messages_cpp)

My package.xml:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package>
  <name>camera</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>
  <description>The camera package</description>

  <maintainer email="jeff@todo.todo">jeff</maintainer>

  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
  <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>

</package>

Any help is very much appreciated.
Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Are you suggesting to rename the library itself?
Comment by MarkyMark2012 on 2017-01-29:
You can simply add a sym link to the OpenNI2 library file. Calling the link libOpenNI2Orbbec or there abouts

There is no Astra OpenNI2 file in my /usr/lib
