Q:

Local navigation with additional rescrictions

Hi all,
my goal is to navigate a robot (locally - in odometry frame) using one laser scanner. Moreover I will have some additional restrictions - areas where the robot should not go. I found here two related questions (please let me know if I missed any):

Custom CostMap Values
Update costmap_2d with user defined no go zones

Generating artificial sensor data seems to be sufficient but bit hacky in my opinion... Is this something which might be solved using layered costmaps? Or is there any other good approach? Thanks in advance.

A:

As the author of the first question and layered costmaps, yes, layered costmaps are a good solution for the problem.

Ok, thanks for hint. Is there any documentation or examples how to work with layered costmaps?

This is the best I can point you to at the moment: http://ros.org/wiki/costmap_2d/hydro
