Q:

Error when "rosmake rgbdslam"

I have edited the question basing on the first answer.
Ubuntu 12.04 and Fuerte

Followed the wiki and resolved all the dependencies for rgbdslam_freiburg
rosdep install rgbdslam_freiburg

Then
nutan@nutan-HP-EliteBook-8460w:~/fuerte_workspace$ rosmake rgbdslam

The error goes this way........
mkdir -p bin
cd build && cmake -Wdev -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rospack find rosbuild/rostoolchain.cmake  ..
[rosbuild] Building package rgbdslam
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/fuerte/share/roscpp/rosbuild/roscpp.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/fuerte/share/roslisp/rosbuild/roslisp.cmake
[rosbuild] Including /opt/ros/fuerte/share/rospy/rosbuild/rospy.cmake
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:57 (find_package):
Could not find module Findg2o.cmake or a configuration file for package

Adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to find Findg2o.cmake or set g2o_DIR to the
directory containing a CMake configuration file for g2o.  The file will
have one of the following names:
g2oConfig.cmake
g2o-config.cmake

Please let me know what should be done..
