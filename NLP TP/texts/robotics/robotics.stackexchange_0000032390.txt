Q:

Small Single Board Computers suitable for ROS

Hi,
I've been wondering which SBC's do ROS users recommend. I'm particularly interested in

small designs (less or around 10x10cm)
lightweight (less than 200g, preferably around 100g)
high processing power, approx. 2GHz (single or multiple cores), 2GB RAM, or more
2 or more USB's
5V or 12V DC power supply
preferably x386
ROS Diamondback friendly, ie. supports Ubuntu 10.04 or newer.

I've used BeagleBoard with ROS, but unfortunately I found it's processing power to little for my needs. I'm also aware of PandaBoard, but, after playing around with BB-xM, I think x386 architectures will be better suited for fast prototyping. I'm also aware of AscTec's Atom Board, but I find it too expensive (AFAIK it costs 1200Eur + VAT in Germany). The option I'm considering now is IEI's PM-PV-D5251-R10, but the manufacturer is only assuring it's compatibility until Ubuntu 8.10 (but there is good chance newer versions will work out-of-the-box, I suppose) - costs around 400$.
Am I missing something worthy of knowing?
