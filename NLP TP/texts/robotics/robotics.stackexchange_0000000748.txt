Q:

How many amps do I want my Switching BEC to provide?

I'm trying to power 7-12 servos, and I was under the impression that each one would need about an amp, but in looking around for an appropriate BEC to supply them, I notice that most seem to output around 1-3.5 amps.
They won't all be running at once, but often, say 4 will be drawing enough juice to move.
Obviously, I'm missing some link in my understanding.  How do I determine how many amps will be needed from the power supply?

A:

Forgive me I seem to get caught up in people looking for answers to a question they didn't ask a few times already. So given this question; 
"How do I determine how many amps will be needed from the power supply?"
You can roughly guess it, in your case you say 4 servos drawing an amp each, 4 amps total.
Pick any BEC that will supply greater than 4 amps, there are plenty available from the other answer I already gave.
Then apply a logging circuit to validate your estimate; Make your own that logs both current and voltage, or buy a simple already build device that is made just for that purpose such as an Eagle Tree Logger
There is no magic formula to find correct amperage. Only real world usage and observation will give you a more precise estimate. Any such formula would not account for your mechanical design, friction, drag, gravity etc.
