Q:

Retrieve catkin build artificat path

Hello,
I'm building my first C++ ROS static library using Catkin, and I would like to link that library into an existing application which is being built with a Makefile.
So I would like to know if there is a way to use a ROS or Catkin command to retrieve the path of the built library and so I will not have to hardcode the path of the library in the -L flag.

A:

I think catkin_find is what you are looking at. catkin_find --help will tell you how to use it.

catkin_find --lib --first-only seems to be what I was looking for, even if I have to source my workspace setup.bash from my Makefile first :(
One more question, my devel/ folder contains the "lib" directory, but no "include" directory, any idea of why my library .h are not being copied ?
