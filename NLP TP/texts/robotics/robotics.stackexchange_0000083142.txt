Hello,
How to detect loop closures from the scan matched 2D data?
Thanks

A:

This is a non-trivial problem, two approaches doing this are implemented in open_karto and cartographer. For the latter, you can read about the clever branch-and-bound approach used in this paper.
In gmapping, there is no explicit detection of loop closures, but map hypotheses with "badly" matched parts get a low weight and get sampled out.

May i know how to solve using open_karto? Could you please elaborate the steps? What are the changes to be made in tha launch files to run my own datasets?
