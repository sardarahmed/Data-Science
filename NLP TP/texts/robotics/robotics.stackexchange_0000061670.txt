Q:

How to get clusters location in tabletop_object_detector?

Hello, I used tabletop_object_detector correctly in my own node and call the segmentation service and get the cluster size correctly. Now I need to get the location in XYZ of the segmented objects (clusters) but I don't know how.
Note: I use the segmentation node only without recognition facility.
Regards,

A:

The segmentation service just returns the points in the cluster.  If you want a representative 'location' for the clusters, you might find the bounding box and use that.  This service, for instance, can give you a bounding box based on 2-D PCA (z-axis is up, like you probably want on a table).  (You want the non-3d version for table objects.)
