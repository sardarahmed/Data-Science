Q:

missing run.py from rosjava_bootstrap

Hi,
I'm trying to do the "Getting started with NXT leJOS, using nxt_lejos_proxy" tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/nxt_lejos_proxy/Tutorials/Getting%20Started#Create_a_Scratch_Package), but when i run "roslaunch proxy.launch" I get this error:
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [rosjava_bootstrap/run.py]: Cannot locate node of type [run.py] in package [rosjava_bootstrap].
Looking into my rosjava_bootstrap folder there isn't any run.py file.
I've seen that this file is present in the rosjava electric-tag release (http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/source/browse/?name=electric-tag) but I don't know how to download it.
Can someone give a tip?
Thank you in advance,
Camilla

A:

leJOS had been updated to use the latest version of rosjava, but the tutorial had not been. The tutorial has now been updated.
