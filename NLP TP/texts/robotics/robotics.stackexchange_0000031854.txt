Q:

openni_node doesnt work

I tried next follows.

ubuntu 10.04LTS (working on VMware)
ROS Diamondback Fully install
Openni_Kinect install
https://openslam.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/data/svn/rgbdslam/trunk/README

but openni_node process has died ;(
what can i do for make sure?

juno@ubuntu:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks$  roslaunch rgbdslam kinect+rgbdslam.launch

Could you please retitle this question to something like Openni_node not working in VM? That way others with the same problem will be more likely to see this.

A:

OpenNI doesn't work in VMWare. No, I don't know why, but you're the third person (off the top of my head) to have this problem, and no solution is extant. The older (libfreenect-based) kinect drivers should work; if you do manual calibration, you'll end up in roughly the same place OpenNI gets you.

Do you mean you installed in on a bare-metal linux, rather than in a virtual machine?
