Q:

Pnumatic sulinoid with multiple outputs

I can't figure out what solenoid I would use. Everything I search for comes up with cylinders. Not sure if it's even a sulinoid that I need.
I'd like to have 8 hoses connected to a compressor. I'd like to control which hose releases air to push something off a conveyor belt. Like the image below. 

A:

You are searching for the wrong thing.
This is a solenoid

This is what you want, a solenoid operated valve.
