Q:

Rosdep Yaml Exact Folder

Is there a way to specify the exact location of my PCL-1-7 installation in a rosdep yaml file? I've installed PCL from source.
This is the ROS installation error related to it:
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
pcl_conversions: No definition of [libpcl-all] for OS [fedora]
pcl_ros: No definition of [libpcl-all] for OS [fedora]
I've tried with the yum pcl packages in Fedora but they don't seem to provide the right PCL version.

A:

rosdep interacts with package managers only.  So you cannot point it to a specific file/folder.
You can override the rosdep rule by creating your own rosdep file, which will set the rosdep resolution to an empty list if you want to manage the dependency manually.
When you have the file add it's path to your rosdep sources in /etc/ros/rosdep/
Then rosdep will not try to install pcl for you.

Empty list = []? Can you give an example?

Exactl. https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/rosdep/base.yaml#L1900 is an example

Thanks. That worked fine.
