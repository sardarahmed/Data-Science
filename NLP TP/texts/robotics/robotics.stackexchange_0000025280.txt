Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ROS fuerte sdf

I'm trying to switch between ROS electric and ROS fuerte. My problem is in launching the '.launch' file since the shell says that my model is deprecated (originally it was a '.xacro' file).
Does anybody know how to convert it into a new ROS format without rewriting by scratch my model?
Thank you,
Neostek
P.S. I also tried with the 'gzsdf' command following this guide
http://answers.ros.org/question/41766/gazebo-urdf-deprecated/
The real problem is the model misses some parts and the warning message Warning [parser.cc:348] Gazebo SDF has no gazebo element Warning [parser.cc:291] DEPRECATED GAZEBO MODEL FILE On July 1st, 2012, this formate will no longer by supported continues to appear

A:

The old Gazebo model files (prior to Gazebo 1.0) must be converted manually. ROS Electric used a version of Gazebo that was less than 1.0, so your world and model files must be converted manually.
