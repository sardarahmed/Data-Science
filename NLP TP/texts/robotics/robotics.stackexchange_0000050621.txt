Q:

Setting up KnowRob in Ubuntu 12.10 groovy

I install knowrob from
git clone http://code.in.tum.de/git/ias-common.git ias_common
svn co http://code.in.tum.de/pubsvn/knowrob/tags/latest knowrob
but
I can not install system dependencies and build the KnowRob stack with rosdep satisfy knowrob
rosdep: error: Unsupported command satisfy.
What should I do ?
Thank you in advance.

A:

The rosdep arguments have changed, it should be 'rosdep install knowrob' by now.
