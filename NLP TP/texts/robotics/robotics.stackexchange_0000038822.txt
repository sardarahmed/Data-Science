Q:

cmake with rosserial problem

I edited the CMakeLists.txt as directed, and got the (expected) error: -- The arduino sdk path is ARDUINO_SDK_PATH-NOTFOUND
-- Could NOT find Arduino (missing:  ARDUINO_SDK_PATH ARDUINO_SDK_VERSION)
I set the ARDUINO_SDK_PATH to ~/Downloads/arduino-1.0 where the IDE lies using set(ARDUINO_SDK_PATH ~/Downloads/arduino-1.0/).
Now I'm getting: -- Could NOT find Arduino (missing:  ARDUINO_SDK_VERSION)
what do I have to set ARDUINO_SDK_VERSION as??
Thanks a lot.
