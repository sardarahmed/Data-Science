Q:

Need the uav to perform a circle turn

I've got a project that will require my drone to perform a circle turn while the drone is always facing the tangent of the turning curve. Similiar to a car that is performing a frictionless banked turn. 
Just wondering which method should i use to achieve it, the throttle control can be ignored since i already have a pid on height control.
Any suggestions would be appreciated. 

A:

A possible approach would be to construct a virtual potential field, which is tangent to your desired circle and use it for reference (target) orientation (yaw angle).
There is an algorithm for a plane here: Beard, R., & McLain, T. (2012). Small unmanned aircraft: Theory and practice, Ch. 10.2
