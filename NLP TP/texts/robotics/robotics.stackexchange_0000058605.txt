Q:

Something is wrong with installing ROS on my IntelGalileo board?

I wanted to operate the ROS on my IntelGalilo board and followed the tutoria IntelGalile/HydroGalileoInitialInstall. However, it had something wrong when I handled the step of "bitbake image-full".
Pseudo is not present but is required, building this first before the main build
ERROR:  OE-core's config sanity checker detected a potential misconfiguration.
Either fix the cause of this error or at your own risk disable the checker (see sanity.conf).
Following is the list of potential problems / advisories:
Please install the following missing utilities: makeinfo

ERROR: Execution of event handler 'check_sanity_eventhandler' failed
How can I solve this problem. Thanks for any help.
