Q:

How do I run a unit test with different rosparams?

What is the best way to run a ROS unittest on a Python node multiple times using different rosparam parameters?
I know how to set rosparams within the test nodes, but I don't know how to force the node under test to re-read the parameters.
Thanks,
-Jon Stephan

Sure, I'm using rostest.   But I want to run two tests with the rosparams set to two different values.  Most nodes (or at least my nodes) only read parameters on initialization.  Is there a way to tell a node to re-initialize?

Rerun it.  There's no internal state or official starting state you can force it to return to.  If the node writers wish they can make it reread the parameters regularly, but usually it's expected to restart things.
