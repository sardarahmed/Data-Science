All of these pages are not clear? Could you please elaborate what it is that you don't get?

A:

1.ROS is not a simulator.it is robot development frame.you can use any hardware to build a robot,every hardware can be communication through roscore/rosmaster.
2.You can use a min_x86 board ，arm board，raspberry pi.lt is installed ros system,it is a controller.the motors or sensors is accessed to controller,then the robot can be controlled.
I hope it is helpful.
