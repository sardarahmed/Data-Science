Q:

What information an IMU gives to a drone?

An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is an important sensor used in aerial robotics. A typical IMU will contain an accelerometer and a rate gyroscope. Which of the following information does a robot get from an IMU? 

Position
Orientation
Linear velocity
Angular velocity
Linear acceleration
Angular acceleration

I don't think it gets its orientation information from IMU. The last time I took the test, I said that all but the first two are true. I failed.

A:

You already know the answer - because as you say it contains an accelerometer and a rate gyro.
An accelerometer measures linear acceleration, a rate gyro measures angular velocity. These are the only quantities the unit will actually measure.
The other properties - whether positions, velocities or accelerations - have to be calculated by the controller. For example integrating an acceleration gives a velocity, and integrating again gives position.
There's an exception - if the device is being held motionless in any position, then the accelerometer is sensing which direction gravity is acting in, so it can be used directly as an orientation sensor. But that only applies if you know the device is being held motionless...
Answer will be
Linear Acceleration & Angular Velocity only.
