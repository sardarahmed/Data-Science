Q:

Turtlebot teleop fuerte

Is there a way to operate the turtlebot from the keyboard in ROS fuerte?  I had been able to do this without a problem in ROS electric using these instructions: http://ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_teleop/Tutorials/Teleoperation
When I upgraded to fuerte I no longer have a turtlebot_teleop package.

In Fuerte turtlebot_teleop is a part of the stack turtlebot_apps.
