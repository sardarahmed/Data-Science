Q:

RGB-D SLAM (Non-ROS) Error: octomap_server/OctomapServerConfig.h: No such file or directory

System description: Ubuntu 11.10, 64-bit, with ROS Fuerte installed
I followed the directions for the "non-ROS" installation of RGBDSLAM, as indicated here:

ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam#RGB-D_SLAM_for_Non-ROS_Users

The process is smooth until the very end, where I attempt to make the package, using:

rosmake rgbdslam_freiburg

The error occurs during compilation; the terminal output is as follows:

If anyone has insight about what the issue might be, and how it could be resolved, it would be much appreciated.

@Felix-Endres (below): Thanks mate, that was it.

A:

You need to apply the patch in the rgbdslam folder:
roscd rgbdslam
sudo patch /opt/ros/fuerte/stacks/octomap_mapping/octomap_server/manifest.xml <octomap_server_manifest.patch

Not your fault, the fact is missing from the walkthrough you followed, I'll add it.

is there any such patch available for groovy? i'm facing the same problem with groovy
Comment by Felix Endres on 2013-05-13:
If I remember correctly, the patch is actually not required anymore because the octomap_server has been updated. Otherwise, just look into the patch file, it's only one line that adds some definitions. Should work for the respective file in groovy too.
