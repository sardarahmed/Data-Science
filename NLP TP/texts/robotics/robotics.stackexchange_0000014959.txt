Q:

Path of the robot

I have built a simple robot which will move from a source to destination.
I want to record a 2d path which the robot has taken in real time.
Something which is similar to the image I have take.(similar not exactly the same)
Is there any tool or software which will allow me to do this?
If no, is it possible to generate a similar map not in real time, but after the robot has reached its destination.
Like the robot while traversing will send out information like straight,straight, left left, straight, right, straight and so on.
Can this data be saved and a map generated? The map can be as simple as just the path of the robot.
The robot is simple one built using raspberry pi, arduino. It has components like camera, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor etc.

A:

One of the ways to do path tracking is by indoor mapping. In indoor mapping you can use Triangulation method. Basically, this method uses the help of Relative Received Signal Strength (RSSI) from beacons or WiFi. All you require is minimum 3 BLE/WiFi beacons positioned at three different positions in your room and a BLE/WiFi receiver. ESP32 is the best device you can use for this. You can find some details here http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~trein/csc2228/files/report.pdf

You can also use accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to map the positioning. You can find some reference here:
