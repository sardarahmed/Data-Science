Q:

Definition for ROS packages on Debian Squeeze

Hi everybody, I am trying to install ROS on Debian.
I followed the experimental guide for installing ROS Fuerte in Debian. Everything went well except when I have to launch the command:
rosdep install -ay
I receive the output shown below and it fails.
I saw that for gentoo someone solved this problem using a custom 20-default.list. Is there anything like that for Debian Squeeze 6.0.5 ?
Thank you.

A:

Overall I think your problem is that there's quite a few rosdep rules which are not filled in for debian.  How to submit rosdep rules You will also likely run into issues that there may be packages available for ubuntu but not debian which will need to be satisfied from source.
