Q:

Why is fuerte unsupported on natty?

Is it just per choice of the repository maintainers or are there some deeper incompatibilities between natty and fuerte? i.e. libs that ship with natty, etc.
thanks!

Steven Bellens describes it below. Still hate to think that there's no easy upgrade path for the natty etc folks..

A:

See http://ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html for the logic and reasoning behind it. How I interpret it: as fuerte is released just before the next Ubuntu LTS release, only one previous release of Ubuntu is supported (Oneiric), because of expected major jumps in library versions in the Oneiric version.
