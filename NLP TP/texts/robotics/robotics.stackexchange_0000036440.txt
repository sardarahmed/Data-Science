Q:

Launching nao_driver

Hello,
When I type "roslaunch nao_driver nao_driver.launch" to start the nao driver nodes. I am getting the following error:

A:

nao_driver depends on the common_msgs stack, which contains the missing files mentioned in the output. nao_driver also depends on humanoid_msgs and nao_msgs, so make sure that you install these dependencies first.

To verify the packages are correctly found, simply run "roscd actionlib_msgs", "roscd geometry_msgs" and "roscd humanoid_msgs". All should end up in a valid directory in your ROS installation.
