Q:

missing packages when building ros from source

When I try to install and build ROS electric from source, rosdep complains about not being able to find certain packages. These packages are not in the Ubuntu repositories, so where am I supposed to get them?
One such package is yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev.

A:

I didn't have this problem, so you probably omitted an installation step or so. ROS repositories provide yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev, so if you cannot install it with
sudo apt-get install yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev

it means that you probably didn't set up your sources.list properly (read here, depending on your Ubuntu version). Remember to set up your keys and update apt-get's lists afterwards:
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update

Now yaml-cpp0.2.6-dev should be there for you.

I've added it to the wiki page for source based installation. http://www.ros.org/wiki/electric/Installation/Ubuntu/Source

Actually I think this should be mentioned in the Wiki, or is it?

This is true.  Even when doing ROS completely from source, there are a few other packages outside of ROS that the ROS repositories provide.  So even when doing a source install, you have to add the repositories to apt.
