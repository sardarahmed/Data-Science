Q:

How to add a camera on a robot in the stage simulator?

On the web page of stage_ros wiki, I notice several topics including:
odom (nav_msgs/Odometry)
base_scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan)
base_pose_ground_truth (nav_msgs/Odometry)
image (sensor_msgs/Image)
depth (sensor_msgs/Image)
camera_info (sensor_msgs/CameraInfo)
However, when I launch turtlebot_stage. I don't find any depth or camera_info. I want to know that how to add a camera on a robot in the stage simulator. Thank you!

A:

Here is the link to stage documentation http://rtv.github.io/Stage/group__model__camera.html . Usage is pretty simple, just add the snippet to your robot and it should output data on "/depth".
