Q:

How to: Set collision for ray sensor, but not for chassis

Hi,
I would like to define models, which can be sensed by the ray sensor, but can not collide with each other.
A simple example is attached.
Here I want to sense permanently the corner of the red Object, while I am driving through the object.
Now the problem appears, if I set the collision parameter of the red object.
If they are <pose>0 0 0 0 0 0</pose>, the robot can drive through the object, but the ray sensor can not sense it.
On the other hand, if I set the collision to the same values as the visual parameters, the ray sensor can sense to corners, but the robot can not drive through.

How can I set the right parameters, to sense the corners and dirve through an object?
Kind regards,
tik0

A:

Hi,
there is a tag called <collide_without_contact> , set it to true for your collision.
Cheers,
Andrei

You made my day! It works like a charm. In addition, I had to set the model parameter of the red box to true.
