Q:

How to replace binary package with catkin package?

Hi all,
I'd like to reinstall the same package with catkin. The package is already installed using sudo apt-get install.
Can someone tell me how can I replace the existing package with catkin.
I'm using ROS Hydro, and the package that I'd to replace is rosserial.
Thanks in advance.
regards.

Do you really want to install that system-wide for all users or do you just want to overlay the catkin package, so this is used in your workspace instead of the apt-get system package.

I want to remove the old version of rosserial and install newer one using catkin ..

A:

You can give catkin_make an install prefix in the usual cmake way, i.e., catkin_make -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/hydro.
Note that this will be overwritten as soon as you use a system install via apt-get.
