Q:

RTABMAP 2D Occupancy Grid showing color

I am driving on a grey track with a green grass surrounding. I have a kinect plugin which I modified to reflect Intel d435 parameters. How can I have the 2D Occupancy Grid reflect the change in the color? I want to be able to create a map file that colors the grey track as the track we can drive on and the green grass as the part we can't drive on

A:

If Grid/3D is true, the /rtabmap/cloud_map  point cloud will contain colors. You could recreate an occupancy grid by projecting the cloud on the xy plane and set grey points as empty, and green points as obstacles.
