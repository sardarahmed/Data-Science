Q:

Does canopen_chain_node create local node?

Does the canopen_chain_node create a "local" node on the pc with its own object dictionary or does it just manage the nodes on the bus (ex. motors), as  it can be used as a stand-alone ROS node.
I have struggled with understanding the canopen_chain_node and I am realizing that I might have misunderstood what i actually does. I would like for it to create a canopen node on my ROS-pc with its own object dictionary, which i can set up using eds files and read and write using the services get_object and set_object.
But does get_object and set_object just use SDO's to read and write from other nodes on the bus, instead of reading from a local object dictionary?

A:

As pointed out in the wiki:

It manages a CANopen bus with one or more nodes, which are configures with CANopen EDS/DCF files. The ROS node runs a control loop with CANopen SYNC interval (or with an alternative update interval if the SYNC protocol is not used).

The "node" in canopen_chain_node refers to a ROS node, not CANopen node.

I would like for it to create a canopen node on my ROS-pc with its own object dictionary

At the moment ros_canopen only contains the master implementation.
A ROS node that is a CANopen slave node to a CANopen master is an interesting use case.
Please open an issue to describe this feature.
