Q:

Where does $ROS_DISTRO get set?

I followed the directions for creating an empty catkin workspace, only using hydro in place of groovy.
Most of my environment got set sensibly, except for $ROS_DISTRO:
$ env | grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/joq/ros/wet/test/src:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://vision-4.local:11311
ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE=/home/joq/.ros/config/rosconsole.config
ROS_WORKSPACE=/home/joq/ros/wet/test
ROS_TEST_RESULTS_DIR=/home/joq/ros/wet/test/build/test_results
ROS_EMAIL=jack.oquin@gmail.com
ROS_DISTRO=groovy
ROS_HOME=/home/joq/.ros
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros

I don't know what that breaks, but I suspect it's not good.
It's not getting set explicitly in my .bashrc. What should I do to work around this problem?

A:

ROS_DISTRO gets set by roslib:
https://github.com/ros/ros/blob/groovy-devel/core/roslib/env-hooks/10.ros.sh.em#L9
As catkin is ROS agnostic, the responsibility for setting all ROS related environment variables is isolated into environment hooks which live in roslib and are picked up by catkin. Therefore, a workspace without roslib in it will not produce ROS variables.
EDIT:
Sorry, I misread your question, ROS_DISTRO should getting set to hydro, but we have not update that line in the roslib version for hydro.
I opened a ticket about it here:
https://github.com/ros/ros/issues/10
I jumped to conclusions when I saw "empty workspace", my bad.

I figured it was something like that, but could not determine where it is getting set.
