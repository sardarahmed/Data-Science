Q:

What is the current proper procedure to setup a new robotic arm in MoveIt2?

I have good experience with ROS1 and MoveIt and now I am porting all my work into ROS2, Although the porting progress from moveit to moveit2 is now 95%, Unfortunately I figured out that the movit_setup_assistant is not yet available in ROS2 and moveit2. Thus, what is the proper way to setup a new robotic arm for moveit2?
Thanks in advance!

That's very unfortunate, I would recommend you looking at run_move_group to see how to launch the move group node + RViz2 & panda_moveit_config to see how the config files have changed, let me know if I can help you more

Hello, thanks for replying!
So what is the way that you recommend to setup a new robot on moveit2?, use setup assistant in moveit and then modify the config files to match the ros2 and moveit2 requirments? or is there a better/cleaner/faster way to setup a new robot arm on moveit2?
Thank you!

Yes, exactly, this's what I would recommend you to do, we're planning to port moveit setup assistant soon

Aha alright I got your point!
Actually I don't mind to contribute to the porting process. if you want we can get more in touch since I already tried few stuff on the setup assistant source code directly.

That would be great, do you mind opening an issue here https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues about contributing to the port, I'll add you to the weekly moveit2 stand-up so we can coordinate the port togather
