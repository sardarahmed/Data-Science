Q:

Gazebo 1.2.5 gets really slow after spawning some simple models. [fixed]

Hi,
After spawning some simple models (sdf v1.2) (spatula, mug, table) in Gazebo 1.2.5, the program and the computer gets really slow, although the real time factor stays at 1.0.
Gazebo 1.0.2 worked without any problems using the same models (sdf v1.0) with a real time factor greater than 6.0 .
Ideas?
Thanks,
Andrei
UPDATE: I guess it was some hardware issue, because now it started working fine.
