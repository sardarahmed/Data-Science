Q:

How can I get 3D depth points distance?

Hi there!
I'm trying to get the depth points distance from 3D sensor (Action Pro).
I already got message sensor_msgs/Image from topic /camera/depth/image_raw.
and I play with sensor_msgs/Image->data. but I don't know how can i get the distance data about each pixel.
thanks guys.

thank for your kindness.
My coworker find the way to get distance to convert endian.
I'm not sure for the detail but he use topic /camera/depth/image_rect.
