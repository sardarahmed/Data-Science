Q:

map_msgs/GetMapROI

what does ROI mean? Can someone link me to something that points out how this is used? I see it has an OccupancyGrid in it. I'm looking for a little direction. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

A:

My guess would be: Get Map Region Of Interest.
It should be used to get a partial map in the specified coordinates.
