Q:

Recommended simulator for drone project

I am new to ROS and I would appreciate some help. I am currently working on a drone that does not need someone to pilot it and that is able to pick up objects. I would also would appreciate advice in the ROS version that I should pick. I thought about choosing ROS 2 Galactic but I don't know if that affects the simulator that I can choose. I am looking for a simulator that:

has sensors (a camera) to see object to pick up

has a gripper to collect

can potentially be purchased (the drone exists in reality)

I have been looking into V-Rep (Coppelia Slim), Gazebo, and Webots but I canâ€™t seem to find if all the above conditions are fulfilled by any of them. Webots for example seems a very good option but I could not seem to find the option of the gripper. V-Rep seems good as well but it does not have very nice tutorials.
I appreciate any advice that the community can give me.
Thank you in advance.

A:

Webots has everything you need:

It is very easy to add cameras and all sorts of sensors to Webots, there are plenty of examples in the webots_ros2 package.
Here is an example of a Robotiq gripper that you can easily attach to another robot: https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/tree/master/webots_ros2_universal_robot (but you probably need some smaller gripper for the drone)
Here is a DJI Mavic simulation: https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/tree/master/webots_ros2_mavic
