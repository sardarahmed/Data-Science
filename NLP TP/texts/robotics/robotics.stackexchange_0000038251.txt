Q:

Simulated turtlebot dashboard problem

I'm new with ROS and Turtlebot. So I have very basic question. Should turtlebot dashboard work in simulated turtlebot. Because when I run:
rosrun turtlebot_dashboard turtlebot_dashboard

Dashboard opens, but only the middle button under diagnostic is green. Others are gray. Also when I click on the "wrench" under Diagnostic I get info that everything is in Stale. Is this normal in simulated environment?
Thank you for your help!

A:

The dashboard is not relevant for the simulation because we do not full simulate all of the physical hardware. You should not need the dashboard to use the TurtleBot simulator.

Thank you for the tip. May I ask you something about the simulated kinect? Is it possible to get simulated raw image or create Point Cloud in Rviz with simulated Kinect "out of the box"? Because I can only get laser data posted on scan topic, but can't build Point Cloud.
