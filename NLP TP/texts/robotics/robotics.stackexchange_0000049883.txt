Q:

android tutorial pubsub problem

Hi,
I have installed the pubsub android tutorial on an android device and have it connect to an external roscore on ubuntu desktop.
When I run rostopic list on ubuntu desktop, the "chatter" topic is listed. But when I publish data on this topic, the rosTextView on android unchange. However, run rostopic echo /chatter display the data I published.
Would you know how to fix this?
Thanks in advance.

A:

Check that your NodeConfiguration is using a public address and that the master URI is correct. Also check ROS_IP and ROS_MASTER_URI on your desktop machine.
