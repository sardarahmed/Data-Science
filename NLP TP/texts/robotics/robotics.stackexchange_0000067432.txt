Q:

Conditional 

I'd like to control topic remaps using roslaunch command-line arguments (i.e. by setting ROS parameters).
Is there a way to cause a roslaunch XML topic remap to be conditional? I'm looking for behavior like the <group if="$(arg remap)"> tag.
I tried putting a <remap> into a <group>, but this only seems to remap topics for the nodes in that group.

A:

if and unless can be used on any tag, not just group, so you should be able to achieve what you want with something like:
<remap if="$(your_condition)" .. /> 

See also wiki/roslaunch/XML - If and unless attributes:

All tags support if and unless attributes, which include or exclude a tag based on the evaluation of a value [..]

(emphasis mine).
