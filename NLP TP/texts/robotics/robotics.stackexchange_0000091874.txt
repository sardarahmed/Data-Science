Q:

[ROS2] Finding the executable and source code for a node

I am trying to write an AppArmor profile for a ROS2 node, specifically, /cartographer_node, which was included in one of the packages for TurtleBot3 ROS2 (can be installed in this tutorial here).
However, I am having trouble finding the specific file that the node is executed from. In fact, I am also having trouble finding the source code. Is it possible for someone with experience in playing around with TurtleBot3 ROS2 to help me locate the file? Thank you so much.
If not, would someone help me find the executable for any of the demo nodes? I could perhaps work my way from there.
Edit: I found the symbolic link to the executable in ~/<TURTLEBOT3 WORKSPACE>/install/cartographer_ros/lib/cartographer_ros, and from there I found the actual executable in the build folder. However I still couldn't find the source code.

A:

If you know which package the binary is hosted in and the package has been released through the ROS buildfarm, you can use index.ros.org to search for it.
See index.ros.org/p/cartographer_ros for the page showing the Crystal version.
On that page there is a link to the source repository called Checkout URI in the Repository Summary section of the page (right under the Package Summary section on the left of the page).
For cartographer_ros that shows ros2/cartographer_ros.git for me.
Following that link -- and changing to the crystal branch -- leads me to the source code for all nodes in that package here.
