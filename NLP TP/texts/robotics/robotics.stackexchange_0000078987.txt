Q:

libfcl-0.5-dev cant resolve depends

Building moveit from source on a debian jessie install on a hP Xeon Proliant server.
rosdep 
 Unable to locate package libfcl-0.5-dev
 Couldn't find any package by regex 'libfcl-0.5.dev'

my last issue was because my sources.list was messed, up and I did a apt-get update and solve it, if this has any bearing....
Thanks for all the assistance.

Edit:
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo
executing command [sudo -H apt-get install libfcl-0.5-dev]
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree

Indigo Branch
I think the stray period was my fingers....sorry for the confusion..... How do I verify amd64 or i386? If I remember correctly, i386.

Edit: Here is:
$ uname -a
Linux hpdeb 3.16.0-4-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 3.16.39-1 (2016-12-30) i686 GNU/Linux

and:
$ file /sbin/init
/sbin/init: symbolic link to /lib/systemd/systemd

perviosly I was running on a virtual machine and I switched to actual hardware to overcome some of the challenges with moveit and the virtMach.
The system I have available for this is an HP Proliant DL360 Gen 3 with 1 Xeon 2.4GHz processor( which I believe is 2 cores and 2Gb ram only, Ubuntu  16 lts , I could not solve the video issues to this latemodel, so I shifted to Debian. I was not sure of how well this setup would work with Kinetic so I tried to play it safe, down on the earlier versions of code base, I would love to be able to run kinetic and moveit, Just am unaware if my hardware with support it. Since it looks like I have to reinstall everything, please give me your suggestions.
Downloading the AMD64 version of Debian now....
AWE CRAP.......(?)

Which branch of the moveit repository are you trying to build?
Comment by w on 2017-02-16:
Indigo Branch... ROS already installed and is functioning(WOW... AMAZING)
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
I notice there is a dot in the package regex after the 5 (libfcl-0.5.dev), can you copy-paste some more context (ie: more lines of console output) into your question? I'm wondering where that dot is coming from.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
Also: is that output from apt-get or rosdep? I expect rosdep to say something like "can't resolve X etc etc", not "Unable to locate packge ..".
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
Finally; is this an i386 system, or amd64? I see builds for amd64 and arm64 here but not for i386, hence my question.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
Could you please edit your question with updates? There is not enough space in the comment boxes for console command output. Use the edit link/button below your question text for that. Thanks.

What is the output of uname -a and file /sbin/init?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-02-16:
I'm sorry you are having so much trouble getting things to install/work btw. You appear to just choose some very unlucky combinations of hw/sw for your setups. Building pkgs for all combinations of platforms/archs/OS/distributions is just not feasible.

I would first make sure you have a 64bit CPU. Do something like lscpu or cat /proc/cpuinfo and check what the precise model of CPU you have is.

I have had some successes to sustain me along my path. I was able, with your help to get rosserial running on a nextthing chip that is publishing data  to a networked ROSMASTER, So I know it works.... Just hoping to get to the next level with the move it package.
Thank you for your continued support

A:

$ uname -a

Linux hpdeb 3.16.0-4-686-pae #1 SMP Debian 3.16.39-1 (2016-12-30) i686 GNU/Linux

That's a 32bit install of Debian Jessie. Unfortunately, I don't see any 32bit packages for libfcl-0.5-dev on the package repository for Jessie (nor in the shadow repository). That could explain why apt-get can't find it.
That package is built at build.osrfoundation.org/job/fcl0.5-pkg_builder-master-generic, and I don't see an i386 version there either.
Three options:

ask OSRF to build an i386 version for Jessie (but I don't think that is going to happen, seeing as Jessie is only supported on amd64 and arm64)
build libfcl-dev from source: see the Flexible Collision Library (FCL) section of Building Common MoveIt! Dependencies from Source in Catkin
install the amd64 version of Debian Jessie (note that Jessie binaries are only built for ROS Kinetic, but that does include MoveIt (here), so you wouldn't have to build it from sources)

Did you have a specific reason to install 32bit Jessie (hw support fi)?

Edit: if you'd like rosdep to continue installing things that it can find for your platform, add the -r option to the command line. At the end it should print a summary of things it couldn't install.

Edit2:

Architecture:          i686

Seeing as you don't have a 64bit CPU, you could probably install a 32bit Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) and install Indigo on that. Most of the stuff is still being built for it, but expect that to become less over time (newer ROS versions won't be build on the farm for i386 anymore). And just to make sure: MoveIt is being built for 32bit Trusty (here).
