Q:

Oddity in rxplot

Hi..
I try to "rxplot" but the rxplot does not show anything in window..
I have made "rostopic echo /kirim_ke_servo" to see the data

name: ['joint1',
'joint2',
'joint3']
position: [-0.6512382961093546,
-0.19887827975841985, 1.568777172497011]
velocity: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

So, I try to "rxplot /kirim_ke_servo/position" in terminal

rizqa@ubuntu:~$ rxplot
/kirim_ke_servo/position
[/kirim_ke_servo/position] value was
not numeric: (-0.8225104223257155,
-0.07641244134696615, 1.755642665868377)

In terminal appear the data.. but rxplot does not display anything
How fix the problem ?

A:

rxplot can only plot numeric values. The "/kirim_ke_servo/position" argument you are using is an array of numeric values, hence rxplot complains. Off the top of my head,
rxplot /kirim_ke_servo/position[0]

should work. This way, the argument points to the first numeric_value in the array. You can of course also plot multiple values simultaneously as described on the rxplot wiki page. There's also rqt_plot, last time I checked it didn't work with array values like yours though (might have changed now).
