Q:

base_global_planner doesn't update in planner_frequency

environment

OS: ubuntu 14.04 on an x64, with kernel 4.2.0-42-generic
ROS: indigo
package: ros-indigo-navigation:amd64/trusty 1.12.14-0trusty-20180110-202207-0800

config

base_global_planner: "navfn/NavfnROS"
base_local_planner: "base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS"
planner_frequency: 0.5

Problem
When navigation package is upgraded to 1.12.14 from 1.12.13, global planner doesn't update in planner_frequency.
It seems that the package is well-working at 1.12.13 in the same configuration. Is it problem of 1.12.14?

If you feel this is a regression, it might make sense to report it over at the navigation issue tracker.
As you mention 1.12.13 did run as expected, see this comparison for the differences with 1.12.14.

This is a known issue that has been fixed in more recent versions. https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/523
