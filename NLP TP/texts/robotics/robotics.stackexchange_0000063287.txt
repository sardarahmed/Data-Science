Q:

publish odometry code

hi everyone
I have two arduino uno boards and i need to connect my encoders to each of them. I have two encoder and i dont want to use shield for them. I use rosserial stack to connect my laptop to arduino. Now i need a code to publish my odometry over ROS which consists of some transitions for use datas on gmapping package (like velocities). Does anyone know a good code?
Thanks too much :))

A:

You might want to take a look at the differential_drive package.
I haven't used it myself, but it appears to take encoder readings and convert them to odometry and TF messages, and also provides a node to take standard Twist messages and convert them into individual motor commands.
