Q:

ROSRUN can't find EXECUTABLE

Hello, I am using kinetic and I am trying to run a simple publisher and subscriber.
the cmakelists.xml has the following code.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(mastering_ros_demo_pkg)

cmake_policy(SET CMP0046 OLD)

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  actionlib
  actionlib_msgs
  roscpp
  std_msgs
)

include_directories(
 include
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

add_executable(demo_topic_publisher src/demo_topic_publisher.cpp) 
add_executable(demo_topic_subscriber src/demo_topic_subscriber.cpp)

add_dependencies(demo_topic_publisher ${mastering_ros_demo_pkg}_gencfg)
add_dependencies(demo_topic_subscriber ${mastering_ros_demo_pkg}_gencfg)

target_link_libraries(demo_topic_publisher ${catkin_LIBRARIES}) 
target_link_libraries(demo_topic_subscriber ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

after running rosrun i get the following error :
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named demo_topic_publisher below /home/xavier/catkin_ws/src/mastering_ros_demo_pkg

I did source the setup.bash after catkin_make but still the issue was not sovled.
Please help me out here.

A:

If that is really your CMakeLists.txt, it would appear you are missing a call to catkin_package(..).
See wiki/catkin/CMakeLists.txt for an overview of the various parts and why and when they are needed. See wiki/catkin/CMakeLists.txt - catkin_package() specifically.

Please make sure to delete your devel and build folders, rebuild your workspace and then source /home/xavier/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash.

Also: could you update your question text and add the new CMakeLists.txt (do not overwrite your previous one), so it shows where you added catkin_package(..)? Use the edit button/link for that.
