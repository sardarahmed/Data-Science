Q:

How can I set the preserveWorldVelocity flag in Gazebo 9 (hopefully through roslaunch and urdf)?

In order to get rid of unwanted behavior in Gazebo 7, I have installed Gazebo 9 in hopes of setting the preserveWorldVelocity flag.  (Is "flag" the proper term?)  I'm using roslaunch and xacro to start my simulation.  In the robot xacro I have
<gazebo>
  <self_collide>1</self_collide>
</gazebo>

but trying something similar with
<preserveWorldVelocity>1</preserveWorldVelocity>

has no effect.  Can you tell me how to set this flag so that using PositionJointInterface does not mean velocities are repeatedly cleared?

A:

The solution is to install the latest version of gazebo_ros_pkgs from source (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros).  With that package _preserveWorldVelocity is true.
