Q:

Extract time from .bag file

Hi, I am trying to process some bag files and, while I am able to get the timestamp for each message, I am not able to get the actual time the message was received. Is it possible to get it? I am using the python api and I could not find any documentations, any help is really appreciated! Thanks for your help!

A:

You can get that information using the rosbag API. Take a look at the rosbag Cookbook wiki page. The time is in the tuple returned from read_messages().

Does the time refer to when rosbag received the message?
Comment by tfoote on 2014-12-26:
Yes that does refer to the receive time.

Thanks! I did not know that! I should probably delete my answer as it is inaccurate/misleading.

For some reason I was confused but yes the time is the third item in the tuple returned by read_messages(). Thanks for the help!
