Q:

Installation of turtlebot_simulator fails with apt-get

Hello all, I am facing issues to install the turtlebot_simulator stack with the command:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator

I get the following error:
Install these packages without verification? [y/N] Err http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/ trusty/main ros-indigo-amcl amd64 1.12.7-0trusty-20160420-064058-0700

First question: How can I solve this problem?
Second question: How can I install the turtlebot_simulator stack from source? I read tthe related documentation but I was not able to do it from source. Is it possible to someone give a step by step instructions for this?
Suppose I got the source codes with:
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator.git

and now?

A:

It's recommended to always do an apt-get update before trying to install anything. I suspect that new packages have been uploaded since you updated your index. The timestamp on the files it's failing to get are close to a month old suggesting an out of date repo and we just synced new packages yesterday for indigo.
