Q:

what's difference between rosmake & makefile?

If I didn't change any source file and run rosmake twice,
I found that rosmake will also remake again.
In this case it takes 2.66 sec,but in other it may cause longer.
What's happened?
here is the log:
[rosmake-1] Starting >>> robot_setup_tf [ make ]
[rosmake-1] Finished <<< robot_setup_tf [PASS] [ 2.66 seconds ]

A:

Let me see if I understand what you're asking: Why does ROS remake unchanged code when you perform two rosmakes in sequence?
The short answer-- it just does. rosmake acts the same as make, with some extras. It cycles through all your package's dependencies (and the package itself) to check if anything has changed.
'rosmake -s' will only build the package you specify, and not its dependencies. 'rosmake --pre-clean' will clean the specified package and all its dependencies before remaking all of them. 'rosmake -s --pre-clean' will clean and remake only the specified package.
