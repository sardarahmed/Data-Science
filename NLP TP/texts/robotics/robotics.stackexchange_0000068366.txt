A:

ı solved this problem like this:
robot_pose_ekf package need a /odom message. only /imu_data message (UM7) not enough for this package.So you need to publish a/ odom message from another package. ı published /pose2D message with laser_Scan_matcher package and ı transformed it /odom message like that  /pose2D ---> /odom.
and in the end, robot_pose_ekf is active now with /odom and /imu_data messages.
