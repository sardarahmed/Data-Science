Q:

Get list of topics via rosbridge and websocket

I am currently using rosbridge 2.0 to communicate with ROS via websocket. In connection with this I would like to retrieve a list of all topics through my interface. As I can read from the rosbridge website it should be possible to retrieve a list of topics currently running in ROS via a service call, however, I cannot figure out how this should be done since there are no examples. There is a link on the rosbridge website to a pdf with more information, but this link is unfortunately outdated and does not work.

A:

So I can answer this question myself now. I do not know what I was thinking when implementing this, because I already did it successfully for reading topics. I simply forgot to serialize my message as a JSON object. Now that I have done that, I can retrieve all available ROS topics.
For calling the topics and services I also found these two links very useful:
