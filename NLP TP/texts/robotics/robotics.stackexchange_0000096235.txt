Q:

Where are the AVP Scenario definition and parameters?

The Autoware.Auto course lectures have referenced this document https://discourse.ros.org/uploads/short-url/yc1H3yPx3yw0QhH25NZYEAG6Xul.pdf for describing the ODD design process of Autoware.Auto.
On pages 3 and 4 of this document it is described how the ODD is broken down into scenarios and parameters. I don't see such a definition for the AVP ODD anywhere in the Autoware.Auto documentation. Does it exist and if so where?

A:

It doesn't exist. That document has "Draft" stamped on every page because that's what it is: a draft of a proposed process that has not yet been put into practice.

That being said, the ODD Working Group will be formed during the next Technical Steering Committee call so we are beginning to implement this process. The first task for the new ODD WG will be to fully define the AVP ODD.
