Q:

How to launch rxbag or rqt_bag with the --clock option

Hello
I am launching the playback of a bag file using rosbag play.
Because I want to emulate the clock at the time of recording I use the --clock option along with the use_sim_time=true parameter
http://www.ros.org/wiki/Clock
The problem is I want tot use rxbag or rqt_bag instead of rosbag play.
None of those accept a --clock option.
I should I do it? run a clock server independently? How can I do it?
Thanks
Miguel
Update: No one answered my question. If it does not make sense please let me know. Basically, I just want to know how I can emulate the use_sim_time --clock options with rxbag or rqt_Bag.
Thanks
Miguel

I have a question : why would you want not to use rosbag play ? Is there any particular reason, advantages in rxbag or rqt_bag ? (except the graphical interface)

Sorry. Had a problem with the browser. Yes there are many advantages. With rxbag or rqt_bag you can move forward or backward in time, jump to a specific time in the bag, change in real time the playback rate, etc. There are many advantages. Regards Miguel

I see now that the option is available from the help. But it does not work. If i run rqt_bag --clock mybag.bag and do rostopic echo /clock after pressing the play button nothing happens.
