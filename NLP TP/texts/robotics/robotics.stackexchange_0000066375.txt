Q:

Problem when compile rgbdslam

When I compile the rgbdslam in indigo, I meet the problem as below.

Do any body have the same problem with me, how to fix it?

As the wiki says, rgbd slam is for fuerte and rgbdslam v2 is for hydro (stated as beta).

Hey buddy did u find out a solution for that problem?

A:

You could comment out the for loop with "auto detector" and replace with the following block.
 for(size_t i=0;i<detectors.size();++i)
 {
     if(detectors.at(i)->empty()) return true;
 }
 return false;

Let me know if this solution is ok for you.
