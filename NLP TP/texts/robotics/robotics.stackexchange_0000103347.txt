Q:

How to read Roll and Pitch with Turtlebot3?

I am using the Turtlebot3 with ROS2 Foxy and I can't read the Roll and Pitch, just the Yaw. I'm using this launch:
roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
and the result is:

Which is the same result presented at the documentation
I tested, my opencr itself and it really has the gyroscope to read the 3-axis.
So, what I have to do to have access to the Roll and Pitch?

How to read Roll and Pitch

You obtain these from the IMU sensor. The ros driver typically publishes on a topic named something like /imu/data. By reading the raw sensor data, you are getting the values in the IMU frame. You may need to apply a transformation if you want the values in some other frame (like world or map.)

Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for.
Just to clarify for future users, the topic is named /imu
