Q:

Where is there a URDF tutorial?

The link in the urdf page is broken. Is there a new standard for describing robots and sensors? I've created my urdf file, I can parse it, but how do I access all the info?

Hello seanarm,
I used the URDF tutorials found here. As for accessing the info, what kind of robot are you trying to model? Different programs access the URDF, for example with my manipulator robot (2arms) I used the arm navigation tutorials found here. I've had pretty good success with my robot working in the Warehouse Planner and using real robot data feedback. I've also heard of people using Gazebo as a simulation platform, here are the tutorials for that.
Best of luck with your research!
Kind Regards,
Martin
