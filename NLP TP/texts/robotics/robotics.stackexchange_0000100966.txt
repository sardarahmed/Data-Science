Q:

Groot Installation on ROS2 Foxy

Currently, I tried to install groot on linux. When I install it, I faced this problems. Anyone know how to install it using ROS way?
[ 76%] Linking CXX executable Groot
/usr/bin/ld: CMakeFiles/Groot.dir/bt_editor/main.cpp.o: in function `BT::TreeNode::~TreeNode()':
main.cpp:(.text._ZN2BT8TreeNodeD2Ev[_ZN2BT8TreeNodeD5Ev]+0x13): undefined reference to `vtable for BT::TreeNode'

A:

Hello @osilva, I believe what you are referring to is integration of Groot with the Nav2 stack.
You can however install groot on foxy following the documentation here. Just use colcon build --packages-select groot instead of catkin_make
You can then run it with:
./<your-workspace-path>/build/groot/Groot

Once compiled and sourced, Groot can also be run with $ros2 run groot Groot.
