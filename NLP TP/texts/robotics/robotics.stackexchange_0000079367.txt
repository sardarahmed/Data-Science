Q:

How to obtain list of all available topics [python]

In my gazebo model I have 9 differential drive vehicles.
When I execute rostopic list i  get
/bot_0/cmd_vel
/bot_0/odom
/bot_1/cmd_vel
/bot_1/odom
/bot_2/cmd_vel
/bot_2/odom
/bot_3/cmd_vel
/bot_3/odom
/bot_4/cmd_vel
/bot_4/odom
/bot_5/cmd_vel
/bot_5/odom
/bot_6/cmd_vel
/bot_6/odom
/bot_7/cmd_vel
/bot_7/odom
/bot_8/cmd_vel
/bot_8/odom
/clock
/gazebo/link_states
...    and so on

I wish to find out all the odom topics in python script and subscribe to all of them using the message_filter
However, I am not being able to find/locate the getTopics() function as is mentioned here  Kindly let me know what package do I import to get the getTopics() function working.
Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

A:

The getTopics function is C++ only. The equivalent function in Python is get_published_topics.

Note that this only gives topics that are advertised while rostopic list also shows topics that are only subscribed to by some node.
