Q:

Install gazebo ros control with Gazebo 6

I have installed ros indigo on my Ubuntu 14.04 and because I needed some features of Gazebo 6 I installed ros-indigo-gazebo6-ros-pkgs. I need to use gazebo ros control but there is no package ros-indigo-gazebo6-ros-control and if I try to install ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-control I get a message that I need to have Gazebo 2 on my system with ros indigo. How can I solve this?
