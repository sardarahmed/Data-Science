Q:

Compile error: Multiple main functions in using service clients

Hi,
I am implementing different services to get information hold by a database. I run a first simple service/client for the first query and it works. Now I am trying to do a second service/client. But that causes multiple 'main' definition. Isn't possible to hold different service/client with their own 'main' in the same package?
Thanks.

A:

You should only have one main and use both services from there.
If you want parallel execution you need to build two binaries or use threads.
