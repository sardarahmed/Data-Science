Q:

colcon cannot build packages type:ros.catkin

I tried to build a packages type ros.catkin with colcon on Ubuntu22.04,ROS2 Humble.
$ colcon info
path: .
  type: ros.catkin
  name: rrt_exploration
  dependencies:
    build: catkin geometry_msgs message_generation nav_msgs roscpp rospy std_msgs tf visualization_msgs
    run: geometry_msgs message_runtime nav_msgs roscpp rospy std_msgs tf visualization_msgs
  metadata:
    maintainers: ['Hassan Umari <oh91@windowslive.com>']
    version: 1.0.0

but,I get the following error.
    CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcatkin.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "catkin", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "catkin" with any
  of the following names:

    catkinConfig.cmake
    catkin-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "catkin" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "catkin_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "catkin"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

I want colcon to be able to use catkin so I want to build this package. I tried referring to Why qtcreator cannot find catkin packages?[SOLVED], but it doesn't solve the problem. There is no "catkin" folder in /opt/ros/humble.
It was working fine when I did the ROS2 humbleenter link description here and tutorialbot3 tutorials(https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation).
Maybe becauce These packages include packages type:ros.cmake,ros.ament_cmake, but do not include packages type:ros.catkin.

A:

catkin is the build system used in ROS 1 - ament replaces it in ROS 2. The package you are trying to build might have a different git branch, or different repo possibly, that is designed for ROS 2. It is also possible that this package just doesn't have a ROS 2 port (yet).
