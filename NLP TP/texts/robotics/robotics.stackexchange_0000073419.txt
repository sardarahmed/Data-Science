Q:

Pcl Library and Rviz

Hello guys,
I'm new about ROS. I wrote a c++ file usign the pcl library which let me to keep me different pointclouds from the kinect, elaborate them and concatenate them in order to make a 3d reconstruction of the room. I'm able now to see the merging of the pointcloud on the openniVisualizer. Now I would like to do the same, but I would like to publish the point cloud on ROS Visualizer.
Is it possible?
if yes, how can I do this?

A:

If you have PCL pointclouds and you want to publish them so rviz can visualize them, you can do so directly. See: http://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros#Publishing_point_clouds
