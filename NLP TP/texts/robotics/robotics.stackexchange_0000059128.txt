Q:

Turtlebot doesn't stop after killing the command velocity

Hi Everyone,
I am running two turtlebots  (kobuki) with gazebo1.9 and I provided command velocities to each turtlebot using “rostopic pub” command. I noticed that turtlebot keep moving after I killed the command velocity using “Control tab  +c”.
I am wondering if this anomaly is due to the inertia values for my wheels or something else
Thanks for any help with this issue

Have faced similar problems with Roomba

Somebody gave a tip to sent 0 command velocity.
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]'
That command stopped the turtlebot.

A:

I believe that unless a value of zero gets published, then the last value is what is used by the bot.  Killing the publication command doesn't force a value of zero to be published, so the bot continues with the last speed it received.
