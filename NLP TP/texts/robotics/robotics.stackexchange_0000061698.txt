Q:

What is the correct process for adding/editing rosdep keys?

Is there a documented process?
Is the accepted practice to make pull requests with the changes to the rosdep files here:
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/tree/master/rosdep
Thanks in advance for any clarifications/info.

A:

Yes, changes there should reflect the best knowledge of publicly available packages. If you have more packages you'd like to capture please submit pull requests for the updates.

Thanks Tully! Wanted to confirm that that was the correct way to do things before opening up pulls willy-nilly.
