Q:

org.ros.rosjava Jar Messages files Do Not update

Hi all,
My message jar files at at /.ros/rosjava/lib/org.ros.rosjava.my_msgs-0.0.0.jar. I have the problem that when I change the message (add one more field) and rosmake the message. It is compiled but the jar files are not updated. I even removed the org.ros.rosjava.my_msgs-0.0.0.jar from /.ros/rosjava/lib/ even then it does not generate new jar file for my_msgs.
Did anyone have the same problem, how can I fix it??
Regards

A:

This is a known issue. See http://code.google.com/p/rosjava/issues/detail?id=62
As a workaround, the easiest (although time consuming) thing to do is rm -rf ~/.ros/rosjava and then rebuild. It is also possible to selectively remove everything from ~/.ros/rosjava (i.e. use grep and find) that has to do with you package and then rebuild which is faster.
