Q:

What are good Kinect gmapping parameters?

I noticed in the gmapping documentation, it says "This version is optimized for long-range laser scanners ... short range lasers ... will not work that well with the standard parameter settings.".
I was wondering what parameters people have been successfully using for Kinect-based navigation?   (My results so far have been less than perfect)
Thanks,

Here is what the map looks like.  My method was: drive into an empty space, and rotate in a circle, then move on to a new space:

--- Edit ---
Here's what the map looks like when I make sure to always have a corner in the field of view when moving to a new part of the map.  It's much, much better:

Actually I think if you are doing indoors stuff the short range of the kinect isn't really that much of a problem in comparison to the very limited field of view (55 deg vs. 180-270 deg of common lasers).

Ok, that makes sense.   It seems to do a good job building a map when it sees two walls in the same field of view, but not when it has to rotate from one wall to the other.

Yep, tried again making sure I always had a corner in view, and it does much better.  Unfortunately, I think that means it probably won't be able to autonomously build a map, without some heavy-duty programming.

It would really help if I could save the map half-way through and use that as the initial map when restarting because it takes so long to map the house and it often screws up half-way through.  I think I'll open a new question.

@domhege, if you post the answer "Use the default parameters, and make sure you always have a corner in the field of view", I'll mark that as the correct answer.

By the way - I just upgraded the laptop on my robot (from a single core pentium to a dual core core i3), and it seems to do the mapping much better.  I can be a little more careless about my driving and still get a pretty good map.

A:

If you can manage to always see at least one corner it should be way better. Aligning on one wall only is quite bad.

Yes, the default parameters work fine when keeping one corner in the field of view.
