Q:

Comparison of lifting systems

What kind of systems can be used to make a torso lifting system like the one used by this robot (the black part) :

Rack and pinion
lead screw
scissor lift
can a triple tree help ? 

What are the pro and cons of each system ?
How do they ensure stability ?
And finally, is there a way to draw current when lowering instead of drawing current when lifting ?

A:

So this is summary...Open to discussions or edits...
| Mechanism          | Precision | Friction | Max length | Max force |
|--------------------| ----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| rack and pinion    | low       | high     | unlimited  | high      |
| lead screw         | high      | mid      | limited    | high      |
| ball screw         | high      | low      | limited    | high      |
| scissor lift       | mid       | low      | limited    | high      |
| linear direct drive| high      | low      | unlimited  | mid       |
| 4-bar mechanism    | high      | low      | limited    | high      |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|

It may worth noting:

that the scissor and 4-bar mechanisms have a non-linear dependency between input and output velocity
not all 4 bar mechanism's motions are linear
the scissor mechanism (if designed like this) provides a good lateral stiffness, all others would need some form of linear motion guide to cope with lateral forces that bend the structure. 

You can use a spring (mech/pneu/hydro) to invert the direction of effort, or a simple counterweight.
You may want to use a non-backdrivable gearbox to drive these (not the linear direct drive of course)...
