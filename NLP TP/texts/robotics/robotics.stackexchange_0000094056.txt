Q:

Where can I find generated C++ files for .msg?

Is it possible to find generated source code for messages?
I'm building a (mobile) client that needs to communicate with the server using custom messages. I can see .msg files for them in the server codebase, but can't find source files that I can easily import into the client codebase.

A:

gencpp generates C++ headers for each .msg that you ask it to process.
Those you can find in the include/$pkgname directory of the devel space of a workspace.
For packages that you've installed using apt, you can find them in /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/include/$pkgname.
