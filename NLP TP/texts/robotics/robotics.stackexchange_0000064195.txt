Q:

The images from Bumblebee 2 is noisy

Hi,
I capture an image from Bumblebee 2 (mono8 from mono 16 raw data).
It looks like that: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54750216/left.jpg
It looks very noisy. Are they supposed to noisy like that ? Or have to adjust some parameters?
Thanks.

I haven't used the bumblebee before, but that looks sort of like a raw bayer-pattern image. Have you tried passing it through a debayering node/nodelet?

I tried to do debayering. But it returns error. My understanding is that mono image does not need to do debayer? Am I right?
I do err = dc1394_deinterlace_stereo_frames(frame, &decodeFrame, DC1394_STEREO_METHOD_INTERLACED);
it returns success.

I'm not familiar with the API you're referring to. You may want to consult the manufacturer's docs or wait for someone more knowledgeable to come along.

Also... is this actually related to ROS?

A:

@ahendrix is right, the first image is a bayer pattern, and the other image posted looks as if the data stream was not correctly gathered or that different color channels are shown in grayscale.
We implemented a driver for a Bumblebee 2 camera some time ago. We are still using and maintaing it. I recommend you that you run it and see what happens. The node is available at http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera1394stereo .
Run the stereo_camera.launch together with an stereo_image_proc node and subscribe with an image_viewer. If the problem persists I would contact PointGrey support.
