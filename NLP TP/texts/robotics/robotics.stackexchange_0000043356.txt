Q:

Unused Repository Directories in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH from using rosws

I have a small issue with my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable.
I am going through the ROS Beginner tutorials, and I notice that I have some extra directories on my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH that don't actually exist.
The problem arose when I was doing step 3 of the overlays tutorial.  I specified the wrong parameters in my rosws set command.  It still added the local directory to my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, but the local repository/directory does not exist.
In other words, this is my ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:
/home/developer/fuerte_workspace/clearpath_common:/home/developer/fuerte_workspace/husky:/home/developer/fuerte_workspace/clearpath:/home/developer/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
The entries that end in "clearpath" and "husky" were erroneous attempts and do not exist locally.  Is there some sort of "rosws unset" command or some other way that I can clean-up my path?
Thank you for reading.

A:

use rosws remove.
Or you can always remove entries from your .rosinstall file manually.
