Q:

where can i learn electronics from intro to advance digital

I'd like some well put video series of like 30 videos. Or anything but it needs to thorough and in easy English...less mundane. So far all resources i have found either go upto resistors code or of projects that tell you do this and this and this and tada you got this.
Is there really no online resource for people to learn electronics. I want further master analog and do move on to digital cause it's better to spend 0.40 cents.... than
 spend $95 on components and get the whole thing on tiny chip.
Please bare with me like six months i have been searching for legit source, material that is meant to teach you. I like pictures and colors.
