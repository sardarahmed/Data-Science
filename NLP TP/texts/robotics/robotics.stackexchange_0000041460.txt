Q:

Equivalent of --rosdep-install in Fuerte

Hey there. Quick question.
I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 with ROS Fuerte. Is there any download/install command which recognizes the nested dependencies in a repository/download source that can automatically download those as well? I sincerely don't desire to download all nested dependencies individually.
I tried using rosmake --rosdep-install but met failure.

For example, if I want to install the stack "object_recognition", which has many dependencies, how exactly would I do that conveniently?

rosdep install your_package_name

A:

Just call rosdep before you call rosmake with the same arguments.  We removed the ability to automatically call through for cleaner dependency trees and clearer purpose.
