Q:

PCL library version in ROS

Hi, I'm wondering what the version of PCL library in my ROS is.
For example, currently PCL is 1.5.1 updated on 2012.02.22, then what is it for my
PCL? And where can I check out these version information?
Also, how can I update my PCL in ROS when the standalone PCL library is updated?
Thanks for answering.
