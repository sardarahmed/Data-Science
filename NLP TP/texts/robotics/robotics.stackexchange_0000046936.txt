Q:

sensor_msgs/CompressedImage decompression

Hi all!
I cannot use this type of data: sensor_msgs/CompressedImage. I've trasformed the originale image stream with the "image_transport" package, to send image over internet. Now i need to trasform this compressed image in a usable image (a sensor_msgs/Image or somethink like).
Any suggestions??
Thanks a lot!

Are you attempting to decompress the raw bytes outside of ROS or simply to subscribe to a compressed image stream using ROS on a remote machine?

I need to use image stream in ros. I hope to transform compressImage data in a CvMat :D or any opencv data format.

A:

SOLVED:
With instruction:
cv::Mat matrix = cv::imdecode(cv::Mat(buffer_image_compressed),1)
it's possibile to use the compressed image in opencv!
