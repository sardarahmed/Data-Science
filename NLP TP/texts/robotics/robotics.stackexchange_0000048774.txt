Q:

ROS moveit programmatically adding collision object

Hi,
I would like to add Collision objects to the planning scene, similar to how it was previously possible in Electric+arm_navigation (see code ).

You can do this in two ways: either you publish a CollisionObject message on the /collision_object topic, or, you can call
processCollisionObjectMsg() function directly on the PlanningScene, if you are in the same process.
Furthermore, you can do something like:
planning_scene->getWorld()->addToObject("object_name", Shape, Pose);

I would like to add a cylinder (shape primitive) as collision object, but I am struggling to write a cpp file similar to the tutorial 'Adding known objects to the collision environment'. As far as I know, such an example does not exist for MoveIt, or do I miss somethi
