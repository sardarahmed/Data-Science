Q:

Any one can create a bag file for me?

Hello,
To work on my thesis I need a bag file from a PR2 (or similar differential wheeled robot) sensors, and follows a simple closed path, like a square or a triangle.
Topic that I need are:
/camera/rgb/image_rect 
/camera/rgb/camera_info 
/camera/depth_registered/image_rect 
/camera/depth_registered/camera_info 
/odom 
/imu 
/tf 
/scan

Can anyone do me this favor and prepare such bag file?
One more thing, there most be walls or something around the path to create a map with using gmapping.

Have you tried KITTI dataset?http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/ http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/

A:

There are a number of differential drive robots with lasers available here: http://fergy.me/slam/ although the robots typically drove quite a long way. For some of the bag files, there are also ground truth maps in the form of .pgm files.
EDIT: just noticed this in another question I answered: MIT has also posted bagfiles acquired on a PR2: http://projects.csail.mit.edu/stata/d... These include a lot more than just laser data.

It seems none of them have camera related topics, they are quite small files to have video data.

Yes that is right -- I missed the list of topics you were looking for, and honed in on the "gmapping" and map building part. Sorry for the noise.

Finally I had to use MIT dataset.
