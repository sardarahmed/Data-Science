Q:

lookupTransform now not erroring as expected in tf python tutorial

Working through the Python version of the tf tutorial on page using Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
For the first example on page: http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/tf%20and%20Time%20%28Python%29 an error is expected when asking for a lookupTransform with time set to rospy.Time.now().
The "chaser" turtle does not move, but no errors are reported. Can anyone else verify this? Perhaps the error is suppressed in newer versions of ROS?
Worked through the rest of the page and everything is working as expected.

A:

Found it. In a previous step, we wrapped the lookupTransform call with
        except (tf.LookupException, tf.ConnectivityException, tf.ExtrapolationException):

Removing tf.ExtrapolationException for the list of handled exceptions allows the error to be reported.
