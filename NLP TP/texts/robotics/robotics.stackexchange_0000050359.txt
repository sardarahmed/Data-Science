Q:

Is there a simple script to crop an occupancy map?

Many mapping approaches generate huge maps with a lot of free space around it, which slows down move_base, etc.
Is there already some script that does the cropping automatically including updating the origin correctly?
There already is a related ticket for the map server to do this.
