Q:

Move Base Publishing Y velocities

Hi,
I've run into this strange behavior while trying to get my robot stack to run in gazebo. I've configured a turtlebot URDF with some 3D sensors and launching my pretty-generic ROS navigation stack configs. All of the sudden, move base is publishing only Y and theta velocities, no X.
I figure it must have to do with the URDF configs I changed or TF from the diff drive gazebo plugins, because I have not changed move_base in this development effort.
Any thoughts? I've become stumped here.

To get the syntax highlighting working just copy and paste your code/terminal output into your question, highlight it, then click the preformatted text (101010) button.

Edit: Lies, it still happens. Something TF related?
Figured it out .
For the next weary soul: Turns out, for the diff drive controller, if you set it to base_footprint, it'll do some weird conversion or interpolation (?) and give you both X and Y components of a non-holonomic robot base.

But that's not it! Also generally speaking, gazebo is not a happy camper with footprint transforms. Base Link made everyone happy which I'm a little confused by but I suspect TF isn't publishing this fast enough and gazebo has some assumptions in how you set it up.
