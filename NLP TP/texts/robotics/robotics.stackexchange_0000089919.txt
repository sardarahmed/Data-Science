Q:

Package installation confusion

I am missing something obvious, maybe you can help. I have a ROS install on my laptop that I have used with both turtlebot and turtlebot3. I am having a problem which I might have traced to diagnostic_agg. What is happening is that the msg that is published has a value at msg.status[7].values[1].value which I expected to see at status[7].
And given that these two robots are similar but not identical I started thinking that the fact that I have both turtlebot3 and turtlebot on the same computer may be the problem. So I double check my directories and I am not sure now whether turtlebot package is actually there. Here's what I did:
$ ls ~/catkin_make/src
CMakeLists.txt  cr_ros  cr_web  rosbook  turtlebot3  turtlebot3_msgs  turtlebot3_simulations

$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot
 sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot

Here's the relvant part of my .bashrc
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

#export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://roscore1.cs.brandeis.edu:11311
#export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://129.64.147.94:11311
#export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
#export TB3_MODEL=burger
# export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://`myip`:11311

source ~/mydev/rosutils/.rosbash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://129.64.243.64:11311
export ROS_IP=`myip`

Solved
But unfortunately I don't have a clear idea of how I solved it. I went through the usual 'hygiene' steps of updating packages, running make again, rebooting both the robot and the laptop, and the problem went away. But I am quite sure the problem was there as I described it, I just don't have a hypoothesis of what was going wrong.

So what do you get when you run env | grep ROS and env | grep PATH ?

I'm confused @pitosalas: did you unmark my answer as the answer? Any particular reason?
Comment by pitosalas on 2018-12-22:
Sorry @gvdhoorn you've been very helpful always. I had a dilemma, both the answers helped me solve the problem. I just clicked the one that was more comprehensive and which referred to yours also. In reality I am not sure how I fixed the problem.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-12-22:
No need to apologise. I was just curious.

A:

It's unlikely that having both the turtlebot and turtlebot3 packages installed on your system will cause interference.
It looks like the turtlebot is not in your workspace or on your path if rospack cannot find it. Have you sourced the kinetic setup.bash? Please edit your post to share what you're doing to setup your bash terminal including showing relevant parts of your .bashrc if there are ROS releated settings in there.
@gvdhoorn is right that the metapackage isn't expected to be found.
