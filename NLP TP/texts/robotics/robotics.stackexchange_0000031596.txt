Q:

how do I publish a new ros node or package?

I've written a small ROS package and uploaded the source to a repository on github.
It's a package to provide some interfaces between ROS and the SIG EVO car racing championship simulation.
I thought I would then be able to then publish my package so that it would show up on http://www.ros.org/browse/list.php somewhere.
I had a look on ros.org for how to do this, but can't see it.  Am I on the right track?  Or should I add my node to an approved repository?

A:

If you have a new package which you would like to announce and get indexed please email the ros-users mailing list to announce it and we will add it to our documentation indexer.
