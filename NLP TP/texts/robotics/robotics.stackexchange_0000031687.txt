Q:

How to run "larks" package

Hello,
I am doing my master thesis on implementation of object detection techniques on GPU. For that I need to implement a method called lark. I found that code as a package "larks" in "object_recognition_experimental" stack. But i didn't understand how to run that package. I tried through various steps but i couldn't. And while i am trying to install dependencies using "rosdep install larks" i am getting an error
Failed to find rosdep libsoci for package larks on OS:ubuntu version:10.10 
ERROR: ABORTING: Rosdeps [u'libsoci'] could not be resolved

Could you please help me.
Thanks & Regards,

A:

It looks like the rosdep.yaml file for the object_recognition stack doesn't include a line for Ubuntu 10.10. A ticket should be filed against object_recognition here  but until that gets fixed one workaround is to edit the rosdep.yaml file in the object_recognition stack root and duplicate the line which starts with 10.04, changing the 10.04 to 10.10.
When I did this and reran rosmake in the rein package I got an error about soci.h still not being found, but I fixed this by running make clean in the rein package folder and then rerunning rosmake. At that point I could successfully run rosmake larks.
