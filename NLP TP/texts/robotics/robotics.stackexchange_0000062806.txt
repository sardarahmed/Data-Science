Q:

why to define ros::spin() in another thread?

Hey all,
There is an example in actionlib tutorial: wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/SimpleActionClient(Threaded). In this example the ros::spin() command is used in another thread.
Why should I create a ros::spin() command in a new thread? Why shouldn't I use this command in the end of the main like  I see in the most of examples? What's the difference between these two cases?
Thanks in advance.

A:

This is to show how you can integrate the client into a larger system. In contrast to the first example client which takes over your only thread. http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/SimpleActionClient
