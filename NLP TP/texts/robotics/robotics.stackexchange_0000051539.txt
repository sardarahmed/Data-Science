Q:

ROS Wiki Citation

Hello,
What would be the correct way to cite to ROS-wiki? In a bibtex entry who should the author be, since it a community wiki?
Regards

A:

You can use @misc without an author http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3587/how-can-i-use-bibtex-to-cite-a-web-page
Wikipedia has some good recommendations too

As in Stage, recommendation is to cite this paper 'Richard Vaughan. "Massively Multiple Robot Simulations in Stage", Swarm Intelligence 2(2-4):189-208, 2008. Springer.', Could be cited this paper (http://www.willowgarage.com/papers/ros-open-source-robot-operating-system) in the case of ROS?
