Q:

boost:exception_detail::clone_impl

I am trying to get my create 2 up and running using an Autonomy Lab driver.  I am using Indigo 14.04  on an Intel UP board.  I get the following error:
NODES

A:

It sounds like your Create 2 is not appearing as the default device name /dev/ttyUSB0. Power on the Create, connect the serial cable, and check to see that the device is correct. You can do this by running ls /dev before and after connecting the Create and identifying the new device that appear in the list. Then, try modifying the value of the parameter dev in the file create_2.launch to match the listed device.

After I asked the question, I went back and wiped my drive and reinstalled Indigo 14.04, ROS, and the Autonomy Lab driver. I was then able to connect to my Create 2. Apparently, I did something during the previous install that confused the operating system. Thank you for your response
