Q:

Assign C++ Array to ROS Msg Array

How do I assign a C++ array to a ROS message array? In particular, how do I do this for a float64[9] array?

A:

The std_msgs/Float64MultiArray message should do what you want:
http://docs.ros.org/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Float64MultiArray.html
The message structure has a single field called data which can be treated as a std::vector<double> type in your C++ node.  If you know it will be a fixed array of 9 values, just allocate 9 elements in the vector after declaring the message variable:
std_msgs::Float64MultiArray array_msg;
array_msg.data.resize(9);

You can then publish and subscribe to a topic to transmit array messages between your nodes.
I hope this helps!
