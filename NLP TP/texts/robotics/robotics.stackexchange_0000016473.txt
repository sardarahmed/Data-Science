Q:

Benfit of behaviors & benefit of hybrid systems

I have two questions that I think are closely related:

Why is it useful to introduce behaviors, e.g., goal-to-goal + obstacle avoidance? (The alternative would have been to just use a single behavior with the more complex cost function that rewards getting to the goal without hitting stuff)?
Why is it useful to analyze hybrid systems (instead of purely continuous systems that approximate switches and resets as continuous phenomena)?

I think know a naive answer: this makes system design & analysis more tractable, by splitting a very complex problem into smaller pieces that can be, to some extent, studied separately. But is there a more in-depth intuition behind these choices?

A:

The answer you have found out yourself is not naive but rather at the core of science and technology. In fact, when we are not good at tackling the problem as a whole, because it is way difficult or even intractable for us, or when we do not want to put too much effort into dealing with lots of details we are not interested in (think of your example of approximating continuous phenomena with discrete events), then we split it into pieces we are able to better manipulate, in the hope (sometimes we can get stronger guarantees though) that this new arrangement will help us solve the original problem. 
A secondary reason underlying this methodology is to implement the composition of tools, which makes our lives much easier because allows us to reuse components that have been designed and realized for problems different from the one at hand. Therefore, by breaking down (analysis) a big goal into a list of smaller ingredients that can be combined together, we will be able later on to aggregate (synthesis) those units to solve other quests, maybe only loosely related to our starting point.
