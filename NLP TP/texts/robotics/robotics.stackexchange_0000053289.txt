Q:

[ERROR] fatal: cannot exec 'fetch-pack': Argument list too long

Hi everybody, I'm a ROS newbie and I'm trying to build it since a few days ago.
First I tried in a VM with CrunchBang #! but it had a lot of errors.
Now I'm trying in my native OS (Snow Leopard), and I'm having a bunch of errors trying to build even the bare bones distribution.
fatal: cannot exec 'fetch-pack': Argument list too long
I understand that's an error of git, but I mean I'm having 3 pages of errors so I can't build ROS as it should be.
Hope somebody can help me a bit to find a solution.
Thanks in advance!

A:

I have struck upon a workaround. The error you are experiencing occurs because of the way that Git handles smart HTTP (read http://code.google.com/r/renyanemma-gitcore/source/detail?r=078b895fefdca94995862a4cc8644198b00a89bf for a good explanation).
This issue exists only when Git uses Smart HTTP, which is the default choice that rosinstall_generator makes for you when it generates a .rosinstall file. By changing:
uri: https://github.com/ros-gbp/ros_comm-release.git
                                        to

uri: git@github.com:ros-gbp/ros_comm-release.git
for each affected item in your .rosinstall file, Git will use SSH to clone the source repositories instead, which apparently does not create problems for your terminal's argument buffer.
Simply replace-all https://github.com/ to git@github.com: in your favorite text editor (sed included), and you should be all set.
