Q:

3rd party package installation on Groovy

I was trying to install a joystick package in my ROS Groovy system.
I followed the tutorial I found in ROS wiki (www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/StackInstallation) but it seems to be a bit outdated, because at a certain moment (after the git cloning of the project in /opt/ros/groovy/share directory) it says to do a "rosmake --rosdep-install", something that gives me an error: rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install
I believe I have to install the package using catkin but I am getting errors too: The specified base path "/opt/ros/groovy/share/joystick_drivers/joy" contains a CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must be invoked in the root of workspace
I wonder if I have to create another workspace since I already have the one I created for the beginner_tutorials?
Regards

A:

I solved the problem by instaling the package using apt-get: sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-joystick-drivers
But nevertheless I would like to know how to compile/install the package from the source code I got from the git repository.
