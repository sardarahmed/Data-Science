Q:

Conditional block for params on macro xacro

I was wondering how can i use if condition in params on macro?
for example:
<xacro:macro name="leg" params="prefix suffix">

I want to use if condition about the suffix:
if suffix == left so create "A", but if suffix != left so create "A"

or the concept is like if-else condition in a programming language?
The documentation on ros wiki doesn’t explain that.

A:

Oh it solved, i added <xacro:property name="suffix" value="left"/> when i call the macro. it give the property name suffix to the value “kanan”, so i can execute the conditional block using <xacro:if value="${suffix == 'left'}">

<xacro:if value="${suffix == 'left'}">

</xacro:if>
<xacro:unless value="${suffix == 'left'}">
