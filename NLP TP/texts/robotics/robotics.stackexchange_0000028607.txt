Q:

Edit link and joint names in the editor

Hello list,
Is it possible to initial set joint and link names or edit them afterwards in the editor?
Or should that be done in the sdf-file directly?
I want to create a complex robot in the editor and than later convert it into a urdf to use it from ROS.
During this development I would like more meaningful names for the links and joints.
Thanks in advance,
Sietse Achterop

A:

You can edit the joint name in the 'joint inspector' after you right click on the selected part. You can't rename the links, though.

Thanks. It is a pity that there seems no work ongoing in better integrating urdf and sdf.
