A:

unknown error handler name 'rosmsg'

This was a bug in genpy; it is fixed in 0.6.13.
Try upgrading:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

Error opening serial: [Errno 13] could
not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: [Errno 13]
Permission denied: '/dev/ttyUSB0'

Try adding yourself to the dialout group:
sudo adduser `whoami` dialout

and reboot (or reload permissions).

It seems that the same problem occurs in 0.6.15, downgrading genpy built from source to 0.6.14 helps.

@Maxim Rovbo: have you reported this?
A comment on ROS Answers has very limited visibility.

I just ran into the problem and even just using the latest genpy source (git clone into my workspace) worked. It was commit acf8eb7e8cd464af6650619961d8ff3c4f4a6ac8 which should be 0.6.15 as far as I understand .. so maybe the root cause is something else? Anyway Im happy with the fix for now.

Reporting issues is typically more to help others, not so much for yourself.
And work-arounds are not scalable.

Added an issue

Might also have to blow out the build and devel folders and rebuild the workspace.
