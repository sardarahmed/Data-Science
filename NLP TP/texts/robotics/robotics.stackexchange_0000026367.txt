Q:

Plugin/SDF problem; unable to find or open sdf file

Hello, I am trying to create my first Gazebo plugin. I tried to follow this tutorial - link, and this is the result (Gazebo was installed as pre-compiled binaries on Ubuntu 12.04.):
Gazebo multi-robot simulator, version 1.6.1

Error [parser.cc:69] Unable to find or open SDF file[]
