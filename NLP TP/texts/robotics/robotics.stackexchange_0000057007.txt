Q:

rosrun can't find gazebo executable

I just installed gazebo. Everything went fine but when I went to test it using the commands
roscore &
rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo
I got the error
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named gazebo below 
/opt/ros/hydro/share/gazebo_ros
It's strange because tab completion still works and everything appears to be in the correct directories.
Thank you for any help

A:

Did you build the package? And did you source source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash?
Is there a executable in the bin directory of gazebo_ros?

It fixed itself when I restarted my computer. Thank you though!
