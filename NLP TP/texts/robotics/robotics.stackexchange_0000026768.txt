Q:

Simulating Human Models for use with turtlebot tracking

Hey,
How would I go about simulating a human model in gazebo such that I can track legs with the turtlebot follower package. I have the turtlebot simulated in gazebo using the turtlebot_simulator package.
I'm Currently using version 1.9.1 of gazebo.
I'm also running ros hydro if that helps.

Hi,
there once was an actor implementation for this kind of things (v1.0 which is really outdated).
The actor is not really simulated but can be used to play animations.
This was not maintained in the last releases and does not work at the moment.
I'm not sure if someone is really working one this feature right now.
you might want to read this post:

if you really need the animation you can help re-implementing/debugging this feature
The only way to control an actor was to define everything before starting in a script. You can look at the old tutorial for information how it worked:
