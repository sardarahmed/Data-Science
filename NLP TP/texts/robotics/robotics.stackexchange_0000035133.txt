Q:

Turtlebot with not the same model irobot

I have two turtlebots which are of the 4XXX series. I need to define the port number and the baud rate. But, I do not know how to do this. The turtlebots are built around the 5XX and the i-create.  Any advice would be nice, please.
Thank You in Advance.
:-)

A:

if you look in the code you will see a call for setting the baud rate in turtlebot_driver.py... create the SCI interface with the desired baud (something like self.sci= SerialCommandInterface(tty, YOURBAUD)) which basically calls serial with the baudrate
if you would like to change the baudrate and port at a higher level change the turtlebot launch file to use the desire port and baud rate. both parameters are exposed at the node level in turtlebot_node.py
