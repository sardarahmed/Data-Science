Q:

Roomba 400 navigation stack setup

Hello!
I'm using create_autonomy driver for my roomba 400 on kinetic, and I want to set up the navigation stack (especially move_base to send goals to the robot and navigate in rviz). The ca_driver running on Raspberry, the gmapping, map server on the PC.
I'm following the navigation stack tutorial, and as described in it, first, I need to create a package with the following dependencies:
catkin_create_pkg my_robot_name_2dnav move_base my_tf_configuration_dep my_odom_configuration_dep my_sensor_configuration_dep

How should I need to fill up the dependencies on which device (RPI or PC) once the ca_driver itself publish a /tf and a /odom topic when I starting it with the following launch:
roslaunch ca_driver roomba_400.launch

Maybe if anyone successfully deployed the navigation stack, can send me a sample/example launch file or project?

Hello!
Did you solve this problem? I'm stuck here and the tutorial for the turtlebot didn't mention it.

A:

As mentioned in a previous post, you can check out turtlebot_navigation for example launch and config files.

so do I need my_sensor_configuration_dep if I am using urg_node? also doesn't the create_autonomy provide tf and odom so that dependency would be move_base urg_node and create_autonomy?
