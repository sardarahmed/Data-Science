A:

Are you sure you have rqt_graph installed? It doesn't look like it. Did you try installing it using (for indigo) sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rqt-graph or for kinetic sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt-graph?

Do you have your sources setup correctly? Perhaps sudo apt-get update will do the trick if you have, otherwise, look at the instructions from the indigo installation guide to find out how to configure your repositories and setup sources and keys.
