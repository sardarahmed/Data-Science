Q:

Compile locally and install on remote ros install?

Hi Guys.
I have a robot running ROS indigo locally on an ARM hf based  Odroid U3.
Would i in any way be able to compile my custom ros packages locally on my laptop and install them to my odroid, through eg. a python script i write myself?
All in order to avoid installing a lot of extra linux packages and keeping the robot in sync with a git repository to compile.
I hope my question makes sense?
Sincerely Mathias
