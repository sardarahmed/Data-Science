Q:

Compensating for Yaw in Lateral Quadcopter Movement

I'm trying to make a quadcopter move laterally at a certain angle. I've been able to find the proper roll and pitch angles for this (that work with a yaw of 0Â°); how would I adjust these values to compensate for a different yaw?

A:

This is just basic trigonometry; you'll covert your world-relative calculations of roll and pitch ($\phi$ and $\theta$) into vehicle-relative values, based on yaw ($\psi$).
Just so we're on the same page, I'm assuming measurements like the following, with roll, pitch, and yaw being zero when levelly flying North:

$$\phi_{vehicle} = \phi_{world}\cos(\psi) - \theta_{world}\sin(\psi)$$
$$\theta_{vehicle} = \phi_{world}\sin(\psi) + \theta_{world}\cos(\psi)$$
