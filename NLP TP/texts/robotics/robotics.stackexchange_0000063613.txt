Q:

Eigen not found

I was trying to install industrial_calibration (Indigo branch) but I keep getting the following error:

Could not find a package
configuration file provided by "Eigen"
with any of   the following names:
EigenConfig.cmake
eigen-config.cmake

I can fix it by changing Eigen to Eigen3 in CMakefiles.txt but then I get a lot of errors during the build.

A:

The CMakeLists.txt (and package manifest) are missing a dependency declaration on the cmake_modules package. In Hydro, catkin itself provided the required config files, but in Indigo they have moved, resulting in the error you see. See also indigo/Migration - cmake_modules on the ROS wiki.
To get things working quickly:

Update the find_package(catkin ..) invocation and append cmake_modules to the end.
Also add a build_depend on cmake_modules to the package.xml file.

Edit: reported the issue, see industrial_calibration/issues/31.

Edit2: PR 38 is meant to fix these issues (missing cmake_modules and the yaml-cpp incompatibilities).

You already reported the same issue in July, see #31

Seems you're right. Probably a bit too early still for me :). It has become a bit more urgent now though.

And what about the yaml-cpp problem? it still doesn't compile because of that on 14.04
