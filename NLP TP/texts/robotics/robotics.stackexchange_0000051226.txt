Q:

Cannot use ps3joy with turtlesim (can't locate node [ps3_joy_node])

Hi everyone,
I am new to ROS. I was following the on using a ps3 controller to operate turtlesim but unfortunately I have encountered the following error after I use "roslaunch learning_ps3joy turtle_ps3joy.launch":
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ps3joy/ps3_joy_node]: can't locate node [ps3_joy_node] in package [ps3joy]
I can see the turtlesim window with its turtle in it. I completed the tutorial to configure a ps3 controller and I was able to see it work with no errors.
Any ideas on why this is happening?
Edit 1:
I have a feeling the problem is in the launch file when executing the ps3joy node. Here is the code as it is shown in the tutorial:

Edit 2:
One thing that I have noticed is when I run roscd joy or roscd ps3joy the directory lies in /opt/ros/groovy/share/joy and /opt/ros/groovy/share/ps3joy. I have found the joy_node file in /opt/ros/groovy/lib/joy and the ps3joy_node.py in /opt/ros/groovy/lib/ps3joy directories.
Under the /opt/ros/groovy/share/joy directory all I see are:
cmake  migration_rules  package.xml
And for /opt/ros/groovy/share/ps3joy
cmake  diagnostics.yaml  launch  package.xml

Which ROS version are you using?
Comment by Pedro_85 on 2013-05-22:
Groovy, sorry for not including that.

A:

The fuerte version of ps3_joy_node had already been a redirection to joy_node of package joy, naming its own use deprecated.
Apparently this was fully removed with groovy.
Please edit every launch file and tutorial you see with a call to joy_node ps3_joy_node into joy joy_node so this antiquity gets eliminated.

I have run rosmake ps3joy and it reported no errors. As I said before I was able to use the ps3joy package to receive information from my ps3 controller. I have a feeling that the problem lies in the launch file commands. I have pasted the code in the question.

It didn't work either. The result was similar but with joy instead of ps3joy. I have edited the question with more details I have found.

Now it's working. In addition to your suggestion, I modified the manifest file adding sensor_msgs to the dependencies. Then I ran rosrun ps3joy ps3joy_node.py and in a different terminal launched the learning_ps3joy. Thanks for your help.
