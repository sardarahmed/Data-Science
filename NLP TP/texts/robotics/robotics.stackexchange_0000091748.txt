Q:

ROS YOLO object dimensions measure

Hello everyone,
I am using ubuntu 16.04 with ROS kinetic. For my project work I have detected the door and door handle with YOLO darknet. For that I am using intel realsense d435 camera.
Now my questions are as follow :

How can I measure the distance between door and the camera.

How can I measure the height and width of the door.

How can I add the detected door in rviz 3d.

What data set have you trained YOLO on to recognize doors and door handles?  Thanks!!

I am facing nearly the same problem did you find anything ?

A:

YOLO is only going to give you a bounding box around the thing you want (of varying quality). You must do the remainder yourself based on the information you have. Lets think about what you have access to in this situation:

D435 depth
D435 RGB / bounding boxes
D435 Extrinsic to robot (presumably)

So, how I'd start this is to take the bounding boxes in the RGB frame and project them into the depth frame so that you now have a patch of the depth image corresponding to the detected object. From a set of points in a pointcloud/depth image you should be able to make a rough estimate of distance based on either naiively averaging or model fitting. This should give you distances. Height / width of the door you'll need to fit a model to it (plane should work fine, maybe with a segmentation based on color so you can remove wall that might have been added).
Now you want to visualize this all in RVIZ. You'll have to look at the rviz-able data types (or create your own) and think about ways to manipulate what you have into those.
