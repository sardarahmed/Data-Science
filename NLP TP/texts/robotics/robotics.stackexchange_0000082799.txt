Q:

How can I simulate in rviz or gazebo

I want to simulate many behaviors of wheeled mobile robot such as mapping or navigation.I have found that ROS have package like navigation and gmapping,how can I run this package in simulation environment?
thanks!

A:

Your simulated robot needs odometry and laser data to create maps. Odometry typically comes from your gazebo controller plugin. I used a controller from the hector_gazebo_plugins package (see http://wiki.ros.org/hector_gazebo_plugins). To generate simulated laser scan data you can use e.g. the Hokuyo plugin (see http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_gzplugins&cat=connect_ros#GPULaser).
If you do not have a simulated robot yet, you might want to start with an already existing robot model for Gazebo, like the TurtleBot simulator (http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator).
There are also tutorials around for using gmapping or amcl on the TurtleBot (see http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_navigation). These tutorials should also work on a simulated TurtleBot.
Good luck!

thanks,I did it,that looks so cool.But now I want to Setup and Configuration of the Navigation Stack on a Robot(link text)ï¼ŒI want to run navigation stack on turtlebot.is there any ways?What should I do to?  thank you !

I am glad to hear, that you got your simulation and gmapping up and running. The Gaitech EDU tutorials might help you to learn more about using the navigation stack on a TurtleBot: http://edu.gaitech.hk/turtlebot/map-navigation.html
