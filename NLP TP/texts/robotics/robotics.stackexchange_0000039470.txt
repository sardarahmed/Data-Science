Q:

Including header files in ros build system

Hi,
I have a cpp code with 3 header files for the same written by me. I want to port this code to ros including these header files in my package. I created a package with my .cpp code in src folder and changed the CMakeFile.txt to build the executable of the same. If i have to include these .h files as well to my code where do i place them in the package and how to build my code using the .h files.
Thanks,
Karthik

A:

The usual practice is to place your headers in include/package_name, referencing them like this:
#include <package_name/header_name.h>

You would fill in your own package_name and header_name, as appropriate.
They only need to be exported in the manifest.xml if other packages include them. Your question implies no need for that.

+1 for the link to the usual practice; I always wondered if those were written down somewhere.
