Q:

bloom pulls in older tagged version

While I'm making a release using bloom I noticed on the commandline that it pulled in an older tagged version. Why is that, and how can I make a release with the newest tagged version?
I manually made a release "0.8.0" on moveit_core github website (I thought I had to manually do so without using catkin_prepare_release, only because I had to increment from 0.6.15 to 0.8.0 for jade, which I had no idea how to achieve(*1)). But bloom wants to use 0.7.1, which is one older tag (and should be used for indigo but not for jade).
Not sure how related this is but looking at the list of releases page, comparing with other repositories where the latest tag I made by catkin_prepare_release, I noticed that the one I made manually (0.8.0 on moveit_core) seems highlighted, while in other repositories they look the same as older tags.

UPDATE *1 catkin_prepare_release has an option to allow specifying the new versions e.g. --bump or --version. See its help doc by -h.

A:

Is your track configuration in bloom set to the correct branch?

You're right; it was pointing to a wrong branch and now it starts working as expected after I corrected with --edit option of bloom.
