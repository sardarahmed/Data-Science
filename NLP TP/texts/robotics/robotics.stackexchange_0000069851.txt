Q:

Rosserial_arduino: URDF library fail to generate (missing dependencies)

Hi,
I am trying to setup the Arduino IDE according to the tutorial -> http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
However, I ran into this problem at the last step where i run the following command.
rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .

At the terminal, I received the result below. Any insight on what caused this and how to fix this? Thank you.
 *** Warning, failed to generate libraries for the following packages: ***
    urdf_tutorial (missing dependency: convex_decomposition)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/user/catkin_ws/install/share/rosserial_arduino/make_libraries.py", line 91, in <module>
    rosserial_generate(rospack, path+"/ros_lib", ROS_TO_EMBEDDED_TYPES)
  File "/home/user/catkin_ws/install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rosserial_client/make_library.py", line 584, in rosserial_generate
    raise Exception("Failed to generate libraries for: " + str(failed))
