Q:

PR2 install ros-hydro-pr2-desktop as in tutorial

I'm just trying to install hydro to the PR2. When I type   sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-pr2-desktop I have the following error:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-pr2-desktop

It's not able to locate the package. As explained in http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/PR2/hydro, the package source deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu precise main is one of my source.d files, nonetheless it doesn't detect the package. Any ideas???

I recently apt-got it from http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu. Could you retry? Check this http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/pool/main/r/ros-hydro-pr2-desktop/ to see if you are also able to see the debs.

sorry, I won't be able to test it with the robot until mid-January :/

A:

Siligon,
this will be available soon as all of the pr2-metapackages are building in the shadow-fixed repo. Give it another month or two, and the PR2 will be fully available in Hydro.

Thank you for the answer, I haven't been working with the robot in a long time. Some people in the lab are working right now with it. I just posted another question.
