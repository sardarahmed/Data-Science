Q:

Determine if another rosnode is subscribing to published topic?

Is there a way for a publisher to check if another node is online and/or if the other node has established subscriptions to topics?  (C++).  I want to ensure that I don't send a configuration command if the subscriber has not yet subscribed.
I've seen this before that you can do this, but I donâ€™t remember how.
Thanks!

A:

pub.getNumSubscribers() > 0
Depending on your application, consider a latched publisher.
