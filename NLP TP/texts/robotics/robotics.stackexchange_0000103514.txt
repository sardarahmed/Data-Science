Q:

Anybody tried Intel® Euclid™ Development Kit

I am a software engineer working mainly on robotic systems. I am wondering if anybody has tried the Intel 3D depth camera for robotic platform? How about its performance? From its description by Intel, it seems quite powerful and compact, I am considering to try this.

Hi,
I received my Euclid this week and I'm trying to understand the Intel Euclid aproach now. Seems to be easy to extent some basic behaviors for students.
I've used an Intel NUC i5 (16 GB Memory, 256 GB SSD disk) with R200 before and I will give Euclid a first try now.
I did not expect too much, but simple SLAM with my Roomba should work. This Eucid box is really comfortable and easy to handle. I expect for small projects, it's enough power and better than using a Raspi and a lot of additional own build modules for IMU, CAM and other IO modules.
Cheers
Chrimo

Please keep us updated. I have looked at it but it's a lot of money for a hobbyist. Is it stereo camera or projector and camera like kinect? It's not obvious on the website but they say it can be used outdoors.

I bet, this cooperation will give ros euclid users more informations for missing hw documentation and api.

Today, I'm tried the Euclid outdoors and I'm not very happy with the depth image...
Small trees or plants are not detected or shown.
Inside it is OK.
I need to check it without direct sun later.

After 2 month of working with Euclid, I must say:
Software and SDK are OK and have nice UI, but the hardware is unusable for real robots.
Poor accu and charging capabilities, instable overheated board design and very poor ros support for new integrated sensors.

Did it come with any 'promises' of 'ROS support' for the sensors?

no, still waiting for feedback... coming soon :-)
