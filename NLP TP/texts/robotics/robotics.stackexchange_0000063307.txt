Q:

Problem with drone simulator // [cvg_sim_test] is not a package or launch file name

Hi,
i tried to install package tum_simulator but I found one problem.
When I try to run simulator:
roslaunch cvg_sim_test 3boxes_room.launch

i get:
[cvg_sim_test] is not a package or launch file name

I have ROS fuerte and installed gazebo 1.6, rviz.
I was adding step by step packages:
ardrone_autonomy package, joy_node and ardrone_joystick packages, tum_simulator package.
I used 'rosmake' and I didn't get any error.
My workspace looks:

przemek@przem:~/fuerte_workspace$ ls
ardrone_autonomy  sandbox     setup.sh
simulator_gazebo  visualization
ardrone_helpers   setup.bash
setup.zsh  tum_simulator

When I call echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
I get:

/home/przemek/fuerte_workspace/simulator_gazebo:/home/przemek/fuerte_workspace/sandbox:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros:/home/przemek/fuerte_workspace/ardrone_autonomy:/home/przemek/fuerte_workspace/ardrone_helpers:/home/przemek/fuerte_workspace/ardrone_helpers:/home/przemek/fuerte_workspace/tum_simulator

there is almost everything apart from rviz.
Please help me.

A:

It looks like the tum_simulator repository has a 'fuerte' branch which includes the cvg_sim_test package. Have you tried that version?

I was doing exactly what is on http://wiki.ros.org/tum_simulator.
So I cloned from git this link:
https://github.com/tum-vision/tum_simulator.git

now I see that it has branch master and below we can find info that it is for hydro.

So if i have ros-fuerte I should clone from this link?
https://github.com/tum-vision/tum_simulator/tree/fuerte

(Sorry for double comment but there is limit of characters..)

No. You already have a copy of the repository on your machine; you just need to check out the 'fuerte' branch. Try: roscd tum_simulator and git checkout fuerte

Thank you so much for your help, unfortunately before you wrote your answer I had reinstalled my ROS to Indigo version and just now successfully run simulator. :)
So I can't check it, but conclusion is to clone from git using parameter -b, for example: -b indigo
