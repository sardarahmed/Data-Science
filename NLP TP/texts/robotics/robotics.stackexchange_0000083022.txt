Q:

Link rospack to newer version of boost

I was follwing the ROS tutorials where I had to create the beginner tutorial package. I used the following command
catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp

After that when I tried out the follwing rospack command I got an error
 rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials 

The error is
rospack: error while loading shared libraries : libboost_filesystem.so.1.63.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Upon investigating, I realized that I have the boost version 1.65.1
How can I ask the ROS to look for the newer version of Boost?

Can you tell us how you installed ROS, and which platform / cpu arch / OS this is? Binary distributions of ROS come with very specific dependencies on specific Boost versions, so not having the Boost version that ROS requires is strange and unexpected.

A:

Thank you for the comment. I installed the Kinetic version of ROS on Arch Linux. I was able to solve the problem by doing an upgrade of the ROS packages. I had installed the ROS when I had the BOOST version 1.63.0, but later had done a system upgrade. ROS was linked to previous version of BOOST.

Could you please include such important information such as which OS you are running with your question next time? Installing on Arch immediately means 'from source' which needs a rather different when diagnosing your problems.
Without that info this would have been unsolvable.

I am sorry that I missed out to include that information, I will include the information in the future questions.
