Q:

Last Step of installation on RPi Failing

I'm following the Raspberry Pi Indigo installation guide here:  http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Indigo%20on%20Raspberry%20Pi
CMake is failing on the last step with this error: http://i.imgur.com/P9l5Gnr.jpg
==> Processing catkin package: 'ecl_time'
==> Building with env: '/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh'
==> cmake /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/ecl_core/ecl_time -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/devel_isolated/ecl_time -DCMA

Reproduce this error by running:
==> cd /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/build_isolated/ecl_time && /opt/ros/indigo/env.sh cmake /home/pi/ros_catkin_ws/src/ecl_core/ecl_timelease -G 'Unix Makefiles'

Command failed, exiting.

I'm not sure how to correct this.

Please copy/paste console output into your question text: if your image ever gets deleted / the host dies, this question (and future answer) will be useless.
Be sure to format console text using the preformatted text button (the one with 101010 on it).

I edited it.  It seems to be coming from
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/ecl_build/cmake/ecl_cx11.cmake:17 (message):
  Requested cxx11 flags, but this compiler does not support it.

but I don't know how to correct it.

A:

I get the same problem. Deleting the ecl_time package doesn't help because other packages depends on it.
Last June I  compiled it without problems.
Any help please

The problem seems resolved.
I substituted the ecl_time and ecl_devices folders with the ones in release 0.61.0 Sept 2014 and it compiles.
