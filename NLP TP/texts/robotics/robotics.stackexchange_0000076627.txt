Q:

How to convert .pcap to .las file

Hello, I am a complete freshman on Linux, ROS and velodyne so, Please help me with this. I want to process the velodyne data to create an point cloud. As velodyne give output in .pcap file  want to convert it into .las file. So that i can use it for point cloud generation. I have a raw .pcap file that i want to convert..
I tried with converting pcap to txt with tshark it convrt successfully. Then tried to convert txt to las using txt2las command but it give me error.
Error:

I have no idea what you are trying to accomplish with this.

velodyne gives the output in pcap format. But for point cloud software like ArcGIS does not support pcap file format.So i want to convert this pcap file captured from velodyne and convert it into LAS. so that i can process it and get point cloud ..

You have to convert your pcap data to .plc format then using cloud compare you can convert it into las format

Hi Nikka,
Can you guide me how you are converting pcap to .plc. Do you have any sample program?

Please go through this https://github.com/erik-nelson/blam

A:

This is not really a ROS question. If you just want to convert the PCAP to use other tools, ROS is neither required nor recommended.
If you do want to view the point cloud using ROS tools, try rviz, like the example in this tutorial:
