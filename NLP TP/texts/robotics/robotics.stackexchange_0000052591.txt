Q:

ROS installation failed

Hi !
I am trying to install ROS on a laptop in order to get it working with the Turtlebot2. I tried to install kobuki's packages thanks to this tutorial : http://www.ros.org/wiki/kobuki/Tutorials/Installation ; but something seems to have failed.
First, I couldn't do this step :
roscd kobuki_ftdi 
make udev

The computer answered :
make: *** No rule to make target `udev'.  Stop.

And I might say that I am not really sure about what this step of the installation is for.
Then, if I tried to launch any launch file or script,
roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch

the computer answered that the package doesn't exist :
[kobuki_node] is not a package or launch file name

Although I did follow all the previous step with success (except the udev one).
As you suggested, I also tried http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot/Tutorials/groovy/Installation
I ran :
. /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
rosrun kobuki_ftdi create_udev_rules

and got this answer :
This script copies a udev rule to /etc to facilitate bringing
up the kobuki usb connection as /dev/kobuki.

[sudo] password for turtlebot: 

Restarting udev

udev stop/waiting
udev start/running, process 4208

But whenever I try to roslaunch a kobuki_package I still got the same error as above (and I need the auto_docking package). If I try to run a turtlebot's package,
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

I got this error :
WARNING: unable to configure logging. No log files will be generated
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
WARNING: disk usage in log directory [/home/turtlebot/.ros/log] is over 1GB.
It's recommended that you use the 'rosclean' command.

Cannot locate [roslaunch]Invalid <param> tag: Cannot load command parameter [rosversion]: command [rosversion roslaunch] returned with code [1]. 

Param xml is <param command="rosversion roslaunch" name="rosversion"/>

I don't know what went wrong and any hint about how to fix the situation is welcome.

If you're following a tutorial, can you include a link to the one you're using? Also - copy&pasted error messages would be helpful.

I have the same problem, then when i try to roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch, my dashboard said Kobuki: Device does not exist. Waiting...

It might be a different problem than mine. It seems like your packages are correctly installed. Are you sure your bot is plugged to the computer and powered ?

What happens when you start a roscore, talker, and listener?

A:

I finally solved my problem. Here is what worked for me :

I uninstalled everything linked to ROS (with purge option), deleted opt and etc ros folders

I followed this tutorial : http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu until 1.5 Initialize rosdep step.

To install rosdep, I used this command line :
sudo pip install -U rosdep

That I found in this tutorial : http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosdep and checked that rosdep version was ok with this command line :
rosdep --version

(it has to be at least 0.10.19 version)

And then I followed 1.5 Initialize rosdep and following steps from the first quoted tutorial

And everything was working fine after that.

Why exactly do you used the pip version of rosdep and not the debian package python-rosdep? Or, does it make a difference? The debian version says it's 0.10.21
Comment by Lucile on 2013-07-10:
Well, it didn't work for me when I tried python-rosdep. I always ended up with 0.9.3 version when I used it. Even after I updated. I don't know why. There were three different instructions I could try, I tried them and this one was the only one which worked for me.
