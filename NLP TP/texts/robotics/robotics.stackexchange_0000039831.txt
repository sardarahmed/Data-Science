Hello Guys,
      I am currently working on **Husky A200**. I am finding difficulties in mapping the **lidar data** obtained from Husky A200, in order to map the environment.I am using **Hokuyo Lidar** and Ubuntu 11.10(Oneric Ocelot).Any help would be highly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance

Hey Arjun,
If you're just trying to visualize the laser data, the hokuyo_node package comes with a great launch file that sets up the driver and an rviz instance. See the package page for more info.
If you're wanting to run all of gmapping, your best bet might actually be to hold tight! We just got it set up with the Husky and a Kinect recently, and will be releasing those launch files in the next week or so. If you ping us at support@clearpathrobotics.com, we'll be sure to let you know right away when it's up, and we can help you adapt it for use with the Hokuyo.
Mike
