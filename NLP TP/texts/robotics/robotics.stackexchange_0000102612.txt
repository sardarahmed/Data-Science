Q:

No tf from some link to some link

I am new to ROS and I am working on OpenMANIPULATOR-X. Problems showed up as I try to use RViz. Error occurred to Robot Status showing No tf from some link to some link.
I know joint_state_publisher should be responsible for this and as I tapped command rostopic list, the topic joint_states is listed. The same happens to the node joint_state_publisher when I gave the command rosnode list.
However, when I input rosrun tf view_frames,I get a frame with only two links which indicates obviously that my joint_state_publisher is not working properly.
So I am really in need of someone who can help with this issue.

It would be more helpful to see the actual message instead of "some link" in No tf from some link to some link.
Please edit your question and add a link to the repository you followed for the package installation.

Just a quick note: joint_state_publisher publishes JointState msgs, it does not broadcast TF transforms. That's robot_state_publisher's job.
And actually, if you have a "robot driver" node, I would not expect a joint_state_publisher instance in the node graph (unless it's used to combine different topics into a single one).
