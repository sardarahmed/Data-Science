Q:

sensor_msgs::CvBridge or cv_bridge in hydro

Hi,
During adaptation from Electric to Hydro, I find that sensor_msgs::CvBridge is gone. Using cv_bridge doesn't work either. Looking through the wiki doesn't really help much. Any clue on how to get on ?
Thanks

Not a complete answer, but this tutorial is up to date for the latest version of cv_bridge: http://wiki.ros.org/cv_bridge/Tutorials/UsingCvBridgeToConvertBetweenROSImagesAndOpenCVImages

Thank you. Despite this tutorial and looking around I get compatibility issues like that cvToImgMsg is no member of cv_bridge. I assume that I have to re-code everything concerning cv_bridge and sensor_msgs.

It looks like cvToImgMsg is now toImageMsg and is a function on the CvImage class, rather than being a standalone function. Bottom line is, you'll probably have to rewrite most of your image conversions.
