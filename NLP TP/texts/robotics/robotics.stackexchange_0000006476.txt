Q:

How to run custom hardware from a laptop

I am looking to build some custom hardware (nothing too fancy, just some motors, cameras and the like), and I need it to be controlled by my laptop (its going to have to do a non-trivial amount of image processing).
Is there a way to attach $n$ motors to a laptop where $n<10$ via USB/e-SATA? It seems like something that should be very easy to solve, but I can't seem to find it anywhere.
I am not looking to get an Arduino/Raspberry Pi, really just connect the motors, and be able to control them individually. I am comfortable adding more power from a second source to supplement the USB power.
Ideas?

A:

The hardware you are looking for are the controllers from the canadian company Phidgets (http://www.phidgets.com/) 
They have lot of different sensor, actors and communication interfaces connected to a PC/Laptop with USB. The "physical Widgets" are pretty easy to use, because you get a relatively good API along with the boards.
The disadvantage of them: They cost a lot compared to the workaround solutions with arduino/ras-pi/mbed/beaglebone
