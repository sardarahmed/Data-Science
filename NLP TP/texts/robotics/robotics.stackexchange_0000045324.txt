Q:

How to make rosmake and distcc work together

I have setup a cross compiling environment to build ROS for RaspberryPi using distcc. Everything works fine with cmake and I have successfully built parts of ros. However, in the Debian install instructions when you get to Layer2 step 1.5, you issue:
rosmake -a

However, this doesn't call distcc. I have even tried:
CC="distcc arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc" CXX="distcc arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-g++" rosmake -a

with no success.
Any suggestions to get distcc and rosmake to work together? Again ... my setup does work fine with just cmake. Issueing:
CC="distcc arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc" CXX="distcc arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-g++" cmake .

inside a ros package works fine.
Thanks.

A:

I might have asked too soon. I had to set the env on the raspberry pi to:
export DISTCC_HOSTS=arch

where arch is my linux machine (x86 machine) doing the cross compiling. This is odd, because I already set arch in the ~/.distcc/hosts. It appears ROS needs the env set.
