Q:

Rviz ROS master incorrect ip address

Trying to run rviz in ubuntu 18.04
When running rviz, it says it's waiting for ROS master.
rviz: Waiting for master Could not contact ROS master at [http://192.168.31.200:11311], retrying...
But the ROS master is http://192.168.31.134:11311
Any assistance is appreciated
Edit:
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.31.134:11311
my ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME are commented out in bashrc

In the terminal where you are running rviz, it would really help to know the values of the environment variables ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP and/or ROS_HOSTNAME. Please edit your question and provide this information. You could run env | grep -e "ROS_[M,I,H]"

Also, if you want to do a bit of debugging while waiting for an answer, the value of ROS_MASTER_URI should be http://192.168.31.134:11311 (if that is where your master is running, as stated in the original question). The value for ROS_IP should be the IP address of the terminal where you are trying to run rviz (maybe 192.168.31.200). ROS_HOSTNAME should be unset.

ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME are commented out in bashrc as
#export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.168.13.184
#export ROS_IP=192.168.31.134

A:

Solved it, forgot to change the ROS_MASTER_URI ip to the current ip of 192.168.31.134
