Q:

frontier_exploration to do unbounded exploration

I am using the frontier_exploration [indigo]. I had troubles to use it, but now I know how to use it with limited settings.
What I really want to do is the unbounded exploration. The wiki reads
"To run an unbounded exploration task, simply leave the boundary blank."
I don't know what this means.
When I set polygon regions using "Publish Points" in rviz, the robot seemed to stop even though there are unknown regions, saying "Finished exploration room" message.
Could you help me run the unbounded exploration?
Here are my settings:

Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit)
Turtlebot gazebo simulator
Gmapping for map building
ROS: Indigo

can i apply into hydro?

A:

To do 'unbounded' exploration, you send an actionlib goal (either using a SimpleActionClient implementation, or by running actionlib's axclient.py) that contains an empty polygon.

does unbounded mean that it will start moving on its own and autonomously map the environment?
