Q:

"unable to load manifest" error after subscribe via RosSharp/RosBridge

Using Unity and the RosSharp library I'm able to connect but unable to subscribe to any custom .msg types. The types are correctly named in the RosSharp dictionary and builds fine on the ROS side. After requesting to subscribe it will throw the error on the rosbridge socket terminal:
unable to load the manifest for package ####. Caused by ####
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/kinetic/share
Any thoughts?
Thanks,
Lane

Is package ### present in your workspace / installed on your system? Does rospack find #### return the expected output (in the same terminal as where you start the RosBridge nodes)? I don't see any Catkin workspace in the error output, so did you source it?

the package is present, rospack find identifies it and i did source ./devel/setup.bash after the catkin_make.

This works on a linux box, but fails on my VirtualBox VM - identical projects.

A:

Just making sure: the terminal where you started rosbridge also had sourced the workspace setup.bash?

Edit:

Wow, did not realize that was required for each new terminal.

Yes, that is needed in every terminal. See #q286466 for a recent question about this.

Wow, did not realize that was required for each new terminal. Seems to be working fine, thanks =)

run source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash in the bridge terminal window.
