Q:

Is there a way I can force the robots to be already localized?

I want the robots to be already localized when I start the program. Is there any way for this, so that I do not have to move the robot manually and localize it?
I have two robots and in order to explore with the second robot, I have to localize it first which takes a lot of time. By the time I localize it, the other robot explores whole of the map.
Thanks

A:

If you are using amcl, you can set initial pose estimate of the robot by publishing to /initialpose topic. Also there is a visual tool for this in rviz, which is named as "2D Pose Estimate". Is this what you need?

Yes, I tried clicking he 2D Pose Estimate in hope that my localization will be done faster. But there is no decrease in localization time. By the time I localize it, the other robot finishes whole map. Is there a way, i can manually localize before the program starts?

You can try publishing on /initialpose programmatically or on terminal instead of using rviz. This may result in faster localization. Or you may make the other robot wait until first robot localizes.
