Q:

DRCsim-1.3.1 seems not to work with tutorials

I just patched to DRCsim-1.3.1, but now when I load up the environment different things happen, all of them bad.  When I just run atlas_utils atlas.launch, the robot loads but falls down, saying l_leg_uhz was not calibrated, and that it's missing drc vehicle and fire_hose_model.  When I run atlas_utils atlas_position_controllers, I get all kinds of controller initialization errors, and again it's missing the vehicle and fire hose.  Not sure what changed, the directory names sure didn't change with the update.

A:

The errors about missing the firehose and vehicle models can be ignored.  There's a pull request pending that downgrades them to info messages.
As for the robot falling down; not sure what's going on there.  There's a chance that you're experiencing an ABI-breaking change in the other direction (newly compiled drcsim with older ROS packages).  I would try getting a fresh install of ROS:
sudo apt-get remove ros-fuerte-*
sudo apt-get install drcsim
