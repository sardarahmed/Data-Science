Q:

Language model with grammar for Pocketsphinx

Hi
Does anyone know if there's a way to include grammar in the language model for Pocketsphinx? Either by using a jsgf-file or something else.
Any ideas would be appreciated.

A:

The Pocketsphinx ROS package is based on gstreamer's pocketsphinx plugin. As far as I know, this does not accept the jsgf-files. This question has come up a few times, but as far as I know, nobody has found a way to make it work.
