Q:

I have a python program. How can I integrate ROS data in it?

Hi,
I have a python program running perfectly. Now I need some data in the program which is being published on a rostopic. In the ros environment, I know I can get that data using rostopic echo, or save it in a text file.
Can I add something in my python program that it collects data on a ros topic and use it? All I want is that everytime my program runs, there is a new data it collects from rostopic and does the operation on it.
Right now my program is using a dummy data and I urgently need to replace it with actual data being published over a rostopic.
urgent, please.

A:

If this is truly urgent, you should consider reading the basic ROS tutorials.
You will probably find Writing a Publisher and Subscriber in Python helpful.
