Q:

How to calculate Current for pancake stepper motor - To change in Pronterface

DISCLAIMER: New to electrical engineering topics. I'm a 3d-printing hobbyist. I don't know all the Jargon being used but trying my best to keep up.
PROBLEM
Recently bought a Nema 17 stepper pancake motor to replace the Ender 3 extrusion stepper. It's only used for direct extrusion with a BMG 3/1 gear ratio, which leads me to believe it doesn't need a lot of juice to have it work optimally.
*Got this from TriangleLab:*

This thin stepper is running very hot. Via pronterface and/or octoprint, I adjusted the "current" from the default ender 3 E850 to E50, using command M906 and saving with M500.
It is still running hot and TriangleLab hasn't been very forthcoming.

NOTE: i'm not sure what "current" is being referred to, amps or voltage. I just followed this youtuber's advice for the adjustment...
Used this guy's method: https://youtu.be/GHUr1a3nXDU
Question
How do I know if the stepper is running TOO hot?
(not sure what the consequences of a hot stepper might be, other than the thing burning out and becoming a fire hazard.)
Is there a calculation that is better than just eyeballing the situation and doing random tweaks?
Any info would be much appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
**Triangle Lab's Stepper specifications**

NEMA 17

 - per phase 5.1 Ω 5.9mH
 - 21 N/cm Holding Torque
 - 23mm Body
 - 20mm Output Shaft(5mm diameter)(17mm D-Shaped)

A:

Current is amps. The set of specifications you gave states

1.0 Amp

so as long as your current is <= 1.0 Amp then it doesn't really matter how hot it's getting because the motor is rated for that current.
