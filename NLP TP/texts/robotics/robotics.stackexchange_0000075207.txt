Installing ROS indigo on Raspbian jessie apt-get update fail - Failed to fetch ../../../../..armhf/Packages

I think you have to build ROS from source. The Debian packages are not for ARMhf architectures. With the exception of Ubuntu for ARMhf.

A:

ROS Kinetic is only supported for Debian Jessie on amd64 and arm64 (64-bit ARM) processors; not armhf.
Have a look at http://answers.ros.org/question/239466/incomplete-packages-for-kinetic-armhf-jessie/
