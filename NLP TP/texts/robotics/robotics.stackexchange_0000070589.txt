Q:

Confuse about env name and env loader

Here is my launch file:
<launch>
  <group ns="rover1">
    <env name="ROS_MASTER_URI" value="http://Master:11311"/> 
    <machine name="Slaver1" address="Slaver1" user="pi"  env-loader="/opt/ros/indigo/env_rover.sh" />
    <machine name="Master"  address="Master"  user="hlr" env-loader="/opt/ros/indigo/env_rover.sh" /> 
    <node pkg="rover_net" name="ControlNode" type="ControlNode" />
    <node machine="Slaver1" pkg="rover_net" name="SensorNode" type="SensorNode" />
    <node machine="Slaver1" pkg="rosserial_python" name="serial_node" type="serial_node.py" args="/dev/ttyACM0" />
  </group>
</launch>

AND below is my env-loader file:
#!/bin/sh
. /home/pi/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh
exec "$@"

My qustion is since I have set the ROS_MASTER_URI but the remote machine is also:
Slaver1-0]: ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:1131

unless I add:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://Master:11311

It seems that the env name have no work. I am confuse about How the args we set in the launch file pass to the env_rover.sh?
Thank for Anything Help!

A:

The problem you mentioned is probably because one can not set environment variable on the remote machine if you not set it inside machine tag. In your case the variable will be only set on local (master) computer.
