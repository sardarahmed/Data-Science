Q:

python-rosdep in xenial archives, but dependencies are broken

So it seems that rosdep is in universe for Xenial, which would be nice, if it worked. However, all it depends upon is python-yaml-- it doesn't depend on python-rospkg, python-catkin-pkg, or python-rosdistro, all of which it needs. So for example when one tries to initialize the database one is greeted with:
ImportError: No module named rospkg.os_detect

Is this a known issue?

Hi Kyle,
thanks a lot for having a look at the packages and thanks to Dirk for pinging me. I've just pushed a fixed version into unstable, which should transition to Xenial soon. As Dirk wrote, the packages are still new, but we are happy to get bug reports, ideally through the Debian bug tracker or through Launchpad.
