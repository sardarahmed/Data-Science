A:

Sounds like the previous step hasn't worked out. Maybe you forgot
sudo apt-get update

So it's probably going to work if you start over.
Otherwise please post the output of
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list

Either that or forgot to add the repository from the first instruction, I managed to do it as I'm new to linux
