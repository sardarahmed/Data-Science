Q:

how to edit in turtlebot _description package

Hi ,
I am successfully build a map in rviz for a simple_office.world. now I want to edit in robot description to remove gyro from the robot model that loaded to gazebo.
There is a package turtlebot_description/urdf/files.urdf.xacro ... so I think The gyro is defined in turtlebot_body.urdf.xacro, but I can not edit on it ..
How to edit it to remove gyro part .. also want to know if there is another files I have to edit on
I want to remove gyro, because I do not have a gyro on my real iRobot Create base..
any suggestion
Thanks

Hi Amal!
You probably have installed the turtlebot_description package via a debian package. Thus, it was installed as sudo and if you want to edit it, you need to use sudo as well.
A better way would be to download the turtlebot_description package as source and copy it into your workspace. Remember to modify your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in order to use the source install and not the debian package.
Have a look at this wiki entry for more details: http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Overlays
Good luck!

I can edit now on this files .. what files do you think I have to edit on to remove gyro ?!

If you are only concerned about the gyro simulation, commenting out "<turtlebot_sim_imu/>" will probably be enough. If needed also remove the gyro link and joint.
