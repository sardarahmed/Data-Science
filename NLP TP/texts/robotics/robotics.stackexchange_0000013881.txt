Q:

My Plug Says It's USB, I can't Identify

I ordered this cool little USB endoscope camera, but the cord does not look like any type of USB I have ever seen. I would eventually like to make this act like a webcam, so does that make a difference? It looks like this:
The back is just flat. I tried plugging in an Arduino RedBot cord because I had one lying around, it doesn't fit.

USB is more than just a connector.  It is a standard communications protocol, voltage levels, and even wiring colors.  

I suggest you get a standard USB cable, cut it in half, then splice in your wires.  http://wikipedia.org/wiki/USB does a good job of describing the pin outs on the various USB connectors.
