Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: NO MAP DATA

I am using the Lidar from the XV-11 Neato vacuum cleaner. I have the point cloud data available and is visible in RVIZ. However, I am not able to get any map data. I get the following error message in RVIZ
No tf data.  Actual error: Fixed Frame [/neato_laser] does not exist
This is a global Status warning and is shown next to Fixed frame tab.
Kindly suggest what I should do. Also, is it even possible to get that kind of data from the Lidar unit from the XV-11 Neato.
I am working on the Ubantu version of ROS.

Thans allenh1....
Can you elaborate where the changes can be made that are mentioned in the tutorial (for hector_slam)?
Im really in a fix here.

Have a look at the tutorial: http://www.ros.org/wiki/hector_slam/Tutorials/SettingUpForYourRobot

Im getting this error when I run RVIZ. I also tried to put all the 3 options listed.
Message from [/neato_laser_publisher] has a non-fully-qualified frame_id [neato_laser]. Resolved locally to [/neato_laser].  This is will likely not work in multi-robot systems.  This message will only print once.

I suspect you set the fixed frame to neato_laser? Then the message is OK. For mapping you probably want /map as the fixed frame.

Thanks. But the hector_slam is not working. Where do i implement it?
It keeps saying that no such package available.
Again, I am using the ELECTRIC version of ROS.

So are you running any SLAM node? If not that would explain why you don't have a map. For obtaining hector_slam, just click on any of the links here, you can also use gmapping.
Comment by rzv0004 on 2012-07-23:
After I changed the fixed frame to /map the following error appeared.
For frame [neato_laser]: Fixed Frame [/map] does not exist
I tried to install the hector_slam_launch package but I got the message that no such package exists. I tried rosmake, rosdep, and rosdep install commands. None worked.HELP

Did you install and rosmake the hector_slam stack?

A:

Do you have something that provides tf?
Your robot should be setup to provide /base_link -> /neato_laser (or whatever frame the laser is published in) and also send /odom -> /base_link. For mapping you will also need to run SLAM, e.g. gmapping.

http://ros.org/wiki/tf You can use the static transform there. If you just want to map with laser data, try hector_slam: http://www.ros.org/wiki/hector_slam
