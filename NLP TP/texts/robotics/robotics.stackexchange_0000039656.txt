Q:

What are the differences between getNodeHandle() and getPrivateNodeHandle() in nodelet?

I found some examples of nodelets used both getNodeHandle() and getPrivateNodeHandle () to get the ros::NodeHandleï¼Œ and I felt that they had the same effects. So what are the exact deferences between getNodeHandle() and getPrivateNodeHandle () in nodelet?

A:

Private node handles are used for accessing resources (advertising, subscribing topics, parameters, ...) in the nodelet's private namespace. The non-private version should give a node handle in the manager's namespace.
Example: you run a nodelet foo in the manager named bar. When advertising the topic baz using the private node handle, the topic should be something like that:
/bar/foo/baz
When using the non-private node handle, you should get:
/bar/baz
