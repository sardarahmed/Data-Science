Q:

Can a node act as a server and a publisher?

Hello all,
I have a piece of hardware (LabJack UE9) I am using to interface with a diesel generator for data acquisition as well as for some simple controls (turning it on and off), and I would like to have the node that interfaces with it to be capable of both publishing acquired data and servicing client requests to turn the generator on and off. Is this possible? I have successfully implemented client/servers as well as publishers/subscribers, but I am having problems stitching them together.
Thanks
Gideon

A:

Yes it can, although I am still uncertain what happens to the published messages when the service takes a while to fulfill the request. For anyone else trying to do this, I found the stitching together of examples from the tutorials much easier once I found class based examples (http://www.ros.org/wiki/roscpp_tutorials/Tutorials/UsingClassMethodsAsCallbacks)

Once the message has been "published" the service call will not effect it.
