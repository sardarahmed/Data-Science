Q:

trouble creating launch file

hello Guys ,
I am trying to create a launch file which would execute the command:
rosrun  ardrone_brown ardrone_driver
so here is the launch file:

roslaunch ardrone_brown ardronematlab.launch

and here is the corresponding output when I execute the launch file::
... logging to /home/karthik/.ros/log/88e084e4-84d4-11e1-a4e9-f04da263aca7/roslaunch-karthik-laptop-6444.log
Checking log directory for disk usage. This may take awhile.
Press Ctrl-C to interrupt
Done checking log file disk usage. Usage is <1GB.

A:

It seems like your node exits immediately. To find out why, a few hints:
Check the log file printed at the end of roslaunch for any output related to the shutdown. You can also add output="screen" to see console output, i.e.:
<launch>
  <node name="ardrone_driver" pkg="ardrone_brown" type="ardrone_driver"
        output="screen" /> 
</launch>
