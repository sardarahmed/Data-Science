Q:

Best choice for controlling GPIOs (published messages or service calls)

Hello,
Sorry if this is an already answered question, but despite a couple of hours spent googling the Web and searching in this forum, I couldn't find.
What is the rule of thumb for deciding if some control operation should be implemented using published messages or service calls ?
For controlling robot moves, I could see that the standard way is to use Twist messages published on the /cmd_vel topic. But what about controlling GPIOs for instance ? Should this be using published messages too or service calls ?
Since there is no feedback when using messages (you can't know if somebody heard them and process them), I would be tempted to use service calls instead.
Thanks in advance for any advice. Best regards.
Eric

A:

The best choice is going to depend on your particular application.
A few rules of thumb:

If you need to guarantee that the other node got the message, use a service
If you need a response, use a service (or an action)
If you need speed, use a topic
If you don't care if every message goes through, use a topic
If you are interacting with some existing topic/service API, use whatever that API already uses

Note that it also doesn't have to be one or the other. Some nodes (such as move_base) provide both a topic and action API for the same thing.

Thanks Dan for you quick reply. You confirm what I had concluded from studying existing material. The very last point was also something I had in mind. Regards.
