Q:

ROS Nav Stack - Obtaining correct heading at the goal without final pointturn

Hi
I am using ROS Indigo with the Navigation stack on a holonomic vehicle. The planning overall seems to work
However, once the robot reaches the XY goal it does a final pointturn. Is there a way to have it plan an arc so that when the destination is reached the heading is already correct?
It also seems to now like holonomic motions. Is there a way to bias the planner to use more holonomic motions (note: the planner has holonomic set to true).
Thanks

A:

For the first part of your question (heading), you can try setting the global_planner's orientation filter to ForwardThenInterpolate (maybe experiment with all of them). You can read what each filter does here: GlobalPlanner.cfg
It looks like you'll have to use dynamic_reconfigure in order to set the filter.
