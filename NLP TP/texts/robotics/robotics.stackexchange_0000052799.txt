Q:

How to write rostests using Python under catkin?

This page gives excellent instructions for on how to write and run unit tests for ROS using Python.  The trouble is, it is 3 years old and only covers rosbuild, not catkin.
I have seen the docs for catkin_add_nosetests but that doesn't describe interactions with rostest.
Maybe it is as simple as add_rostest() with a test-launch file that includes a python test program?

Here's a small combined rostest and Python example that seems to work: https://github.com/jack-oquin/camera_info_manager_py

A:

In the nice doc @joq is volunteering on, there's also a section about testing that includes rostest integration.

Update) Now looks like the same documentation (?) has been integrated into the official doc (for Hydro).

Thanks for the testimonial, Isaac. I do still need to add more examples for the complex interactions of rostest with gtest and nosetest.
