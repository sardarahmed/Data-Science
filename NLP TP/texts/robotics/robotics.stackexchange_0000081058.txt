Q:

Intel realsense SR300 on ROS indigo

Hello everyone,
I am trying to use the sr300 RGBD sensor on ros indigo. I use librealsense(https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) and realsense_camera(https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense) package that intel provides.
I have encountered two problems.

RGB-Depth registration has large errors
XYZRGB pointcloud suddenly does not get published, even though rgb and registered depth images get published as normal.

Does anyone have any experience with this sensor? Is there a way to calibrate the sensor and get a better registration? Is there a different package that I can use?
Thank you in advance!
