Q:

Getting endpoint states of robot

I'm using a Baxter and I want to get the endpoint states of my robot. The endpoint states are located in the topic
/robot/limb/left/endpoint_state

and on the terminal I can echo this topic to get the endpoint states. Running this would yield:
pose:
position:
x: some double
y: some double
z: some double
orientation:
...

I only need the pose x y and z position data. My guess is to get this, I need to subscribe to this topic, but I'm not sure how I would subscribe to it to get just that data.

A:

There are two ways to do this:

subscribe to the topic. This is the easy way. I highly recommend this method as apposed to the following. You will just take the message and use the parts you need. If you are using C++ or Java, you will use the variables like you would a struct.

Please don't do this to yourself... The other method would be to interpret the echo as a string, and parse through it. This is extremely unnecessary, and will only slow things down.

I have no intention of doing the latter, and I've been stuck on number 1. for a couple days now. When I subscribe to the topic, how do I only extract the information I need, i.e. the x y and z of the pose? As in how would the callback work?
