Q:

Contrib modules on ros-opencv 2.4

I have ros indigo installed on my laptop (ubuntu-14.04), I want to run opencv code which require contrib modules. How can I install those modules with ros-indigo opencv 2.4?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I think the only so-called solution hack is referenced here : modify where python looks for modules.
Also related but without actual solution: this post and that one.
Hope it's useful to you !

I tried the way these links talks about but nothing worked. The problem might be due to the fact that i am running ros & ubuntu on ARM processor.
