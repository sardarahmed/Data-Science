Q:

Starting a new project: Start with Groovy or wait for Hydro?

I'm starting a new ROS project. As I was documenting myself and learning how everything worked, I noticed that ROS Hydro was releasing next month.
Is it worth waiting to start a new project or could I start right away on Groovy and eventually upgrade? If it's the latter, how hard would it be to upgrade from Groovy to Hydro?

A:

I'd start now with Groovy (or maybe even Fuerte like @davinci, depending on your needs).
According to REP 003, Groovy will be supported on Oneiric, Precise and Quantal. There was a recent discussion on the mailing list regarding how to map ROS releases to Ubuntu LTS releases, but I'm not sure if it has propagated anywhere on the wiki.
You might also be interested at the recent survey results regarding how often people upgrade their ROS distro (short version - most people do NOT upgrade immediately upon release.) There is also a survey on which operating systems are in use.
