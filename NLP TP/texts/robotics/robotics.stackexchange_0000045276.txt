Q:

roslaunch and ports

I may be missing something, but if it's possible to start roslaunch (roscore) on a specific port.. shouldn't it be possible/necessary to pass a port to tools like rostopic so they can communicate with the "right" ros graph?

A:

That's what ROS_MASTER_URI is for. You can start roscore on a different port with the --port parameter, e.g.:
roscore --port=11411

Then set the ROS_MASTER_URI to the new URI:
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11411

Now, all ros nodes should contact the core on port 11411. That way, you can run several ros cores on the same machine.

Ah yes.. thanks.. not sure why I forgot about the env var.. but this is how I'd use it (for reference) ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11411 rostopic list
