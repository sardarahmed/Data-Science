Q:

gzclient throwing Ogre::InvalidParametersException

Hello all. I am attempting to build Gazebo from source this weekend. I was able to get everything built however when I attempt to run the gzclient I get an exception. Could this possible be due to my building of OGRE manually? I couldn't use the default OGRE as it was missing a Cg plugin. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Additional info
I am running Ubuntu.
Description:    Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS
Release:    12.04
Codename:   precise
Here is the output for gzclient. gzserver was already running with the empty world.

A:

So I figured this one out on my own. Turns out that all I needed to do was to upgrade my graphics driver. You need the latest drivers to support the configuration used by Gazebo. I was using NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version 173) and I switched to NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version current)[Recommended]
