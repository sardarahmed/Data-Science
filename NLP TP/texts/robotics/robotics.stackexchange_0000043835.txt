Q:

Cannot build rosjava (on mac) -without- ROS installed?

Hi, I am trying to build rosjava  (OS X 10.6.8, 32-bit, Java 1.6 without installation of ROS) based on this rosjava tutorial.
I was successfull to install it on Ubuntu 12 with Fuerte installed, everything worked.
But now, on Mac, after running:
./gradlew install

the maven repostitory on robotbrains seems to be down, i get:
    :apache_xmlrpc_common:compileJava
Checksum missing at http://robotbrains.hideho.org/nexus/content/groups/ros-public/org/apache/commons/com.springsource.org.apache.commons.httpclient/3.1.0/com.springsource.org.apache.commons.httpclient-3.1.0.pom.sha1 due to: Connection to http://robotbrains.hideho.org refused
Checksum missing at http://robotbrains.hideho.org/nexus/content/groups/ros-public/org/apache/ws/commons/ws-commons-util/1.0.1/ws-commons-util-1.0.1.pom.sha1 due to: Connection to http://robotbrains.hideho.org refused

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':apache_xmlrpc_common:compile'.
> Could not resolve group:org.apache.commons, module:com.springsource.org.apache.commons.httpclient, version:3.1.0.

I found this solution but it causes these further errors:
...

...  

(and 22 similar ones)
So, this means that on this maven repository are some old libraries, or rosjava is not that standalone and needs ROS installation on a computer too? :(
(Unfortunately, I cannot upgrade Java to newer version, because it seems that 1.7 is not supported for 32-bit systems)
Thank you very much for help.

A:

OK, problem solved, turns out that the rosjava depends on several ROS (mainly low level communication) libraries.
so i copied folder /opt/ros/fuerte/include (from ROS barebones installation for Ubuntu) onto Mac, exported the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and then installation succeeds:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/folder/include/
./gradlew install
