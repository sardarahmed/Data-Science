Q:

Streaming theora

Hi all,
I am streaming video  captured by web cam. I use the usb_cam node to capture and compress video using theora codec and the image_view node to play the stream. In order to transport data from  a computer to another remote one via wireless, I use the   ros_rt_wmp node (our node that implements a multihop protocol).
It works, but with some "strange aspects".  Video data reaches the remote node, and with remap to the  image_view node , but I am able to see the video ONLY if this  image_view node is already opened in the receiver computer and on the SENDER computer. If not, data reaches destination computer  but aren't played by the image_view.
Any idea about that?

A:

Image transport uses a different topic for each image compression; are you sure you're forwarding the correct topics? You may also want to forward the camera_info topic.
Take a look at http://ros.org/wiki/image_transport for more information.
EDIT 1:
Does the remote(forwarded) image_view continue to work after you close the local image_view? If so, then the local image_view is doing some sort of setup that the remote image_view isn't able to do, probably because something isn't forwarded properly.
You may want to look at which services your camera node advertises, and try forwarding those.
