Q:

rospy Custom message; "ImportError: No module named msg"

Having trouble getting python to accept a custom message.  I have performed, what I believe to be, the necessary steps to package.xml and CMakelists.txt.  I feel that I perform the task as outlined in the tutorials: catkin_make etc.
I am able to find my custom message:
$rosmsg package ssimsim
ssimsim/parsedDiagMsg

when attempting to invoke this custom message type, i am met with:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/traxx/catkin_ws/src/ssimsim/scripts/nmeaparser.py", line 7, in <module>
    from ssimsim.msg import parsedDiagMsg
ImportError: No module named msg

I am calling it as follows:
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('ssimsim')
import rospy

from std_msgs.msg import String
from ssimsim.msg import parsedDiagMsg

I have tried several permutations of the from/import, based off various ROS help topics with little success.  The  .msg throwing the error I am finding more than odd.
help greatly appreciated

Does the output from catkin_make show that the messages from your package are built successfully?
Comment by Dirk Thomas on 2013-12-30:
With catkin you should remove the "roslib.load_manifest" line since it is not necessary anymore.

A:

This sounds similar to the problem I just had and it was solved here.  The cause was that the name of the my Python script that was trying to import the message was the same as the name of my package.  Apparently having the same name confuses the import statement under catkin although it worked OK using rosbuild.
