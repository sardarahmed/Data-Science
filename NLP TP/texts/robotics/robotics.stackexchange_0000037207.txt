Q:

Launch file for turtlebot dashboard?

Hi!
Related to this post that talks about multiple robots under one core. Oviously I want to be able to see the dashboards for each robot, so I created this launchfile:

<launch>
  <arg name="multiple" default="false"/>
  <group if="$(arg multiple)" ns="$(arg robot)">
    <node pkg="turtlebot_dashboard" type="turtlebot_dashboard" name="turtlebot_dashboard"/>
  </group>
  <group if="$(arg multiple)">
    <node pkg="turtlebot_dashboard" type="turtlebot_dashboard" name="turtlebot_dashboard"/>
  </group>
</launch>

but I get this output:

roslaunch turtlebot_dashboard dasboard.launch 
... logging to /home/albert/.ros/log/9bcf1e54-435b-11e1-8782-ccaf78899509/roslaunch-albert-XPS-M1530-4631.log

A:

In your launch file, the two conditionals for launching inside a namespace or not are the same.  I think it should be:
<launch>
  <arg name="multiple" default="false"/>
  <group if="$(arg multiple)" ns="$(arg robot)">
    <node pkg="turtlebot_dashboard" type="turtlebot_dashboard" name="turtlebot_dashboard"/>
  </group>
  <group unless="$(arg multiple)">
    <node pkg="turtlebot_dashboard" type="turtlebot_dashboard" name="turtlebot_dashboard"/>
  </group>
</launch>
