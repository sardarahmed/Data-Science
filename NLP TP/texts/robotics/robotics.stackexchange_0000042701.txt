Q:

"unmet dependencies" error when installing ROS on ubuntu12.04

Hello,
I have recently upgraded to Ubunto 12.0.4 and trying to reinstall ROS (Fuerte version). I have got the following error message. Even installing each package separately doesn't help. It seems that I am stuck inside a loop of dependencies.
p.s. Still I have the old version of ROS on my computer; No idea how to get rid of it.
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-desktop-full

A:

You can remove electric with
sudo apt-get remove ros-electric-*

After that you can try to re-install fuerte. I assume that some package's system library dependency conflicts with your previously installed electric versions, which won't be available for 12.04.
