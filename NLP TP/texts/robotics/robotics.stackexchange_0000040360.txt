Q:

how to get and read the data from kinect

I need to use the data from kinect,and i have installed the stack openni_kinect;so if i want to get and read the data from kinect,should i need to create a node to publish the relative messages? and how should i create? Or is there another way to complete it? In addition i did not find any information about "publisher" or "service" in the stack openni_kinect.

A:

You're going to want to use the openni_camera package and the openni_launch package. The openni_launch package should have everything you need to get started.
