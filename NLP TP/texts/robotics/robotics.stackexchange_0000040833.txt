Q:

EDIT:Setting up environment pr2_gazebo on ubuntu 11.4?

I have a dual boot with Mac OSx 10.6.8 and Ubuntu 11.4, I am attempting to get pr2_gazebo empty_world.lanch up and running.
I am able to rosmake and run gazebo_worlds, but not the specific pr2 simulator.
Here some relevant terminal feed: There seems to be a problem with finding pr2_gazebo (as William said) Any ideas on the source of the problem (and how to fix it)?
catherine@SHERLOCK:~$ rosmake pr2_gazebo
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['pr2_gazebo']
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory/home/catherine/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20120527-172708
[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['pr2_gazebo'] to:
[]
[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['pr2_gazebo']
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
All input is welcome. Thank you for your time.

A:

I fixed it. For some reason all of the stacks were not downloaded although I did the full desktop download, so I downloaded the appropriate stack.
$ sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-pr2-simulator
