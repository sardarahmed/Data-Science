Q:

Autonomous navigation with Turtlebot3 algorithm

Hi,
i tried to develop in C++ with success (basically i'm still a beginner with ROS development) a way for autonomous exploration of n turtlebot3  in an unknown environment (like turtlebot3 house for example). The algorithm is too much "simple",basically i check the laserscan distance from an obstacle and if obstacle distance is less than 0.5 meter robots turn left by 90 degrees.
What i'm looking for now is a more sophisticated algorithm to implement in C++ and an algorithm that "turn aroung" fixed and mobile obstacles (like walking human for example)
I found the relaxed A* algorithm on github but it's useless for me cause it's based on well known map and find the optimal path from a start to a goal point.
Suggestions?

A:

Hello! I've had a lot of luck with this autonomous exploration package explore_light on my turtlebot3. It is an improved version of the frontier_exploration package. Maybe it's source code will provide some inspiration for you if you'd rather build your own.
