Q:

TurtleBot Autonomous Navigation Not Moving to Desired Point

I'm following the tutorial on Autonomous Navigation of a known map for Turtlebot here
http://www.ros.org/wiki/turtlebot_navigation/Tutorials/Autonomously%20navigate%20in%20a%20known%20map
Rviz Shows up, my map shows up, obstacles show up. Everything looks good basically, but whenever I choose a 2D Nav Goal after choosing a 2D Pose Estimate, the TurtleBot won't move to that point. I don't understand why, but here is the output of
roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/tmp/my_map.yaml

Hi, I do not now much about turtlebot navigation, but I'd guess your localization doesn't work. Try using tags without hashes (#), so the right people get to see your question.

Did initialise the robot's pose on the map?

I also have same problem. My turtlebot works correctly with keyboard teleop, but doesn't work with an autonomous navigation I follow ROS web(autonomously navigate in a known map). I doubt that /mobile_base/commands/velocity doesn't respond.

A:

Update: Try shutting down the teleop node if you have it running in parallel. For some reason it blocks the autonomous navigation even when you aren't sending any commands.
I have the same problem. I am running everything in simulation for now. It worked ONCE when I restarted everything but before and after that it doesn't. I'm using Hydro on Ubuntu 12.04.
I'm actually trying to run it on the Clearpath Husky robot and had some problems with that so thought of trying it on the turtlebot in simulation since Husky packages are based on these. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

did you solve the issue?
Comment by 2ROS0 on 2014-10-13:
Yes. The teleop node was running in parallel. So.

This solved a similar problem for me.
