Q:

Issue during 'roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch'

Hello everybody!
I have Ubuntu 16.06 Xenial and ROS Kinetic installed. I want to launch gazebo turtlebot simulation with a command:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

At first, I installed turtlebot using:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot ros-kinetic-turtlebot-apps ros-kinetic-turtlebot-interactions ros-kinetic-turtlebot-simulator ros-kinetic-kobuki-ftdi ros-kinetic-rocon-remocon ros-kinetic-rocon-qt-library ros-kinetic-ar-track-alvar-msgs

Then launching gazebo turtlebot simulation I got a typical error:
[turtlebot_world.launch] is neither a launch file in package [turtlebot_gazebo] nor is [turtlebot_gazebo] a launch file name
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

After that I installed without deleting the previous turtlebot software:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot-gazebo

Everything was fine and then I tried again and got:
..
