Q:

Problem building rosserial on Ubuntu MATE and ROS Kinetic on Raspberry 3 & Arduino

Hy there,
i am running this image on my Raspberry Pi3 (Ubuntu Mate 16.04 with preinstalled ROS Kinetic Full Desktop Package): http://www.german-robot.com/2016/05/26/raspberry-pi-sd-card-image/
I have troubles building rosserial in ROS Kinetic. I get following errors:
[ 95%] Building CXX object rosserial/rosserial_server/CMakeFiles/rosserial_server_socket_node.dir/src/socket_node.cpp.o
c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-5/README.Bugs> for instructions.

I would be very glad if someone could help me :)
Thanks in advance,

A:

Ah, the internal compiler error. This is either a GCC bug or you just ran out of memory and the oom reaper took GCC from you. Do you have a spare flash drive? If so, you can format it to swap and use it to hopefully get through compilation.
Otherwise, this could actually be a GCC issue for arm. But that's rather unlikely, so please attempt the added swap solution before considering reporting to the GCC folks.
