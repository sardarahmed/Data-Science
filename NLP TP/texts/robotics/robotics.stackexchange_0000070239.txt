Q:

How to create custom models and include that in .world file?

I need to include a small box (static) object in a .world file that has a picture in it. (I have .launch and .world file that works fine) I am new to ros and gazebo. I am little bit confused with all the model files (.dae, .model, .urdf, etc). How can I create a small box shape with a picture in it and how to include that in a .world file? Do I need to create a model in blender or sketchup and export it to .dae? I don't have a clear idea of how .dae, .model, .urdf files works together.

Hi,
one procedure to create custom Gazebo models is the following:

create the dae file of the model. For this there
are several ways. One way is to use
sketchup to find a model of the
object you need, then download it,
adapt it a little bit with blender,
and save it.
Once you have the
proper dae file for your model, you
need to create a series of files
that define the model. You need to
create the model.conf, the model.sdf
and the meshes directory where to
put your dae file.
Then you have
to place those files in the
~/.gazebo/models directory in order
to be able to use it in an sdf
.world file.
Final step is to include the model in your world file

Because all that is a little confusing, we created a video showing how to do all the process. You can find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP4sDyrRzpU
