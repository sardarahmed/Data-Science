Q:

Build android_tutorial_camera

I tried to connect my android phone with ROS according to the following tutorial:
Run a ROS Android example project
http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosjava/Tutorials/Run%20a%20ROS%20Android%20example%20project
More precisely I tried to put the android_tutorial_camera to my phone, but I get at the tutorial http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/android_core/html/building.html allways the error message that Execution failed for task ':android_acm_serial:updateProject'. A problem occurred starting command 'android'.
If I follow the tutorial I get lots of error in the android_gingerbread_mr1 witch is necassary for the android_tutorial_camera. Basically the errors happens because the import of com.google. ... can't be resolved by the compiler.
What can I do to fix this problem and the resolve this library?
I think it's the same problem from the following link:
http://answers.ros.org/question/33511/build-failed-when-build-the-android_core-in-rosjava/
But although I followed the instruction there I wasn't able to compile the tutorials.
Thanks for helping

Adding the following lines to the ~/.bashrc file hepled:
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/android-sdk-linux_x86/tools
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/opt/android-sdk-linux_x86/tools  # Depends on where you install Android Developer Tools
sudo killall java
