And what have you found yourself? A quick google leads me to flir_driver (src: tum-ros-pkg/code/drivers/flir_driver/, which is old, but may be a starting point.

great, but how can we run it as ROS package

A:

We successfully used the flir_gige driver with a A35 camera, so I'd recommend to try that one.

after you downloaded  the driver to laptop, can you please explain to me how did you run this package by typing some commands in the terminal

It's a standard catkin package and gets built like all other ROS packages. The launch files are largely self explanatory. I unfortunately don't have the time to provide detailed instructions.
