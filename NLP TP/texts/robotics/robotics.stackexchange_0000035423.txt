Q:

turtlebot_interactive_markers

Hi,
I'm trying to make the turtlebot_ineractive_markers and I cant. the error I get is:
In file included from /home/albert/ros_diamondback/interactive_markers/src/interactive_marker_server.cpp:32:0:  /home/albert/ros_diamondback/interactive_markers/include/interactive_markers/interactive_marker_server.h:35:56: fatal error: visualization_msgs/InteractiveMarkerUpdate.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated.
Which means that I need to copy the interactive_marker_server.h to /home/albert/ros_diamondback/interactive_markers/include/interactive_markers/
The question is: where do I find this document?
Thanks.

A:

It looks like you are using ROS Diamondback, however Interactive Markers is new in Electric -- you cannot build anything depending on interactive markers in diamondback.
