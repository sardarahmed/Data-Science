Q:

3d: octomap or PCL (pointcloud lib)?

Hi all
I am trying to have the navigation stack running and generate a 3d map; after using octomap, I got something like this:

The robot as if is going through a wall. The 2d map is self correcting itself in realtime, while the 3d map generated by octomap is not; the marker array published by octomap will never be update or erased.
So I am wondering, is PCL an alternative for doing 3d mapping?
Thank you in advance

A:

PCL is a library, so it doesn't have many fully working demos that are very advanced (demos are best kept simple, so the code is understandable). There are several other real 3D slam packages -- for instance CCNY's code (https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/ccny_rgbd_tools) or RGBD_SLAM (a couple others are listed on blog post I made a while back: http://www.showusyoursensors.com/2013/02/3d-mapping-is-here.html).
However --- it appears you are in simulation -- and most of these packages use 2d-like features (things that would probably depend on actual, real texture being in the images received) and will probably not work in Gazebo.
