Q:

Arbitrary Marker in Rviz

Is there any way to put a marker at an arbitrary pose in RViz? What I want to be able to do is put a marker at some xyz in some coordinate frame WITHOUT having to write code. I know I could put a marker there with code
My current method is to create a Grid, which allows you to specify a base frame and offset, but that's hardly efficient.

A:

You can certainly place a marker wherever you like. But, something has to publish it with its position.
What is the requirement for not writing code?
EDIT: To check tf calculations without writing additional code, you can use the TF display in rviz.

Perhaps a simple node that reads a frame_id and point from the keyboard, and publishes a marker there?  Admittedly, it's a bit crufty, but it should accomplish what you want to do.

I just want to be able to check within RViz. Let's say I have a node that does a TF calculation for me, and it prints out the numbers for where a certain point is. I could change the dependencies of my package to publish a marker, OR I could just throw the point in RViz and see if it matches up.
