A:

found some reference benchmarks for reference:

quadro 2000
quadro 600
gtx 650

In addition, from specs on Nvidia site, the memory bandwidth of Quadro 2000 (@41.5 GB/sec) is about half of GTX 650 (@80.0 GB/sec), and Quadro 600 (@25.6 GB/sec) will be about half of Quadro 2000.  Since a lot of the simulation work is getting the images off of these cards, one can probably expect performance to scale accordingly as well.
