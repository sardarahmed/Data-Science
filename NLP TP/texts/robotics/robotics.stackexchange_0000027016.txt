Q:

Accurate bumper simulation

Hi!
I'm trying to simulate a bumper as 'real' as possible. I would like to have the 3D model of the bumper move when it bumps into an object and then measure the position or even have a switch inside the bumper to trigger a message with the bumper information.
Is this possible? Is there a special type of joint that I should use? I want to use ROS, so I can't use the latests Gazebo versions.
Any help is appreciated!

Thank you very much for your answer! I'm having the same problem as Gxav. I get an empty state message.
