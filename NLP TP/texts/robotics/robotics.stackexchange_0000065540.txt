Q:

pointcloud_to_laserscan package not working in ROS indigo

The pointcloud_to_laserscan package is not working properly in ROS Indigo. The Indigo build is done recently and seems to contain some error. As required by the node I have published the pointcloud data from Kinect in PointCloud2 format in /cloud_in topic. But the laserscan data that must be produced and published by Kinect in /scan topic seems erroneous. It returns an array full of 'Inf'. Please fix the error.
My code for publishing in /cloud_in is as follows,
#!/usr/bin/env python
import roslib
import rospy
import geometry_msgs.msg
from sensor_msgs.msg import PointCloud2

def callback(data):
    pub = rospy.Publisher('/cloud_in', PointCloud2,queue_size=10)
    pub.publish(data)

def pcl_2D():
    rospy.init_node('pcl_2D', anonymous=True)
    global listener 
    rospy.Subscriber("/camera/depth/points", PointCloud2, callback)
    rospy.spin()

if __name__=='__main__':
    pcl_2D()

I have attached the rosbag which contains the data in topics /cloud_in /rosout and erroneous /scan. Each topics have 10 msgs published. I have compressed the bag using rosbag compress . Please use rosbag decompress 2015-02-07-02-09-32.bag before starting analyse.

You don't provide enough information to reproduce this problem; which makes it impossible to fix. At the very least, please provide the parameters that you're using for the pointcloud to lasterscan node, and a bag file of the pointcloud and tf data that you're feeding into it.

Posting the same question on ROS Answers and as a bug is considered poor etiquette. If you have a question, please ask it on ROS answers, and only report it as a bug if the answers suggest that it is actually a bug.
