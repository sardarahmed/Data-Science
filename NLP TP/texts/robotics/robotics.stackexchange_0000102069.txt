Q:

Error smach_viewer in ROS noetic

Hi,
I read the smach tutorial and there is no problem until I run smach_viewer command.
Smach tutorial
rosrun smach_viewer smach_viewer.py
The terminal shows the below error :
[rospack] Error: package 'smach_viewer' not found
I checked the /opt/ros/noetic/share path there is no smach_viewer package. just smach.
the question is: What should I do to see the graphical representation of my smach code?
I'm using ubuntu focal, Noetic ROS, and python3.
thanks a lot for your support.

A:

It seems Smach lib is based on Python2 and ROS noetic is not supported by python2. So the lib of the Smach should change to Python3.
