Q:

How to detect obstacle position using point cloud data?

Hi Everyone,
I am working on turtlebot and kinect sensor. I want to detect obstacle presence and its position using kinect sensor. How could I do this and I am not using maps. Just want to know whether obstacle is there or not. And if I am going to use point cloud libraries, how can i get obstacle position(X,Y) .
(I am using Ros kinetic version,Ubuntu 16.04 and python as coding language.)

A:

This is pretty broad and generic. I'd suggest that you look through some of the PCL tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Tutorials
You can also just read the position data out of the point cloud data structure manually.
