Q:

Visualize or plot Float32MultiArray data field

Similar to this question, is there a way to plot the data field of a Float32MultiArray message type? I'm trying to show the FFT of a signal in real-time and I can't seem to find a straightforward method of implementing the visualization I've tried Plot juggler, rqt_plot amd rqt_multiplot and they don't seem to have the functionality

A:

for anyone else who ends up here.....I did a hacky solution to this problem of visualizing uint16 multiarray topics by adding it to the already established graph_rviz_plugin.

it was relatively straight forward, and could be enhanced with the other multi-array types as well IF your use case is similiar to mine where the multi-array was only one dimension, and I wanted to just use the size of the multi-array as the x-axis.

This looks quite good actually. I basically ended up converting my data to an image using opencv and then using an image topic to view it in Rviz. I'll see if I can play around with this and let you know how I get on. My use-case is quite similar. x axis is basically each FFT bin while y axis is the amplitude of each  frequency bin

i dont have a float32multiarray topic to test on but I cleaned up my code a bit and tried adding in the other multiarray types. go ahead and try it out and let me know how it goes. https://github.com/flynneva/graph_rviz_plugin/tree/devel
