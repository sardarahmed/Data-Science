Upgraded DRC Simulator, and now roslaunch UI fails to load for atlas.
Anyone know the cause? - Thanks, Aaron

A:

Sounds like a version mismatch between drcsim and gazebo.  In particular, you probably have drcsim 2.1.x + gazebo 1.5.x, which is an unsupported configuration.
Try an update and explicit install of both, which should get you to drcsim 2.2.x + gazebo 1.5.x:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install drcsim gazebo

The following was the output from the sudo apt-get..  sudo apt-get install drcsim gazebo

drcsim is already the newest version.
gazebo is already the newest version.

I wonder if the installer is failing to install because I don't have an AMD64 for the 64-bit package for the Boston Dynamics addition?
Comment by gerkey on 2013-03-21:
Oh, that would definitely do it.  In that case, apt-get will refuse to upgrade your drcsim to 2.2.0, leaving you with an incompatible version combination.  You should either move to a 64-bit machine or build drcsim 2.2.0 from source.

Having exactly the same problem as this poster - I can't update from drcsim-2.1, and now I have gazebo-1.5 with it and nothing's working.  We run an intel chip, that doesn't seem to be the problem.  What would cause the apt-get update to not detect that 2.2 is available?  My keys seem correct, nothing else has change with my installer lists.

@DRC_Justin: are you running on 32-bit or 64-bit?  Try uname -m.  If it returns x86_64 or amd64, you're on 64-bit.  If it returns something else (probably x86), you're on 32-bit.
Comment by DRC_Justin on 2013-03-21:
@gerkey: We are running 32 bit.  It returned i686.  What should we be running?
