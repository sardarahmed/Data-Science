Q:

Is rviz a good display interface for a simulator

hello all,
I am developing a project in which I need to have a simulator of the robot for the user, so I would like to integrate the simulator display of Rviz in my interface,
is there anyway in ROS in which I can input the commands by commandline for example or which I an manipulate their code to get it inside my gui ?
Thank you

A:

Rviz is a visualizer, if you are looking for a simulator in row, then you should look into gazebo, see the wiki here http://www.ros.org/wiki/simulator_gazebo. OpenRAVE also provides a good simulator and is well documented here with row support available as well.
It would help if you clarify your needs further.
