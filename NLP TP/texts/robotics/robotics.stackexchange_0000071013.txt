Q:

How can I access the bumper sensors on a turtlebot in a simulation?

I've been working on a project, and I need to turn a certain direction when a turtlebot bumps into something. I'm looking for a ROS plugin to use in a simulation in Gazebo. I can't seem to find anything in any turtlebot repositories or on the ROS wiki.
Thank you.

A:

Maybe there is something wrong or broken. I am also having problems to reading bumper events when using kobuki in Gazebo. It's like the kobuki plugin for gazebo is not publishing bumper events.
