Q:

OpenCV4Tegra and ROS - HowTo? (Jetson TK1)

Hi all,
I'm trying to "force" ROS to see OpenCV4Tegra as the official OpenCV installed on my Jetson TK1 so that cv_bridge does not install libopencv-dev from Ubuntu repo.
I tried to follow the guide posted here
https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/779315/jetson-tk1-opencv-and-ros/
but as you can see I faced a problem that I could not solve until now.
Does anyone succeeded on it?
OpenCV4Tegra has GPU support and it is optimized for Tegra TK1 SoC, so I want to use its power for my algorithms ;)

which L4T version are you on?
Comment by Myzhar on 2015-02-10:
@l0g1x I'm using the latest 21.2.2 hacked with TheGrinch kernel

I forgot where I read this, but that dummy package works as is for 19.3, and that you have to slightly modify the dummy package for it to work with 21.2 opencv4tegra.

I tried every kind of modifications, but I cannot figure out what I was missing, I'm really curious.
As long as I get the solution I will post it on my guide to configure Jetson TK1 for a robotics application:
