Q:

move_base footprint

Hello,
I have a problem with the move_base package. It keeps saying those kind of things :
[ WARN] [1402905398.913790779]: Control loop missed its desired rate of 3.0000Hz... the loop actually took 0.5543 seconds

And after the first time an error is prited. Meaning I run it once, it gets a lots of warning and the robot just go crazy and then I have this error the second time, along with the above warning :
[ERROR] [1402905389.655349880]: You must specify at least three points for the robot footprint, reverting to previous footprint.

The thing is I'm not using the footprint since I defined a radius. Here is the costmap_common_params.yaml file :
obstacle_range: 2.5
raytrace_range: 3.0
robot_radius: 0.285
inflation_radius: 0.3
max_obstacle_height: 1
min_obstacle_height: 0.0
observation_sources: scan
scan: {data_type: LaserScan, topic: /scan, marking: true, clearing: true}

So I don't have any footprint but it's normal. THe same exact file work flawlessly on Groovy, the problem is on hydro.
It follow exactly the same scheme as here without being fatal but I though it has been corrected.
Here I ask the robot to go more or less forward...

I really don't know what is wrong there. Any help will be greatly appreciated ! Thanks

A:

OK nevermind. Something was fishy in the costmap parameters files and I still don't know what. But I use something rather drastic and I re-wrote all of them as simpler versions (less parameters, closer to the explanation on the move_base page) and now it's working fine. I have no idea what happen but I probably defined something weird somewhere.
Sorry for all the fuzz about it.
