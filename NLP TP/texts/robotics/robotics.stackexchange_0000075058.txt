Q:

How to build two packages at the same time

I use ros jade and want to run ar_sys package. However, this is not available for jade version. So i get it from github. In case to work, the ar_sys needs the uvc_cam package. Every time i do make and build only the ar_sys package responds. What should I do to do make and build athe same time?
Thanks

Is uvc_cam listed as a dependency in the ar_sys CMakeLists.txt file?
Unless it is explicitly listed as dependency, then CMake won't know to build it first.

A:

You should try to
1- Download uvc_cam package from git in your catkin workspace
2- Download ar_sys package from git in your catkin workspace
3- Do catkin_make --pkg uvc_cam so it will compile the uvc_cam package first
4- Do catkin_make so it will compile all your catkin workspace while satisfying the dependencies
