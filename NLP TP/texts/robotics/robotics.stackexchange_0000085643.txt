Q:

Height Map xyz coordinates

Hello,
I'm using velodyne height map , so far i am struggling to only view the x,y,z coordinates of obstacles. even once I try to edit on  heightmap.cpp file nothing changing in output. what could be best way to as to only view the coordinates without the raw data matrix.
if anyone can clarify to me what is meant by offset
for instance
this means that the value of the x is on zero position  in the raw data matrix.
  seq: 22
  stamp: 
    secs: 1518471618
    nsecs: 669806000
  frame_id: velodyne
height: 1
width: 480
fields: 
  - 
    name: x
    offset: 0
    datatype: 7
    count: 1
  - 
    name: y
    offset: 4
    datatype: 7
    count: 1
  - 
    name: z
    offset: 8
    datatype: 7
    count: 1
  - 
    name: intensity
    offset: 16
    datatype: 7
    count: 1
is_bigendian: False
point_step: 32
row_step: 15360

thank you

A:

You can use the PointCloud Library to unpack the data from those messages.

yea, that's what I am trying to do.I am new using ROS. so even when I try to update the .cpp file nothing changes in the output. or is there such a way to unpack the point cloud using terminal commands.
thank you

That link tells you how to do that in C++ code. There are also many tutorials.

Yes, it just needs x, y, z
