Q:

How should I define the camera frames in my robot's URDF?

Hi,
I have a URDF model for my robot and two cameras mounted on the robot's head (a Bumblebee and an Asus Xtion). My question is, how do I define the camera link frames and the frames for each of the cameras? Do I estimate the location of each, e.g. in solidworks?
Any help would be really appreciated!
Thanks

A:

Yes, you have to estimate the location and orientation of your camera with respect to the parent link that the camera is attached to.
In this tutorial, you can see a robot example and how the cameras are defined and also how the "origin" of each camera is implemented in this XACRO file.
