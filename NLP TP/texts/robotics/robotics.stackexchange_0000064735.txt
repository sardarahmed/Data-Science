Q:

Moveit: Link collides with itself

Upon spawning the robotiq gripper palm found here https://github.com/ros-industrial/robotiq/blob/groovy-devel/robotiq_s_model_visualization/cfg/s-model_articulated_macro.xacro
Even after removing the fingers, the palm has a red collision with itself (Rviz says so, and when used with a full arm model it refuses to plan in MoveIt!)
Could it be because of this stl file? Do visual tags collide with collision tags? Any insight would be appreciated here.

A:

I have no idea why, but this was fixed by re-downloading the URDF model from the repo. This was one of the stranger bugs..
