Q:

Unable to extract images from *.bag

I am following this tutorial wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Tutorials/Exporting%20image%20and%20video%20data ,but
"rosmake image_view --rosdep-install"            gives an error
"rosmake: error: no such option: --rosdep-install".
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

A:

If you installed ros-hydro-desktop-full by
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-desktop-full

as stated in
http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu
image_view typically comes along with the installation and does not have to be installed as separate package. Just continue with what is following in the tutorial....

Proceeding further,  "roslaunch export.launch"    gives the error

This tutorial requires that you have previously recorded a bag file which contains image data you would like to export as jpeg images or video.

Record a rosbag with an image stream and change args of the rosbag node in launch according to where your bag file is placed. Futhermore the remap tag of image_view node has to be set to the image topic you have recorded into your rosbag

You can try this one. I am not sure whether image_view can handle compressed images, though. Maybe also try to record image_raw of your camera....
