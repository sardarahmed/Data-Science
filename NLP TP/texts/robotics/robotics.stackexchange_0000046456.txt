Q:

[groovy beta 2] Question regarding catkin, location of binaries and roslaunch

Hello,
I am migrating code and I have a question regarding catkin. With rosmake the binaries where created in the /mypackage/bin folder, now catkins (using catkin_make) creates them in /mypackage/build/devel/lib/package. The, probably foolish, question is how to execute these binaries. When I try "rosrun mypackage" and autocompletion with tab, the new binaries are not shown. Besides, I used a launch file, which also doesn't work because it looks like the binaries are expected in mypackage/bin. Am I missing something?
Cheers,
Oier

A:

You can do:
catkin_make install

This will make an install directory with your binaries, libraries, messages, setup.bash, etc that are all in one easy place. Then do:
source /path_to_package/package/install/setup.bash

This will make everything available to rosrun.
