Q:

How to just run simple commands like teleop between PC and Workstation

I set up the environment and it satisfies these requirements:
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/hydro/Network%20Configuration
What do I do to allow the basic commands like
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

to work from my Workstation.
Also, are version fo ROS backward compatible?
The turtlebot PC is running an older release, hydro, and I installed jade on my workstation.

A:

Try setting the  ROS_MASTER_URI to the ip of your robot: export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<robot_ip>:11311/ without <>. Then you can try to run rostopic list and see if you get the topics from your turtlebot. If that works, start the launch file in that terminal.
In general you should use the same ROS version everywhere but if you only use standard messages and their definition did not change, it should still work. But do make sure you install the same ROS version eventually.
