Q:

What is ament_python?

I was trying to create some documentation for ament_python. But I don't even know where to start. It does not seem to be a package. There is no entry in https://index.ros.org/search/?term=ament_python&section=pkgs. There is this abandoned repo: https://github.com/ament/ament_python But it must be defined somewhere, because it can be defined as build_type, right?

I found some entries for ament_python in the ROS2 GitHub: https://github.com/ament/ament_package, https://github.com/ament/ament_package/blob/rolling/package.xml, did you check it?

Yes, I found those too. But I think this is not relevant since ament is not used as build tool anymore.

I think I found it: https://github.com/colcon/colcon-ros/blob/master/colcon_ros/task/ament_python/build.py
