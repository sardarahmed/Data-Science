A:

From your screenshot:

$ catkin init

catkin: command not found

The catkin command is provided by catkin_tools, which is not installed by default in a ros-$distro-* install (desktop or desktop-full fi). The default would be catkin_init_workspace.
Note that I don't know which version (catkin_tools or plain Catkin) is recommended in the Ariac documentation.
