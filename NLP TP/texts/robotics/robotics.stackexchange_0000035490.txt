A:

Take a look at the following documentation pages:

rosbag can record and play ROS topics. This is the best way to record data if you want to emulate the live system behavior and/or avoid extra code to deal with file I/O.
You can also read and write point clouds from/to PCD files.

bag_to_pcd is exactly what i'm looking for, thanks!

"rosbag play" publishes the recorded ROS topic, so you can visualize it pretty much the same way as if the data were live. There is also a tool bag_to_pcd in the pcl_ros package. It's your choice.

looks great, thank you!
is it possible to convert a bag file into a pcd file for viewing of the point cloud?
or will rosbag play take care of that?
