A:

You're using a deprecated ROS version (electric) on a version of ubuntu that is no longer supported (11.10) with a camera package that isn't released anymore (openni_kinect) and a camera whose chipset maker got bought by apple and so will likely stop getting sold at some point (xtion).
If you switch to ROS indigo on ubuntu 14.04 and use openni2_camera to read from the camera, you'll have a much better chance of finding people who know how to answer your questions.

Thanks.
I have a robot QBO and his OpenQbo Distro is the Linux distro based only on Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) ROS electric.
What should I do in this situation?
