Q:

At creating a ROS package by hand

In tutorials, creating a ROS package by hand
To see one example of why specifying these dependencies is useful, try executing the following commands rospack commands:
rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags foobar
rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=lflags foobar
what is the "--attrib" , "cflags" and "lflags"?

A:

In manifest files of packages that export libraries, you can see something like this (taken from roscpp's maifest file):
<export>
  <cpp cflags="-I${prefix}/include `rosboost-cfg --cflags`" lflags="-Wl,-rpath,${prefix}/lib -L${prefix}/lib -lros `rosboost-cfg --lflags thr
</export>

With rospack export --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags roscpp you'll get the value of the attribute cflags as specified in roscpp's manifest.xml. cflags exports are used by CMake to build up all compiler flags for building a package, lflags are used for linker flags respectively.
