Q:

launch file for another machine

I am trying to do a single master. My ssh password-less is working just by typing as follow: ssh huey@10.42.0.3
IP of A is 10.42.0.2
master is A
IP of B is 10.42.0.3
<launch>

<machine 
    name = "robot" 
    address = "huey@10.42.0.3" 
    env-loader = "/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh"></machine>
<node
    pkg ="turtlesim" 
    type = "turtlesim_node"
    name="turtlesim"
    machine = "robot"></node>

</launch>

but i got this error
cannot resolve host address for machine [huey@10.42.0.3]
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

Thanks

A:

Try adding the user and address separately:
<machine 
name = "robot" 
address = "10.42.0.3" 
user = "huey"
env-loader = "/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh"></machine>

Hi chrissi, It gives other issue after this.
remote[10.42.0.3-0]: failed to launch on master:
10.42.0.3 is not in your SSH known_hosts file.
Please manually:
ssh huey@10.42.0.3
then try roslaunching again.

This should solve that issue: http://answers.ros.org/question/41446/a-is-not-in-your-ssh-known_hosts-file/

Chrissi I almost got it to work. Based on the link you have me, this is what i put in the terminal:
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms='ssh-rsa' 10.42.0.3

But there is new error:
[10.42.0.3-0]: [turtlesim-1] process has died [pid 2638, exit code 1, cmd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/turtlesim`/turtlesim_node `__name:=turtlesim __log:=/home/huey/.ros/log/e75e45ec-a500-11e5-9a9d-f4b7e29bc4b5/turtlesim-1.log].`

when i do the roslaunch on my master laptop.
Comment by Chrissi on 2015-12-18:
Can you run the turtlesim on the other machine without the ssh setup? Also, turtlesim does need a graphical user interface. I don't think that X forwarding will mwork like that. Try DISPLAY=:0 roslaunch ... which might then start the GUI on the remote machine instead of trying to forward it.
Comment by Chrissi on 2015-12-18:
Never tried this though. If this doesn't work, start the turtlesim on the local machine.
Comment by Chrissi on 2015-12-18:
No, this won't work... I don't think you can start nodes that require X remotely using a launch file but I might be mistaken.
Comment by Vinh K on 2015-12-18:
i see. I will just do a basic talker listener from ROS tutorial rather than turtlesim.
Comment by Vinh K on 2015-12-18:
you are right turtlesim does not work work remotely.

Here is the new roslaunch;
<launch>

<machine 
    name = "slave"
    address = "10.42.0.3"
    user = "huey"
    env-loader = "/opt/ros/indigo/env.sh"></machine>

<node
    pkg ="talker" 
    type = "talker"
    name="talker"
    machine = "slave"</node>
</launch>

i get this error now:
[10.42.0.3-0]: ERROR: cannot launch node of type [talker/talker.cpp]: talker
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/indigo/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/indigo/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

i am almost there Chrissi
