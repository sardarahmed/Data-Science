Q:

Error while sourcing slam_gmapping in ROS Melodic

I have got the slam_gmapping package from https://github.com/OpenSLAM-org/openslam_gmapping.git
Now when I try to source the workspace in ROS Melodic, I get the following output, which is throwing an error:
shaunak@robokits:~/catkin_ws$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
slam_gmapping: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [openslam_gmapping]
gmapping: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [openslam_gmapping]

I also tried https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git, but came to know that it is built till ROS Hydro only.
Am I facing this issue due to my latest ROS Melodic Version? Is there any slam_gmapping source available for ROS Melodic? If yes, kindly share it.

Edit: @gvdhoorn : Thank you for sharing #q300480. I have not used docker yet. In fact, it's a new term for me. I was about to execute the following commands:
$ docker run -it --rm ros:melodic
(docker) $ apt update
(docker) $ rosdep update
(docker) $ mkdir -p /ros_ws/src
(docker) $ cd /ros_ws
(docker) $ git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/openslam_gmapping src/openslam_gmapping
(docker) $ git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping src/slam_gmapping
(docker) $ rosdep install --from-paths src/ -i
(docker) $ catkin_make

But I had to sudo  the docker run -it --rm ros:melodic  command and it ended like this:
shaunak@robokits:~$ sudo docker run -it --rm ros:melodic
root@583c78ce75be:/# 

instead of
$ docker run -it --rm ros:melodic
(docker) $ 

Please confirm whether I should proceed further or not.
I also want to know, if I can work in root@583c78ce75be:/# ,  whether I can use my already existing workspace instead of creating a new one as per here. If I can not, then I can not work on my existing workspace that has many other packages as well. So kindly clarify it because as per my understanding, I find no point in setting up two different workspaces having separate sections of my packages.

Please do not post answers if you're not answering your own question. This is not a forum and AskBot works a bit differently.

Ok. I had to respond with long text and the comment section has limit, so I chose to answer. Anyways, point noted.

A:

Please see #q300480.
Note also btw: "sourcing a package" is not vernacular that is used in ROS. Only workspaces can be sourced.
Also: the upstream openslam_gmapping repository that you found is not a ROS package, so you cannot use it directly.

Edit:

I have not used docker yet. In fact, it's a new term for me.

there is no need to use Docker.
I just used it in #q300480 to test out whether I could build gmapping from source without polluting my own system.
You can just run the two git clone .. commands and the rosdep install .. command in and on your regular workspace.

It works as per #q300480. A very small difference between docker and my user was that I had to shaunak@robokits:~$ mkdir -p ~/ros_catkin_ws/src in terminal instead of (docker) $ mkdir -p /ros_ws/src in docker because shaunak@robokits:~$ mkdir -p /ros_catkin_ws/src created folder in root.
