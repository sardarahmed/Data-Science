Q:

Can nodes be made to automatically restart on segmentation faults?

Is there a convenient way to tell roslaunch to automatically restart nodes if/when they segfault or otherwise die.
I realize that in an ideal world, I'd just fix the errors properly. However, parts of the code aren't mine and I'll be using them in a live demo. So I'd prefer to have them run in a 'best effort' mode. :)
One obvious option would be to launch the buggy nodes using a bash script:
while : ; do rosrun package node; done

but I was wondering if there was a more idiomatic ROS style?
Thanks.

A:

roslaunch provides the respawn attribute. E.g.:
<roslaunch>
  <node name="foo" pkg="package" type="node" respawn="true" />
</roslaunch>

Check out the documentation here.

Yes respawn will to the job. But may the questioner shut more be concerned about the segmentation fault and its causes, rather then just search for a work around. By the way, the most common cause of segfault is bad memory handling and faulty assumptions about availability of resources.

Thanks Lorenz.. that's exactly what I was looking for. I feel a bit silly now for not having noticed it in the documentation.
