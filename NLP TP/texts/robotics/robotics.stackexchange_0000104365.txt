Q:

can not mirror the nav2_bringup package

I want to make some modifications to the nav2_bringup package. Therefore, I just copied the nav2_bringup package put it in the workspace and ran the Turtlebot 3 simulator. The following error occurred. Without copies, no errors, all work fine.
https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_bringup/README.md
[ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): cannot import  name 'PushROSNamespace' from 'launch_ros.actions' (/opt/ros/humble/lib/python3.10/site-  packages/launch_ros/actions/__init__.py)

A:

Pull your config file from the humble branch, not the main branch (which targets Rolling). Your issue is API updates made to more recent distributions are not in Humble. Mirror from the humble branch instead.
