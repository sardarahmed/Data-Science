Q:

Is there a shell command to get ros distro?

Is there something I can run in the shell to get something like: "ros-kinetic" or "ros-lunar", depends on what distro I have? "

A:

A quick Google search gives me #q33769. The more recent of the two answers there show that if you want to see which distro is in use (Indigo and later), run
rosversion -d

otherwise run
rosversion ros

to see the version for pre-Indigo (for me this command returns <unversioned>, I'm using Indigo).

Edit:
as @gvdhoorn pointed out in the comments

Additionally, after sourceing the right setup.bash, the ROS_DISTRO environment variable should be set.

Which means that you can get the ROS distribution with
echo $ROS_DISTRO

as well

That's recursive ;)

Indeed, probably from the wrong tab instead of #q33769

@130s and @tfoote good catch. Missed that.

rosversion -d is what I am looking for
