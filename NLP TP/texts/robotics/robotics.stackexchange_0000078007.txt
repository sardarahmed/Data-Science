A:

If you are using a depth camera then the PCL library would be appropriate, but if it is a regular color camera then you would want to use OpenCV, and could try out colored blob detection like in https://www.learnopencv.com/blob-detection-using-opencv-python-c/ (it mentions the blobcolor doesn't work as of that blog post, but I see in http://answers.opencv.org/question/26295/simpleblobdetection-set-blobcolor-python/ that it was fixed which may be available in your version).  Or try out inRange to get a binary image of just the places in the image that are red ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26218280/thresholding-rgb-image-in-opencv ) and do some other operations to your object.
You should use http://answers.opencv.org for OpenCV specific questions.
If there is a single topic with a name that ends in image_raw or image_color then that might be the topic to subscribe to- use rqt_image_view to select from available image topics and find the right one if there are several options.
