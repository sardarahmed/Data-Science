Q:

Controlling a robot through a game steering wheel

I'm using the joy_node of the joy package to control a robot car in V-REP. Now I want to control the robot with a game steering wheel. Is there any package in ROS for this? Otherwise, how do I do this? I already have some knowledge of ROS and V-REP, but I do not know how to read the data sent by the steering wheel driver. I want to use a force feedback steering wheel and a set of pedals. I'm using ROS kinetic and ubuntu 16.04.

This might be an obvious question, but have you tried using the joy node with the steering wheel? I though they all used the same standard interface?

This is another problem. I still do not have the steering wheel. I would like to receive some tip from some steering wheel that is compatible with some existing ROS package and that accepts force feedback

A:

It doesn't look (as far as I can see) there are any ros nodes dedicated to steering wheels. This Reddit thread has a good discussion on linux compatible ones and links to some git repos. You may have to dive in and make your own node for this.
