Q:

beginner's questoin: How to Compile ROS PKG?

Hi all
I have followed all the beginner's tutorial from ROS webpage. I still have trouble understanding the precise procedure of compiling a pkg, obtained from a website.
In my particular interest is : https://github.com/segwayrmp/segway-rmp-ros-pkg,
after download it. I did:
1.Rosmake [package_name]
2.Roscd to [package_name]
3.make
Are these the correct steps in compiling packages like this?
why Makefile is missing from the top level of the package?
Thank you

A:

There are two build systems in ROS: rosbuild - the original one and catkin- the newer one. The package you are referring to uses catkin.
Instructions for compiling catkin packages can also be found in the tutorials. There should be a button at the top in the tutorials where you can switch between rosbuild and catkin.

ok. I see. I was told to use rosbuild, not catkin.  Thank you, I now go and explore the catkin version. But
as for the rosbuild version, do you agree with the steps I took?
Comment by dornhege on 2013-05-24:
rosmake package_name is sufficient. You can also still use rosbuild with your own code and depend on the catkin packages. Just for building a catkin package catkin is required.
