Q:

How can I use iSAM in ROS

Hi,
I plan to apply iSAM algorithm for location by using an AMP2.5 with a GPS connected. Hence the inputs are angular velocities and linear accelerates from IMU, and positions from GPS.
However, I do not know how to include the GTSAM package in my ROS code, neither do I know how to compile and execute.
Could anyone give me some hints? Many thanks.

A:

HI,
In my case, I included iSAM library in my ROS package.
I created a new package, with catkin_creat_package, and add the following lines to the CMake file
add_executable(my_node src/my_node.cpp   )
target_link_libraries(my_node ${catkin_LIBRARIES} isam cholmod)
add_dependencies(my_node my_package)

I installed iSAM library on /usr/include.
