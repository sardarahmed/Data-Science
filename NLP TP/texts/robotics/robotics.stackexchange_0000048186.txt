using openni.launch so tried the killallXnSensorServer cmd. it worked. thank you.

A:

Try typing this command in the same terminal where you get this error killall XnSensorServer. then try launching the node again. If the process dies again, ctrl+c and then type the killall command again (it should say no processes found). Then try launching the node again.

I had the same nodelet-manager dying error and this worked straight away for me. Thanks. It would be helpful for me if you also pointed me to why this worked.

I'm glad it worked for you. I am not exactly sure why it works. It just does :)

Like @ayush_dewan said about memory allocation. When you don't shut down properly, then you have multiple processes trynna access the camera...hence it crashes.

You can reproduce the error by launch and shutting down over and over, till you notice that the Depth camera light is still on, even if you've shut down your openni nodes/nodeleds
