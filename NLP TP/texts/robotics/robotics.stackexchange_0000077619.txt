Q:

Problems with .rosinstall when calling wstool merge

Using Linux 14.04, ROS Indigo.
I am familiar with wstool. Just expanded my repository to better organize code: https://www.github.com/birlrobotics
Trying to do the traditional steps:

wstool init
wstool merge [address]
wstool update

Now, when I try westool merge with the following file:
wstool merge https://github.com/birlrobotics/birl_baxter/blob/master/birl_baxter.rosinstall
I get the following error:
ERROR in config: Invalid multiproject
yaml format in
[https://github.com/birlrobotics/birl_baxter/blob/master/birl_baxter.rosinstall]:
mapping values are not allowed here  
in "<file>", line 7, column 19

A few points here:

It does not seem that the line 7, column 19 points to anything I can figure out.
I have tried going over this file multiple times trying to figure out if there are any small mistakes and I can't find anything.
If I just copy the contents of the file into a local birl_baxter.rosinstall file and then call wstool update IT WORKS. The output below is obtained with wstool info if I copy the contents manually:

Does anyone have an insight into this?

A:

You are fetching the HTML page, not the raw .rosinstall file.
Use the following URL and it should work fine: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birlrobotics/birl_baxter/master/birl_baxter.rosinstall
You get this by clicking the RAW button at the top of the file on github.
If you use wget PATH you can see what you have as input to wstool
