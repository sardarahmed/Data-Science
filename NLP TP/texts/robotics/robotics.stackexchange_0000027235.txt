Q:

GetAngle of revolute2 returns always 0

Hi,
I'm using gazebo 2.2.5, because it ships with Ubuntu. However, for my revolute2 joints I can't get the angular position of the 2nd axis: joint->GetAngle(1) returns always 0.
GetVelocity(1) as well as GetAngle(0) and GetVelocity(0) work as expected.
I found in this forum that this bug should have been fixed in Gazebo 1.4 here - but apparently it's not.
I would like to know if this is a bug, and if it is fixed in later versions? I would prefer to stay with the gazebosim that comes with ubuntu, unless there is a really good reason to upgrade and resign the convenience that prepacked versions offer...

A:

Gazebo currently does not ship with Ubuntu. You have probably installed ROS, which brings in Gazebo2.
The issue that you have referred to is related to your question, but addresses a different problem.
Access to the angle of the second axis of a revolute2 joint has not been available in ODE. We have an outstanding issue to fix this.

Thanks. I have a workaround: I just connect multiple 1DOF revolute joints via massless links.
