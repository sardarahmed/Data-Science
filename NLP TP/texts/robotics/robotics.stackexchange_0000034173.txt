Q:

Gyro substitute for turtlebot

Hi,
The suggested gyro for turtlebot is no longer available at Sparkfun.com. Does someone knows which other gyro can be used?
Thanks in advance,
Lucas

A:

if you're looking for a breakout board that will also work you can use http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8372 , it's not a drop in replacement but if you're looking for a breakout board this will work

all you need is a 5V gyro.. it doesn't really matter how many axis and it should be somewhere between 150-300deg/sec

For those willing to pay a high price for the adxrs613 breakout box there are still a few in stock at http://www.active-robots.com/sensors/gyros/gyro-breakout-board-adxrs613.html

I think that $ 60 is very expensive for a single axis gyro breakout board... Is possible to use a dual or triple axis gyro? Because Sparkfun has other cheaper options: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10100

either will work, with the 300deg/s gyro you will need to claibrate you TurtleBot the default values will not be close enough. the board you suggest above would be a better choice because the default calibration values will be close and you might not need to calibrate.

Would the e2 version of above, http://www.active-robots.com/sensors/gyros/gyro-breakout-board-mlx90609-e2.html , be an even better alternative, as it is also 150/s and has imilar sensitivity to the adxrs613?
Comment by Marco on 2011-09-13:
Besides the sensitivity being twice as low and the max speed twice as high, it seems similar to ad adxrs613. What kind of changes (software/hardware) are needed in order for this gyro to function correctly in the turtlebot package?
