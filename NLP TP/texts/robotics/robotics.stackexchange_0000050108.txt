Q:

How to turn irobot create by exact angle using brown package?

I am trying to get an iRobot Create to turn by 90 degrees. I am using the irobot_create_2_1 driver. I am trying to subscribe to \odom topic to read the orientation but am not sure exactly which parameter gives the current angle. I know Create provides an opcode for wait_angle (opcode 157). Can I use this for turning using the brown driver?

tryin to connect irobot using bam bluetooth module, but it returns "bad data" and "OSError: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable" on driver.py....plz help

A:

One way to do this, is to determine the heading between odom and base_link which is published by the driver. An example of this can be found here in albany-ros-pkg seminar2011/square_with_tf.py. This was an example piece of code we used to draw squares on the ground with that same driver, although it was last run 2 years ago so something might have changed in the driver or ROS since then.

Thanks so much for your reply. I tried using that code. However it does not make a perfect square, it overshoots the angle by quite a large amount. Are there any values I would need to tweak in the code?

It may be something very obvious but since I have never used python before, I am finding it difficult to understand. Thanks

The turning odometry on the create is pretty bad... honestly, +/- 20 degrees on a 90 degree angle is probably the best you can expect.
