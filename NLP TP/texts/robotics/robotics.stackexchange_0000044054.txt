Q:

publish only some topics of a rosbag file (Command line or launch file)

Hi!
I am using rosbag play in  a launch file, and one of the recorded topics is processed data from the other topics. As I want to produce again, I would like to play all topics except that one.
I know I should have given it an anonymous name or I can play it in a namespace. But I would like just not to have that topic playing.
Thanks!
Cristian

A:

Another option would be to create another bag file without the unwanted topic using 'rosbag filter'
