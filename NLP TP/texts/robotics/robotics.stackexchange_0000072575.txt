Q:

CMake error in hector_navigation or navigation

Hi! I'm using a RPi2 with Ubuntu and ROS Indigo (desktop). I am trying to install hector_navigation:
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_navigation.git
catkin_make

but at this point I get this error message:
CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pcl_conversions"
with any of the following names:

pcl_conversionsConfig.cmake
pcl_conversions-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "pcl_conversions" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
set "pcl_conversions_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
If "pcl_conversions" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
sure it has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
hector_navigation/hector_costmap/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
See also "/home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log".
Invoking "cmake" failed

I had got the same problem too by installing navigation from https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git.
How do I fix? Thank you!

A:

This error says that the package pcl_conversions is missing.
Install it by hand or use the very useful rosdep tool. (Not sure if it works on a RPi)

Thank you! I have just one more question for you: with "install it by hand" do you mean always doing from "github.com..."?
Comment by BennyRe on 2016-03-07:
No. You should only install a package from source (from github.com...) if you have reasons to do it. If you just want to use the package then installing it via sudo apt-get install ... should be preferred.

Hi! I tried doing "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pcl-conversions" but I get "Enable to locate packages...". How can I do?
