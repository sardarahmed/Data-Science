Q:

How to fix [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Hi all,
I am trying to run the following launch file: hector_neato.launch
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
  <node pkg="xv_11_laser_driver" type="neato_laser_publisher" name="xv_11_node">
    <!--<param name="port" value="/dev/tty.usbserial-A9UXLBBR"/>-->
    <param name="port" value="/dev/ttyUSB0"/>
    <param name="firmware_version" value="2"/>
    <param name="frame_id" value="laser"/>
  </node>
  <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="base_frame_2_laser" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 /base_frame /laser 100"/> 
  <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz" args="-d rviz_cfg.rviz"/>
  <include file="default_mapping.launch"/> 
  <include file="$(find hector_geotiff)/launch/geotiff_mapper.launch"/>
</launch>

When I run it it gives me the following error
while processing default_mapping.launch: Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'default_mapping.launch' The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

This doesn't make sense because the file that it's complaining about is in the same directory as hector_neato.launch which is
/opt/ros/indigo/share/hector_slam_launch/launch

Please help.

Edit: Never mind I fixed it. I just got rid of the include and copy and pasted default_mapping.launch into hector_neato.launch.

A:

I figured it out. I was missing the "/launch/" in the path. Don't know why I didn't see it.
Also the two launch files hector_neator.launch and default_mapping.launch came from this project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSlkjY-78SQ (see comments section)
Thank you all for your help.
