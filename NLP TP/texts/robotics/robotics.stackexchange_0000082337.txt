A:

This is really not a question, but a dump of the text on the console after running catkin_make. We're all happy to help here, but please spend some more time on properly formulating a question next time. Please see the wiki/Support - Guidelines for asking a question.

As to your problem: CMake can't seem to find your C compiler. Do you have one installed? If you're using Ubuntu, make sure to install the build-essential package. That should sort things out.
