Q:

‘TopicQuery’ is not a member of ‘rosbag’

Hi all!
When I try to build my package via rosmake I get an error
error: ‘TopicQuery’ is not a member of ‘rosbag’

The line that generates an error:
rosbag::View view(bag, rosbag::TopicQuery(topics));

The bag file and topics are initialized as follows:
rosbag::Bag bag;
bag.open("test.bag", rosbag::bagmode::Read);
std::vector<std::string> topics;
topics.push_back(std::string("chatter"));
topics.push_back(std::string("numbers"));

I am new to ROS, so maybe someone could suggest what seems to be the problem?
P.S. I followed this tutorial

Please paste your entire program (or the smallest snippet that reproduces the problem).

A:

I realized that I just forgot the
#include "rosbag/view.h"

So now it works, sorry for inconvenience.
I don't have enough karma to close my own question, so please feel free to do it.

I'll vote you up instead; after all, this is the right answer (no matter who found it).
