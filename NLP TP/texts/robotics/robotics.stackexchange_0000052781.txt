Q:

Steps to create my own robot

Hi All,
I am a beginner user with ROS and I read some tutorials about it and I finished all the beginner level and I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and ROS Groovy.
My question is: I need the software steps (step by step) of how to build my own robot using ROS? as till now I am NOT knowing how to start to build my own robot, I do not mean how to create robot at general?, I mean What should I learn first in ROS then second then third ...... to create my own designed robot at the final
Thank you
