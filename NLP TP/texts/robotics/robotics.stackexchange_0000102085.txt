Q:

ros::ok() and ros::isShutingDown() and thread

I used ros::ok and ros::isShuttingDown inside a thread to find out if the user closed roscore in the terminal by pressing Cnrl+C. However, when I do that, the values of those to function do not change, and threads keep running.
for more detail please see the question on StackOverflow:
