Q:

Part of my Robot gets embedded inside the ground for ROS and Gazebo

While Spawning my URDF in ROS and Gazebo half of my Bipedal Robot gets embedded inside the ground. I know it has to do with the way my URDF tree is structured, but I cant figure out a way to tell ROS or Gazebo that my foot link should be in contact with the floor. Please any clue or help would be useful. Thanks

Can you please provide a link to your URDF?

Here is the link to my urdf file.

did you export the model from somewhere?
Comment by ezeob002 on 2016-01-27:
Nope I made the model using Solidworks, exported the model with simmechanics and made some modifications before trying to spawn in Gazebo and ROS.

A:

Coordinate system origin of your model may not be the bottom-most point. Therefore, if you define it as your base link, it will be snapped to ground. On Solidworks, you can define a coordinate system at the ground level of your model, and while exporting URDF you can select that coordinates as your reference frame.

I have a reference plane in my assembly, how do you set the reference plane as your coordinates reference frame while exporting through simmechanics. Thanks

Check if the global origin is on the plane that is intersecting the model
