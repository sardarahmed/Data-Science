Q:

rosserial_xbee Unable to sync with device

I have been trying to connect to an arduino via rosserial_xbee using xbee s1 and I am receiving this error:
Unable to sync with device; possible link problem or link software version mismatch such as hydro rosserial_python with groovy Arduino

I have seen similar posts in this forum but suggested solutions have not worked for me.
These tutorials work for me:
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Hello%20World
I can reproduce the error following these steps:
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_xbee/Tutorials/Example%20Network
I have also tried various branches of rosserial such as the indigo branch etc.
Rosserial works via usb and I have tested that the xbees work not using rosserial.
System:
Ubuntu 14.04,
Arduino IDE 1.6.5,
ROS Indigo.
Hardware:
Arduino Uno,
XBee S1 (x2),
XBee explorer,
XBee shield.

Does it have to be the Spark Fun Xbee shield? I'm using the Seeed Studio one. Has anyone had success with that shield?
I've now done a fresh install of Ubuntu, Ros and Arduino. Followed the tutorials to the letter. Still same result. So wondering if it's a hardware issue.

Would also be interested to know what versions of ROS and Arduino people are using for this to work.

Just tried it with the SparkFun Xbee shield, still not working for me.

One point of difference is that I am not using the pro version xbee as shown in the link. I wouldn't have thought that would be the issue. I don't want to buy 2 of those just to find out it's not. Anyone got this to work on non pro s1 xbee?

Hello K1B3,
I am facing exact same problem and I am using same ROS version and Ubantu as you. Here is the problem I reported.

Please help me understand what you did to solve this issue.
Appreciate it.
Thanks.

A:

I had the same problems with my Arduino and my Mbed. They mostly seem to arise out of "Arduino/Mbed Hardware.h" and the pins used to communicate with the Xbee.
Which pins does your shield use to communicate with the Arduino?
As far as I know the default config for the sparkfun sheild uses the software serial port, maybe if you switch it to use UART TX,RX you may have better luck.

stormswordx my friend - you are the man!!!
Sorry for the slow response, I was working on something else and only just had a chance to test.
Many thanks!
