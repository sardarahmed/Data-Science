Q:

When should I need --clock parameter on rosbag play?

I can't find any doc about parameter of rosbag play.
In rosbag video told that parameter.
How to use --clock parameter?
Thank you~

A:

If you run "rosbag play --clock ..." before your other nodes, it will set use_sim_time for you. If you prefer to launch the other nodes first, be sure to set it yourself, as @michikarg recommends.
In addition, the --clock option causes rosbag play to publish simulated time synchronized to the messages in the bag file to the /clock topic. That way, your other nodes run as if they were executing when those messages were originally published.
CORRECTION: My mistake, rosbag play does not set use_sim_time for you. Setting it yourself is a good idea. That typically needs to be done before the other nodes start up.

Probably, you either forgot to set use_sim_time first, or you did not specify --clock on the playback.

Does 'they were executing when those messages were originally published' means it use the original timestamp when I recording? But when I rosbag play, receiver always get the latest timestamp and always different. What happened?

Basically, without --clock, nothing gets published on /clock. And if use_sim_time is true, it needs stuff on /clock
