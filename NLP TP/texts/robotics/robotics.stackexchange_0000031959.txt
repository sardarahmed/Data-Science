Q:

"Export directory" from package manifest

I am getting the following warning:
[rosbuild] WARNING: the file /Users/nick/.../externalLibs.cmake is being included automatically.  This behavior is deprecated.  The package containing that file should instead export the directory containing the file, and you should use rosbuild_include() to include the file explicitly.

How does one "Export the directory containing the file" in the manifest?

A:

The documentation for rosbuild_include() gives an example of what to do in the exporting package's manifest.
