Q:

modifying android_tutorial_pubsub. able to connect master on pc but roswtf and rxgraph suggests error

Hi ROS community,
I'm trying to modify the android_tutorial_pubsub in hope that the roscore is started on my PC instead of on Android.
I started roscore and set ROS_IP as well as ROS_MASTER_URI.
All I did to the code was delete
rosCore = RosCore.newPrivate();
rosCore.start();
try {
  rosCore.awaitStart();
} catch (Exception e) {
  throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
talker = new Talker();

nodeConfiguration.setMasterUri(rosCore.getUri());

and add:
nodeConfiguration.setMasterUri(URI.create("http://192.168.13.7:11311"));

so the code looks like this

    rosTextView = (RosTextView<org.ros.message.std_msgs.String>) findViewById(R.id.text);
    rosTextView.setTopicName("/chatter");
    rosTextView.setMessageType("std_msgs/String");
    rosTextView
        .setMessageToStringCallable(new MessageCallable<String, org.ros.message.std_msgs.String>() {
          @Override
          public String call(org.ros.message.std_msgs.String message) {
            return message.data;
          }
        });
  }

  @Override
  protected void init(NodeMainExecutor nodeMainExecutor) {
//    rosCore = RosCore.newPrivate();
//    rosCore.start();
//    try {
//      rosCore.awaitStart();
//    } catch (Exception e) {

    nodeMainExecutor.execute(talker, nodeConfiguration);
    nodeMainExecutor.execute(rosTextView, nodeConfiguration);
  }

  @Override
  protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    // RosCore should be shut down last since running Nodes will attempt to
    // unregister at shutdown.
//    rosCore.shutdown();
  }
}

when running, android is able to show Hello World n. so I assume android is then the two nodes talker and ros_text_view is able to connect the my master on PC.
but as I called roswtf, i got the following error:
Loaded plugin tf.tfwtf

Found 2 error(s).

ERROR Could not contact the following nodes:

ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't:
 * /rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/talker->/android_gingerbread/ros_text_view (/chatter)

Now I wonder whether the connection really succeeded, and what could possibly cause this conflict.
btw why can't I use rostopic pub to publish here?I tried rostopic pub /chatter std_msg/String abc but abc didn't show on my AVD. Did I miss anything?

Did you mean to comment out the line //    nodeConfiguration.setMasterUri(URI.create("http://192.168.13.7:11311"));?
Comment by rosdai on 2012-04-11:
sorry the code was wrong. In my own code this line wasn't commented out

A:

turned out this is a issue with AVD. If I use AVD, and need to forward port, which is very inconvenient.
also NodeConfiguration nodeConfiguration = NodeConfiguration.newPrivate(); set Master default to itself. change it to NodeConfiguration nodeConfiguration = NodeConfiguration.newPublic() and then nodeConfiguration.setMasterUri(URI.create("http://192.168.13.7:11311"));
