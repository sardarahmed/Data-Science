Q:

Getting map -> odom transform without using Gmapping

I need to get the map -> odom transform which is the pose of the robot in the map frame.
During the execution of my program, I serve a built map to the map server, so I fear that if I have gmapping running with the map server there may be a conflict, ie my program will subscribe to the wrong map topic.
Is there a way to get the map -> odom transform without using gmapping?
Or if I use gmapping will it cause a conflict in my program, if I have an exisiting map on the map server?

A:

If i understand correctly, you only want to localize in a given (static?) map. Have a look at AMCL, which should be exactly what you need.
If you are building your own map dynamically, i think you have to set use_map_topic to true and first_map_only to false (default).
