Q:

Navigation: Robot cannnot reach goal

Hello everyone,
I'm using navigation stack on a turtlebot-based robot. When launching move_base.launch, I can send 2d nav goal in Rviz and robot cannot find its way to the goal, it just makes small movements. It only reaches it when it is a orientation change but not position one.
I looked for errors with roswtf and I get:
ERROR The following nodes should be connected but aren't: * /move_base->/move_base (/move_base/global_costmap/footprint) * /move_base->/move_base (/move_base/local_costmap/footprint)
How can I fix it?

Typing turtlebot footprint into the search bar at the top of this page gets 259 hits. Please review some of those existing answers. If you figure it out, and it's different from what @osilva said, you can help out by answering your own question.

Thank you for your help. There wasn't any problem with topics.
Tuning navigation parameters solved my issue.
