Q:

Unintentional point cloud duplication during depth image conversion

I have a quite challenging question. I use ROS Melodic on Ubuntu18.04. My goal is to transform a ROS depth image to pointcloud2 format and show it in rviz. The theory seems ok, but I do not now where I fail. My problem can be seen on the image: it looks like that the pointcloud is somehow duplicated and shifted each other, although there is only one corridor in front of the camera.
I uploaded my code as a gist where I transform the depth image.
What I now see in rviz is this:

There is a corridoor in front of my camera, but somehow twice. I thought about the camera calibration and parameters, but I use the data from CameraInfo messages. Although I played with the fx,fy,cx,cy parameters, I cannot align to overleap the two corridor.
Where am I wrong?

A:

At first I thought there was some sort of systematic raw format or resolution error, sort of like ROS + kinect depth data duplication .
Then I noticed that each corridor appears in a different perspective, as if the sensor turned to point a different way between two captured frames. You didn't say what sensor you're using, but I assume it's not two cams that happen to point 45 degrees apart!
One might surmise that there are actually two or more frames piled up or appended in the same buffer -- sort of like a double exposure -- and the sensor actually did turn between the shots. Maybe some frame buffer or index needs to be cleared or reinitialized, or something, between frames?
