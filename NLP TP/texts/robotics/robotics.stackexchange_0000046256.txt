Q:

interactive_marker execution error

Hello;
After I've tried to create the interactive_markers package and copied all the folders from the source which are needed for the package from interactive_markers for electric. I got an error when I tried to build the package which is running the rosmake for this package. The error is:

~ros/interactive_markers/src/interactive_marker_server.cpp:431:
error:  ‘visualization_msgs’ has not
been declared ...

There are some other errors which is kind of related to the interactive_marker_server.cpp, but I do not paste it here.
So, what I wanna ask here, as it seems the package is new in electric, someone might have encountered this. Could anyone help me on this?
Thank you.

A:

The error suggests you are missing some includes which include "visualization_msgs".  You'll need to provide more information to get more help.
