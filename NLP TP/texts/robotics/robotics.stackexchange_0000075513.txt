Q:

Add to tutorials that roslaunch adds data-tail to args

I started my node via roslaunch and discovered a datatail in the last two arguments, I did not now about (used kinetic). This was misleading because I checked for the min args required and therefore not failed hiding the missing args with the ones below. Could someone add this to the tutorials.
argv[10] = 1
argv[11] = __name:=sensor_binder
argv[12] = __log:=/home/user/.ros/log/063c83b2-5491-11e6-8f9d-8ca9827a5146/sensor_binder-4.log

A:

This is an implementation detail that is normally handled by ros::init() and rospy.init_node(), so it would be clutter in the beginner tutorials.
There are a lot of other tutorials on the ROS wiki; which tutorial do you think this information should be included in?
These arguments are documented in the full ROS documentation on the remapping arguments page.

I guess roslaunch node would be ok with including your remapping link. Also one could emphasize the output on screen setting to let nodes talk to the terminal output.
