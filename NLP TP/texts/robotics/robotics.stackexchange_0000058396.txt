Q:

Failure in configuring ROS environment

I'm installing Groovy on ubuntu 12.04,when I'm configuring the environment,the following error occurs,(before this command it runs smoothly )
bash:/opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash:no such file or directory. 

I installed Fuerte a few days ago ,but before I'm configuring the environment for Groovy ,I have uninstalled it.
I have tried to open the file to check whether it exist or not ,put the command gedit /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash on the terminal,it was opened ,but it was empty.
What can I do to solve it ,thank you!

gedit /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash will open with empty doc, no matter if the file exists and is empty or does not exist. Go to the path in your file system (cd /opt   cd ros   cd hydro) and check (ls) whether the file exists...

Does the file or the entire folder (/opt/ros/hydro) exist? If not something might have gone wrong during sudo apt-get install or so, i. e. reinstall...

the entire folder (/opt/ros/hydro) does not exist, Do I have to reinstall ROS ? And I want to know the importance of the configuration of the evironment.

ROS is not installed in this case, try starting again for scratch with the steps noted here http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu

A:

If you want to use groovy, not hydro, you should source the file /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash not /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash.
Edit:
Please open your the file ~/.bashrc in an editor and check the lines that relate to ros (likely at the end of the file). There should be one line source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash. If there are multiple, or lines containting hyrdo, like source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash, then remove them and try again by opening a fresh terminal.

source ~/.bashrc

If the problem is solved, please mark one of the answers as accepted. If you have another question, open up another question. You will have to be a bit more specific than "I want to know the importance of the configuration of the evironment." though.
