Q:

My Robot Doesn't Move - What am I doing wrong?

Greetings,
I am have been working for days struggling through all the documentation and reading forums. All this to no avail.
My Failed Robot Gist Here
I can get the robot to load in RVIZ just fine. The Joints all rotate as expected. Once I get to Gazebo though, it just sort or rolls a tiny bit back and forth. I have a little window that pops up where I can induce some forward velocity on the left wheel.
But NOTHING happens. Would anyone be so kind to check out files in the Gist? I played with intertials and PIDs but NOTHING is working.
Cheers,
Coach

A:

So the first error I see is that you do not load the joint_state_controller in the controller_spawner node.
ackerman.launch:
line: 13
<node name="controller_spawner" pkg="controller_manager" type="spawner" respawn="false" 
   output="screen" ns="/basic_frame_pig" args="joint_state_controller 
                                               front_left_wheel_controller"/>

After that the namespaces might be little challenging so if this isn't enough to make it work, I would look into the namespaces.
