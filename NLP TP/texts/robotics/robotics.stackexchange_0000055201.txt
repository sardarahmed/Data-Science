Q:

Where is directory of the pcl source codes?

Hi my friends,
I am a newbie and working on kinect with pcl on ROS.
I can run the tutorials on the ros website, but the weird thing is that i cannot find the  implementation of all the class I have imported.
eg. #include <pcl/filters/extract_indices.h>
I can find the headfile is in  /opt/ros/groovy/include/pcl-1.6/pcl/filters/extract_indices.h
but i cannot find its corresponding .cpp file.
I thought it must be inside /opt/ros/groovy/stack/, but it is not there.
Could anyone to clear my doubts?
Thanks a lot in advance!
JK

A:

It will be there in /opt/ros/groovy/share/ if its not there in /opt/ros/groovy/stacks/.
Or wherever it is, just locate it using command locate extract_indices.cpp in ubuntu.
