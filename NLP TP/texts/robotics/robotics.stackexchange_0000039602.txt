Q:

Create/Roomba odometry

Hi,
I am thinking of getting a iRobot Create or a Roomba for a project which requires some no-so-bad odometry.
I have gone through this thread  and I have also noticed the following comment on turtlebot_node/roomba_sensor_handler.py
   114     # The distance and angle calculation sent by the robot seems to
   115     # be really bad. Re-calculate the values using the raw enconder
   116     # counts.

If I get a iRobot create I will get only the distance and angle which 'seems to be really bad' since iRobot create does not give out raw encoder counts.
I would like to know if this is still the case ? I prefer iRobot create since it is inexpensive and I don't need the vacuum function.
Furthermore, It would be great if any of the users can give me some quantitative values on the odometry errors.

p.s: Calling up iRobot support did not help at all :(

A:

This was actually my comment  :-). My problem was that odometry was actually really broken, i.e. it gave completely wrong values on the roomba. That's why the roomba driver uses the raw encoder values. I didn't try, but i expect the iCreate to give at least correct odometry values but maybe someone who owns one might want to confirm that.
