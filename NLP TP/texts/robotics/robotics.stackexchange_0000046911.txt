Why can sudo apt-get update find the ros repositories for groovy?
I am getting the following error when performing the operation...
W: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/quanta1/main/binary-amd64/Packages   404   Not found
W: Failed to fetch http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu/dists/quanta1/main/binary-i386/Packages   404   Not found
What should I do?
Somehow, someone put quanta1 instead of quantal in the sources.list.  Someone from Willow Garage should fix that.  Thanks!

A:

The instructions here look correct. You need to fix the contents of your apt sources.  Usually the default location is in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
