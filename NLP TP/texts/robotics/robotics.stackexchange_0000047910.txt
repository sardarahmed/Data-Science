Q:

Why rosmake does not work?

Hi, I'm new and I tried to use rosmake like this

rosmake demo

But I get a problem

[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...

[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: ['demo']

[ rosmake ] Logging to directory /home/senna/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20130203-110054

[ rosmake ] Expanded args ['demo'] to:

[]

[ rosmake ] WARNING: The following args could not be parsed as stacks or packages: ['demo']

[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.

No idea why. Waiting for help. Thanks.

A:

It seems that you have not set the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH. If demo is in your Desktop folder, first you should execute:

export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/Desktop:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}

then you can use rosmake to execute:

rosmake demo
