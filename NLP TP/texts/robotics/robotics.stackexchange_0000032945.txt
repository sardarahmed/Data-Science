Q:

Is it possible to save the rxloggerlevel level's?

I have a launch file launching several nodes and I'm interested on saving a certain configuration of warn/debug/info depending on the node. Is it possible to save a specific configuration or a way of launching it setting the levels accordingly other than changing them manually at every execution?

A:

Yes. You can set the ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE environment variable and have that point to a custom log4cxx config that sets the loggerlevels how you want it.
I guess you want to set debug for your package enabled, then use this entry:
log4j.logger.ros.PACKAGE=DEBUG

There's a ros-specific example at http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosconsole#Configuration.  Rospy uses a different system based on the Python logging module, described here: http://www.ros.org/wiki/rospy/Overview/Logging.  At the bottom of the page it describes how to set up a config file for this.

Actually, since roscpp is using log4cxx, its documentation on the config file format might be the right one: http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/index.html. Im not sure if this approach works for rospy though since it doesn't use log4cxx.

There is an example in my post. To check syntax and specifics about rosconsole, click the link in my post and then also look at rosconsole. It's in rosconsole, so I would guess it is loaded in node init.

Looks like it! So I'd have to create a config file and point the ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE to it. Where can I find the syntax or an example of a config file? When is it loaded? when roscore is launched? when rxconsole is launched? (I'm sorry the documentation about the subject is too scarce...)
