Q:

Syntax of rqt_graph filters

I recently noticed, that you can use a wildcard character in rqt_graph to select node or topic names. For example "/imu*" would only show all nodes/topics which start with "/imu".
Is there a way to logically link multiple filter expressions together, e.g. "Show all nodes, which start with '/imu' or '/move'"?

A:

According to the tooltip and the code for that, the filter edit boxes accept a comma separated list of regexps:

Topic filter, comma separated list of names/regexp to include or exclude. Example: -/tf

So the regexp could have optional and required matches as well.
Doesn't seem to be documented too well, but this comment on issue 4 of the rqt_graph issue tracker has an example:

You can add filter, some sort of: -(._parameter_updates),-(._parameter_descriptions)
