Q:

headless RGBDSlam .PLY saver

Hi,
I'm using RGBDSlam in headless mode and I would like to save all clouds in one .PLY file. the "rosservice call /rgbdslam/ros_ui save_all" service is saving the into a .PCD file. Is the a parameter that I can add to headless.launch?
I changed the source code in ros_service_ui.cpp . It saves to ply file now but meshlab is not able to load it and gives some error about shader. I guess I'm doing something wrong.

Does it work to open them when you save via the GUI?

Also, can you post the change that you did in ros_service_ui.cpp? Changing from ".pcd" to ".ply" will not do the job.

A:

Sorry, there's no choice from the service call interface. Not sure yet whether to consider it a bug or not. For a quick fix, edit ros_service_ui.cpp's method saveIndividual(), so that the tmpfilename ends with .ply.
