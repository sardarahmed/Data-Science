Q:

How to add an icon to a custom display type in RViz?

I wrote a custom display type for RViz (see e.g. here) and I would like to have an icon displayed, when I browse for it in RViz.
In the above link, I see that there is a OculusDisplay.png in the directory icons/classes/.., but I can not figure out, how to link this. Does anybody know how this is done?

A:

As far as I can tell, that's it, you've essentially figured it out.
For a custom display I put together, I just copied my png to the icons/classes/ directory, with the same name as the Display (I believe as it's found in the plugin_description.xml file).
With that done, it just worked.

lol, it's as easy as that. I forgot to change the name of the icon according to my display type, how silly.
