Q:

RGBDSLAM_v2 save Octomap at a particular z value

As stated in the title, is there a way to save octomap(GUI or commandline) at a particular z value? Is there a way to do it by tweaking either the launch files or source code? If so, where to locate these files?
I am currently running roslaunch rgbdslam openni+rgbdslam.launch, and then saving the octomap using the GUI. The reason why only a particular z value is desired is because the generation of full octomap takes quite some time, and I'm thinking of ways to shorten the time required.

A:

In the rgbdslam_v2 source code, check out the method GraphManager::firstNode(...) in graph_manager.cpp. There, the reference_pose is set (to identity).
