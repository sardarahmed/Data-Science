Q:

I suspect vim-ros plugin is not working appropriately

Hello all.
I just installed the vim plugin vim-ros but I fell it is not working or at least not appropriately. Well, after its installation a source file from some ROS package and tried the commands :A, :Roscd and :Rosed and none of them worked. In fact the following message is printed by vim:

E492: Not an editor command: A

So, I would like to know what am I missing to correctly configure the vim-ros plugin.
Thanks

I would report this on the issue tracker of vim-ros. That will probably lead to quicker resolution of your issues.

Could issues/18 be related?

thanks!!! I will check it.

A:

For completeness, I'll post the answer here.
gvdhoorn was right; it was related to issues/18. The fix is to install vim with Python 2.7 support:
sudo apt-get install vim-nox-py2
