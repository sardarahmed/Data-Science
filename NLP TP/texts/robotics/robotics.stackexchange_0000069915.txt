A:

The errors you listed (LibraryUnloadException) are a known issue when disposing of a MoveGroup object (see here), but should not affect the observed planning or execution.
Check the terminal window in which you launched the move_group node (not the same window as above) for additional error messages.  Are you sure that the planning was completed successfully?  The ROS-I tutorial you reference tries to move the robot to a random joint position, which is not always reachable by the robot.  You may see failure messages related to "unreachable position" or similar.
