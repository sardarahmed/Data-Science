Q:

Calling a multiplexer select from a node

Hi I'm wondering how I would go about calling the multiplexer select from inside a node instead of using the command line tool. Are there any examples on how to accomplish this as I cannot find any?
Thanks in advance for any help you can give.

A:

Just incase anyone ever has a similar question I finally realised what I had been doing wrong while going through the source code for mux_select and it appears to be working now. Simply follow their example here:
