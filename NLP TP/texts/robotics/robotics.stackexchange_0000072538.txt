Q:

Intermittent map with bag file [closed]

Hi! I am using a bag file to save my map made with hector_slam but when I start the bag file I see an intermittent map. Is there a way to see it continuously instead make it appear and disappear every second? Also can I only save the final image of the map? Thanks for your help!
