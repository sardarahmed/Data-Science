Q:

an example of a robotic arm in ROS

Hello, I have to do a small project in which I must simulate a robotic arm. I found ROS software very interesting and I would like to use it in order to complete my project. However, I spent a lot of time reading all kind of sites about how to get it started with no results. Does anyone know an application that could fit for my case and how it must be installed?
Thank you!

A:

The URDF tutorials guide you step by step in creating the model of your robot arm, and running it in the Gazebo simulator.
