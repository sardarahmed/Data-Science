The callback function commandTurtle (source code) publishes the twist message, which defines the linear and angular velocity of the turtle.
The interface of the functions looks like void commandTurtle(ros::Publisher twist_pub, float linear, float angular). The float linear argument defines the forward velocity of the turtle.
Therefore, try changing the argument passed to the commandTurtle function when the void forward  (source code)
