Q:

ROS on BeagleBone Issues

I'm trying to get ROS Fuerte on a BeagleBone. I've gone through both these processes:

http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu/Source
but nothing ever builds in the opt folder. What am I missing?

Hi Peter,
I have been looking at the answer you pointed to. I have not gotten to the Level 2 install as I have not had success with the Level 1. I've spent most of the day on installing Ubuntu issues and options. I should get back to ROS install tomorrow and I will report back what I find. Thanks for your post.

Hi Peter,
Your links made for a good start. I also found the following link (http://sysadminfixes.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/ros-on-beaglebuntu/comment-page-1/)  that highligted how to get ROS Groovy on the Beagle so I moved to the Groovy install rather than Fuerte.
