Q:

Installing Gazebo on a mac (Lion OSX)

Have anyone installed Gazebo in an iMac?
I am trying to install it in Lion (mas OSX). I have downloaded the source code, tar it, use make, and then got stuck trying to use cmake.
The problem seem to be that I don't have these packages: build-essential libtinyxml-dev libtbb-dev libxml2-dev libqt4-dev pkg-config  libprotoc-dev libfreeimage-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libboost-all-dev freeglut3-dev
I have tried to get them with Flink and apt-get, but it just won't find the packages. Is it possible that, since I am using Lion, there are no suitable versions of those packages and thus apt does not find them?
Thanks a lot for your comments. I have been searching the web for hours and I cannot figure out the way of finishing the installation of Gazebo. I have also searched this forum, but I got no results for "mac" or "OSX", so I guessed this is the first time this question is being asked.
Also, I am starting a new project and lots of these things are new to me, so please tell me if I am doing something wrong. Thanks again.

A:

Gazebo, currently has not been tested on OS X.
The new version of Gazebo (to be release in Fuerte) should support OS X, but the current one probably will not work, there are several problems preventing it from running on OS X.
