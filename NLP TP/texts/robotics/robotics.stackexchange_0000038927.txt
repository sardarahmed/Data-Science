Q:

save position of robot online slam?

Hi
I want to save the current position of robot while the navigation with online slam is running and then i can set those saved position as 2d goals in navigation with static map!
i can get current position of the robot in map frame when i am running navigation stack with static map by subscribing to amcl/pose topic. but in navigation with online slam amcl does not publishes any point.
So how can i get robots current position in online slam?
thanks!

A:

If you use gmapping, the robot's pose is published via a tf. You can use tf_echo to display this transformation:
rosrun tf tf_echo /map /base_link

You may also try out hector_trajectory_server for saving and retrieving the traveled trajectory.

I tried out rosrun tf tf_echo /map /base_link and its result was very good! but i will test hector_trajectory_server too! thanks for your answer!
