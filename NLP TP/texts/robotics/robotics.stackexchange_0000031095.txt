Q:

Automatic installation of dependencies

Hi all,
my package depends on the openni_kinect stack, which can be installed either from source or with apt.
I would like to write instructions for users, so that they can download and build my package and openni_kinect is automatically installed if necessary. So I added openni_kinect (I also tried with openni_camera) to my package's manifest.xml. I tried rosdep install <pkg-name>, which says:
Failed to find stack for package [openni_kinect]
Failed to load rosdep.yaml for package [openni_kinect]:Cannot locate installation of package openni_kinect: [rospack] couldn't find package [openni_kinect]. ROS_ROOT[/opt/ros/diamondback/ros] ROS_PACKAGE_PATH[/home/endres/Phd/rospacks:/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks]

The same happens for openni_camera and accordingly rosmake --rosdep-install fails, in either case too.
Also rosdep.yaml files seem to be meant for external libraries, not ros packages.
rosinstall in contrast seems to be for source distributions.
Is there something I am missing, or do you have to install ros-dependencies explicitly?

A:

rosdeps are indeed for system dependencies (libraries), while the <depend package=.../> tags in the manifest are for ROS dependencies. Unfortunately, they do not automatically get resolved to Debian packages if you installed ROS through apt (though that would be nice to have).
Once your package / stack is released its stack dependencies will get mapped to dependencies on ROS Debian packages, so that if you install it all stacks it depends on will get installed as well.
