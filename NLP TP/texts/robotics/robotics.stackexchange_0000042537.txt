Q:

PCL Visualizer error

When I make(using rosmake) the PCL visualizer tutorial - (http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcl_visualizer.php#pcl-visualizer)
I get this error-
/opt/ros/fuerte/include/pcl-1.5/pcl/visualization/common/common.h:39:24: fatal error: vtkCommand.h: No such file or directory
It seems that ros is unable to find vtk modules.
Can anyone help?

Yes I am using Fuerte on ubuntu precise
The command returned---All system dependencies have been satisified
I also checked for libvtk5-dev which is installed on my system.
Is there a way to directly link libraries like libvtk5-dev using CMakeLists.txt which may help me.
And thanks for your response

Also i don't know how to comment joq's answers so i just commented here. No post a comment link on your answer

You can edit your own question, often a good idea.

A:

Ok I found the answer. I explicitly added the vtk modules and libraries to CMakeList and it worked fine. I added the two following lines at the end
include_directories(/usr/include/vtk-5.8)
target_link_libraries(pcl_viz ${PCL_LIBRARIES} libvtkCommon.so libvtkFiltering.so libvtkRendering.so)
here pcl_viz is my executable
I would prefer that ros take care of these things as in the standalone PCL

That is not a good solution. As you say, ROS should take care of it properly. If it does not, please open a defect ticket.

This fixes the issue for me perfectly! Thanks!
This issue is still present in ROS Groovy on Ubuntu Raring 64bit.
