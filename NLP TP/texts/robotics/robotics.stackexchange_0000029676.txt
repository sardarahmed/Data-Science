Q:

Visualizing continuous and revolute joint types in rviz

When creating a URDF file for a robot with a head on a pan and tilt mechanism, whenever I try to use a joint type "continuous" or "revolute" in a manner similar to that shown in the tutorials the model is displayed within Rviz as a disorganized jumble.  If I change the joint type to "fixed" then the model displays normally.  The model also seems to check out ok using check_urdf, and no URDF errors show up when Rviz is loading.  This seems to be a bug, since the same thing happens with the tutorial file 06-flexible.urdf
I'm using the current cturtle full binary installation on Ubuntu 10.10.

A:

For non-fixed joints you need some source that publishes the joint states, otherwise the model cannot be displayed correctly, as the state of the joints is unknown.
A simple launch files for testing a URDF model in rviz using the joint_state_publisher looks like this:
<launch>
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py $(find yourrobot_urdf)/yourrobot/robot_base.urdf.xacro" />
<param name="use_gui" value="True"/>
<node name="joint_state_publisher" pkg="joint_state_publisher" type="joint_state_publisher" ></node>
<node name="robot_state_publisher" pkg="robot_state_publisher" type="state_publisher" />
<node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz" />
</launch>

Ah, ok, that could be it!

Should I change robot_description to others? I got error "Cannot load command parameter [robot_description]: ...". I'm using Groovy. Thanks!

Hard to say what is wrong in your case without more information. You should probably create a new question with a detailed problem description.
