Q:

ROS doesn´t run into NAO robot

Hi, I am using the newer Nao. I have installed ROS electric (desktop) over ubuntu 10.04 with the atom toolchain 1.12.5. Today it compiles onto the pc. Buuut, ROS still doesnt run over the NAO. I have copied all the ros files from pc to nao via ssh. I obtain that:
nao [0] ~/ros $ ls
electric  setup.sh

nao [0] ~/ros $ /home/nao/ros/setup.sh
-bash: /home/nao/ros/setup.sh: Permission denied

nao [err 126] ~/ros $ source /home/nao/ros/electric/setup.bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
ImportError: No module named yaml
rospack could not be found, you cannot have rosbash features until you bootstrap ros

nao [0] ~/ros $ roscd
-bash: roscd: command not found

nao [err 127] ~/ros $ 

Thanks.

A:

Solved.
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TARGETDIR/libs:\\\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> $TARGETDIR/ros/setup.sh
echo "export PYTHONPATH=\\\$PYTHONPATH:$TARGETDIR/python" >> $TARGETDIR/ros/setup.sh
echo "source $TARGETDIR/ros/electric/setup.bash" >> $TARGETDIR/ros/setup.sh

Append at the top of file $TARGETDIR/ros/setup.sh
#!/bin/sh

In a NAOś bash, run setup.sh
$TARGETDIR/ros
. ./setup.sh
