Q:

How to reflect (or mirror) a point cloud in rviz?

Hello,
I have successfully set-up ros so that a point cloud is sent to rviz every 100ms. It looks great, however, the visualization is mirrored about the z-y axis.
I have already tried using static_transform_publisher (http://wiki.ros.org/tf#static_transform_publisher), but this only allows me to rotate or translate. Is there a way to reflect/mirror about an axis using static_transform_publisher?
Any help is appreciated.

A generic open source point cloud scaling node/let could be useful for other people (or does it already exist?)- every axis could have a scale factor that could also be negative, allowing for mirroring and other uses.

A:

You could look at fixing the mirroring upstream- in whatever is generating the point cloud, or create a node that subscribes to your mirrored point cloud and flips each point as needed then republishes, look at http://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros#Subscribing_to_point_clouds for the starting point.
