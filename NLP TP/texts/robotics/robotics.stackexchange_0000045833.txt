Q:

android_tutorial_camera not working

Hello all,
we are trying to use android_tutorial_camera using ROS Fuerte on Ubuntu 12.04
We built rosjava_core and android_core according to the tutorials.
Then we built and deployed the apk on a tablet (running Android 4.1).
The app starts ok, but the camera topic does not appear on the computer running the master (by running rostopic list).
Any hints?
Thank you

A:

I have exactly the same problem. I use ubuntu 11.10, ROS fuerte and a samsung galaxy tab 2.
My tablet is connected to the desktop with a USB cable. I'm quite sure I use the ROS_MASTER_URI from roscore correctly.
