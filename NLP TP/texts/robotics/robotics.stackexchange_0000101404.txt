Q:

Call a service from WaypointTaskExecutor plugin

Hello there
I am developing my own WaypointTaskExecutor plugin to be executed at waypoints (using nav2's waypoint_follower). Is there a way to call a service or at least publish some data on a topic, from within my plugin?

A:

Did you check the photo_at_waypoint source code there? I think you can base your solution on it.
@stevemacenski wrote about it (1, 2, 3) as an example plugin for processing.
