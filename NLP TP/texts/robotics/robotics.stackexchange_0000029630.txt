Q:

rosbag play & tf static_transform_publisher

I've recorded some data and realized one of my static transforms was wrong. Specifically, I'm want to run robot_pose_ekf, but my /base_footprint to /imu transform is upside down.
I want to play back the data with a new transform, provided by tf's static_transform_publisher node. But this doesn't work because the data's time is in the past, and transform's time is in the present. Is it possible to have static_transform_publisher broadcast in the past? Or is there something else I can do?
To clarify, I get warnings that look like this:

[ WARN] [1297969705.023576238]: You
requested a transform that is
75418.058 seconds in the past, but the tf buffer only has a history of 10.685
seconds.

A:

You can use the tf_remap script to filter the output of your bag file.  See the tf wiki page
To use it you will want to remap your playback to put /tf onto /old_tf and then use tf_remap to move most things from /old_tf to /tf with your remappings applied.
To deal with the timing issue you should set use_sim_time parameter and playback the bag file with the clock option enabled.
