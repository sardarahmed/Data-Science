Q:

fuerte rgbdslam problem with eigen

Hi.
I'm going to start the 3d mapping project with rgbdslam and octomap.
but I'm struggling with rgbdslam.
I installed rgbdslam from source(using rosinstall)
and I wrote
$ rosdep install rgbdslam
then it said,
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rgbdslam: Missing resource eigen
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
there are already many Q&A's about fuerte and eigen problems, but I couldn't solve my problems with them.
This link is the answer already suggested.
But in my case, the manifest.xml file of rgbdslam already contains  instead of .
Also, I edited my manifest.xml file and CMakeLists.txt as "http://ros.org/wiki/eigen" says, but it was of no use as well.
Here is my manifest.xml.
<package>

  <description brief="SLAM on RGBD Data">

    This package can be used to register the point clouds from RGBD sensors such as the kinect or stereo cameras.

    The rgbdslam node can be connected easily to an octomap_server node to create a memory-efficient 3D map.

</package>

And the eigen part of my CMakeLists.txt
#############################
# Eigen ####################
#############################
find_package(Eigen)

IF(Eigen_FOUND)

  include_directories(${EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIRS})

  add_definitions(${EIGEN_DEFINITIONS})

ELSE(Eigen_FOUND)

  MESSAGE("Eigen package was not found. This is OK FOR ROS ELECTRIC, bad for fuerte\n")

ENDIF(Eigen_FOUND)

Do you have any solutions about this?
Thanks in advance! :)

Did you do sudo rosdep init and rosdep update at some point before?
Comment by Felix Endres on 2012-11-15:
What dornhege says. Is libeigen3-dev installed?

A:

Hi dornhege, Felix. I solved my problem. It's the problem of code of pcl which was out of date, so i erased it and reinstall it, it worked. Thanks for your kind answer and upgrading my question to cleaner version :)
