Q:

5 finger Schunk SVH Hand

Hi
I am working on object Grasping using Schunk SVH hand.
I have the following questions -

Is there any other institution / organization working on a similar project ?
Is there any grasp planning library in ROS ( or C++) available for Schunk SVH Hand ? If not for Schunk hand, then for any other 4/5 fingers hand ?

Thanks

You might want to checkout the ipa320 repository, they have some Schunk related packages. Also: the ROS Index site returns quite some results for schunk, see here.

Heyho,
at least for simple grasps you can just rely on the internal position/current controller by closing it completely. This produced good results, also for fragile objects. But of course that is not really what you want.
You can take a look at GraspIt! http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cmatei/graspit/ maybe it is helpful for you.
Best Regards
Georg
