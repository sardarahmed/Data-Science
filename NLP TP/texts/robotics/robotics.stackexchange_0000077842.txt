Q:

When run rbx1_nav, and rviz :fixed frame :fixed frame [map] do not exist

Hi,everyone. I install ros-by-exanple-indigo code on my computer.And I prepare to test fake robot simulator.However,Once I run the .launch file there will be a mistake in rviz.See follow.
run command:
roscore

and
roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_turtlebot.launch

Then:
rosrun rviz rviz -d 'rospack find rbx1_nav' /sim.rviz

then there's a mistake in rviz,
Global Status ï¼šerror fixed frame :fixed frame [map] do not exist

(the node works fine, as I publish the command to it and it can show it moves from the command line screen. So there should be some problems with the rviz I guess.)
What direction should I go?
Thanks.

A:

Self-answering again...:
Found this tool is quite useful: roswtf. It tells me that my ROS_HOSTNAME is not set correctly. I just changed my IP and my hostname to this machine, so that's the reason.
Suggestion would be:
change your IP address in /etc/hosts and /etc/network/interfaces. And make sure in the ~/.bashrc your IP address is correct. For a single machine, suggest your IP address is set to 127.0.0.1.
