Q:

rmw_implementation dependency on rmw_opensplice_cpp

Hello,
I just upgraded to Dashing and ran into this issue when compiling control_msgs. As a workaround, I wanted to just uninstall the current openslice packages but there appears to be a required dependency chain that won't let it uninstall.
rclcpp -> rmw_implementation -> rmw_opensplice_cpp -> rosidl_typesupport_opensplice_cpp
I would not have expected rmw_implementation to depend on rmw_opensplice_cpp here (or rmw_fastrtps_cpp). Is this intended? Note, for example, that rosidl_typesupport_cpp only suggests rosidl_typesupport_opensplice_cpp, which is what I would expect.
(side note: "dashing" needs to be added to the ROS answers distribution tag list)

A:

It looks like you're seeing this issue, and the fix is in the process of being released.
The opensplice packages can be temporarily removed using dpkg.
sudo dpkg --remove --force-depends ros-dashing-rmw-opensplice-cpp ros-dashing-rosidl-typesupport-opensplice-cpp ros-dashing-rosidl-typesupport-opensplice-c
Before you upgrade or install other packages you'll want to reinstall the opensplice packages that were force uninstalled using
sudo apt-get install --fix-broken
