Q:

How to detect subscriber's queue is full (and messages are thrown away)

I'm a newbie ros user.
According to tutorials, messages may disappear if the subscriber's queue is full.
I need to know if the message is lost. Is it possible?

A:

I see you linked to a roscpp tutorial.
If you want to see if a message is being dropped, you can set the subscribing node's logger level to DEBUG and look for the message "Incoming queue was full for topic"
I don't see a way to check that programmatically.

or you can add a piece of code in the callback function : to check whether the queue is full and print something.But that's just a double work.
