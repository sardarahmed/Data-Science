Q:

Laser Scan publisher

I have written a laser scan filter based off of geometric correction. It is doing well, so I'd like to try mapping with it. After the scan is filtered, it is stored in a pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ> PointCloud. I need to take this and convert it to a laser scan for gmapping. Any helpful hints as to how I go about this?

A:

Have a look at point_cloud_to_laserscan.
All you need to do is publish your pcl::PointCloud use the point_cloud_to_laserscan node to get the corresponding laser scan. In the ros package turtlebot_bringup you'll find an example launch file that converts Kinect point clouds to laser scans.

Ok. The topic I'm publishing is "cloud". I'm working with a topic, titled "scan" that is already running. How do I discern the two for mapping?
