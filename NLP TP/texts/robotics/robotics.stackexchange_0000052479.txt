Q:

Using the sicktoolbox_wrapper with LMS1xx

I am trying to connect an LMS111 through my computer's ethernet port, and use it with the sicktoolbox_wrapper.  Will the package work properly with an LMS1xx?  Are there any changes to the tutorial steps I need to do, particularly concerning the permission configuration to the ethernet port (eth1 in my case), in order to make it work?

Hi,
For for LMS1xx Series I think the driver is here LMS1xx driver. I have used the driver package with SICK LMS100.
The command for running the driver after connecting it via Ethernet is
rosrun LMS1xx LMS100 _host:=192.168.0.1

where 192.168.0.1 is the IP of the Laser-scanner(I think IP I used is the default one, not sure though). Change it according to your IP settings.

Hello, I am in the same situation as the person who asked this question, and tried your solution (I had to modify if to the following: rosrun lms1xx LMS100.launch _host:=(my_ip_adress) in order for it to say it could find the files and stuff).
However, now I am getting the error:
cannot launch node of type [LMS1xx/LMS1xx_node]: LMS1xx
ros path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ros path[1]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ros path[2]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks
no processes to monitor
ANy idea what could be going wrong?  Thanks,
Randyh
