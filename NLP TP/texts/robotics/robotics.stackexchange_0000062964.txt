Q:

How to install rosbridge on NAO robot

Hi,
I am thinking about a possibility to install rosbridge on NAO robot. I've got an idea but im not sure if its correct idea.
I am downloading (rosbridge) source files and put it into a VM where i've got a virtual NAO system.

I've installed there a ROS system. But what i do next.
I move download files to a directory my_workspace/src (this is a folder that was created during a tutorial "compilation From Virtual Nao": http://wiki.ros.org/nao/Installation/compileFromVirtualNao)
and then i just run a command: src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
after a compilation i have to find dependencies and send them on the robot, where i've already installed ros system.

Do you think it would be right approach?

Hi,
You're right that's exactly the way to proceed. The tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/nao/Installation/compileFromVirtualNao explains how to cross-compile and install ros on your nao. But it's exactly the same process to cross-compile any ros package for your nao.
If you've troubles compiling/running the packages, you can update your thread on the SIG https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ros-sig-aldebaran.
