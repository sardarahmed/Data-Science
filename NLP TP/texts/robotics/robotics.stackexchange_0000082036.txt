Q:

Bringup Turtlebot3

I accidentally connect wrong wire to the opencr board which caused a short and may damage the board. When I bring up the turtlebot, this red items showed up on RViz. Are they related to the motors?

Is this a duplicate of #q267562? Or the other way around?

A:

If the OpenCR board is damaged the lack of wheel odometry would be expected.
