Q:

DRCSIM: Atlas URDF glitches

Torque limits on leg_uhz are not the same: 110 vs 260

/usr/share/drcsim-2.3/ros/atlas_description/urdf/atlas.urdf
<joint name="l_leg_uhz" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0 0.089 0" rpy="0 -0 0" />
    <axis xyz="0 0 1" />
    <parent link="pelvis" />
    <child link="l_uglut" />
    <dynamics damping="0.1" friction="0" />
    <limit effort="110" velocity="12" lower="-0.32" upper="1.14" />

<joint name="r_leg_uhz" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0 -0.089 0" rpy="0 -0 0" />
    <axis xyz="0 0 1" />
    <parent link="pelvis" />
    <child link="r_uglut" />
    <dynamics damping="0.1" friction="0" />
    <limit effort="260" velocity="12" lower="-1.14" upper="0.32" />

As long as we are cleaning up the model.
l_lglut:ixy and r_lglut:ixy should have opposite signs, same for lglut:iyz,
uglut:ixy, uglut:iyz, lleg:ixz, hand:ixz

These links have no inertial fields, so the default mass and moi need to be zero.

A:

For questions 1 and 2, there's a pull request.  Some of the moi signs had already been fixed, but a couple had not.  Thanks for finding those!
For question 3, those frame just don't factor into simulation.  They have no mass, inertia, or other physical properties.

This problems have fixed in source files. But, atlas.urdf and atlas_sandia_hands.urdf in debian package (drcsim2.6.1) still remain. ex. effort_limit of r_leg_uhz is 260.
