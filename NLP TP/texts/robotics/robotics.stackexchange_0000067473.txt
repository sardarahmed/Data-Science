A:

For Python you don't really need to configure CMakeLists.txt
You could just use opencv directly in Python by including it as follows:
import cv2

Then use all opencv algorithms accessible under the namespace cv2 (cv2.imshow() for example). You should of course have opencv installed on your computer.
For converting between OpenCV image format and ROS images check this tutorial

Sorry my mistake, I edited the code. Normally all should work fine if you installed opencv from the debs using sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
