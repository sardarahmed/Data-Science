Q:

Unable to find/use catkin package

Hi everyone. I'm new to ROS and are following the tutorial.
I have just created a package as seen in section 4 at the "CreatingPackage" tutorial (did not have enough karma to post the link)
I am now at section 5.1 trying to find my package and look at the dependencies i just set.
$ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials
The only response i get is "[rospack] Error: no such package beginner_tutorials"
I also tried the command "$ roscd beginner_tutorials" but this returns "roscd: No such package/stack 'beginner_tutorials'".
I can see that the files are present when I look for them in the folder so the problem is that ROS does not recognize them as a package.
I don't know what to do. Please help!
My system is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, ROS Hydro Medusa.

HI, How do you create your package?(where you create the package)
you can use ros build system easier than to use catkin

A:

You need to create a proper catkin workspace as described in

catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace

Particularly it is to point out that you need to source the created setup.bash each time you open a new shell ( or add it to your ~/.bashrc; make sure to change the path to the correct one for your installation ):
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
