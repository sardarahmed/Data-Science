Q:

rtabmap_ros doesnt display any output

Hi,
I am new to  rtabmap_ros. I have installed  rtabmap_ros for indigo & was following steps mentioned in

http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros

to run the demo_mapping.bag file. The problem is  rtabmap_ros will open but nothing is getting displayed.
Can anyone help me out to solve this.

What exact commands did you use?
Comment by shashankbhat on 2017-05-08:
roslaunch rtabmap_ros demo_robot_mapping.launch
rosbag play --clock demo_mapping.bag

A:

Cannot reproduce the problem (Indigo binaries, version 0.11.8):
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros demo_robot_mapping.launch
$ rosbag play --clock demo_mapping.bag

If you launch with RVIZ, do you see something?
$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros demo_robot_mapping.launch rviz:=true rtabmapviz:=false

Can you copy/paste the terminal output in your question?
