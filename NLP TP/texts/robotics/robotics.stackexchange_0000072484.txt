Q:

CMake Error in ROS Navigation

Hi! I followed these steps to install ROS navigation:
 cd catkin_ws/src
 git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation.git
 cd ..
 catkin_make

but I have this error
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:283 (message):
  A required package was not found
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:337 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
  navigation/robot_pose_ekf/CMakeLists.txt:6 (pkg_check_modules)

What does it mean? How do I fix? Thank you!

A:

This has been asked before.
A quick search leads to Installing package from source in Indigo for instance. Be sure to change the appropriate parts of the answer (github url, package names, etc).
