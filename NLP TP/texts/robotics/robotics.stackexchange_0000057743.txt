Q:

Not able to compile a .msg using pcl_msgs type variables

Hello everyone,
I am working on Groovy and have all the libraries installed.
I have created a custom .msg file with following entries :
Header header
pcl_msgs/PolygonMesh mesh
sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 normals
I have included pcl_msgs in my package.xml and CMakelists.txt also.
But unfortunately on compilation I get following errors
-- checking for module 'openni-dev'
--   package 'openni-dev' not found
-- Could NOT find openni (missing:  OPENNI_INCLUDE_DIRS) 
** WARNING ** io features related to openni will be disabled
-- checking for module 'openni-dev'

I have looked through  pcl forums but not able to resolve this problem. Any kind of guidance would be much appreciated.
Thanks

A:

It looks like the pcl_msgs that are released into Groovy are in the pcl namespace; try declaring your message dependency on pcl instead of pcl_msgs.
