Q:

problems navigation 3d p3dx kinect

I used ubuntu 10.10 and ros electric.
I want to navigate with this component but I can't. All the tutorials in 3d are with pr2 robot and the rest of tutorials are in 2d.
I try with this tutorial
http://www.ros.org/wiki/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup
But it is for 2d navigation.
I also try with this other
http://ros.org/wiki/3d_navigation
But it is for pr2 robot, and i can't execute it.
I don't know if i can navigate in 3d or i should convert the kinect 3d points in 2d for the navigation.
Can you help me please??

A:

If you use the kinect PointCloud as the input to the costmaps, it will automatically convert it for 2d navigation. See costmap_2d for information on how to add sensor inputs.
