Q:

Rviz closing just after being run, problems with NVidia driver

After localizing and temporarily solving an SSE3-issue with openni_camera (ticket #4870) I'm facing another issue (I'm mentioning this in case this can leave a hint for the next one).
I cannot run rviz, the process simply closes after running rosrun rviz rviz. I'm on Diamondback, Maverick, running AMD Sempron 3100+ processor and a nVidia Corporation C51G [GeForce 6100] (rev a2) graphics card.
I created a launchfile to run rviz with GDB, and here is what I'm getting. Any clues?

A:

I found the solution after reading this. I simply switched to an older driver after reading dmesg messages saying something about /usr/lib/libnvidia-glcore.so.260.19.12 segmentation fault issues.

Unfortunately there is the same problem with libnvidia-glcore.so.270.29 on my machine. Switching back to 173... This must be a 10.10 vs NVidia issue, as I didn't have any problems on 10.04. Or they compiled their drivers with SSE3 recently :).

These are the directions I used: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/06/how-to-install-nvidia-25635-display.html (note that they are a bit out of date on which versions are available, but the directions are the same). There are also some details on switching back and forth by purging the PPA to downgrade.

newbie question: how do you switch between different nvidia drivers in ubuntu?
Comment by Eric Perko on 2011-03-15:
Can you update to the 270 series of drivers? I've been running 270.29 on Ubuntu 10.10 and haven't had problems.
