Isn't that speech recognition:) ? Or you wanted to learn about natural language processing?
Comment by feixiao on 2015-08-03:
i wanna know if someone has already embedded natural language processing in some package,so that we can use these package directly

A:

There is a wrapper for the voice recognition phinx: http://wiki.ros.org/pocketsphinx
and Google Speech http://wiki.ros.org/gspeech and another one here: http://rospeex.org/top/

Update:
So you need a chat bot, I guess:
