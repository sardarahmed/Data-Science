Q:

Indexing Metapackage wiki.ros.org

Hi,
I read the tutorial on indexing of the packages (http://wiki.ros.org/rosdistro/Tutorials/Indexing%20Your%20ROS%20Repository%20for%20Documentation%20Generation)
If I release a metapackage do I have to create a wiki page for every package within by hand or will this be done automatically?

A:

Wiki pages are never created automatically. You have to create them manually.
