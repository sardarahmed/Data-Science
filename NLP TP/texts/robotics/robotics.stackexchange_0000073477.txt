Q:

Error Kinetic install on Ubuntu 16.04

Hello!
I try to install Ros kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 with the next step:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 0xB01FA116
sudo apt-get update

But when I introuce the last step:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full 

I received the next:
E: unable to locate package ros-indigo-desktop-full

Some idea?
Thank you very much and regards!
Andres.

It is now July....I am having this problem. Linking to new question might be dupe, but in moderation limbo don't want to forget this question exists ;) http://answers.ros.org/question/239491/installing-ros-kinetic-on-ubuntu-1604-apt-get-update-fail/

A:

Well, the OP is a bit confusing: the command is to install Kinetic, but the error message mentions Indigo.
