Q:

Kinect - no devices connected on openni_node.launch

Hi all, I'm starting with the turtlebot but can't get the Kinect to be recognized. I am runnig diamondback.
I redid sudo apt-get install openni_kinect just to make sure it was there, but didn't solve the problem.
Output of lsusb:

Hi,
lsusb should give 3 devices of Microsoft as below.
Bus 002 Device 009: ID 045e:02ae Microsoft Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 008: ID 045e:02ad Microsoft Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 007: ID 045e:02b0 Microsoft Corp. 

I mean this is not w r t turtlebot, but in general when connecting Kinect using external power supply. When its disconnected from external supply it gives the one device as in your case.
Thanks,
Karthik

Thanks I needed to set the mode to Full in the turtlebot dashboard in order to power up the Kinect.
