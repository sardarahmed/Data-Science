Q:

Will ROS able to support linux mint in the future?

I know that linux mint 12 is based on ubuntu 11.10, so it can install ros-fuerte ( I have tried to install it).
Is ROS can always support linux mint for later update?
Thank you~

A:

Mint is "experimental". I doubt it will ever be officially "supported".
How well "experimental" platforms work depends on whether they have an active user community contributing fixes for rosdep and other issues. People have reported various problems with Mint. I can't tell how well they have been resolved.
