Q:

How to install eband_local_planner?

Hi all,
I would appreciate it if someone can guide me on how to install eband_local_planner for use with move_base on Hydro because every approach that I have tried so far, has failed.
Thanks

I installed eband_local_planner by using the following commands:
rosws set eband_local_planner https://github.com/utexas-bwi/eband_local_planner --git
rosws eband_local_planner
roscd eband_local_planner
rosmake 

Running the command rospack plugins --attrib=plugin nav_core shows eband_local_planner loaded as a plugin but the eband_local_planner is installed in /home/powerbot67/ros/eband_local_planner/elp_plugin.xml
while the rest of the plugins are installed in /opt/ros/hydro/share. Could this be a problem?
powerbot67@powerbot67-desktop:~$ printenv | grep ROS
ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/powerbot67/ros/sbpl_lattice_planner:/home/powerbot67/ros/eband_local_planner:/home/powerbot67/hydro/sandbox:/opt/ros:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
ROS_WORKSPACE=/home/powerbot67/ros
ROSLISP_PACKAGE_DIRECTORIES=
ROS_DISTRO=hydro
ROS_ETC_DIR=/opt/ros/hydro/etc/ros

I changed the move_base.launch file to use eband_local planner as follows:
<arg name="base_local_planner" default="eband_local_planner/EBandPlannerROS"/>

However, when I run move_base, I get the following error:

[FATAL] [1455878479.341080841]: Failed

log file:
/home/powerbot67/.ros/log/e58dae7e-d6f1-11e5-a32e-00026f87bbb1/move_base-1*.log

Also, running roswtf gives the following:
ERROR Not all paths in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH [/home/powerbot67/ros/sbpl_lattice_planner:/home/powerbot67/ros/eband_local_planner:/home/powerbot67/hydro/sandbox:/opt/ros:/opt/ros/hydro/share:/opt/ros/hydro/stacks] point to an existing directory: 
 * /home/powerbot67/ros/sbpl_lattice_planner

What should I do to solve this?
Thanks

ros version?
Comment by DanThe on 2016-02-19:
ROS version is Hydro
Comment by ahendrix on 2016-02-24:
it looks like eband_local_planner is a catkin package. Why are you trying to build it with rosmake?
Comment by DanThe on 2016-02-24:
I am not sure when to use rosmake but your answer to my other question installed eband_local_planner successfully. Thanks

A:

eband_local_planner is marked as "released" on its wiki page. This means that you should be able to install it from debs with:
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-eband-local-planner
