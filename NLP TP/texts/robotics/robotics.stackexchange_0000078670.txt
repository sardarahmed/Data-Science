Q:

Easy Access to robot poses created using the MoveIt! Setup Assistant

Consider that I have set 3 different poses for my robot with different names and different joint values.
Now while using the MoveIt Setup Assistant I can add the 3 poses under the tab Robot Posesand click the button MoveIt! at the bottom of the Setup Assistant screen to see the robot change the poses.
I want to know how I can easily switch between the 3 poses when I am using the move_group_interface and the RViz plugin.

A:

Those poses are called named targets.
Using them in C++: moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroup::setNamedTarget(const std::string &name).
In the RViz planning plugin: select them from the drop-down under Select Goal State on the Planning tab.

Is there a way to do the same thing with Python?

I believe it was added in ros-planning/moveit#1300.
