Q:

Can no longer run rviz

Something happened and I can no longer run rviz.  I get the following when I try to run it:
$ rosrun rviz rviz
find: invalid predicate `-L'
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named rviz below /opt/ros/electric/stacks/visualization/rviz
find: invalid predicate `-H'
$ ls -l /opt/ros/electric/stacks/visualization/rviz/bin
total 4236
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1207114 Feb  6 14:22 image_view
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       763727 Feb  6 14:22 marker_test
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1115605 Feb  6 14:22 rviz
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       398799 Feb  6 14:22 send_grid_cells
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       324022 Feb  6 14:22 send_images
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       515215 Feb  6 14:22 send_lots_of_points

Any ideas?

I am able to run rviz directly by running:  /opt/ros/electric/stacks/visualization/rviz/bin/rviz

A:

It looks like your version of find changed.  -L and -H are top level options on my man page for find.
