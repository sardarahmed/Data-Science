Q:

rosmake sbpl_interface - problem with missing dependency

Hello,
I would be happy for any commentary or answer.
If I expressed myself unclear, please tell me.
Background: the package sbpl_interface requires the collision_distance_field-package as a dependency.
Approach: The package collision_distance_fieldis located inside of the moveit_core package.
Due there is a package.xml file in it I put the whole MoveIt!_source-folder in my catkin_worspace under /src.
After catkin_make was successful, the package collision_distance_field is still missing:
faps@faps-Aspire-5740D:~/catkin_ws/src$ rosmake sbpl_interface
  .................

    Look above for errors from rospack itself.  Aborting.  Please fix the
    broken dependency!

Info: rosdep update also fails.
Questions:

How can I fix the missing dependency?

I've allready installed
MoveIt!-Full via sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-moveit-full, shouldn't moveit_core with all contained packages already be installed?

Many Thanks in advance
rosrookie

Hi rosrookie,
Thanks for giving MoveIt! a try. Unfortunately, sbpl_interface has not been fully ported to the latest version of MoveIt! yet which is why its not working. The authors are working on updating it right now and we'll let you know as soon as its fully up and running.
