Q:

ROS version on RPi 2

Hi! I would like to install from http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Debian ROS Indigo Desktop version for a Raspberry Pi 2: is it possible? Because I installed this version but during installation the RPI 2 was on standby and at the end of the process if I type "$ rosversion -d" I get "<unknown>", and I have to re-key "$ source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash".
I have to repeat the installation? Or I can fix that already done? Thank you!

A:

Hi!
On raspberry pi 2 with raspbian, you should follow the arm installation:
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/UbuntuARM
and you can't have the desktop version, because all package haven't be build for arm processor.
You can check package availability here:
