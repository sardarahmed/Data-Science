Q:

Resource not found error on running move_group.launch

Dear all,
On launch the move_group.launch, following error comes up:
raise ResourceNotFound(name, ros_paths=self._ros_paths)
ResourceNotFound: [cool1000_moveit_config]
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/hydro/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/asimov3/Ros/cool1000_ros_experimental/src
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/hydro/share
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/hydro/stacks"

I have checked the launch file commands and ensured that the files which the commands are looking for exists. Identified that the error is thrown from this line:
  <!-- Trajectory Execution Functionality -->
  <include ns="move_group" file="$(find cool1000_moveit_config)/launch/trajectory_execution.launch.xml" if="$(arg allow_trajectory_execution)">
    <arg name="moveit_manage_controllers" value="true" />
    <arg name="moveit_controller_manager" value="cool1000" unless="$(arg fake_execution)"/>
    <arg name="moveit_controller_manager" value="fake" if="$(arg fake_execution)"/>
  </include>

Could anyone help me out with removing this error?
Revised finding:
On tracing the error I see that its generated from this file: trajectory_execution.launch.xml from the following line:
  <!-- Load the robot specific controller manager; this sets the moveit_controller_manager ROS parameter -->
  <arg name="moveit_controller_manager" default="cool1000" />
  <include file="$(find cool1000_moveit_config)/launch/$(arg moveit_controller_manager)_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml"/>

And further tracing lead me here in cool1000_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml:
<launch>
      <arg name="moveit_controller_manager"
       default="moveit_simple_controller_manager/MoveItSimpleControllerManager"/>
  <param name="moveit_controller_manager"
         value="$(arg moveit_controller_manager)"/>

  <rosparam file="$(find [cool1000_moveit_config])/config/controllers.yaml"/>

</launch>

Here the controllers.yaml file is inside the config folder. Then where should the problem come from?

Can you add the output of rospack find cool1000_moveit_config, run in the same terminal as where you try to launch move_group.launch?

asimov3@asimov3:~/Ros/cool1000_ros_experimental$ rospack find cool1000_moveit_config
/home/asimov3/Ros/cool1000_ros_experimental/src/cool1000_moveit_config

Make sure you have no typos in your launch file. Other than that, this should work. You could try a rospack profile and try again (I doubt that will change anything though, as the rospack find .. command already worked).

Hi gvdhoorn, thanks for your reply, I rechecked it and dint find any typos. However got a bit in detail. But still stuck. Have updated the question with the revised findings. Do you find any problem till here that would cause the error.

For future questions: please format console copy/pastes and source code (such as these launch file excerpts) using the preformatted text button (the one with 101010 on it).

A:

And further tracing lead me here in cool1000_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml:

<launch>
  ..
  <rosparam file="$(find [cool1000_moveit_config])/config/controllers.yaml" />
</launch>

If that is really what is there, then you should remove the square brackets ([ and ]). They should not be there, unless the folder is really named [cool1000_moveit_config], so the name does include the square brackets).
