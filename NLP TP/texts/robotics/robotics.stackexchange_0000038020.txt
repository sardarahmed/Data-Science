Q:

roscreate-qt-pkg and Eclipse

I have created a ROS-Qt package with the command
rosrun qt_create roscreate-qt-pkg mypackage

and am able to compile it with rosmake and run it. In order to edit the project in  Eclipse I have run:
make eclipse-project

but that results in Eclipse not knowing about Qt. Who can help me to get this working?
Regards,
Frits
