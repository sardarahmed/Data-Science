Q:

How to build and run the pub sub tutorial in rosjava?

Hello guys,
i have a problem to run the pubsub tutorial project in rosjava. I build rosjava_core successfully and followed this tutorial http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/getting_started.html but the step "Executing nodes" doesn't work for me unfortunatelly. The build process (../gradlew installApp) runs without any errors (only a warning "bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 1.6") but there is no path "/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub" in directory build. Even the executable nodes (Talker and Listener) cannot be found anywhere in the project. Maybe the tutorial isn't up to date here?
thanks

A:

I also ran into the same problem and think there is an error in the tutorial.  To execute the example, I had to change:

./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker &
./build/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.rosjava_tutorial_pubsub.Listener

to:

./build/install/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.sjava_tutorial_pubsub.Talker &
./build/install/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub/bin/rosjava_tutorial_pubsub org.ros.sjava_tutorial_pubsub.Listener
