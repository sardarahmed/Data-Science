Q:

groovy Catkin_make Error: could not find package configuration file

I have recently shifted from electric to groovy, and am still getting acclimated to the catkin build system. Whilst trying to catkin_make a package using the laser_assembler and laser_filter packages; catkin complains that cmake couldnt find the config files. Upon checking the folder of the packages, I found that these were using the older rosbuild system. I would appreciate some help in solving this... thank you!
heres the output:

  "laser_filters" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it

A:

laser_filters is still using rosbuild and has not yet been migrated to catkin. Therefore you can not depend on that package from within a catkin package. Dependencies can only go from rosbuild to catkin - not the other way around.
You could poke the maintainer of laser_filters to migrate to catkin rather sooner than later. Until that has happened you can only use it from other rosbuild packages.
