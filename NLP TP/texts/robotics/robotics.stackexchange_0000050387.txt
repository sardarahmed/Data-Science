Q:

Kinect not recognized with openni.launch

Hello,
I am currently using two different computers to work with my robot, both of them are on ROS Groovy.
I tried to use the Kinect with those computers using "roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch", but it works on one of the computers but not the other one. The only difference between the two computers is that I did some updates on the one that is not working well.
The error message I get is : "No device connected"
I read some other questions about this problem, so my Kinect is connected on a USB 2.0, and I tried "rmmod -f gspca_kinect" but it's not working.
I read those questions :

http://answers.ros.org/question/60576/microsoft-kinect-not-connected/
But it seems that nobody found a solution to the problem for the moment.

Have you installed the old NITE 1.5.2 ? You should first use the ./uninstall, then the ./install.
Which Ubuntu are you on ? If 12.10, USB 3.0 is not a problem, otherwise it is.

A:

The solution was to reinstall PrimeSense Sensor :
the explanation was given here http://answers.ros.org/question/60562/ubuntu-12042-and-openni_launch-not-detecting-kinect-after-update/
As for djtubig-malicex in this post, I had the same version but it was not working, in the version in the link given it works.
