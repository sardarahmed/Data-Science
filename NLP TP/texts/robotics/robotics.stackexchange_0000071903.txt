Q:

Modifying the Turtlebot Follower

I am new to ROS and I am currently trying to figure out how to modify the built in follower demo. I modified the cpp file but can not figure out how to build the workspace. I have looked around for an answer but have not yet found one.
When I run catkin_make it returns
"The specified source space "/home/bsuwirjo/turtlebotCode/turtlebot_apps-indigo/src" does not exist".
When I try rosmake it returns
[ rosmake ] rosmake starting...
[ rosmake ] No package or stack specified.  And current directory 'turtlebot_apps-indigo' is not a package name or stack name.
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: []
[ rosmake ] Logging to directory /home/bsuwirjo/.ros/rosmake/rosmake_output-20160204-175201
[ rosmake ] Expanded args [] to:
[]
[ rosmake ] ERROR: No arguments could be parsed into valid package or stack names.
Is it something I'm doing wrong regarding the commands?
Thanks

A:

I think you don't have "src" folder.
All packages are situated here:

/home/bsuwirjo/turtlebotCode/turtlebot_apps-indigo/src/turtlebot_apps/

For instance, path to the turtlebot_follower:

/home/bsuwirjo/turtlebotCode/turtlebot_apps-indigo/src/turtlebot_apps/turtlebot_follower

You run "catkin_make" here:

/home/bsuwirjo/turtlebotCode/turtlebot_apps-indigo/

I downloaded the turtlebot apps folder right off of github and it didn't come with the file structure you mentioned above. Would I have to create them manually? or create a new workspace and copy the turtlebot apps folder into the src directory.

Yes, you should create a workspace and copy turtlebot_apps folder into the src directory. (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage).

I am now able to build it successfully,however my changes are not being processes. I modified follower.cpp in the src directory and when I catkin_make it is able to detect the changes. However when I run the follower after sourcing, it doesn't change anything. Do you know what the proble is?
