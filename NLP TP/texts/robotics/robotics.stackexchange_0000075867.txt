Q:

Help with setting up Kinect

Hi,
I am new to the ROS Community and am trying to connect a Kinect camera with ROS for my current project. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and the ROS indigo distribution.
So far, I have followed the tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/evarobot/Tutorials/indigo/Kinect. However towards the end of the tutorial, after the step roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch, I get a the following warnings:
----------
[ WARN] [1471581084.378448573]: Camera calibration file /home/fday562/.ros/camera_info/rgb_B00364629578138B.yaml not found.
[ WARN] [1471581084.378476614]: Using default parameters for RGB camera calibration.
[ WARN] [1471581084.378506677]: Camera calibration file /home/fday562/.ros/camera_info/depth_B00364629578138B.yaml not found.
[ WARN] [1471581084.378520480]: Using default parameters for IR camera calibration.
----------

Everything else works fine. Earlier I was trying to use usb_cam and it threw similar warnings. Any idea whats this about? Any help is appreciated.
Thanks :)

A:

I had the same problem with my ASUS Xtion Pro Live camera, and answered my own question here:

I used this http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch/Tutorials/IntrinsicCalibration calibration to generate those files.
