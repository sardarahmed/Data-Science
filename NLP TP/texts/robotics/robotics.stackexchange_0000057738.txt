Q:

how to specify test packge in `catkin_make test`

can we choose package to be tested? currently catkin_make test tests all test code under src directory, but I'd like to check only specific packages, in order to save time.

A:

The test target is CTest, you can read the CTest documentation if you want to use that target.
catkin provides the run_tests target which runs all the tests. You can tab complete run_tests_ to get a target for each test you have registered which only runs that test.

thank you, that is the perfect answer!

Another question, make run_tests_* exits with 0 even if the test failed. Is it expected behavior? is there a way to catch if the test failed?
