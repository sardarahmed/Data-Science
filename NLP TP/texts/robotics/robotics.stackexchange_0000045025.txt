Q:

No registered depth image in Fuerte

I am using the /camera/depth_registered/image_rect message from a kinect using openni_launch, but he message is not sent in Fuerte. I tried setting depth_registration:
roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch depth_registration:=true

but still no registered depth image. In Electric everything works fine. Do I have to do something more to turn om the registered depth images in Fuerte?

Do you get any data on other published topics?
Comment by Ola Ringdahl on 2012-10-18:
Yes, /camera/depth_registered/image_raw works for example. The RGB images are also published as they should.

A:

Now it works, but I have no idea why :-(
I re-installed openni and switched USB port for the camera. Now it works regardless of USB port used, so it could be that openni was broken somehow...
