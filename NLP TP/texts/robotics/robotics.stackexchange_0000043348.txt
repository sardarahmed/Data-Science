Q:

rosws update turtlebot

When I try to do the command "rosws update turtlebot", in tutorial : http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Overlays, I receive this message:
File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/vcstools/common.py", line 141, in run_shell_command
>stdout = "\n".join(stdout_buf)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 14: ordinal not in range(128)
Exception caught during install: Error processing 'turtlebot' : 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 14: ordinal not in range(128)
Someone could help me?

A:

That's a bug, apparently, I registered it here:
https://kforge.ros.org/vcstools/trac/ticket/64
I will investigate.
In your case,
rosws update turtlebot

is just a shortcut for:
 hg clone https://kforge.ros.org/turtlebot/turtlebot

so you can do that and then continue the installation
