Q:

Moveit2 Octomap Setup

I cannot figure out how to get an octomap to show up in moveit2. I can pass a sensors_3d.yaml as parameters to the move_group and without a transform from the camera to the robot and the move group will come up with errors saying there is no transform link between the two. No octomap displays in rviz2 however and the planning scene topics does not have anything publishing.
I am unable to run the octomap server manually so far.
move group output when parameters for sensor passed to move group without transform
    [move_group-4] [WARN] [1634575155.847092398] [moveit_ros.planning_scene_monitor.planning_scene_monitor]: Unable to transform object from frame 'camera_link' to planning frame'base_link' (Could not find a connection between 'base_link' and 'camera_link' because they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnected trees.)
