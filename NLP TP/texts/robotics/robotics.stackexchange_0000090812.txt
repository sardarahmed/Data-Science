Q:

rospy tf get frame_id of trans, rot

Hey there,
Assume I have three tf's:
1): marker_1 relative to world
2): marker_2 relative to world
3):  marker_3 relative to world
Now I want to get the marker name that is closest to marker_1. Is there a direct function in rospy to get this or do I have to iterate over all frame_id of the tf and thereby find it out?
Thanks :)

To the best of my knowledge you'll have to make this function yourself. This is not the primary purpose of the TF system

A:

Pete's comment should have been an answer, so just to take this out of the Unanswered queue: No, you'll have to iterate through them and check the distances yourself.
Note that you can use the tf2 (and tf) data types to calculate the distance and save yourself a little bit of conversion trouble. See here.
