A:

If you installed it using apt-get you probably don't have the source code and just grabbed the pre-compiled binaries.
Best thing is to go to gazebo's repository and clone it to your computer then do a text search for those functions. I think the search function you would need would be
grep -rnw yourFunctionHere

on the root folder of the repository. Believe it or not BitBucket doesn't offer a search function yet !!!
