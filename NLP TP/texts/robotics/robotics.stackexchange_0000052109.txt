Q:

SLAM motion and measurement models

Hi
I would like to implement SLAM with the Kinect for a research project. I am not sure which motion and measurement models to apply though. Would anyone be able to recommend which models I can apply to the Kinect or a good place to start. I will be using ROS. Thank you

Hi, I just did a similar project last semester. The motion will depend on the robot you are using. For the measurement model we extracted lines from the cloud of points and registered the robot with them.

Thank you, is there a link where I could look at the models you used? (I know they are probably complex to type out) Thanks
