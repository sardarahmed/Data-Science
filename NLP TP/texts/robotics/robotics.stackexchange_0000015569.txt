Q:

How to use tensor flow on arduino robot

I'm in the process of learning Tensor Flow, and I really want to use it on a new robot I'm going to build. I want the robot to be able to do image recognition, and move towards an image of interest, or follow a path, using neural networks. Is this even possible with tensor flow?
Is the Arduino capable of running neural network frameworks, such as Tensor Flow?
Thanks.

A:

The Arduino is a microcontroller and not a "full" computer.  (See my other answer here.) As such, you will have a difficult time running TensorFlow on the Arduino.
Deploying TensorFlow, or another Neural Network Framework, on your robot has at least two parts:

Training: teaching your network, best performed on a computer or server with a powerful GPU
Deployment: loading your trained model onto your platform for realtime operation.

You would have an easier time training on a desktop computer and deploying to a robotic platform that uses a Raspberry Pi for high-level tasks and an Arduino for low-level tasks.  On the Pi, you could use TensorFlow or OpenCV in either C/C++ or Python.
Depending on your objectives, you may be able to get away with using specialized camera hardware like the Pixy, which would work directly with the Arduino.
