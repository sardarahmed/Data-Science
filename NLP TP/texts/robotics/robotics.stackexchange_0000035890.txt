Q:

rosrun rviz rviz -> Segmentation fault

I've been told that my error is different from the post where I have originally asked this questions. Since I still have this problem I would like to ask for help in this topic then. When I try to run rviz "Segmentation fault" error. I'm using 10.4 (running on vmware) and electric:
user@ubuntu:~/.rviz$ rosrun rviz rviz
[ INFO] [1321935622.778521758]: rviz revision number 1.6.6

Segmentation fault

I tried to remove lines in display_config - it didn't help. I removed both configs and got the same results. I was trying to restart workstation and turtlebot but it didn't help either. One or two times I had different error which actually did come up here as well:
user@ubuntu:~/.rviz$ rosrun rviz rviz -d 'rospack find turtlebot_interactive_markers'/config/interactive_markers.vcg 
[ INFO] [1321935611.525499608]: rviz revision number 1.6.6
[ INFO] [1321935611.525703015]: ogre_tools revision number 1.6.2

[ INFO] [1321935611.700409981]: RTT Preferred Mode is PBuffer.
The program 'rviz' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 21 error_code 9 request_code 55 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

Any ideas (other than remove files)? Thanks.

Yeah but this doesn't even work on my machine natively (it has an Intel GMA945)
Comment by Roman Burdakov on 2011-11-23:
I've run glxinfo and it has "direct rendering: Yes". Does anyone else has tried to run rviz on VMWare? Is this a problem?
Comment by dornhege on 2011-11-22:
A minimal test is the output of glxinfo. It should say: direct rendering: Yes
VirtualBox has experimental 3D support, I don't know about VM (and if rviz works in virtualbox).
Comment by Roman Burdakov on 2011-11-22:
Is there a way to test it and find out if this is the case?
Comment by dornhege on 2011-11-22:
3D support for virtual machines is quite limited and rviz uses Ogre. Maybe, it just won't work.
Comment by Roman Burdakov on 2011-11-22:
Yes. Does it make any difference? Let me include this in the question.
Comment by dornhege on 2011-11-22:
Are you running in a virtual machine?

A:

I can't get rviz to run reliably in a Parallels or VirtualBox VM. It definitely seems to be Ogre-related. I think you might be out of luck. :(

I've installed ogre separately and didn't have any problems with it. I'm running vmware with 2 cores and 2 gb of memory for it but I'm not getting even close to 100% utilization or memory usage. Ubuntu is 10.4. Not sure what else I can check.
