i am using Ubuntu 11.10 in a virtual machine,i was told also that it my be because of the version of ROS(it still doesnt have support for the last version of ROS),so that i should use ROS Electric.i am a beginner at ROS,so the most recent version of ROS is the fuerte?and i should chance to Electric and that would fix the problem then?? or it doesnt have to to with the version?
