A:

Yes, the packages in ROS-Industrial can be installed on ROS Indigo.
At present (2015-04-22) the industrial_core, abb and universal_robot packages have been officially released and can be installed using sudo apt-get install ...
The fanuc and motoman packages have not yet been released, but can be build from source. The Indigo page for fanuc_driver lists the steps required to do that. The same steps can be used for the motoman packages, see How can I use Motoman stack with ROS Indigo? for more info.
The ros-industrial-DISTRO-desktop package has not been released into Indigo yet, so that is why you cannot install it using apt-get.
