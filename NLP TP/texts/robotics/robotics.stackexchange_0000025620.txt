Q:

Error loading SDF in Gazebo 1.3.1

I'm trying to load a simple SDF in Gazebo and I'm getting an error.
I'm running Gazebo 1.3.1.
The SDF is copied straight from a tutorial. The code is:
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<sdf version='1.3'>
  <model name="my_robot">
     <static>true</static>
       <link name='chassis'>
        <pose>0 0 .1 0 0 0</pose>

        <collision name='collision'>
          <geometry>
            <box>
              <size>.4 .2 .1</size>
            </box>
          </geometry>
        </collision>

        <visual name='visual'>
          <geometry>
            <box>
              <size>.4 .2 .1</size>
            </box>
          </geometry>
        </visual>
      </link>
  </model>
</sdf>

I tried to launch it using:
gzfactory spawn -f model3.sdf

The error I'm getting is this:
Error [SDF.cc:984] Unable to find value for key[origin]
Error [SDF.cc:738] Missing element description for [origin]
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Someone else posted about this error here.  It was said to be fixed in the bug report, but I don't think it was.
Is there a fix for this? Is there a better way to spawn an SDF?
Verdict: Probably a bug.  Filed here . Workaround: Follow the directions given in the answer below or equivalently in the Gazebo Handbook.

Perhaps upvoting the question will get it more attention from the admins. (And a solution is given below by Andrei).

A:

I had the same problem :).
The workaround I used, I copied all my models into ~/.gazebo/models folder. Then you can either spawn them from gazebo. Or by adding these lines to the .world file:
<world>
...
    <include>
        <uri>model://my_robot</uri>
        <pose>0.3 0.5 0.9 0 0 0</pose>
    </include>
</world>

It is weird they still haven't fixed this bug. It is not very portable having the models in that folder.
