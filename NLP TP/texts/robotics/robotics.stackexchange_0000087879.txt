Q:

How to check for free cells in a line in the costmap?

Hello,
What I want to do is something similar to a raycast. From a specific position draw a line and get the list of all the free cells in that line. The line has a maximum length, but it has to stop if it reach an obstacle.
Is there an existing API for that? Or I need to implement it myself?
Thanks!

A:

In the end I solved it by implementing a new layer on the costmap and using this:
