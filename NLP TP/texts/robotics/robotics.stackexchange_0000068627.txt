Q:

roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch not working

Hi!
I followed the instructions for installing the turtlebot and everything seemed to be working fine!
However, when I try to start the connection with turtlebot I get following output:
...
started core service [/rosout]
process[robot_state_publisher-2]: started with pid [24237]

/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/bondpy/bondpy.py:114: SyntaxWarning: The publisher should be created with an explicit keyword argument 'queue_size'. Please see http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers for more information.

  self.pub = rospy.Publisher(self.topic, Status)

The difference with this output to the instructions is that after the line:
process[master-11]: started with pid [24513]
is, that I am not getting an ERROR: cannot launch node of type...
Does anyone have an idea what's wrong?
Thanks in advance!

Can you please format console copy/pastes with the Preformatted text button from the toolbar? It's the one with 101010 on it. Otherwise this is unreadable. Thanks.

Have you change anything in the code or creating your own python nodes? The problem is relatively simple. Somewhere a publisher is being created something like pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String) but it has to contain also queue_size=10 or any other number in the parameters.

thanks for the help! @gvdhoorn: yes I will the next time, sorry. There seemed to be a problem with the Kobuki base driver but now it is working. Thanks!

Could you please reply to your own answer giving a bit more detail on what failed and did you fix it? It could be useful for other users.

@gvdhoorn
Could you let me know detailedly how you solved this problem? I met the same one. Thanks very much!
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2015-07-17:
I did not solve this (it was also not my question, but @Salocin808's). Did you install the driver for the base, as @Salocin808 mentioned in his answer?

A:

Sorry for the late reply! The solution was simple because I simply forgot to install the driver for the Kobuki base:
