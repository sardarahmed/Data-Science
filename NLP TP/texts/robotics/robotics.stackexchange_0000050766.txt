Q:

problem with distributed ROS (swarm of ardrones)

Hello everyone. I'm having issues with the control of 3 ardrones, each one connected to its laptop, where one of these laptos is configured as the master.
The network is configured properly.
The first problem occured with 2 drones. When flying togheter, I kept getting the following error "Reconnecting ... Reconnecting ... Timeout when reading navdatas - resending a navdata request on port 5554"
So I firstly switched from the 200 hz of the navdata msgs sent from the drone to 15 hz,
and I set the drone driver loop from 50 to 20. The two drones where then able to fly togheter.
When I added the third, unfortunately, the error reappeared.
In my nodes I write on a custom topic the informations relative to each drone (I send them each 300 ms), I have 2 loops repeating at 200 and 100 ms, and on each laptop two nodes for marker detection (ar_track_alvar package)
Does anyone have an idea of how to make the system work robustly with 3 drones?
Thank you!

A:

just realised that was wifi's fault. All the 3 drones are using the same channel. I have not find a way to make each drone select a different channel, though.
