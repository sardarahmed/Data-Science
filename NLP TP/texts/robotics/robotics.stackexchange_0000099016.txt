Q:

How can I process rostopic on a remote pc host?

Hello,
I am using ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.
My question is, how can I process topic data on a remote pc. I have a robot connected to a local network. I can see the ros topics on the remote pc using SSH. For my application, the ROS master must run on the robot, not the host. I have tried writing a text file inside robot memory and reading it on a remote pc, but this method is slow and does not seem to be correct. Can anyone help me through this? How can I transfer data (Like a simple Integer) to a host in Ubuntu?

A:

Hi, navidzarrabi
run export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.XXX.XXX.XXX:11311 and export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.XXX.XXX.XXX on your
robot,192.XXX.XXX.XXX is your robot ip address.
run export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.XXX.XXX.XXX:11311 and export ROS_HOSTNAME=192.YYY.YYY.YYY on your PC
192.XXX.XXX.XXX is your robot ip address, 192.YYY.YYY.YYY is your PC ip address.
then, you can do most operations on your pc. such as rviz, rqt_gui.
In fact, i think this makes your pc know where is master and makes your robot know where is itself.It works for me, i hope it works for you,too.
