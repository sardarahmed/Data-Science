A:

You may need to download the code and change this line, then build your own RViz:
https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/blob/melodic-devel/src/rviz/default_plugin/tf_display.cpp#L570
frame->axes_->setToDefaultColors();
frame->name_text_->setColor(Ogre::ColourValue::White); // <--
frame->parent_arrow_->setHeadColor(ARROW_HEAD_COLOR);
frame->parent_arrow_->setShaftColor(ARROW_SHAFT_COLOR);

Line number can be different based on your ROS distro. You'll be needing the version of source code that was used to supply your distro's binaries.

I downloaded it for kinetic from here and put it on my /catkin_ws/src/ and used catkin_make, it built successfully....>[100%] Built target rviz_default_plugin
but I don't know how to launch it.
@Orhan, please help me.
I used "rosrun rviz rviz" but it is the same befor.

Try entering roscd rviz command. If it brings you to /opt/ros/kinetic/share/rviz, then something is wrong with your terminal environment. Try re-sourcing your workspace after deleting build, devel, install folders and building back. e.g. source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

I changed this line from
frame->name_text_->setColor(Ogre::ColourValue::White);
to
frame->name_text_->setColor(Ogre::ColourValue::Black);
then used
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
It works fine, thank you so much for your help @Orhan .
Note: all this modification is in the workstation part, not is in the robot part.

@Orhan what about color of arrows which joint two frames, you can see it yellow color, right?.
Can I change it to another color for example black or red?
Comment by Orhan on 2020-07-15:
I didn't check the source code or the rviz gui for that. But if you believe in yourself, you can find it in the source code in case there's no option in rviz.
