Q:

ros nodes not shutting down

i have a launch file which first launch another launch file and then it starts another node. When my another node terminates I expect nodes started by first launch file should also terminate. So I have
 while (ros::ok()) 

in my first launch node so if my second node finishes, i want to terminate first node. but right now on console I get

"escalating to SIGTERM"

. How do I fix this issue?

Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-09-08:
Nodes not shutting down is typically caused by either not checking ros::ok() or not having a proper ros::Rate::sleep() somewhere in your while loop. The first is probably not the case, but do please check the second.

A:

That's not how it works.
If a node "finishes" its execution, the other nodes could still keep spinning.
A node is killed when its node handler goes out of scope or when ros::shutdown() is called.
You can find a detailed description of initialization and shutdown here http://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Initialization%20and%20Shutdown
