Q:

Invisible Collision Ocject

Hello, everyone.
I  want to add the BOX in the world, and added the box(by getKnownObjectNames())
But, they are invisible, so I can see they fron RViz2.

Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
ROS2 Humble

Mesh files from xacro/stl is visible... I cannot understand why BOX is invisible.
moveit_msgs::msg::CollisionObject obj;  
obj.header.frame_id = mg->getPlanningFrame();   
obj.id = "BOX";

shape_msgs::msg::SolidPrimitive prim;  
prim.type = shape_msgs::msg::SolidPrimitive::BOX;  
prim.dimensions = {2.0, 2.0, 2.0};     
geometry_msgs::msg::Pose pose;     
pose.position.x = -2.0;  
pose.position.y = -2.0;    
pose.position.z = -2.0;  
pose.orientation.w = 1.0;

obj.primitives.push_back(prim);  
obj.primitive_poses.push_back(pose);  
obj.operation = moveit_msgs::msg::CollisionObject::ADD;

moveit::planning_interface::PlanningSceneInterface ps;  
ps.applyCollisionObject(obj);
