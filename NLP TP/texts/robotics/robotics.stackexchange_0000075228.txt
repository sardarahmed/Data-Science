A:

rviz is just a visualisation tool; it does not simulate anything. The simulator you are most likely running is gazebo and rviz is just visualising the data gazebo produces. To run rviz and moveit connected to the robot, you have to make sure that it communicates with the same roscore as the robot drivers.

Start roscore on the robot
Start the hardware drivers of the robot
Set up your remote machine to communicate with the robot: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines
Start rviz on that remote machine

I hope that helps as a rough guideline. If you need more help, please give a more detailed description of your system set-up and the robot you use.
