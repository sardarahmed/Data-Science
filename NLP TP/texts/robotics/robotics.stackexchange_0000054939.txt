Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: ubuntu 13.10

I have just installed ubuntu 13.10- the newest version but I have read that the newest version of ROS is compatible with 12.04. I haven't presonalised linux yet. Is it a good idea to get 12.04? Will it be also compatible with OpenCv?

A:

Using ROS hydro on Ubuntu 13.10 will require certain Linux skills. If you ask that question, you probably do not have those skills. So you should use an older version of Ubuntu, like 13.04.
