Q:

little problem creating pkgs

Hi, I'm Trying to do something similar like the shadow hand but more easy. (Cause I do'nt need all the things that the shadow's have). in these way the importan things that i need is the next ones for now obviously:

sr_description

sr_hardware_interface

sr_mechanism_model

i'm trying to do my owns : VT_hardware_interface, VT_mechanism_model,VT_description; and all are in one VirtualTouch pkg. i did pkg VT_description run make and was fine and in same way VT_hardware_interface. but when i gonna run the VT_mechanism_model that depends on one files of the VT_hardware i get the next :
> /home/moni/VirtualTouch/VT_mechanism_model/src/joint_0_transmission.cpp:9:49: error fatal: VT_hardware_interface/VT_actuator.hpp: No existe el archivo o el directorio
compilación terminada.
make[3]: *** [CMakeFiles/VT_mechanism_model.dir/src/joint_0_transmission.o] Error 1
make[3]: se sale del directorio «/home/moni/VirtualTouch/VT_mechanism_model/build»
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/VT_mechanism_model.dir/all] Error 2
make[2]: se sale del directorio «/home/moni/VirtualTouch/VT_mechanism_model/build»
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: se sale del directorio «/home/moni/VirtualTouch/VT_mechanism_model/build»
make: *** [all] Error 2

I export the pkg ( source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash AND export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:pwd) on VT_hardware
and doesn't work. some idea what i'm doing wrong?
thnks
EDIT:
When Run :
> echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH 
 

out
> /opt/ros/fuerte/share:/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks:/home/moni/VirtualTouch/VT_mechanism_model

And for rospack find VT_hardware_interface
[rospack] Error: stack/package VT_hardware_interface not found

In The same way i tried with:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/moni/VirtualTouch/VT_mechanism_model:/home/moni/VirtualTouch/VT_hardware_interface 

but it's kind the same error.

What do the echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and rospack find VT_hardware_interface commands print? (Please edit your question to show their output.)

A:

Do not manage your package path manually but use rosws. This page shows how to set up a clean workspace. Put your packages (sr_description, sr_hardware_interface and sr_mechanism_model) in the folder ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox and, given they all provide the correct export lines in manifest.xml, compilation should just work.
Edit It seems like you put your dependencies right into the ros package you were creating. Don't do that. You cannot nest packages in packages, i.e. a package cannot contain another package. Instead, all three packages and your own package should be direct subdirectories of ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox.
A few more things to check:

Check with echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH that you sourced the setup.bash file in ~/fuerte_workspace correctly. It should contain a path to ~/fuerte_workspace/sandbox. If it does not, re-source the setup.bash file in your terminal.

You should be able to find your packages with rospack find, e.g.: rospack find sr_hardware_interface. This call should output the absolute path to the respective package. If it does not, check that the package actually contains a manifest.xml file.

Verify that sr_hardware_interface is actually exporting C++ flags correctly: rospack export sr_hardware_interface --lang=cpp --attrib=cflags This command should print something like -I/home/you/fuerte_workspace/sandbox/sr_hardware_interface/include. If it does not, add the corresponding export lines to the manifest file.

Verify that your package dependencies are right. For instance, the manifest file in VT_mechanism_model needs to depend on sr_hardware_interface. Make sure your dependencies are correct.

I tried this, making like a new Sandbox in my pkg called VirtualTouch doing all of the page u give me, and the erros is the same . i thought that something was wrong with it so i tried copy the files on my really fuerte_workspace/sandbox that a created and utilized for the first tutorials about ros,
