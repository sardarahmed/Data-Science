Q:

How do I set depthimage resolution

Hi,
This must be simple to do, how do I set the resolution of a depthimage? For some reason my xtion is publishing 120x160 pixles. I'm using:
rosrun openni2_camera openni2_camera_node
To start the process (roslaunch isn't working for me unfortunately )
Many Thanks
Mark
