Q:

Build package with system_lib not found

Hello everyone,
 I run catkin_make to build my package with this Warning:

-- +++ processing catkin package: 'katrina_gui'
-- ==> add_subdirectory(katrina_gui)
-- Boost version: 1.58.0
-- Found the following Boost libraries:
--   system
-- Using these message generators: gencpp;geneus;genlisp;gennodejs;genpy
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:166 (message):
  catkin_package() DEPENDS on 'system_lib' but neither
  'system_lib_INCLUDE_DIRS' nor 'system_lib_LIBRARIES' is defined.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkin_package.cmake:102 (_catkin_package)
  katrina_gui/CMakeLists.txt:22 (catkin_package)

My Environment Is:
Ubuntu 16.04 
ROS-Kinetic

I run this package under ROS-Indigo before, how can i fix this?

A:

system_lib is the name used as an example in the template CMakeLists.txt that catkin_create_pkg generates for you.
It is not intended to be an actual package.
Unless you happen to have a system dependency actually called system_lib, I recommend you remove it from your catkin_package(.. DEPENDS ..) list.

I run this package under ROS-Indigo before

I can't be sure, but I'm going to assume that would be impossible. Both Indigo and Kinetic use the same versions of Catkin, so I'd expect the same error to be shown to you.
