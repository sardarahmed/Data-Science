Q:

error launching world file in gazebo

I was following this tutorial, but as i enter: roslaunch my_robot_gazebo my_robot.launch, i cant see the world in gazebo. When i enter: env | grep GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH, i cant see the gazebo in that path, when i checked my gazebo-2.2 was inside usr/share/local instead of /usr/local/share. I am using ros indigo. Befor this i have installed gazebo4 and than again uninstalled it as i knew ros indigo already provides gazebo2.2. Now i am this type of errors, what should i do? I am using ros indigo, ubuntu 14.04. I get this kind of error:
Error [Plugin.hh:149] Failed to load plugin libbaxter_gazebo_ros_control.so: libbaxter_gazebo_ros_control.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

What i see is when ever i run: rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file rospack find baxter_description/urdf/baxter.urdf -urdf -z 1 -model baxter, the gazebo stops running.

that is my question, i posted in both forum, to get answer quickly.

A:

It looks like these packages are not publicly available?

To test gazebo alone, I would try spawning an empty world using the gazebo_ros package.
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch
