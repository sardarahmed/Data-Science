A:

It looks like you do not have all of image_view's dependencies, based on lines like this:
...
Could not find a configuration file for package cv_bridge.
...
Could not find a configuration file for package image_geometry.
...
Could not find a configuration file for package image_transport.
...
Could not find a configuration file for package nodelet.
...
Could not find a configuration file for package stereo_msgs.
...

You should either use rosinstall_generator and wstool to get them from source, which I describe in this answer:
http://answers.ros.org/question/92806/setting-workspace-for-rosws/?answer=92906#post-id-92906
or use rosdep to get them installed from debians:
rosdep install --from-paths ./src --ignore-src --rosdistro groovy -y
