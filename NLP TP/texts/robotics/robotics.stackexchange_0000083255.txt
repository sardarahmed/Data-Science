Q:

Is there a switch that I can stop writing to log file?

I just want to see some debug messages on the screen.
But the debug message is a little heavy to write to log files.   It makes my ros can't run smoothly.
So, I wonder know is there a command that I can stop all log file but have no affect on the screen output.

A:

Probably won't help in the long run, but you can disable rosout in roscore.xml, see 10068
