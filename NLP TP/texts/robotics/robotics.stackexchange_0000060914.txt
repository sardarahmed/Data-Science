Q:

RVIZ *** glibc detected ***

Hi, I am using Hydro with Ubuntu 12.04 and unable to run rviz. I am getting following error when doing $ rosrun rviz rviz:
[ INFO] [1405607287.945120631]: rviz version 1.10.16
[ INFO] [1405607287.945243544]: compiled against OGRE version 1.7.4 (Cthugha) 
[ INFO] [1405607288.233226022]: Stereo is NOT SUPPORTED
[ INFO] [1405607288.233341114]: OpenGl version: 3 (GLSL 1.3).
*** glibc detected *** /home/asif/ROS_CatkinWS_Hydro/devel/lib/rviz/rviz: corrupted double-linked list: 0x00000000020422a0 ***
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 221: dl_open_worker: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args->nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed!

I removed rviz using $ sudo apt-get remove ros-hydro-rviz and tried to re-install using $ sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-rviz and it gave me an error:
E: Unable to locate package ros-hydro-rviz

Then I downloaded the source from github and managed to install it successfully using catkin_make but still getting same  *** glibc detected *** error as above.
Any idea how to solve this problem! Thanks in advance.
PS: I found couple of similar questions asked earlier, for example this and this but did not found a solution.

See the answer in this question where the error msg looks very similar (as you mentioned).
