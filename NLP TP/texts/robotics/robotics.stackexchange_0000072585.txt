Q:

Exploration or navigation

Hi! I used hector slam to make a map of the environment. Now, I want to repeat the map using navigation or exploration. I installed hector_navigation and navigation packages but I don't know if I have to make changes and what commands to give. Can anyone tell me a complete tutorial or give me any information about steps to take? Because I have several launch files and nodes, but I do not know what to use and how to use them. Thank you!

A:

For exploration, you don't even need to create a map in advance.
You can launch hector_slam, the hector_exploration_planner, and the hector_exploration_controller. The result will be simultaneous exploration and mapping.
For navigation, you can use your map with the standard ROS navigation stack. See http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials

Thank you! After hector_slam, I had launch "roslaunch hector_exploration_node exploration_planner.launch" and I had this error: Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: Could not find a connection between 'map' and 'base_link' becaus

...they are not part of the same tree.Tf has two or more unconnected trees.. canTransform returned after 0.102339 timeout was 0.1. And when I type "rosrun hector_exploration_controller simple_exploration_controller" I had: [ WARN] [1457429139.712816935]: Service call for exploration service failed.

What am I doing wrong? What display and what topic should I change in rviz?
