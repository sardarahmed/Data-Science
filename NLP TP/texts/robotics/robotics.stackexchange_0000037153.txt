Q:

Not able to install visualization_common stack

I'm trying to install the visualization_common stack again (removed the old one as the ogre had problems with rviz) using individual stack install
sudo apt-get install ros-electric-visualization-common

But my system is telling me this:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
ros-electric-visualization-common is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.

How do I let the system know that there is no such stack anymore and do a fresh installation?

A:

apt-get install --reinstall ros-electric-visualization-common
Generally, you should remove packages through the package manager (apt-get remove ...) rather than delete the files. Otherwise, you get into cases like this, where the package manager is out of sync with the system.

Thank you! It worked (for rviz as well).
