Q:

Can't use PR2 Navigation Stack

I am trying to follow 'PR2 Navigation Stack Demo' in pr2_simulator/Tutorials/BasicPR2Controls.
Unfortunately, it does not work on my computer (Ubuntu + groovy).

I have done to rosmake every required packages.
When I type 'roslaunch ~/pr2_nav_tutorial.launch', I got the following error messages:

process[interpolate_missing_tilt_laser_data_filter-6]: started with pid [28137]

Despite the error messages,  it constantly generates the following pattern of logs:

So, ignoring the error messages, I typed 'roslaunch pr2_navigation_global rviz_move_base.launch', but the pr2 robot does not appear in rviz. Under Display tap, Status of RobotModel is labeled with Error.

Thanks in advance.

What is being done to launch the PR2? I think these tutorials require the minimal PR2 to be brought up before they can be run.

A:

The errors you're getting indicate that the nodes you're trying to run don't exist; either they aren't built they aren't in a package on your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.
This really looks like you haven't built your packages properly. Are you certain the rosmake process was successful?

I checked the packages by typing 'rospack find':
$ rospack find pr2_navigation_self_filter
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/pr2_navigation/pr2_navigation_self_filter
$ rospack find semantic_point_annotator
/opt/ros/groovy/stacks/pr2_navigation/semantic_point_annotator
Is there something else I should check?

You should look to make sure that the nodes themselves are built in those packages; probably within the bin/ dir of the package. Since your package directories is in /opt/ros/, I assume you've installed pr2_navigation from debs?
