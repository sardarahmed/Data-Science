Q:

Issue in using IMU MPU 6050

Hello, I have been trying to implement MPU 6050 imu sensor using, MPU SERIAL NODE , when i initially run the node, IMU values seem fine, for example, linear accelerations in x, y, z directions come to be ~0 , ~0 , ~ 9.8. orientation values of x,y,z,w seem to be fine as well, w ~ 1 rest ~ 0, However the moment i run my robot using teleop_twist, The values of these variables jump rapidly, i have attached a rosbag file to see how abrupt the jump occurs. also at the same time a warn message in console appears which is
WARN : TF to MSG quaternions not properly normalized !
due to this i am not able to use the robot localization package cause my wheel odometery is not good, i.e laser scans drift over time and amcl cannot match them with given odom. I hope to resolve this issue by sensor fusion.
can any one help to resolve this issue ?

A:

I solved this issue by turning off the Publish tf from odom to baselink in my controller node, since i am using arduino to directly publish velocity values instead of using differential drive controller. I have my own controller.cpp node to do it.
anyway the values don't jump around any more.
