Q:

Odometry calibration for Create

Using ROS Indigo and the create_autonomy package I'm able to control an iRobot Create 2. I would like to calibrate the odometry using a method similar to that used for the Turtlebot - or simpler. Just by moving manually a certain distance and measuring with a measuring tape the robot distance to obtain a correction factor that can then be incorporated into the driver to improve accuracy. Same for angular correction.
I'm aware of http://answers.ros.org/question/232529/moving-base-set-distance-without-navigation-stack/  but would rather measure and enter a linear and angular calibration correction factor for a given floor type that takes care of any inconsistencies. Any help or insight would be appreciated.

A:

From what I can tell, turtlebot_calibration is making use of an active 3D sensor to calibrate angular measurements. I'm not familiar with odometry calibration, but you could start by looking at turtlebot_calibration. You might be able to adapt their code by replacing the scan delta with manual user input for comparison against the odometry. Also, to keep things simple, keep angular calibration separate from linear calibration.
I'd be more than happy to review and integrate any solution you come up with into the package ca_tools.
