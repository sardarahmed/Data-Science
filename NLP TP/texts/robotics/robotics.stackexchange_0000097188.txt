Q:

[ROS2] symbol lookup error and undefined symbol while using image transport cpp

Hi fellow developers,
I am a beginner at ROS2. After building the package and trying to run it I get the following error.
/home/jetson/ros2_ws/install/camera_pkg/lib/camera_pkg/camera_node: symbol lookup error: /home/jetson/ros2_ws/install/camera_pkg/lib/camera_pkg/camera_node: undefined symbol: _ZN15image_transport16create_publisherEPN6rclcpp4NodeERKNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE17rmw_qos_profile_t

Honestly, do not know where to begin to tackle this issue. It seems to me an error with image_transport.h

you may post your Cmakelists.txt as well as package.xml, to me it seems that you are not correctly using find_package() and linking in the Cmakelists.txt. Are finding and linking rclcpp

@atas thank you for willingness to help.

A:

@atas has given me a hint into how to solve the problem. As I was preparing to post the CMakelist, I noticed I had an extra #ament_export_dependencies(.....) below the ament_target_dependencies(.....). This was the cause of the problem. I Just removed the #ament_export_dependencies(.....)
@atas thank you for willingness to help.
