A:

Ubuntu 11.10 is no longer supported by Ubuntu, and isn't supported by ROS Hydro.
You can probably build ROS from source on your ARM board, or attempt to cross-compile it, but I strongly recommend upgrading to a supported version of Ubuntu.
Which version of ROS do you need, and which packages are you planning to use?

You haven't answered either of my questions. Which version of ROS do you need, and which packages are you planning to use?

I ask because it isn't possible to compile some packages (such as PCL) on the smaller ARM boards.

You can install Groovy from source on your board by following the Groovy source installation. meta-ros provides support for cross-compiling ROS, but only supports ROS Hydro
