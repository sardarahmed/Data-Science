Q:

can i detect obstacles with hector_costmap with only laser scanner?

Hi!
I (only) have laser scanner LMS100 and i can create maps from hector_slam without odometry data...but i need to see obstacles / objects in the map.
So i think i should use a costmap like hector_costmap (or costmap_2d which is in another package)...but i don't now if it is usable with just laser data (without odometry data).
update: i tried and managed gmapping with laser scan matcher, so i now i think i can use costmap_2d in navigation stack with help of those...
by the way still dont know, can i use hector_costmap without odometry data?

Hi Basak, may I ask if you managed to hector_costmap for detecting obstacles using just laser data?

A:

Hi,
you could try using this package to estimate odometry data from laserscans.
