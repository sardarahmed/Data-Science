Q:

How to change Gazebo GUI focal length/FOV

Is it possible to change the focal length/field of view of the camera used to render the Gazebo GUI?  The default focal length looks really short, which has the tragic effect of making my planning scenario look easy to reviewers :(  I've noticed there is a camera tag in the world file, but it doesn't seem to be documented anywhere.

Hello Paul!
Somewhere within the gazebo robot configuration you will find the camera parameters like the following:
Changing the hfov will change you the field of view :-)
<sensor:camera name="cam_front_sensor">
  <imageSize>640 480</imageSize>
  <imageFormat>B8G8R8</imageFormat>
  <hfov>90</hfov>
  <nearClip>0.1</nearClip>
  <farClip>100</farClip>
  <updateRate>20.0</updateRate>
  .....
</sensor:camera>

You can compute the focal length with
f = (width/2)  / tan( deg2rad(hfov)/2) = (640/2) / tan(deg2rad(90)/2) = 320
The example above will give you a focal length of 320. Don't forget to convert the angle to radiant
Greetings
Markus
