Q:

What motor to use for reciprocating (reversive) movement

I want to make a copy of this machine Fisher Price Soothing Motionsâ„¢ Glider and I'm wondering what motor to use? Simple DC motor with appropriate gearbox (slow rpm) or stepper motor?
Here is another instance of this idea.

A:

A DC or AC gearmotor is all you need. If you're asking about a stepper because of the change in direction, you can use a crank shaft mechanism to convert motion from rotary to reciprocating linear like the one in the above image:
