Q:

KUKA LBR iiwa real-time control

Hi,
I want to setup the new KUKA LBR iiwa arm for (soft) real-time control (at around 100 Hz for now) in Gazebo and on the actual robot. I was thinking of using ros_control and I'm interested in weather somebody already has a similar setup (HW-interface, URDF/SDF model ...) or is working on it since I couldn't find anything for to the LBR iiwa online.
Thanks and all the best,
-Robert-

Update: I made a URDF description of the arm which can be found here. I am still interested in hints for the control setup though ...

Hi Robert,
have you seen this? https://bitbucket.org/khansari/iiwa/src
looks like it is currently used, so I assume it is in a working state: https://bitbucket.org/samirmenon/scl-manips-v2/wiki/iiwa/iiwa_main

Thanks, we have a similar solution using the Connectivity Servoing and ros_control right now. One of the issues we have, is that we need velocity control for which there's no interface provided by KUKA. Any input/discussion on how to achieve this would be appreciated.

Hi,
I'm currently trying to use the first link, but I get stuck at running the Kuka Hardware Manager. It says "Assignment not possible while KS is running", do you guys have the same problem? If you're using the same thing, that is?
