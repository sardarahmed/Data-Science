Q:

Unable to change Avatar image, "service unavailable"

This is sort of a meta-question. Everytime I try to upload a Avatar image to ROS Answers, I get
 Service unavailable

This service is currently unavailable.

If you have any questions, please contact the site administrator at 
admin@answers.ros.org

This has been the case everytime I tried in the last few months. I also tried writing a mail to the suggested email address multiple times, but only get a mail with the following back:
<<< 554 5.7.1 <admin@answers.ros.osuosl.org>: Relay access denied
554 5.0.0 Service unavailable
<<< 554 5.5.1 Error: no valid recipients

Any ideas on how to resolve this issues are appreciated. I know this isn´t exactly a ROS related question, but I feel I tried hard enough warranting asking here by now ;)
/edit: Incidentally, just got the "service unavailable" message when posting this question again. That of course looks like posting the question didn´t work at first, which is the reason we see double postings on this site occassionally.

Indeed, haven't seen that before. Will do.
