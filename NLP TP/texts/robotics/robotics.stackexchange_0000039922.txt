Q:

Cannot find mk package in Fuerte

Hello,
in Fuerte, the mk ROS package cannot be found.
I.e. it is located in /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros/core/mk/ and there is a manifest.xml
file in this directory but it is not added in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH in /opt/ros/fuerte/.
 $ rospack find mk
 [rospack] Warning: ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/fuerte/ros is not a directory
 [rospack] Error: stack/package mk not found

Did anyone experience the same issue?

A:

Due to file system hierarchy changes, the Fuerte environment is set up differently. You can't just substitute fuerte for electric in a customized setup script.
The correct setting for $ROS_ROOT is /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros.
You can source /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.bash directly when running with the Ubuntu install packages.
For building against that with custom overlays, I recommend rosws, a new command in the rosinstall package. It will build custom setup scripts and keep them up to date. It works fine for Electric workspaces, too.
