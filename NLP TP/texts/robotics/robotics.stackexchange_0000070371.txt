Q:

[skeleton.launch] is neither a launch file in package [skeleton_markers] nor is [skeleton_markers] a launch file

Hello, i had this strange error. a few days ago, i've succeed catkin_make and roslaunch skeleton_markers skeleton.launch . so the program successfully running. But, because of i have some error code for my other package on my workspace, someone said that i have to delete the 'build' folder in my workspace and re build my package, but i accidentally delete (with SHIFT+DEL) my install folder (which is source of my install/setup.bash). --this is my stupid accident--
after that, i remake my install folder by catkin_make install in my workspace folder with source in my devel/setup.bash and rebuild with catkin_make, and change again my source to install/setup.bash, and rebuild again with catkin_make.
but still, the result is said that  :
 [skeleton.launch] is neither a launch file in package [skeleton_markers] nor is [skeleton_markers] a launch file

i've done re-package my package folder by catkin_create-pkg, but the result still same. i don't know anymore what i have to do with this. please help me :"(
oh, and it's not only that package which have error, but i think all my package inside my workspace can't be launched :(
i can find my rospackage with rospack find <package>

A:

I think the best way you should follow is backing up your packages, deleting your catkin workspace and creating your workspace again with catkin_init_workspace . After you can put your packages back and run catkin_make. Do not forget to source your devel/setup.bash in your .bashrc file or running source /home/<username>/<catkin_ws>/devel/setup.bash in your terminal.
UPDATE
In your .bashrc, you should have:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
source ~/ros/devel/setup.bash

Also, seems like your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH variable is outdated. In your terminal, can you run;
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/adelleodel/ros/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks

I've try it for devel/setup.bash before.. and i hv problem with openni library (problem when catkin_make) that can't find openni package though the file was there, and the problem solved by changing my source to install/setup.bash (i don't know why). But i'll try again with ROS_PACKAGE_PATH update

Yeah, i succesfully can launch one of my packages. But, i still have another packages that still stuck in my old workspace path. It still respond same error, and when i rospack find package, it said that /home/adelleodel/rosadel/install/share/my_package what to do?

I get this error all the time!  What a flaky system!  Sourcing setup.bash fixes it SOMETIMES.  It's not working now.
