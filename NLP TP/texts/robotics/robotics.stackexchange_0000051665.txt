Q:

rqt_console sorting by order received?

It appears possible to sort by every column by clicking on them except the order received column (far left).  Sorting by Time does when there are a lot of messages due to the precision of the timer.
Saving to .csv appears to sort by how the console is sorting them, and removing the .config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini does not reset it.
How do I reset rqt_console to sort by order received?
