Q:

Kinect Data Via router to Host PC

I am working on an irobot create platform using a kinect to do some
basic navigation.
However I don't want to use an onboard computer to do the processing.
I wanted to do the processing on another host computer by accessing
the data through a wireless router housed on the create.
So is it possible to run ROS on this host computer and accessing the
robot via router

A:

Except for the possibility that your communication channel isn't suited for such large data transport (as mentioned by William) it's perfectly possible to run some nodes on an external machine. You can distribute this from one launch file by using the machine tags. It helps to have your SSH-keys set-up correctly.
You can find an example of such a file in our AR_pose_demo package. In the ar_pose_kb_double_distri launch file, I'm launching camera's with connected image processing over different computers and only the results are streamed over the Wifi channel.
