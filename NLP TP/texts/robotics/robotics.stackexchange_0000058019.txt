Q:

convert the yaw Euler angle into into the range [0 , 360]

Hi everyone,
I used the following code to get the yaw Euler angle:
// Convert quaternion to RPY.
  tf::Quaternion q;
  tf::quaternionMsgToTF(imu_msg->orientation, q);
  tf::Matrix3x3(q).getRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);

I get the Euler angle varying from [0,PI] and [-PI, 0]
I need rotation angles in the range of 0 to 360. Is it possible to get that directly?
Thanks in advance

A:

You can't get angles in degrees directly from the available library calls, but it's pretty trivial to convert radians to degrees:
double yaw = ...; // however you want to get yaw.
double yaw_degrees = yaw * 180.0 / M_PI; // conversion to degrees
if( yaw_degrees < 0 ) yaw_degrees += 360.0; // convert negative to positive angles

This answer was some time ago, but is this not incorrect?
PEP 103 specifies that yaw measured from the x-axis (i.e. in a geographic frame from East) and is positive CCW. Heading of course is measured from the y-axis, positive CW.
