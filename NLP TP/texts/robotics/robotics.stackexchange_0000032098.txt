Q:

Cell decomposition

Hello, I'm using probabilistic cell decomposition(2D&3D) for a path planning algorithm. It is possible to show the decomposition in RViz, which would be the solution programatically? - the cells dimensions can variate.

A:

You can send markers to rviz from your program. There are different markers available - lines, polygons, cubes, etc. The markers will probably be flexible enough to be able to represent the 2D and 3D data you are interested in.

There is any solution to display the cubes or any point to be transparent so like this just the edges would be visible.Thank you.
