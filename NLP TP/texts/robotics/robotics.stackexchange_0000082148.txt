Q:

How can i use multi-husky robots with laser scanner in gazebo?

I am new to ROS and Gazebo. I am using ros indigo and gazebo 2. I am using husky to simulate the system in gazebo simulator.
I have used your package for multi-husky mentioned here: https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/2016/03/simulating-multiple-husky-ugvs-in-gazebo/
It works fine with me. But I have a problem in using the laser scanner and the Kinect. I think they are mounted on the robots but they are not publishing to any topic. I found the topics of the laser scanner (/scan) but the scanner is not publishing to it and I want to have a topic for each robot’s scanner. Also when I try to add the scanner in Rviz I can’t find it in the topics of each robot.

A:

Probably check your argument value in launch file.
arg name="laser_enabled"  and its value might set to false.
