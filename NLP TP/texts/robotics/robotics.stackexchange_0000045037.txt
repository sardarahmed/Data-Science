Q:

move_base stop navigation

I am using the navigation stack with Trajectory Planner and dwa enabled. I am looking for a straightforward way to stop my robot during its navigation (for emergency or safety reason for example). One way to do this is to send the current robot position as a goal, but I am wondering if a stop navigation service already exists. I found the topic /move_base/cancel, but it is a request to cancel a specific goal.
Any suggestions?

sorry for the late response, but I found only now this comment. Yes, actually I use the current position of the robot as a goal, to stop it in a reactive way. It is straightforward, with amcl you can read the amcl_pose topic and sends this pose as goal with actionlib.

A:

You should use actionlib to send goals to your robot as shown in this tutorial. The action client provides the method cancelGoal. When you call it, the robot should stop moving.

@Lorenz how should i call the cancelGoal ? In the same node as in the tutorial? Im working on a person detecting code so the idea is that when a person is detected to stop the robot. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
