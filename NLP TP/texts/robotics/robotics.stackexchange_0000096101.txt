Q:

Unable to locate package ros-noetic-desktop-full on PI4 ubuntu focal

Good morning,
I followed all the instructions. I have Ubuntu 20. Installed on raspberry pi4 when I run sudo apt install ros-desktop-full, I get the error above "Unable to locate package ros-noetic-full".
Please advise.

What is the output of uname -rvmp and cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list?
Also:

I followed all the instructions

always link to any instructions you followed or are referring to.
We cannot know which instructions you've followed, and there are many.
And I just noticed:

when I run sudo apt install ros-desktop-full

that's actually not the correct package name.

get the error above "Unable to locate package ros-noetic-full".

And neither is ros-noetic-full.
Please do not paraphrase errors. Copy-paste them verbatim into your question.
We cannot help you otherwise.

Good Afternoon Thank you for your response. I was following the instruction posted here: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu (Step:1.4) with the command sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full and got the error E: Unable to locate package ros-noetic-desktop-full ....
To your follow-up question:
Output from uname -rvmp is :
5.4.0-1011-raspi #11-Ubuntu SMP Fri May 8 07:43:33 UTC 2020 aarch64 aarch64

Output from cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list  is :
deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu focal main

A:

According to status_page/ros_noetic_ufv8.html?q=desktop, the binary packages for arm64 of desktop_full are not building right now.
It is released, but the red squares indicate the binaries are missing, which typically means the build is failing for some reason.
A look at the release job seems to indicate that two packages which desktop_full depends on fail to build:

Nbin_ufv8_uFv8__simulators__ubuntu_focal_arm64__binary
Nbin_ufv8_uFv8__urdf_sim_tutorial__ubuntu_focal_arm64__binary

And from looking at their dependencies, it would seem gazebo_ros_pkgs and gazebo_ros_control isn't building on arm64 at the moment.
I haven't checked why that is the case, but it would seem that's why ultimately desktop_full is not available.
If you don't absolutely need Gazebo -- and I doubt it would make sense to run Gazebo on an RPi, even a 4 -- then you could install something other than desktop_full, something which doesn't include the simulators metapackage.

Okay  thank you. So should I guess I just have to wait for that to be functional then. Should I try back in 2 days or would it be linger than that?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-06-08:
Without looking at the reason for the build failure I can't say whether 2 days is enough.
If you'd like to know, I would encourage you to take a look at the issue tracker of gazebo_ros_pkgs. There may already be an issue open to track this.
And it will always go faster if more people help.

Will do. Thanks.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2020-06-08:
But you do want to run Gazebo on an RPi then?
Comment by chm007 on 2020-06-08:
I am looking to use ROS powered RPlidar borax, new territory for me..do you think I would have use for Gazebo for this?
Regards

Gazebo is a physics based robot simulator.
To use a rpilidar, I don't believe you'll need a simulator.
Or at least: you most likely don't need to run a simulator on your RPi.
