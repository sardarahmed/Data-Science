Q:

How to visualize Point cloud?

hi, I am new to ROS.I am using Fuerte distro. I went through the tutorials and learnt the basic commands regarding packages,nodes,publish,topic,etc using turtlesim (the means by which they were explained in the tutorial). Is there any tutorial to know about reading images(from the disk) and image processing or is it possible to read image or any data only from a bag file.
I have a bag file probably containing image & velodyne pointcloud data(found using rxbag) but i am not able to see any pointcloud. In the tutorial rviz was not clear for me. Please anyone help me with rviz and how to visualize the pointcloud from the bagfile. How to interpret the contents of the bagfile and use them?

Hi,
Here are the steps:

run rviz [rosrun rviz rviz]

Add display type in rviz [Add->PointCloud2] or may be just PointCloud

play your bag file [rosbag play abcdefg.bag]

Browse for the topic in the added display type in rviz

and if the point cloud is still not visible, change the display colors (because, usually it starts with white)
cheers!

thank you. i tried ur suggestion. I played the bag file. i run rviz . I am able to see the image by selecting in the image topic. I cant see any pointcloud since there is no topic in the PointCloud2 list. i also tried PointCloud. But when i do rostopic list, i get /velodyne_packets...

try [rostopic type /velodyne_packets] to check the type. may be the bag file does not contain any PointCloud topics afterall.
