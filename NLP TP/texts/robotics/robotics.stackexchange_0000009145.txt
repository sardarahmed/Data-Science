Q:

List of books similar to Thrun's Probabilistic Robotics for robot mechanics and manipulation

What?
Put together here a list of books (like the one for C/C++ on StackOverflow) that are spiritually similar to Sebastian Thrun's Probabilistic Robotics for robotic manipulation and mechanics.
Why?
Thrun's book is a wonderful resource for implementable algorithms while also dealing with the mathematics/theory behind them. In somewhat similar vein for robotic mechanics there is "A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation - S.Sastry, Z.Li and R.Murray" which has a lot of mathematical/theoretical content. What is missing however in this book are the algorithms concerned with how should/would one go about implementing the theoretical stuff.
Requirements

Ideally list books dealing with diverse areas of robotics.
The books have to present algorithms like what Thrun does in his book.
Algorithms presented have to be language agnostic and as much as possible not be based on packages like MATLAB in which case they should be categorized appropriately.

A:

This is my go-to book for all things manipulation.  But it covers some other topics as well.
Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control by Bruno Siciliano, Lorenzo Sciavicco, Luigi Villani, Giuseppe Oriolo.
