Q:

Is there a way to prioritize traffic in ROS?

There are two types of messages in our teleoperation system, i.e. video stream and haptic feedback. So it is important that data rate for haptic feedback should be not less than certain value. For video stream it is much less critical.
Probably, I can experimentally find certain frame rate for video such that haptic feedback is not deteriorated, but it is not very convenient.
Is there a way to do that automatically?
Thanks,
Boris

I doubt it.
You can use some kind of relay node that manages the bandwidth explicitly.

topic_tools throttle can throttle bandwidth.

@dornhege: Thanks, looks like it should solve the problem. Will report back once I try it.
