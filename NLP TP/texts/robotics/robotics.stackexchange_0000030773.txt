Q:

what techniques might improve vslam performance?

I have implemented the vslam_system and am in the process of testing it with some of my own data sets.  I was wondering if there are any plans to improve the computational speed in the future.  At the moment the computational performance is very acceptable in the beginning of a run and typically taking about 12.51 ms between frames, but eventually (after approximately 100 frames), it slows down to upwards of 890 ms between frames.

Would you mind re-titling this as a question? I'm hoping to set a trend to make browsing and answering questions easier. Perhaps something like "Is there a way to improve VSLAM performance?

A:

How is the memory footprint? A while ago I found a significant memory leak (https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4753); it might be related.
