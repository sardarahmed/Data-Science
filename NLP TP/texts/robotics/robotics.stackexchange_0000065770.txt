Q:

depth and RGB registration error in Kinect pointcloud data

I have set the parameter 'depth_registration' = TRUE, available in the openni.launch file in the package openni_launch. Still the point cloud stream shows a mismatch in depth and RGB data.
I observed the point cloud data using rviz.
I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with ROS fuerte.
I wish somebody could give me some tips about how to correct this mismatch error. One way is to change the transformation manually by hit and trial. But it would be really helpful, if some kind of automatic procedure is available in ROS.

Check this link. The colors are shifted towards left even in depth_registered point clouds.

probably because of calibration
