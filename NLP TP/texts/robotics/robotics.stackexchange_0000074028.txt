Q:

What to do with bloom when dependency unavailable on Debian

From ROS Kinetic looks like Debian (Jessie for Kinetic) will be official supported OS.
I had an issue when I made a release of a package into Kinetic where one of the dependencies was not yet available on Jessie at that time so that build on ROS buildfarm failed only for Jessie.
Looks like @tfoote fixed it by re-running bloom, but what magic with bloom we could use for this kind of problem?

A:

If the dependencies are not available you'll have to do like you did and tell bloom to skip that action.
If you skip an action for a target like debian it needs to be added to the blacklist on the buildfarm so that the buildfarm will not try to repeatedly build.
We are refactoring the buildfarm config to allow a higher level of granularity on the blacklisting: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/ros_buildfarm_config/pull/41 without that landed we could not easily blacklist a package for debian only. Once that's merged we will be able to do so.
