Q:

What should be the messageType for a custom message?

HI,
I created a custom ROS message:
string message
int32 a
int32 b

I will need to publish the messages from the web browser (roslibjs) and show it on the terminal, using python. Roslibjs requires us to specify a messageType when we start a topic, for example:
var msgTopic = new ROSLIB.Topic({
ros: ros,
name: 'chatter',
messageType: <messageType??>
});

I don't know what would be the messageType here, for my custom message. I would appreciate any help  with this.
Thank you!

A:

The message type is the name of the package plus the name of the file. For example if your package name is my_pkg_msgs and the file where you defined the message is MyMsg.msg, then the message type is my_pkg_msgs.MyMsg.

Hope this helps.
