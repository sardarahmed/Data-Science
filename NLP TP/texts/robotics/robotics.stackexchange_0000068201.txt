Q:

Localization based on a laserscan

Hello,
i have a question regarding the localization of a mobil robot. Unfortunately my robot is not able to offer wheel odometry. I am looking for an approach to localize my robot in a given map just based on a laserscan.
I read that hector_mapping can be used in this case, as it includes a laser-scanmatcher, which works well as stand alone. Is something similar avialable without the whole SLAM algorithm behind? I just need the "L" ;).
My robot has the constraint of relativly low computing power, why i also can't use visuel odometry.
Thx for your answers

cd src ;
git clone https://github.com/ccny-ros-pkg/scan_tools.git
apt-get  install libgsl0-dev
cd ..

Not a good answer, only for fuerte not for indigo..

The wiki page is just saying that documentation is only generated for electric and fuerte. I have used laser_scan_matcher in hydro with no issues.
