Q:

IK error : Planning scene not set

hi all,
when trying to run the IK solver I got this error:

[ERROR] [1340129176.933085357]: Inverse kinematics failed

with rxconsole I got this error:

Planning scene not set

when I looked at the log I got this error:

[0m] [ INFO] [1340111949.225789190]Did you set the log to debug? You can't know much with just one error: everything seems to be connected correctly as you're able to start / interrogate the service. But the IK is failing somehow. : Waiting for the joint_trajectory_action server to come up.

Any ideas please,

A:

I guess you are running constraint aware IK. It's always good to provide as much information as possible in question (see also here).
As the error says, you didn't set a planning scene. Just call the service /environment_server/set_planning_scene_diff. You can keep the SetPlanningSceneDiff service request empty. From the command line, you can set the planning scene by executing:
rosservice call /environment_server/set_planning_scene_diff '{}'
