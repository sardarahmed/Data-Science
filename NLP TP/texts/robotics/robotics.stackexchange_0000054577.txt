Q:

catkin+tmux problem

When I use catkin_make inside of a tmux session, and then source the devel/setup.sh, I sometimes end up with the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH being backwards. This causes my overlay to be an underlay, so catkin finds system ROS packages before my source packages. It doesn't always happen, and I don't have a reliable way to reproduce it. Its possible that it isn't actually related to tmux, but I've only seen the problem when inside a tmux session.
I'm posting here in the hope that someone has some insight into why this happens.
Here's the issue for this on github:

A:

I usually use screen not tmux, but have had similar issues. I was using a ROS environment, entered a screen session, and found that some of my ROS environment variables had been lost. And had to resource my setup.bash to be able to continue. I now make sure to enter screen with a clean environment and then source setup.bash in each new window. (screen doesn't share the env like tmux apparently does)
