Q:

PCL include files

Hi,
i am very new to the ROS-Package. I tried to understand the tutorials but i have some trouble.
I want to use the example code http://www.ros.org/wiki/pcl/Tutorials Example 5.2 and modifiy it, so it will use my piont cloud generateted by a kinect.
However, the problem is that if i run cmake the following error appears: "fatal error: pcl/range_image/range_image.h: No such file or directory"
So i tried to build a ROS pcl backage by following the tutorials. The problem remains. I'm really sure about, that i am doing something completly wrong.
So: How do I build a pcl package and use it in my own code?
Thanks for the help.

A:

Did you add pcl as a dependency in manifest.xml?
