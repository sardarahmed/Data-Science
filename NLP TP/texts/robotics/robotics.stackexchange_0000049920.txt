Q:

openni_launch crashes with "Failed to set USB interface"

Hi all!
I am running Ubuntu 12.10 and ROS Groovy. My problem is that my new Asus laptop only has the usb 3.0 ports. This causes a couple of issues with running openni_launch command with ASUS Xtion.
The errors were as follows:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'openni_wrapper::OpenNIException'
  what():  unsigned int openni_wrapper::OpenNIDriver::updateDeviceList() @ /tmp/buildd/ros-groovy-openni-camera-1.8.8-0quantal-20130326-0647/src/openni_driver.cpp @ 125 : enumerating image nodes failed. Reason: One or more of the following nodes could not be enumerated:

Image: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.0.41: Failed to set USB interface!

[camera_nodelet_manager-2] process has died [pid 18616, exit code -6, cmd /opt/ros/groovy/lib/nodelet/nodelet manager __name:=camera_nodelet_manager __log:=/home/olga/.ros/log/4920e3d2-99e4-11e2-8532-08606e0b1d34/camera_nodelet_manager-2.log].
log file: /home/olga/.ros/log/4920e3d2-99e4-11e2-8532-08606e0b1d34/camera_nodelet_manager-2*.log

It throws another bunch of errors after a couple of seconds, stating that other processes were not able to start properly, but I guess they are not really relevant here. Though I can of course attach them if needed.
Now, I have already done some digging. I have seen this post and did everything stated there, but this didn't help. I have also seen another post on google groups, but it didn't help either. And there was another ROS question in which they say I had to either apply a kernel patch or update a kernel, which I did with no luck.
Does anyone have any idea of how can this be fixed? Or any advices from those able to run kinect on the usb 3.0.
It really sucks having a new i7 laptop and not being able to run the camera on the machine.
Thanks in advance!

@nios I have faced this issue in both Fuerte and Groovy while working with ASUS Xtion Pro Live, it is pathetic ! I had to move to Electric to make everything work fine !

A:

Regarding the USB3 issue, I recently came across this:
ASUS USB3 hotfix
I have not tested it, but it might be worth a shot.
