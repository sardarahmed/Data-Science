Q:

publishing calibration data with bag file

Hi,
I recorded a bag file with a video sequence. The corresponding bag file does only contain the image_raw topic, as by the time I recorded the sequence I had not calibrated the camera yet.
Now I have calibrated the camera, and I would like to play the bag file and simultaneously publish the camera_info data so that, for example, I can undistort the images from the bag file using image_proc.
How can I start a publisher that only publishes the camera_info ? Or could I add this camera_info in some way to the pre-existing bag file ?
Thanks

Hello!
Have you complemented this function? I'm also meeting this problem.
If you have solved this, may I please get your some reference?
Thank you

Hi BeLioN,
please take a look at our image_sequence_publisher where we publish images as a ros topic, while we read a yaml file and publish it as calibration for a "fake" camera.
You could take part of our code to make a node that publishes your calibration info in the correct topic.
