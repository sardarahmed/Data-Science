Q:

simulate robotic arm of my size

Hello all.
So I would like be able to simulate a robotic arm BUT:

I don't have an physical arm. I just want to be able to simulate it.
I want the robotic arm to be of whatever size I chose (in how many places it can rotate, how long each part is and so on).

In other words. I want to be able to visualize a robotic arm (in rviz maybe, not sure) with out having a robotic arm in real life. Then to be make it have whatever sizes I want.
Can I do this with ROS and with what packages?
Besides the simulation part, is there a package that allows me to easily move it (do the kinematics and everything)? For example, I want to be able to say to the arm "make a line from [x,y,z] to [x' , y', z'] " and then for it to see a simulated arm do it.

A:

For the robot arm part, you can make an autocad/google sketchup/ drawing which can be exported as an stl or dae file. Use the stl file in a urdf file - and gazebo will be able to visualize it for you.
This urdf tutorial has a section on how to use meshes (which is what you want) at the end. You could also make a custom geometry based arm using bars, and so on - but it'd be a bit more complicated.
You don't need a physical arm to do any of this.
To do the inverse kinematics part, MoveIt is the most popular that I've seen - but I've never used it - so, I can't coment about it much. have a look at it here : http://moveit.ros.org/wiki/Kinematics
