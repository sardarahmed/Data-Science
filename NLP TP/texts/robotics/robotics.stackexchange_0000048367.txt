Q:

MD5 Checksum cannot be null

I start up a subscriber on my android device to listen to a publisher running on my computer. I receive the following error after my subscriber has been created and executed:
E/SubscriberHandshakeHandler(3885): Subscriber handshake failed: Incoming MD5 checksum cannot be null.
I believe it occurs on receipt of the first message, but I am not sure.
I am running jellybean on the tablet and groovy on the pc. They are connected over a wifi connection with the roscore running on the pc.
Any help is appreciated!

Are you using the latest rosjava? How is the publisher written? In Java as well?

A:

I figured it out. I using a publisher with a custom-built message that was essentially serialized to a string, but still a custom-message in name. My subscriber was looking for std_msgs/String, but not receiving any, so the checksum was off.
Sorry for the confusion.
