Q:

Tool to visualize launch files

I was wondering if anybody knew of a tool that could be used to visualize launch files.  Some launch files are very complex and hierarchical.  They can almost be thought of as code, they take parameters and can be very dynamic.  This complexity is hard to manage, even for launch files with which you are familiar. A graphical visualization would be great, but even something as simple as the urdf verification tools would be nice(see here )

A:

There is a tool called rxdeveloper, maybe that is what you are looking for.
Also (this may sound trivial, but helps me quite a bit) in most IDEs you can choose to see the launch files as markup language, that will add colors to the otherwise black/white text.
