Q:

How to include other package's headers?

I tried to create "A" and "B" package.
I added include/A/a.h on directory which "roscd A".
Then I use a.h in b.cpp and add manifest on package B:
 #include <A/a.h>
 
 int main()
 {
    return 0;
 }

manifest:
 <package>
   <description brief="B">
 
      B
 
   </description>

   <review status="unreviewed" notes=""/>
   <url>http://ros.org/wiki/B</url>
   <depend package="roscpp"/>
   <depend package="A"/>
 
 </package>

But compile failed because of couldn't find A/a.h.
How to solve it?
Thank you~

A:

Package A needs to export its headers. Add this to its manifest.xml file:
<export>
  <cpp cflags="-I${prefix}/include" lflags="-L${prefix}/lib"/>
</export>

For more info see the XML Reference
