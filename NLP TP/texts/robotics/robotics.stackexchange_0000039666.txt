Q:

how to publish/subscribe with remote roscore?

Current setup:

roscore running on my remote server ( a virtual private server ) VPS
Machine A and B are connected to internet
Machine A publishes a topic "test_topic"

Result:

Machine A can subscribe to the topic using rostopic echo /test_topic
BUT Machine B  CAN NOT subscribe to the topic ( using rostopic echo /test_topic or using python/c++)
VPS, where roscore is running, CANNOT subscribe to the topic

However, rotopic list shows "/test_topic"!
So, is it possible to use a roscore running on a remote server and nodes connecting over internet?
Thanks.

A:

Given your firewall settings allow that and DNS settings are correct, it should be possible. See here.
