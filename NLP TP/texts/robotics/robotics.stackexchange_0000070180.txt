Q:

How to store explored nodes in ROS?

Hi,
I am using nav2d to explore a map. Is there any way I can store the order of explored nodes in a data structure?
I was thinking we can whether I can use rosbag for this somehow. Please let me know if anyone knows about this
Thanks

What do you want to achieve? All nodes are published on a Marker topic, but this list is more or less unordered.

I want to check the overlap in the algorithm. So, I want to have the order of explored nodes, so that I can track what path the robot followed.

A:

I don't see how this could be done out-of-the-box. But the pointclouds that are attached to the nodes should have a sequence number or at least a timestamp, that can be used to order them. But you would have to find a proper way to output them via ROS.
Another way might be to wite a very simple node, that regularly logs to robot's pose via TF.

Yes, that's a great idea, I can write a node to log the robot's pose through tf_listener. But, I am not sure, how can I trace the position back to the specific occupancy grid cell. Is there any way where I can relate a position with the cell number?

I don't think so. The grid map is dynamically created from the laser scans and the corrected poses from the slam-backend whenever get_map is called. Such a relation would even change with an optimization run of the backend after a loop was closed.
