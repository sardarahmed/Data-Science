Q:

create_autonomy does not seen by ros

I followed the instruction from https://github.com/autonomylab/create_autonomy but roslaunch seems to be does not aware of ca_driver even if I source the package via source ~/create_ws/devel/setup.bash. Roscd can not locate the folder and roslaunch says

[create_2.launch] is neither a launch file in package [ca_driver] nor is [ca_driver] a launch file name

Is there anything that I missed? python-rosdep and python-catkin-tools packages installed, catkin build completed succesfully. I am using ros indigo and ubuntu 14.04 on macbook pro.
UPDATE
Now I can see the launch file by editing bashrc file. I added the line
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/create_ws:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
But now I can not connect to create 2. terminal says that "failed to receive data from Create. Check if robot is powered!" but it is powered and connected to computer and I have checked that serial usb port is connected as ttyUSB0.
Is there a setting I need to make on the robot?

A:

I believe the message you see indicates either (as it states) the robot is not powered on meaning you should try pushing the large "Clean" button, or the baud rate is not correct.
See Create 2 OI Spec for information regarding baud. It could be 115200 (I believe the driver's default) or 19200. You can try a different rate by adding a parameter to the launch file ca_driver/launch/create_2.launch:
<param name="baud" value="19200" />
Good luck.

I followed this step and succeed once, then the same issue came back again and  I can't fix it by using this.
UPDATE
Fixed by adding export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/create_ws:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
