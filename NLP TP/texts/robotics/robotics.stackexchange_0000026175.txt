Q:

Querying simulation time in a plugin

Hello,
New to Gazebo, and I am trying to check the simulation time as part of my robot operation. Any advice on how to get started?
I have tried creating a common::Time object, which can get the wall time, but it doesn't have access to simulation time.

A:

Hello,
A plugin can access the World, which has a GetSimTime() function:
http://gazebosim.org/api/1.5.0/classgazebo_1_1physics_1_1World.html#ab767393cb972e31d86a3b935e3eed569
You can also subscribe to ~/world_stats which publishes messages of type WorldStatistics:
