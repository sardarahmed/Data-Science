Q:

map_server to save map from nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid published by the Google cartographer ROS API?

Hi, I am using Google cartographer ROS API to generate a map. Is it possible to use ROS map_server with this to save the map using rosrun map_server map_server mymap.yaml or retrieve the map using nav_msgs/GetMap?

Hello, I find the problem about "waiting for the map" when I use map saver to generate a map.I think it's possible to use the command you said above.But my problem is that it's always waiting for the map and there's no map generated.
