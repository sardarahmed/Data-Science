Q:

E: Unable to locate package ros-VERSION-velodyne

Hello,
I followed the instructions and installed ROS.  When I try to do the step from Getting Started with the Velodyne HDL-32E "Install the Velodyne stack from the repositories by running sudo apt-get install ros-VERSION-velodyne" I get the following error:
user@user:~$ sudo apt-get install ros-VERSION-velodyne
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
**E: Unable to locate package ros-VERSION-velodyne**

Not sure what I am doing wrong.
Thanks for any help.

A:

sudo apt-get install ros-VERSION-velodyne

you are expected to replace VERSION with the ROS version that you are running.
So for Indigo, you'd use:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-velodyne

Note: the velodyne packages have not yet been released into Kinetic, so ros-kinetic-velodyne will not work.

Do you know when the kinetic version might be released?

No, I don't. There is an open issue about it though.

Soon, I hope. Meanwhile, build it from source; that does work.

How about jade?
Comment by joq on 2017-03-29:
Jade should build from source, too. If it does not work, please open a github issue.

@joq, any instructions on how to build from source?

Like this http://answers.ros.org/question/226594/how-do-i-build-ros-vlp16-velodyne-driver-for-indigo-using-catkin/

Substitute jade for indigo, of course.
