Q:

Error while pressing execute button in moveit with real robot

Hello there,
I have successfully integrated real robots with moveIt. I can move at my given path with the plan & execute button, but if I press the Plan button and then it executes that plan. After, when I press the Execute button I am obtaining this error, and my robot doesn't move.
Guys any idea where I am doing a mistake?
[ERROR] [1617204711.965383782]: 
Invalid Trajectory: start point deviates from current robot state more than 0.01 joint 'joint_a2': expected: -1.5708, current: -1.47654

I have checked the things which you maintained but then also I am not able to fix the solution.
When I am doing the plan and execute the first time it is working fine and from the second time I am getting Failed error. I am attaching a screenshot below.

When I am pressing the plan & execute button I am getting the execution successful!

Thanks for helping!

A:

Most likely, either

A) your start state is not at your current robot position when you start planning, or
B) the robot moved after you created the plan.

To set the start state before planning, try selecting the <current> option from the Start State dropdown menu in the Planning tab of the MotionPlanning plugin in Rviz. You can also visualize the start state by looking for the "Query Start" checkbox in the display widget.
