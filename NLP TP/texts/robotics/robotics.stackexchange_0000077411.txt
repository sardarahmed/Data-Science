Q:

ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME

Hello,
In my understanding according to the wiki, ROS_IP is for the IP address of the host machine where a ROS node runs and ROS_HOSTNAME is for a resolvable host name. But I'm confused because an IP address is also a resolvable name(maybe resolved name?). So even when I set an IP address to ROS_HOSTNAME, everything works well.
I saw the source codes and found that both are treated almost same(rocpp, rospy).
So my questions are

Why are there two environmental variablesROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME, even though both are treated almost same?
Is it better to always use ROS_HOSTNAME to avoid network troubles? I've seen some people have troubles because they set both variables and ROS_IP doesn't work as they expected.

Thanks in advance.

As a general comment, whenever I've had ROS networking issues exporting ROS_HOSTNAME=$ROS_IP fixes them.

A:

Not an answer, but IMO this is a worthwhile thing to discuss as a possible improvement in ros_comm, so I opened a ticket.
The example section in the NetworkSetup wiki explains when having both variables are useful, but the usecases there don't sound convincing enough to me that we have to have 2 different variables.
If there are actually usecases where separate variables are needed, I/we'd appreciate if you share the story in the linked ticket.
