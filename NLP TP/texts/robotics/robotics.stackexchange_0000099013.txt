Q:

ROS cannot install Noetic due to unmet dependencies 20.04

Hi all,
Today I've tried installing ROS Noetic on a fresh install on 20.04 Ubuntu. Following the instructions on the ROS wiki for installation. I've now tried this both in a VM on a desktop, and without a VM on a laptop. Both with fresh installs on 20.04 LTS. In both setups I am met with the error:
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 ros-noetic-desktop-full : Depends: ros-noetic-simulators but it is not going to be installed
                           Depends: ros-noetic-urdf-sim-tutorial but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Does anyone know how to correct this?

Check out #q279780, #q282399, #q315820, #q243920. Using aptitude in place of apt might be a good start.

A:

It's likely you are running into osrf/gazebo#2995.
The Pull Request fixing that is already merged: ros-infrastructure/reprepro-updater#114.
It will take some time for fixes to propagate to the main repositories however.
If you must absolutely install Noetic right now, you could try adding the Gazebo package repositories, which should have the needed package(s).
Note: you should only need to add the repository. You do not need to install Gazebo separately.

Thanks, adding the Gazebo package repositories worked for me following this process:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'

wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

dont forget to update sources:
sudo apt update

then you sould be able to install ros following these instructions

Note: this is just a work-around until the problematic packages have been added to the ROS repositories.
