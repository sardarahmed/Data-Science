Q:

How to convert a .urdf file to .sdf 1.4 format

Hello all,
gzsdf print pr2.urdf > pr2.sdf gives errors in gazebo 1.7.1
Error [parser.cc:719] XML Element[turnGravityOff], child of element[link] not defined in SDF. Ignoring.[link]
Error [parser.cc:710] Error reading element <link>
Error [parser.cc:710] Error reading element <model>
Error [parser.cc:369] Unable to read element <sdf>
Error [parser.cc:291] parse as old deprecated model file failed.
why does gzsdf fail?
Thank you
Peshala

why does Gazebo still requires ros-fuerte-urdfdom by the way? (I am using Groovy)
Comment by nkoenig on 2013-04-26:
Ubuntu Precise builds of Gazebo require ros-fuerte-urdfdom because we wanted to limit the number of ubuntu/ros/gazebo builds.

A:

Tags like <turnGravityOff> no longer exists in new sdf format and in fact being replaced by <gravity> and so on. By manually changing these tags accordingly I could convert the urdf to sdf.
