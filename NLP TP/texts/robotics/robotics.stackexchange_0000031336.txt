Q:

Ubuntu 9.10 repository for diamondback?

I haven't taken to the new age Ubuntu (10.XX and 11.XX) and I am pretty happy with Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala). Is there any way to install diamondback in Ubuntu 9.10 ?
Any help will be greatly appreciated
UPDATE : http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu/Source - this works ! I could install ROS-1.4.6 on Ubuntu 9.10

A:

REP 3 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html#diamondback-feb-2011) states that Diamondback is targeted at Lucid through Natty, so there certainly aren't debians being built. You may be able to build from source, however, there may be some libraries which need to be manually updated. Instructions for installing from source can be found on the wiki: http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu/Source
