Q:

Is there hardware_interface::RobotHW in ros2?

Hi. Sorry for all mistakes, English is not my native language. I'm porting my project from ros1 Noetic to ros2 Foxy right now and can't find hardware_interface::RobotHW or something that inherit it functionality. I'll appreciate for any hint what and there to look.

OK, I understand.

A:

Quoting from the documentation:

The implementation of RobotHW is not used anymore. This should be migrated to SystemInterface class or, for more granularity, SensorInterface and ActuatorInterface.

I suggest reading the documentation at the following link:
