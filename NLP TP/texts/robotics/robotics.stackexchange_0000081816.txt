Q:

sound_play action client c++

Hi all
Anyone knows how to use the sound_play action_lib client request c++ version?
I've see that only a python test file is available.
Thank you so much

some of the examples in C++ are given here.

A:

I solved it alone because there's nothing about it on the wiki or other pages (only python)
For who will be in my same situation, I post some code snippet
Here is what is needed to be included
#include <actionlib/client/simple_action_client.h>
#include <sound_play/SoundRequestAction.h>

The definition of the Action Client
typedef actionlib::SimpleActionClient<sound_play::SoundRequestAction> SoundClientTest;

The definition of the Sound Client Goal
sound_play::SoundRequestGoal goal;

All the other things are the same as, for ex, the move base action client.
I hope this could be helpful
