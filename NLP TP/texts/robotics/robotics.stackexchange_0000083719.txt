Q:

trying to figure out location of interrupt exit -6

I am running a two bag files one runs fine the other produces an error:
[rgbdtam-3] process has died [pid 28773, exit code -6, cmd /home/rjn/catkin_ws/devel/lib/rgbdtam/rgbdtam /camera/rgb/image_color:=/xtion/rgb/image_raw /camera/depth/image:=/xtion/depth/image_raw __name:=rgbdtam __log:=/home/rjn/.ros/log/8047b868-c1a3-11e7-9b8b-0028f87b9f9e/rgbdtam-3.log].
log file: /home/rjn/.ros/log/8047b868-c1a3-11e7-9b8b-0028f87b9f9e/rgbdtam-3*.log

The bag file producing the error has its depth image as 16UC1 and the other bag has 32FC1.  I am assuming that is is what is causing the error as there are only image and depth messages in the bag files nothing else.
I tried using dbg to catch the stack trace but it does not produce one.
Does anyone know how to capture the or issue a stack trace form dbg?
thank you.
Here is output of gdb window. note line number reference given....thanks for help.

A:

Exit code -6 is -SIGABRT (see man/signal(7)).

Does anyone know how to capture the or issue a stack trace form dbg?

Provided you are running rgbdtam inside GDB (using a launch-prefix fi) and rgbdtam is a C++ node, you should just be able to bt <enter> after GDB has caught the crash.

did that ... but did not produce trace.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-11-06:
Then I think we're going to need much more information: please show us how you ran the node in GDB exactly (ie: copy-paste from your terminal and / or launch file). More info about the node, any command sequences you used, etc.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-11-06:
Additionally (but I've no way of knowing whether you already did that): make sure you've performed a debug build of the package/workspace. Without that, GDB will not be able to find any symbols, making any backtrace much less informative.
Comment by rnunziata on 2017-11-06:
I ran with
launch-prefix="xterm -e gdb --args"
in launch file....and compiled with set debug.  Got some output in gdb window but but can not seem to copy it ., other wise I would update question.
Still not a full stack trace .... as to where in node call is .

Select the output in the terminal, right mouse button -> copy, or ctrl+shift+c. Then ctrl+v in your question text (edit it), select it, press Preformatted Text button (101010).
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2017-11-06:
O wait, you're running in an xterm. Then it's a little different. See ask ubuntu/How does copy-paste work with xterm?.
Comment by rnunziata on 2017-11-06:
you can copy and past by selecting text in xterm, then simutaiously pressing the left and right enter keys
Ive updated the question .. problem resolved.
