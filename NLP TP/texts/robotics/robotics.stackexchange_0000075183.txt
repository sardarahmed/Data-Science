Q:

How to identify if a dependency is run time or build dependency?

I am creating a package to subscribe to a topic from a node in another package. I understand that the only dependency required is the message package.  Is this a run time or build dependency?

A:

Are you using the messages when you build your code? If yes, they're a build dependency.
Are you using the messages when you run your code? If yes, they're a run-time dependency.
It is perfectly fine to have a package as both a build and run-time dependency.

Also worth mentioning REP 140 "Package Manifest Format Two Specification". Has some nice explanations and of course introduces new tags.
