Q:

message size limit

In one of my nodes I get in a service call
a message of over a gigabyte was predicted in tcpros. that seems highly unlikely, so I'll assume protocol synchronization is lost.

In this case the msg is really 1+ Gig. Is is possible to increase the messages size limit temporary for this service call?

WTF? 1 Gigabyte? What are you transmitting there?
Comment by Wolf on 2015-04-26:
is kind of a map stitched from many images, sent once from the node that creates is to the node that uses it

A:

The message size limit in ROS is hardcoded. It should be possible to change it, but you'll need to modify roscpp and recompile it to do so.
A quick search on github turns up four locations that might be producing your error message: https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=gigabyte

Thank you for the hint! I managed to compress the data before transferring it, which works around the issue as well....
