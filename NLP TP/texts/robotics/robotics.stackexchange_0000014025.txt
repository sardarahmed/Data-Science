Q:

How to find a smartphone with a quadcopter?

I think there are some quad-copter at the market those can find you from your smart phone. I don't know how accurate it is and how does it works? Is there a solution that I can build an android/ios application that quad-copter can find exactly the smart phone which has this app installed?

A:

You can make an app that send the location of your phone, then you can use sensor fusion using Wi-Fi and IMU to enhance the precision.
But to locate people, like spying you only need Kali Linux, a few exploitables, you don`t need a drone.
I understood you want to build a drone that follows you. There are some you can buy, but DIY is more fun. 
This can be modified to do what you want using ROS.
