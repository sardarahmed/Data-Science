Q:

Is there a clang-format file for ROS 2?

I could not find a clang-format file to apply the rules found in the ROS 2 Developer Guide.
Does anyone know if such a file exists somewhere?
Thanks

A:

The file is embedded in the ament_clang_format package which provides the linter API / CLI: https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/blob/26397786f603b8e9e4c3c399c3d33b1c6873ee0d/ament_clang_format/ament_clang_format/configuration/.clang-format

I don't think it can be applied to our code base, but it is close.
