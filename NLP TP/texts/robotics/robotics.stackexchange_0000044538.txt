Q:

ros gazebo worlds problem

Hi, I am a beginner to ROS and gazebo. I get the following problem when I try launching gazebo simulator. On entering "rosmake gazebo worlds" I get a message gazebo_worlds ROS_NOBUILD in package gazebo_worlds. I get the same message for each package. Plz help........

A:

That's not a problem. It just means that the package is already built and that it was installed from Debian packages. Did you try to run gazebo?
