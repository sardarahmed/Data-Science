Q:

Controlling a urdf model on Gazebo unsing pr2_mechanism package

I have a urdf robot model that I want to simulate and control on gazebo. I need to know if I can use the pr2_mechanism package to control my robot on the gazebo.
If I can can I simply follow the tutorials given in the ROS tutorials ? If now what are the what should I using ?
Can I use the following tutorial and apply it for a joint that I want to control and see it on Gazebo :
http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_mechanism/Tutorial/Writing%20a%20realtime%20joint%20controller
http://ros.org/wiki/pr2_mechanism/Tutorials/Running%20a%20realtime%20joint%20controller
If not what tutorials must I follow for me to create a controller for my robot ?
I do not find enough document to follow things around, can someone please explain .
