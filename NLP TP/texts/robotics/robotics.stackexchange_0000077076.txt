Q:

Creating Packages of ros--package_name type

Folks,
How do I convert my catking workspace in the equivalent of a, for instance, ros-indigo-openni2_camera type? By that I mean, how can I distribute my packages to other computers without having to share my code?
I want to have the same effect as when I do, for instance, sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni2-launch on my terminal.
Thanks.

A:

Do catkin_make --install. This will create an install directory and put all your package binaries, launch files and config files in /lib and /share respectively. You can zip this install folder and unzip it in a different catkin workspace. Make sure you copy /lib into /opt/ros/lib and /share to /opt/ros/share.

seems like the "--" does not go before "install." What if I have personal ".txt" files I need to access? Will they also be installed inside the "install" folder?

Yes. You can install rules to copy any directory into your /share directory of install like this -
install(DIRECTORY launch/
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}/launch)

This will copy all files inside /launch directory of your package to /share/<pkg_name>/launch .
