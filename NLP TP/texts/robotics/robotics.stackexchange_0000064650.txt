Q:

message type for wheel angular velocity and direction

hi everyone
I want to publish wheel angular velocity and its rotation direction message from my base_controller package to arduino. Now i dont know which message type is appropriate to use for this work in common_msgs stack. Because i need to have 2 numbers which contain a number for angular velocity and a number which is 0 or 1 to demonstrate direction of my motor.
Is Twist a good case? Does someone have an idea? Thanks:))
