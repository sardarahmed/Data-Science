Q:

ROS topic structure?

What is the basic structure of any topic on ROS?
My aim is to convert every topic to a binary data, that can be send on a network.
And again publish each topic from its respective binary data.
I am getting help from rosbag and wifi_comm packages. I am not getting complete information of basic structure of topic.
Thanks

A:

You should look at ROS' message serialization.
It already does exactly what you want - convert it to binary and send it over a network.
