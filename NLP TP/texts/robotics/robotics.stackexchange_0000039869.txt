Q:

Turtlebot rviz Camera & Point Cloud2 topics not available to choose

Following "Visualizing Turtlebot Kinect Data" tutorial, can add Camera and Point Cloud 2 (Yellow background), but Image Topic depth or rgb choices are not listed. Image window is black. Dashboard Diagnostic & Breaker 0 so Kinect is powered on-blinking green light and red laser is on.
Workstation roswtf gives this:

A:

The problem was fixed after discovering there appears to have been a power problem with my iCreate base. Powering the Kinect with its provided AC supply (rather than the Turtlebot Gyro and Power Adapter) and manually running roscore and kinect.launch result in good Camera and PointCloud 2 operation.
