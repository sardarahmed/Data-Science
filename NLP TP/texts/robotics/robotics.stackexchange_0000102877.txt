Q:

Where should I put launch folder?

In the launch file tutorial, I am a little confused where should I put this launch folder, and what is the content of this folder?
Can someone help clarify? Thanks!

A:

Hi @Hongbo Miao, I am not sure why the launch folder is not shown in the tutorial but it will be inside the package py_launch_example After that, the launch file script that you will write later will be put inside this launch folder.
