Q:

Combining Header and Pose to make Posestamped

Hi there,
I am trying to a node that publishes posestampted messages to a topic when a float is the value of 1.0 on a different topic.
Could any of you kind people help me with where I am going wrong? Please find a picture on the link below..

I believe the problem is wrong syntax on line 16, causing frame_id: odom, position:
rather than causing frame_id: odom
position:
Please forgive me for being such a python newbie.
Thanks in advance!

A:

To publish it needs an object of the message type. Try something like
PS = PoseStamped()

and
PS = PoseStamped(msg.header, msg.pose.pose)
