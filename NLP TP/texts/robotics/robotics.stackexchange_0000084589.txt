Q:

Turtlebot not moving

I'm a newbie and running Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04, gazebo 2.2.3.
I'm working on the tutorial and got some errors.
Command
$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

Here are errors.
 [FATAL] [1515488958.125011231, 0.130000000]: Failed to load nodelet '/cmd_vel_mux` of type `yocs_cmd_vel_mux/CmdVelMuxNodelet` to manager `mobile_base_nodelet_manager'
    [FATAL] [1515488958.139058732, 0.140000000]: Failed to load nodelet '/depthimage_to_laserscan` of type `depthimage_to_laserscan/DepthImageToLaserScanNodelet` to manager `laserscan_nodelet_manager'

gazebo gui shows up but turtlebot won't move.
Can anyone tell me what went wrong?

What is this a duplicate of?
It seems like you resolved your own question. Would accepting your own answer not be better in that case?

Sorry my mistake.
As you suggest, I'd like to change the reason. but I can't reopen for short points.

I've just re-opened it for you.
No need to 'change the reason': just tick the checkmark to the left of your own answer to answer your own question.
We don't close questions here on ROS Answers if they have an answer.

I've found a solution by myself.
Here's what I did.
Command
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-yocs*

Now it looks fine.
