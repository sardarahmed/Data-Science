There should be a button saying "Post a comment" right below any reply

I am allowed to comment only with my own post?

A:

You have to have at least 10 karma in order to be able to add comments. EDIT: To other posts.  You can always comment on your own posts.
Answer some questions (or just asking this one might be enough), and then you will receive that capability.
