Q:

Are there any aerodynamics modeling/simulation software that is capable to consume a SolidWorks model and to interface with MATLAB/Simulink?

Currently I am developing a control system for an aircraft of a unique design (something in between a helicopter and a dirigible). At this moment I can model only the dynamics of this vehicle without any aerodynamic effects taken into account. For this I use the following work-flow:
Mechanical model in SolidWorks -> MSC ADAMS (Dynamics) <--> MATLAB/Simulink (Control algorithms)
Thus, the dynamics of the vehicle is modeled in ADAMS and all control algorithms are in MATLAB/Simulink. Unfortunately, ADAMS can not simulate any aerodynamic effects. As a result, I can not design a control system that is capable to fight even small wind disturbances.

A:

Matlab has a package called Simscape that you can use for modeling physical systems in general. I would just caution you up front that Simscape is almost more like a plugin manager in that it enables other modules and doesn't offer a terrific amount of content on its own. This means you get to buy Simscape, then buy whatever other toolboxes you want that require Simscape. That said, if you're using Solidworks, you/your company is probably no stranger to paying good money for (great) software tools. 
Once you have Simscape, you can purchase/install a package called SimMechanics. This package has the capability to interface with Solidworks; see the videos here and here (the second video is embedded in this page in case you have trouble accessing it).
Lastly, there's an Aerospace Blockset for Simulink that helps you model wind, but I'm not an aero guy and haven't used this set, so I can't comment on how useful it may be.
