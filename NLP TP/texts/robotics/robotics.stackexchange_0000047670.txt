Q:

Sick LMS Series Sensors

All,
I see on the ros.org website that the Sick LMS1xx & LMS2xx sensors are supported in ROS:

Does anyone know if the new Sick LMS5xx sensor is supported?
Does anyone know of a 360 degree Sick sensor supported in ROS?

Thank you in advance!
Andy

A:

We use the RCPRG package to work with the LMS1xx series sensors via Ethernet. I have played with using it with the LMS5xx, but ran into issues which I think were mainly related to the LMS5xx not being as easy to set up for continuous output as the LMS1xx.

I just want to notice you, that LMS1xx driver is a bit buggy.
Comment by Ryan on 2013-02-04:
How so?
Comment by ZdenekM on 2013-02-04:
At least length of  the array for ranges is shorter for higher angular resolution and longer for lower one. You need to swap two lines. And there are probably more bugs - it seems that min and max angles are not set properly etc.

Could you please attach the code where the lines needs to be swapped?
Comment by tfoote on 2013-03-21:
@ZdenekM please file tickets against software you know about bugs in.
Comment by ZdenekM on 2013-04-08:
@rohan: In LMS1xx_node.cpp, find line 55 ("num_values = 541;") and line 59 ("num_values = 1081;"). Swap numeric values.
@tfoote: This code is not released as far as I know. Where and how I can post bug report? I can't find even author's email...

Now I see it's on github (I thought it's on some svn)... Hm, I will try to fork it and make pull request.
