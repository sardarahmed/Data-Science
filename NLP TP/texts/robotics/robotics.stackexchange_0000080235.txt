Q:

Point rviz to new roscore?

As Neil Traft pointed out in his question RViz won't refresh my TF tree, You need to restart RViz whenever you start a new roscore. RViz looks for a roscore upon startup. After that time, the roscore remains fixed.
Is it somehow possible to point rviz to a new roscore if the one it found on startup doesn't exist anymore?

A:

No; this is a general issue with roscpp, and you cannot change the roscore that roscpp is using once it is started.
