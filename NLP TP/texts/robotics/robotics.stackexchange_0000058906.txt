Q:

boost:bind self-pointing pointer

I'm writing a test program about actionlib. Referencing the wiki document of SimpleActionServer. However, I makes a error because of this instruction.
Server server(n, "do_dishes", boost::bind(&execute, _1, &server), false);

The variable server is used before it's allocated as server. Is that possible? At least, my visual studio 2010 compiler doesn't understand that style of code. Please help me.

A:

The code example on the wiki page seems to be wrong.
If you look at this tutorial you see that the placeholder for the callback arguments _1 has to be after the pointer to the object.
Does this solve your problem?

I saw the tutorial you suggested already. In there, they uses a wrapping class. it works. (with a warning). but i want to do this by not making additional class. i also asked this strange syntax question to stackoverflow.com. i finally notified that MSVC cannot build it while G++ can do it.
