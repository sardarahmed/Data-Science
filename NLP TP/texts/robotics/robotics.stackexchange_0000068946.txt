Q:

Sending data from ROS to server-socket

Hey ROS-community,
i got stuck with a problem:
I created a Ros topic, which publishes me an array of angles in a frequency of 1hz.
Now i want to send those angles to a robot control, which is a server-socket.
I now need some kind of client-socket to sent the data to the robot control.
What is the common way to do this in ROS?
Looking for a solution i always found something about the ros_bridge_suite.
But the tutorials only show how to create a ros bridge server.
I got the IP and the Port number of the server, how can i connect to it?
Thanks for help.
Best regards,
Carl

A:

I had to do something similar, but in the reverse direction. The implementation is a little old (uses rosbuild), but can be updated pretty easily. If you need help with updating it to catkin, just let me know.
