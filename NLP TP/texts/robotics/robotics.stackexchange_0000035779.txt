Q:

Is there a reason ros::param::get does not provide a float overload?

Using ros::param recently I noticed with some frustration some frustration that it's seemingly impossible to pass a float reference to ros::param::get or ros::param::param both for the reason of the missing float overload.
It seems like such an odd omission that it makes me wonder if it's intentional. Anyone have any idea?
I filed a bug report here:

Yep, definitely a duplicate. But, like you it seems, I'm not sure I understand the reasoning given.
