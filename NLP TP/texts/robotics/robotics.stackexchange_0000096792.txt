Q:

how to set parameters in ndt_mapping while my velodyne is slant to create 3D Map

I want to generate 3D point cloud map in my campus,and my velodyne_16 is fixed to the car at a certain Angle,how can I set the parameters in ndt_mapping to genrate a better map.

A:

I am assuming you mean the transfrom between the velodyne and the base_link (vehicle coordinates). You can use the GUI (roslaunch runtime_manager runtime_manager.launch) to set the ros parameters that NDT mappings uses for the transform between the sensor and base_link..
or you can just set the rosparams in a terminal using "rosparam set param_name value".
The parameter names are: tf_x ,tf_y, tf_z, tf_yaw, tf_pitch, tf_roll. These could be set in a launch file also.
