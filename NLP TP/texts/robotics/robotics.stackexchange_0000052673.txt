Q:

is the changelog used anywhere inside bloom?

Based on the instructions on the release page here, I've run the following commands:
catkin_generate_changelog
catkin_tag_changelog
catkin_prepare_release
bloom-release foo --track hydro --rosdistro hydro

After performing the release, I noticed that the updates to the changelog had not been committed to my upstream repo by any script. I assume I can commit then now to the development branch, and that the changelog itself is not used by bloom?
Thanks!!

A:

Bloom will take the changelog and populate the debian changelog.  It won't break anything but you will not have all the information available for this release.  It's probably not worth a new release.

@tfoote: Looks like you need to update your answer given recent failures on the build farm :).

This is a regression in bloom.  It should be padding out empty changelogs if they aren't filled by the maintainers: https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/bloom/issues/171

Ah understood. I'll pay attention to committing the changelog till bloom 0.4.3 comes out.
