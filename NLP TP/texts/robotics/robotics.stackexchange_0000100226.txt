Q:

ROS2 list publishers and subscribers

When you do rostopic info /some/topic in ROS1 it lists all the nodes that publish or subscribe to this topic.
ROS2 does the same, except it only output how many publisher or subscribers are on this topic. Is it somehow possible to get the full list of all publishers and subscribers?
$ ros2 topic info /odom
Type: nav_msgs/msg/Odometry
Publisher count: 0
Subscription count: 1

I mean it is possible to use ros2 node info on all nodes an see if they are subscribed, but this is tedious if you have a large number of nodes.
