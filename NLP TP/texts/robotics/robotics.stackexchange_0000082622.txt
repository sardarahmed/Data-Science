Q:

realsense depthimage to laserscan

Hello all,
I recently got a realsense R200 sensor. I was able to follow this tutorial and able to get data from the realsense. But I want to get laserscan data from the realsense. So I followed this tutorial.
This is the command I used to convert depthimage to laserscan

rosrun depthimage_to_laserscan
depthimage_to_laserscan
image:=/camera/depth/image_raw
camera_info:/camera/depth/camera_info

I am able to see the scan data, but there are way too many NaN values in the data. I tried to figure out why it was happening, but I was not able to. Can someone please help me?

When I used the RealSense R200 I also had many NaN values. Same thing with two different boards and different R200's, although one of the boards was better than the other.

How did you solve it? @jayess
Comment by jayess on 2017-09-01:
We went with the board (TK1?) that gave us less NaN values. So, we didn't really solve it, but accepted it.

oh wow! I thought it was the problem with the depthto_laserscan code I am using. Thanks.

I can't say for sure what the problem is or isn't. Just be aware that it may be something less obvious like what I mentioned.
Comment by krishna43 on 2017-09-01:
when you guys moved to TK1, are you still using depthto_laserscan node to get the scan data?

A:

http://wiki.ros.org/depthimage_to_laserscan this thing says under published topics that there may be NaN values.
