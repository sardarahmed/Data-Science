Q:

Ros1 bridge for Window10

Hi,
anyone knows if it is possible to build and run Ros1 bridge under WIN10?
https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge provides only a guide how it works under linux

You're specifically asking to build it with VS/VC++/msbuild here, correct? Not Win10-WSL.
Comment by fceex on 2018-03-27:
yes that is right. Not WSL but native Win10 ROS2

A:

Since we don't have a guide how to build ROS 1 on Windows we didn't spend time on instructions for the ros1_bridge since it require you to have ROS 1 available. If you do have ROS 1 built on Windows the instructions to build the bridge are pretty much the same. You should be able to follow the non-Windows instructions closely.
