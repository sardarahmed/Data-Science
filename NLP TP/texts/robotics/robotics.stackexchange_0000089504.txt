Q:

Unable to locate package ros-lunar-rosbridge-*

Hi Guys,
I am trying to install rosbridge on Ubuntu 16.04 by running sudo apt-get install ros-lunar-rosbridge-*. However I am getting the below errror.
 Reading package lists... Done 
 Building dependency tree     
 Reading state information... Done
 E: Unable to locate package ros-lunar-rosbridge-*
 E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'ros-lunar-rosbridge-*'
 E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'ros-lunar-rosbridge-*'

Is the rosbridge not released for Lunar version ?
Also kindly let me know if rosbridge installation can be done using github link (https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite). If possible kindy let me know the procedure.
Thank you,
KK

A:

rosbridge_suite has been released into Lunar, see here.
However, that is for amd64 (ie: x86). You don't tell us what architecture you are using, so I cannot be more specific in my answer.

@gvdhoorn sorry for not providing the details. I am using intel64. On an ideal case I believe sudo apt-get install ros-lunar-rosbridge-* should work. Right ?
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-11-09:
pedantic, but: intel64 is not an architecture. Intel's 64bit processors are also called amd64.
In any case: if you've setup your apt sources correctly, you should be able to install those packages using apt, yes.
Please edit your question with more information about your OS, platform, ..

.. how you installed ROS, what the contents is of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list, what the output is of sudo apt-get update, etc.

@gvdhoorn I was able to install rosbridge by going back to basics. After setting up the sources.list and keys I was able to install rosbridge. Thank you so much for enlightening me on this error from my end.
