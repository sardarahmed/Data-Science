Q:

Fake IMU for Stage?

Is there an implementation of a fake IMU for Stage? For example, I'd like to publish IMU readings as I teleop the simulated robot.

A:

AFAIK It does not exist. In any case you can take the nav_msgs::Odometry messages sent to the /base_ground_truth topic, transform it to the IMU message and introduce manually some noise if required.
