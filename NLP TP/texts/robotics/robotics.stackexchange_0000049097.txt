Q:

Rosdep install error

After I downloaded the git from ethzasl_icp_mapping website, I executed  the commands:
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:`pwd`/ethzasl_icp_mapping
rosdep install ethzasl_icp_mapping

then I got problem as following:
stephan@stephan-VPCSD300C:~$ rosdep install ethzasl_icp_mapping
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
ethzasl_icp_mapper: Missing resource map_msgs
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/opt/ros/groovy/share
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/groovy/stacks
ROS path [3]=/home/stephan/groovy_workspace/sandbox/ethzasl_icp_mapping

could anyone teach me how to overcome this, please?THX!

A:

Likely there is something wrong with the map_msgs package in rosdep.  I would say the quickest way for you to solve your problem is to clone the map_msgs package then make sure it is in your $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and then build it.
cd /home/stephan/groovy_workspace/sandbox
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/map_msgs
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd)/map_msgs
cd map_msgs
rosmake

This should allow you to execute their final instruction rosmake ethzasl_icp_mapping

Yes, you need to have all ROS dependencies installed to be able to rosdep install a package.
