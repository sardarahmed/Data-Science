Q:

[Gazebo Garden] Black logos/icons/images

Hello all,
I just installed gazebo garden with the binaries in ubuntu 22.04, the installation went well, no errors. But I am getting this weird error where the logos/icons/images are black (screenshot below). I also tried building from source and I get the same error. I tried resintalling qt, qml, gz, my gpu driver but it didn't work. Any ideas?
