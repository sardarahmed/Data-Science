Q:

Where are the pre-indigo wiki pages for packages?

I just noticed (2017-02-01) that for a large number of wiki pages the version rockers at the top of the page no longer show any ROS versions older than Indigo. Some packages I'm certain have been around for some time: ros_comm, actionlib and fanuc.
Has something been turned off?

Edit: the wiki has been rather unstable for the past few days as well (500 errors, taking a long time to render pages, etc). Is/Was that related or just a coincidence?

A:

This is likely the result of the merge (and subsequent deployment) of ros-infrastructure/roswiki#169 (hydro hidden in ros-infrastructure/roswiki@08ecba51).
Apparenty I've not been paying attention and groovy and older have been hidden by the rocker for quite some time now.

I'll wait some time for a more authorative answer.

This seems consistent with http://status.ros.org/incidents/lxh6f9rcl1bg

Yes, I saw the commit and figured that was the cause for the 500s.
