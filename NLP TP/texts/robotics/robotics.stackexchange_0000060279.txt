Q:

Since updating ROS a few hours ago, ROS/catkin is broken

Hi all,
A couple of hours ago, I updated my system (sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade). Updates included a lot of Hydro updates as well. However since then, catkin_make always ends in an error. I tried:

Reinstalling all ROS hydro packages
Rebooting computer
Create a new catkin ws and build the empty ws:
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make -> this gives an error again.
Commenting out all my ROS related stuff in .bashrc and try again with the new catkin ws in a new terminal

The relevant lines of the error seem to be (find full output of cmake_ here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sgw9whjn2cm91l8/catkin_make_error.txt):
CMake Error at /home/koenlek/catkin_ws/build/catkin_generated/order_packages.cmake:2 (message):
  Invalid package manifest

Call Stack (most recent call first):

  CMakeLists.txt:63 (catkin_workspace)

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

I checked the qt-ros and qt-create packages, it seems like nothing has changed in the last apt-get update (no changes on their github at least), so I think it is something else causing the issues.
Anybody has any ideas how to fix this? I need to perform some tests later today, so I badly need my system to get up and running again.
It seems that answers.ros.org is experiencing some spamming spree with loads of non-sense spambot messages coming in the latest hours. Is this some hacking/ddos attempt that has caused the servers to serve me some non-working updates?
I run Ubuntu 12.04 x64 with latest updates.

A:

The issue here is that catkin is now finding the "template" package.xml in the python directory for qt-create. I don't know if this is because qt-create recently moved it or because of a change in catkin, but either way, there needs to be a CATKIN_IGNORE file as a peer to the package.xml file which is giving you problems, so that catkin doesn't try to parse it.

Thanks. Adding CATKIN_IGNORE solved it too (but more nicely than my old way). Posted a bug report here: https://github.com/stonier/qt_ros/issues/10
