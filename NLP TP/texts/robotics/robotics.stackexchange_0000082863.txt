A:

rviz would be the easy to go built-in tool to visualize .pcd and .bag files. You can do a bunch of stuff with the .pcd in rviz. Also you can use the pcd_viewer: rosrun perception_pcl pcd_viewer <filename> . Also, you can just try pcd_viewer filename if your path is all set right you should be able to visualize it. You can set the coloring using the number keys.
You can get the pcl_viewer as well by installing the pcl_tools package. Alternatively check PCL binaries.

Hi,
I have tried this solution and encountered difficulties. Error appears: [pcl::PCDReader::readHeader] No points to read. Do you have any ideas what might be wrong and how to handle this? Maybe other way of visualization.
