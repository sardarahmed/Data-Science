Q:

Anyone who has detailed documentation about the algorithms of the package navfhï¼Ÿ

I am trying to understand how the navfh works? it seems to use an improved dijkstra algorithms to get the shortest path. But I can't clear my thoughts about the details. It maintains two arrays,one is converted from costmap, the another one is potential value(what I am confused with). Anyone who knows well may can help me?

A:

Have you read the ICRA2010 paper linked from the main navigation wiki page?
P.S. - if you're asking questions about a package, please spell the name of the package correctly.
