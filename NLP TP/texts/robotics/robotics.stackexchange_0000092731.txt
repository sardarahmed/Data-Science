Q:

Is it possible to control Dynamixel X series motors using Raspberry Pi?

I am looking to use Dynamixel X series motors (XM-430) for a torque control application. Since they are supported by ROS, I wanted to know if I can use RPi to control them, or do I need to invest in a dedicated controller board like OpenCR?
I appreciate your help.

A:

you can use the Pi. But you need a usb-rs485 or an ttl3.3v -> rs485 converter
