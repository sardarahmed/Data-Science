Q:

Worries about Groovy

Hi All,
I am swing between Groovy and Fuerte. I have been using Fuerte for a while, but want to try Groovy now. It seems that ROS is neither forward compatible or backward compatible. Is it possible such case happen: One camera driver works on Fuerte but won't work on Groovy??
Or are there any other critical issues if I transfer to Groovy?
Thank you very much for your answers!

Which camera driver?

A:

Regarding the cameras. Upgrading ROS should not give any problems unless you upgrade OS as well. All of the camera packages in ROS I am aware of are either rely on OpenCV, Video4Linux or GStreamer and if these can get an access to device you would not have any problems.
It is also possible that some specific packages are not ported to Groovy API yet, but I believe the vast majority of those you may need are ready.

Thank you so much for your answer, Boris. My understanding from your words is that the functions we usuallly need won't affect us when transfering to Groovy, like drivers for hardwares, navigation packages, etc.  right?

The things you mention work fine on Groovy. Almost all released Ubuntu packages are available: http://www.ros.org/debbuild/groovy.html
