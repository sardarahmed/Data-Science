Q:

Where do I find gazebo message structure?

I need to know how does the msgs::SonarStamped message look like, but can't find it in documentation. How can I find it?

A:

Here's the documentation for all messages: http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/msg-api/9.0.0/classes.html

Thank you. I can't really find the structure of the message. Does it really not exist anywhere? Can I get it other way like ROS messages with rosmsg show?

Oh you're right, the documentation looks really bad: http://osrf-distributions.s3.amazonaws.com/gazebo/msg-api/9.0.0/sonar__stamped_8proto.html

Here's the source code: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/gazebo9/gazebo/msgs/sonar_stamped.proto

Thank you! The source code was sufficient to get the information I needed.
