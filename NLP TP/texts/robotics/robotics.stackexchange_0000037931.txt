Q:

why willow can not login psql

Dear All.
when I use ubuntu 11.04 or 10.04 to install ros pr2 electric package, I try to use the psql database with the following link:
http://www.ros.org/wiki/sql_database/Tutorials/Installing%20a%20PostgreSQL%20Server
But unfortunately, willow can not log in psql.
1. sudo apt-get install postgresql
2. psql
3. CREATE ROLE willow LOGIN CREATEDB CREATEROLE PASSWORD 'willow';
4.add the following into pg_hba.conf
willow user can connect locally with password
local   all         willow                            md5
5. restart computer
6. psql --username willow --password --dbname postgres
The result is that:
root@ubuntu:~# psql --username willow --password --dbname postgres
Password for user willow:
psql: FATAL:  Ident authentication failed for user "willow"
Whether I use postgres or other os user to log in ubuntu, the result is the same.
It seems that I did not create the willow user.
What I do is just start the server use psql or psql --username postgres
Then I create the user and the \q.
So I didnot know how to solve this problem.
OR where can I get a good demo instruction to run the grasp and place demo on ubuntu 11.04 0r 10.04.
The problem is how to setup the database.
Best regards.

Answer by myself:
Though it does not work, but just forward your step, you can also get what you want to use the database.
