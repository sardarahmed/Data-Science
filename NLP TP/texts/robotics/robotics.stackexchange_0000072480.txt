Q:

How can I install unique_identifier package?

Hi all,
I want to install turtlebot based on the instructions stated here "http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Turtlebot%20Installation", (section 2.3.2).
However, when I want to catkin_make rocon I get this Error "Messages depends on unknown pkg: uuid_msgs (Missing
find_package(uuid_msgs?))".
Unfortunately, "sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-uuid_msgs" or "sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-unique_identifier" give
Unable to locate package ros-indigo...
I appreciate if you can help me.
Thanks.

A:

uuid_msgs is released into ROS Indigo.
You have the install command wrong. This needs to be:
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-uuid-msgs ros-indigo-unique-identifier

Note that all underscores (_) have been replaced by dashes (-)!
You can also install all specified (i.e. it depends on the package.xmls being correct) dependencies via:
rosdep install --from-paths <catkin_ws/src> -i

EDIT
You need to have your sources set up correctly.
Follow the instructions on the ROS wiki, especially 1.1-1.3, and then do a sudo apt-get update.
If you can then tab-complete the ros-indigo-... part of the install command, everything will work fine.
If not, you probably still haven't set this up correctly

see edit above.

I should say that I have already tried sudo apt-get update.
Comment by Reza1984 on 2016-03-03:
The "rosdep install --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src -i" gives me
"#All required rosdeps installed successfully"
Comment by Reza1984 on 2016-03-03:
Ok I try to check if the sources set up correctly or not. Thanks again

Is ~/catkin_ws/src your workspace? This obviously needs to be replaced with the directory where you cloned the other sources.
Can you post (edit your question), the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list?

Thanks a lot, I tried to source the set up again and used "sudo apt-get update --fix- missing". I could install.
But it's strange as before that package I could install navigation package without any problem!
