Q:

gazebo UDRF tutorial dies

Hi all, I'm following the tutorial here,
http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_urdf
and running,
roslaunch rrbot_description rrbot_rviz.launch
I can see the robot in rviz and the window with the sliders, but the sliders don't do anything, and rviz shows errors that there are no tf transforms.   Is this a bug in the tutorial or the git code, or could anything be wrong with my setup?

A:

Answering own question for future reference -- it started working when I restarted roscore and relaunched, possibly due to an old Gazebo run having left some messages or nodes active.
