Q:

load yaml with code

Is there a way to load a .yaml file in python directly to the parameter server? I want to do something like "rosparam load", but programmatically, as a callback for an event in a GUI.
Thanks in advance

This is duplicate of http://answers.ros.org/question/58819/programatically-load-yaml-config-file-to-the-parameter-server/, there is an answer there.

A:

You should be able to load a YAML file into a python data structure using the pyyaml module.
You can then use rospy.set_param('/prefix', data) to push the entire contents of your data structure to a prefix on the parameter server.

It's not the same as doing "rosparam load" . I've tried what you propose, but it does not make the namespace structure as "rosparam load" does. I mean, with "rosparam load file.yaml" I load all the namespaces in the file, that is, the data I can access is just the leaves of the structure. and all the internal nodes in the file are loaded as namespaces. With rospy.set_param, I just set the "/prefix" with a dictionary, so I can't access the data with rospy.get_param("/prefix/namespace1/namespace2").

That's a bit surprising. What sort of structure/namespaces do you get on the parameter server after uploading a dict with set_param? It might be worth adding what you've tried to your question, particularly a small piece of python and the resulting rosparam list /prefix and rosparam get /prefix
