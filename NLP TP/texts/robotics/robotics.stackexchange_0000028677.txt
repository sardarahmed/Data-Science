Q:

Gazebo9 hangs on "Preparing Your World..." on macOS Mojave 10.14.1

I seemed to have solved the GUI scaling issue by installing the latest version of qt (5.12.0) but now Gazebo hangs at preparing your world (for hours).  It doesn't seem to be downloading any models, /usr/local/share/gazebo-8/models only contains ground_plane and sun.  I've tried manually copying all the model folders there but it doesn't help.
This is on both Gazebo8 and Gazebo9

For me the workaround has been so far to switch between Qt 5.12.0 for RViz and 5.11.2 for Gazebo where the UI is overscaled but kind of usable anyway.

I see others are aware of it and working on it here: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/2531/gazebo-gui-rendering-is-scaled

FYI, I am getting the same problem.

Did you see my answer that minimizing the window fixes it?

A:

Minimizing the window and opening it back up fixes the issue.  Sounds like there's a bug fix already submitted.
