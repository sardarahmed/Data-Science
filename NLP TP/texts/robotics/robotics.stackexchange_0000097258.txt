Q:

How to get to the correct documentation page?

Suppose I'm trying to look up the documentation for geometry_msgs.

I start from https://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/ (which I perceive to be the root of the ros documentation)
Find the geometry_msgs folder (https://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/)
Open the html folder (https://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/)

However, that is just a dummy page.  The correct page I'm expecting is actually http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/index-msg.html
I couldn't quite figure out a way to get to that page from the documentation root and the only way of getting to the correct page is by googling.  It seems rather unintuitive that the correct documentation pages can only be found by google and not by navigating through the documentation itself.  This also makes finding less commonly linked documentation (which may not appear in google searches) more difficult.

A:

You'd go to wiki/geometry_msgs and click on Msg API in the Package Links box in top right of the page.
That takes you directly to docs.ros.org/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/index-msg.html.

I start from https://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/ (which I perceive to be the root of the ros documentation)

Personally I would consider the ROS wiki to be "the root of the ros documentation" for ROS 1.
For ROS 2, it would be the ROS Index.

Thanks for the answer. Somewhat unrelated, but is there a reason why the Code API pages don't have a search bar?

I wouldn't know.
Probably because it has not been enabled in the Doxygen config file template used by the doc generation infrastructure.
Perhaps if you open a PR this could be changed.
