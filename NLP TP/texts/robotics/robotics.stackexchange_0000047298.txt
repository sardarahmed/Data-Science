Q:

Attachments in ROS wiki not working

Citing the ROS Wiki Attachments page:
"Attached Files
To refer to attachments on a page, use attachment:filename, as shown below in the list of files. Do NOT use the URL of the [get] link, since this is subject to change and can break easily."
However, I get a 500 Internal Server Error whenever I link that way (example here). The [get] link, on the other hand, works fine.
Who should I contact to get this fixed? The 500 Internal Server Error page only refers to webmaster@localhost (i.e. no contact info is provided).

Please consider this post: https://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20120308.185442.3620b6de.en.html and avoid attachments where possible.

@KruseT: Thanks for this, I was not aware of that message since I signed up to ros-users only a couple months later. In this case, however, the attachment is legitimate because I have no control over the repository for the package and it is quite useful to users (it's a patch to get it to work).

If possible paste the patch online (e.g. github gist) and just add a link to that file in the wiki.

A:

Please open an issue for the ROS wiki.
