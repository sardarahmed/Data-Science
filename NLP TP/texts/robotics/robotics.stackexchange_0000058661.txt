Q:

Nao microphones and google API in ROS

Hello,
I would like to implement a speech detection which will send sentences to the google API and get the text. This will be permanently listening and doesn't need any vocabulary. so before starting I thought it would be better to ask maybe somebody already did something like that.

I'm looking for something like you, have you tried the package audio_common?
http://wiki.ros.org/audio_common
It should catch the sound from the microphones and publish an /audio message.
Let us know if it works.

A:

A similar thing has been done here https://github.com/Barista-Bot/voice-control in python.
This wasn't on a Nao but our own proprietary robot.
Hope it may be of use.
