Q:

Cannot locate python node

When executing my launch file, I get the error
ERROR: cannot launch node of type [package/node.py]: Cannot locate node of type [node.py] in package [robot]
for every node in the launch file. This script was working about 8 hours ago, and no files have been changed. Tried re-running rosmake.
using roslib.packages.findnode returns nothing for any node/package pair in the project.

A:

If no files have been changed, it's a bit of mystery, but the only time I have run into this error in the past when a node script is really in the right place pointed to by the launch file is that the execute bit on the script is not set.  To fix: "chmod 755 node.py".  But I'm guessing you have already checked this.  You could also try running "make clean" followed by "rosmake" in the package directory as well as "rospack profile".

+1 I had an similar problem with a ros launch-file. chmod 744 node.launch did the magic for me.
