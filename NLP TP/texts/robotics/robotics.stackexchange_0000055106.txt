Q:

How can I use my own .msg?

I've created my own .msg and can perform "rosmsg show MyMessage".
The question is how can I use it in my C++ code?
I've seen this link that is exactly the same question (http://answers.ros.org/question/31779/how-to-use-a-message-that-i-made/) however I don't really get it all. =(
Why is there a Header header in the .msg file? Is it "standard" to have in a msg?
Where Is the MyMessage.h file saved? How do I create It? I can only find the .msg file. Since I can't find it I cant Include it in the cpp file naturally.
It also states that I should add the line  in the manifest. When I do this i get an error saying:

The manifest must not contain the following tags: depend

How can I solve this?
Many Thanks, Patrik

A:

1/ manifest.xml is now package.xml.
Your should look like this one:
https://github.com/ros/catkin_tutorials/blob/master/create_package_pubsub/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/package.xml
As the syntax changed the link you mention is now obsolete.
See the tutorial example here:

2/ A header is used to associate a timestamp and/or a frame with your message, this is very useful but not mandatory.
3/ Once you run cmake in your package, a directory called msg_gen will be created containing the headers and required source files. You don't have to really know where this directory is located. Just include #include <PACKAGE/MESSAGE> where PACKAGE is you package name and MESSAGE your message filename without the extension (mymsg.msg becomes mymsg).

Thanks for the quick response Thomas! I still have some trouble though, I explained it in the following question: http://answers.ros.org/question/95541/error-when-trying-to-use-my-own-msg/
