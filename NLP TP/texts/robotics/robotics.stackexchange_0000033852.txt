Q:

Know if you are dropping messages from a subscriber queue?

Is there a way to know when or how many messages are being dropped from a subscriber queue?
I'm mostly interested in occasionally reporting that node foo has dropped N packets since execution began.

A:

For messages that have a header field, I would think you could check that header.seq increments by only 1 for each message received. This is assuming all the messages are coming from a single publisher--there might also be some other wrinkles that don't spring immediately to mind.

Actually, I was wondering if I had to use the header sequence for exactly this reason.  I was avoiding putting the header in since the rest of the information isn't useful.  I suppose you could always just add and set your own seq integer if you didn't want to use the full header.

Checking the header field could work if you have only one publisher, but breaks down if more than one node is publishing messages on a topic.
