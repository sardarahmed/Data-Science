Q:

How to run rosdistro command?

I use ubuntu 12.04 64 bits with ROS groovy.
I followed rosdistro page.
I install rosdistro by these commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-rosdistro

But I still can't run rosdistro on terminal.
sam@sam:~/code/groovy_overlay/devel/bin$rosdistro
rosdistro: command not found
sam@sam:~/code/groovy_overlay/devel/bin$

I found I have two tool similar with rosdistro:
rosdistro_build_cache  rosdistro_reformat

How to solve it?
Thank you~

I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 64bits with ROS Indigo, and I'm facing the same situation as you. Did you find a way to call "rosdistro [command]" on the terminal?

A:

It seems the rosdistro script was marked as obsolete on https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdistro/commit/e49f56162e0105eb81abf3ba805b3b06e635e74c, but no reason was informed and the docs weren't updated. As the script was commented out from setup.py, it is not installed anymore.

Promoted as a right answer. I also added an obsolete notice on the wiki page referenced in OP.
