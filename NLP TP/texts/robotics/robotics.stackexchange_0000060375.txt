Q:

Remocon Hydro Android app/Turtlebot Pairing error

hi all.
I''m encountering a problem now when pairing my android device with the turtlebot. Using the Robot Remocon App (hydro), i managed to detect the turtlebot under "Scan the local network". After loading,  it instantly display this error:

org.ros.exception.RosRuntimeException:
timed out waiting for a gateway_info
publication

<--screenshot image here--> = http: //tinypic.com/view.php?pic=5wuv7&s=8
However, i did set my ROS_IP/ROS_HOSTNAME/ROS_MASTER_URI on the turtlebot for multi-device-pc communication as the ros wiki tutorial states = (http: //wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/hydro/Network%20Configuration).
any help will be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance guys.
tried following the answer to a similar question "here" =
http: //answers.ros.org/question/110196/android-rocon_app_manager-pairing-error/
but to no avail. (so i decided to bring this up again)
insufficient karma to post links. sigh

I asked a similar question there...are you by chance using an android that exposes two network interfaces?
Comment by syaz nyp fyp on 2014-07-01:
ive checked and i doubt it's exposing to 2 network interfaces.
Either ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME needs to be set in bashrc right? just one will do? and it's supposed to be ROS_HOSTNAME=IP_OF_TURTLEBOT? am i right? I've done it. I'm really confused on what seems to be the problem now. thks a lot daniel

Finally got it working. Thanks to everyone.
For the machine that is running roscore, you need not need to worry about ROS_MASTER_URI or ROS_HOSTNAME but you need to select the IP of your machine on the internal network. Exporting ROS_IP in ~/.bashrc

export ROS_IP=172.20.10.8

Need to make sure that ROS_IP is also set in the etc/hosts file by adding:

172.20.10.8      ROS_IP
