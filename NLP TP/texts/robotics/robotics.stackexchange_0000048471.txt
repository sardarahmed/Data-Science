Q:

Define a topic for a Plot in a rqt_gui perspective

I've created a perspective in rqt_gui with several Plot plugins. However, each time I open the perspective, all the Plot plugins appear in its correct position but the topic they have to plot is not stored. There is a way to set the topics and avoid to define them every time?
Thank you!

A:

Hi narcispr,
if you launch rqt_gui when not all topics are being published yet, the plugins that depend on a topic will require you to set that topic again, but if you launch rqt_gui at the end, when everything is published, then your saved setup will keep track of the same topics.

First, open all nodes and rqt_gui
and set it up as you like.

Then, close rqt_gui first, then all nodes.

When you need to work again, run
first all nodes, then rqt_gui.

That works for me.
