Q:

How to change light intensity using a plugin

Gazebo 7 recently had an update that allowed lights be added to robot models as children of links:
https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2807/add-light-as-child-of-link/diff%3C/p%3E
The SDF spec supports things like light shape, distance, and attenuation, but the robot I'm working on has dimmable lights, and so far I haven't been able to find out how to change the light intensity using the gazebo API. I looked in gazebo:physics API and I was able to find the Light class as well as the LightState class, but those don't seem to govern the settings I'm looking for.

A:

You should look into rendering::Light. There's an explanation here about the Light's multiple personalities.
