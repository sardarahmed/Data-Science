Q:

Skipped loading plugin with error: XML Document '.../nodelet_plugins.xml' has no Root Element. This likely means the XML is malformed or missing

I issue this command:
roslaunch stdr_launchers server_with_map_and_gui_plus_robot.launch

And the get the error:
[ERROR] [1516990762.757066973]: Skipped loading plugin with error: XML Document '/opt/ros/kinetic/share/gmapping/nodelet_plugins.xml' has no Root Element. This likely means the XML is malformed or missing..

Seems like that's not supposed to be happening. Any ideas?
