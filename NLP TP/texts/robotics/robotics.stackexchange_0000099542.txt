Q:

Different version of Python. Will Python 3.8.9 work? 3.9?

In the directions for installing ROS 2 it says to install Python 3.8.3. For multiple reasons I can only install 3.8.9. Will this work?

A:

It might, but it might not, it hasn't been tested and we can't recomend it. We list very specific confirations in REP 2000 and in the install instructions. If you really can't change your system python try installing ROS in a VM or a container. You'll have a much better user experience, especially if you are new to ROS.
