Q:

Using Boost::boost::asio::ip::udp from a model plugin

Hi everyone,
I'm trying top use a custom UDP socket to control a model. The outgoing (from Plugin) messages are received but the plugins doesn't receive anything from the source. The messages are being queued. It's not the port because I tried to use the code outside gazebo and it works.
Any idea why, and how to fix this?
Thx!

A:

The solution is to move the receiver to a thread (tested) or use the IO_service of gazebo (access via IOManager) (non-tested)
The porblem is that the same thread cannot access io_services via two different boost::io_services
