Q:

ros_lib not created installing arduino

running a fresh install of hydro on a fresh install of ubuntu Precise.  According to the tutorial at http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
under 3.3 Install ros_lib into the Arduino Environment
"The preceding installation steps created ros_lib, which must be copied into the Arduino build environment to enable Arduino programs to interact with ROS."
ros_lib was not created. any ideas? I rechecked everything in the install, all is well, no error messages etc.
Also, it says to put ros_lib in the libraries folder of the sketchbook. My libraries are at /usr/share/arduino/libraries
Does it matter?
regards, Richard

A:

The ros_lib should be installed in your Arduino "sketchbook/libraries". To install the ros_lib in the sketchbook use rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py <sketchbook>/libraries/ . You will have to make the libraries folder and the sketchbook should automatically be generated in the home directory after the Arduino IDE is opened once.
