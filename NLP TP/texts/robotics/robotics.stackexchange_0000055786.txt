Q:

Hi , I have error during examinig simple publisher & subscriber (c++)

I use groovy distribution & catkin
first , I wrote the simple publisher & subscriber example that in beginner tutorials
then I tried to examine it following the following steps

typing command roscore in catkin

I made sure I have sourced my
workspace's setup.sh file after
calling catkin_make but before

trying to  my  applications:
>  In your catkin workspace
>      cd ~/catkin_ws    
>      source ./devel/setup.bash

run the node talker using command

rosrun beginner_tutorials talker

but, when I typed command rosrun beginner_tutorials talker
I recevied in output:
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/eman/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials

even though the node talker exists in the src of begibnner_turorials package
& my CMakeLists.txt file looks like that:-
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
project(beginner_tutorials)

any help,please
I wonder what is the reason for having that error??

I made sure that Ros can find my
package ( beginner_tutorials ) using command
rospack find beginner_tutorials & it
returns its path

/home/eman/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials

so, that mean ros can see & find my package .

I also made sure that the code of 2
nodes talker & listener exits in the
src folder of my package

, but when I tried to build the code
using command catkin_make

typing 1st command cd ~/catkin_ws/src

then typing 2nd command catkin_make

I had that error :-
> The specified base path
> "/home/eman/catkin_ws/src" contains a
> CMakeLists.txt but "catkin_make" must
> be invoked in the root of workspace

I tried also

1-typing 1st command cd ~/catkin_ws

2- then typing 2nd command   catkin_make

but,  I had error
  CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/roscpp/cmake/roscppConfig.cmake:130 (message):
  Project 'beginner_tutorials' tried to find library 'pthread'.  The library
  is neither a target nor built/installed properly.  Did you compile project
  'roscpp'? Did you find_package() it before the subdirectory containing its

make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
Invoking "make cmake_check_build_system" failed

what should I do ??
should I rebuild the catkin_ws & the package???

Do you see build output from your node when executing catkin_make? In your src folder there only should be the source code of your node, because catkin does out-of-source-builds.

@BennyRe
firstly, thank you very much for your help & your note.God bless you amen After I had executed catkin_make , I had the following output eman@eman-K52F:~$ catkin_make Base path: /home/eman Source space: /home/eman/src Build space: /home/eman/build Devel space: /home/eman/devel Install space: /home/eman/install #### #### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/eman/build" #### #### #### Running command: "make -j4 -l4" in "/home/eman/build" #### eman@eman-K52F:~$ you mean by src folder ( the src folder of the package beginner_tutorials ) ??? am I right ?

I made sure that the code of  2 nodes ( talker & listener ) are found in the src folder of the package beginner_tutorials
,but I still having the same error
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named talker below /home/eman/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials
I am really sorry for disturbance , but I have the same error & I don't know what to do
Comment by BennyRe on 2013-12-01:
The output of catkin_make looks strange. There should be some output of your package. Did you create the package and your workspace correctly. Did you follow the catkin workspace tutorial? I mean, because your src/build/devel folders are located directly in your home folder.
Comment by lindzey on 2013-12-02:
It'll probably help if you can edit your question to include your CMakeLists.txt file.

Thank you very much for your response . God bless you amen.
I am sorry for being late to reply , but I had  a problem with my internet connection .
I suppose I created the package and my workspace correctly  .
&yes,  I followed  the catkin workspace tutorial and every thing was going well similar to the outputs of the tutorial at that time .

The output may look strange because I didn't type the command " cd ~/catkin_ws/ before typing command " catkin_make " I am not sure about that ,but may be that was the reason. That output after 1-typing command " cd ~/catkin_ws/ " 2- then typing command " catkin_make " eman@eman-K52F:~/catkin_ws/src$ cd ~/catkin_ws/ eman@eman-K52F:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make Base path: /home/eman/catkin_ws Source space: /home/eman/catkin_ws/src Build space: /home/eman/catkin_ws/build Devel space: /home/eman/catkin_ws/devel Install space: /home/eman/catkin_ws/install #### #### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "/home/eman/catkin_ws/build" #### -- Using CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX: /home/eman/catkin_ws/devel -- Using CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: /home/eman/catkin_ws/devel;/opt/ros/groovy -- This workspace overlays: /home/eman/catkin_ws/devel;/opt/ros/groovy -- Using Debian Python package layout -- Using CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING: ON -- Call enable_testing()

but there is error at the end of the output -- +++ processing catkin package: 'beginner_tutorials' -- ==> add_subdirectory(beginner_tutorials) CMake Error at /opt/ros/groovy/share/roscpp/cmake/roscppConfig.cmake:130 (message): Project 'beginner_tutorials' tried to find library 'pthread'.

@lindzey
Thank you for your response & your note . God bless you amen . Ok , I will edit my question to include my CMakeLists.txt file
Comment by BennyRe on 2013-12-02:
Please put the content of your CMakeLists.txt into a code environment. It's very hard to read at the moment.
Comment by BennyRe on 2013-12-03:
Thanks joq. Don't have enough karma to edit.

You should always be able to edit your own question. If that does not work, send an admin message.

Sorry  I tried to edit it ,but it didn't work
& Thanks alot for your response . I really appreciate that . God bless you amen.

@joq
Thanks alot for your edit , I really appreciate that . God bless you amen
& Thanks for your note , I will take care about that

A:

Based on your most recent update:

typing 1st command cd ~/catkin_ws/src

then typing 2nd command catkin_make

Your problem is that you need to invoke catkin_make in catkin_ws not catkin_ws/src.
However, this is a different mistake than some of the other error messages you've posted would indicate.
