Q:

convert multiple .pcd files into one PCD file

Hello everyone,
whenever I try to convert .bag file using the following command:
rosrun pcl_ros bag_to_pcd input_file.bag topic output_directory
to pcd file, I am getting multiple pcd files.
How can I obtain single pcd file from a bag file, using point_cloud_assembler. Or I should use laser_cloud_assembler?
I think my .bag file contains point clouds, so that I should extract data in order to create .pcd file. After I want to use this pcd file to convert it into stl file in cloudcompare in order to use it gazebo world

have you solved this. ?

A:

You can use laser_cloud_assembler. I think link text and link text this will help you. After doing this hopefully you will get one PCD Data then you can use cloudcompare to convert into stl file and you can import that stl file in the gazebo.
