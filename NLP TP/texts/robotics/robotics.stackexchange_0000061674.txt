Q:

Should i create stack for package with extras?

Some time ago i released base package, mavros.
Now i have additional package with extras. It require cv_bridge and absolutely optional.
Also i plan to do some rqt plugins for mavros, so it is another package.
Should i make stack from that packages? How to do it?
How to keep package naming?
Update: stacks are gone, but i mean same schema, when all packages stored in one repo.

A:

If you're using catkin: Stacks don't exist anymore. They have been replaced by Metapackages.
Edit:
Yes just do it. Put all packages in one repository and if you like add a Metapackage.
