Q:

OMPL_ros_interface on Hydro

I'd like to use OMPL library on ROS Hydro to implement OMPL motion planning on Turtlebot. I found the package OMPL_ros_interface but is available in Groovy and not in Hydro. Is there other package for Hydro? Is there alternative to use OMPL library in ROS?
I would avoid MoveIt because I don't use any arm, but I just have to move the base.
Thanks.

A:

OMPL is integrated into MoveIt. MoveIt is not specific to arms, it's just most commonly used with arms.

I would use MoveIt with Turtlebot, because I would like to use a new planner for path planning. Is It possible?
I'm following moveIt tutorial, but I'm not able to configure the base motion. The robot can move transversely, which is impossible in reality.
