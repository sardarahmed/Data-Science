nice, didn't know that :-)

Even quicker fix: CTRLl-\ to directly send a sigkill.

I have seen this being discussed (and fixed) for nodelets, but for me it happens also for regular nodes. Quick Fix: Ctrl+Z to send process to background, Then "kill %1" to kill the background process.

A:

Perhaps you don't check for ros::ok()? If you don't, then Ctrl-C won't kill your node.

Yes, spin() does the ros::ok() check.

I have the problem too. I'm using the multithreaded spinner (but I think I also had it with other spinners), so I'm just calling spin(), which should to the ros::ok check, shouldn't it?
