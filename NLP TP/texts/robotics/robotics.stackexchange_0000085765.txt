Distributor ID: Ubuntu

Release:    16.04
Codename:   xenial

rosversion -d
kinetic

I am trying to install required packages, first I did an update:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Then did:

Did you try sudo apt-get update first before trying to install packages?
Comment by engineerdream on 2018-03-09:
yes, I did (just updated) but still have the issue

A:

The solution I found was to remove ros completely and reinstall

sudo apt-get remove ros-*

sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros_kinetic.sh && chmod 755 ./install_ros_kinetic.sh && bash ./install_ros_kinetic.sh

That removal was likely not necessary and only removed the main packages. But rerunning the install script probably fixed your apt sources somehow.
