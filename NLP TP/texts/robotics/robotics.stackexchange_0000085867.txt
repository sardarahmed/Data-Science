Q:

Sending only one topic to another computer

Hello,
We are trying to publish only one topic from raspberry pi to an offboard computer recently.The topic contains image data acquire by the onboard camera, and we want to use the data to calculate the control command. Setting our offboard computer as ROS Master seems not to be a good solution, because it would send all of the topics, and this may cause serious network delay.
Does anyone know how to send a single topic to another computer?
Both raspberry pi and offboard computer are Ubuntu16.04, Kinetic

I think the ROS Master is only responsible for setting up the initial peer-to-peer connection between a publisher/subscriber when calls are made to advertise/subscribe, then the communicating nodes send and receive messages directly over TCP. Therefore, you should only have to think about topics published by nodes on the Raspberry Pi and subscribed to by nodes on the offboard computer or vice-versa, not all of the topics in your whole system.

Yes, you're right. I'm new to ROS. I may have misunderstood some basic concepts. However, when I perform formation control, some topics seem to have lost information. Is this related to the setting of queue and buffer?

In order to help, I need to know what exactly do you mean by "lost information"?
If you think you chose the wrong queue size, have a look at this: http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Publishers%20and%20Subscribers#Choosing_a_good_queue_size
It's a rospy page, but still applicable to C++.
