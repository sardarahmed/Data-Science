Q:

Has anyone attempted to install vicon_bridge on an ubuntu mate running on a raspberry pi? Seems to have a compatibility issue when making

Error reads /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /home/atrv/catkin_ws/src/vicon_bridge/vicon_sdk/Vicon_SDK_1.3_Linux/32-bit/libViconDataStreamSDK_CPP.so when searching for -lViconDataStreamSDK_CPP
Seems to be only an issue with raspberry pi, or ARM boards in general? I have successfully used vicon_bridge with my laptop and pc.
Hope someone have some suggestions? Or perhaps I should look for a substitution for the R-pi?
Thanks!

A:

It looks like the pre-compiled Vicon library that is part of that package is compiled for Intel processors, and won't work on ARM.
I don't know anything about Vicon, but it would be worth checking their website to see if the provide a version of their SDK that is compiled for ARM.
You may also want to check the github issues for the vicon_bridge package to see if anyone else has reported this before.

Ahh thanks! Seems like that is indeed the case and seems like I am out of luck for now.
