Q:

Kinect Xbox360 + Beaglebone Black + ROS

I want to capture the depth and rgb images using kinect xbox360 with beaglebone black using ROS packages. I have so far been successful in doing so on my laptop, using the openni_launch package. But I cannot make it happen in the same way on Beaglebone Black. What shall I have to do differently to get this thing working?
I am kind of new to ROS. So can you please help me out? Is it at all possible to run the kinect with beaglebone black? I found many people are saying that It cannot be done. But why? I also found some videos of kinect working with Beagleboard-xM. Why does it not work with Beaglebone black then?
Any help will be appreciated.
Thank you.

I tried that too... But had same result... Is it at all possible to run the kinect with beaglebone black? I could not find anyone doing it. People used beagleboard-xM but not beaglebone black..
