Q:

Giving goal points without using rviz

In various scenarios we need to give goals to the robot and using rviz is the most popular way to do it in the ROS community. However, in various low level processors (viz. Raspberry Pi and other ARM processors) or in a bare bones installation one may not have the luxury of getting OGRE working, hence no rviz. So, what options do we have then, is it possible to give goal points using some other means ?
Typically a command line execution as
[rospackage] [executable] [goal-x, goal-y]
may be very useful, does such exist ?

A:

From you command, I assume you mean without a GUI?
In that case, just do what rviz does: It sends a message to a topic (usually /move_base_simple/goal). You can do the same via rostopic pub.
A wrapper script that expects x,y,theta could be easily done.
From software, you should use the actionlib interface.

@dornhege I see what you are getting at !! seems possible, do you guess the command structure I have suggested can indeed be implemented ? [rospackage] [executable] [goal-x, goal-y] ??

Sure. Just write a wrapper script that takes x,y and calls rostopic pub with the correct parameters fed in. If you put that script in a ROS package, you'll have exactly the syntax you wanted.
