Q:

Node management tool

Does anyone know about a node management GUI. Something that allows
you to get an overview of the running nodes, manage starting and stopping
nodes. See if any node has crashed etc. I guess you could think of it
as a GUI on top of roslaunch or something.

A:

This doesn't exist.  You're not the first to think of it and some informal design has been done, but there is nothing usable.
