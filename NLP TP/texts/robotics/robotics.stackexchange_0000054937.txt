Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: android_core

Does anyone know of any step-by-step tutorials where I can use android_core (I want to publish data from accelerometers on the phone to a robot). I can't find any that work.
After spending countless hours with android_core and rosjava, I'm ready to throw in the towel.

A:

This might not be the answer you were expecting, but if you only want to get accelerometer/gyro data from your phone into ROS have you ever checked the "ROS Sensors Driver" app in the Play Store?
Have you already tried this tutorial? http://wiki.ros.org/sig/Rosjava/Android%20Development%20Environment

yes, but it is out of date, especially the github pages. I'm not really sure about the app. It's not obvious how to use it, and more importantly, I'm not just outputting sensor data; I'm fusing it and then outputting that.
