Q:

displaying of pointcloud crashes rviz

I am using pcl and pcl_ros from
http://svn.pointclouds.org/ros/tags/unstable/perception_pcl/.
I am publishing the pointcloud version .PCD v.7 using
pcd_to_pointcloud tool and then trying to display it in diamondback
version of rviz.
The latter however crashes rviz with the following message:
"""
rviz: /tmp/buildd/ros-diamondback-visualization-common-1.4.0/debian/ros-diamondback-visualization-common/opt/ros/diamondback/stacks/visualization_common/ogre/build/ogre_src_v1-7-1/OgreMain/include/OgreAxisAlignedBox.h:252:
void Ogre::AxisAlignedBox::setExtents(const Ogre::Vector3&, const
Ogre::Vector3&): Assertion `(min.x <= max.x && min.y <= max.y && min.z
<= max.z) && "The minimum corner of the box must be less than or equal
to maximum corner"' failed.
(0) : fatal error C9999: *** exception during compilation ***
"""
I suspect it to be caused by NaNs in my pointcloud but then again this
was not the problem for diamondback version of pcl_ros.
Can anyone confirm if my guess is right and what would would the
action to rectify the problem be?
D.

Closing as Eric Perko's comment is essentially the right answer.

Could you try it on rviz trunk? If it still doesn't work there, I suggest opening a ticket and then putting a link to it here as the answer. If a valid PointCloud (according to the PointCloud2 message type) causes rviz to crash, it's definitely a bug :)

Hi Eric, the bt is here: http://pastie.org/1995774. And this is the pcd I am trying to visualize: http://ias.cs.tum.edu/~pangerci/alpen_milch_0195.pcd. It seems like the deb version of rviz is built w/o debug symbols as I am not able to get any listing of the code or such.

Could you run rviz in gdb and get a backtrace?

This might be the same issue?: http://answers.ros.org/question/928/rviz-window-closes-itself Spoiler alert, no solutions there either.
