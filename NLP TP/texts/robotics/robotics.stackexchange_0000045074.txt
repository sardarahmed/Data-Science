A:

It looks like mod_semantic_map isn't indexed properly on ros.org, but if you browse software on ros.org and go to its details page, you'll find that source is available here and a tutorial is available here.
EDIT:
You should have a look at the environment variables wiki page to understand what's happening with the failure of rosmake.
rosmake uses the variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH when looking for ROS packages to compile.  If you create or download a new package and its directory isn't on the path, rosmake won't work.
To see what the path currently is, type 'echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH'
If the directory in which you put mod_semantic_map isn't on that path, then you know that's the problem.
To add a directory to the path, type 'export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/the/directory/to/add:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH'
You may also want to put this line in your ~/.bashrc file so it will happen automatically at login.

It's a subversion repository, so you should type 'svn co https://tum-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tum-ros-pkg/knowledge/mod_semantic_map/' in whatever folder you want to download the code. Then, you'll want to rosmake the package.

BTW, mod_semantic_map depends on knowrob, so make sure you can "roscd knowrob" to knowrob stack first.

Please have a look at the first two ROS tutorials "Installing and Configuring Your ROS Environment" and "Navigating the ROS Filesystem" on this page http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials. Your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH needs to be correct for rosmake to find the packages.
