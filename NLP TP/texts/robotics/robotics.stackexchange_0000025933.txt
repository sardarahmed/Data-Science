GazeboRosOpenniKinect vs GazeboRosDepthCamera

The ROS Groovy simulator_gazebo package has both GazeboRosOpenniKinect and GazeboRosDepthCamera plugins. Which one is preferred? What is the difference?

Is there any way so that the camera does not take pictures continuously but at some discrete random intervals?
