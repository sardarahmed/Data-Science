Q:

rqt_reconfigure widget

Can the text field widget at the bottom of rqt_reconfigure window ("System message might be shown here when necessary") be interacted with? It would be very useful to display some info from the reconfigure server code callback for example

A:

As the one who added that text area, I don't think I finished integration of it with the top pane, and I'm not aware if anyone completed it (Just skimmed through rqt_reconfigure/issues but I haven't found anyone mentioned that text area.
I think feature change is welcomed on the repo I linked above. The text area not taking any input from anywhere should be considered as a bug, so bugfix to it should still be acceptable (new features for core pkgs in ROS1 like rqt_reconfigure aren't accepted as much).
