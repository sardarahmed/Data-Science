Q:

Finding an Item in a Point Cloud

Hello All,
I'm wondering if there is a implementation in ROS that would allow me to find a Object in a point cloud based off of some kind of comparison, preferably either to a Mesh object or a smaller point cloud representing the object that I'm looking for.
I've search online and it appears that there may already be an implementation, but I Can't find anything specifically documenting where it is or what it's called.

Hi,
Maybe this tutorial on template alignment from point cloud library is what you are searching for ?
Or maybe this one on 3D object recognition ?
Bests regards,
