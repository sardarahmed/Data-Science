Q:

Problems installing Hydro on Pi3 (yaml.constructor)

Hi,
I'm following the step-by-step instruction:
http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Setting%20up%20Hydro%20on%20RaspberryPi
Step:
$ rosinstall_generator ros_comm --rosdistro hydro --deps --wet-only > hydro-ros_comm-wet.rosinstall

returns error:
 File "/home/pi/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/yaml/constructor.py", line 452, in construct_undefined
    node.start_mark)
yaml.constructor.ConstructorError: could not determine a constructor for the tag 'tag:yaml.org,2002:python/str'
  in "<string>", line 5773, column 28:
        </package>\n", ar_sys: !!python/str "<?xml version=\"1. ..

Anyone has an idea how to fix that?
Thanks
Rabiato

Do you have a specific reason to want to install ROS Hydro? It's been EOL for quite some time now.

A:

I'm a beginner and want to work with the book "Learning ROS for Robotics Programming" which uses Hydro. However, I gave it a thought and guess it should work with later versions too.
I'm currently installing Melodic w/ instruction and it looks like it is working:

Thanks, I guess I close the question since it's a wast to go back in time.
