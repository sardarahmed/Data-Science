Q:

openni_tracker Timeout Error in Fuerte (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)

Hi all,
I'm trying to execute the openni_tracker node in ROS Fuerte running a Ubuntu 12.04 fresh install. When I launch the node I get the following error (full log at the end of the question):
[ERROR] [1340212031.075733079]: InitFromXml failed: Got a timeout while waiting for a network command to complete!

I have found other posts with a similar problem in Fuerte running (x)Ubuntu 12.04:
http://answers.ros.org/question/35956/openni_tracker-with-kinect-for-windows/
http://answers.ros.org/question/35620/openni_tracker-fails-with-fuerte-and-xubuntu-1204/
The first one points out that it might be a bug in Fuerte when running Ubuntu 12.04. Unfortunately, their questions did not receive any response. Therefore, I want to discard a problem related with my configuration or my installation before thinking that it is a bug in Fuerte. Moreover, if this were the case, It would already have aroused more noise from the community.
I'll appreciate any help that you can provide me, including if you are using this node in Fuerte with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
Thanks,
VÃ­ctor.
