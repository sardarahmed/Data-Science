Q:

Writing an ethernet driver for TiM551

I found this driver for the TiM551
http://wiki.ros.org/sick_tim3xx

It worked really well, but I want to take advantage of the TiM551's IP67 rating. This means I can't use the usb on the side. I'm new to writing drivers for devices and not particularly knowledgeable on networking. Is there a guide out there for me to follow? I've been studying up on the LMS1xx driver, but I don't know if its enough to help me write it.
I would imagine the first step is to use wireshark to understand how the message is formatted.
Learning how to write drivers would be really helpful, I wouldn't want to be limited from just whats currently available.
Thank you!

A:

The author of the driver informed me TCP is already supported with the current driver. It was just updated on the documentation and works wonderfully!
