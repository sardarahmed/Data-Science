Q:

planning_environment in electric for clearing known objects

planning_environment has been changed in electric as compared to diamondback. Can anyone please point out what is corresponding to these lines in electric (node for clearing known objects?).
Thanks!
<!--clearing known objects from the laser data-->
<node pkg="planning_environment" type="clear_known_objects" name="laser_clear_objects" output="screen">
    <remap from="cloud_in" to="tilt_scan_cloud" />
    <remap from="cloud_out" to="tilt_scan_cloud_known" />
    <param name="sensor_frame" type="string" value="base_scan_link" />              

    <param name="fixed_frame" type="string" value="base_link" />
    <param name="object_padd" type="double" value="0.02" />
    <param name="object_scale" type="double" value="1.0" />

A:

A good introduction to the new arm navigation stacks in Electric is in a recent IROS tutorial (http://www.ros.org/wiki/arm_navigation/Tutorials/IROS2011). Working through that tutorial may answer a lot of your questions.
