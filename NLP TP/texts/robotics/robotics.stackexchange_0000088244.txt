Hi,
I am trying to install these modules on a fresh ubuntu 14.04 OS
"python-rosdep", 
"python-rosdistro", 
"python-rosdistro-modules", 
"python-catkin-pkg", 
"python-catkin-pkg-modules", 
"python-netifaces", 
"python-qt4", 
"python-qt4-dev", 
"python-pyside", 
"libapr1", 
"libaprutil1",

and I am getting the following error
'/usr/bin/apt-get -y -o \"Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef\" -o \"Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold\"    install 'python-rosdep' 'python-rosdistro' 'python-rosdistro-modules' 'python-catkin-pkg' 'python-catkin-pkg-modules' 'python-netifaces' 'python-qt4-dev' 'python-pyside' 'libapr1' 'libaprutil1' 'libzzip-0-13' -o APT::Install-Recommends=no' failed: dpkg-deb: error: archive '/var/cache/apt/archives/python-catkin-pkg-modules_0.4.7-1_all.deb' has premature member 'control.tar.xz' before 'control.tar.gz', giving up\ndpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/python-catkin-pkg-modules_0.4.7-1_all.deb (--unpack):\n subprocess dpkg-deb

Can you please update your question with the error again? Instead of using the " button though please use the 101010 because the " doesn't format terminal output (it's for quoting, not code/terminal output) and is very hard to read.

Also, how are you attempting to install these packages?

A:

You're running into ros-infrastructure/catkin_pkg#227 (duplicate with similar error message: ros-infrastructure/catkin_pkg#230).
From that issue: make sure to first update dpkg (sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dpkg), as the original version of Ubuntu Trusty does not support LZMA archives in debian pkgs.

Hi there,
Were you able to solve the issue of  " unmet dependencies "
Comment by sibu on 2018-12-31:
Can you please indicate the command here to install a specific module say "python-rosdistro" into ROS from a ubuntu terminal
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-12-31:
Could I ask you to please not post multiple answers that aren't actually answers? Please use comments or post a new question.
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-12-31:
As to your question: can you verify that you have an up-to-date dpkg? Because that is what is the issue that was resolved in this Q&A. Not the python-rosdistro version.
Comment by sibu on 2018-12-31:
Yes i have done the dpkg update
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-12-31:
Then this Q&A is most likely not the place to ask for more information.
Comment by sibu on 2018-12-31:
Then where is the place ??
Comment by gvdhoorn on 2018-12-31:
Search for previous Q&As about python-rosdistro and if nothing fits then post a new one.
