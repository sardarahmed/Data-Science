Q:

How to delete a model with an world plugin

Hi
I wrote a WorldPlugin similar to the factory example and now I want to delete a added model but how?
The following approach does not work :-(
void delete(const std::string& name){
    # Info world_ is of type physics::WorldPtr 
    physics::ModelPtr p = world_->GetModel(name);
    p->RemoveChildren();        
}

Greetings
Markus

Thanks Andrei, Fini worked

A:

Based on Andrei's comment I changed my code and now it works.
Thanks to Andrei :-)
void delete(const std::string& name){
    # Info world_ is of type physics::WorldPtr 
    physics::ModelPtr p = world_->GetModel(name);
    p->Fini();        
}
