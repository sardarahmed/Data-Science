Q:

solve with PlannerTerminationCondition missing from ROS OMPL

It appears that the method virtual bool solve (const base::PlannerTerminationCondition &ptc) is missing from ompl::geometric::SimpleSetup in the ROS package. Here is the OMPL reference, and here is the ROS reference without this method.
I am trying to run several planners in parallel, so I am modifying the call to solve in ompl_ros_planning_group (in ompl_ros_interface) to take a PlannerTerminationCondition object  as an argument so that all planners can be terminated as soon as one finishes planning.

Hello Robbie,
This has been corrected for ROS fuerte. I apologize for this oversight! If you would like to use this in electric, you can try to  port the new ompl library.
A package is provided here:
svn co https://rice-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rice-ros-pkg/ompl ompl
