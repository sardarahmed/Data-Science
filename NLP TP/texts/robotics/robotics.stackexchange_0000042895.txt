Q:

Creating an RVIZ plugin for a new display type

Hello,
So for my project I created my own message type and was hoping to have it displayed in RVIZ. It is a slight adaptation of GridCells, but instead of containing a list of Points, it contains a list of a Point message that I created. The custom Point message contains two more pieces of information.
My problem is that the User Guide for RVIZ has told me that there is no API documentation. Is this still true? Is there any way for me to write a plugin? I think using RVIZ to display custom types of messages would make it even more powerful of a tool. Thanks for the help,
Blair

A:

As far as I know the interface is still under development, so the API might not be stable, but there is a tutorial:

Depending on what you want to display, there is always the option to send everything as a marker array. That should work all the time, if applicable.
