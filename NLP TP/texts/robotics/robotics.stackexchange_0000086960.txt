Q:

Gazebo ROS package structure

I've just started to learn ROS using Lunar distribution on an Ubuntu 16.04.
I need to use Gazebo with ROS to do my academic exercises.
Reading the Tutorial: Using roslaunch to start Gazebo, world files and URDF models, on section, Creating your own Gazebo ROS Package, I've found this text:
"Everything concerning your robot's model and description is located, as per ROS standards, in a package named /MYROBOT_description ..."
I have tried to find those ROS standards but I don't know where they are.
Is there any standard to add a robot to a ROS package? Where can I find more information about it?

A:

This is not a standard for package layout, but for naming.
If there is a standard, it would be REP-144 - ROS Package Naming. Under section [Naming Rules](REP-144 - ROS Package Naming, it says:

Special Suffixes:

a package containing the URDF and meshes of a robot should be named <name_of_the_robot>_description, e.g pr2_description

So this basically says: packages with robot models should be called X_description.
That is most likely what the tutorial you linked refers to.

Edit:

Thanks. I'm lost with this. It's hard to start learning ROS.

Note btw: I just referred to the REP as it's a convenient document. The custom / convention of naming pkgs with robot models in them description packages has existed since long before REP-144 was written.

I have followed the tutorial, but when I run: me@myComputer:~/catkin_ws$ roslaunch MYROBOT_gazebo MYROBOT.launch. I get: RLException: [MYROBOT.launch] is neither a launch file in package [MYROBOT_gazebo] nor is [MYROBOT_gazebo] a launch file name. Any idea?

No idea. But just a comment: you're not required to use MYROBOT everywhere. It's just a placeholder for whatever name you'd actually want/need. It's similar to the X I used everywhere in my answer.
