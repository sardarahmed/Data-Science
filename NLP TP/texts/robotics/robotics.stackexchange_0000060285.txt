Q:

Rviz on Odroid - undefined references to Ogre namespace

Hi,
I have a Odroid-X2, which is a ARM platform, and I'm trying to install rviz on it (yes I know it can be a heavy task to a ARM board but it serves as testing for now). I have Linaro 12.11 installed with ROS Hydro. When trying to catkin_make my ws I get only the following errors, related to Ogre:

This code block was moved to the following github gist:
https://gist.github.com/answers-se-migration-openrobotics/76a1dad3d5c06b63435441bb343c731b

I have ogre installed by debian packages, namely libogre-1.7.4, libogre-1.7.4-dbg, libogre-dev, libogre-perl and ogre-utils. Is there something missing here? Any tips?
Thanks in advance! Best regards

A:

Never mind! It was solved after a clean install ;)
Then, just have to apply what's in this topic: http://answers.ros.org/question/52098/unable-to-compile-rviz-on-ubuntu-armhf/
