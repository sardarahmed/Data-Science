Q:

Gazebo models available

Dear Gazebo community,
I am looking for the gazebo models (with plugin) available, and I am not sure if there's another source than the gazebo's models folder.
Once I started a model and sent it to be included in the model library but I can't find it anywhere, does this library exist?
Thanks in advance!

A:

https://gazebosim.org/models is the location where models can be download from. This is usually accomplished via the Gazebo GUI.
https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models is the mercurial repository of the models. New models may be submitted via a pull-request.
