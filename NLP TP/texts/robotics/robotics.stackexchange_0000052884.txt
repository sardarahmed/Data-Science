Q:

rosjava operating system

Hi all,
is rosjava for android only ?
Or can I use rosjava platform independant with any JavaVM ?
e.g. RaspberryPi / OSX / Linux / QNX
Background: I'd like to run nodes for IO-Sensors at small embeded systems.
Idee: something like ROSC with very small footprint and overhead
Thanks for any hints
Cheers
Chrimo

You should be able to use rosjava on any system with a Java VM.
