Q:

RoboEarth - Distance of Detected Object

Hey,
I am trying to use RoboEarth to detect some objects. Once I've detected the object I wanted to know the distance to this object but am unsure how to obtain this information. Does anyone know how I can do this? The tutorial page for detecting objects says: "Also, a new tf transformation is published that specifies the objects estimated position." so I am assuming it is possible to get the distance?
Running rostopic list at runtime will give:
/camera/depth/camera_info
/camera/depth/disparity

/camera/depth/image_raw
/camera/depth/image_rect

Any help is much appreciated.
Thank You

A:

The detected pose of the object is published as a tf transformation named "OBJECTCLASS.OBJECTNAME", as written on this page.

Thanks ddimarco. In the end I just wrote a subscriber which subscribed to the re_kinect/detection_results topic and filtered out only the points3d data..Then by getting the max and min values of each x,y,z I could get the box around the object. Thank you for the help!!
