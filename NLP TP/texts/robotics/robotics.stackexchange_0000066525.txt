Q:

Get only the current map from GMapping

Hi,
I'm new in ROS and I want to do a DATMO application with laser scan.
For the first step of this application, I only need to get the current map created by GMapping. Is that possible?
Could you please tell me what should I do in details? or show me some references?
Thank you.

Dear Sadek,
gmapping is designed to work with odometry and laser scan data and you cannot use it if one of them is missing. If I understand you need to transform laser data in an occupancy grid (that is the same topic type of map published by gmapping): in that case some kind of Costmap2D is what you need. You should set up static_map to false, so no external map is required and only laser data will be used, and rolling_window to true, so the robot will be every posed at centre of costmap. Costmap2D will publish /grid that should be exactly what you need.
Unfortunately (for you) the Costmap2D is not provided as node since it is embedded in move_base node so you should get the sources and write your own node. Furthermore it do something more than transform laser data to occupancy grid: it define costs used for path planning: maybe you can find a setup that works fine for your goal.

Thank you for your response. It's exactly what I need. However, is there any other package (more simpler) which converts laser data in an occupancy grid?

Not in my knowledge, sorry!

Thanks afranceson. I'll try  Costmap2D then.
