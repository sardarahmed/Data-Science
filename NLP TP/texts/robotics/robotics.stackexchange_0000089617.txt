Q:

Maintain/keep all the PointCloud2 in Rviz

I am publishing PointCloud2 in Rviz, but when I publish the current PointCloud2 msg from the topic, the last msg will disappear, how can I maintain all the PointCloud2 in Rviz?

A:

The PointCloud2 display has a "decay time" setting that defaults to 0 (i.e. only last cloud is shown). If you crank that up, all clouds that are not older than the number you select [in seconds] are shown in rviz. Depending on the type of data this might lead to very high CPU and memory consumption, so you'll have to try and see what works for you.

hey Stefan, I just found the decay time as well. That's what exactly I need. Thanks a lot.
