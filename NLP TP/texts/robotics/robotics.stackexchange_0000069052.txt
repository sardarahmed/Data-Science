Q:

Xtion_pro_live Skeleton_tracker cannot work

Hello everyone,
    I can use xtion pro live by openni2 . `roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch`
 I want to use xtion pro live to detect human skeleton . But I cannot use `NiTE v2` as I cannot download it from [here](http://openni.ru/files/nite/index.html). 
 openni2_tracker is cannot use too. 
 And other tutorials like [skeleton_tracker](https://github.com/Chaos84/skeleton_tracker) is also unwork.
 I mean we cannot use skeleton now without NiTE v2 ???
 Or are there any package taht I can use or other way that could solve my problem ? 
 Thanks first!

Hi @wsAndy !
You can download nite2 from here. If you have issues, follow these guidelines. Then you can make this skeleton_tracker work.
Please, let me know if you have issues.

Chaos , thanks for your answer ! The website you advice me is really good but the problem is that I could not download NiTE2 from this website. I don't know the reason.

Chaos, for how long have you ran your skeleton tracker while publishing depth and rgb at the same time? Do you see your program crashing after running for a while? What's the longest you've voluntarily ran your program for?

@Pototo, the last time I used this node was just a couple of weeks ago, and it ran for hours.
