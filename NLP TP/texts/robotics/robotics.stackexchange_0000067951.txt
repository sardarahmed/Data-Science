Q:

hector quadrotor controller

I'm looking to eventually modify the controller used for the hector quadrotor.
I'm a bit confused, when I look on github (https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor/tree/indigo-devel/hector_quadrotor_controller) the hector_quadrotor_controller directory has a src folder with multiple .cpp files inside, but when I search my install for the hector_quadrotor_controller folder, neither of the two results have it.
I don't understand why it's not present? (I have followed the install instructions for the hector tutorials).

Install it as source

A:

credit goes to eng/Esraa Magdy
what I will write is for installing hector on ros kinetic
as a piece of advice : remove your installation by deleting it from your catkin_ws/src and then delete the whole file of build and devel inside catkin workspace
here we begin
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-control
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-unique-identifier
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-geographic-info
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-laser-geometry
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-tf-conversions
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-tf2-geometry-msgs
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joy
mkdir hector_pkg
git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor
git clone -b catkin https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_localization
git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_gazebo
git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_models
git clone -b catkin https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam
in the file hector_quadrotor/hector_quadrotor/hector_quadrotor_gazebo/urdf/CMakeLists.txt
find the following line: 's/option(USE_PROPULSION_PLUGIN "Use a model of the quadrotor propulsion system" ON)
change ON to OFF
in hector_quadrotor/hector_quadrotor/hector_quadrotor_gazebo/urdf/CMakeLists.txt
find s/option(USE_AERODYNAMICS_PLUGIN "Use a model of the quadrotor aerodynamics" ON)
change ON to OFF
cd ..
catkin make
source devel/setup.bash
to test if everything is okay
roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo indoor_slam_gazebo.launch
in a new terminal enable the motors using the following :
rosservice call /enable_motors "enable: true"
