Q:

How to know which points pcl::PassThrough and pcl::StatisticalOutlierRemoval removes?

Hi,
I would like to know which point is removed/filtered out from an input cloud after applying pcl::PassThrough and pcl::StatisticalOutlierRemoval filters. What I mean by "which point" is the x and y index values of a 3D Point in the sensor plane, or simply the index value of the point.
I have checked pcl::ExtractIndices and pcl_base.h and many other source files, but I couldn't find an easy way to do that.
Thanks...

You can get x,y,z of points that you want when you call pcl::PassThrough and pcl::StatisticalOutlierRemoval filters. What I don't know is how to know the indices of original point cloud. Anyone know? Thank you~

Hi Corey,
I think you misunderstood the actual problem here.
It is not possible to know which points are removed/filtered out in the current version of PCL for the filters that I have mentioned above. This feature/addon is going to be included in the upcoming versions of PCL, probably 2.0.
