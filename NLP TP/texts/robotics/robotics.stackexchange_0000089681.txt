One is a message used to store and transmit data so is compatible with message passing subsystem, serialisation, etc. The other is designed for processing information within ROS so includes methods to perform geometric operations.

I know that it's current architecture design of the whole ROS. But you don't think, should it be made uniform (exists one of them)?

A:

The reason for this separation is that it's actually recommended to keep your business logic separated from the ROS integration. If we start importing ROS domain concepts and data structures into all sorts of code, that code will be "glued" to ROS 1 (or 2). That is undesirable.
