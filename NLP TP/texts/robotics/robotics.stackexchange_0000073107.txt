Q:

How to use  to change values from dwa_local_planner_params.yaml?

I'm using a launch file that includes turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch and I want to set the values of certain move_base parameters.  gmapping_demo.launch traces to move_base.launch.xml which traces to turtlebot_navigation/dwa_local_planner_params.yaml.
If I can "rosparam get" the parameter that I want to change, how can I set that parameter inside of my launch file that I created?
Thanks!

A:

Figured it out.  Since these parameters are global parameters, you can just use "rosparam list" to find the parameter you want to change, (in my case it was /move_base/DWAPlannerROS/max_vel_x), and then add:
<param name="/move_base/DWAPlannerROS/max_vel_x"  value="0.1"/>

to your launch file.
