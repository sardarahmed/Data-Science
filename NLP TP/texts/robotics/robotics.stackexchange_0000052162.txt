Q:

Does anybody make and sell stickers with the ROS logo and related products/brands/companies?

Where can I get stickers for ROS, related products, and the companies that produce them?
I suddenly have a great desire to put stickers on my laptop after living in Silicon Valley for sometime now. I also want to stick them on my robots and STOP signs. Does anybody make and sell stickers with the ROS logo and related products/brands/companies? I would love to have stickers for the things like OpenCV, Turtlebot, OSRF, Gazebo, Willow Garage, Yujin, Kobuki, OpenNI, Clearpath, etc.
