Q:

Ros2 install / Unable to locate package

Hi together,
I have some trouble installing ROS2 on Lubuntu 18.04 on a Asus Think Board.
I tried the installation manual at https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Crystal/Linux-Install-Debians/ for crystal and also for dashing. Both of them don't work for me and I get

E: Unable to locate package ros-crystal-ros-base

Here is my Terminal in-&output:

This confuses me slightly:

Get:1 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports bionic/main armhf libcurl4 armhf 7.58.0-2ubuntu3 [183 kB]

but then:

Get:3 http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages [344 kB]

Get:4 http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu bionic/main arm64 Packages [331 kB]

Assuming you're actually running an armhf platform:
If I interpret REP-2000: ROS 2 Target Platforms - Platforms by Distribution - Crystal Clemmys (December 2018 - December 2019) correctly, it would appear there are no binary packages for the armhf architecture (neither on Ubuntu nor Debian).
Only arm64 is supported by the buildfarm.
It appears Dashing has support for arm32 (here).

You are correct. It's armhf architecture.
Unfortunately there are no Dashing arm32 packages and building also don't work for me(in the manual is no apt repository for arm32), not like described in the REP-2000.
Building crystal works for me on 16.04 (without rviz).
So does anyone knows when arm32 repositories are added or where I can get the package or sources?

You're probably running into ros2/ros2#721.
Perhaps @nuclearsandwich can say something about the ETA of armhf pkgs for Bionic.
