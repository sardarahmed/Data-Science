Hi All,

A:

Maps live in and are accessed through the map_store node, which is backed by a mongodb instance. The map_store node has some service calls you can make to extract maps, but they aren't documented.
Once you've made a map and loaded it with one of the android applications, you should be able to use the map_saver node in map_server to save your map to a file; take a look at the documentation for map_saver

I found out that my problem is with mongodb instance. I have an error from rxconsole: " exited with exit code 100". what can be the cause? how can I fix this error?
