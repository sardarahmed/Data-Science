Q:

Docker ROS GUI tutorial

I have  been following the tutorial found here: http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI
I can get the insecure method working using xhost +local:root however, I am concerned about security, so would like to use the second method where you pass your /etc/passwd and such to the container. This, however, doesn't work for me, copying the example exactly. Has Docker changed since this was written to not allow this? Note: Due to volume mount time, the $USER field didn't work as it didn't find my user name, so I used my user id instead.
Docker version 19.03.4-ce, build 9013bf583a

A:

The tutorials where written quite a while ago, and in that time a number of projects have cropped up to simplify the task of using GUIs within docker. Rather than hacking on the Xserver and docker runtime arguments yourself, I'd recommend using a particular tool developed for this by OSRF called rocker:
