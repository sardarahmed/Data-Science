A:

AFAIK, you can use three different types of mesh here:

.dae  (Collada)
.mesh (Ogre)
.stl

I just used FreeCAD to convert the STEP file into a STL file, and it worked great.
The meshes you specify in the URDF are used in a number of places, such as visualization in RViz, and collision avoidance.
It would be great to have some documentation about the "officially supported" mesh types in the wiki. At the moment, this information is scattered across a number of pages:

RViz Mesh Resource Marker
URDF XML reference
URDF tutorial

Perhaps somebody with more insight into this can have a look?
