Q:

Would is be possible to connect a HiTechnic prototype board to an Arduino?

Does anyone know if this is possible? It's just an i2c device right? I mean you would have to cut the cable and make it so you could plug into the pins on the Arduino but you should just be able to use the wire library and say something like. 
Wire.beginTransmission(0x10);

the NXT hardware developers kit tells you what pins are which http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/support/files/default.aspx 
Thanks
EDIT. Turns out this is very possible. The main problem was that HiTechnic says the address is 0x10 and it is actually 0x08 but here is a short sketch that reads and prints some into about the device, i.e. the manufacturer and version. 
#include <Wire.h>

#define ADDRESS 0x08

void setup()
{
  Wire.begin();
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
  readCharData(0, 7);
  Serial.println();    
  readCharData(8, 8);
  Serial.println();
  readCharData(16, 8);
  Serial.println();

  Serial.println("-----------------------------");

  delay(1000);
}

void readCharData(int startAddress, int bytesToRead)
{
  Wire.beginTransmission(ADDRESS);
  Wire.write(startAddress);
  Wire.endTransmission();

  Wire.requestFrom(ADDRESS, bytesToRead);

  while(Wire.available()) 
  {
     char c = Wire.read();
     Serial.print(c);  
  }
}

Per the schematics of the UltraSonic Sensor the P1.3/SCL is DIGIAI0 or J1.5 and P3.0/SDA is DIGIAI1 or J1.6. And the developer Kit Manual states it is I2C as per philips original standard, detailing all the memory address's of the ESC015 chip and with all the recommended interfacing circuitry. The only note that I see is that they state the I2C's SCL is 9600. Kind of slow. But all very do-able for an Arduino. check out http://www.openelectrons.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=7 as they have a shield to directly connect and libraries for the Arduino.
