Q:

Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (Java)

I'm going through the three rosjava tutorials at http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava.
I successfully reached the end of Creating Rosjava Packages, and I am now attempting to fill in apparent gaps between that tutorial and the third, Unofficial Messages.
Specifically, I am hoping to find a Java version of Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (C++) and Writing a Simple Service and Client (C++), along with information about running the resultant Java-based nodes, as in the associated "Examining" tutorials that follow those above.
Could someone point me in the right direction or verify that such information is not yet available?

What was the blocker here at this last step?

FYI, the above comment was only relevant to an intermediate version of this question. See my answer below for a link to the directions I was seeking.

A:

After discussing this question with Daniel Stonier over email, I received directions that got me to (1) having a compiled publisher and a compiled subscriber and (2) running them as ROS nodes.
I added a tutorial page that documents the additional steps needed. The page is Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (Java) and is now in the tutorial sequence at http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava.
