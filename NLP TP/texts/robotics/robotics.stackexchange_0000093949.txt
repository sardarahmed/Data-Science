Q:

How to updating certain ROS2 package

Dear all:
Currently Ros2 have released the new version which is called Eloquent Elusor.
I found that some packages have updated likes RVIZ and I want to use it at old version which is Dashing.
How should I only update some certain package such as only update RVIZ?
Thank you

A:

If you want to use Dashing all you need to do is following the Dashing specific instructions: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/

How should I only update some certain package such as only update RVIZ?

If you are asking how to use a newer version of rviz (e.g. the Eloquent one) with Dashing then the answer is: don't.
There is no guarantee that this will work. Often new ROS distributions come with changes / additions and if rviz in Eloquent has been updated for them it won't work with Dashing anymore.
