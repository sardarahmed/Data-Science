Q:

ROS Cmake Error in lsb.cmake:8 (string): string no output variable specified

When I am trying to compile a workspace using catkin_make I get a CMake error. I think that this has to do with the python installation. The catkin_make has compiled in the the past and I have not changed /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/platform/lsb.cmake. I am using ubuntu 14.04 and a ROS version of indigo. Does anyone else know where this problem is coming from?
The error occurs when I run:
~$ cd catkin_ws_working_copy
~/catkin_ws_working_copy$ catkin_make

I get this error:
 ####
    #### Running command: "make cmake_check_build_system" in "catkin_ws_working_copy/build"
    ####

    CMake Error at /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/platform/lsb.cmake:21 (string):   string no output variable specified Call Stack (most recent call first):   /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/all.cmake:147 (include)   /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:20 (include)   CMakeLists.txt:52 (find_package)

I have not changed the lsb.cmake file and it is below:
find_program(LSB_RELEASE_EXECUTABLE lsb_release)

if(LSB_RELEASE_EXECUTABLE)
  set(LSB_FOUND TRUE CACHE BOOL "lsb_release executable was found")
  execute_process(COMMAND ${LSB_RELEASE_EXECUTABLE} -si
    OUTPUT_VARIABLE LSB_DISTRIB_ID
    OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
  string(TOUPPER ${LSB_DISTRIB_ID} v)
  set(${v} TRUE CACHE BOOL "LSB Distrib tag")

  execute_process(COMMAND ${LSB_RELEASE_EXECUTABLE} -sd
    OUTPUT_VARIABLE LSB_DESCRIPTION
    OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
  execute_process(COMMAND ${LSB_RELEASE_EXECUTABLE} -sr
    OUTPUT_VARIABLE LSB_RELEASE
    OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
  execute_process(COMMAND ${LSB_RELEASE_EXECUTABLE} -sc
    OUTPUT_VARIABLE LSB_CODENAME
    OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)

  string(TOUPPER ${LSB_DISTRIB_ID} v)
  set(${v} TRUE CACHE BOOL "LSB Distribution")
  #message(STATUS "${v} is on")

  string(TOUPPER ${LSB_DISTRIB_ID}_${LSB_CODENAME} v)
  set(${v} TRUE CACHE BOOL "LSB Distrib - codename tag")
  #message(STATUS "${v} is on")
endif()

This appears to be a cross-post of ROS Cmake Error in lsb.cmake:8 (string): string no output variable specified.
Could you please not do that? It leads to split discussions at best and duplicated (ie: wasted) effort in any case.

What is the output of lsb_release -si?
Comment by AyaO on 2019-07-23:
I have the same problem as jonbbbb ? Did you find any solution ?

I never found a solution. I moved my work space to a different computer, and my programs worked fine. So I have just been working on a different linux machine.

A:

I've run into this issue a few times as well.  It generally occurs after I install a new version of python on my machine.  I don't fully understand the source of the problem, but re-installing lsb-release generally works:
sudo apt install --reinstall lsb-release
