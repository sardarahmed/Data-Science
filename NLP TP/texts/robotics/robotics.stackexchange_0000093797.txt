Q:

despite sourcing workspace, 'roscore' command not found

I used to open terminal and be able to do ros commands such as roscore, rostopic, rosrun, roslaunch and catkin_make.
But now, something become broken, and I need to do source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash everytime when I open terminal. I dont know why.
I have checked .bashrc file. source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash  and source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash is there.
Can you help me?

Can you open a terminal and execute the command env | grep ROS and show us the ouput ?

The environment variables look fine to me, but you can't run roscore ?

Indeed that's strange that your autocompletion have roscd, rosdep etc but not roscore. Have ou reinstalled ros recently ?
Moreover what is the ouput of which roscore when you open a new terminal ? Same question after you run source opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash ?
Comment by june2473 on 2019-11-12:
when I open new terminal which roscore gives nothing
then I do source opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash and which roscore gives me:
/opt/ros/kinetic/bin/roscore

and roscore gives me:
