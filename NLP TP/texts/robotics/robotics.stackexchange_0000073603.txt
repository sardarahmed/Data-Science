Q:

Local and global costmap issues

Hi,
I got an issue with the configuration of the local and global costmaps.
I end up with this situation:

For RVIZ, there is no trouble with my costmaps.
Here are my config files:
local_costmap:
local_costmap:
  update_frequency: 3.0
  publish_frequency: 3.0
  static_map: false
  rolling_window: true
  width: 15
  height: 15
  resolution: 0.05
  origin_x: 0.0
  origin_y: 0.0

global_costmap:
global_costmap: 
  update_frequency: 2.0
  publish_frequency: 2.0
  static_map: false
  rolling_window: true
  width: 40.0
  height: 40.0
  resolution: 0.05

Common_costmap:
footprint: [[-0.792, -0.344], [0.408, -0.344], [0.408, 0.344], [-0.792,0.344]]

observation_sources: scan scan2
scan: {sensor_frame: /laser, data_type: LaserScan, topic: /scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
scan2: {sensor_frame: /laser2, data_type: LaserScan, topic: /scan2, marking: true, clearing: true}

I end in this situation because I notice my global plan didn't take in count the global costmap based on the map.

It's the same situation that this one
I use 2 laserscans : one higher than the others.
I have correct the situation, I will post my config files.

A:

Auto-answer time :) ... or at least better configs files without troubles :)
costmap_common:
footprint: [[-0.792, -0.344], [0.408, -0.344], [0.408, 0.344], [-0.792,0.344]]

observation_sources: scan scan2
scan: {sensor_frame: /laser, data_type: LaserScan, topic: /scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
scan2: {sensor_frame: /laser2, data_type: LaserScan, topic: /scan2, marking: true, clearing: false}

inflation_radius: 0.344

global costmap:
#Independent settings for the planner's costmap
global_costmap: 
  update_frequency: 2.0
  publish_frequency: 2.0
  static_map: true
  rolling_window: map
  width: 40.0
  height: 40.0
  resolution: 0.05

local costmap:
local_costmap:
  update_frequency: 3.0
  publish_frequency: 3.0
  static_map: false
  rolling_window: true
  width: 5
  height: 5
  resolution: 0.1
  origin_x: 0.0
  origin_y: 0.0

Now the nav plan don't plan to go through map walls.
