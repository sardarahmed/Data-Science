Q:

Scale tool in Gazebo not working

I am getting started with Gazebo and I am following the "Vehicle construction" tutorial from here:http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b3
I just added a cube shape into the model editor and am having trouble to scaling it graphically with the axis arrows. I can change the visual and collision geometries from the link inspector and it updated the model.
I see this message in the in the terminal that I launched Gazebo from: (not sure if it has anything to do with the scaling)

Node::Advertise(): Error advertising a topic. Did you forget to start the discovery service?

I am running gazebo on Ubuntu 16.04 in a VM.

Sounds like the same issue as this question. There's also an issue on the repo.
