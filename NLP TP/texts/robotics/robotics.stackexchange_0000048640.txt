Q:

compiling rviz on debian

I'm trying to compile rviz on fuerte running debian/amd64 sid.
I downloaded the package from the wiki.
Using rosmake leads to the following error:
$ rosmake visualization

[ rosmake ] rosmake 

starting...                                                                                                                                                 
[ rosmake ] Packages requested are: 

['visualization']                                                                     

...                                

cannot find required resource: rviz

Where can I download it ?

A:

In Fuerte, rviz was part of the visualization stack, before version 1.9.x. Now, it is a separate package.
To get the correct version for Fuerte, check out the fuerte branch from git://github.com/ros-visualization/visualization.git.

Finally, I found an older version and successfully compiled it, with slight modifications in some source files.
