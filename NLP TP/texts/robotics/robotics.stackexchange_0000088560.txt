Q:

Installing navigation stack on ROS Melodic

Hi,
I've been trying to use some features from the ros-planning/navigation stack, but it seems that it is not currently available for ROS Melodic. In my case, I need to use the map_server feature, in one of my applications. So far I've read that (sic) It has been released, but a sync has not yet happened., but all the package is available on their github page. Is there a way to manually install the downloaded package from GitHub on ROS Melodic Distro? I've already tried sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-navigation and had no success.
Thanks in advance.

have you tried building github package?
Comment by woz on 2018-08-17:
Haven't found any instructions on how to do that. Would you mind explaining how to?

clone into your workspace and do catkin build

Didn't work. Copied the whole content into my catkin_ws folder, sourced it, tried to run catkin build and got catkin: command not found. Tried catkin_makeand nothing happened as well.

Also, downloaded the catkin_tools in order to use catkin build but when I tried to do it on my ws, I've got:  The build space at '/home/<user>/catkin_ws/build' was previously built by 'catkin_make'. Please remove the build space or pick a different build space.

catkin clean -y && catkin build
Comment by woz on 2018-08-17:
Didn't work as well: [clean] Error: The current or desired workspace could not be determined. Please run catkin cleanfrom within a catkin workspace or specify the workspace explicitly with the--workspace option.

That is not at all how you would build a pkg from sources.
See #q252478 for the general procedure.

A:

If the packages are really released, built and just waiting for a sync, you can install them from the staging repository.
See wiki/ShadowRepository for information on how to do that.
Don't build things from source if you don't have to.

Your last comment on my post, and this post did exactly what I wanted. Thanks a lot, @gvdhoorn! Worked like a charm :)

If you're using the shadow-fixed repository then I'm not sure why you'd still need to build from source.
Comment by woz on 2018-08-17:
I wasn't using it. To be honest, I had no idea about its existence. Anyway, both your posts helped me a lot and for that I'm really grateful :)
