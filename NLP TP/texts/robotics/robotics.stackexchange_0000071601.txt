Q:

Package "ompl" does not follow the version conventions

When I ran
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

there have
WARNING: Package "ompl" does not follow the version conventions. It should not contain leading zeros (unless the number is 0).

And then I found RViz can't add RobotModel.
SOS!
Thanks All!

A:

This question is actually two questions in one as the issue with the RobotModel in RViz is not related at all with the OMPL warning. Please open a different question for this issue.
In any case, it is safe to ignore the OMPL warning. Current OMPL version ROS release is 1.0.0 so if you update your packages this warning should disappear. Before, it was 0.15 or something like that, thus the warning appeared, but it is of no importance.

Actually, with OMPL 1.0.0 the warning is still there. I guess the reason is that the version is 1.0.0003094, therefore is still containing leading zeros in the patch number.
