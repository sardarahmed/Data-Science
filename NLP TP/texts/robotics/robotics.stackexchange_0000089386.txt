Q:

Retrieve joint locations and angles of robotic arms

I am new to ROS. I wanted to ask whether with using MoveIt or any other package with a robotic arm you are able to retrieve the joint positions and angles from whatever configuration the robotic arm is in.
I plan to use ROS with a robotic arm for reinforcement learning so when an action is taken I want to know what the joint locations and angles are to begin with and what the joint locations and angles are after the action is taken.
Note: I do not want to specify what location of the joints I want the arm to move to - rather, I want to know what the location of the joints is when I apply some random action.
Thanks!

A:

In typical setups the joint states of a robot are published on a joint_states topic with messages of type sensor_msgs/JointState.
Those would allow you to be notified of the current pose (in joint space) of a robot, simulated or not.
