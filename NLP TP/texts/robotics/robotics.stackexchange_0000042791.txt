Q:

How can I track distance traveled and Velocity of the robot?

I want to use the distance traveled and the avg velocity for a fitness evaluation for my robot. I can't find that information anywhere, though. Does anybody know of a package that publishes this information? I was hoping it was going to be part of move_base

What kinda robot are we talking about here?

The Turtlebot.

A:

That information is both in the transforms and odometry (http://ros.org/doc/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html)

Yeah, that's what I thought. I was really hoping for something where I wouldn't have to keep track of position and twist, but if I must, I must. Linear twist is going to correspond to velocity, right?

The current forward velocity is twist.twist.linear.x.To get distance you can integrate that over time, or sum the Euclidean distance from each previous position.
