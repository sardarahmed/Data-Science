Q:

installing stack ccny_vision

hi all,
i can't install the stack ccny_vision. i'm following the instruction, but i have some errors when i run

rosmake ccny_vision --rosdep-install.

i solved the first one with:

Run the following commands to remove
the offending line:
roscd ccny_vision sed -i '/ubuntu:
libglut3-dev/d' rosdep.yamllibglut3-dev/d' rosdep.yaml
libglut3-dev/d' rosdep.yaml

but when i build the ccny_vision stack:
rosmake/rosmake_output-20111206-162013
rosmake/rosmake_output-20111206-162013> mkdir -p build   mkdir: impossibile

What is the solution to this problem, I am having the same error..

A:

You are trying to create a directory in the /opt/ros/electric/ros/core path.
You will not have permission to create something in that place. If you still want to do it. You can change the permission of the ccny_vision folder with write access.
I suggest you to have a ros_workspace created as given in the below page
http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment
and use the same path for the future packages that you download and install.
In this particular case, just have this workspace created and setup the environment. Paste your ccny_vision folder there and try to execute your commands.
Hope this helps,
Karthik
