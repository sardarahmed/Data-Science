Q:

Installation of RosAria in ROS kinect

I followed the tutorial of RoaAria How to start ROSARIA . First, I brought RosAria into the workspace. Then I installed the ARIA from Adept MobileRobots. When I tried to build rosaria using catkin_make, I encountered the following error.
CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/LaserPublisher.cpp.o: In function `LaserPublisher::publishPointCloud()':
LaserPublisher.cpp:(.text+0x112b): undefined reference to `ArRangeBuffer::getBuffer[abi:cxx11]()'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
rosaria/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/build.make:156: recipe for target '/home/tezhang/catkin_ws/devel/lib/rosaria/RosAria' failed
make[2]: *** [/home/tezhang/catkin_ws/devel/lib/rosaria/RosAria] Error 1
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:3376: recipe for target 'rosaria/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [rosaria/CMakeFiles/RosAria.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:138: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
Invoking "make -j8 -l8" failed

Is it because of the new version ROS kinect or my wrong steps installing rosaria? Is there any way I can fix this problem? Thank you very much.

Note that libaria packages for newer Ubuntu versions (e.g. 16.04) will be released sometime in the future, check back at http://robots.mobilerobots.com/wiki/Aria to see if they become available (will also be announced on aria-users list and news section of that site.)
