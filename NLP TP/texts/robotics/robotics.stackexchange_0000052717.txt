Q:

How does gmapping uses odometry data (from the encoder + IMU)

Hi everyone, I'm currently working on a robotics project which uses gmapping. If I'm not wrong, the gmapping uses information from odometry and laser to obtain more accurate results. But how does the IMU and encoder data is used in this case? Any help is appreciated :)

A:

The IMU + encoder are usually fused into a combined improved odometry estimate (e.g. by the robot_pose_ekf node) that is in turn put into gmapping (instead of raw odometry).
