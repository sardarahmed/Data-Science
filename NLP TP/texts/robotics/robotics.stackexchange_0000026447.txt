Q:

Cloudsim/Softlayer: gzclient fails to launch on OCU

After running on the local OCU:
. ros.bash
I have shell variables (printenv | grep GAZ)
GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=http://10.0.0.51:11345
GAZEBO_IP=11.8.0.2
The gzclient launch fails, on a machine that can happily run gazebo locally.

Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt. You must
reimplement QApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

A:

Looks like you didn't source the usual /usr/share/drcsim/setup.sh on the OCU, which resulted in bad/unset Gazebo/OGRE paths.  I've added that to the User Guide and opened a ticket to add that line to the generated router/ros.bash.
