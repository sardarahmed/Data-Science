Q:

rviz crashes on indigo /osx due to serializer implementation

Ogre apparently cannot find a serializer implementation. Are the other platforms using a newer Ogre?
Would it help to rebuild Ogre?
  rosrun rviz rviz

I can confirm this issue. Ogre needs to be at least versio 1.8, but there are still problems with installing recent versions of ogre on OS X, see: https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/782
Comment by demmeln on 2014-07-15:
@William, can hydro rviz be built with ogre1.9? If so, we should find a fix for the 1.9 installation of ogre and then update the homebrew formula to version 1.9.
Comment by William on 2014-07-15:
Yes it can, you just get a warning about the mesh types being out of date, which is where this change came in for Indigo and using Ogre 1.9 meshes.

@William is there a fix for this? Thanks!

A:

rviz 1.11.3 is for Indigo, Indigo requires ogre 1.8 or 1.9. You have ogre 1.7 installed and it cannot process the mesh files.
An alternative is to get the 1.7 version of the mesh files for rviz by reverting this commit:

I solve this problem by git revert commit_id and then copy the model file .
