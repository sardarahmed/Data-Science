Q:

apt update fails/ cannot install pkgs even after updating keys

While trying to run: apt update I encountered the same problem described in https://answers.ros.org/question/325039/apt-update-fails-cannot-install-pkgs-key-not-working/
After following what @gvdhoorn suggested and trying to run apt update again, I get the following error:
Get:31 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages [3.150 kB]
Err:31 http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages
Writing more data than expected (3154295 > 3149706) [IP: 64.50.236.52 80]

I tried this on two different PCs with Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic installed. Is this something related to the repository having troubles or something wrong on my machine ? Does anyone else have the same problem?

A:

What solved the issue was to run sudo apt-get clean before running sudo apt-get update
