A:

1.) it has one rt process (look HERE), an Orocos controller for the PR2 is on our TODO list.
2.) see link above
3.) it is as real-time as your kernel allows it, if you have a real-time kernel it is hard real-time if you use pre-empt kernel or xenomai.

A general linux scheduler can't provide you any guaranties, however sometimes it does satisfy for mobile robotic manipulators. ROS also is not optimal for real-time.

So if I want to use rt process,should I install ROS on linux-rt kernel?
