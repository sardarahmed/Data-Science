Q:

Getting laser scan intensity values from RVIZ

I'm trying to get intensity values being returned via the sensor_msgs/LaserScan message. I am using RViz to visualize this data and I found that the display RGB value is being computed off the intensities being returned from this link:
http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/LaserScan
I am trying to get the intensities returned in a specific part of the laser scan. I was wondering if there was a way to get that from the RViz visualization (where I already see the RGB points)

A:

I was able to get the information I needed using the select tool from RVIZ. I was able to publish this information using the selected_points_publisher found here: https://github.com/tu-rbo/turbo-ros-pkg/tree/master/selected_points_publisher
