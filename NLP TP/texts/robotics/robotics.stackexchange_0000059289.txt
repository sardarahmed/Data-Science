Q:

How to solve "Couldn't find an AF_INET address for " problem

Hi, I am running four computers with only one the ROS master, and I am sure I set the correct ROS_MASTER_URI (=http://192.168.10.101:11311) to the other three computers. Then the problems like this:
I run a node in the master computer, and also I publish some message to that node. In this master computer, I can use "rostopic echo" to see the published messages, but in  another computer, if I run "rostopic list", I see all the topics, but if I run "rostopic echo /xxxx" then I cannot see anything. Most importantly, I see the master computer threw out a message saying Couldn't find an AF_INET address for [msl]. It is probably some network problem, so please help.

A:

skyhawk is right, set the ROS_IP for each computer. So for each computer, find the IP address in a terminal with
hostname -I

It will be the first set of numbers, like 10.0.0.25. To set it,
export ROS_IP=10.0.0.25

Make sure you're exporting the right address on each one, it'll be different for each computer.

(as mentioned in posts below): In case this does not solve your problem edit /etc/hosts to contain the name for the rosnode. For example in there add
192.168.3.5   my_hostname
