Q:

Loading node with nodelet manager doesn't work

I work in simulation.
I have this node in the launch file:

&ltnode pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="turtlebot_follower"
      args="standalone turtlebot_follower/TurtlebotFollower">
      &ltremap from="depth/points" to="camera/depth/points"/>
</node>

The program works. "turtlebot_follower" node subscribes to /camera/depth/points. Then I want to load this node in nodelet_manager. Here is a new launch file:

&ltnode pkg="nodelet" type="nodelet" name="turtlebot_follower"
      args="load turtlebot_follower/TurtlebotFollower manager">
      &ltremap from="depth/points" to="camera/depth/points"/>
</node>

I launched manager:

 rosrun nodelet nodelet manager

Then I run launch file. The program doesn't work. There is no subscriber to /camera/depth/points topic.
How can I solve this problem?
UPDATE: using command rosrun nodelet nodelet manager  instead of rosrun nodelet nodelet manager __name:=nodelet_manager

A:

I used difference namespace. When I launched nodelet manager in the same namespace it worked.
