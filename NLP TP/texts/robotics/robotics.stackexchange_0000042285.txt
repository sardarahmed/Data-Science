Q:

Compairing player-stage and ros-stage for multiple robots?

Hi,
I am working on stage simulator in ROS with multiple robots. I have written a code to move robot in stage simulator. When I try to run that code on 2 or 3 robots in stage, every robot has some different speed. Robot that starts moving first have high speed.
In player-stage we run .cfg file using player. Separate ports are assigned in .cfg file in case of multiple robots. i.e.
driver
(
name "stage"
provides ["6665:position2d:0"
"6665:sonar:0"
"6665:blobfinder:0"
"6665:laser:0"]
model "bob1"
)

But I am confused that how multiple robots are separated in stage-simulator in ros?
Can I run each robot on separate port in ROS?
Thanks

You probably need to collect more information for anyone to answer a question like this.

@Arkapravo Thanks a lot. I was very much confused. Have you run navigation-stage tutorial? When we use move_base with multiple robots, robots have same speed.

A:

@abdullah I am not sure about fuerte, but electric and diamondback did not have such a support for multi-robot simulations. http://answers.ros.org/question/11192/swarm-robotics-facility-in-ros/
