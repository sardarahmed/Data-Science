Q:

use dynamic reconfigure with arrays

Hello,
I want to use dynamic reconfiguration to modify an array in a ROS node, but I didn't found any example of how to modify the .cfg file on the web.
I want this line: gen.add("int_param",    int_t,    0, "An Integer parameter", 50,  0, 100)
in something kind of: gen.add("int_array",    int_t[2],    0, "An Integer array", [50 20],  [0 0], [100 100])
Can someone help?
Thanks!

A:

According to this Tutorial, arrays are not allowed:

type - defines the type of value stored, and can be any of int_t, double_t, str_t, or bool_t

Maybe you can achieve what you want by using the group type.
