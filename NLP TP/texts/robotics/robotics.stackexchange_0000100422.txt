Q:

Filtering out ROS2 rclcpp and rcl debug logs

Hi I am using ROS2 Foxy. My node has several types logging statements (info, debug, error). When I set the logging level to info, i see my error and info statements, which is expected. when i set the logging level to debug, i see all my logging statements but i also see bunch of logging statements from RCL and RCLCPP which I don't want to see. Is there a way I an filter out these system logs and only see my custom logging statements?
Thank you

I have the exact same need already for a long time, and haven't really found any proper solution. The trick I'm using now is for example
ros2 run package node --ros-args --log-level DEBUG | grep -v '[rcl]'
which removes the rcl stuff from the terminal output, but it will still write all the stuff in the log file. I would like to have a solution, where even into the file is not written the rcl stuff, because my log files become very heavy to handle, and could be reduced by 80% of it size just by removing all the rcl stuff.

A:

You can set log level specifically for the underlying components of your node (rcl, rclcpp, dds).
ros2 run package node --ros-args --log-level DEBUG --log-level rcl:=INFO

This way your node will output on DEBUG level, but rcl will be muted.
