Q:

gazebo_client.hh not found

I was trying to follow this tutorial but when I tried to compile it shows

I tried to remove gazebo client related codes and include, and got it compiled, but the subscriber never calls the callback function to print.
I am using Gazebo 5. What is wrong here?

Just to zoom a little bit more on the problem, are the gazebo developer libraries installed on your computer?

libgazebo5-dev right? I did have it installed.

Actually i downloaded the same files and got the very same error, client.hh does not exist, since i did this tutorial a few months ago i compared the files and found that in the earlier version
<gazebo/gazebo_client.hh> is <gazebo/gazebo.hh>
gazebo::client::setup is gazebo::setupClient
gazebo::client::shutdown() is gazebo::shutdown()
So the question that should be asked is how to get the new developer libraries that include this new client.hh?

A:

I found the problem. The tutorial uses this file. It's probably outdated. And I looked into the source code and found the listener example for Gazebo 5. This is the right file. Got it compiled and printing world info now.
