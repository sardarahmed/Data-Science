Q:

Custom ROS Service Cannot be Imported

I have created a simple custom ROS service for ROS Noetic. My import line is:
from fishbot_ros.srv import chess_service, chess_serviceResponse

The file structure is like this:
.
└── parent
    ├── src
    │   └── chess_node.py
    └── srv
        └── chess_service.srv

The service is generated correctly and is viewable by rossrv show. I have cleaned devel and build subfolders and then executed catkin make.
My CMakeLists.txt has the following sections:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  rospy
  message_generation
  std_msgs
)

add_service_files(
  FILES
  chess_service.srv
)

My package.xml has the following:
  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
  <build_depend>rospy</build_depend>
  <build_export_depend>rospy</build_export_depend>
  <build_export_depend>std_msgs</build_export_depend>
  <exec_depend>rospy</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>std_msgs</exec_depend>
  <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
  <exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>

Please help me understand what I'm doing wrong. I did this for a different project a while ago, and I've done everything the same.

Welcome to Robotics Stack Exchange!
If my_ros_pkg and MyService.srv are the name of the ROS package and name of the service file, respectively, please use the following line to import the service:
from my_ros_pkg.srv import MyService, MyServiceRequest, MyServiceResponse
