Q:

Getting error while using cmake command?

I created rosbuild workspace (mywork) and a package (test) within it.
I was trying to build the package using cmake command
[rosbuild] Building package test
[rosbuild] Error from directory check: /opt/ros/groovy/share/ros/core/rosbuild/bin/check_same_directories.py  /home/admin-pc/mywork/test

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/ros/groovy/share/ros/core/rosbuild/bin/check_same_directories.py", line 46, in <module>
    raise Exception

With multiple hit and trial I found the solution that is to use command
source ~/mywork/setup.bash 
but I need to use this in every new terminal.
Please tell the solution.

A:

I think the only solution is to either add that line ("source ~/mywork/setup.bash") in your ~/.bashrc file, so that it gets executed for each new shell, or to manually source it in all terminals where you want to use your workspace.
