Q:

Has anyone integrated ROS with Unity 3d?

You know: www.unity3d.com, runs Mono. Prefer Windows, but understand that Mac might be closer to supportable.

What kind of integration are you talking about?
Comment by daveayyyy on 2014-01-28:
Using C# to talk to native, DLL, or websocket, for example. Want to be able to interact with the 3D model of my building to tell robot where to go, have robot tell me where it is and reflect that in the model.

I integrated untiy via DLL + socket conection to player/stage 3 years ago . Was quite a bit of work. Haven't heard any thing about ROS+Unity, would be awesome, though.

Is there anyone who has got his/her hands dirty on that (viz. ROS+Unity3D) ?

These guys have done quite a bit in making unity and ROS speak. But sadly, they say nothing about their code.

A:

rosbridge is a great way to make a websocket which can stream data via restful api. You can use rosbridge to get topics from ROS to unity. I've done this myself but one caveat is that PointCloud2 topics are bugged in indigo to the point that the streaming doesn't work for those types.
Here's a great example to get you started with streaming topics form a kinect: http://wiki.ros.org/ros3djs/Tutorials/Point%20Cloud%20Streaming%20from%20a%20Kinect
Also, do ingest the data via Unity3d you merely point it at the web service.
