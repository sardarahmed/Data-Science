Q:

Problem with tf tutorial

ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
rviz: Missing resource catkin
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/user/fuerte_workspace
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/lib
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share
turtle_tf: Missing resource catkin
ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
ROS path [1]=/home/user/fuerte_workspace
ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/fuerte/stacks
ROS path [3]=/opt/ros/fuerte/lib
ROS path [4]=/opt/ros/fuerte/share

I get this error when I tried to do [tf/Tutorial/Introduction to tf].
Anyone else know how to solve this? Much appreciated.

I guess it is unable to locate package turtle_tf and rviz. Most probably the environment setup is not working properly. Check whether you are able to locate package rviz and turtle_tf using roscd command.

What command is this the output from?
Comment by FuerteNewbie on 2013-09-29:
rosdep install turtle_tf rviz

A:

I think you're missing this line in your rosdep sources (/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/20-default.list)
gbpdistro https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml fuerte

"gbpdistro https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml fuerte"
I believe it's required for fuerte but not newer.
