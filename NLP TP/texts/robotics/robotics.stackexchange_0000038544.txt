Q:

Rviz 2D alternative?

Hey there,
I would like to use a 2D User Interface for ROS, does it exist? As far as I'm concerned, rviz is the only there is (because gazebo/stage are simulators).
Why do I want to use something else than rviz? Mainly, because even specifying the topic of the data (position, laser ranging, speed control), it doesn't recognize it. From the troubleshooting page from RVIZ I found out I have to include my data into a tf, something that sounds very complicated and (maybe) unnecessary.
Is there any way out? And if there's not, any tutorials on how to turn my data/topic into a tf?
Cheers,
Update: On a nutshell, what I'm doing is fairly simple: 3 different cases of sending data through topics in ROS (one topic). I have a task_talker and a task_listener (based on the tutorial codes, just modifying the type of messages sent). Task_talker publishes the parameter into the topic and task_listener subscribes to it. The different tasks are as follows (with its parameters):

Position sending using geometry_msgs/Pose2D
Laser ranging sending using sensor_msgs/LaserScan
Speed Control using geometry_msgs/Twist.

I would post the code as well, but it also includes a different OS from ROS that would only further confuse readers.

A:

Since rviz only shows messages of type PoseStamped, you should convert this Pose2D to PoseStamped or to Odometry (in case you need to show multiple poses)
We have a program to convert from Pose2D to Odometry iri_msg_to_odom pose2d_to_odom. The instructions to download our repository are here: Download IRI ROS stack (you can download only the iri-ros core and then checkout the iri_msg_to_odom package.
the other way is code it by yourself (it's not difficult):)

So by putting the pose information into PoseStamped from Pose2D (without filling the header or the quaternion of pose), will rviz be able to recognize the input?

I think you should fill these fields, at least frame_id and orientation (for example with .x = .y = .z = 0, .w = 1)
