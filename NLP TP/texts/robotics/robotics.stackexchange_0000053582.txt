Q:

Large data storage in ROS community

I have test data (.bag files) each of which is several MB large and don't fit to development repository. Someone suggests me to put those files on http://pr.willowgarage.com/data/ but I don't seem to find how and where I can. If I'm allowed to do so then how?
DevelopersGuide says https://code.ros.org/gf/project/data is the right place that sounds outdated.
Thanks!

A:

We are working to setup downloads.ros.org as a replacement for pr.willowgarage.com.  We will create a way to submit data to be hosted there.
