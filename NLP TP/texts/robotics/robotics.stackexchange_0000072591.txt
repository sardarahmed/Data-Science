Q:

Module fails dependency check in python script

When I attempt to install a module I just built into ROS, it fails to 'find' a required package  because of an error in the associated check_deps.py file. The dependency it is trying to find is package genmsg, which is in fact installed (I even reinstalled, just in case). The Python file genmsg_check_deps.py is producing a Python error very early, during start-up, at the line:
from genmsg import EXT_MSG, EXT_SRV, MsgContext
claiming that there is no module named genmsg.
But of course this Python file itself is in lib/genmsg
We are using ROS Jade

Did you include genmsg in your package.xml as a build_depend?

A:

Turns out to have been operator error. I was using sudo to do the install, which clears the environment variables setup by setup.bash.
