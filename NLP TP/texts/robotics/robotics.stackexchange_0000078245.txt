Q:

import tf2/StaticTransformPublisher in Python

I'm following this tutorial[1] and having trouble with importing.
[1] http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20static%20broadcaster%20(Python)
>>> import tf2_ros
>>> tf2_ros.StaticTransformPublisher()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'StaticTransformPublisher'

Using up-to-date Indigo with Trusty.
$ dpkg -s ros-indigo-tf2-ros | grep Version
Version: 0.5.13-0trusty-20161025-211630-0700

What is it you are trying to do?
static_transform_publisher is a command line tool which can be used like this:
static_transform_publisher x y z yaw pitch roll frame_id child_frame_id period_in_ms

I appreciate the link, but I hate that command line interface and am trying to rewrite it.

The real problem is that the debian has not been updated. https://github.com/ros/geometry2/issues/199
