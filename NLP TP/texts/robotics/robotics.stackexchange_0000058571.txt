Q:

ROS / RoboEarth Package WIRE - unable to get source. Fuerte

I am attempting to install the WIRE stack, as described on http://wiki.ros.org/wire  however, when I try to run

svn co https://robotics.wtb.tue.nl/svn/ros/release/wire

I just get the response

svn: access to 'https://robotics.wtb.tue.nl/svn/ros/release/wire' forbidden

Could anyone explain how to get access to this?
Thanks
