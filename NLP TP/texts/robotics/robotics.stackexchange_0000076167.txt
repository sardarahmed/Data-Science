Q:

How to install hokuyo_node/urg_node on kinetic?

Hi,
I bought a Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 lidar today, but I can't use it with ROS kinetic.
Untill now hokuyo_node wiki still doesn't have a kinetic release. The newest release is for jade.
So I tried to install hokuyo_node from source. Firstly I cloned hokuyo_node source from github to my local directory ~/catkin_ws/src. Then I did catkin_make. The result is as follow:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "driver_base" with
any of the following names:

driver_baseConfig.cmake
driver_base-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "driver_base" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"driver_base_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
"driver_base" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
has been installed.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

"driver_base" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it

It seems that I need the driver_base package. But kinetic doesn't have a driver_base. As driver_base had been deprecated.
Is there anyone uses hokuyo lidar on Kinetic? Any help would be appreciated, Thx. :)

EDIT
Thanks to @130s, I tried urg_node just now. urg_node also hasn't been released to Kinetic, So I tried to intall it from source.  I cloned urg_node source from github to my local directory ~/catkin_ws/src. Then I did catkin_make. The result is as follow:
CMake Warning at /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:76 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "urg_c" with any of

  "urg_c_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "urg_c"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

So I need the package urg_c, but urg_c also hasn't been released to Kinetic.
What should I do, go back to jade?(~_~)

I also had to clone and build laser_proc and urg_c packages
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/laser_proc.git
git clone https://github.com/ros-dirvers/urg_c.git
cd ..
catkin_make

@KevinNickels, there is a typo in the repo clone link, should be:
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_c.git

A:

You will need to install and compile driver_base from sources too
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/driver_common.git 

First compile driver_common and then you should be able to compile hokuyo_node
