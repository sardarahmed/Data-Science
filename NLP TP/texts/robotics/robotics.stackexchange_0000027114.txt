Q:

Simulating Aquatic Environments

I'm trying to create a simple beach environment for Gazebo. Is there a way for me to simulate shallow water? I just want to robot to drive down the "sand" and look like it's partially submerged in water.

A:

If you only want the robot to disappear, then you can create a blue box model that has a visual and no collision. There will be no physical interaction between the robot and the water this way.

When you say "blue visual" do you mean just a blue colored plane with no collision component?
