I want to use atlas.cc, so follow the tutorial, but the system of gazebo update from 1.3 to 1.4, and then appear this error: fatal error: common/CommonTypes.hh: No such file or directory, so I modify the #include "common/CommonTypes.hh" to #include "gazebo-1.4/gazebo/common/CommonTypes.hh", and make it, then appear: fatal error: math/Vector3.hh: No such file or directory

and appear this error:  osrf_msgs/JointCommands.h: No such file or directory, I think other files cannot be found,  like#include <atlas_msgs/ForceTorqueSensors.h>//
//#include <atlas_msgs/ControllerStatistics.h>
//#include <sensor_msgs/JointState.h> how to solve it ,thank you

I follow this tutorial :http://gazebosim.org/wiki/DRC/UserGuide and http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials/1.4/ros_enabled_model_plugin,  I hope I can use a plugin like atlas to control 7 joints and can measure all the force and torque of these joints, so I copy atlasplugin.cc and atlasplugin.hh, and want to modify them to meet my need, but I meet lot of question,

A:

Seems like the problem could be with the location of gazebo header files.
If they were installed from sources using no cmake variable to control destination, they are probably in /usr/local/include. /usr/local should be supplied as include path to the compiler.
You could try several solutions or workarounds, always keep the <common/CommonTypes.hh> this way, do not modify it:

Install gazebo from ubuntu packages. Problem locating <common/CommonTypes.hh> should not appear.
Install gazebo from sources using cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
Modify the tutorial cmake to include /usr/local

Hope this helps.
