Q:

Indigo Installation - Ubuntu 14.04 Permission errors

Hello,
To start I am new to both Ubuntu and ROS.
I am trying to follow the installation guides but am getting bogged down in permissions errors.
I installed and removed ROS Indigo once already because I couldn't access the package files for whatever reason.
Now I received this error while running "rosdep update" (step 1.5 of indigo installation instructions)
daver@DSRUbuntu:~$ rosdep update
reading in sources list data from /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d
ERROR: Rosdep experienced an error: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/daver/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache'
Please go to the rosdep page [1] and file a bug report with the stack trace below.
[1] : 
rosdep version: 0.10.27
Traceback (most recent call last):

mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/daver/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache'
I've tried changing the root folder permissions but it's not applying correctly... I received similar errors on my previous installation attempt (not at this step, but later) and I was able to re-route the temporary cache files but I don't think that applies here.
Any suggestions would be sincerely appreciated.

A:

Delete the .ros ROS folder with sudo (make sure you're not deleting something useful) and rerun rosdep update - NO SUDO HERE!

Thanks for the reply dornhege - unfortunately it doesn't seem to have worked. Again, I'm showing my ignorance but I couldn't delete /home/daver/.ros achieving the error;
daver@DSRUbuntu:~$ sudo rm -f /home/daver/.ros [sudo] password for daver: rm: cannot remove ‘/home/daver/.ros’: Is a directory
followed shortly by the same error as before:
daver@DSRUbuntu:~$ sudo rm -f /home/daver/.ros/ros daver@DSRUbuntu:~$ rosdep update reading in sources list data from /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d
ERROR: Rosdep experienced an error: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/daver/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache'
Furthermore, I can't actually find this directory in the file explorer. I'm very confused about what is actually going on here.

You can't see the directory in the file explorer because its name starts with ".", meaning it is hidden. Try pushing Ctrl+h in the file explorer (nautilus) to toggle hidden file visibility. The other error "...is a directory..." means you need to add   "-r" to rm to indicate "recursive" delete.

So command would be sudo rm -rf /home/daver/.ros @dornhege is correct... be careful when running commands like this.
