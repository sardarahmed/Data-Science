Q:

Flush subscription

I have a Ros::Subscriber that receives messages from a topic. Since I'm doing some computations on the data I receive (and it requires some time), the delay with which I read new messages tend to increase.
Is there a way to "flush" all the unread messages in a topic so that I can read directly the newest one? (I'm using electric on ubuntu 11.10)

A:

If you set the buffer size to 1 in the call to subscribe, you drop all but the newest message.
