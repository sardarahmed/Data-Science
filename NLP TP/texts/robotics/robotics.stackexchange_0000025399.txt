Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: Libogre Error

Hi all,
I am facing a problem with Gazebo. When I install it on my machine running Ubuntu Linux 12.04, it works fine but when I restart the computer and try to run it, it gives me the following error.
gazebo: error while loading shared libraries: libOgreRTShaderSystem.so.1.7.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Has any body else faced the same problem? What might be the possible solution?

A:

Make sure you sourced the setup.sh file that is installed in /usr/share/gazebo-<version>.
I place the following line in my ~/.bashrc file so that setup.sh is sourced at the appropriate time:

source /usr/share/gazebo-1.2/setup.sh
