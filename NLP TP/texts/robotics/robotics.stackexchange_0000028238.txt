Q:

Benefit of creating a model plugin when a world plugin exists

Is there a benefit to using a model plugin to change the state of a model, if a world plugin that can do that already exists? Or let's say I have 10 models that I want to manipulate at the same time? Or more general, benefit of using "lower level" plugins, when "higher level" ones exist.

A:

Whatever you do in a model plugin, you should also be able to do in a world plugin.
Sometimes using a model plugin is more convenient, e.g. when new models are inserted, the model plugin will run automatically, whereas in a world plugin you will have to monitor newly inserted models and verify that's it's the model that you want.
