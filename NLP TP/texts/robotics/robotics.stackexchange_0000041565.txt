Q:

rosrun Error even when package compiles successfully

Hi all! As seen from my previous posts, its been only about a month since I started using ROS. So pardon me if I am making any newbie error here.
I am trying to run a node on ros, but I am unable to do so. Here are the details:
package name: robot_node
ros version: ROS electric
Ubuntu version: Ubuntu Oneiric 32-bit

I opened a terminal and said

roscore

I went to the folder of the package and said rosmake

roscd robot_node
rosmake
This works perfectly fine. I am able to compile with 0 failures.

My executable is called 'robot_node.cpp' so I do the following

rosrun robot_node robot_node
And then, I get this 'error':
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named robot_node below ~/ros_workspace/ROS/robot_node
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,
[rosrun] or not executable:
[rosrun]   ~/ros_workspace/ROS/robot_node
There are a few things you should know that I already tried. These are

I checked the CMakeLists.txt for the package, and it does have the add_executable line.

2)I compiled all the first dependencies of the package separately, and they all compiled perfectly with 0 failures.

robot_node.cpp does have a int main() routine. :P

Any kind of help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time!

Hey dornhege, here are your answers:
1)

A:

The output of make obviously shows an error, that's why no binary file is generated. The problem probably is your call to ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND where you depend on another library. Did you check that the file libABBInterpreter.a really exists?
