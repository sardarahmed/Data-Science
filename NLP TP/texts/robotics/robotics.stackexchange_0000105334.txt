Q:

Couldn't find executable named microstrain_mips_node

I installed ROS microstrain_mips using git clone in my workspace. Here is the Wiki page of the package. However, my current ROS version is Noetic, and the package supports Indigo. When I try to execute the launch file after installation, I encounter an error saying, Couldn't find executable named microstrain_mips_node.

I'm curious if ROS microstrain_mips is compatible with Noetic.
If microstrain_mips_node isn't running as it should, I'm wondering how to resolve this issue.

I've already executed catkin_make and source ./devel/setup.bash before running roslaunch.
My OS is Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. When I clone the package into the existed WS, the package is not installed in ./devel/lib folder, so I did't get any output of: find . -name microstrain_mips_node. However, when i clone the package into a new workspace, it worked in it. In the existed WS, there are a couple of python ROS packages. Do you think it is the problem?

A:

Welcome to Robotics Stack Exchange!
I could successfully install microstrain_mips package on ROS Noetic in Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. Below are the steps, I followed:
$ mkdir -p ~/microstrain_ws/src/
$ cd ~/microstrain_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/microstrain_mips.git
$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
$ cd cd ~/microstrain_ws/
$ source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
$ catkin_make

Next, I was able to run the node. It showed some obvious error as I don't have the device connected. However, until here, it seems to be working well.
$ source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
$ source devel/setup.bash 
$ roscore
$ rosrun microstrain_mips microstrain_mips_node

[FATAL] [1699613921.568017008]: Couldn't open serial port!  Is it plugged in?

I can also run microstrain.launch as shown below:
$ roslaunch microstrain_mips microstrain.launch
