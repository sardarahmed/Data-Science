Q:

how are you suppose to use the param tag

im using rtabmap and i think im using the params wrong. where do i need to place them do they need to go inside the node tag like:
<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rgbd_odometry" name="rgbd_odometry">
        <param name="Odom/ResetCountdown"              value="1" />
</node>

or does it need to be outside the node tag like:
<param name="Odom/ResetCountdown"              value="1" />

<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rgbd_odometry" name="rgbd_odometry">
</node>

or do both methods work and if they do whats the different between the 2.

A:

This one works:
<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rgbd_odometry" name="rgbd_odometry" output="screen">
        <param name="Odom/ResetCountdown"              value="1" />
</node>

...

For rgbd_odometry, those parameters are private. To use the other approach, you should do (prefix with name of the node):
<param name="rgbd_odometry/Odom/ResetCountdown"              value="1" />
<node pkg="rtabmap_ros" type="rgbd_odometry" name="rgbd_odometry" output="screen"/>

ok i don't understand why but that still doesn't set the parameter and i decided to just rtabmap and do rosparam list and for some reason i don't see any of the odom parameters the 2 im trying to change are Odom/ResetCountdown and Odom/Strategy
