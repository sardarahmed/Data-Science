Q:

How to set an estimated position without using rviz

In my project, I want to use multiple turtlebots to navigate in a previously known map to patrol an area.
My netbooks uses 2GB of RAM and an Atom N455 processor - it is not so good as D525, but i think it could make some things on ROS...
I noticed that rviz and another graphic processes requires a lot of processing and video resources, so I want to avoid using rviz and those processes, because I don't need graphical resources.
But how can I set a estimated position of the robots without using rviz?
And do you believe that my current netbook (Atom N455 and 2GB RAM) can support an autonomous navigation?
Thanks in advance,
Lucas

A:

You could try using one of the lightweight rviz alternatives for machines with little graphics power. Those can be found here.
Additionally, you could create your own initialpose message and publish it to amcl that way (if you know the robot's pose). The initialpose message is of the type geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped.
EDIT: For this message type, the seq field is filled in by ROS automatically, and the stamp is zero, so you can ignore both of those fields. The frame_id is /base_link. Finally, the covariance is a 6x6 matrix that is filled in with set values. I've provided an example message below that was taken straight from Rviz.
header: 
  seq: 14
  stamp: 
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: /base_link
pose: 
  pose: 
    position: 
      x: -5.48213577271
      y: -3.74665260315
      z: 0.0
    orientation: 
      x: 0.0
      y: 0.0
      z: 0.457581479883
      w: 0.889167694683
  covariance: [0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06853891945200942, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

the xyzw is quaternion notation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion

Thanks again! W is the scalar part, isn't? And is the covariance matrix filled by ROS? Or should I always use those values?

I really appreciate your help! But... how can I use that message type? I did not understood what should I use in covariance, seq, stamp and frame_id...  And which node does the position of the robot is published?
