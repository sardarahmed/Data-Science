Q:

How to set relative paths in the node  included in a manifest.xml for ROSJava

Currently, I have a package running a solution which uses external java libraries. The solution use external libraries, but I would like to use relative path to the package. With this idea, all libraries would be included in lib folder.
Current solution is this one:
<export>
    <rosjava-src location="src" /> 
    <rosjava-pathelement location="target/" groupId="org.lejos.ros" artifactId="org.lejos.ros.nodes.NXTLoader" version="0.0.1" built="true" />
    <rosjava-pathelement location="/usr/local/lejos/lib/pc/pccomm.jar" />
    <rosjava-pathelement location="/usr/local/lejos/lib/pc/3rdparty/bluecove-gpl.jar" />
    <rosjava-pathelement location="/usr/local/lejos/lib/pc/3rdparty/bluecove.jar" />
    <rosjava-pathelement location="/home/jabrena/ros3/workspace/nxt_lejos_ros/NXTLoader/lib/yamlbeans-1.06.jar" />
</export>

My idea is to describe something similar to this one:
        <rosjava-pathelement location="./lib/pc/pccomm.jar" />
        <rosjava-pathelement location="./lib/bluecove-gpl.jar" />
        <rosjava-pathelement location="./lib/bluecove.jar" />
        <rosjava-pathelement location="./lib/yamlbeans-1.06.jar" />

Is it possible in a alternative way?

A:

If the path is relative, it will be evaluated as relative to the root of the package.

If the path doesn't start with a "/" then it is relative to the root of the ROS package where the manifest.xml lives. For example, if you have /foo/bar/manifest.xml and a location "lib/baz.jar" it will resolve to /foo/bar/lib/baz.jar.

Hi Damon, I didn't understand your answer. Using the syntax: "" I didn't use relative paths. Does exist another way? Cheers
