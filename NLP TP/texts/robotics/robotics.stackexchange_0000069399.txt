Q:

Camera Calibration with Freenect Kinect driver

Hello,
I'm working with a Kinect and the Freenect driver package.
The Kinect is working fine and the distances provided are also fine. But I think I should calibrate the Kinect, if I do not people might call me stupid or something. I can calibrate the Kinect using opencv_cam_calibration package. This package gives a camera_conf.xml file that is the configuration of the camera. I can convert the file from .xml to .yaml.
My question is where do I put this file in the Freenect Kinect driver? I can't seem to find the place where to put it.
Anyone knows? Thanks so much!

A:

I found out.
You need to put the .yaml confg file in: home/user_name/.ros/camera_info/camera_config.yaml file.

Shouldn't that file be automatically written? http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration

I used that package, I did it this morning. Yes it creates the file, but then you have to put it that place so the freenect package can detect the file. I had to rename the file also.
