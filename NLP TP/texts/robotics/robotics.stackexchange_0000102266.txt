Q:

Turtlebot2 Rviz 2d_pose_estimation and 2d_nav_goal don't work

I am using a remote computer to control my real turtlebot2.
When I  roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch and I drag the 2d_Pose_Estimate button arrow on the map, nothing happens.
I have checked <fixed_frame>, it's the map, I have checked the /initialpose, and I get information when I use the pose estimate button but the turtlebot2 does not move at all.
I check my rostopic list and I see /initialpose there and everything. I don't get it.
Could I be missing some udev rule thing on my remote PC?
My turtlebot2 uses a Kinect camera as sensor, 2d_Pose_Estimate works on theros_master_uri laptop the turtlebot2 is physically connected to.
I can see that I am publishing to the /initialpose on the terminal, but the robot still does not move in Rviz.
In the laptop physically connected to the turtlebot2, I have ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP set to the IP of the robot. On the other Remote PC I have ROS_MASTER_URI set to the IP of the robot, and ROS_IP set to the IP of the remote PC. Did I do it wrong?

Can you add in the edit a picture from the rqt_graph of your nodes and their connections? Can you ping IP addresses both ways (robot <--> remote PC)? Does standard check talker/listener works for you?

@ljaniec When I switch the camera to realsense, it works now for some reason. I had another question about path planning for turtlebot2. Is there some topic that telle you that a plan cant be generated? I have a fuller explanaition of my question here
