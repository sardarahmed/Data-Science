Q:

ROS Answers SE migration: rosbag play

Hi all!
I record a topic with rosbag record topic and I could play the bag file. The topic I record was only published for example every five seconds, but when I play the bag file the topic was not published with the same time, but much shorter. Can I change this? I need the same break/time between topic publish and next topic publish which I had when I record this.
Thanks for help.

A:

rosbag usually plays back at the speed it recieved data.  If you can show a way to reproduce this it may be a bug, but it is designed to do what you want.
