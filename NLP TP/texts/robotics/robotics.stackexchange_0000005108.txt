Looking for a cheap(ish) micromouse that I can program with C/C++

I'm looking to buy a micromouse (i.e. a small single-board unit with wheels and IR sensors that can move around freely). I've done a lot of searching but have only found resources relating to building one from components bought separately. However, I'm more of a programmer than an electrician so I fear I would struggle with this.
Anybody know where to buy one of these in the UK? (PICAXE does some suitable stuff but they're BASIC only unfortunately). My budget is about Â£60.

A:

Try a Pololu 3Pi. They were going for 50usd during black friday. Normally $99.  You can use arduino IDE to program it using Wiring, a C/C++ like language.
You would probably have to add IR sensors yourself, either via the expansion board, or re-wire the existing line detectors
At the moment, Hobby Robots are still only reachable by those with soldering skills. But that will be changing in the next few years.
