Q:

How to achieve duplex communication? (listen/talk simultaneously)

For example, if I want my machine1 to send its updated status to machine2, and I also want my machine2 to also do the thing in the reverse direction. How should I do that?
constraint:

Both machines are executing some missions (e.g. path following), so it is not a duplex messaging project.

Please show me a little more detail on whatever package/method you recommend because I am  a beginner on ROS (I have read almost all ROS beginner's tutorials), and my deadline is approaching.
Truly thankful.

A:

If you have a reliable connection you could set the ros master on one of the machines, and then have a topic published by each machine that contain whatever data you want to send.
Each machine publishes it's own topic and subscribes to the other machine's topic.
Overview for python:

You can find many examples in the tutorial section.
