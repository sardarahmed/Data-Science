Q:

Where is the list of groovy variants that I can select?

Hi, I'm trying to build groovy on ubuntu 12.4, following www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Source .
The following works fine
roslocate info ackermann_msgs
but if I try to get info for desktop or desktop-full variants, as described at ros.org/reps/rep-0131.html#variants , I get
~/ros$ roslocate info desktop
cannot locate information about desktop

Where is the list of variants that I can select?
thanks

thanks! (I have not enough karma to post a comment on the answer)
When I run apt-cache search ros-groovy I get many groovy packages, but not the variant one. Maybe because I'm in 32bits and beta is only available for 64?

A:

roslocate indicates the source or (meta-)packages.
Variants listed in rep-131 will show up as
ros-groovy-desktop
when you run
 apt-cache search ros-groovy | grep variant

For a list of packages, there will be a website here where you can use the name of the variant, e.g.:
http://packages.ros.org/web/rosinstall/generate/groovy/desktop
but this is currently work-in-progress, so expect things to break before groovy release.
Once this is stable, instructions to install from source will be at
http://ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Source
