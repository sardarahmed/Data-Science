Q:

netpbm fails to install when installing with Homebrew on OS X

When building packages that depend on netpbm on OS X using Homebrew, netpbm fails to install due to a libpng version mismatch.  This only seems to occur on Xcode 4.2.1 but could affect others.
Here is the error output:

A:

There is a work around until it is fixed upstream within Homebrew:
brew install netpbm --HEAD
And then resume using normal ROS commands.
