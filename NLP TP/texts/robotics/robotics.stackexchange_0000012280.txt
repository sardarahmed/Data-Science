Q:

How to pick up a card from a pile

I don't know if this is a purely "robot" question or a more DIY/hackish one, but let's give it a try.
I currently have a set of cards that I want to sort based on several criteria.
My setup includes:  

MeArm A 4 DOF robot arm  
Raspberry Pi 3 + Shields for controlling the arm
A mini vacuum pump, hold in place by the gripper

These are the steps:

Move the arm on top of pile of cards
Turn on the vacuum pump
Pick the first card
Move the arm in the right spot
Turn off the pump and let the card fall
Repeat

Everything is working fine, my only main issue occurs when I'm lifting the arm. It seems that between the cards there are some kind of forces and under the first one, several others come up, attached.
I tried to shake the arm and make them fall, but it's not working.
Any suggestions? Maybe I'm missing some simple/obvious solution.

A:

If your cards are like playing cards, they are likely very smooth. Cards like this can adhere or bond together in a similar way to "wringing" gauge blocks: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_block#Wringing
The phenomena isn't that well understood, but is thought to be a combination of air pressure, surface tension and/or molecular attraction when two very flat surfaces are brought into contact.
To pick up a single card, you could try a different movement to help break the adhesion between cards, or, if possible, modify the cards to make them less likely to adhere. For example, roughing up the card surfaces may help.
