Q:

Extremely large network traffic using RosLibJs - possible solutions

Hello!
I am using RosLibJs for a web GUI that shows robot data like position, battery status, map etc.
Unfortunately, it uses a lot of network traffic (around 20 GBytes per day!). I am thinking this is due to the direct subscriptions to topics and the high frequency the robot emits data on those topics (like at 10 Hz, for example).
Now, I am unsure how to solve this problem. I thought of 2 possible solutions, maybe you people can help me with it:

Create specialized nodes that only publish data when needed and not in the frequency the robot requires it internally,
Request data periodically from JS side and offer a service from ROS side.

Do you have other ideas? Is there maybe a simpler way?
Thank you!

20 GB a day would seem to equal around 240 KB/sec. That is quite some traffic. Would make sense to try and figure out what contributes most to that 240 KB/sec and start from there.

A:

This would be a good use for a throttle node (http://wiki.ros.org/topic_tools/throttle). What it does is subscribe to a topic and then republishes it on "<originaltopic>_throttle" at a given rate or bandwidth cap. It is just a single command to run and really easy to add to a launch file. Then in your javascript web page you subscribe to the throttled topic.
