Q:

SBPLLatticePlannerStats.h file not found

the file SBPLLatticePlannerStats.h is missing from the sbpl_lattice_planner package available on https://kforge.ros.org/navigation/experimental/file/7ad215f4368f/sbpl_lattice_planner/include/sbpl_lattice_planner.
$ rosmake sbpl_lattice_planner on ubuntu 11.04 with ros electric gives following error:

@gautam: can you paste the exact error that you receive regarding sbpllatticeplannerstats.h? I can build the stack just fine.
Comment by gautam on 2012-07-10:
@piyush: the code sbpl_lattice_planner.cpp requires sbpllatticeplannerstats.h header file which is not present in the include directory of the package. kindly tell me if you have this file in your include folder. If you have it then where did you get the source from?  Because it is absent in the
Comment by gautam on 2012-07-10:
source repository (link mentioned above).

A:

I think you are misinterpreting the error. The error states that the sbpl package was not found. You need to install the motion_planners stack before you can build the sbpl_lattice_planner package.
