Where do you define $ROS_ROOT? Please edit your question and add the relevant contents of your .bashrc

A:

Your setup.sh tries to set ROS_ROOT for you based on all entries in your .rosinstall file. It looks for any entry in your .rosinstall which is a stack with the name 'ros'.
So in your .rosinstall, there are two entries fulfilling that condition, and you need to remove one of those from your .rosinstall.
Which one of these entries you have to remove is up to you. If you explain why you have a 'ros' stack in  /home/iohan/ros/ros we can help more.
