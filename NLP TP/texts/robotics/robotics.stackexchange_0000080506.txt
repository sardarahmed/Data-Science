Q:

rtabmap depth_registration?

I am using rtabmap. rtabmap requires depth/image (sensor_msgs/Image). Does it need a rectified registered depth image or just the raw registered depth image?
I am guessing the registered depth image needs to be in meters.

A:

If it is registered to color camera, raw or rect would be the same. The depth should be 1 channel 16bits unsigned for mm or 1 channel 32bits float for meters.
cheers
