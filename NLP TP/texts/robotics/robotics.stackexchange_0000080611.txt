Q:

Node to convert tf messages to tf2

Hello,
I know tf is depreciated, and that it has been transfered to tf2. I was wondering if anyone has an idea how to convert tf messages to tf2. Particularly, I am using laser scan matcher that is supposed to be supported only till indigo. The laser scan matcher is based off tf, so it possible to transfer tf to tf2? I am new to this, not sure how to do it.
I have looked at the tutorials for tf2, but I am not sure how to build a node for this. Any suggestions, or guidance is appreciated.  Here are the links I have looked through:
Laser Scan Matcher Link: http://wiki.ros.org/laser_scan_matcher
TF2 Conversion: http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials
Software: Ubuntu 16.04, Kinetic
Thanks.

A:

The present tf implementation uses tf2 for its underlying message and data handling.
So, I think the job has already been done.
