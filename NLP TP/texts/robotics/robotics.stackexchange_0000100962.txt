Q:

How to convert a Pose to PyKDL Frame in python (and vice versa)

In ROS1 I used tf_conversions.posemath, toMsg and fromMsg.  I'm porting my code to ROS2 and I can't seem to find the Python3 module tf_conversions.  If the module existing, what is the debian package to install (Ubuntu 20.04/Galactic)?  If not, is there a different module/API available?

A:

toMsg and fromMsg were not ported to ROS 2. Refer to this discussion:
https://github.com/ros-visualization/visualization_tutorials/commit/93009e916ffafbd07e183efd2829101c4c2bd88e
You can use:
void tf2::convert(const A & a, B & b)

https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/tf2/html/namespacetf2.html#af1255c37833c838543b512febce5e9b1
convert() function converts any type to any type (messages or not). Matching toMsg and from Msg conversion functions need to exist. If they don't exist or do not apply (for example, if your two classes are ROS messages), just write a specialization of the function.
