Q:

RosCore on Android fails

Hello. I have put together the most basic project I could to show this error.
https://github.com/FutureHax/BrokenRos
When ros core is started on the Android device, message fail to be passed through.
Start the app, use the MasterChooser to start a new public master.
Point your computer to the ros core instance on your phone.
Attempt to push a message.
What I see when attempting this steps is the following.
03-16 16:51:16.012  30235-30842/com.cloudspace.coretester E/XmlRpcErrorLoggerï¹• No such handler: system.multicall

I have seen a few other issues mention this "system.multicall" line, but none have been resolved.
Am I doing something incorrect or is there a bug in the ros code?

If you really feel this is a bug, perhaps reporting it directly on the rosjava and/or android_core issue trackers would be more efficient.

I have the same problem using roscore on Android. This seems to be a bug in ROS Java: roslaunch uses XML-RPC function system.multicall - which is not supported by rosjava.
Have somebody any idea how to fix this?

A:

This would seem to be fixed with the merge of rosjava/rosjava_core#273.
