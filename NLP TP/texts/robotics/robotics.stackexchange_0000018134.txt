Q:

I must determine the resolution of a control system when using an 8-bit encoder for a single-rotation joint

 
The length of the link is 50 cm and the arm moves 180 degrees. Can anyone help me?
Out of the cosine theorem, $d = \ell \sqrt{2\left(\ell-cos\right)}$, I calculated the distance traveled by a linear axis and the rotation arc through the rotation connection. 
The circumfence is $2\pi R$. And $d$, for my drawing is $d=50\sqrt{2\left(50+1\right)}=50\sqrt{101}$
The distance is 502 cm and the rotation is 9000 cm. From here, I don't know what to do. I can't find any equation for the resolution.
I only have the values that I said, and I need to determine the resolution for the control system, when an encoder of 8-bit is used. I don't have anything else..This is the whole exercise. I understand if it's not clear enough. It isn't for me, either.

A:

I think I understand what you need. You have an arm (length L) rotating (a maximum of Θmax radians) around an axis (similar to the hand of a watch), and the motion is generated by some motor. The motor's position is read by an encoder with a resolution of 8 bits.
We assume that the 8 bits cover the angles between 0 and 2*PI radians. In this case, the resolution of the encoder is:

resEnc=2*PI/(2^8)

The resolution of the angle of the arm would be:

res(Θ)=resEnc

In the same way, the resolution of movement of the tip of the arm is:

resTip = l * res(Θ)

Note: we do not know how the motor is connected to the arm and we do not know how the encoder is connected tot he motor.
Note2: I may have understood why d is needed :D
