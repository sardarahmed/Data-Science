Q:

LocalPathPlanner PoseStamped

Hello Guys,
I want to use the data by the localpath planner.
The Data Type is nav_msgs/Path and I am using with my node a pointer to get for example the x coordinate:
ROS_INFO("Data x [%f]", pathConstPtr->pose[i].pose.position.x);

Which works fine, but I have no idea how I can find out how many poses I have?
Are there some kind of methods to get the size of the posestamped?

A:

You can call the size() method on pathConstPtr->poses : arrays in messages are mainly handled as std::vector from cpp.
