Q:

Equivalent of "catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" with catkin build?

For a release configuration with optimizations and no debugging symbols, I can use the Release build type:
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Is there an equivalent command line with catkin build?

A:

Use the following:
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

EDIT: you might want to look into the docs.
RE single package: I think that is simply done by catkin build <package you want to optimize> with the flag and removing the CMake flag when building the others. Also note that you should comment under my answer, not post a new answer...and possibly accept the answer if I solved your issue.

@aPonza thank you very much, it works and do you know if it is possible to optimize a package only?
