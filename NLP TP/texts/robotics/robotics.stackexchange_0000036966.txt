Q:

move_base - moving backwards

Is there a way to configure move_base to follow paths forward and backward?
I have been able to create paths composed of forward and backward segments with SBPL, but move_base tries always to complete the path rotating and moving forward.
Thanks,
Robert

A:

Have a look at pose_follower as local planner in move_base. It's not really documented and needs some parameter tuning, but it will follow your originally planned path very closely. I believe both DWA and Trajectory Rollout will try to optimize your path and avoid backwards motion.

You are right, thanks.

Keep in mind that that topic is not where move_base get's its global plan from. If you look at the source (line 362ish of sbpl_lattice_planner.cpp) you'll see that it does set yaw angle for the plan move_base gets (following the BaseGlobalPlanner interface).

Hi, thank you, I will test this right now. I have just realized that the path published by /move_base_node/SBPLLatticePlanner/plan is the sequence of poses, but without orientation information (just x,y fields are used), so it might be hard for the planner to decide where to move forward and backward...
