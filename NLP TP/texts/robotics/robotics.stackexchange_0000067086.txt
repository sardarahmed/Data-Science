I got this error when I run command "catkin_make" I am trying to run rgbdslam_v2 on ROS Indigo.Ubuntu version 14.04
Complete execution with error is mentioned above.

I followed the same steps mentioned here  http://felixendres.github.io/rgbdslam_v2/

A:

I've changed the line in the src/rgbdslam_v2/CMakeLists.txt to the following:
SET(LIBS_LINK GL GLU cholmod /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcxsparse.so.3.1.2 #/usr/lib/libcxsparse.so.2.2.3
${G2O_LIBRARIES} ${QT_LIBRARIES} ${QT_QTOPENGL_LIBRARY} ${GLUT_LIBRARY} ${OPENGL_LIBRARY} ${OpenCV_LIBS})

And the package compiled. I guess author haven't made a proper cmake search module for it just yet.

Thanks for reply.I just replaced the newer version with older one and it works fine for me.

Worked for me, thanks a lot! Just one thing, you forgot one closing bracket and that might generate weird error messages
