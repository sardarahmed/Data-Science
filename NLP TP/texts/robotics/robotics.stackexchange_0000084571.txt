Q:

costmap parameters - navigation stack

Hello,
for me it's unclear what parameters have to/can be in common_costmap_params.yaml, local_costmap_params.yaml and global_costmap_params.yaml
This tutorial http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup doesn't really help me.
To start with I just want to use a hand-drawn static map.
Every yaml file i could find in github projects uses different parameters / is otherwise structured. I want to use it together with dwa_local_planner. Also the parameters here differ from project to project and it seems that the ROS Wiki doesn't cover every parameter possible.
At the moment I always get the message "dwa planner failed to produce path". To find the problem I think it would be good the be full aware of the possible parameters and their influence on the system.
I appreciate any help / possible guides.

A:

The total cost of a cell in a costmap is calculated from a set of layers that, together, define the whole costmap. The three most common layers and the associated documentation of all parameters are:

Static Map Layer
Obstacle Map Layer
Inflation Layer

Nearly all the examples you have likely found on GitHub are using defining the parameters in their YAML files according to the documentation on the 3 previous links. Note that there is also an old, pre-Hydro way of defining costmap params that you may still find lurking on the internet, and there are a few additional layers that people have developed. This is all described at the end of the costmap_2d page.
