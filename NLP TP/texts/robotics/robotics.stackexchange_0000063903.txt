Q:

Unable to locate ros-indigo on a Raspberry Pi

Hi, i'm trying ROS indigo on a raspberry pi with wheezy raspbian as OS. Now i'm trying to install the simulator requested in This link but it can't find it. I also tried looking for ros-indigo-* but obtained nothing.

A:

Not all packages are available for raspberry pi. There are installation instructions for groovy. http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation/Raspbian
However, most of the more recent efforts for ARM support have been focused on more standard armhf processors.
