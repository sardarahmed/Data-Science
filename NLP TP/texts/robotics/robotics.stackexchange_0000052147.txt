Q:

[ERROR] Failed to load nodelet

hi
i try to move my Husky A200 a little bit smoother. Therefor i've installed the yocs_velocity_smoother. But it doesn't start. Nodelet failed to load. I saw that others have nearly the same problems and they only must add a new library through the "CMakeLists.txt" file. But i don't know which library i had to add. My error look like this:
[ERROR] [1371736335.535348833]: Failed to load nodelet [/velocity_smoother] of type [yocs_velocity_smoother/VelocitySmootherNodelet]: Could not find library corresponding to plugin yocs_velocity_smoother/VelocitySmootherNodelet. Make sure the plugin description XML file has the correct name of the library and that the library actually exists.
[FATAL] [1371736335.535624567]: Service call failed!

thanks for help

A:

Are you running multiple machines? If so make sure the yocs_velocity_smoother is installed on the remote machine.  (The machine running the nodelet_manager is the critical one)
